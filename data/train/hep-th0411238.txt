    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite predicts that type iib string theory on @xmath13 , with appropriately chosen self  dual five  form flux , is dual to an @xmath14 four  dimensional superconformal field theory whenever @xmath15 is _ sasaki  einstein _ @xcite .",
    "this latter condition may be defined as saying that the metric cone over @xmath15 s^2 ( c(y_5 ) ) = r^2 + r^2 s^2 ( y_5)[metcone]is ricci  flat khler _",
    "i.e. _ calabi  yau . the superconformal field theory may be thought of as arising from a stack of d3branes sitting at the tip of the calabi  yau cone .",
    "notice that , unless @xmath15 is the round metric on @xmath16 , appropriately normalised , the tip of the cone at @xmath17 will be singular .",
    "it is a striking fact that , until very recently , the only sasaki ",
    "einstein five  manifolds that were known explicitly in the literature  recall that this is the blow  up of @xmath18 at @xmath19 points  with a certain symmetric configuration of the @xmath19 blown  up points .",
    "the corresponding sasaki ",
    "einstein metric on @xmath20 is thus also explicit .",
    "this metric has apparently never been published .",
    "we thank s.t .",
    "yau for pointing this out to us . ]",
    "were precisely the round metric on @xmath16 and the homogeneous metric @xmath21 on @xmath1 , or quotients thereof .",
    "for the five  sphere the calabi ",
    "yau cone is simply @xmath22 and the dual superconformal field theory is the maximally supersymmetric @xmath23 @xmath24 theory . for @xmath21 the calabi ",
    "yau cone is the conifold and the dual @xmath14 superconformal field theory was given in @xcite .    due to the rather limited number of examples in the literature detailed tests of the ads / cft conjecture for more interesting geometries",
    "have been lacking , which are @xmath25 bundles over del pezzo surfaces with @xmath26 points blown up , @xmath27 , even though the general metrics are not known explicitly . ] . indeed , one is restricted to quotients ( orbifolds ) of @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "these have been extensively studied using orbifold techniques which by now are completely standard .",
    "for example , klebanov and witten argued that the field theory for @xmath21 may be obtained via a relevant deformation of the @xmath28 orbifold @xmath29 .",
    "however , this has changed drastically with the recent discovery @xcite of a countably infinite class of _ explicit _ sasaki  einstein metrics on @xmath30 .",
    "these were initially found by reduction and t  duality of a class of supersymmetric m ",
    "theory solutions discovered in @xcite .",
    "the family is characterised by two relatively prime positive integers @xmath31 , with @xmath4 .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of these sasaki  einstein manifolds is that there are countably infinite classes which are both _",
    "regular _ and _ irregular_. these terms are not to be confused with regularity of the metric : the metrics are all smooth metrics on @xmath1 .",
    "rather , they refer to properties of the orbits of a certain killing vector field . indeed , on any sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold @xmath32 there exists a canonically defined killing vector field @xmath33 , called the _ reeb _",
    "vector in the mathematics literature .",
    "the orbits of this killing vector field may or may not close . if they close then there is a ( locally free ) @xmath25 action on @xmath32 and such sasaki  einstein manifolds are called quasi  regular . the geometries @xmath0 with @xmath34 a square are examples of such manifolds .",
    "if the orbits of the reeb vector field do not close the killing vector generates an action of @xmath35 on @xmath32 , with the orbits densely filling the orbits of a torus , and the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold is said to be irregular .",
    "the geometries @xmath0 with @xmath34 _ not _ a square are the first examples of such geometries in the literature . another interesting feature of these metrics is that the volumes are always given by a _",
    "quadratic irrational _ number times the volume of the round metric on @xmath16  recall a quadratic irrational is of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the volumes are rationally related to that of @xmath16 if and only if the sasaki ",
    "einstein is quasi  regular .",
    "recall that all four  dimensional @xmath14 superconformal field theories possess an r  symmetry , commonly referred to as the @xmath25 r  symmetry . however , crucially this symmetry is not always a @xmath25 symmetry  this is true only if the r  charges of all the fields are _ rational_. in general , this is not true , as exemplified by the recent work of @xcite . in the latter reference",
    "it is shown that the exact r  symmetry of a superconformal field theory maximises a certain combination of t hooft anomalies @xmath38 .",
    "the maximal value is then precisely the exact @xmath12 central charge of the superconformal field theory .",
    "since one is maximising a cubic with rational coefficients , the resulting r  charges are always algebraic numbers . recall that in ads / cft the r  symmetry is precisely dual to the canonical killing vector field @xmath33 discussed above .",
    "moreover , the central charge @xmath39 for the field theory dual to @xmath32 is inversely proportional to its volume .",
    "in particular , we have @xcite =  .[central ] it is thus clearly of interest to identify the dual superconformal field theories for the sasaki",
    " einstein manifolds @xmath0 , so as to compare the exact results on both sides of the duality . in this paper",
    "we take the first substantial steps in this program by analysing in considerable detail the geometry of the manifolds @xmath0 , and the associated calabi ",
    "yau cones .",
    "the results allow us to show that the metrics @xmath0 are dual to a class of @xmath9 superconformal field theories arising as ir fixed points of certain toric quiver gauge theories , with gauge group @xmath10 .",
    "the case @xmath40 is somewhat special .",
    "this corresponds to the geometry with largest volume , and is an irregular metric .",
    "the dual field theory therefore has the smallest central charge within the family , and moreover is expected to be _",
    "quadratic irrational_. rather surprisingly , we find that the metric @xmath11 turns out to be an explicit metric on the horizon of the complex cone over the first del pezzo surface .",
    "for this , the corresponding @xmath41 quiver gauge theory and superpotential have already been identified @xcite .",
    "we can then compute the central charge ( [ central ] ) and also the r  charges of the baryons for this theory using ads / cft , where the baryons correspond to d3branes wrapped over 3cycles whose metric cones are supersymmetric cycles ( complex divisors ) in the cone over @xmath11 .",
    "the values we find are all quadratic irrational numbers . at first sight",
    "these results present a puzzle , as the central charge computed in @xcite was found to be a rational number .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the quiver theory shows that the @xmath12maximisation calculation is somewhat more subtle in this case .",
    "indeed , using @xmath12maximisation @xcite applied to the quiver theory , the authors of @xcite find a central charge , as well as r  charges , which agree perfectly with the values obtained using the geometrical results of this paper .",
    "this constitutes an extremely beautiful test of the ads / cft correspondence , as well as the general @xmath12maximisation procedure advocated in @xcite .",
    "given the results presented here , in principle the duals to the remaining geometries , with general @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , can be constructed using the `` toric algorithm '' of @xcite .",
    "these will provide an infinite series of @xmath9 superconformal field theories , whose central charges are generically quadratic irrational",
    ". it will be interesting to obtain these explicitly , and to compare the results of @xmath12maximisation for these theories with the various geometrical results presented in this paper .",
    "however , we leave these calculations for future work .    as a final point",
    ", we note that in @xcite a generalisation of the metrics @xmath0 to all dimensions was presented ( see also references @xcite and @xcite for a generalisation of this generalisation ) .",
    "in particular there are countably infinite classes of supersymmetric solutions @xmath42 to m  theory , which will have three  dimensional cft duals , where the metric @xmath43 is built using any positive curvature khler ",
    "einstein metric in real dimension four @xcite .",
    "these have been classified @xcite . for the case",
    "when the khler ",
    "einstein manifold is _ toric _ , one has only three cases : @xmath18 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where the latter is the third del pezzo surface . using the techniques developed in this paper",
    ", one can show that for the first two cases the metric cones over @xmath43 are given by khler quotients @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively , where the various @xmath25 charges are , with appropriate definitions of the chern numbers @xmath2 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , respectively .      the first point to note about the manifolds @xmath0 , and their associated calabi ",
    "yau cones , is that they are all _",
    "toric_. this essentially means that there is an effective action of a torus @xmath52 on @xmath53 which preserves the symplectic form of the cone and commutes with the homothetic @xmath54 action .",
    "indeed , this torus action is an isometry , and so also preserves the metric . the torus action and symplectic form then allow us to define a _ moment map _",
    ", @xmath55 .",
    "the image in @xmath56 is always a _ good convex rational polyhedral cone _ in @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "these terms will be explained more carefully later .",
    "however , roughly this is a convex cone formed by intersecting some number of planes through the origin . the moment map exhibits @xmath53 as a @xmath57 fibration over this _ moment cone _",
    ", with the fibres collapsing over the faces , or _ facets _ , of the cone in a way determined by the normal vectors to the facets .",
    "we shall find explicitly that the moment cone for @xmath0 is a four  faceted good strictly convex rational polyhedral cone .",
    "having computed the moment cone for @xmath53 we may then apply a _ delzant theorem _",
    "@xcite for symplectic toric cones worked out recently in @xcite . in physics terms , this takes the combinatorial data defining the moment cone and uses it to produce a _ gauged linear sigma model _ @xcite . by construction",
    "the classical vacuum of the linear sigma model is precisely the calabi ",
    "yau cone one started with .",
    "more mathematically , this would be called a symplectic  or , more precisely , khler  quotient of @xmath58 by a compact abelian group .",
    "the final result is :    * _ the metric cones over @xmath0 are explicit calabi  yau metrics for the @xmath25 gauged linear sigma model on @xmath59 with charges @xmath6 , and zero fayet ",
    "iliopoulos parameter .",
    "_    if we denote the vacuum of a linear sigma model by @xmath60 , then it is easy to see that , rather generally , @xmath61 is equivalent to the charges of the @xmath25 gauge group summing to zero .",
    "clearly this is true for the gauged linear sigma model above , and hence @xmath62 is indeed topologically calabi  yau . in this process",
    "we lose precise information about the metric  in particular , the induced metric from @xmath59 is _ not _ ricci  flat .",
    "however , we have now gained an explicit description of the calabi  yau singularity .",
    "indeed , by constructing invariant monomials one also obtains an algebraic description of the singularity",
    ".    we may then give the _ toric diagram _ for the calabi ",
    "yau singularity .",
    "this may be realised as an integral polytope in @xmath63 .",
    "roughly , the four outward pointing primitive normal vectors that define the moment cone lie in a plane as a result of the calabi  yau condition . projecting these vectors onto this plane",
    "yields the vertices of the toric diagram for a minimal presentation of the singularity .",
    "we show that the resulting toric diagrams may all be embedded inside that of the orbifold @xmath8 where the two factors are generated by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , respectively , where @xmath66 is a @xmath67th root of unity .",
    "the vertices of the polytope are then @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( the position of the origin is irrelevant ) and we show that the toric diagram for @xmath53 lives inside this polytope for all @xmath4 and fixed @xmath2 .",
    "geometrically , this means that the calabi ",
    "yau cone @xmath53 may be obtained by ( partial ) toric crepant resolution of the orbifold @xcite .    also ,",
    "as part of our general analysis , we find a class of supersymmetric submanifolds in the geometries @xmath53 .",
    "specifically , we show that the cones over the special orbits of the cohomogeneity one action on @xmath0 are calibrated submanifolds  in fact complex divisors  of the calabi  yau . recall that d3branes wrapped over the horizon 3cycles are dual to baryons in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "we compute the volumes of these submanifolds , and hence give a prediction for the r  charges of the corresponding baryons .    given the toric diagram for @xmath53 there are methods to construct a superconformal field theory , whose higgs branch is the toric variety @xmath71 , purely from the combinatorial data that defines @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the point is that the field theory for the orbifold @xmath8 , in which the geometries are `` embedded '' , is known from standard orbifold techniques .",
    "the calabi ",
    "yau cones @xmath53 are obtained by partial resolution , which amounts to turning on specific combinations of fayet  iliopoulos parameters in the gauged linear sigma model .",
    "the field theories in question are then rather conventional quiver gauge theories with polynomial superpotentials .",
    "the number of nodes of the quiver is simply twice the area of the toric diagram , which is @xmath72 for all @xmath3 with fixed @xmath2 .",
    "rather surprisingly , we find that the toric diagram for @xmath11 is precisely the same as that for the complex cone over the first del pezzo surface .",
    "recall that the latter is the blow  up of @xmath18 at one point , and that the complex cone over this is indeed a real cone over @xmath73 .",
    "it follows that @xmath11 , which is _ irregular _ , is an explicit sasaki  einstein metric on the horizon , or boundary , of this cone .",
    "this is interesting , since the higher del pezzo surfaces , which are @xmath18 with @xmath74 generic points blown up , admit khler ",
    "einstein metrics @xcite .",
    "the complex cones then carry regular sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics .",
    "the case of one or two points blown up has always been something of a puzzle , since these del pezzos do not admit khler ",
    "einstein metrics and thus the sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics associated to the complex cones could not possibly be regular .",
    "we have thus resolved this puzzle , at least in the case of one blow  up .",
    "the quiver gauge theory dual to the complex cone over the first del pezzo surface has been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence then predicts the exact central charge of this theory in the ir .",
    "using the explicit metric @xmath11 , the result we obtain is = = ~  .[ratio]remarkably , this value coincides precisely with a recent application of @xmath12maximisation @xcite to the quiver gauge theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , we also find perfect agreement for the charges of ( @xmath75 singlet ) baryons in the gauge theory .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , after recalling some basic facts about sasaki ",
    "einstein geometry , we give a summary of the construction of the metrics @xmath0 , and recall several of their features . section 3 contains a review of symplectic toric geometry  in particular toric contact geometry  which we use extensively in the remainder of the paper . in section 4 we compute the image of the moment map associated to the toric calabi ",
    "yau cones @xmath53 . in section 5",
    "we apply a delzant construction to obtain a gauged liner sigma model ( glsm ) description of the calabi  yau spaces .",
    "moreover we analyse directly the structure of the moduli space of vacua of the glsm in section 5.3 . in section 6 the associated toric",
    "gorenstein singularities are described . in section 7",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath11 is an irregular metric on the horizon of the complex cone over the first del pezzo surface , and exhibit an explicit ( non  khler and non  einstein ) metric on the latter .",
    "section 8 concludes with a comparison of the geometrical results obtained here with the results of @xmath12maximisation applied to the quiver gauge theory corresponding to the complex cone over the first del pezzo surface @xcite . in appendix",
    "a the techniques used in the paper , which perhaps are unfamiliar to many physicists , are applied to the familiar example of the conifold .",
    "in this section we review the geometry of the recently discovered sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics on @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "there is an infinite family of such metrics , labeled by two coprime integers @xmath76 , @xmath4  we refer to these as @xmath0 .",
    "geometrically they are all @xmath25 principle bundles is * not * to be confused with the isometry generated by the reeb vector .",
    "the latter is embedded non  trivially inside the torus defined by this @xmath25 and and @xmath25 that rotates the axially squashed @xmath77 fibre . ] over an axially squashed @xmath77 bundle over a round @xmath77 .",
    "the integers label the twisting , or chern numbers , of the @xmath25 bundle over the two two  cycles , with the constraint @xmath4 arising as a regularity condition on the metric .",
    "the manifolds are all cohomogeneity one .",
    "the fact that they are all topologically @xmath73 follows from a theorem of smale @xcite on the classification of five  manifold topology .    in the following we first recall basic material about sasakian  einstein geometry and then turn to the metrics @xmath0 .",
    "a sasaki  einstein manifold may be defined as a complete positive curvature einstein manifold whose metric cone is ricci  flat khler _",
    "i.e. _ a calabi  yau cone .",
    "the structure of a sasaki  einstein manifold may thus be thought of as `` descending '' from the calabi ",
    "yau structure of its metric cone ( [ metcone ] ) .",
    "in particular , contracting the euler vector @xmath78 , which generates the homothetic @xmath54 action on the cone , into the khler form gives rise to a one  form on the base of the cone , @xmath32 .",
    "the dual of this is a constant norm killing vector field  called the reeb vector in the mathematical literature  which via the ads / cft correspondence is isomorphic to the r  symmetry of the dual field theory .",
    "the killing vector defines a foliation of the sasaki  einstein manifold , and",
    "one finds that the transverse leaves have a khler ",
    "einstein structure .",
    "more precisely , one can write the _ local _ form of the metric as follows : [ se ] s^2(y ) & = & s^2_4 + (  + ) ^2 where @xmath79 is a local khler ",
    "einstein metric .",
    "in particular we have that [ kestructure ] & = & 2 j_4 + _ 4 & = & i 3 _ 4 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the local khler and holomorphic @xmath82 form for @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the reeb killing vector is given by [ sasvec ] k 3  .",
    "einstein manifolds may then be classified into three families , according to the global properties of the orbits of this killing vector field :    * if the orbits close , and moreover the associated @xmath25 action is free , the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold is said to be * regular*. the length of the orbits are then all equal .",
    "one thus has a principle @xmath25 bundle over a four  dimensional base khler  einstein manifold .",
    "* suppose that the isotropy group @xmath83 of at least one point @xmath84 is non  trivial .",
    "notice that @xmath83 is necessarily isomorphic to @xmath85 , for some integer @xmath86 , since these are precisely the proper subgroups of @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath25 action is then locally free , meaning that the isotropy groups are all finite  note that the killing vector can not vanish anywhere since it has constant norm .",
    "the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold is then said to be * quasi ",
    "regular*. in this case notice that the length of the orbit through @xmath84 is @xmath87 times the length of the generic orbit .",
    "the quotient of any manifold by a locally free compact lie group action is canonically an orbifold .",
    "one thus has a principle orbifold @xmath25 bundle , or orbibundle , over a khler ",
    "einstein base orbifold .",
    "moreover , the point @xmath84 will descend to a @xmath85orbifold point @xmath84 in this base space . * if the orbits do not close , the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold is said to be * irregular*. in this case one does not have a well  defined quotient space .",
    "note that such a sasaki  einstein manifold necessarily has at least a @xmath88 isometry group , @xmath89 , with the orbits of the killing vector filling out a dense subset of the orbits of the torus action .",
    "indeed , the isometry group of a compact riemannian manifold is always a compact lie group .",
    "hence the orbits of a killing vector field define a one  parameter subgroup , the closure of which will always be an abelian subgroup and thus a torus .",
    "the dimension of the closure of the orbits is called the _",
    "rank_. thus irregular sasaki  einstein manifolds have rank greater than @xmath90 .",
    "the five  dimensional regular sasaki ",
    "einstein manifolds are classified completely  @xcite .",
    "this follows since the smooth four  dimensional khler ",
    "einstein metrics with positive curvature on the base have been classified by tian and yau @xcite .",
    "these include the special cases @xmath18 and @xmath91 , with corresponding sasaki  einstein manifolds being the homogeneous manifolds @xmath16 ( or @xmath92 ) and @xmath21 ( or @xmath93 ) , respectively . for the remaining metrics ,",
    "the base is a del pezzo surface obtained by blowing up @xmath18 at @xmath48 generic points with @xmath94 and , although proven to exist , the generic metrics are not known explicitly .",
    "we emphasise the lack of existence of khler ",
    "einstein metrics on the del pezzo surfaces with one or two points blown up , as this will play an important role later .",
    "this fact is actually rather simple to understand .",
    "it is a fairly straightforward calculation @xcite to show that the lie algebra @xmath95 generated by holomorphic vector fields on a khler ",
    "einstein manifold is a complexification of the lie algebra generated by killing vector fields _ i.e. _ isometries .",
    "the latter is always a reductive algebra ( meaning it is the sum of its centre together with a semi  simple algebra ) but for the first and second del pezzo surfaces the algebra @xmath95 is not reductive .",
    "clearly then @xmath95 being reductive is always necessary .",
    "this is matsushima s theorem @xcite .",
    "one also requires that the anti ",
    "canonical bundle be ample , that is @xmath96 , otherwise the putative khler ",
    "einstein metric would be indefinite .",
    "in complex dimension two , these necessary conditions are in fact sufficient for existence of a khler ",
    "einstein metric @xcite , and this leads to the list stated above .",
    "it was only recently  @xcite that quasi ",
    "regular sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics were shown to exist on @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , there are @xmath99 known inhomogeneous sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics on @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that the proof of this is via existence arguments , rather than giving explicit metrics .",
    "specifically , one uses a modification of yau s argument to prove existence of khler ",
    "einstein metrics on certain complex orbifolds , and then builds the appropriate @xmath25 orbibundle over these to obtain sasaki  einstein manifolds .",
    "one can also obtain quasi ",
    "regular geometries rather trivially by taking quotients of the explicit regular geometries discussed above by appropriate freely  acting finite groups .",
    "for example , one can take a freely  acting finite subgroup of @xmath100 and quotient @xmath101 by the induced action .",
    "we will now review , as well as work out some new , properties of the sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "these were presented in @xcite in the following local form : [ tinky ] s^2 & = & ( ^2+^2 ^2)+ y^2+(-)^2 + & + & w(y)^2 + & & s^2(b)+w(y)[+a]^2 where w(y ) & = & + q(y ) & = & + f(y ) & = &  . for @xmath102",
    "the metric takes the local form of the standard homogeneous metric on @xmath21 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath103 can be scaled to 1 by a diffeomorphism .",
    "henceforth we assume this is the case .",
    "the analysis of @xcite first showed that the four dimensional space @xmath104 can be made into a smooth complete compact manifold with appropriate choices for the ranges of the coordinates .",
    "in particular , for the two positive roots become equal and @xmath105 is a double root . in the case",
    "@xmath106 the metric is locally that of the round metric on @xmath16 . ] 0<a<1  , one can take the ranges of the coordinates @xmath107 to be @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 so that the `` base space '' @xmath104 is an axially squashed @xmath77 bundle over a round @xmath77 .",

    "here we are thinking of @xmath25 as the group in which the transition functions of @xmath118 take their values , and @xmath119 as the structure group of the associated oriented @xmath77 bundle over @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath118 has chern number @xmath120 mod @xmath117 , it follows that the @xmath77 bundle is trivial and thus the manifold @xmath104 is topologically a product space , @xmath121 .",
    "the range of @xmath122 is fixed so that @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",

    "one may check explicitly that the metric is smooth here with the above identifications of coordinates .",

    ". in complex coordinates , @xmath294 , this means @xmath295 which identifies antipodal points on the three  sphere .",
    "it follows that the centre of @xmath296 acts trivially and hence the effectively acting isometry group is @xmath297 , where @xmath25 rotates the @xmath134 fibre with weight _ one _  half the weight of @xmath298 .",
    "it now follows that the isometry group for @xmath299 for all odd @xmath86 is @xmath300 , whereas for even @xmath86 it is @xmath301  it is precisely the even cases where @xmath85 contains the antipodal map above .",

    ", if @xmath303 denotes the killing vector that rotates the @xmath77 about its equator with weight one , and @xmath304 denotes the killing vector that rotates the @xmath134 fibre , also with weight one , then @xmath305 do indeed form a basis for an effectively acting @xmath217 .",
    "this is the obvious @xmath217 in @xmath297 .    for @xmath306",
    "one needs to be more careful : the isometry group is @xmath300 .",
    "for example , for @xmath17 one has the unit chiral spin bundle of @xmath77 .",
    "as is well  known , a single rotation of @xmath77 will not result in the spinor coming back to itself : one needs to rotate twice . for an effective action one should thus take a basis @xmath307 , @xmath308 . here",
    "@xmath309 is half the generator of the diagonal @xmath25 in @xmath310 , and @xmath304 generates the @xmath25 factor .    of course , one can use the basis @xmath311 , @xmath308 quite generally in all cases .",
    "indeed , recall that the choice of basis is unique only up to an @xmath312 transformation . for @xmath302",
    "even , this basis is just the @xmath312 transformation (    cc 1 & r + 0 & 1    ) of the basis @xmath313 .      after this brief digression , we return to the case of interest .",
    "first let us note from the results above that the isometry group of the base @xmath104 is @xmath297 .",
    "indeed , for fixed @xmath122 , @xmath314 , we have a copy of @xmath293 , and the group @xmath297 acts with cohomogeneity one on @xmath104 with fixed @xmath122 as generic orbit .",
    "thus , in particular , we may take a basis @xmath315 , @xmath276 for an effectively acting two  torus .",
    "for @xmath53 , one must also add the direction @xmath278 .",
    "however , here one must be careful to ensure the orbits of the vectors close , and that this torus then acts effectively , just as for the lens spaces .",

    "note that one can replace @xmath26 in the formula for @xmath318 by anything congruent to @xmath26 modulo two ( for example , @xmath48 )  this is just an @xmath319 transformation of the torus .",

    "the effectively acting isometry group is thus @xmath320 in this case . for @xmath26 odd",

    "we will now describe the image of @xmath323 , and check that it is given by a good convex rational polyhedral cone in @xmath56 , as predicted by the results of @xcite .",
    "first , note that the edges of the cone can be identified by fixing any non ",

    "we denote the subspaces as follows : @xmath328 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 , @xmath331 .",

    "the first property does not generically hold , but is special to the geometries we are considering . as we will see later , it is related to the fact that the sasaki  einstein manifolds we began with are simply  connected",

    "one may now take the symplectic reduction @xmath395 , which is a symplectic manifold of complex dimension @xmath396 .",
    "moreover , this quotient also inherits an action of @xmath397 from that of @xmath58 and is thus toric .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to see that the image of @xmath395 under its moment map , associated to @xmath201 , is just @xmath237",
    ". this is delzant s construction @xcite .    as a completely trivial example , consider the two  sphere @xmath77 with canonical @xmath25 action which rotates about the equator .",
    "the image of the moment map is just a line segment , with length proportional to the volume of the two  sphere .",
    "the outward pointing normal one  vectors are @xmath398 , @xmath399 .",
    "the kernel of the map @xmath400 is thus @xmath401 , whence we see that @xmath77 is the symplectic reduction of @xmath402 by @xmath25 with charges @xmath401  the @xmath25 quotient is just the hopf map @xmath403 .",
    "there is a corresponding construction for compact symplectic toric orbifolds , which is a generalisation that takes into account that the normals may no longer form a @xmath235basis for @xmath236 .",
    "this introduces finite subgroups @xmath240 which become local orbifold groups in the symplectic quotient @xcite .",

    "it follows that the vacuum manifold @xmath62 of this gauged linear sigma model is topologically calabi  yau , @xmath61 , just as expected .",
    "moreover , by turning on the fayet  iliopoulos parameter @xmath408 for the @xmath25 gauge field we will obtain orbifold resolutions of the cone .    as interesting degenerate cases ,",
    "consider @xmath409 .",
    "this is the ( resolved ) conifold , which recall is the gauged linear sigma model on @xmath59 with charges @xmath410 .",
    "another important case is @xmath411 .",
    "this yields @xmath412 times the linear sigma model on @xmath22 with charges @xmath413 .",
    "the latter is @xmath414 .",
    "taking @xmath415 shrinks the @xmath416 to zero size , yielding the orbifold @xmath417 , which is also the @xmath418 singularity .",
    "thus the cone is @xmath419 .",
    "this has @xmath28 rather than @xmath14 supersymmetry .",
    "the horizons of these two spaces are thus @xmath21 and @xmath29 .",
    "if one formally takes @xmath420 and @xmath421 , one obtains @xmath422 quotients of the cases above . in particular these",
    "will correspond to orbifolds @xmath423 and ( conifold)@xmath424 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that these are consistent with the limiting volumes ( [ limitvolumes ] ) , although the metrics @xmath0 are not valid in these limits .",
    "we can now use the results of @xcite to perform further non  trivial checks . according to theorem 1.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite we have the following general topological facts about the base @xmath32 of the symplectic toric cone @xmath246 we began with ( provided it is of reeb type ) :    * @xmath425 , is a finite abelian group .",

    "in particular , for our polyhedral cones recall that the @xmath258 spanned @xmath341 over @xmath235 , and thus @xmath430 is trivial , in agreement with the fact that @xmath431 for all @xmath31 .",

    "in this subsection we verify that one can recover the topology of , as well as the action of the isometry group on , @xmath0 correctly as the boundary , or horizon , of the linear sigma model @xmath405 .",
    "of course , this is guaranteed by the delzant theorem of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to analyse the relation explicitly , since this sheds considerable light on the geometry and topology .",
    "since this `` hands on '' approach is rather technical , the reader might well omit the remainder of this section .",
    "however , we will need the relation ( [ relvec ] ) between vectors on @xmath59 and @xmath0 in the next section .",
    "this section also constitutes a direct proof of the equivalence of the gauged linear sigma models with the calabi ",
    "yau cones , without using any theorems .",
    "the point of this subsection is to show that the khler quotient @xmath436 is topologically the same as @xmath53 .",
    "this is far from obvious , but is nevertheless guaranteed by the general theorems we have used thus far .    at @xmath437",
    "we have a finite sized @xmath416 , of size @xmath438 , where recall that @xmath408 is the fi parameter .",

    "on the overlap @xmath443 we have @xmath444 , thus making the riemann sphere .",
    "however , for @xmath76 this @xmath416 is a locus of @xmath422 orbifold singularities in the khler quotient .",
    "indeed , the subgroup @xmath445 stabilises the subspace @xmath446 of @xmath59 . the fact that we have a non  trivial isotropy subgroup means that this will descend to a locus of @xmath422 orbifold singularities in the quotient space .",
    "to analyse this singularity , consider , for example , the subspace given by @xmath447 . using a gauge transformation",
    "we may set @xmath448 to be real and positive , which is thus the north pole of the base @xmath449 .",
    "the action of @xmath422 on @xmath450 is generated by @xmath451 where @xmath452 generates @xmath422 .",
    "note that this is equivalent to the anti  diagonal action @xmath453 .",
    "thus if @xmath454 acts on @xmath402 in the usual way , we have that the generator @xmath455 of @xmath422 embeds in @xmath456 as @xmath457 .",
    "notice that @xmath458 and that , for fixed @xmath459 the @xmath379term imposes that the coordinates @xmath460 define an ellipsoid , which topologically is @xmath280 modulo the @xmath422 action just discussed . since @xmath3 is prime to @xmath2 this is the lens space @xmath461 . at @xmath462",

    "thus the subspace @xmath447 is a copy of an @xmath463 singularity . performing the quotient of the lens space `` at infinity '' by @xmath456",
    "then gives a two  sphere , the map being the @xmath2th power of the anti  hopf map of @xmath300 .",

    "in fact such a bundle structure of the metrics @xmath0 was already noted in reference @xcite .",
    "we may then quotient the boundary by @xmath456 to obtain a space @xmath465 that will be an @xmath77 bundle over the base @xmath449 . to see what this bundle is we may introduce coordinates as follows .",

    "in order to effectively go to the boundary of our space , we may set @xmath468 .",
    "in particular , we can not have both @xmath469 and @xmath470 zero .",
    "suppose then that @xmath471 .",
    "we may now introduce the additional coordinate @xmath472 on the fibre .",
    "this is invariant under both the original @xmath25 action  the key point being that @xmath473  as well as @xmath456 under which the fields have charges @xmath474 .",
    "similarly over @xmath475 we have coordinate @xmath476 .",
    "the union of these two subspaces thus describes the bundle @xmath477 .",
    "however , note that , due to the presence of the @xmath478s , the complex structure here is _ not _ inherited from the complex structure of @xmath59 we started with .",
    "since we are only interested in topology and group actions , this fact will not be important for the present discussion .",
    "similarly , for @xmath479 one has coordinates @xmath480 and @xmath481 .",
    "this describes @xmath414 . the intersection of these subspaces results in the gluing of the two @xmath412 fibres together to create a riemann sphere @xmath77 bundle over @xmath449  for example , @xmath482 on the overlap with @xmath483 .",
    "thus we obtain precisely the same description as the manifold @xmath104 discussed earlier : @xmath484 .",
    "topologically , the manifold @xmath465 just described is the same thing as @xmath485 which is the second hirzebruch surface @xmath486 .",
    "however , due to the @xmath478s , the complex structure is not that inherited from @xmath59 . indeed ,",

    "the fibre @xmath77 is thus perhaps best described as @xmath489 . moreover , as explained in @xcite , as a real manifold @xmath486 is actually just a product space @xmath490 _ i.e. _ the bundle is trivial .",

    "we have just seen that the twisting over @xmath493 and @xmath504 is @xmath48 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "this gives the chern numbers over @xmath138 and @xmath139 to be @xmath505 , and @xmath506 , respectively .",
    "we thus precisely reproduce the topology of @xmath0 described in section 2 .",
    "moreover , the ( not quite effectively acting ) isometry group of the sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics is @xmath507 .",
    "the khler quotient above also has this isometry group  this is just the subgroup of @xmath508 that commutes with the original @xmath25 action .",
    "it is also now interesting to examine the codimension two fixed point sets of the linear sigma model @xmath405 directly , and compare with our polyhedral cone for @xmath53 .",

    "turning on the fi parameter @xmath521 in the linear sigma model @xmath405 partially resolves the singularity to an @xmath463 singularity fibred over @xmath416 , as discussed in the last section .",

    "this identifies the canonical bundle , or complex cone , over @xmath547 .",

    "we have found that the metric @xmath11 is an explicit irregular sasaki  einstein metric on the horizon of the complex cone @xmath548 over @xmath547 , where the killing vector field ( [ theta5 ] ) rotates the complex cone direction .",

    "the quotient by @xmath563 now simply gives the metric in the first line of ( [ newmetric ] ) , which again looks like a bundle over a base two  sphere .",
    "let us now analyze regularity of this metric .",
    "first , notice that all the functions are positive semi ",
    "so , as usual , one has to worry only about the smoothness conditions where the function @xmath128 vanishes , and then check that the resulting periodicities give a well  defined bundle  metric .",
    "near such a zero @xmath127 , the `` fibre metric '' , _",
    "i.e. _ the metric at fixed @xmath566 , takes the form s^2 ( ) & & y^2 + ^2  .",

    "[ crucial]introducing @xmath568 we find that for @xmath569  and _ only _ for these values  the metric approaches s^2 ( ) & & ( r^2 + r^2 ^ 2 ) near the two zeros .",
    "we therefore obtain a smooth metric on @xmath63 in this neighbourhood if and only if @xmath168 has period @xmath570 .",
    "indeed , one can see that this is the induced period for @xmath168 from the metric on @xmath11 by examining the coordinate transformation ( [ ct ] ) : since @xmath571 and @xmath572 all have period @xmath153 one can calculate the period of @xmath168 from the jabobian of the coordinate transformation ( [ ct ] ) , which is @xmath573 .",
    "this indeed means that @xmath574 and moreover with this period we have that for fixed @xmath122 , @xmath314 , the resulting space is a squashed @xmath280 .",
    "these are then the generic orbits under the action of the isometry group @xmath300 on this manifold .",
    "we thus obtain an @xmath77 bundle over @xmath77 with twist one , which is topologically @xmath547 , just as expected .",
    "let us now label the two sections of @xmath547 at @xmath316 , @xmath317 as @xmath575 , @xmath576 respectively .",

    "let us first remark that , given a toric gorenstein canonical singularity , an algorithm for constructing a quiver gauge theory that has the singularity as its higgs branch has been developed in @xcite and subsequent works by these authors .",
    "this relies on the fact that any such singularity may be obtained by partial resolution of the orbifold @xmath588 , and the field theory for the latter is known . in practise",
    "the algorithm requires a computer , even for relatively small @xmath2 .",
    "however , the simple analytic expressions found in this paper suggest that all theories can be treated simultaneously .",
    "indeed it is tempting to speculate that some members of the family could be related by deformations or connected via rg  flows . in particular",
    ", we can anticipate that , at fixed @xmath2 , the parameter @xmath3 will govern the matter content and superpotential of an @xmath10 quiver .",
    "recall also that at fixed @xmath2 , the central charge @xmath12 is a monotonic function of @xmath3 which is bounded between the values corresponding to @xmath589 and @xmath590 : a(t^1,1/_p ) < a ( y^p , q ) < a(s^5/_2_p )  , suggesting that the different @xmath3theories might all be related to the same `` parent '' orbifold model .",
    "however , we will not pursue this direction any further in the present paper .",

    "we denote these fields as @xmath597 .",
    "thus the quiver diagram encodes the field content of the theory .",
    "one must also specify the superpotential .",
    "this is given by @xcite : w = _ - _ + _ [ w]where @xmath598 and @xmath599 are indices of the non  abelian flavor symmetry group @xmath75 .",
    "note that each term comes from a closed loop in the quiver .",
    "this allows one to construct gauge ",
    "invariant monomials , which may then appear in the superpotential .",
    "one is then particularly interested in the higgs branch of such a theory .",
    "this arises by considering @xmath600 for each gauge group factor .",
    "one effectively considers the case @xmath601 so that the gauge theory is an abelian theory  the case @xmath602 will simply be given by @xmath326 copies of the @xmath601 case .",
    "the fields @xmath597 have various charges under the @xmath603 gauge group . setting the @xmath379terms of the gauge theory to zero and dividing by the gauge group is , as we have discussed already in a different context in this paper , a khler quotient construction , and the result is a toric variety ( an overall @xmath25 decouples and is physically the centre of mass @xmath25 of the d3branes ) .",
    "however , to get the vacuum of the theory one must also set the @xmath225terms to zero , which means extremising the superpotential : @xmath604=0 .",

    "the metric is particularly simple @xcite : s^2 = ( _ 1 ^ 2 + ^2_1_1 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2 + ^2_2 _ 2 ^ 2 ) + ( + _ 1_1 + _",
    "2_2)^2  .here @xmath613 , @xmath137 , are usual polar and axial coordinates on two round two  spheres , and @xmath114 is a coordinate on a principle @xmath25 bundle over @xmath91 .",
    "here @xmath114 has period @xmath570 so that the chern numbers over the two two  spheres are both equal to one to have period @xmath153 yielding @xmath93 which is a also sasaki  einstein _ manifold_. in fact , this is the horizon manifold of the complex cone over @xmath614 .",
    "note that one must be careful to ensure that the killing spinors are well  defined on making such identifications . ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath615 is the reeb vector so that this is a regular sasaki  einstein manifold  the base khler ",
    "einstein manifold is just @xmath44 .",
    "the symplectic form on the metric cone is = r^2 ( _ 1_1_1 + _",
    "2_2_2 ) - rr ( + _ 1_1+_2_2 )  .",
    "clearly we have three commuting hamiltonian @xmath25s generated by @xmath616 , @xmath137 , and @xmath277 . as in the main text",
    ", one must be careful to ensure that one picks a basis for an effectively acting @xmath57 action when computing the moment map .",
    "if one fixes @xmath617 on the first two  sphere , one obtains a copy of @xmath280 , written as a principle @xmath25 bundle over the second two  sphere .",
    "the effectively acting isometry group on this squashed @xmath280 is @xmath300 , as discussed in the main text . defining @xmath618 , so",
    "that @xmath619 has canonical period @xmath153 , one can therefore take the following basis for the @xmath57 action : [ conbas ] e_1 & = & + + e_2 & = & + + e_3 & = &  .the corresponding moment map , homogeneous under rescaling of the cone , is now easily computed to be = ( r^2(_1 + 1 ) , r^2 ( _ 2 + 1 ) , r^2 )  .the image of the moment map @xmath620 is a convex rational polyhedral cone generated by the four edge vectors : ( nn ) & = & ( 1,1,1 ) + ( ns ) & = & ( 1,0,1 ) + ( sn ) & = & ( 0,1,1 ) + ( ss ) & = & ( 0,0,1 )  .",
    "that is , the subspaces over which a @xmath217 collapses are precisely the four subspaces @xmath621 , @xmath622 , @xmath623 , @xmath624  these are all copies of the fibre circle over the corresponding point on the base @xmath91 .",
    "the outward pointing primitive normal vectors to the cone are computed to be v_1 = [ 1,0,-1 ] , v_2 = [ 0,1,-1 ] , v_3 = [ 0,-1,0 ] , v_4 = [ -1,0,0 ]  .notice that these indeed form a good cone , as defined in the main text . also notice that the vectors @xmath258 span @xmath341 over @xmath235 .",
    "lerman s theorem then states that the base of the metric cone is simply  connected , which is of course correct .",
    "moreover , the fact that there are four facets means that @xmath625 , again correct .",
    "we may now apply the delzant theorem .",
    "the kernel is trivially calculated to be @xmath626 .",
    "thus the theorem gives a @xmath25 gauged linear sigma model on @xmath59 with charges @xmath626  this is of course well  known to give the conifold .",
    "turning on the fi parameter @xmath521 , @xmath627 gives the two small resolutions of the conifold , related by the flop transition .        ) to the torus @xmath57 of symmetries .",
    "the normal vectors now read v^_1 = [ -1,1,1 ] , v^_2 = [ -1,0,1 ] , v^_3 = [ -1,1,0 ] , v^_4 = [ -1,0,0 ]  .these all lie in the plane at @xmath628 . dropping this gives vectors in @xmath63 : _ 1 = [ 1,1 ] , _ 2 = [ 0,1 ] , _ 3 = [ 1,0 ] , _ 4 = [ 0,0 ]  .",
    "the toric diagram may thus be embedded in the orbifold @xmath629 and is presented below .        a singular space  the conifold .",
    "defining gauge invariant coordinates @xmath630 , @xmath631 , @xmath632 , @xmath633 we have precisely one relation @xmath634 in @xmath59 , which is thus an equivalent definition of the conifold .    at @xmath437",
    "we have a copy of @xmath449 , of size @xmath408 . on a patch in which @xmath466 we may introduce a gauge invariant complex coordinate @xmath439 .",
    "this patch covers a neighbourhood of the south pole at @xmath447 .",
    "similarly the coordinate @xmath440 covers a neighbourhood of the north pole at @xmath635 . over the intersection of the patches we have the relation @xmath636 , thus making the riemann sphere .",
    "let us now turn to the remaining coordinates .",
    "consider the subspace in which @xmath466 and introduce gauge invariant coordinates @xmath637 , @xmath638 .",
    "thus , over the open set @xmath639 , our subspace looks like a trivial rank two bundle @xmath640 .",
    "similarly , over @xmath641 we also have @xmath642 , where the fibre is coordinatised by @xmath643 , @xmath644 . on the overlap @xmath645",
    "we have the relation @xmath646 , @xmath647 . by definition",
    ", this gluing gives the bundle @xmath648 , which is the resolved conifold .",
    "the boundary , or horizon , of this manifold is an @xmath280 bundle over @xmath449 , since @xmath280 is the boundary of @xmath402 .",
    "there are various ways of seeing the topology of the horizon .",
    "one way is to projectivise the original bundle . recall that to projectivise a rank two complex vector bundle , with transition functions in @xmath300 , means that one replaces each @xmath402 fibre with @xmath416 , and glues the fibres together across overlaps using the induced transition functions , which lie in @xmath464 .",
    "here @xmath119 acts on the @xmath449 fibre in the usual way .",
    "since the transition functions of @xmath648 are diagonal , the projectivisation is just the product @xmath649 .",
    "the @xmath25 factor we projected out has unit winding over the fibre @xmath77 , since @xmath403 is the hopf map which has chern number 1 .",
    "the winding is also @xmath90 over the base since we began with the sum of two copies of @xmath554 .",
    "thus we see explicitly the topology of @xmath21 as the horizon manifold .",
