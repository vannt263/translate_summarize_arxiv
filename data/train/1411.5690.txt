    "hi 21 cm  absorption studies have long been used to study neutral hydrogen ( hi ) in both galaxies fortuitously located along the line of sight to background radio - loud quasars and gas associated with active galactic nuclei . in the case of absorption - selected galaxies at high redshifts , the damped lyman-@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ;",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early hi 21 cm  absorption studies of high - redshift dlas suggested that conditions in the neutral interstellar medium in these galaxies were different from those in the milky way .",
    "the few high-@xmath11 dlas with hi 21 cm  absorption studies were found to have relatively high spin temperatures ( @xmath13  k ) , nearly five times higher than typical values in the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , the poor low - frequency coverage of radio telescopes meant that such studies were only possible in a handful of dlas at @xmath14 . to make matters worse ,",
    "few dlas were known at low redshifts , due to which there were also hardly any @xmath15 measurements in dlas at @xmath16 .",
    "the situation has changed significantly over the last decade , with the advent of the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) which combine high sensitivity with excellent low - frequency radio coverage .",
    "there are now more than 50  dlas at all redshifts with hi 21 cm  absorption studies , nearly 40  of which have estimates of the spin temperature after correcting for the absorber covering factor ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "targeted lyman-@xmath0 spectroscopy of strong mgii  @xmath172796  absorbers @xcite and radio - loud quasars @xcite have yielded new samples of dlas at all redshifts for follow - up hi 21 cm  absorption studies .",
    "conversely , more than twenty - five redshifted hi 21 cm  absorbers at @xmath18 have been identified from direct spectroscopy of strong mgii  @xmath172796  absorbers ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "follow - up lyman-@xmath0 spectroscopy of some of these systems has provided estimates of the hi  column density , and hence , of the absorber spin temperature @xcite .",
    "finally , high - resolution optical spectroscopy of systems with hi 21 cm  absorption studies have been used to infer their gas - phase metallicities , dust depletions , etc , for comparison with the measured spin temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the above studies , it is now apparent that the spin temperature distribution in dlas is significantly different from that in the milky way , with dlas having typically higher spin temperatures @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation detected between spin temperatures and metallicities in dlas indicates that their high @xmath15 values arise due to larger fractions of the warm phase of neutral hydrogen in the absorbers , probably due to fewer radiative cooling routes at their typically - low metallicities @xcite .",
    "dla spin temperatures also show redshift evolution : absorbers at @xmath19 have both fewer detections of hi 21 cm  absorption and higher spin temperatures than systems at @xmath20 , again due to their smaller cold gas fractions @xcite .",
    "despite the recent progress in the field , an important lacuna remains the paucity of _ detections _ of hi 21 cm  absorption at high redshifts , @xmath14 .",
    "there are , at present , only seven detections of hi 21 cm  absorption in dlas at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "while hi 21 cm  non - detections provide lower limits to @xmath15 , which are useful in testing its redshift evolution , a detailed understanding of the evolution of the spin temperature and its relation with quantities like metallicity , dust depletion and star formation rate , as well as modeling of local physical conditions in the gas , critically require detections of hi 21 cm  absorption .",
    "hi 21 cm  line detections at high redshifts are also needed to use the lines in conjunction with ultraviolet resonance lines to probe the possibility of fundamental constant evolution @xcite . until now",
    ", the gbt has been the only telescope providing wide frequency coverage below 1  ghz ; unfortunately , the gbt is a single dish and hence more susceptible to the terrestrial interference that is common at these low radio frequencies .",
    "i report here two new detections of redshifted hi 21 cm  absorption at @xmath1 , first results from new wide - band @xmath2  mhz receivers that are currently being installed on the gmrt .",
    "the gmrt is presently being upgraded with a new suite of receivers that will give the telescope near - seamless coverage between 120  mhz and 1437  mhz . as part of this upgrade ,",
    "the present 327  mhz receivers ( which covers @xmath21  mhz ) are being replaced by wide - band cone - dipole receivers covering @xmath22  mhz , and with higher sensitivity than that of the earlier p - band system @xcite .",
    "the initial commissioning tests of the new receivers yielded tentative detections of redshifted hi 21 cm  absorption in two dlas at @xmath23 towards txs1755 + 578 and @xmath7 towards txs1850 + 402 @xcite .",
    "these two dlas were hence re - observed in july  2013 to confirm the detections of hi 21 cm  absorption .",
    "the gmrt observations of the two @xmath1 dlas were carried out on 2013 , july  31 , using the eleven antennas equipped with the new cone - dipole receivers , and the gmrt software backend .",
    "bandwidths of 1.04  mhz ( txs1850 + 402 ) and 4.17  mhz ( txs1755 + 578 ) were used for the observations , sub - divided into 512 channels , and centred at the redshifted hi 21 cm  line frequency ( 478.28  mhz for txs1755 + 578 and 475.24  mhz for txs1850 + 402 ) .",
    "observations of 3c286 and 3c48 were used to calibrate the flux density scale , and of 3c380 to calibrate the antenna bandpasses and initial antenna gains .",
    "the total on - source time was 3.5  hours for each source .",
    "the gmrt data were analysed in `` classic '' aips , using standard procedures .",
    "after initial data editing and calibration of the antenna gains and bandpasses , about 50  channels on each target source were averaged into a `` channel-0 '' dataset .",
    "a standard self - calibration procedure was then used to obtain the antenna gains , with a few rounds of phase - only self - calibration and 3-d imaging , followed by amplitude - and - phase self - calibration , 3-d imaging and data editing .",
    "this procedure was continued until the image did not improve on further self - calibration , and no evidence was found for bad data . in both cases ,",
    "the target source was the strongest source in the field , with flux densities ( measured using jmfit ) of @xmath24  mjy ( txs1755 + 578 ) and @xmath25  mjy ( txs1850 + 402 ) . neither source showed evidence of extended emission in the gmrt images .",
    "the final image was then subtracted from the calibrated spectral - line visibilities using the task uvsub , and uvlin then used to subtract any residual emission via a linear fit to each visibility spectrum .",
    "finally , cvel was used to shift the residual visibilities to the heliocentric frame .",
    "the data were then imaged and a spectrum obtained by taking a cut through the spectral cube at the location of the target sources .",
    "the final gmrt spectra towards txs1755 + 578 and txs1850 + 402 are shown in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spc ] , with optical depth plotted versus heliocentric frequency .",
    "the spectrum towards txs1850 + 402 has been hanning - smoothed and re - sampled , and has a velocity resolution of @xmath26  kms@xmath4 , while that towards txs1755 + 578 has been further boxcar - smoothed by 3  channels and re - sampled , and has a velocity resolution of @xmath27  kms@xmath4 .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) optical depth noise values on the original hanning - smoothed and re - sampled spectra are 0.011 per 4.1  khz channel ( txs1850 + 402 ) and 0.0092 per 16.3  khz channel ( txs1755 + 578 ) ; note that significantly more data were edited out for the latter source , due to intermittent radio frequency interference .",
    "both spectra show evidence of hi 21 cm  absorption , with integrated hi 21 cm  optical depths of @xmath28  kms@xmath4  ( txs1850 + 402 ) and @xmath3  kms@xmath4(txs1755 + 578 ) .",
    "note that the hi 21 cm  absorption towards txs1755 + 578 is relatively weak , and extends across only two independent @xmath29  kms@xmath4  channels .",

    "are related by the equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath38 where @xmath36 is the absorber covering factor , giving the fraction of the background radio emission that is occulted by the foreground dla .",
    "the covering factor can be estimated from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations at or near the redshifted hi 21 cm  line frequency to determine the fraction of flux density in the compact radio core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that a critical assumption in the above equation is that the hi  column density measured along the optical sightline is the same as that along the radio sightline .",
    "the hi  column densities of the dlas towards txs1755 + 578 and txs1850 + 402 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "equation  [ eqn : tspin ] then yields @xmath41 ( txs1755 + 578 ) and @xmath42  k ( txs1850 + 402 ) .",
    "the above results are summarized in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "unfortunately , there are at present , no low - frequency vlbi observations of txs1755 + 578 and txs1850 + 402 from which one might directly measure the fraction of flux density in the radio core . however , the two sources have either inverted ( txs1755 + 578 ) or flat ( txs1850 + 402 ) spectra at low frequencies ; such spectra typically arise due to synchrotron self - absorption , indicating that the radio emission is very compact .",
    "one hence would expect a relatively high core fraction in both sources . in the case of txs1850 + 402 ,",
    "vlbi observations have found all the 5  ghz emission to arise from two components both lying in a region smaller than @xmath43  mas @xcite . in combination with the flat spectrum of txs1850 + 402 ,",
    "this suggests that the covering fraction is likely to be close to unity at low frequencies .",
    "conversely , 5  ghz vlbi studies of txs1755 + 578 have shown that the source has multiple components extended over 30  mas , with a core flux density of @xmath44  mjy and a total flux density of @xmath45  mjy in the vlbi image @xcite ; this suggests a core fraction of @xmath46 . including these in the spin temperature estimates yields @xmath47  k ( txs1755 + 578 ) and @xmath48  k ( txs1850 + 402 ) , assuming that the hi 21 cm  absorption towards txs1755 + 578 arises towards the radio core .",
    "both absorbers thus appear to have relatively low @xmath15 values , significantly lower than the typical spin temperatures of high redshift dlas ( @xmath13  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "low - frequency vlbi imaging of the two dlas will be of much interest to directly estimate the core fraction close to the redshifted hi 21 cm  line frequencies .",
    "it should be emphasized that it is possible that the detected hi 21 cm  absorption towards txs1755 + 578 arises towards one of the four jet components , and not towards the radio core .",
    "this can not be ruled out , given the weakness of the hi 21 cm  absorption as well as the relative weakness of the core compared to the jet components .",
    "further , the core is likely to have a strongly inverted spectrum and is hence likely to be even weaker relatively to the jet components at low frequencies .",
    "it is hence plausible that the radio and optical sightlines are not the same for txs1755 + 578 ( see below ) .",
    "caution should hence be exercised while interpreting the results towards this source , in the absence of vlbi observations in the redshifted hi 21 cm  line .",
    "both dlas are known to show strong metal - line absorption in their optical spectra , with multiple absorption components @xcite . for txs1850 + 402 ,",
    "the redshifts of the two strongest metal - line components are in reasonable agreement with the two hi 21 cm  absorption components .",
    "these components are likely to be arise in cold gas , which gives rise to the hi 21 cm  absorption ; the other metal - line components are likely to originate in warmer gas .",
    "conversely , in the case of txs1755 + 578 , @xcite found eight ci  absorption components in their keck - hires spectrum , as well as sii *   absorption . since ci  absorption is expected to arise in cold gas , it may be surprising that the hi 21 cm  absorption profile towards txs1755 + 578 shows only a single absorption component , which is itself offset in velocity from the stronger ci  lines .",
    "this too suggests that radio core in txs1755 + 578 may be extremely weak at low frequencies , with the hi 21 cm  absorption arising towards one of the components in the radio jet . as such",
    ", one should not use the hi  column density determined towards the optical qso with the hi 21 cm  optical depth to estimate the absorber spin temperature .",
    "finally , the dla towards txs1850 + 402 has a relatively high metallicity , [ zn / h ]  @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "its low @xmath15 value is thus consistent with the anti - correlation between metallicity and spin temperature that has been found in dlas @xcite .",
    "the dla towards txs1755 + 578 has an even higher metallicity , [ zn / h ]  @xmath50 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jorgenson et al . , in prep . )",
    "while this too is consistent with a large cold gas fraction and hence a low dla spin temperature , the likely difference between the radio and optical sightlines in this absorber implies that one can not test the anti - correlation between metallicity and spin temperature here .    in summary ,",
    "i report the detection of redshifted hi 21 cm  absorption in two dlas at @xmath1 towards txs1755 + 578 and txs1850 + 402 with a new wide - band gmrt receiver that covers @xmath2  mhz , with integrated hi 21 cm  optical depths of @xmath51  kms@xmath4   ( txs1755 + 578 ) and @xmath52  kms@xmath4  ( txs1850 + 402 ) .",
    "these are only the eighth and ninth detections of hi 21 cm  absorption in dlas at @xmath14",
    ". for the @xmath53 dla towards txs1850 + 402 , the compact nature of the background source ( with size @xmath43  mas at 5  ghz ) suggests that the low - frequency covering factor is close to unity . combining the hi  column density measured from the lyman-@xmath0 line with the hi 21 cm  optical depth",
    "then yields a spin temperature @xmath54  k. this low @xmath15 value and the relatively high dla metallicity are consistent with the anti - correlation between the two quantities that has been earlier found in dlas . in the case of the @xmath23 absorber towards txs1755 + 578 , the weakness of the radio core and the fact that the profiles in the hi 21 cm  and ci  lines are very different suggest that the radio and optical absorption arise from different sightlines , and hence , that one should not attempt to combine the two to infer a spin temperature .",
    "the detection of two new hi 21 cm  absorbers in the commissioning phase of the new wide - band gmrt receivers , and with only one - third the collecting area of the full gmrt , indicate that both the number of detections of hi 21 cm  absorption and our understanding of physical conditions in the neutral gas in high-@xmath11 dlas are likely to improve significantly in the next few years .",
