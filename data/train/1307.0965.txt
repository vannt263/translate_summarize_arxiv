    "the developments in neutrino physics in recent 15 years have been overwhelmingly fast .",
    "nonzero neutrino mass has been established and five out of nine neutrino mass parameters have been measured with remarkable precision . in 2012 , at last the relatively small mixing angle , @xmath0 was measured @xcite .",
    "this nonzero value of @xmath0 opens up the possibility of having cp - violating effects in the neutrino oscillations ; _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath6 . with this nonzero value of @xmath0",
    ", the quest for measuring the dirac cp - violating phase , @xmath7 , has been gathering momentum .",
    "a well - studied way to extract @xmath7 is the precision measurement and comparison of @xmath8 and @xmath9 by superbeam and neutrino factory facilities @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the only way .",
    "in fact by studying the energy dependence of just one appearance mode _",
    "@xmath8 , the value of @xmath10 can be extracted @xcite . in @xcite , a novel method for extracting @xmath7 ( or more precisely @xmath11 )",
    "was suggested that was based on reconstructing the unitary triangle in the lepton sector .",
    "the idea of reconstructing the unitary triangle in the lepton sector has been later on studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , beta beam facilities producing @xmath12 or @xmath13 beams from the decay of relativistic ions @xcite have been proposed and studied as an alternative machine to establish cp - violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "most studies were however performed before the measurement of @xmath0 , with a focus on the cp - discovery reach for values of @xmath0 much smaller than the measured one @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that using the @xmath12 beam from @xmath14ne decay with energies peaked around 1.5 - 2 gev , information on @xmath7 can be extracted without a need for an antineutrino beam . in this setup , the boost factor of the decaying ions is @xmath15 . in the present work",
    ", we shall consider a similar setup ; however , with lower boost factors yielding neutrino energies below the 13-resonance energy in the mantle which is about 6.5 gev @xcite .",
    "for a detailed analysis of the matter effects see @xcite . for a neutrino beam with a given energy in the range 400  mev@xmath161.5  gev ,",
    "the oscillation probability can be approximately written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cosine of the 12-mixing angle in matter and @xmath19 are the phases resulting from the propagation ; _ i.e. , _ for a constant density @xmath20 .",
    "for the antineutrino mode , a similar equation holds with @xmath21 and @xmath22 notice that in the above formulas , the deviations of the values of @xmath23 and @xmath7 in matter from those in vacuum are neglected .",
    "these deviations are of order of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath25 , the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ pemu ] ) as well as those in eq .",
    "( [ pbaremu ] ) are of the same order so the interference terms which are sensitive to @xmath7 are of order of the oscillation probabilities themselves .",
    "this means that the variation in the oscillation probabilities due to the change of @xmath7 within @xmath26 is of order of the oscillation probabilities , themselves . as a result for these energies and @xmath25 ,",
    "even a moderate precision in the measurement of the probabilities will be enough to extract the value of @xmath7 .",
    "the flux at the detector scales as @xmath27 and the scattering cross section of neutrinos increases by increasing the energy ( _ i.e. , _ increasing @xmath28 ) . as a result , for a given baseline ,",
    "the statistics increases with @xmath28 .",
    "based on this observation , most attention in the recent years has been given to @xmath29 .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that for @xmath30 , there is the advantage of using very large water cherenkov ( wc ) detectors . in this energy range",
    ", the neutrino interaction will be dominantly quasi - elastic and its scattering cross section is known with high precision . in the literature ,",
    "the cp - discovery potential of a beta beam setup from cern to frejus with @xmath31 and @xmath32  km has been investigated @xcite .",
    "moreover , varying the values of @xmath28 and baselines , it has been shown that for @xmath33 with 500 kton wc detector @xcite or iron calorimeter @xcite , there is a very good chance of cp - discovery .",
    "@xcite explores the @xmath34 discovery reach with a 300 kton wc and 50 kton lar detector at deep underground science and engineering laboratory ( dusel ) , taking maximum boosts possible at tevatron .",
    "now that the value of @xmath0 is measured and found to be sizeable , reconsidering @xmath30 setup is imperative . in vacuum",
    ", the dependence of the oscillation probability on @xmath35 and @xmath28 would be through @xmath36 .",
    "however , for setups under consideration , because of the matter effects , the dependence on @xmath35 and @xmath37 is more sophisticated so the dependence on @xmath38 and @xmath35 has to be investigated separately . in particular , while ref .",
    "@xcite focuses on @xmath39  km , we have found that for @xmath40  km , there is a very good discovery potential .",
    "the present paper is devoted to such a study .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the inputs and how we carry out the analysis .",
    "we outline the characteristics of the beam and the detector as well as the sources of the background and the systematic errors . in section iii ,",
    "we present our results and analyze them . in section iv , we summarize our conclusions and propose an optimal setup for the @xmath7 measurement .",
    "using the globes software @xcite , we investigate the cp - discovery potential of a beta beam setup with various baselines and beam boost factors , @xmath28 . for the central values of the neutrino parameters",
    ", we have taken the latest values in ref @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy can be determined by other experiments such as pingu @xcite or combining pingu and daya bay ii results @xcite",
    "so we assume that hierarchy is known by the time that such a beta beam setup is ready .",
    "we study both normal and inverted hierarchies .",
    "t2k and nova can also solve the octant degeneracy and determine whether @xmath41 or @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the data already excludes the @xmath42 solution at 1 @xmath43 c.l . for the uncertainty of the mixing parameters , we take the values that will be achievable by forthcoming experiments .",
    "namely , we take the following uncertainties : 0.4% for @xmath44 @xcite , 1.8% for @xmath0 @xcite , 2% for @xmath23 @xcite , 0.2% for @xmath45 @xcite and 0.7% for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "as predefined by globes , we use the matter profiles in @xcite .",
    "we consider 5% error for matter density .",
    "the uncertainties are treated by the so - called pull - method @xcite . while the effects of uncertainty in matter density is more important for larger baselines , the uncertainties of neutrino parameters affect the results from smaller baselines more .    as the source of neutrino ( antineutrino ) beam , we take decays of @xmath14ne ( @xmath2he ) : @xmath47 and @xmath48 the endpoint energies of these two decays are very close to each other : @xmath49  mev for @xmath14ne and @xmath50  mev for @xmath51he . as a result for equal @xmath28 ,",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath12 and @xmath13 from their decays will be approximately similar .",
    "the pair of @xmath52li and @xmath52b isotopes have also been discussed in the literature as a potential source of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 beams . in these cases ,",
    "the endpoints are higher so to have neutrino beams with energies @xmath53 gev , the values of @xmath28 should be lower than in the case of @xmath14ne/@xmath51he .",
    "on the other hand , the flux at the detector drops as @xmath54 so with the @xmath52li and @xmath52b isotopes , the number of decays should be larger to compensate for the @xmath54 suppression .",
    "we will not consider the @xmath52li/@xmath52b isotopes in this paper and will focus on the @xmath14ne/@xmath51he pair .",
    "for neutrino ( antineutrino ) mode , we take @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) decays of @xmath14ne ( @xmath2he ) per year which seems to be realistic @xcite .",
    "tevatron accelerator can accelerate @xmath14ne and @xmath2he up to boost factors 586 and 351 , respectively .    while the disappearance probabilities ( i.e. , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) are not sensitive to @xmath7 , appearance probabilities ( i.e. , @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) contain information on @xmath7 . in our analysis",
    ", we however employ both appearance and disappearance modes . in principle , the disappearance mode can help to reduce the effect of uncertainty in other parameters but we have found that the effect of turning off the disappearance mode on the @xmath7 measurement is less than 1 % . to derive the value of @xmath7 , the detector has to distinguish @xmath61 from @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on a 500 kton water cherenkov ( wc ) detector and compare its performance with a 50 kton totaly active scintillator detector ( tasd ) .    in the energies of our interest with @xmath30 ,",
    "the main interaction mode is charged current ( cc ) quasi - elastic mode with a non - negligible contribution from inelastic charged current interaction which produce one or more pions along with the charged lepton . in principle , the quasi - elastic cc events can be distinguished from the inelastic cc ones by counting the number of cherenkov rings .",
    "however with a wc detector distinguishing the two interactions will be challenging .",
    "we take the signal to be composed of both quasi - elastic and inelastic charged current events and conservatively assume wc detector can not distinguish between the two .    in the case of qe interaction by measuring the energy and the direction of the final charged lepton",
    ", the energy of the initial neutrino can be reconstructed up to an uncertainty of 0.085  gev caused by the fermi motion of nucleons inside the nucleus . however , in the inelastic interaction , a fraction of the initial energy is carried by pions so the energy of the initial neutrino can not be reconstructed by measuring the energy and the direction of the final lepton alone . a wc detector can not measure the energy deposited in hadronic showers so with this technique , the reconstruction of the energy spectrum will be possible only for the qe interactions . following the technique in @xcite",
    "we take an unknown normalization for qe events and use its spectrum as a basis for energy reconstruction .",
    "of course with this method , energy reconstruction can not be carried out on an event by event basis and information on the spectrum will be only statistical .",
    "tasd can measure the energy deposited in hadronic showers , too . as a result ,",
    "energy reconstruction by tasd can be possible on an event by event basis .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the background from atmospheric neutrinos can be neglected and the main source of background for both tasd and wc detectors are neutral current interactions of the beam neutrinos . in our analysis , the cross sections of the quasi - elastic , inelastic and neutral current interactions we employ the results of @xcite .",
    "recently the miniboone collaboration has measured the antineutrino cross section in the energy range of our interest @xcite with remarkable precision . in the near future , the measurement of cross section will become even more precise . unless otherwise stated , we assume four years of data taking .    for the treatment of the efficiencies and backgrounds we implement the same methods used in @xcite .",
    "while for the purpose of this paper , the methods used in @xcite are adequate , we would like to note that a more complete discussion of reconstruction of events in large wc detectors can be found in @xcite . to be more specific similarly to @xcite",
    ", we assume the following characteristics for the wc detector performance .",
    "we take a signal efficiency of 55% for neutrinos and that of 75% for antineutrinos .",
    "we take the uncertainty in normalization of the total signal to be 2.5 % but as we mentioned above , we take a free normalization for qe events .",
    "we assume a background rejection of 0.3 % for neutrinos and 0.25 % for antineutrinos .",
    "the normalization uncertainty of the background is taken to be 5 % .",
    "for both background and signal , the calibration error is 0.0001 . for the energy reconstruction of the background ,",
    "we use the migration matrices tabulated for the globes package @xcite .",
    "we consider the energy range between 0.2 and 3 gev and divide it into 28 bins .",
    "the energy resolution for qe cc interactions is assumed to be of form @xmath62  gev for both muon and electron neutrino detection .",
    "the first term originates from the fermi motion of the nuleons inside nuclei and the second term reflects the error in measuring the energy of the final charged lepton @xcite .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume the following features for tasd : a signal efficiency of 80% for @xmath61 and @xmath63 and that of 20% for @xmath12 and @xmath64 ; background rejection of 0.1 % ; a signal normalization uncertainty of 2.5% ; normalization uncertainty of 5% ; a calibration error of 0.0001 .",
    "the energy resolution is given by @xmath65  gev for muon ( anti)neutrinos and @xmath66 gev for electron ( anti)neutrinos .",
    "the energy range is taken from 0.5 gev to 3.5 gev and divided to 20 bins .",
    "we have studied the dependence of our results on the number of the bins .",
    "it seems that the results do not change by increasing the number of the bins to 30 .",
    "in figs [ l - dd ] and [ nu - and - antinu - dd ] , the vertical axis shows the precision with which @xmath67 can be determined at 1 @xmath43 % c.l .",
    "we take @xmath67 and define @xmath68 the range for which @xmath69 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath68 is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum values of @xmath7 around @xmath67 for which @xmath70 . from fig [ l - dd ]",
    ", we observe that low energy set - up with @xmath71 and wc detector can outperform the setup with @xmath15 and tasd detector for both normal and inverted hierarchies .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the curves is driven by the 13-splitting and has a frequency given by @xmath72 .",
    "such a behavior can be understood by the following consideration on eqs .",
    "( [ pemu],[pbaremu ] ) : while @xmath73 is driven by @xmath74 and slowly varies with @xmath35 , @xmath75 is driven by @xmath76 and varies rapidly .",
    "for the values of @xmath35 that @xmath77 , the sensitivity is lost .",
    "this consideration explains the oscillatory behavior of figs .",
    "[ l - dd ] .",
    "notice , however that this consideration holds for a given @xmath78 . if the energy spectrum is wide , the effect will smear out . in other words , if the number of energy bins from which information on @xmath7 can be deduced ( _ i.e. , _ the bins for which the number of events without oscillation is sizeable and the quasi - elastic interactions dominate ) is relatively large , missing information in few of these bins for which @xmath79 will not affect much the precision in the determination of @xmath7 . in the opposite case",
    "when at all such bins @xmath80 , the precision in @xmath7 will be dramatically deteriorated .",
    "increasing the boost factor increases both the peak energy and the energy width .",
    "thus , we expect for higher @xmath28 , the oscillatory behavior to be smeared out .",
    "[ l - dd ] confirm this expectation . in case of antineutrinos",
    ", the information on @xmath7 can be deduced from a larger range of spectrum mainly because of the shape of the spectrum at the source and the fact that for antineutrinos , the qe interactions dominate over inelastic interaction for a wider energy range compared to the case of neutrino @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the modulation driven by @xmath81 is less severe for antineutrinos . as seen in the lower panels of fig 1",
