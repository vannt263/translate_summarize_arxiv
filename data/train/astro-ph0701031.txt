    ", one can also define and determine the number of pulses in the grb s light - curve and their widths , rise - times , and ` lag - times ' .",
    "finally , with considerable toil and embarrassment of choices , one can define and measure ` variability ' ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz , 2000 ; plaga , 2001 ; reichart et al .",
    "2001 ; guidorzi et al .",
    "2006 ; schaefer 2006 ) .",
    "pairs of the above quantities are known to be correlated as approximate power laws , sometimes fairly tightly and over spans of several orders of magnitude .",
    "a model of grbs ought to be able to predict these power laws and to pin - point the choices of red - shift corrections that should make them tightest .    in the ` cannonball ' ( cb ) model of grbs the correlations between the cited observables , as we shall discuss ,",
    "are predictable .",
    "they are based on very simple physics : the production of @xmath0 rays by inverse compton scattering of much softer photons by a relativistically - moving , quasi - point - like object ( shaviv & dar 1995 , dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",
    "the correlations very satisfactorily test these individual theoretical ingredients , or combinations thereof .",
    "a reader desiring to start by evaluating these claims may choose to read section [ basis ] first .",
    "the data , particularly on grbs of known red - shift , has become much more extensive in the time elapsed since the cb - model correlations were predicted ( dar & de rjula 2001 ) and several of them were tested ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",
    "it is time to restudy the subject , which we do for many correlations , relying mainly on the data analysis by schaefer ( 2006 ) .",
    "in the cb model ( dar & de rjula  2000 , 2004 ; dado et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of cbs , ejected in core - collapse sn explosions ( dar & plaga  1999 ) . an accretion disk is hypothesized to be produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( de rjula  1987 ) . as observed in microquasars , each time part of the disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , a pair of cbs made of _ ordinary plasma _ are emitted with high bulk - motion lorentz factors , @xmath0 , in opposite directions along the rotation axis , wherefrom matter has already fallen onto the compact object , due to lack of rotational support .",
    "the @xmath0-rays of a single pulse in a grb are produced as a cb coasts through the sn _ glory _ the sn light scattered away from the radial direction by the sn and pre - sn ejecta .",
    "the electrons enclosed in the cb compton up - scatter glory s photons to grb energies .",
    "each pulse of a grb corresponds to one cb .",
    "the emission times of the individual cbs reflect the chaotic accretion process and are not predictable . at the moment , neither are the characteristic baryon number and lorentz factor of cbs , which can be inferred from the analysis of grb afterglows ( dado et al .",
    "2002 , 2003a ) . given this information ,",
    "two other ` priors ' ( the typical early luminosity of a supernova and the typical density distribution of the parent star s wind - fed circumburst material ) , and a single extra hypothesis ( that the wind s column density in the ` polar ' directions is significantly smaller than average ) all observed properties of the grb pulses can be derived ( dar & de rjula  2004 ) .",
    "all that is required are explicit simple calculations involving compton scattering .    strictly speaking , our results refer to single pulses in a grb , whose properties reflect those of _ one _ cb .",
    "the statistics on single - pulse grbs of known redshift are too meager to be significant .",
    "thus , we apply our results to entire grbs , irrespective of their number of pulses , which ranges from 1 to @xmath1 .",
    "this implies averaging the properties of a grb over its distinct pulses , and is no doubt a source of dispersion in the correlations we study .",
    "cannonballs are highly relativistic , their typical lorentz factors are @xmath2 .",
    "they are quasi - point - like : the angle a cb subtends from its point of emission is comparable or smaller than the characteristic opening angle , @xmath3 , of its relativistically beamed radiation .",
    "let the typical viewing angle of an observer of a cb , relative to its direction of motion , be @xmath4(1 mrad ) , and let @xmath5 be the corresponding doppler factor : @xmath6 where the approximation is excellent for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "to correlate two grb observables , all one needs to know is their functional dependence on @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that , in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath11 is so pronounced , that it may be expected to be the largest source of the case - to - case spread in the measured quantities ( for grbs of known redshift @xmath12 , the correlations are sharpened by use of the explicit @xmath12-dependences ) . in the cb model , the @xmath13 dependences of the spherical equivalent energy of a grb , @xmath14 ; its peak isotropic luminosity @xmath15 ; its peak energy , @xmath16 ( dar & de rjula 2001 ) ; and its pulse rise - time @xmath17 ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) , are : @xmath18 the first two of these results are simple consequences of relativity and the quasi - point - like character of the cb - model s sources ( they would be different for an assumed grb - generating jet with an opening angle much greater than @xmath19 ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath16 reflects the inverse compton scattering by the cb s electrons ( comoving with it with a lorentz factor @xmath0 ) of the glory s photons , that are approximately isotropic in the supernova rest system , and are doppler - shifted by the cb s motion by a factor @xmath9 ( the result would be different , for instance , for synchrotron radiation from the grb s source , or self - compton scattering of photons comoving with it ) .",

    "we derive the cb - model s expectation for the the variability of a grb , @xmath20 , and the prediction for the ` lag - time ' of its pulses , @xmath21 , to wit : @xmath22 the physics of the first of these relations is essentially the same as that of a pulse s rise - time .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath21 reflects the cb - model s specific prediction for how , as a pulse evolves in time , the photon s energy spectrum softens , due to the increasingly non - isotropic character of the glory s photons which the cbs encounter as they travel , and to the softening of the energy spectrum of the cb s electron population ( dar & de rjula 2004 ) .",

    "we consider first one of these subgroups : the 5 correlations most often phenomenologically discussed to date .",
