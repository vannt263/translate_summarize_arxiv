    "the elucidation of the universal scaling properties of equal - time and time - dependent correlation functions in the vicinity of a critical point was one of the most important achievements of statistical mechanics over the past forty years .",
    "the analogous systematization of the power laws and associated exponents that govern the behaviours of structure functions in a turbulent fluid , or in a passive - scalar advected by such a fluid , is a major challenge in the areas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , fluid mechanics , and nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the power - law behaviours of _ equal - time _ structure functions have been studied in detail over the past few decades @xcite ; and , especially in the case of passive - scalar turbulence @xcite , significant progress has been made in understanding the _ multiscaling _ of _ equal - time _ structure functions .",
    "the nature of multiscaling of _ time - dependent _ structure functions has been examined recently @xcite but only for the case of _ statistically steady _ turbulence .",
    "we develop here the systematics of the multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions for the case of _ decaying _ fluid and passive - scalar turbulence @xcite .    to set the stage for our discussion of time - dependent structure functions in turbulence ,",
    "it is useful to begin by recalling some well - known results from critical phenomena  @xcite : at a critical point for a spin system in @xmath0 dimensions , the equal - time , two - spin correlation function @xmath1 and its spatial fourier transform @xmath2 assume the following power - law scaling forms : @xmath3 here @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the temperature and the critical temperature , respectively , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the external field , @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , the spins are separated by the vector @xmath10 [ @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the wavevector , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are critical exponents , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are scaling functions . away from the critical point",
    "such correlation functions decay exponentially ; the associated correlation length @xmath19 diverges in the vicinity of the critical point ; e.g. , as @xmath20 , if @xmath21 .",
    "time - dependent correlation functions also assume scaling forms in the vicinity of the critical point and the characteristic relaxation time @xmath22 diverges as suggested by the _ dynamic - scaling ansatz _",
    "@xcite @xmath23 which introduces the _ dynamic - scaling exponent _ @xmath24 .",
    "the generalisation of such a dynamic - scaling _ ansatz _ to the case of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence is our prime concern here .",
    "the power - law behaviours of equal - time structure functions , in the inertial range ( to be defined later ) , in turbulence are reminiscent of the algebraic dependence on @xmath25 of critical - point correlation functions . however , there are important differences between the two that must be appreciated before we embark on a systematization of time - dependent structure functions in turbulence .",
    "we begin with the increments of the longitudinal component of the velocity @xmath26\\cdot({\\bf r}/r)$ ] and passive - scalar @xmath27 $ ] , respectively ; here @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote , respectively , the velocity of the fluid and the passive - scalar density at the point @xmath30 and time @xmath31 , and the subscript @xmath32 the longitudinal component .",
    "the order-@xmath33 , equal - time structure functions , for the fluid ( superscript @xmath34 ) and passive - scalar ( superscript @xmath35 ) fields , are defined as follows : @xmath36^p \\ra   \\sim r^{\\zeta^{u}_p } ; \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal s}^{\\theta}_p(r ) & \\equiv &                  \\la [ \\delta\\theta({\\bf x},{\\bf r},t)]^p \\ra   \\sim r^{\\zeta^{\\theta}_p } ; \\label{sp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the angular brackets indicate averages over the steady state for statistically steady turbulence or over statistically independent initial configurations for decaying turbulence ; for stochastic differential equations , like the kraichnan model ( @xmath37 ) , the angular brackets denote an average over the statistics of the noise ; and the power laws , characterised by the equal - time exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 , hold for separations @xmath25 in the inertial range @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the kolmogorov dissipation scale and @xmath42 the large length scale at which energy is injected into the system .",
    "kolmogorov s phenomenological theory @xcite of 1941 ( k41 ) suggests simple scaling , with @xmath43 , but experimental and numerical evidence favours equal - time multiscaling with @xmath38 and @xmath39 nonlinear , convex , monotone - increasing functions of @xmath33 . for the simplified kraichnan model @xcite of passive - scalar turbulence ( @xmath37 ) multiscaling of equal - time structure functions",
    "can be demonstrated analytically in certain limits .",
    "the analogue of the k41 theory for passive - scalar turbulence is due to obukhov and corrsin @xcite ; if the schmidt number @xmath44 , then their theory yields k41 exponents for the passive - scalar case ; here @xmath14 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath45 is the diffusivity of the passive scalar .    a straightforward extension of simple",
    ", k41 scaling to time - dependent structure functions implies that the dynamic exponents @xmath46 for all @xmath33 .",
    "this nave extension fails for two reasons : ( a ) it does not distinguish between the temporal behaviours of structure functions of eulerian , lagrangian , and quasi - lagrangian ( @xmath47 ) velocities or passive - scalar densities ; and ( b ) it does not account for the multiscaling of structure functions .",
    "these difficulties have been overcome to a large extent for statistically steady turbulence @xcite as we summarise below .",
    "there is consensus now that eulerian structure functions display simple scaling with only one dynamic - scaling exponent @xmath48 because of the _ sweeping effect _ : the mean flow , or the flow caused by the largest eddy , advects small eddies , so spatial separations @xmath25 in ( [ sp ] ) are related _ linearly _ to temporal separations @xmath22 via the mean - flow velocity @xcite . by contrast , it is expected that lagrangian @xcite or quasi - lagrangian @xcite time - dependent structure functions should show nontrivial dynamic multiscaling .",
    "the task of extracting well - averaged time - dependent lagrangian or quasi - lagrangian structure functions from a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equation is a daunting one @xcite : a dynamic exponent has been extracted from a full lagrangian study @xcite only for order @xmath49 .",
    "thus the elucidation of dynamic multiscaling has relied on predictions based on generalisations of the multifractal formalism @xcite and on numerical studies of shell models @xcite .",
    "these studies show that , if dynamic multiscaling exists , time - dependent structure functions must be characterised by an infinity of time scales and associated dynamic multiscaling exponents @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamic exponents depend on how we extract time scales from time - dependent structure functions ; e.g. , for fluid turbulence , time scales obtained from integrals ( superscript @xmath50 and subscript 1 ) and second derivatives ( superscript @xmath51 and subscript @xmath52 ) of order-@xmath33 time - dependent structure functions yield the _ different _ dynamic exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally , the different dynamic multiscaling exponents are related by _",
    "different classes of linear bridge relations _ to the equal - time multiscaling exponents . for a careful discussion of these issues",
    "we must of course define time - dependent structure functions .",
    "the details necessary for this paper are given in @xmath47 and @xmath55 .",
    "the dynamic multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions described briefly above applies to statistically steady turbulence .",
    "does it have an analogue in the case of decaying turbulence , since time - dependent structure functions must , in this case , depend on the origin of time @xmath56 at which we start our measurements ?",
    "this question has not been addressed hitherto .",
    "we show here how to answer it in decaying fluid and passive - scalar turbulence @xcite .",
    "in particular , we propose suitable normalisations of time - dependent structure functions that eliminate their dependence on @xmath56 ; we demonstrate this _ analytically _ for the kraichnan version of the passive - scalar problem and its shell - model analogue and _ numerically _ for the goy shell model @xcite for fluids and a shell - model version of the advection - diffusion equation . in these models",
    "we then analyse the normalised time - dependent structure functions for the case of decaying turbulence like their statistically steady counterparts @xcite .",
    "this requires a generalisation of the multifractal formalism @xcite that finally yields the same bridge relations between dynamic and equal - time multiscaling exponents as for statistically steady turbulence @xcite . for the kraichnan version of the passive - scalar problem",
    "we show analytically that simple dynamic scaling is obtained .",
    "this is because ( @xmath57 ) the advecting velocity is random and white in time .",
    "in addition , we find numerically for shell models of fluid and passive - scalar turbulence that dynamic - multiscaling exponents have the same values for both statistically steady and decaying turbulence ; so , in this sense , we have _ universality _ of the multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions in turbulence . the equal - time analogue of this universality has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath47",
    "we introduce the models we use and give the details of our numerical simulations .",
    "@xmath57 presents our analytical studies of decaying turbulence in the kraichnan model and its shell - model analogue .",
    "@xmath55 shows how to generalise the multifractal formalism to allow for time - dependent structure functions in decaying turbulence and how to obtain bridge relations between dynamic and equal - time multiscaling exponents in this case . in @xmath58",
    "we present the results of our numerical studies of dynamic multiscaling in the goy shell model for fluid turbulence and for shell models of a passive - scalar field advected by a turbulent velocity field .",
    "@xmath59 is devoted to a discussion of our results in the context of earlier studies ; we also suggest possible experimental tests of our predictions .",
    "we have used several models to study time - dependent structure functions in fluid and passive - scalar turbulence . these range from the navier - stokes and advection - diffusion equations to simple shell models ; the latter are well - suited for our extensive numerical studies .",
    "it is useful to begin with a systematic description of these models .",
    "fluid flows are governed by the navier - stokes ( ns ) equation ( [ ns1 ] ) for the velocity field @xmath28 at point @xmath30 and time @xmath31 , augmented by the incompressibility constraint ( [ ns2 ] ) , since we restrict ourselves to low mach numbers : @xmath60 @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath63 the pressure , the density @xmath64 is taken to be 1 , and @xmath65 the external force , which is absent when we consider decaying turbulence . if @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively , characteristic length and velocity scales of the flow , the reynolds number @xmath68 provides a dimensionless measure of the strength of the nonlinear term in ( [ ns1 ] ) relative to the viscous term ; for the case of decaying turbulence it is convenient to use the reynolds number for the initial state , i.e. , @xmath69 with @xmath67 the root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity of the initial condition and @xmath66 the system size [ the linear size of the simulation box in a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) ] . given the incompressibility condition ( [ ns2 ] ) , the pressure can be eliminated from ( [ ns1 ] ) and related to the velocity by a poisson equation .",
    "the equation for the velocity alone is most easily written in terms of the spatial fourier transform @xmath70 of @xmath28 ; and it can be shown easily that @xmath70 is affected _ directly _ by all other fourier modes .",
    "this is the mathematical representation of the sweeping effect in which the largest eddies ( i.e. , modes with small @xmath71 ) _ directly _ advect the smallest eddies ( i.e. , large-@xmath72 modes ) ; such direct sweeping lies at the heart of the taylor hypothesis @xcite and leads eventually to trivial dynamic scaling for time - dependent structure functions of eulerian fields with a dynamic exponent @xmath73 for fluid turbulence .",
    "as we have mentioned above , nontrivial dynamic multiscaling is expected if we use lagrangian or quasi - lagrangian velocities .",
    "the lagrangian formulation is well known @xcite ; the quasi - lagrangian @xcite one uses the following transformation for any eulerian field @xmath74 : @xmath75 , \\label{qltrans}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the quasi - lagrangian field and @xmath77 is the position at time @xmath31 of a lagrangian particle that was at point @xmath78 at time @xmath79 .    the advection - diffusion ( ad ) equation for the eulerian passive - scalar field @xmath29 is @xmath80 where @xmath45 is the passive - scalar diffusivity and , if we consider decaying passive - scalar turbulence , the external force @xmath81 is set to zero .",
    "the advecting velocity field @xmath82 should be obtained , in principle , by solving equations ( [ ns1 ] ) and ( [ ns2 ] ) . by using equation ( [ qltrans ] )",
    "we get the quasi - lagrangian version of the advection - diffusion equation ( [ nseqn ] ) : @xmath83.\\nabla { \\hat \\theta}({\\bf x},t )    = \\kappa \\nabla^2 { \\hat \\theta}({\\bf x},t ) +   { \\hat f}_{\\theta}({\\bf x},t ) .",

    "time - dependent lagrangian structure functions have been obtained @xcite only for order @xmath49 .",
    "thus a first - principles dns study of dynamic multiscaling in fluid or passive - scalar turbulence is not possible at the moment .",
    "however , significant progress has been made in statistically steady turbulence by studying dynamic multiscaling in simplified models like the kraichnan model for passive - scalar turbulence and shell models for fluid and passive - scalar turbulence .",
    "we discuss these models below since our studies of decaying turbulence will be based on them .",
    "the kraichnan model for passive - scalar turbulence @xcite begins with the advection - diffusion equation ( [ nseqn ] ) but replaces the navier - stokes velocity field by one in which each component @xmath84 of the velocity is a zero - mean , delta - correlated , gaussian random variable with the covariance @xmath85 the fourier transform of @xmath86 has the form @xmath87 , \\label{dij1}\\ ] ] where * q * is the wave vector , @xmath42 the characteristic large length scale , @xmath41 the dissipation scale , and @xmath88 a tunable parameter . in the limits @xmath89 and @xmath90 , of relevance to turbulence",

    "this model shows multiscaling of order-@xmath33 , equal - time passive - scalar structure functions , as can be shown analytically , in certain limits @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of statistically steady turbulence , this model exhibits simple dynamic scaling  @xcite .",
    "we will also use some shell models for fluid and passive - scalar turbulence .",
    "these models are highly simplified representations of the navier - stokes or the advection - diffusion equations ( [ ns1]-[nseqn ] ) and are , therefore , far more tractable numerically than ( [ ns1]-[nseqn ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , shell models retain enough properties of their parent equations to make them useful testing grounds for the multiscaling of structure functions in turbulence .",
    "shell models are defined on a logarithmically discretised fourier space in which complex scalar variables ( e.g. , the velocity @xmath97 or passive scalar @xmath98 ) are associated with the shells @xmath99 and scalar wave vectors @xmath100 ; typically @xmath101 ; and the boundary conditions are that the shell variables vanish if @xmath102 or @xmath103 ( we use @xmath104 ) .",
    "these models consist of coupled , nonlinear , ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that specify the temporal evolution of the shell variables @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "shell - model odes are similar to the fourier - space versions of their parent partial differential equations : ( a ) their dissipative terms are linear in one of the shell variables and quadratic in @xmath105 ; ( b ) their analogues of advection terms are linear in @xmath105 and bilinear in the shell variables ; e.g. , for fluid turbulence a representative term is of the form @xmath106 , with @xmath107 ; and ( c ) they conserve the shell - model analogues of the energy , helicity , etc . , in the absence of dissipation and forcing .",
    "however , variables in a given shell are influenced directly only by their nearest- and next - nearest - neighbour shell variables ; by contrast , fourier transformations of the ns and the ad equations couple every fourier mode to every other fourier mode , leading to the sweeping effect mentioned above .",
    "thus direct sweeping is absent in shell models , so they are often thought of as an approximate , quasi - lagrangian representation of their parent equations .",
    "for studies of decaying turbulence one can envisage several initial conditions .",
    "we have used initial conditions of two types : ( a ) in the first ( type - i ) we drive the system to a statistically steady turbulent state by forcing the first shell ( @xmath108 ) ; we then turn off the force and allow the turbulent state and the associated energy spectrum to decay freely ; our measurements are made in this decaying state ; and ( b ) for the case of fluid turbulence we use a second initial condition ( type - ii ) in which all the energy is concentrated in the first few shells with small @xmath105 , i.e. , large length scales ; we then allow the system to evolve without any force ; the energy cascades to large values of @xmath105 till the energy spectrum becomes similar to that in forced turbulence ; this spectrum then decays slowly in time and the measurements we report are made during this stage of evolution .",

    "we have systematised the study of the dynamic multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions in four models ( a - d ) for passive - scalar ( a , b , and d ) and fluid ( c ) turbulence . by a suitable normalisation of these structure functions ,",
    "we eliminate their dependence on the origin of time @xmath56 at which we initiate our measurements .",
    "we have shown analytically that for the kraichnan model of passive - scalar turbulence ( models a and b ) the two - point time - dependent structure function can be factorised into two parts , one depending on the origin of time @xmath56 and another that does not .",
    "this suggests a suitable normalisation of the structure functions by which we can eliminate their dependence on @xmath56 .",
    "surprisingly the same normalisation works for other models of fluid turbulence ( model c ) and passive - scalar turbulence ( model d ) as we have shown by extensive numerical simulations .",
    "once this dependence on @xmath56 has been factored out , the methods developed earlier  @xcite for statistically steady turbulence yield linear bridge relations that connect dynamic - multiscaling and equal - time exponents .",
    "we show analytically , for models a and b , and numerically , for models b , c , and d , that these exponents and bridge relations are the same for statistically steady and decaying turbulence .",
    "thus we have generalised the universality of equal - time exponents  @xcite and provided strong evidence for dynamic universality , i.e. , dynamic - multiscaling exponents do not depend on whether the turbulence decays or is statistically steady for each of the models a - d .",
    "we have shown elsewhere that these exponents do not depend on the dissipation mechanism by studying the goy model with a hyperviscous term  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to distinguish our results from other studies of temporal dependences of quantities in turbulence .",
    "two such results are described below .",
    "the first example is the result @xmath402 , which holds for the total energy @xmath403 at large times @xmath31 in decaying turbulence  @xcite .",
    "this result holds for times that are longer than the time at which the integral length scale becomes comparable to the size of the system .",
    "[ in decaying turbulence , the integral scale @xmath404 increases with time since the large-@xmath72 part of the energy spectrum @xmath405 , at time @xmath31 , gets depleted as @xmath31 increases . ] in all the results we report here , our shell - model analogue of @xmath406 is well below the linear size of the system , i.e. , @xmath407 .",
    "thus our results are not modified significantly by finite - size corrections , nor does the trivial decay of @xmath403 , mentioned above , set in and mask the dynamic multiscaling we have elucidated .    the second example is the intermittency of velocity time increments studied in ref .",
    "these studies calculate structure functions along a single lagrangian trajectory .",
    "spatial separations , of the sort used in defining equal - time eulerian structure functions , are replaced by temporal separations along a lagrangian trajectory .",
    "this is distinct from the spatiotemporal structure functions we consider and which are required for a full elucidation of dynamic multiscaling here ( and analogous dynamic scaling in critical phenomena ) .",
    "we have described the way in which we have obtained error bars for the equal - time and dynamic - multiscaling exponents .",
    "these error bars only account for statistical errors but not the systematic errors associated with the values of @xmath99 over which we fit inertial - range exponents .",
    "one can try to estimate such systematic errors by obtaining local slopes of log - log plots that yield these exponents .",
    "however , local slopes can be deceptive in shell models since the values of @xmath105 are separated by factors of 2 .",
    "instead , we can try to estimate these systematic errors by comparing the exponents we obtain by fitting over the ranges @xmath408 , @xmath409 , and @xmath410 .",
    "we have carried out such checks in representative cases for the dynamic - multiscaling exponents we report .",
    "the error bars we then obtain are about a factor of 4 larger than those shown in tables 1 - 3 .",
    "we hope our work will stimulate experimental studies of dynamic multiscaling in turbulence .",
    "recent advances in the experimental techniques of particle tracking in turbulent flows  @xcite have made it possible to obtain accurate measurements of lagrangian properties . to obtain the types of structure functions that we have described it",
    "will be necessary at least to track two lagrangian trajectories of particles that are separated initially by a distance @xmath25 . at the level of second - order structure functions",
