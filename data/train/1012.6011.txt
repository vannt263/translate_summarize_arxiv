    "comprehensive study of quantum pendulum has brought to light its various aspects which include the structure of energy spectrum , the time evolution focusing on the quantum revivals @xcite and asymptotic mathieu solutions using algebraic methods  @xcite .",
    "super cold atoms in optical standing field is an area of both theoretical and experimental interest and modeled as quantum pendulum @xcite .",
    "the system is of great importance in classical and quantum domain as an explicit time dependence in phase or amplitude makes the classical counterpart chaotic .",
    "bose - einstein condensates in an optical lattice @xcite is a mile stone and an important paradigm to study atomic condensate evolution , and its phase transition from mott insulator to superfluid state @xcite . quantum revivals in the system present a profound manifestation of quantum interference .",
    "the phenomenon occurs as optical lattice potential is  not perfectly harmonic and level spacing varies with quantum number .",
    "the revivals provide useful information about the coherence time of the atoms in the optical lattice .    in @xcite energy spectrum and time scales encoded in the spectrum",
    "are discussed in detail . in this contribution , we extend the work following the same approach and explain the evolution of super cold weakly condensed atoms in time independent  optical lattice . furthermore , we explain the energy spectrum and eigen states of the system both analytically and numerically .",
    "the time dynamics of the wave packet also translates the relevance of energy spectrum with classical phase space .",
    "we probe distribution of energy eigen states of the potential via wavepacket evolution . for the simplicity we limit our discussion to deep optical lattice where tunneling does not play significant role .",
    "we show : ( i ) an equally spaced local energy spectrum deep in the well which reflects itself in the reconstruction of the wavepacket at classical periods ; ( ii ) beyond this region , the behavior changes as the level spacing modifies itself .",
    "the nonlinear behavior dominates and controls the dynamics as we go farther from the deep - in - the - well condition ; ( iii ) numerical calculations with enhanced efficiency and accuracy in the presence of analytical relationships explain the detailed dynamics of the quantum pendulum and its parametric dependence on anharmonicity .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss atomic interaction with optical lattice and obtain quantum pendulum . in section iii , we work out analytical solutions of the potential . in section iv ,",
    "simplified quantum pendulum is modeled as series expansion of cosine potential and effect of each term of the series is explained which plays the effective role in the atomic evolution@xmath0 in quantum pendulum .",
    "results are discussed in section v.",
    "we consider super cold two - level atoms interacting with a classical monochromatic standing wave field , @xmath1.$ ] here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the frequency and the wave number of the laser field , and @xmath4 is the polarization vector .",
    "we assume that the cavity end mirrors , in @xmath5-plane , reflect the incoming light wave along @xmath6-axis and , therefore , determine the position of the nodes of the standing light along the axis . in dipole and rotating - wave approximations",
    "the atom - field interaction is controlled by the hamiltonian , @xmath7here , @xmath8 is the energy difference between atomic excited state , @xmath9  and ground state , @xmath10 and @xmath11  indicates atomic dipole moment .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 is the center - of - mass momentum of the atom along the cavity axis , @xmath13 is the atomic mass and @xmath14 are the raising and lowering operators defined as ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we have considered condensate densities so low that interparticle interactions are negligible and single particle approach remain applicable @xcite .",
    "thus , we represent the wave function of the system at any time of interaction , @xmath17 as , @xmath18 . in the presence of sufficiently large detuning between the atomic transition frequency and the field frequency ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath19 allows us to neglect spontaneous emission .",
    "furthermore , the same consideration allows us to eliminate the excited state adiabatically and leads to effectively describe the evolution of the atom within the electromagnetic field in its ground state .",
    "hence the dynamics of an atom , is governed effectively by the hamiltonian ,    @xmath20    here , @xmath21 is the effective rabi frequency , where , @xmath22 is rabi frequency .",
    "the probability to find an atom , therefore , in the excited state is negligible as a consequence of large detuning , the evolution properties of the atom in the field are completely determined by the ground state amplitude .",
    "it is useful to define the following dimensionless quantities @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26  we get the dimensionless effective hamiltonian as@xmath27where , the parameters @xmath28 is the effective potential depth and @xmath29 is the recoil shift . in case @xmath30 and the laser is tuned red to the atomic transition , we find @xmath31 as positive .",
    "hence , a phase difference between the potential and laser intensity shifts the location of the potential minima such that they coincide with the locations of the laser intensity maxima .",
    "the atom is , therefore , attracted towards the intensity maxima . in the other case ,",
    "that is @xmath32 the phase difference between the potential and laser intensity disappears and the atom is attracted towards intensity minima .",
    "the quantized system has another controlling parameter as scaled planck s constant @xmath33 which follows the commutation relation @xmath34=k^{\\hspace{-2.1mm}-}.$ ] here , @xmath35 effectively defines the dynamics of a quantum particle as a quantum pendulum .",
    "the eigen states for quantum rotor have the spatial periodicity condition @xmath36 while , eigen states for an atom in optical lattice obeys the general bloch condition @xmath37 where @xmath38 indicates the quasi - momentum of the eigen state .",
    "the general bloch condition satisfy the spatial boundary condition for quantum rotor , when @xmath38 has integer values .",
    "in contrast , the range of @xmath38 is continuous for optical lattices . in both cases the potential only couples the eigen states on a momentum ladder where the ladder spacing is @xmath39 however ,",
    "for optical lattices , there are many momentum ladders independent from each other while for quantum rotor there is only one , centered at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the atom interacting with a standing wave field in the large detuning limit is effectively controlled by the time independent schrdinger wave equation , expressed as@xmath41where , for simplicity we write @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we rewrite the position variable @xmath6  as @xmath44 , and get mathieu equation , @xmath45\\psi _ { n}(x)=0,\\]]which states that for any given @xmath46 and @xmath47 we have a series of solution , @xmath48 for the differential equation , labeled by index @xmath49 hence , @xmath50 defines the eigen function of the system and @xmath51express , respectively , effective potential depth and mathieu characteristic parameter leading to eigen energies .",
    "atom in an optical lattice may observe deep or shallow potential depths corresponding to its energy .",
    "following equation [ q ] , we scale effective potential depth by recoil energy of an atom , @xmath52 .",
    "the atom in cosine potential observes a deep optical potential if effective potential depth @xmath31 is of the order of a few hundred single photon recoil energies and temperature of the atom is around recoil temperature . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the quantum particle in the individual well is independent and one obtains multiple realization of anharmonic oscillators . on the other hand",
    "when the depth of the potential is just few recoil energies and atom is at about recoil temperatures ,  it sees a shallow potential . in this case , the quantum mechanical effects caused by spatial periodicity of optical lattices such as formation of bloch waves become important .",
    "furthermore the levels are broadened into bands due to resonant tunneling between adjacent wells @xcite .",
    "tunneling in the low - lying bands is suppressed as the well depth is increased and particle motion is dominated by single - well dynamics as it is discussed for large @xmath31 .",
    "a moderate values of @xmath31 , with an effective planck s constant of order unity , indicates the deep quantum regime .",
    "the semiclassical dynamics of the atom in the standing wave field are observed however for large values of @xmath31 , which correspond to small values of effective planck s constant @xmath53 and here we find several tightly bound energy bands .",
    "quantum mechanical effects for small @xmath31 , become important once the atomic de broglie wavelength @xmath54 significantly exceeds the lattice constant @xmath55 this gives the condition@xmath56    for a fixed value of @xmath57 , there are countably infinite number of solutions , labeled by @xmath58 however , only for specific characteristic values of the parameter @xmath46 , the solutions will be periodic , with periods @xmath59 or @xmath60 in the variable @xmath61 which are denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively for the even and odd solutions .",
    "because of the intrinsic parity of the potential , the solutions can be characterized as being even , @xmath64 or cosine - like for integral values of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 whereas they are odd , @xmath67 or sine - like for integral values of @xmath65 , with @xmath68 . limiting cases i.e.@xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 for quantum pendulum",
    "are discussed in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "approximate expressions for the characteristic values of @xmath46 and @xmath73 both in @xmath71 and in @xmath72 limits are provided by references abramowitzstegun , mclachlan . for the limit , @xmath71",
    ", we find that the @xmath46 , @xmath73 are approximately degenerate for @xmath74 that is,@xmath75the above expression is not limited to integral value of @xmath65 and is a very good approximation when @xmath65 is of the form , @xmath76 . in case of integral value of @xmath77",
    "the series holds only up to the terms not involving @xmath78  in the denominator .",
    "the difference between the characteristic values for even and odd solutions satisfy@xmath79    in other limiting case , when @xmath72 and the spectrum is oscillator like , we find@xmath80where , @xmath81 it has , thus , @xmath82 dependence in lower order , which resembles harmonic oscillator energy for @xmath83 . here in the deep optical lattice limit , the band width is defined as @xcite@xmath84which shows that in the deep optical lattice ( @xmath72  limit ) energy bands are realized as degenerate energy levels as the band width is negligible .",
    "the band structure of optical lattice is shown in figure-1 , for large @xmath47near the bottom of the lattice , thin band are seen , band width increases and band gap decreases as we move towards the top of the lattice potential well .    as a consequence ,",
    "we suppress atomic tunneling in deep optical lattice limit .",
    "the hoping matrix element , @xmath85  explain the tunneling between adjacent sites for deep optical lattice @xcite , viz,@xmath86equations [ bandwith ] , [ tunneling matrix ] show that the width of the bands corresponds to tunneling of the atom from one lattice site to the other . in the limit of deep lattice potentials , this probability will be exponentially small and band width therefore , reduces exponentially as a function of lattice potential depth .    using algebraic methods , asymptotic",

    "around the minima of lattice sites harmonic evolution prevails and in the presence of the higher order terms it gradually modified to the original potential .",
    "microscopic investigation of the atom - optical system , using term by term contribution of cosine potential expansion reveals the dominant role of the system s particular parametric regime in the formation of eigen - states and eigen energies .",
    "this leads to simplified analytical solutions around the potential minima in the system , as discussed below .      in the deep lattice limit",
    ", the potential near the minima can be approximated as quadratic .",
    "thus the particle placed near the minima of the cosine potential , experiences a harmonic potential .",
    "the energy in this regime is obtained as , @xmath94 which can be identified in equation [ eq3 ] , by ignoring square and higher powers in @xmath95 the eigen states of quadratic potential are given as @xmath96  where , @xmath97 are hermite polynomials and @xmath98    the time evolution of the particle , initially in state @xmath99 is obtained by time evolution operator @xmath100 such that , @xmath101  where , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are energy eigen values and eigen states corresponding to quantum number , @xmath58 the probability amplitudes @xmath104 are defined as , @xmath105 the quantum particle wave packet in optical potential , narrowly peaked around a mean quantum number @xmath106 displays quantum recurrences at different time scales , defined as@xmath107 where , @xmath108 denotes the @xmath109 derivative of @xmath102 with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "the time scale , @xmath110 is termed as classical period as it provides a time at which the particle completes its evolution following the classical trajectory and reshapes itself . whereas , at@xmath111 the particle reshapes itself as a consequence of quantum interference in a nonlinear energy spectrum , which is purely a quantum phenomenon and thus named as quantum revival time . in the parametric regime of a changing nonlinearity with respect to quantum number , @xmath112 we find , the super revival time @xmath113 for the quantum particle @xcite .",
    "we study the time evolution of the material wave packet using square of the autocorrelation function @xcite__,__@xmath114.\\]]in the present parametric regime the square of the autocorrelation function is written as@xmath115where , @xmath116  is independent of time , and defines the interference free , averaged value of @xmath117 .",
    "the most dominant contribution to the @xmath117  comes from @xmath118  in the second part at the right side of equation [ autofun ] .",
    "other terms with , @xmath119  have negligible role because their oscillation frequency is an integral multiple of fundamental frequency @xmath120  and are averaged out to zero . for the reason the square of the autocorrelation function in the present case oscillates following a cosine law with a frequency @xmath121  which leads to a classical time period @xmath122 as shown in figure 2 . here , zero in the superscript of @xmath123 defines the system s classical period in the absence of perturbation . at the integral multiples of classical period ,",

    "the wave packet reappears towards other turning point of the well . in case the wave packet",
    "is initially placed at the center of the cosine well , it reappears at half classical period at the same position but in opposite direction . in this case we see classical revivals of the initial atomic wavepacket and quantum revivals take place at infinitely long time . hence , we find revival of the atomic wavepacket after each classical period only .",
    "experimentally we may realize the situation by placing very few recoil energy atoms deep in the cosine potential well .",
    "this reveals the information about the level spacing around the bottom of the cosine potential .",
    "interestingly we find an equal spacing between the energy levels from figure 1 , for large @xmath57 and small value of @xmath58 the spatiotemporal behavior of  the wave packet in the quadratic potential , as shown in figure 2 , confirms the above results .      beyond harmonic oscillator limit , we find oscillator with nonlinearity and energy level spacing different from a constant value .",
    "the correction to the energy of harmonic oscillator comes from the first order perturbation ( see appendix for energy corrections ) , that is , @xmath132 which again can be identified in equation eq3  by ignoring cubic and higher order powers in @xmath58  the atoms with little higher energy , which is equivalent to several recoil energies observe another time scale in which it reconstructs itself beyond classical period , i.e. quantum revival time .",
    "the behavior of auto - correlation function for the wavepacket exactly placed in this region , where only first order correction is sufficient , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we see that the wave packet displays revivals at quantum revival time .",
    "thus , little above from the bottom of the of an optical lattice , the wave packet sees variations in energy level spacing in a non - linear fashion .",
    "the classical time is modified as @xmath133 where @xmath134 , and classical periodicity for a particle in present situation is related to potential height and mean quantum number , here , @xmath135 as @xmath136 increases , classical revival time also increases , and the ratio , @xmath137 is always less than unity in the region where first correction is sufficient .",
    "the quantum revival time , @xmath138 is independent of mean quantum number @xmath106 whereas super revival time in this case is infinite .    the eigen states of quartic oscillator due to first order perturbation are given as @xmath139where , @xmath140 is first order correction to the harmonic oscillator wave function and is defined as@xmath141here , @xmath142",
    "@xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 and @xmath146 are constants and defined in appendix .    in figure 4 eigen states of quadratic , quartic , sixtic and octic oscillators are mapped on numerically obtained eigen states of cosine potential . from this figure",
    "we see that for @xmath147  and @xmath148 first order correction to the eigen states of unperturbed system matches with harmonic oscillator eigen states up to @xmath149  and mapping of quartic oscillator with exact solution is much improved compare to harmonic oscillator .",
    "similarly mapping of sixtic oscillator is better than quartic oscillator and is quite good for octic oscillator for all bound band . in this case",
    "eight bands exist in side the potential . from figure 1",
    "we note that by increasing @xmath57 number of bound bands can be increased .",

    "the nonlinear term @xmath151 removes a degeneracy present for the harmonic case between the cosine waves corresponding to nearest neighbouring off diagonal terms and beyond .",
    "hence , there overall evolution display a gradual decoherence leading to collapse which latter transforms in revival as the decoherence in waves disappears.the values of @xmath117 in this regime at @xmath152 is simplifies as@xmath153 .",
    "\\label{revtime}\\]]the equation [ revtime ] displays that @xmath154 when @xmath155 is an integral multiple of @xmath156  and also @xmath117 is unity at half of the revival time if @xmath155  is an integral multiple of @xmath157 . in case",
    "the @xmath155 is not an integral multiple of @xmath156 , the wave packet revival occurs little earlier than the revival time @xmath152 and also @xmath117 approaches to unity little earlier than @xmath158 . here",
    "reproduction of wave packet at @xmath158 is out of phase by @xmath159 i.e. at that time all the waves are moving exactly in opposite directions as initially they were .",
    "but at @xmath160 they are all moving in same direction and each wave is in phase not only with there initial states but also with each other .",
    "figure 5 shows spatiotemporal behavior of the wave packet in cosine potential .",
    "we see that wave packet spreads and oscillates in the cosine well , and after some time the original wavepacket is divided into sub - wave - packets figure 5(b ) . at a quantum revival time",
    "these sub - wave - packets constructively interfere and wave packet gains the original shape at the same initial position figure 5(c ) . at quantum revival time , same classical pattern is seen as at the start of the time evolution shown in figure 5(a ) .",
    "higher order nonlinearity in the energy spectrum of the quantum pendulum show up beyond quartic limit . in the presence of the second correction ,",
    "the energy is modified by the term @xmath161 second correction to the energy modifies the time scales .",
    "the classical time period is now @xmath162 whereas the quantum revival time is modified as @xmath163 here , @xmath164 @xmath165 are constants .",
    "in addition system shows another time scale , i.e. super revival time @xmath166 at which reconstruction of original wave packet takes place .",
    "the other quantum revival times occur at infinity .",
    "the energy eigen states in this regime are given as @xmath167 where , @xmath168 is perturbation in eigen states due to the @xmath169 term and @xmath170 is second order perturbation caused by @xmath171 term @xcite . the expressions @xmath170 and @xmath172",

    "however , in the present regime , the quantum revival time is not constant and decreases as @xmath136 increases .",
    "the @xmath136 dependence of quantum revival time is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the super revival time is independent of mean quantum number .",
    "it is directly proportional to square root of potential height and inversely proportional to the square of scaled planck s constant .",
    "the temporal behavior of an atom in optical potential placed in this regime shows three time scales : classical periods enveloped in quantum revivals and quantum revivals enveloped in super revivals as shown in figure 7 . after each super revival time the atomic wave packet evolution repeats itself",
    "similarly third correction in energy , modify the energy by the factor @xmath179 .",
    "the time scales in this case are @xmath180 and@xmath181 where @xmath182and @xmath183 and super revival time is @xmath184 where @xmath185 furthermore , the super quartic revival time , @xmath186 , is independent of @xmath136 .",
    "the higher order corrections in energy show that other time scales do exist in the system , but their times of recurrence are too large to consider them finite .    in the presence of third correction to energy ,",
    "classical time increases as @xmath136 increases but increases little faster than in the cases of quartic and sixtic corrections , whereas , the quantum revival time decreases faster as @xmath136 increases compared to the case of sixtic correction .",
    "the super revival time is not constant but decreases as @xmath136 increases .",
    "energy corrections increase anharmonicity in the system .",
    "we discussed that the first order correction to harmonic potential energy led to the quantum revivals , the second order energy correction led to super revivals and fourth correction led to quartic revival time .",
    "comparison of revival times for different energy corrections is shown in figure 6 . for first order energy correction quantum  revival time is constant , but for higher order corrections , revival time may decrease with increasing mean quantum number of the wavepacket .    in figure 4",
    "we  show the projection of numerically calculated eigen states of cosine potential on the eigen states of quadratic , quartic ( first correction to quadratic potential ) , sixtic ( second correction to quadratic potential ) and octic ( third correction to quadratic potential ) potentials .",
    "we note that the eigen states of all above mentioned potentials match to the eigen states of quadratic potential near the bottom of lattice potential . for little large quantum numbers",
    ", we see that projection of quadratic potential falls sharply and improves with higher order potentials .",
    "this correction is quite good for octic potential when @xmath187 justifying @xmath188 condition .",
    "eigen states and eigen energies of quartic , sixtic and octic potentials are analytically calculated using the method given in appendix .",
    "in this paper we have extended  the understanding of eigen energy levels and eigen states in deep optical lattice , both analytically and numerically .",
    "we note that solutions obtained through perturbation theory and mathieu solution are showing similar results and are in very good agreement with exact numerical solutions .",
    "the energy levels are equally spaced near the bottom and by increasing the lattice potential depth , the number of equally spaced energy levels can be increased .",
    "a wave packet placed in this region revives after each classical period . from figure 4",
    ", it is also noted that all potentials discussed have equally spaced eigen levels at the bottom of the potential well as their mapping with harmonic oscillator is unity . beyond linear regime ,",
    "energy dependence is quadratic and any wavepacket evolved in this region shows complete quantum revivals enveloped by classical revivals . interestingly in this regime",
    "quantum revival time ( @xmath189 ) is independent of potential height , however has inverse proportionality with effective planck s constant , @xmath53 .",
    "we show that for deep optical lattice , there is a region in which revivals are independent of lattice depth and this region expands with the increase in lattice depth , however beyond this region quantum revival time is no longer constant but decreases as @xmath136 increases . the higher order time scale , super revival time @xmath190 exists in this region and is independent of @xmath136 .",
    "again this region expands as potential height is increased but super revival time in this region is directly proportional to square root of potential height .    above this region",
    "other time scales also exist where super revival time is @xmath136 dependent and decreases as @xmath136 increases but these time scales are too long to consider them finite .",
