    "the study of binary and multiple systems in the local neighborhood is important for several reasons .",
    "it is desirable to have an accurate accounting of stellar systems in the local neighborhood . improving the statistics of binary primary masses , system mass fractions , orbital separations , and eccentricities are crucial for refining stellar and planetary formation theories .",
    "also , studying wide separation systems in particular gives insight into their dynamic stability with time as a function of orbital separation and mass fraction ( and hence binding energy ) against disruptive events such as close approaches to giant molecular clouds , stars , and the gravitational potential of the inner galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present three wide separation l - dwarf companions to nearby stars .",
    "one companion has an apparent separation @xmath2 of 100 au @xmath3 au , and two have @xmath4 au .",
    "these discoveries , along with similar companions previously reported , highlight the success in searching new portions of binary system phase space ( i.e. wide separations ) by surveys such as two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , the deep near - infrared survey ( denis ; @xcite ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the surveys sensitivities and large areal coverages allow for very low - mass ( vlm ) stars and brown dwarf companions to be found at separations @xmath5 au . ) , to mean ` apparent separation . ' ] the new detections will in turn improve the statistics of systems with mass ratios ( @xmath6 ) far from unity . , and use the term ` low mass ratio ' to mean @xmath6 near zero . ] for instance , the low - mass companions already discovered show that the ` brown dwarf desert ' at close separation ( @xmath7 % of fgkm main sequence primaries have brown dwarf companions at @xmath8 au ; @xcite ) may not extend to wide separations @xcite .",
    "the added statistics can also be used to test the mass ratio distribution results of @xcite : their distribution peaks at @xmath9 and is then either flat or decreases for @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite , however , used the radial velocity technique for searching for unknown companions , a technique poorly suited for discovering @xmath11 systems at wide separation .    the study of vlm stars and brown dwarfs as singular objects also benefits from the discovery of these objects as companions in binary systems . because brown dwarfs continually cool with time since they can not sustain hydrogen fusion , and vlm stars near the main sequence limit can take a hubble time to come to equilibrium , degeneracies occur in the hr diagram for these objects .",
    "for example , a field l1 v can either be a very old and vlm star or a less massive , young brown dwarf that is slowly cooling to later spectral types .",
    "binary systems can be used to break this degeneracy and provide examples of l - dwarfs with estimated masses as follows : assuming that the primary and low - mass companion in a system are coeval , age estimates from the primary can be adopted for the secondary .",
    "the ages along with inferred effective temperatures can then be used to determine crude mass estimates from theoretical evolutionary curves .",
    "metallicity and distance information is also acquired for l - dwarfs in binary systems from known properties of the primaries .",
    "there are six previously discovered l - dwarfs that are wide separation ( @xmath0 au ) companions to nearby stars ( see @xcite , table 7a , for a summary ) , including three from 2mass .",
    "the latter were l - dwarf candidates found to be serendipitously located close on the sky to known nearby stars . in this paper",
    "we present the first results from a _ dedicated 2mass search for l - dwarf candidates in close proximity on the sky to known nearby stars .",
    "the search area around any given candidate primary is an annulus with inner radius defined by the object brightness and the capability of the 2mass point source extraction algorithm to identify faint objects adjacent to bright sources .",
    "the outer radius is defined by the distance to the primary and the maximum companion separation plausible from dynamical binding considerations .",
    "the candidate primaries are mainly drawn from the catalogue of nearby stars @xcite and other nearby objects discovered more recently .",
    "a future paper will discuss in more detail the search criteria and success rate . in this paper",
    "we present two confirmed ( spectroscopic and common proper - motion ) companions discovered while searching the vicinity of two ` gliese ' objects : 2massw j0912145 + 145940 ( l8 v companion to a g8 v@xmath1k1 v spectroscopic binary ) and 2massw j1620261 - 041631 ( l2.5 v companion to an m0 v ) .",

    "lithium is not detected in any of the objects to the following equivalent width ( ew ) upper limits : @xmath80  for gl 337c and gl 618.1b , and @xmath81  for hd 89744b .",

    "gl 618.1b is a possible detection with @xmath93  .",
    "these results are compatible with the l - dwarf activity statistics from the k99 and k00 samples , in which @xmath92 emission declined from 60% ( 80% if marginal detections are included ) for l0 v to 8% ( 25% including two marginal detections ) for l8 v @xcite .",
    "statistically we might have expected emission in hd 89744b , but it is not surprising that gl 618.1b and gl 337c are not active .",
    "the wavelength of peak energy emission shifts redward into the nir with decreasing effective temperature , so l - dwarfs become very faint in the red - optical .",
    "as noted in k99 , a large aperture telescope is needed to use red - optical spectral typing schemes effectively .",
    "because a more practical means of assigning spectral types to color - selected late - m and l - dwarfs was sought , the cornell massachusetts slit spectrograph ( cormass ; @xcite ) was built for use on the palomar 60-inch telescope .",
    "over 100 new field late - m and l - dwarf candidates have been observed with cormass as part of a magnitude - limited spectroscopic survey to improve the statistics of the luminosity function across the stellar  sub - stellar boundary in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the instrument has also been used for the spectral confirmation of a bright t - dwarf @xcite and now for the follow - up of some candidate wide separation companions in @xcite and this paper .",

    "the m - dwarf spectral types are on the @xcite system , and l - dwarf classifications are on the k99 system .",
    "the data reduction technique follows that described in @xcite .",
    "our grid qualitatively agrees with similar nir grids of l - dwarfs already published @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure [ nir grid ] , the nir spectra are dominated by molecular absorption features that smoothly change with spectral type through the end of the l - class .",
    "the @xmath99 absorption features bracketing h - band change most obviously .",
    "in particular , the slope of the blue side of the h - band spectra appears to increase monotonically with later spectral type as @xmath99 absorption increases in the l - dwarf atmospheres .",
    "this monotonic relationship has been quantitatively confirmed for a grid of l - dwarfs by @xcite and @xcite and for a grid of m - dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also use this feature to help classify denis candidate low - mass objects .",
    "other spectral changes in the grid include varying strengths of the feh features at @xmath100 and 1.19 - 1.24 @xmath12 , as well as changes in the pair of doublets in j - band .",
    "the evolution of the j - band features were investigated by @xcite using higher resolution spectra of l - dwarfs .",
    "k - band evolution seen in figure [ nir grid ] includes increasing @xmath101 absorption on the blue end , increasing curvature longward of @xmath102 due to collision induced absorption of @xmath103 , and a deepening of the co bandhead feature at @xmath104 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the slow spectral evolution for late - m and l - dwarfs is in marked contrast to the rapid change in features observed from l8 v to t dwarfs as the primary carbon - bearing molecule changes from co to @xmath105 .",
    "cormass observations of the companions are listed in table [ observations ] .",
    "the spectra have been inserted into figure [ nir grid ] at positions bracketed by known objects with similar spectra based upon comparisons by eye .",
    "the nir spectra of gl 337c supports a spectral type assignment of l8 v. the depth of the j - band @xmath99 ( @xmath106 ) absorption feature indicates a spectral type later than l7 v. the spectra of gl 618.1b ( smoothed with a boxcar average of 5 pixels ) and hd 89744b are both similar to those of the late - m and early l - dwarfs . because the spectral features evolve more slowly in this regime we can not confirm a specific spectral type by eye . the spectra support a range of spectral types : m9 v @xmath107 l3.5 v and m9 v @xmath108 l2 v.    at the resolution of cormass ( r @xmath109 ) quantitative comparison of spectral type indices ( i.e. ratios of average flux in specified regions , or equivalent widths , etc . )",
    "will be necessary to improve the accuracy of spectral subclass assignments based upon nir spectra .",
    "in a subsequent paper @xcite we will define quantitative spectral indices for assignment of spectral subclass for use with the cormass spectroscopic survey of field low - mass object candidates .",
    "the assignment of ages to field stars is by its very nature imprecise due primarily to few reliable techniques , cosmic scatter , and especially slow evolution for stars with late spectral types .",
    "hopefully the analysis of systems with late - m and l - dwarf wide separation companions will motivate increased study of ` age dating ' techniques .",
    "this necessarily lengthy section gathers available evidence and applies relevant techniques to derive unfortunately imprecise age estimates for the primary systems of the l - dwarf companions",
    ".    published age related properties for the three primary systems are summarized in table [ primproperties ] . a decrease in activity ( coronal and chromospheric ) with age in stars with convective envelopes",
    "is generally attributed to a reduction in the classical dynamo effect ( @xmath110-@xmath111 ) as stars spin down due to angular momentum losses in stellar winds ( see e.g. @xcite )    surface lithium abundance from high resolution spectroscopy can serve as a crude age indicator for main sequence stars with convective envelopes .",
    "primordial surface lithium in these stars is destroyed through mixing to warmer interior temperatures due to the combined action of convection in the outer envelope and more complex mechanisms not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "only one of the three primaries in this paper have published lithium abundance measurements , namely hd 89744a .",
    "unfortunately , the measurement s usefulness as an age diagnostic is diminished because , as an f7 iv - v , it falls very close to the mid - f ` lithium dip ' region of the main sequence in which dramatic surface lithium destruction occurs where standard evolutionary models using convective mixing predict there should be no destruction ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath191 ) of 8 km @xmath145 @xcite for hd 89744a supports a spectral type of f7 iv - v .",
    "this rotation falls squarely in the 0 to 20 km @xmath145 range found in a study of late - f subgiants by @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite and @xcite found a sharp rotational discontinuity at @xmath192 , or f8 iv .",

    "while there is significant scatter in the rotational velocities of mid to late f - dwarfs , the @xmath191 of hd 89744a is compatible with a subgiant evolving redward towards the f8 iv discontinuity .",
    "@xcite reported an upper limit of @xmath195 from rosat measurements in their study of x - ray emission from early post - main sequence stars . from equation ( [ xray ] ) this gives a minimum coronal age of 1.2 gyr ( @xmath131 ) and 1.7 gyr ( @xmath132 ) .",

    "why are the chromospheric age estimates above so much older than ages from fits to isochrones ?",
    "interestingly , hd 89744a is known to have flat activity cycles ( i.e. no evidence of activity cycles such as the 11 year solar cycle ) .",
    "because of its flat chromospheric emission , @xcite used this object as a standard in his studies of activity variability . over a 25 year period the standard deviation of s ( @xmath210 ) for this object was 1.2% @xcite .",
    "@xcite postulated that solar - type stars that exhibit prolonged low levels of magnetic activity may be in maunder minimum - like phases .",
    "if hd 89744a is in such a phase then measures of activity will lead to old age estimates that are misleading .",
    "lastly , we note that evolutionary diagrams predict even @xmath211 stars to reach the tip of the red - giant branch in @xmath212 gyr @xcite ; the @xmath213 hd 89744a would be a white dwarf at the ages predicted by its activity .",

    "based upon the well correlated published ages from isochrone fits , as well as evidence of proximity to the main sequence turn - off , we adopt an age of 1.5 - 3 gyr for hd 89744a .",
    "we ignore age estimates from activity .",
    "with estimated ages for the l - dwarf companions from  [ ages ] and effective temperature estimates from spectral types (  [ os ] ) , the masses of the l - dwarf companions can be estimated using evolutionary models from @xcite . in figure [ evolutionary curves ] error boxes",

    "returning to the three wide - companions in this paper , we find it interesting to compare these systems to other binaries in ( @xmath237 ) and ( @xmath238 ) plots .",
