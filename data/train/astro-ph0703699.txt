    "massive stars are among the most important cosmic stellar yardsticks in stellar populations at low and high redshift . yet , in many regards they still pose serious challenges in evolutionary synthesis modeling . for instance , evolutionary connections with and between wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , the significance of the nitrogen ( wn ) and carbon ( wc ) sequence among the wr stars , the ratio of blue to red supergiants , stellar surface abundances , or stellar mass loss are all poorly understood @xcite .",
    "the geneva and padova groups perfected the state - of - the - art of stellar evolution modeling in the uppermost hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) with the release of complete set of stellar evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "these sets have become widely used in population synthesis modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "previous modeling of massive star evolution paid particular attention to the size of the convective core and stellar mass loss , which were thought ( together with standard nuclear processing ) to be the most relevant ingredients in massive star evolution .",
    "this view has changed quite dramatically in recent years .",
    "it is become clear that stellar rotation plays a dominant  and in some cases even _ the _ dominant  role in the evolution of stars with masses above @xmath110  m@xmath2 @xcite . as a result",
    ", the previous generation of stellar evolution models , which do not take into account rotation , may be subject to revision .",
    "this in turn will affect all population synthesis modeling relying on these tracks .",
    "recently , a new set of tracks has been released by the geneva group ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which addresses stellar rotation .",
    "this set of tracks should be considered `` exploratory '' , i.e. , it is still incomplete and not meant to fully replace the currently available full set of tracks without rotation . these new tracks , however , are invaluable in exploring the fundamental effects caused by stellar rotation and gauging the impact on stellar population modeling .",
    "consequently we have implemented this new set of tracks into the latest version 5.1 of the evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 @xcite .",
    "the resulting new version of starburst99 is not publicly available , as the limited number of evolutionary tracks does not yet allow the computation of models by the astronomical community that could be compared to a wide range of observations .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we summarize the main astrophysical ingredients in the new stellar evolution models with rotation and highlight differences with respect to the previous non - rotating grid .",
    "we also discuss details of the implementation in starburst99 in this section .",
    "a parameter study of the most important stellar population properties affected by rotation is performed in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we compare the model predictions obtained with starburst99 to observations .",
    "finally , the conclusions are in section  5 .",
    "in this section we will describe the most important characteristics of the new set of geneva tracks and highlight differences with respect to previous tracks",
    ". the discussion will be relatively brief and limited to aspects that are directly relevant to the implementation of the tracks into starburst99 .",
    "the effects of rotation can be classified in three categories : 1 ) the hydrostatic effects , 2 ) the rotationally induced instabilities and their impacts on the transport of the chemical species and of the angular momentum , 3 ) the effects of rotation on mass loss .",
    "the hydrostatic effects account for the fact that a rotating star is deformed .",
    "the stellar structure equations are modified with respect to the non - rotating case .",
    "the method used here is the one proposed by @xcite , adapted to the case of shellular rotation as explained in @xcite .",
    "the two main instabilities triggered by rotation are the meridional circulation and the shear instabilities .",
    "the effects of these two instabilities on the transport of the chemical species and the angular momentum are modeled as proposed by @xcite .",
    "this theory describes the interactions of these two instabilities in a consistent way .",
    "it is based on one sole a priori hypothesis , namely that the star is in a state of shellular rotation ( angular velocity @xmath3 constant on isobaric surfaces ) .",
    "this hypothesis is quite reasonable from a physical point of view , since on an isobaric surface , there is no force counteracting the horizontal , _",
    "i.e. _ isobaric , turbulence .",
    "the effects of rotation on mass loss have been included as prescribed by @xcite .",
    "note that anisotropic stellar winds were included only for the models at @xmath4 .",
    "the rotational velocities considered in these models are too modest for this effect to be important at other chemical compositions .",
    "more details on the physics of the models can be found in @xcite .",
    "extensive coverage of the physics of rotation in the geneva tracks is provided in a series of papers published by the geneva group ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references to prior papers therein ) .",
    "the physical effects of rotation are discussed in detail in this series of papers and will not be repeated here .",
    "the new stellar evolution models used in the present population synthesis modeling are those of @xcite .",
    "the rotating models account for the transport of the chemical species and of the angular momentum driven by meridional circulation and shear instabilities .",
    "the models were computed with an initial equatorial velocity on the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) of 300 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "different processes during the main sequence phase ( e.g. , the expansion of outer layers , transport of angular momentum by stellar winds , etc . )",
    "decrease this velocity , so that the time - averaged velocity on the main sequence for different chemical compositions is 200    250  km  s@xmath0 ( see tables in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have measured stellar rotation velocities of galactic b - type stars in ngc  3293 and ngc  4755 whose estimated ages are 10 and 15 myr , respectively .",
    "dufton et al .",
    "obtained a distribution of velocities that peaks at 250 km s@xmath0 after accounting for a random distribution of the inclination for stars with masses between 3 and 12 m@xmath2 ] .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite obtained mean velocities of 150  ",
    "180 km s@xmath0 for o and b - type stars in the smc with initial masses in the range of 15 to 30 m@xmath2 . in view of these recent results",
    ", we see that our averaged velocities might be overestimated for the smc stars , while they seem to be in good agreement for galactic stars .",
    "of course , for a proper comparisons with observations , one should compute models for the whole range of observed velocities and then convolve the results with the distribution of the initial velocities .",
    "we think that the results of the 300  km  s@xmath0 models will sufficiently well represent the averaged evolution so that meaningful comparisons can already be performed on the basis of these simple models .",
    "the initial compositions were calculated as in @xcite , where @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that @xmath9 , 0.744 , 0.640 and @xmath10 , 0.248 , 0.320 for heavy - element abundances of @xmath11 , 0.008 , 0.040 , respectively . in the case of solar chemical composition , the values are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the heavy - element ratios were assumed to remain constant with @xmath14 and are the same as those used to calculate the opacities for solar composition .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates were taken from the nacre data base @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of opacities and nuclear reactions can be also found in @xcite .",
    "moderate overshooting is included in all the new models with and without rotation @xcite .    for the main sequence ,",
    "the mass - loss rates are from @xcite , who take into account the abrupt change of the ionization and opacity of the stellar wind at certain temperatures , as explained by @xcite .",
    "the empirical formula of @xcite was used for the domain not covered by @xcite . for the wr phase",
    ", the mass - loss rates of @xcite were used .",
    "we note that our adopted main - sequence mass - loss rates were derived from theoretical wind models .",
    "@xcite found good agreement between these rates and those observed in o stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the agreement is less satisfacory , however , for b supergiants whose observed rates are lower than predicted .",
    "these rates are empirical , as opposed to the theoretical main - sequence rates . the nugis & lamers rates , which account for the clumping effects in the winds , are smaller by a factor of 2    3 than the rates used in the previous non - rotating `` enhanced mass - loss rate '' stellar grids .",
    "the correction factor for enhancing the theoretical mass loss due to rotation was taken from maeder & meynet .",
    "the dependence on chemical composition during non - wr phases was expressed as @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "wr mass - loss rates were assumed to be @xmath14-independent in the default set of tracks .",
    "however , an additional set of tracks with @xmath14-dependent mass - loss rates for the wr phase was computed for models with @xmath16 ; @xcite suggested the same dependence of the mass - loss rates on @xmath14 for wr stars as for o stars ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the mass - loss rates differ from those in the previous release of the geneva tracks .",
    "the temperature distribution of a rotating star is described by the local radiative flux , which is proportional to the effective gravity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the sum of the gravity and the centrifugal force @xcite .",
    "then the local effective temperature on the surface of the rotating star varies like @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the rotational velocity . due to this effect , the emergent luminosity",
    ", colors and spectrum will be different for different orientation angles _ i _ @xcite . in order to avoid such complications",
    ", we define an average stellar @xmath22 by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is stefan s constant and @xmath25 the total actual stellar surface deformed by rotation .",
    "this is the average value of the effective temperature which will be used for visualizing the evolutionary tracks in the theoretical hrds and for evaluating the radiation outputs .",
    "since wr winds have a non - negligible optical thickness , a correction is applied to new stellar models by adopting an effective radius @xmath26 at the optical thickness @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath26 is related to the photospheric radius via the relation    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the opacity , @xmath30 is the mass - loss rate , and @xmath31 is the wind terminal velocity .",
    "this procedure is similar to that followed in @xcite in the previous set of tracks .",
    "subsequently , the effective temperature at @xmath27 is calculated with the relation @xmath32 .",
    "the wr atmospheres are linked to the stellar models using the empirical relation of @xcite who defined the evolutionary temperatures as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the temperature of the wr core .",
    "this new definition is a compromise between the hotter interior and the cooler surface temperature and serves as the interface temperature used in the expanding model atmospheres .",
    "smith et al .",
    "empirically determined this relation by comparing their model predictions to the observed temperature distributions of galactic wc and wn stars .      in the interior of the star ,",
    "the angular velocity varies due to the following effects : contraction / expansion of the stellar layers and transport of angular momentum by convection , meridional currents and shear instabilities . without the transport processes , the change of @xmath3",
    "would only be governed by the local conservation of the angular momentum . in that case",
    ", there is no coupling between the various stellar layers , each one keeping its initial angular momentum content .",
    "in contrast , the transport processes impose some coupling between them . during the main - sequence phase and",
    "in the outer part of the star , the transport mechanisms relocate angular momentum from the inner to the outer regions .",
    "this tends to slow down the contracting core and to accelerate the expanding outer envelope .",
    "when the stellar winds are weak , as for instance in metal - poor regions , the angular momentum can accumulate in the outer layers so that the surface velocity increases with time , approaching the critical limit .",
    "when the stellar winds are strong , the angular momentum of the outer layers is removed and the surface velocity decrease , evolving away from the critical limit .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the mass loss for shaping the evolution of the surface velocities of massive stars .",
    "the differences between the previous and the new evolutionary models result from a combination of effects .",
    "first and foremost , rotation introduces the majority of the changes .",
    "in addition , the opacities and overshooting are different .",
    "the former produce a shift in temperature towards lower effective temperatures .",
    "the overshooting is responsible for lower effective temperatures during the main - sequence , and combined with a core extension due to rotation it also affects the blue loops during the he - burning phase .",
    "other major effects are :    * tracks with rotation become more luminous than those with no rotation . as a consequence",
    ", the derived mass of a star on the hrd will be lower than compared with non - rotating tracks . *",
    "the main - sequence width is enlarged due to rotation and overshooting for stars with initial masses below @xmath35  m@xmath2 .",
    "this effect results from a larger he - core produced during the h - burning phase . * for masses higher than 50 m@xmath2",
    ", the opposite effect occurs .",
    "for instance , the reddest point reached by the 60 m@xmath2 non - rotating stellar model at the end of the main - sequence phase is @xmath36 , whereas for the rotating model , it is @xmath37 .",
    "this is a consequence of the lower diffusion time scale ratio for chemical elements at higher initial mass .",
    "massive stars will be more mixed than stars with lower masses at the same evolutionary stage",
    ". a higher degree of homogeneity is reached , and this turns the star bluer .",
    "combined with these effects , rotation and mass loss change the stellar surface composition and favor the formation of wr stars .",
    "* the mass - loss rates used in the present models are smaller than the high rates used in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the final masses at the end of the he - burning phase are larger than those in @xcite .",
    "*   the main - sequence life times at @xmath38 and 0.04 have increased by 15    25 and 16  ",
    "27% in comparison with the non - rotating models , respectively .",
    "this is mainly an effect of rotational mixing which continuously supplies the core with fresh nuclear fuel , i.e. , hydrogen .",
    "the increase of the luminosity due to rotation can not compensate for this effect , and the main - sequence life times are increased by rotation , at least in this metallicity range .",
    "the wr phase is significant for massive stars , and stellar rotation can dramatically affect this phase .",
    "our knowledge of this phase is insufficient to permit constraints on the properties of wr stars purely from first principles @xcite . therefore some ad hoc assumptions must be made .",
    "for the present stellar models , the star enters into the wr phase when 1 ) @xmath39 and 2 ) when the mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface is @xmath40 .",
    "there is no significantly different outcome if the value for @xmath41 varies between 0.3 or 0.4 . in the first release of starburst99 @xcite",
    ", the definition of a wr star was based on the work of @xcite , who used a minimum temperature limit for a wr star of @xmath42 .",
    "this limit is 0.4    0.5 dex higher than that assumed in the new tracks .",
    "recent observations of wc / wn ratios in the magellanic clouds resulted in better agreement with a lower temperature limit @xcite .",
    "the wr definition via teff is arguably rather adhoc and needs to be addressed .",
    "therefore we have studied synthesis models with both temperature limits and with the old and new sets of tracks to gauge the importance of this parameter for the wr properties .",
    "we are also interested in the stellar mass at the entrance and during the wr phase . as a reminder ,",
    "the most massive stars enter the wr phase while still in the h - burning phase .",
    "two different mass limits for the wr phase have been defined by the geneva group @xcite .",
    "the first one is the mass limit to enter to the wr phase on the main - sequence ( @xmath43 ) ; the second mass limit is the mass to enter the wr phase at any time during the evolution of the star ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the first limit implies an evolutionary scenario avoiding the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase so that the phases covered are o - ewnl - ewne - wc / wo .",
    "the second mass limit implies an evolutionary scenario first going through the o - lbv or red supergiant ( rsg ) phases and then following the sequence ewnl - ewne - wc / wo .",
    "the mass limits for different sets of tracks are shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "no rigorous comparison with observations has been made but the sparse data suggest a higher @xmath43 closer to 75 m@xmath2 for galactic stars @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows evolutionary tracks for 60 m@xmath2 with an indication of the entry point into the wr phase for four different chemical compositions for the new models with @xmath45 km s@xmath0 .",

    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the principal new set of tracks has an initial @xmath47 of 300 km s@xmath0 with four different values of the chemical composition , as described in section  2.2 .",

    "the non - rotating models were used to calibrate and compare the new models with rotation to the previous sets of tracks .",
    "these tracks were generated for @xmath48 and 0.04 .",
    "an additional set of tracks with @xmath49 and metallicity dependent wr mass - loss rates is used in this paper as well .",
    "the tracks were computed up to the end of the he - burning phase in all cases .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] summarizes the covered mass range for the different metallicities .",
    "the tracks with solar chemical composition have the most complete coverage of parameter space .",
    "tracks were released in the same way as the previous set of tracks by considering equivalent evolutionary time - step points along each track . the number of points , however , increases by a factor of 7 .",
    "point 1 defines the zams , point 100 is the end of the h - burning phase , point 201 is the beginning of the he - burning phase , and point 350 is the end of the he - burning phase .",
    "the new set of tracks predict the same stellar parameters as in the original set of the geneva tracks .",
    "new parameters like the ratio of the polar to the equatorial radii , equatorial velocity and angular velocity ( @xmath50 ) are also included in the new release . throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the following nomenclature : the `` old geneva tracks '' are the previous tracks with high mass - loss rates used as default by starburst99 .",
    "the `` new geneva tracks with or without rotation '' are the new tracks with @xmath45  km s@xmath0 and 0  km s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the method of implementation into starburst99 was similar to the one used by @xcite .",
    "however , the number of grid points of the new tracks is different . in order to be consistent with the existing , old set of tracks , we carefully selected 77 grid points to define key evolutionary phases and cover periods of rapid evolutionary changes . to achieve consistency",
    ", we found it necessary to resample the old geneva tracks from the original 51 to 84 grid points .",
    "the old tracks extend up to the c - burning phase .",
    "we re - built the new tracks with 84 points as well , even though their evolution does not go beyond the he - burning phase .",
    "this leaves 7 slots available for a future implementation of the c - burning phase .",
    "the purpose of this section is to compare integrated parameters from starburst99 obtained with the old and new tracks .",
    "constant star formation and instantaneous burst models were generated with an initial mass function ( imf ) index of @xmath51 over the mass range of 1.0    100 m@xmath2 until 100 myr .",
    "we used the fully line - blanketed atmospheres of @xcite for hot stars and atlas9 models adjusted by @xcite for stars of spectral type b and later .      as a first comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] isochrones for two different abundances ( @xmath52 and 0.020 ) produced with the new tracks with rotation of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 ( left ) and those produced with the old geneva tracks ( right ) . in each case",
    "the oldest isochrone corresponds to the age at which the lowest mass included in the new models with @xmath45  km s@xmath0 is present ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "isochrones produced with the new tracks are more luminous than those obtained with the old geneva tracks .",
    "stars on the rsg branch with @xmath52 are bluer than those obtained with the old geneva tracks . in the case of @xmath53 ,",
    "the new isochrones do not have the extended blue loop except for the model with 9 m@xmath2 .",
    "as this is the lowest mass model included in the new set of tracks , this isolated blue loop for just one mass will create a bump in the integrated light properties , as we will see below .",
    "@xcite discuss how the reduction of the blue loops in the new tracks with rotation results from the combined effect of overshooting and the core extension by rotation .",
    "we have compared the stellar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for young ages . throughout this paper",
    "we follow the convention to plot the models with the different sets of tracks from the geneva group with enhanced mass loss , the new models with @xmath46 , and the new models with @xmath45 km s@xmath0 with solid , short - dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "young population models with @xmath38 in the range of 1 - 15 myr were divided and are plotted in two different figures .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows models up to 6 myr , and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the models with older ages .",
    "seds produced by the models with rotation show an energy increase around the neutral helium edge with respect to the models with old geneva tracks , which can be up to @xmath54 dex .",

    "the flat sections at the shortest wavelengths of some spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are numerical artifacts .    the difference between the old and new models in the range of @xmath55 at ages 3  ",
    "7  myr may not appear very striking with the scaling in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "nevertheless , it amounts to about a factor of two for the number of ionizing photons , as we will discuss below .",
    "the onset and disappearance of the enhanced ionizing luminosity coincides with the presence of wr stars in the new models with rotation .    at even longer wavelengths above @xmath56  ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) ,",
    "the difference in luminosity is @xmath57 dex for the same young ages covered in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . when the age increases and rsgs begin to dominate the red and near - infrared part of the sed , the models with rotation become even more luminous as they predict a larger number of rsgs .",
    "we restrict our discussion of the seds to the case of @xmath53 because only this set of evolutionary models is sufficiently complete to allow the computation of a meaningful sed .",
    "the first test for studying the effects of rotation , mass loss , and temperature change is the ratio of the number of wr to o stars for an instantaneous burst .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows this ratio for six different instantaneous burst models : old geneva tracks and @xmath42 ( red solid line ) ; old geneva tracks and @xmath58 ( red long - dashed ) ; new tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 and @xmath42 ( blue dotted ) ; new tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 and @xmath58 ( blue dot - dashed ) ; new tracks of @xmath46 km s@xmath0 and @xmath58 ( black short - dashed ) ; new tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 , @xmath58 and different mass mass loss rate for wr phases at @xmath59 ( dot long - dashed ) . as a word of caution , the new models with lower chemical composition than solar are incomplete at the lowest masses . while the wr evolution is well covered using the new tracks , the evolution of the least massive o stars is not .    the wr - rich phase after an instantaneous starburst covers a larger interval of ages when rotation is accounted for .",
    "this comes from the fact that rotational mixing aids an entry at an earlier evolutionary stage . in order to appreciate this point better , recall that mass loss by stellar winds is the key process allowing nuclearly processed layers to appear at the surface and thus make the star enter into the wr phase in non - rotating models . in the case of rotating models",
    ", another effect contributes in building the chemical characteristics of the stellar surface of wr stars : the mixing induced by rotation brings elements produced in the stellar core to the surface .",
    "thus , for the present mass - loss rates , rotation favors an entrance into the wr regime at an evolutionary stage when the central hydrogen mass fraction is higher . as a consequence",
    ", the wr lifetimes will be longer . also , stars with lower initial mass can be progenitors of wr stars . an immediate consequence",
    "are the peaks in the wr / o ratio between 6 and 9 myr for @xmath60 and 0.040 .",
    "these artifacts result when wr stars exist but most o stars have already evolved into b stars .    furthermore , the wr phase lasts significantly longer in the new models so that the overall effect is a net increase of the wr / o ratio in an equilibrium population .",
    "this becomes obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where we have plotted the same ratio for constant star formation .",
    "the higher number of wr stars in the new models is significant .    generally , there are more wr stars in the new stellar models with rotation and with the lower temperature limit for the wr phase .",
    "it is important to realize that most of this difference is caused by wr stars evolving from the lowest masses .",
    "these are the most populous species , and varying their numbers has the most dramatic effect .      the same cautionary remarks on incompleteness as in the previous subsection apply here .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the wc / wn ratio for instantaneous star formation . as in the case of the wr / o ratio , we plot models for constant star formation as well ( fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the general trend in these figures is a decrease of wc / wn , in particular at low chemical composition .",
    "this effect is most dramatic for models with @xmath61 and 0.004 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the previous generation of geneva tracks has been plagued by predicting a too high wc / wn ratio for metal - poor environments .",
    "the new models appear to be an improvement in this respect ( cf .",
    "[ fig27 ] ) .    the dot long - dashed line plotted for @xmath16 in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] is a model for the wr phase with the new tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 using the lower temperature limit ( @xmath58 ) and a different prescription for the mass - loss rate during the wr phase .",
    "these tracks were specifically introduced to boost the predicted number of wc stars for higher chemical composition . however ,",
    "contrary to expection , figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] suggest that these models do not change significantly the result : the wc / wn ratio is slightly lower ( dot - long dashed line ) than in the corresponding new models without @xmath14-dependent wr mass - loss rates ( dotted line ) .",
    "another often employed ratio is that of rsgs over wr stars ( r / wr ) . before exploring this ratio",
    ", it needs to be defined first .",
    "our definition is based on the work of @xcite who considers as rsgs all stars with @xmath62 , corresponding to stars of @xmath63 ( 4600 k , or late g type ) and at the same time having @xmath64 .",
    "this definition ensures that only very luminous red stars are counted and less luminous agb stars are excluded .",
    "we have implemented this definition in starburst99 to calculate the predicted number of rsgs .    as in the previous sections we are taking into account different temperature limits for the wr phase .",
    "we do not discuss models with instantaneous star formation as r / wr is indeterminate in this case .",
    "the wr and rsg phase are not overlapping in the evolutionary models , and the ratio of the two quantities would be either zero or infinity .",
    "this degeneracy results from our extreme assumption of an idealized single stellar population . in the presence of a small age spread at star birth",
    ", there is a small likelihood of both rsgs and wr stars co - existing .",
    "observations of clusters suggest few if any such examples .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the r / wr ratio for constant star formation . to understand this figure",
    ", we have to take into account the life times of massive stars , which enter when stellar populations in equilibrium are considered .",
    "the panel for @xmath38 suggests values of order unity for r / wr , with only a mild dependence on the adopted tracks or temperature definition . in the case of @xmath59 ,",
    "the spread between the different tracks becomes much larger .",
    "the difference can be up to @xmath65  dex , independently of the temperature limit for wr formation .",
    "the new tracks for this chemical composition predict a higher number wr stars ( therefore a lower r / wr ratio ) because the wr phase sets in very early close to the main sequence .",
    "the panels for @xmath11 and 0.008 should be interpreted with care because of the incompleteness of the tracks .",

    "[ fig29 ] shows our models for the ratio of rsgs over wr stars ( r / wr ) using the same layout as in fig .",
    "[ fig27 ] .",
    "symbols are the observed ratios from @xcite .",
    "the figure includes only rsgs that lie in the same areas for which surveys are complete for wrs and follow the definition of a rsg as described in section  3.2.3 .",
    "models using the old geneva tracks ( solid line ) do not match the observations , except for the lmc oxygen abundance .",
    "the new tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 do not include tracks for masses @xmath79 m@xmath2 for oxygen abundance less than solar .",
    "the mass range above 30  m@xmath2 is too small to produce a significant number of rsgs with the new tracks .",
    "therefore we generate the same theoretical values as those obtained with the old geneva tracks . for this reason",
    ", we have truncated the graphs below solar oxygen abundance .    for solar and higher oxygen abundances , the new models and the data",
    "this is the result of too few wr stars being predicted by the models .",
    "the adopted temperature limit for the wr phase does not significantly affect the results .",
    "this can be seen as seen for the models with tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 ( dot - short dashed line ) .",
    "recent results for m  33 and m  31 suggest lower oxygen abundances in hii regions by about 0.1 dex @xcite .",

    "foreground contamination can significantly affect the observed numbers . @xmath124 and @xmath125 of the bona fide rsgs seen towards the smc and lmc , respectively , are foreground objects in the survey of @xcite .",
    "another error source is the calibration of the relation to transform colors into effective temperature .",

    "[ fig30 ] the results of the study of @xcite who analyzed different samples of blue and red supergiants in associations and in extragalactic fields .",
    "the trend of these observations suggests a lower value of b / r for lower chemical composition and higher values for higher chemical composition .",
    "this result disagrees with the numbers of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the third data set in fig .  [ fig30 ] has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "their fit was derived by using a sample of 45 clusters in the milky way and 4 clusters in magellanic clouds . to obtain the long - dashed line in the plot",
    ", we assumed a value of b / r  =  30 at solar composition , which is similar to the value obtained by @xcite for galactic clusters .",
    "as before , three models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig30 ] , with the line types as in fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] . we do not plot the b / r ratio for chemical composition lower than solar for the same reason as in the previous subsection .",
    "models with the old geneva tracks do not fit the observations , whereas models with the new tracks of @xmath45 km s@xmath0 match the observations for oxygen abundance higher than solar .",

    "km s@xmath0 predict similar values as the models with the old geneva tracks . as argued before",
    ", this ratio does not depend on the minimum temperature for the wr phase .",
    "it is evident that the data are very inconsistent for subsolar chemical composition . nevertheless , the data agree in a trend of higher b / r at higher o / h . our models predict a similar trend . however , our predictions are still affected by uncertainties in the zero point for the oxygen abundance . as in the case of the wr / o ratio ,",
    "our values agree better with the observations if we adopt a lower solar oxygen abundance as shown by the dot - long dashed line in fig .",

    "progress in stellar evolution modeling is a rather discontinuous process when viewed from a `` user s '' perspective .",
    "population synthesis modelers benefit from and are at the mercy of updates and new releases by the major stellar evolution modeling groups .",
    "evolution models for massive stars have undergone dramatic improvements over the past several decades .",
    "major milestones were set with the realization of the importance of stellar mass loss , of convective processes , and of the influence of chemical composition .",
    "each time the release of a new set of stellar evolution models led to sometimes major revisions of the predictions by population synthesis models .",
    "the latest major release of revised evolution models by the geneva and padova groups occurred in the 1990s when new opacities were included and the importance metallicity - dependent mass loss was highlighted .",
    "these sets of evolution models are currently employed by virtually all population synthesis code in use .",
    "now we are in an epoch of another quantum leap in massive star evolution .",
    "the importance of stellar rotation for massive stars has been recognized and evolution calculations have been done over the past years . only very recently has a grid of evolution models with rotation been completed that is sufficiently broad and dense to be suitable for implementation .",
    "this model grid , with zams velocities of 0 and 300  km s@xmath0 , has been implemented into starburst99 .",
    "we acknowledge the shortcomings of the models presented in this paper .",
    "the limited mass coverage of the available stellar models often introduces serious biases making the comparison with observations difficult . nevertheless , some of the trends we have found in our study are significant improvements to the stellar populations study .    massive hot , blue stars tend to be more luminous and hotter when rotation is accounted for .",
    "this results from the increased convective core and larger amount of mixing reducing the surface opacities . when coupled with synthesis models ,",
    "these properties lead to significantly different population parameters . for a fixed stellar mass , a young population with rotating stars",
    "becomes more luminous at almost all wavelengths of interest .",
    "specifically , the ultraviolet to near - infrared luminosities can increase by factors of order 2 , in particular when rsgs are present . if such models are compared with observed light - to - mass ratios of young star clusters , the derived mass may become smaller by the same factor in comparison with the results of earlier studies .",
    "this has important consequences for our understanding of the low - mass end of the stellar initial mass function .",
    "the impact of the new models at wavelengths below 912   is even more dramatic .",
    "the sed in the extreme ultraviolet becomes enhanced and harder when compared with previous synthesis models .",
    "the effect is most pronounced in the ionized helium continuum below 228   due to the increased wr star contribution . even at shorter wavelengths in the neutral helium and hydrogen continua below 504 and 912   ,",
    "respectively , the changes are significant .",
    "since the lyman continuum flux increases by a factor of 2 to 3 , the derived stellar masses or star - formation rates from hydrogen recombination will decrease by the same factor .",
    "a large fraction of the increased photon output is provided by wr stars whose frequency is strongly dependent on the chemical composition .",
    "therefore the prediction recombination - line fluxes and star - formation tracers become more dependent on @xmath14 than in previous models .    given the potential impact of these new predictions",
    "it becomes crucial to perform a critical assessment of the additional assumptions that were made .",
    "the increase and hardening of the spectrum is the result of the stellar interior and atmosphere connection , which rests on the definition of the effective temperature and radius of the star .",
    "moreover , atmosphere models for wr stars must be adopted .",
    "another major area of concern are the mass - loss rates , in particular during the wr phase .",
    "the mass loss rates used in the default version of the new tracks with rotation do not include a metallicity dependence of the rates .",
    "it is also a matter of debate how the competing effects and mass loss affect the stellar properties .",
    "nevertheless , this study should be viewed as a first step in the development of more realistic and accurate models for stellar populations . should our initial results be confirmed when more mature evolutionary tracks are available , several widely used star - formation and initial mass function indicators will have to be revised .",

    "<S> we present and discuss evolutionary synthesis models for massive stellar populations generated with the starburst99 code in combination with a new set of stellar evolution models accounting for rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the new stellar evolution models were compiled from several data releases of the geneva group and cover heavy - element abundances ranging from twice solar to one fifth solar . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution models were computed for rotation velocities on the zero - age main - sequence of 0 and 300  km s@xmath0 and with the latest revision of stellar mass - loss rates . </S>",
    "<S> since the mass coverage is incomplete , in particular at non - solar chemical composition , our parameter study is still preliminary and must be viewed as exploratory . </S>",
    "<S> stellar population properties computed with starburst99 and the new evolution models show some marked differences in comparison with models obtained using earlier tracks . since individual stars now tend to be more luminous and bluer when on the blue side of the hertzsprung - russell diagram , the populations mirror this trend . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , increases by factors of two or more are found for the light - to - mass ratios at ultraviolet to near - infrared wavelengths , as well as for the output of hydrogen ionizing photons . </S>",
    "<S> if these results are confirmed once the evolution models have matured , recalibrations of certain star - formation and initial mass function indicators will be required . </S>"
