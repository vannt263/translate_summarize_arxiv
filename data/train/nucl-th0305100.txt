    "the question what is the true nature of baryon resonances has attracted considerable attention in recent modern constructions of effective field theories describing meson - baryon scattering . before the event of the quark - model",
    "it was already suggested by wyld @xcite and also by dalitz , wong and rajasekaran @xcite that a @xmath7-channel vector meson exchange model for the s - wave meson - baryon scattering problem has the potential to dynamically generate s - wave baryon resonances upon solving a coupled channel schrdinger equation . in a more modern language",
    "the @xmath7-channel exchange was rediscovered in terms of the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) interaction , the leading term of the chiral lagrangian that reproduces the first term of the vector meson exchange in an appropriate taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "this offers a unique opportunity to study the quark mass dependence of baryon resonances , one of the goals of this work .",
    "such studies may be useful to obtain a deeper understanding of baryon resonances .",
    "here we follow a scheme proposed in @xcite , based on the solution of the bethe - salpeter - equation ( bse ) , which incorporates two - body coupled channel unitarity , as other approaches  @xcite@xcite , but also insists on an approximate crossing symmetry . indeed the latter constraint led to a parameter free description of the @xmath8 and n@xmath9 resonances in terms of the wt lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to systematically unravel the su(3 ) structure of the lowest lying s - wave baryon resonances .",
    "we show that two full octets plus an additional singlet of resonances are dynamically generated within this framework . in the su(3 ) limit , with degenerate mesons and baryons , such a structure was already found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    of particular interest is the @xmath10 sector where we find a narrow state ( with a width of about 5 mev ) with a strong coupling to @xmath11 suggesting the identification with the three star resonance @xmath4 . for the latter resonance",
    "only its isospin quantum number was established experimentally .",
    "our analysis suggests the quantum numbers @xmath6 .",
    "this complements the conclusion of the recent work of ref .",
    "the authors of this reference also use a scheme based on the solution of the bse with a kernel determined by the wt term , and find just one resonance in the s - wave @xmath3 sector .",
    "the found resonance shows a large decay width and branching ratios ( br ) which are incompatible with the empirical properties of the @xmath4 resonance , and instead it was identified with the one star resonance @xmath12  @xcite . the main difference between the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and that followed here is the method used to renormalize the bse . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a three - momentum ultraviolet cutoff of natural size was introduced , though some channel dependence of its numerical value was allowed .",
    "such a procedure turns out to work remarkably well in the @xmath13 sector at low energies , providing a good description of the @xmath8 resonance , but it starts showing limitations at higher energies , where the description of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 is certainly poorer  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the procedure of  @xcite does not work in the @xmath16 sector at all , and it fails even to produce the lowest lying resonance ( n@xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "our scheme provides reasonable results in the @xmath17 sectors . in the @xmath3 sector",
    ", we also find , besides the resonance which we identify to the @xmath4 and mentioned above , a resonance with the same features as that described in @xcite , which can be identified with the one star @xmath5 resonance .",
    "we solve the coupled channel bse with an interaction kernel expanded in chiral perturbation theory as formulated in  @xcite .",
    "the solution for the coupled channel s - wave scattering amplitude , @xmath18 in the so called _ on - shell _ scheme  @xcite , can be expressed in terms of a renormalized matrix of loop functions , @xmath19 , and an effective on - shell interaction kernel , @xmath20 , as follows @xmath21 assuming the conservation of isospin and strangeness the scattering problem decouples into 9 different sectors @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) . in each sector , there are several coupled channels , for instance , the @xmath16 sector requires four coupled channels in the @xmath24 sector ( @xmath25 n , @xmath26 n , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the explicit form of the interaction kernel and the loop functions can be found in @xcite . the latter ones logarithmically diverge and one subtraction is needed to make them finite .",
    "such a freedom can be used to incorporate approximate crossing symmetry in the scheme , by the renormalization condition @xmath29 where the natural choice @xmath30 is used as explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the renormalization condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) is implemented in a straight forward manner by imposing that the renormalized loop functions @xmath19 vanish at the appropriate points @xmath31 .",
    "the renormalization condition reflects the fact that at subthreshold energies the scattering amplitudes may be evaluated in standard chiral perturbation theory with the typical expansion parameter @xmath32 with @xmath33 mev .",
    "once the available energy is sufficiently high to permit elastic two - body scattering a further typical dimensionless parameter @xmath34 arises . since this ratio is uniquely linked to two - particle reducible diagrams it is sufficient to sum those diagrams keeping the perturbative expansion of all irreducible diagrams .",
    "this is achieved by eq .",
    "( [ eq : scat - eq ] ) .",
    "the subtraction points of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) are the unique choices that protect the s - channel baryon - octet masses manifestly in the p - wave @xmath35 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the merit of the scheme @xcite lies in the property that for instance the kaon - nucleon and antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes match at @xmath36 approximately as expected from crossing symmetry .",
    "the subtraction points of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) can also be derived if one incorporates photon - baryon inelastic channels in ( [ eq : scat - eq ] ) .",
    "then additional crossing symmetry constraints arise .",
    "for instance the reaction @xmath37 , which is subject to a crossing symmetry constraint at threshold , may go via the intermediate state @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the corresponding loop function must vanish identically at @xmath39 confirming eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) . here",
    "we assume that this reaction is described by a coupled channel scattering equation ( [ eq : scat - eq ] ) where the effective on - shell interaction kernel @xmath40 is expanded in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we use the leading order ( lo ) interaction kernel @xmath20 , as determined by the wt interaction ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath42 ) is the baryon mass of the initial ( final ) channel . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowest ] ) tadpole terms , of subleading chiral order , arising from the on - shell reduction of the interaction kernel ( see ref  @xcite ) are neglected .",
    "a parameter free prediction arises if physical values for the meson and baryon masses are used .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the chiral su(3 ) symmetry of qcd that predicts the strength of the wt interaction in terms of the parameter @xmath43 already determined by the pion decay process",
    ".    we will also study the quark mass dependence of the baryon resonances that are dynamically generated by using meson and baryon masses that deviate from their chiral su(3 ) limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scat - eq ] ) .",
    "we use goldstone boson masses as determined by the gell - mann , oakes and renner ( gor ) relation @xcite in terms of the quark condensate @xmath44 , the current quark masses @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 mev ( with these values we get @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev ) .",
    "the masses of the baryon octet states are described in terms of the chiral parameters @xmath50 gev@xmath51 , @xmath52 gev@xmath51 and @xmath53 gev@xmath51 ( in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the above values require a baryon octet mass of 823 mev in the chiral limit with @xmath55 .",
    "it is well known that at this lo , all baryons and goldstone boson masses are reproduced quite accurately ( 5% ) .",
    ".experimental data , from ref .",
    "@xcite ( pdg ) , and theoretical results for several resonances . when possible we always quote pdg estimates for masses , widths and br .",
    "if the latter ones do not exist , we quote results from the most recent paper among all quoted in  @xcite .",
    "the following ratios , also given in pdg , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the @xmath58 are of interest , as well . for the case of the @xmath59 resonance , we quote the pdg pole position . from the theoretical side ,",
    "we look for poles in the srs , as defined in @xcite ( see also note  [ 22 ] ) .",
    "residues at the pole for each meson - baryon channel , give the respective couplings and branching ratios as defined in section ii.d of @xcite ( note that the @xmath60 matrix define here ( eq .  ( [ eq : scat - eq ] ) ) , coincides with the @xmath7 matrix used in @xcite ) . finally , in the last column ( @xmath61 ) we give the couplings of the resonances to each channel close to the heavy su(3 ) limit ( @xmath62 , in eq .  ( [ eq : su(3 ) ] ) ) , where all of them become bound states . besides to the states presented in the table , in the heavy su(3 ) limit there are two more bound states : additional @xmath63 and @xmath64 states .",
    "their couplings to the different channels ( we keep the ordering established in the table ) are ( 2.6,@xmath650.5,1.5,@xmath650.5 ) and ( @xmath651.1,1.5,0.7,@xmath651.1,2.1 ) respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we look for poles in the second riemann sheet ( srs ) of our amplitudes .",
    "the positions of the poles determine masses and widths of the resonances , while the residues for the different channels define the br  @xcite .",
    "we find the resonances listed in table  [ tab : res ] where only resonances with widths smaller than 250 mev are included . since for a resonance placed slightly above a threshold",
    "the br depends strongly on the exact position of the pole , we only quote coupling constants ( residues ) that are much less sensitive to the pole position . we find a remarkable success predicting rather well the bulk of the features of the four stars n(1535 ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 resonances   mev .",
    "its large [ small ] coupling to the @xmath68 [ @xmath69 channel ( @xmath70 8.5,0,0,3.3,0.3 ) and its su(3 ) trajectory , as we will see , make us to think that , despite its mass and width , it might correspond to the four star n(1650 ) resonance .",
    "it is unclear whether next - to - leading chiral corrections take the position of this pole closer to that of the physical n(1650 ) resonance .",
    "a quantitative description may require the inclusion of further inelastic channels , like @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite . ] .",
    "we also find a resonance in the @xmath64 channel , though its mass is a bit small  @xcite ) , with an appreciable influence into the physical scattering line . in the @xmath64 channel ,",
    "the pole ( @xmath731505 mev ) listed in table  [ tab : res ] is above the first three thresholds ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , but it appears in the unphysical 11000 sheet , instead of in the 11100 one ( each of the five digits counts for the number of turns around each of the branch points  @xcite ) . between the third ( @xmath77 ) and fourth ( @xmath78 ) thresholds , the 11100 sheet maps into the frs , and thus is this sheet , the one which enters into the definition of srs of ref .  @xcite . despite of this",
    ", it is indeed the narrow ( @xmath79 mev ) pole located in the unphysical 11000 sheet , with large couplings to the @xmath74 , @xmath75 and specially to the @xmath76 channels , and placed very close above the @xmath76 threshold , the one which has an important influence on the scattering for energies in the neighborhood of the @xmath76 threshold .",
    "actually , the modulus of the scattering matrix , for all open channels at these energies , presents a peak , with an appreciable gap in the first derivative ( since the pole is placed above the third threshold ( @xmath80 ) , but it is found in the 11000 sheet ) which is clearly due to the narrow pole listed in the table .",
    "there exists also a pole in the 11100 sheet ( @xmath81 ) mev .",
    "it is above the @xmath80 threshold and has a large coupling to the @xmath82 channel .",
    "this very broad pole is precisely the one quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is placed so far from the scattering line , the @xmath82 threshold ( @xmath83 mev ) is also so far from the region of about 1500 mev , that it can not compete with the narrow one found in the 11000 sheet , and it does not influence the physical scattering at all ( chiral corrections reduce its width and take its mass closer to the @xmath82 threshold indicating that it is the @xmath84 resonance  @xcite ) .",
    "there exists a third pole also in the 11000 sheet ( @xmath85 ) mev , with a large coupling to @xmath86 , and located also just above the @xmath76 threshold .",
    "its influence on physical scattering processes is limited due to the presence of the narrower pole listed in the table , but it might be identified to the @xmath87 bump  @xcite . ] . besides , in the @xmath3 sector we find two resonances , which can clearly be identified to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances .",
    "of particular interest is the signal for the @xmath4 resonance , where we find a quite small ( large ) coupling to the @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) channel , which explains the smallness of the experimental ratio , @xmath90  @xcite despite of the significant energy difference between the thresholds for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 channels .",
    "thus , this work widely improves the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , since we also address here the @xmath4 resonance , and determine its spin - parity quantum numbers ( @xmath93 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we also find a third @xmath94 resonance , not included in the pdg yet , placed also below the @xmath95 threshold and with a large coupling to the @xmath86 channel .",
    "this confirms the findings of the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the chiral dynamics of the two @xmath8 states is studied .",
    "the existence of the second @xmath8 was firstly pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .    to explore the quark mass dependence of the resonances , we increase the averaged @xmath96 and @xmath97 quark masses , but keep fixed the antikaon mass .",
    "a parameter @xmath98 is introduced in terms of which the pion mass varies as @xmath99 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : su(3)}\\ ] ] a pair @xmath100 determines the @xmath26 meson mass via the gor relation .",
    "given the su(3 ) symmetry breaking parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the masses of the baryon octet ( n(940),@xmath104,@xmath105 and @xmath106 ) are also determined . in the limit @xmath107 our su(3 )",
    "pion is as heavy as the real kaon , while when @xmath108 the physical world is recovered , up to some minor mass differences due to imprecisions of the gor and baryon splitting formulas .    for the su(3 )",
    "symmetric @xmath107 case , where all baryons ( mesons ) have a common mass @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , the @xmath60 matrix has poles in the frs ( bound states ) . for each @xmath111 channel ,",
    "the position of the poles , @xmath112 , is such that the dimensionless function @xmath113 , at @xmath114 , becomes an eigenvalue of the real and symmetric matrix @xmath115 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the latter matrices are 2,0,@xmath116 for both @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and 2,@xmath119 and 2,0,0,@xmath116 for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively . since @xmath122 is negative between @xmath123 and @xmath124 ,",
    "only negative eigenvalues can be matched .",
    "thus , we end up , with two degenerate octets of mass @xmath125 mev ( eigenvalue @xmath126 , which has a multiplicity of two in all @xmath111 sectors ) and a singlet of mass @xmath127 mev ( eigenvalue @xmath128 in the @xmath94 channel ) .",
    "thus , we confirm here the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite on the nature of the third @xmath94 listed in the table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "slightly away of the su(3 ) symmetric world ( @xmath1290.98 ) , we can determine the couplings of the baryon states to each baryon - meson channel ( last column of table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "the sum of the squared of the couplings is given by @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "we find @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show the chiral behavior of each of the members of the two octets and a singlet states .",
    "as mentioned above , for @xmath108 one recovers the physical world , though the results presented in the figure ( specially for the widths ) do not coincide with those given in the table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "the differences are produced by relative changes between the position of thresholds and the location of the resonances , due to small differences among the real meson and baryon masses ( used in table  [ tab : res ] ) and those predicted by the gor and baryon splitting formula . besides , the identification in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] of the n@xmath134 and the @xmath135 bump is subject to all uncertainties discussed so far .",
    "finally in the light su(3 ) limit with @xmath2 140 mev , the function @xmath122 , defined above , is smaller than @xmath128 in the whole interval @xmath136 $ ] and therefore bound states do no exist .",
