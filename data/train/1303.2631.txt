    "the theory of filtering considers the estimation of the system state from noisy and/or partial observations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for quantum systems ,",
    "filtering theory was initiated in the 1980s by belavkin in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "belavkin makes use of the operational formalism of davies  @xcite , which is a precursor to the theory of quantum filtering .",
    "he has also realized that due to the unavoidable back - action of quantum measurements , the theory of filtering plays a fundamental role in quantum feedback control ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of quantum filtering was independently developed in the physics community , particularly in the context of quantum optics , under the name of quantum trajectory theory  @xcite .",
    "the basic model used to derive filtering equations for a quantum system uses a system - probe interaction . a quantum system , whose state needs to be estimated , is made to interact with a probe and the state of the system becomes entangled with that of the probe .",
    "after this interaction , an observable is measured on the probe and this measurement outcome is used to estimate the state of the system .",
    "the commutativity of any system observable with any probe observable is used to develop a recursive markov filtering equation for the system observables ( see e.g.  @xcite for an excellent tutorial ) .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is the hilbert space corresponding to the system whose state needs to be estimated and @xmath1 is the hilbert space of the probe . according to the classical von neumann definition , any probe observable is a self - adjoint operator @xmath2 on @xmath1 ; the measurement of such an observable results in an outcome that is ( stochastically ) an eigenvalue of @xmath2 , and the probe state after measurement gets projected onto the corresponding eigenspace of @xmath2 .",
    "as far as we are aware , all discussions on quantum filtering theory so far have assumed that the probe undergoes such a von neumann measurement , also called projective measurement or projection valued measure ( pvm ) .",
    "however , a more modern treatment of quantum measurement theory shows that the most general possible quantum measurements that one can perform are the so - called positive operator valued measures ( povms ) , of which von neumann measurements are merely a special case where all the operators are commuting projections  @xcite .",
    "see section  [ sec : revpovm ] for a brief overview of povms .",
    "povms on @xmath1 can be reformulated as the restriction to @xmath1 of a pvm on a larger space . however , there is no canonical pvm that corresponds uniquely to a given povm .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that the state of a quantum system after a povm measurement is not uniquely determined as a function of the povm . to remedy the latter situation , davies  (",
    "* ch.3 ) has shown that one can associate a ( non - unique ) instrument to any povm , which determines a completely positive map that specifies the state after measurement conditioned on the measurement outcome .",
    "however , there is again no canonical instrument that corresponds to a given povm .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to uniquely specify the post - measurement state for a given povm measurement outcome unless the instrument associated with the measurement is known . as stated by nielsen and chuang  @xcite , ``",
    "povms are best viewed as [ ... ] providing the simplest means by which one can study general measurement statistics , without the necessity for knowing the post - measurement state . '' as such they are a minimal description of quantum measurements , so one can hope that the povm formalism leads to more concise and fast filtering equations , suited for ( possibly analog ) implementation in real - time quantum feedback experiments .",
    "there are other reasons to develop a povm - based filtering theory that shortcuts the lift to pvms in larger spaces .",
    "for one , once the povm theory is available it can be more natural to use , as several practical measurement setups are based on povms , such as e.g.  approximate position / momentum measurements  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) or phase measurements  @xcite . in some infinite - dimensional situations there",
    "can even be conceptual barriers to a pvm viewpoint . indeed , with phase measurements after much investigation there is still no universal agreement on an acceptable pvm  @xcite .",
    "finally , regarding system identification , the povm associated with any experimental setup can ( at least conceptually ) be directly deduced from measurement outcomes ; in contrast , in order to ascertain the associated instrument it is necessary to analyze the post - measurement state of the system ( for more details see section  [ sub : estpovm ] ) .",
    "this is not generally feasible in practical experimental setups where often the measurements destroy the quantum state ( e.g. photo - detection ) and/or non - measurably alter it due to interaction with the environment .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a discrete time filtering equation for the system state conditioned on povm measurements performed on a probe . after reviewing the povm formalism ( section [ sec : revpovm ] )",
    ", we provide a general theory about ( strongly ) commuting instruments that are associated to povms ( section [ sec : commins ] ) .",
    "we then generalize the filtering framework of @xcite from pvms to povms .",
    "first section [ sec : condexp ] illustrates povm - specific difficulties in the conditional expectation approach .",
    "section [ sec : condprob ] then defines conditional probabilities for povms . in the setup consisting of a probe",
    "coupled to a target system , any ( physically reasonable ) instrument associated with a povm acting only on the probe , strongly commutes with any instrument associated with a povm acting only on the target system . in section [ sec : filtering ] we show how this allows to define a filtering equation for the system state conditioned on probe povm measurement outcomes .",
    "this filtering equation is only a function of the observed probe povm and does not depend on the associated instrument nor other povm elements .",
    "the povm formalism is a standard part of most modern quantum information textbooks .",
    "we briefly review it here and refer the interested reader to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for more details .    consider a quantum system with hilbert space @xmath3 , i.e.  the system state is given by a density operator @xmath4 which is a unit - trace nonnegative self - adjoint linear operator on @xmath3 .",

    "this allows one to describe measurement apparatuses with outcomes that are physically e.g.  multi - dimensional or on a manifold topology like the circle or sphere , which is not possible with standard von neumann measurements .",
    "the latter are indeed equivalent to a special case of povms called _ projection valued measures ( pvms ) _ , which require that @xmath13 is a closed subset of the real line and that the range of @xmath29 only consists of commuting projections .",
    "the unique correspondence between pvms ( @xmath9 ) and self - adjoint operators describing von neumann measurements ( @xmath11 ) is obtained through by setting @xmath33 for each @xmath34 .",

    "<S> the objective of this work is to develop a recursive , discrete time quantum filtering equation for a system that interacts with a probe , on which measurements are performed according to the positive operator valued measures ( povms ) framework . </S>",
    "<S> povms are the most general measurements one can make on a quantum system and although in principle they can be reformulated as projective measurements on larger spaces , for which filtering results exist , a direct treatment of povms is more natural and can simplify the filter computations for some applications . hence we formalize the notion of strongly commuting ( davies ) instruments which allows one to develop joint measurement statistics for povm type measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to prove the existence of conditional povms , which is essential for the development of a filtering equation . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that under generally satisfied assumptions , knowing the observed probe povm operator is sufficient to uniquely specify the quantum filtering evolution for the system . </S>"
