    "planets that transit their host stars play a special role in our understanding of the characteristics of exoplanets : their transit allows us to accurately determine the radius and the orbital inclination of the planet from the photometric light curve so that an actual mass can be derived from a spectroscopic orbit of the host star .",
    "the mass and radius enable us to infer a bulk composition of the planet , and although there are degeneracies associated with the bulk composition , it allows us to put constraints on models of planetary structure and formation theories .",
    "the incredible diversity of the over 60 discovered transiting planets , ranging from dense planets with a higher mean density than that of copper to strongly irradiated puffed - up planets with a mean density comparable to that of corkwood , have baffled the exoplanet community , and no unified theory has been established to explain all the systems consistently . transiting extrasolar planet ( tep ) discoveries are primarily the result of dedicated ground  based searches , such as superwasp @xcite , hatnet @xcite , tres @xcite and xo @xcite , and space - borne searches , such as corot @xcite and kepler @xcite .",
    "since its commissioning in 2003 , the hungarian - made automated telescope network ( hatnet ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey has been one of the major contributors to the discoveries of teps .",
    "hatnet has discovered over a dozen teps since 2006 by surveying bright stars ( @xmath17mag ) in the northern hemisphere and has now covered approximately 11% of the northern sky .",
    "hatnet consists of six wide field automated telescopes ; four of these are located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) in arizona , and two on the roof of the submillimeter array hangar ( sma ) of the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) in hawaii . in this paper we report a new tep discovery of hatnet , called hat - p-16b .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in",
    "we summarize the observations , including the photometric detection , and follow - up observations .",
    "in we describe the analysis of the data , such as the stellar parameter determination ( ) , ruling out blend scenarios ( ) , and global modeling of the data ( ) .",
    "we discuss our findings in .",
    "the transits of hat - p-16b were detected with the hat-6 and hat-7 telescopes in arizona and the hat-8 and hat-9 telescopes in hawaii .",
    "the star gsc  2792 - 01700 lies in the intersection of 3 separate hatnet fields internally labeled as 123 , 163 and 164 .",
    "field 123  was observed with an @xmath18 filter and a 2k@xmath192k ccd , while fields 163 and 164 were observed through @xmath20 filters with 4k@xmath194k ccds .",
    "all three fields were observed with a 5 minute exposure time and at a 5.5 minute cadence in the period between july 2007 and september 2008 during which over 12,000 exposures were gathered for the three fields .",
    "each image contains between 27,000 and 76,000 stars down to a magnitude of @xmath21 for field 123 and @xmath22 for fields 163 and 164 , yielding a photometric precision for the brightest stars in the field of @xmath23mmag for field 123 and @xmath24mmag for fields 163 and 164 .",
    "frame calibration , astrometry and aperture photometry were done in an identical way to recent hatnet tep discoveries , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting light curves  were decorrelated ( cleaned of trends ) using the external parameter decorrelation technique in `` constant '' mode ( epd ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the light curves were searched for periodic box - like signals using the box least - squares method ( bls ; see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a significant signal was detected in the light curve of gsc  2792 - 01700 ( also known as 2mass  00381756 + 4227470 ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; j2000 ; @xmath27 ; @xcite ) , with a depth of @xmath28mmag , and a period of @xmath29days .",
    "the dip had a relative duration ( first to last contact ) of @xmath30 , corresponding to a total duration of @xmath31  hr ( see figure  [ fig : hatnet ] ) .",
    "transiting planet candidates found by ground - based , wide - field photometric surveys must undergo a rigorous vetting process to eliminate the many astrophysical systems mimicking transiting planets ( called false positives ) , the rate of which has proved to be much higher than the occurrence of true planets ( 10 to 20 times higher ) . low signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) high - resolution reconnaissance spectra are used to extract stellar parameters such as effective temperature , gravity , metallicity and rotational and radial velocities to rule out these false positives .",
    "examples of false positives which are discarded are eclipsing binaries and triple systems .",
    "the latter can be either hierarchical or chance alignment systems where the light of the eclipsing pair of stars is diluted by the light of a third brighter star .",
    "rapidly rotating and/or hot host stars whose spectrum is unsuitable for high precision velocity work are also discarded .",
    "we acquired @xmath32  reconnaissance spectra with the cfa digital speedometer ( ds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the flwo 1.5 m tillinghast reflector between december 2008 and january 2009 .",
    "the extracted modest precision radial velocities gave a mean absolute rv=@xmath33@xmath34 with an rms of @xmath35 , which is consistent with no detectable rv variation .",
    "the stellar parameters derived from the spectra @xcite , including the effective temperature @xmath36 , surface gravity @xmath37 ( log cgs ) and projected rotational velocity @xmath38 , correspond to a f8  dwarf",
    ".      the high significance of the transit detection by hatnet , together with the stellar spectral type and small rv variations encouraged us to gather high  resolution , high s / n spectra to determine the orbit of the system .",
    "we have taken 21 spectra between august and october 2009 using the fibre  fed chelle spectrograph ( fies ) at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at la palma , spain @xcite .",
    "we used the medium and the high  resolution fibers ( @xmath39 projected diameter ) with resolving powers of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath42 .",
    "recently , fies has also been used to obtain a spectroscopic orbit for one of the first kepler planets , namely kepler-7b @xcite .",
    "we also used the hires instrument @xcite on the keck  i telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we obtained 6 exposures with an iodine cell , plus 1 iodine - free template with keck - i / hires .",
    "the observations were made on 6 nights between 2009 july 3 and 2009 october 29 .",
    "the width of the spectrometer slit used on hires was @xmath43 , resulting in a resolving power of @xmath44 , with a wavelength coverage of @xmath45 .",
    "the iodine gas absorption cell was used to superimpose a dense forest of @xmath46 lines on the stellar spectrum and establish an accurate wavelength fiducial ( see * ? ? ?",
    "relative rvs in the solar system barycentric frame were derived as described by @xcite , incorporating full modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the instrumental profile .",
    "the final rv data and their errors ( for both instruments ) are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "the folded data are plotted in figure  [ fig : rvbis ] .",
    "the systemic gamma velocities ( that are the result of the global modeling , as laid out in ) have been subtracted to ensure a common zero  point .",
    "the best orbital fit ( see ) is superimposed in the figure .",
    "[ ht ]    since this is the first time the not has been used to determine the orbit of a hatnet planet , we describe briefly the extraction of the radial velocities .",
    "we have built a custom pipeline to rectify and cross correlate spectra from chelle spectrographs with the goal of providing very precise radial velocities .",
    "the first step in the extraction process is to remove the bias level and crop the raw images . to effectively remove cosmic rays ,",
    "the observation is divided into three separate exposures , which enables us to combine the raw images using median filtering , removing virtually all cosmic rays .",
    "we use a flat field to trace the chelle orders and we rectify the spectra by using the `` optimal extraction '' algorithm @xcite . the blaze function is determined by fitting cubic splines to a combined high s / n flat field exposure and is saved separately in order to preserve the original flux in the stellar exposure . by dividing the normalized blaze function into the rectified flat field spectrum , we can determine the pixel to pixel variations and correct for these . the scattered light in the two  dimensional raw image",
    "is determined and removed by masking out the signal in the chelle orders and fitting the inter ",
    "order scattered light flux with a two  dimensional polynomial .    thorium argon ( thar ) calibration images are obtained through the science fiber before and after the stellar observation .",
    "the two calibration images are combined to form the basis for the fiducial wavelength calibration .",
    "we have determined that the best wavelength solution is achieved by choosing an exposure time that saturates the strong argon lines but enhances the forest of weaker thorium lines .",
    "fies is not a vacuum spectrograph and is only temperature controlled to @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , the radial velocity errors are dominated by our limited ability to correct for shifts due to pressure , humidity and temperature variations .",
    "in order to successfully remove these large variations ( @xmath48 ) , it is critical that the thar light travels through the same light path as the stellar light and thus acts as an effective proxy to remove these variations .",
    "we have therefore chosen to interleave the stellar observation between two thar exposures instead of using the simultaneous thar technique , which may not exactly describe the induced shifts in the science fiber .",
    "the centers of the thar lines are found by fitting a gaussian function to the line profiles and a two dimensional fifth order legendre polynomial is used to describe the wavelength solution .",
    "once the spectra have been extracted , a multi  order cross correlation is performed order by order .",
    "first , the spectra are interpolated to a common oversampled log wavelength scale with the same monotonic wavelength increment in all orders .",
    "a high and low pass filter is applied in the fourier domain and the ends of the spectra are apodized with a cosine bell function .",
    "the orders are cross correlated using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) and the cross correlation function ( ccf ) for each order is co  added .",
    "this automatically weights each order by its flux , giving more weight to the orders with more photons .",
    "this ccf peak is fitted with a gaussian function to determine its center .",
    "the internal precision is estimated by finding the radial velocity for each order and the rv error is thus @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the rv of the individual orders and @xmath51 is the number of orders . for the final radial velocities ,",

    ", @xmath52 and @xmath53 frames were acquired with a cadence of @xmath54 and @xmath55 seconds ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 seconds of exposure time ) in the sloan @xmath58 band , respectively .",
    "the reduction of the images , including frame calibration , astrometry , and photometry were performed as described in @xcite .",

    "we could now use the effective temperature and the surface gravity found by sme to determine other stellar parameters , such as the mass , @xmath79 , and radius , @xmath80 , using model isochrones .",
    "however , there may be strong correlations between effective temperature , gravity and metallicity in the spectroscopic determination of these parameters . also , the effect of @xmath81  on the spectral line shapes is typically subtle , and as a result @xmath81  is generally a rather poor luminosity indicator .",
    "instead , we used the @xmath82 , the normalized semimajor axis ( related to @xmath83 , the mean stellar density ) , which can be derived directly from the light curves  @xcite .",

    "this was done for each of 15,000 simulations .",
    "parameter combinations corresponding to unphysical locations in the h - r diagram ( 4% of the trials ) were ignored , and replaced with another randomly drawn parameter set .",
    "the resulting stellar parameters and their uncertainties were determined from the _ a posteriori _ distributions obtained in this way .",
    "in particular , the resulting surface gravity of @xmath89 is somewhat different from that derived in the initial sme analysis , which is not surprising in view of the possible strong correlations among @xmath84 , @xmath85 $ ] , and the surface gravity .",
    "therefore , in a second iteration we adopted this value of @xmath81  and held it fixed in a new sme analysis , adjusting only @xmath84 , @xmath85 $ ] , and @xmath90 .",

    "@xcite argue that for multiple systems with a hot jupiter as the inner planet , secular excitation of the eccentricity by companion planets could explain the non ",
    "zero eccentricity of these systems .",
    "thus the origin of the eccentricity of hat - p-16b  remains unclear .    with a stellar rotation of @xmath231  @xmath34and an impact parameter of @xmath232 ,",
