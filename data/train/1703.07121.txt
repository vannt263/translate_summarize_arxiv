    "<S> we present new high - resolution alma ( @xmath0co @xmath1=1@xmath20  and @xmath1= 2 - 1 ) and carma ( @xmath3co  and @xmath0co @xmath1=1@xmath20 ) observations of two luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) : arp  55 and ngc  2623 . </S>",

    "<S> we perform a bayesian likelihood non - local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis to constrain the molecular gas physical conditions such as temperature , column and volume densities and the [ @xmath3co]/[@xmath0co ]  abundance ratio . for arp  55 , an early / intermediate staged merger , the line measurements are consistent with cold ( @xmath4 10 - 20  k ) , dense ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) molecular gas . for ngc  2623 , the molecular gas is warmer ( @xmath4 110  k ) and less dense ( @xmath4 10@xmath8 @xmath7 ) . since arp  55 is an early / intermediate stage merger while ngc  2623 is a merger remnant , the difference in physical conditions may be an indicator of merger stage . comparing the temperature and volume density of several lirgs shows that the molecular gas , averaged over @xmath4kiloparsec scale , of advanced mergers is in general warmer and less dense than early / intermediate stage mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the [ @xmath3co]/[@xmath0co ]  abundance ratio of ngc  2623 is unusually high ( @xmath5250 ) when compared to the milky way ; however , it follows a trend seen with other lirgs in literature . </S>",
    "<S> this high [ @xmath3co]/[@xmath0co ]  value is very likely due to stellar nucleosynthesis enrichment of the interstellar medium . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> arp  55 has a more galactic [ @xmath3co]/[@xmath0co ]  value with the most probable [ @xmath3co]/[@xmath0co ]  value being 20 - 30 . </S>",

    "<S> since arp 55 is an early / intermediate , this suggests that the transition from a galactic conversion factor to a lirg value happens at an even earlier merger stage . </S>"
