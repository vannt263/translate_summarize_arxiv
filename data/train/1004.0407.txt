    "the kdv equation may be obtained in the leading order approximation of an asymptotic perturbation theory for one - dimensional nonlinear waves under the assumptions of weak nonlinearity ( small amplitude ) and weak dispersion ( long waves ) .",
    "the initial value problem of the kdv equation has been extensively studied by means of the method of inverse scattering transform ( ist ) .",
    "it is then well - known that a general initial data decaying rapidly for large spatial variable evolves into a sum of individual solitons and some weak dispersive wave trains separated away from solitons ( see for examples , @xcite ) .    in 1970 , kadomtsev and petviashvili @xcite proposed a two - dimensional dispersive wave equation to study the stability of one soliton solution of the kdv equation under the influence of weak transversal perturbations .",
    "this equation is now referred to as the kp equation , and considered to be a prototype of the integrable nonlinear dispersive wave equations in two dimensions .",
    "the kp equation can be also represented in the lax form , that is , there exists a pair of linear equations associated with the eigenvalue problem and the evolution of the eigenfunctions .",
    "however , unlike the case of the kdv equation , the method of ist based on the pair of linear equations does not seem to provide a practical method for the initial value problem with non - periodic waves considered in this paper . at the present time",
    ", there is no feasible analytic method to solve the initial value problem of the kp equation with initial waves having line - solitons in the far field .    in this paper",
    ", we study this type of the initial value problem of the kp equation by means of the direct numerical simulation .",
    "in particular , we consider the following two cases of the initial waves : in the first case , the initial wave consists of two semi - infinite line - solitons forming a v - shape pattern , and in the second case , the initial wave is given by a linear combination of two infinite line - solitons forming x - shape .",
    "those initial waves have been considered in the study of the generation of large amplitude waves in shallow water @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that the solutions of the initial value problem with those initial waves asymptotically _ converge _ to some of the exact soliton solutions found in @xcite .",
    "this implies a separation of the ( exact ) soliton solution from the dispersive radiations in the similar manner as in the kdv case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : kp ] , we provide a brief summary of the soliton solutions of the kp equation and the classification theorem obtained in @xcite for those soliton solutions as a background necessary for the present study . in particular , we introduce the parametrization of each soliton solution with a _ chord diagram _ which represents a derangement of the permutation group , i.e. permutation without fixed point . in section [ sec : exact ] , we present several exact soliton solutions , and describe some properties of those solutions .",
    "each of those soliton solutions has @xmath2 numbers of line - solitons in a far field on the two - dimensional plane , say in @xmath3 , and @xmath4 numbers of line - solitons in the far field of the opposite side , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "this type of soliton solution is referred to as an @xmath6-soliton solution . here",
    "we consider those solitons with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in section [ sec : numerics ] , we describe the numerical scheme used in this paper , which is based on the pseudo - spectral method combined with the window technique @xcite .",
    "the window technique is especially used to compute our non - periodic problem which is essentially an infinite domain problem .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : result ] , we present the numerical results of the initial value problems with v- and x - shape initial waves , and show that the solutions asymptotically converge to some of those exact solutions discussed in section [ sec : exact ] .",
    "the convergence is in the sense of locally defined @xmath9-sense with the usual norm , i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a compact set which covers the main structure describing the ( resonant ) interactions in the solution .",
    "we also propose a method to identify an exact solution for a given initial wave with v- or x - shape pattern based on the chord diagrams introduced in the classification theory .",
    "here we give a brief summary of the recent result of the classification theorem for soliton solutions of the kp equation ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "in particular , each soliton solution is then parametrized by a chord diagram which represents a unique element of the permutation group .",
    "we use this parametrization throughout the paper .",
    "the kp equation is a two - dimensional nonlinear dispersive wave equation given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 etc .",
    "let us express the solution in the form , @xmath14 where the function @xmath15 is called the _ tau _",
    "function , which plays a central role in the kp theory . in this paper",
    ", we consider a class of the solutions , where each solution can be expressed by @xmath16 in the wronskian determinant form @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath20 . here",
    "the functions @xmath21 form a set of linearly independent solutions of the linear equations , @xmath22 ( the fact that ( [ tau ] ) with ( [ wronskian ] ) gives a solution of the kp equation is well - known and the proof can be found in several places , e.g. see @xcite . ) the solution of those equations can be expressed in the fourier transform , @xmath23 with an appropriate contour @xmath24 in @xmath25 and the measure @xmath26 . in particular",
    ", we consider a finite dimensional solution with @xmath27 with @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 thus this type of solution is characterized by the parameters @xmath30 and the @xmath31 matrix @xmath32 of rank@xmath33 , that is , we have @xmath34 note that @xmath35 gives a basis of @xmath36 and @xmath37 spans an @xmath38-dimensional subspace of @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the @xmath39-matrix can be identified as a point on the real grassmann manifold gr@xmath40 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath41 be the set of all @xmath31 matrices of rank @xmath38 .",
    "then gr@xmath40 can be expressed as @xmath42 where gl@xmath43 is the general linear group of rank @xmath38 .",
    "this is saying that other basis @xmath44 for any @xmath45 spans the same subspace .",
    "notice here that the freedom in the @xmath39-matrix with gl@xmath43 can be fixed by expressing @xmath39 in the reduced row echelon form ( rref ) .",
    "we then assume throughout this paper that the @xmath39-matrix is in the rref , and show that the @xmath39-matrix plays a crucial role in our discussion on the asymptotic behavior of the initial value problem .    now using the binet - cauchy lemma for the determinant , the @xmath15-function of ( [ tau ] )",
    "can be expressed in the form , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 minor of the @xmath39-matrix with @xmath38 columns marked by @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 from the formula ( [ b - c ] ) , one can see that for a given @xmath39-matrix ,    * if a column of @xmath39 has only zero elements , then the exponential term @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the column index never appear in the @xmath15-function , and * if a row of @xmath39 has only the pivot as non - zero element , then @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the row index can be factored out from the @xmath15-function , i.e. @xmath54 has no contribution to the solution .",
    "we then say that an @xmath39-matrix with no such cases is _ irreducible _ , because the @xmath15-function with reducible matrix can be obtained by a matrix with smaller size .",
    "we are also interested in non - singular solutions .",
    "since the solution is given by @xmath56 , the non - singular solutions are obtained by imposing the non - negativity condition on the minors , @xmath57 this condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for the non - singularity of the solution .",
    "we call a matrix having the condition ( [ nnc ] ) _ totally non - negative _ matrix .",
    "let us here present the simplest solution , called one _ line - soliton _ solution , and introduce several notations to describe the solution .",
    "a line - soliton solution is obtained by a @xmath15-function with two exponential terms , i.e. the case @xmath58 and @xmath59 in ( [ nm ] ) : with the @xmath39-matrix of the form @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 the parameter @xmath62 in the @xmath39-matrix must be @xmath63 for a _ non - singular _ solution ( i.e. totally non - negative @xmath39-matrix ) , and it determines the location of the soliton solution . since @xmath64 leads to a trivial solution , we consider only @xmath65 ( i.e. irreducible @xmath39-matrix ) .",
    "then the solution @xmath66 gives @xmath67 thus the solution is located along the line @xmath68 .",
    "we here emphasize that the line - soliton appears at the boundary of two regions , in each of which either @xmath69 or @xmath70 becomes the dominant exponential term , and because of this we also call this soliton @xmath71$]-soliton solution ( or soliton of @xmath71$]-type ) .",
