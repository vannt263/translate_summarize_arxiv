    "the discovery of extrasolar planets by radial velocity measurements has provided the first dynamical characteristics of planets ( orbital elements and mass ) . the next step will be to investigate physical characteristics of extrasolar ( albedo , temperature , radius etc . ) and their surroundings . among the latter are planetary rings",
    ". coming space or ground - based high - contrast imaging instruments will be able to provide the first image of an unresolved extrasolar planet , in the thermal infrared or in the visible light .",
    "the emitted thermal infrared light from the planet should show no phase effect assuming the planet is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "but the reflected visible light will vary with phase angle , as should be shown by a broad - band photometric follow - up of the planet during its orbital motion .",
    "we thus argue that it is of interest to study how the presence of a ring around a planet would influence its brightness as a function of its orbital position .",
    "this paper shows a few examples ( more in @xcite ) of how the reflected light curve of a ringed planet is different from that of a ringless planet , thus revealing the presence of the ring .",
    "the specific signature of a ring has been already mentioned and briefly qualitatively discussed ( @xcite ) , but here a more quantitative model is considered , in which the basic optical properties of the planet and the ring are taken into account , together with all geometrical parameters describing the ringed planet .",
    "although all giant planets of the solar system have rings , ringlets or arclets , those of saturn are by far the brightest .",
    "but at methane absorption wavelengths , giants planets are fainter than in the visible and their rings appear relatively brighter , increasing their detectability . for uranus for example ,",
    "the rings appear with a brightness comparable to the planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "even the earth might have been surrounded by a ring , but only during @xmath0 to several @xmath1 years ( see @xcite for a detailed bibliography ) .",
    "although saturn rings are probably younger than the planet itself , @xmath2 years ( @xcite ) , i.e. one order of magnitude younger than the planet , we consider that it remains relevant to look for rings around extrasolar planets , at least for giant planets .",
    "to compute the light curve of the ringed planet as a function of the orbital phase angle , we build radiance maps of the object , for a given set of geometrical parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the planet is an isotropic ( lambertian ) gray spherical light diffuser .",
    "the ring is a planar , homogeneous and anisotropic ( non - lambertian ) gray scattering layer .",
    "the ring brightness is estimated by assuming only single scattering in the ring . mutual lighting",
    "( i.e. planet - shine on the ring , or ring - shine on the planet ) is not modeled , but mutual shadowing is computed quite easily .",
    "all curves are normalized to the flux of a ringless planet seen in quadrature .",
    "let s first consider the simple geometrical configuration where an extrasolar system is observed pole - on .",
    "this configuration means that the planet always remains in quadrature , thus showing always the same phase . for a ringless planet , it means that its brightness remains constant during the full orbit ( assumed circular ) .",
    "now for a ringed planet with non - zero obliquity , the ring alternately shows its illuminated and dark side , moreover it projects its shadow on the planet .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig01 ] showing strong slope changes at the equinoxes .",
    "this dichotomy of the light curves is due to the ring being alternately seen in reflection and in transmission .",
    "this is a clear ring signature which is often well visible in other geometrical configurations .    ) .",

    "the light curves at both wavelengths can be significantly different , as shown in figure [ fig02 ] . in the methane band ,",
    "stronger slope changes occur at the equinoxes , here again due to the two observation regimes of the ring , either seen reflecting or transmitting the light .",
    "note that when the ring disappears at the equinoxes , the object spectrum may be the spectrum of the planet only , but it can also be composite if a part of the planet is seen through the unilluminated ring .    .",

    "but the ratio of the reflected light from the planet over the stellar flux gives a value of the planetary radius ( @xcite , 2002 ) .",
    "the ring significant flux contribution can lead to an overestimation of the planet radius by a factor of 10 . if the mass of the planet is known ( by radial velocity for instance )",
    ", the overestimated planet radius would lead to an underestimated planet density .",
    "thus a planet with a very low apparent density could be a signature of a ring .",
    "moreover , the planet radius can in principle also be deduced from its infrared thermal flux @xmath20 , assuming the planet temperature has been inferred from the matching of a planck function to the observed thermal spectrum ( @xcite , 2002 ) .",
    "the disagreement between the planet radii at visible and infrared wavelengths could thus be another signature of a ring .",
    "the examples shown demonstrate that a ring around an extrasolar planet significantly affects the reflected light curve of an extrasolar planet during its orbital motion .",
    "a ring could thus be detected , although both planet and ring would obviously remain unresolved .",
    "this may be achieved simply by a photometric monitoring of the planet light .",
    "we identified the following signatures , which would require only moderate photometric accuracy to be observed ( around @xmath21 mag ) :                although future space missions studies concentrate mainly on infrared instruments for technical and scientific reasons , this work shows the additional interest of shorter wavelengths ( visible band ) for extrasolar planet characterization .",
