    "the periodic evolutions of the orbits of a binary system can be described differently by some characteristic orbital time spans that pertain the crossing of different locations in the sky : the draconitic , anomalistic and sidereal orbital periods , which are measured according to two consecutive crossings of the lines of the nodes , periapsis , and a given reference direction in the sky plane , respectively  @xcite . in the purely keplerian case ,",
    "all of them coincide , while the degeneration is removed when additional accelerations with respect to the newtonian monopole are present in the equations of motion .",

    "similarly to section  [ subsec : ltsec ] , also in this case we explore all the quadrupole corrections of periods as functions of the spatial orientation of the spin axis of the galactic mbh for the star s2 and s0 - 102 .",
    "the results are showed in figure  [ s2s0102_q_periods ] .",
    "we can see that the period corrections due to the quadrupole have two local minima and two maxima in the @xmath122 plane , as it can be inferred from equation  [ eq : q ] itself . for s2 ,",
    "the effects are within the ranges @xmath148 , while for s0 - 102 we have@xmath149 .",
    "thus , the period corrections by quadrupole - induced effects are about orders of magnitude smaller than those of the kerr - type , making the detections of them quite challenging .",
    "s - stars orbiting the mbh much closer than the currently known ones are expected to be revealed by future telescopes .",
    "their observables , i.e. , the apparent proper motions and the redshifts , can be collected with high accuracy by such future facilities which can be used to reconstruct the orbital elements of the target star .",
    "although the projected line of sight distance of the star with respect to the mbh can not be directly measured , it can be inferred by the accelerations of the proper motions and the redshift : @xmath150 , where @xmath151 , @xmath152 are the accelerations in the @xmath153 directions , and @xmath154 represents the line of sight direction . from such measurements , it is straightforward to obtain the corresponding orbital elements and the three periods according to the measured true anomaly , argument of latitude and true longitude .",
    "if the three periods are not identical to each other , it points towards a strong evidence of the need of the general relativity corrections .",
    "we notice that these measured periods are combinations of both the newtonian and other gr corrections discussed in section  [ risultati ] . as we have showed , the period corrections due to the quadrupole momentum amount to about @xmath155 s even though the s - star can be as closed as about @xmath156 from the mbh . considering that a single exposure time of the s - stars could be comparable to or longer than such time spans , in the gc environment",
    "the quadrupole - induced period corrections may not be well constrained so to be ignorable .",
    "if the orbital elements are measured with considerable accuracy , the sum of the period corrections , given by equation  [ eq : ge ] ,  [ eq : lt ] or the numerical simulations , can then be used to be compared with the measured three types of periods such that the spin of the mbh is determined . by such an implementation",
    ", the contributions of kerr effects and the schwarzschild - type effects are separated , providing independent constraints on the relativistic effects along with their orbital precession .",
    "furthermore , the constraints could be improved if the three periods can be measured for more than a single s - star .",
    "however , the orbital elements in equation  [ eq : ge ] ,  [ eq : lt ] and  [ eq : q ] may not be clearly determined as they are defined according to the local state vectors which can not be measured directly .",
    "the practical measurement of them , and also the related period corrections by the method mentioned above , may need to be implemented in a more complex framework .",
    "for example , the gr one which incorporates the propagation of light from the star to the observer , and also includes other complexities that are needed to accurately describe the observed motion of the star around the mbh .",
    "we defer such a realization and comprehensive studies to future works .",
    "we also notice that the background stars can also induce newtonian perturbations on the orbital periods  @xcite .",
    "their most peculiar signature consists of the fact that the orbital period of the s - stars changes in every revolution  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that they should appear different with respect to those due to the general relativistic effects discussed here , which strongly suggests that these two effects are separable .",
    "in presence of post - keplerian accelerations , of both newtonian and post - newtonian origin , the degeneracy affecting the draconitic , anomalistic and sidereal orbital periods of a gravitationally bound two - body system is removed .",
    "analytical calculations of the corresponding post - keplerian corrections , mainly in the small eccentricity approximation , appeared recently in the literature .",
    "the extensive numerical simulations performed in the present work , applied to various orbital configurations of a target s  star orbiting the black hole which is supposed to lurk in sgr a@xmath0 at the center of the galaxy , confirmed the previous results by extending them to highly elliptic orbits .",
    "it turned out that , for a target star with @xmath157 au and @xmath5 , the post - newtonian schwarzschild - type acceleration causes corrections as large as about @xmath158 , the lense - thirring ones are up to @xmath159 , while the quadrupole - driven ones amount to @xmath160 .",
    "furthermore , we considered also the currently known s2 and s0 - 102 stars by numerically investigating their periods .",
    "in particular , the schwarzschild - type anomalistic corrections agreed well with the values provided by the analytical formulas in the literature ; furthermore , the lense - thirring and quadrupole - induced orbital time intervals were studied as functions of the spatial orientation of the spin axis of the hosting black hole .    as possible directions for future work ,",
    "an extension of the previously published analytical results to large values of the eccentricity would be desirable in view of a comparison with the present numerical results .",
    "furthermore , we stress that our results have a general validity , not being restricted just to the galactic center ; they can be straightforwardly extended also to other astronomical and astrophysical scenarios , like , e.g. , exoplanets , which could turn out to be promising in view of future potential detections .",
    "finally , the approach followed here can be extended , in principle , also to various modified models of gravity which , in the recent years , have come out to center stage . in view of their huge amount , dealing with even a fraction of them is outside the scopes of the present paper . indeed , a comprehensive treatment of their impact on the orbital periods would deserve one or more dedicated papers , both of analytical and numerical nature .",
    "whatever the post - keplerian effect one is interested in , it is hoped that the present analysis may prompt dedicated studies by astronomers aimed to testing the actual measurability of the orbital periods considered here and determining the associated accuracy .",
