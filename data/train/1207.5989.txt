    "_ topological insulators _ are materials that behave as ordinary insulators in the bulk , in that they exhibit an excitation gap , whereas the edge has robust , gapless modes .",
    "they have been theoretically predicted as a class @xcite and as a specific compound @xcite , in which the effect was then observed @xcite . in analogy with quantum hall ( qh ) systems , the presence of edge states is a robust property of the system , in that it is stable under moderate changes of parameters . that calls for an explanation in terms of topological invariants .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "a key feature of topological insulators is fermionic _ time - reversal symmetry_. it was shown that two - dimensional time - reversal symmetric insulators admit two topologically distinct phases : the phases can not be deformed into one another as long as the bulk gap and the symmetry are there . in one phase",
    "the insulator is an ordinary one ; that is , it does not carry currents in the bulk nor at the edges . in the other phase edge states",
    "are present .",
    "they come in pairs with opposite velocity and spin .",
    "this phase is called the _ quantum spin hall _ ( qsh )",
    "_ phase _ and its signature is a nonzero spin current , which in contrast to the qh current is not quantized , as a rule . for integer quantum hall systems the topological invariant is a chern number , and",
    "can be read off from the value of the hall conductivity ; for quantum spin hall systems the topological invariant is not expressing the value of the spin current , but the parity of the number of edge states .    in this paper",
    "we prove the _ bulk - edge correspondence _ for two - dimensional topological insulators and for independent particles . for short",
    "we introduce a @xmath0 bulk topological invariant ( to be shown equivalent to others ) , and we show that it is equal to the number of pairs of edge states modulo @xmath1 . for sure , that duality has been discussed in the literature , see _ e.g. _ @xcite , but we maintain that there is room for a strict mathematical approach ; just as for quantum hall systems , where laughlin s argument has gained in precision and detail by the subsequent mathematical discussion .",
    "we should though mention @xcite , whose results are further compared to ours below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec1.1 ]",
    "we consider a general class of two - dimensional single - particle lattice hamiltonians , with and without edge .",
    "they are symmetric under fermionic time reversal and hence potentially describe topological insulators .",
    "one noteworthy feature is that periodicity is postulated only in the direction parallel to the edge . in section  [ mr ]",
    "we formulate the duality in its most basic version , in a precise though still preliminary form .",
    "the purpose of section  [ secexa ] is to show how graphene and related model materials , which have been considered as candidates for topological insulators , fit into our scheme . as a side remark",
    ", we give a simple new proof of the absence of edge states for armchair boundary conditions . in section  [ trib ]",
    "we discuss some abstract vector bundles on the 2-torus . by considering their sections and transition matrices ,",
    "we classify them in terms of a @xmath0-invariant , defined similarly but not identically to one found in @xcite .",
    "so equipped , we define the bulk index in section  [ sec2.1 ] and state in full the basic version of duality ( theorem  [ thm1 ] ) .",
    "it is immediately followed by the main steps of the proof , while technical details are postponed to main part of section  [ secproofs ] .",
    "the part of the article so far described provides a full and self - contained account of basic bulk - edge duality .",
    "it is the most general part , and yet makes up for less than half of its length .    in section  [ secbloch ] we formulate a bulk index for the specific and more familiar case where the lattice hamiltonian is doubly periodic .",
    "as it is to be expected , the relevant 2-torus is now the brillouin zone . we discuss how that index arises from the general one , leaving details to section  [ blbu ] .",
    "all the results obtained up to that point have a counterpart in the case of qh systems , which we present in section  [ qhi ] for illustration , because they are simpler in that context . as a matter of fact ,",
    "for such systems we include an independent , alternate version of the duality based on scattering theory and more precisely on levinson s theorem ( section  [ scatt ] ) , as well as a comparison between the two versions ( section  [ comp ] ) .",
    "related details are found in section  [ bec ] .",
    "we conjecture an analogous alternate version for qsh systems .",
    "finally , section  [ sr ] contains some results about indices , including a comparison of ours with some of those found in the literature .",
    "let us comment on the relation to other work . in @xcite",
    "an edge and a bulk characterization of a topological insulator is given , but without proof of a mathematical link .",
    "in @xcite a correspondence between bulk and edge description is given .",
    "there however the bulk is put in correspondence with twisted boundary conditions allowing tunneling between a pair of edges ; they include open boundaries as a special case",
    ". moreover , the bulk invariant used there is physically different from a @xmath0-classification and may not reflect itself in open boundaries .",
    "in @xcite the bulk - edge duality for topological insulators is derived in the same sense as ours , among other results .",
    "the setting , however , is not quite as general as ours , as far as the side of the bulk is concerned .",
    "as the edge is concerned , an index related to the maslov index is defined and shown to be equivalent to that of @xcite . as for the bulk",
    ", it is assumed that the hamiltonian is the perturbation of one commuting with spin , and hence consisting to several copies of a quantum hall system .",
    "it is assumed that the gap remains open as the perturbation is switched on .",
    "thus spin resolved chern numbers can be defined by homotopy @xcite and the duality inferred from that of the quantum hall case @xcite .",
    "further , assorted comments are : some of our examples are discussed in @xcite in a similar vein .",
    "related indices for topological insulators are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a bulk - edge duality result for general symmetry classes is found in @xcite , differing from the results presented here in various ways ; for instance the index takes values in @xmath2 , with just hints at the @xmath0 case , at least in two dimensions . a choice of a torus and bundle similar to ours in sect .",
    "[ mr ] is found in @xcite .",
    "the results of section  [ secbloch ] depend on the analytic properties of band functions @xcite . in @xcite",
    "bulk - edge duality for hall systems is pinpointed at the birth of edge states of band edges .",
    "this insight is the reason for using levinson s theorem , though the method is otherwise different and the result more general .",
    "last but not least , the existence of a complementary approach to gapped systems , including interacting ones , should be mentioned .",
    "it is based on effective , topological field theories as a tool to explore the response of a system in the limit of low frequencies and long wavelengths ; see @xcite for early examples .",
    "we shall introduce a class of _ bulk _ , resp . _ edge",
    "_ , single - particle discrete schrdinger operators , by which we describe insulators , topological or otherwise , which extend over a plane , resp . a half - plane",
    "we conclude the section with a loose description of the results .",
    "consider , at first and in less than final generality , a tight binding hamiltonian with nearest neighbor hopping on the lattice @xmath3 , resp . @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian is assumed to be periodic in the direction along the edge , but not necessarily across it .",
    "the period may be taken to be equal to one without loss : in fact sites within a period may be regarded as labels of internal degrees of freedom , among others like _",
    "e.g. _ spin .",
    "we may thus perform a bloch decomposition with respect to the longitudinal quasi - momentum @xmath5 , which remains a good quantum number even in presence of the boundary .",
    "we so end up with a family of hamiltonians @xmath6 defined on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath7 , resp .",

    "that amounts to the dirichlet condition after adding @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "contrary to what the above motivation might suggest , the hamiltonians ( [ 1.1 ] , [ 1.2 ] ) are prompted by more than just the square lattice . in the next section",
