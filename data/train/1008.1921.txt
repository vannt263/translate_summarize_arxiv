    "transverse parton momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) and generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) describe complementary aspects of the transverse nucleon structure .",
    "tmds @xcite describe the _ momentum distribution _ of partons in the transverse plane .",
    "gpds @xcite describe their _ spatial distribution _ in the transverse plane @xcite ( and much more @xcite ) .",
    "it is known how to learn from gpds about orbital angular momentum of partons in the nucleon , namely @xcite ( using impact parameter presentation @xcite ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the helicity distribution and @xmath2 the impact parameter .",
    "this decomposition has the advantage that all spin contributions are measurable quantities .",
    "other decomposition schemes exist @xcite and give , in gauge theories , in general different results @xcite .        in this way",
    ", one obtains from the spatial distribution of partons in the transverse plane information about orbital angular momentum .",
    "tmds contain information on the parton momenta @xmath3 in the transverse plane .",
    "this is in some sense complimentary to gpds , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1:naive - picture ] . intuitively , one would therefore expect tmds to contain also information about orbital angular momentum",
    ". however , so far no rigorous connection of orbital angular momentum and tmds could be established .",
    "recent results from quark models could indicate a possible connection , and the key to that is `` pretzelosity . ''",
    "we review the recent developments .",
    "the light - front correlator ( with @xcite a process - dependent gauge - link @xmath4 ) @xmath5 allows us to define the twist-2 chiral - odd tmds of the nucleon as @xmath6       = s_t^j\\,h_1   + s_l\\,\\frac{p_t^j}{m_n}\\,h_{1l}^\\perp       + \\frac{\\varepsilon^{jk}p_t^k}{m_n}\\,h_1^\\perp\\ ; & & \\nonumber\\\\      + \\;\\ ;      \\frac{(p_t^j p_t^k-\\frac12\\,\\vec{p}_t^{\\:2}\\delta^{jk})s_t^k}{m_n^2}\\ ,      h_{1t}^\\perp \\ , . & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all tmds in ( [ eq : chiral - odd - tmds ] ) depend on @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and can be accessed in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xcite in combination with the collins fragmentation function @xcite @xmath9 by measuring various azimuthal ( single spin ) asymmetries . in particular @xmath10    positivity bounds",
    "@xcite constrain @xmath11 with the ( 1)-moment defined as @xmath12 .    in the limit of a large number @xmath13 of colors in qcd @xcite pretzelosity behaves as @xmath14 .",
    "interesting aspects are @xcite that it describes the `` non - sphericity '' of the spin distribution of quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon , and requires @xcite the presence of nucleon wave - function components differing by two units of orbital angular momentum . at large @xmath7",
    "it is predicted @xcite to behave as @xmath15 .",
    "that is all that is known about this function model - independently .",
    "what raised much interest about this tmd are results from quark models .",
    "the following relation was found in the bag model in ref .",
    "[ ] @xmath16 this relation is supported also in other @xcite though not all @xcite quark models , and is broken when gauge field degrees of freedom are present @xcite , see [ ] for a review .",
    "notice that @xmath12 , and if we recall that the difference of @xmath17 and @xmath18 vanishes in the non - relativistic limit @xcite , we see that this ( 1)-moment of pretzelosity is a measure of relativistic effects in the nucleon .",
    "this is not surprizing because in this limit @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and similarly for other tmds , i.e. in the non - relativistic limit the ( 1)-moments of all tmds vanish .",
    "another interesting model relation is the remarkable _ non - linear relation _ first observed in the covariant parton model @xcite connecting all t - even , chiral - odd , twist-2 tmds : @xmath22 ^ 2         \\;\\,\\stackrel{\\rm model}{=}\\;\\ ,         - \\,h_1^q(x , p_t^{})\\,h_{1t}^{\\perp q}(x , p_t^{})\\;.\\ ] ] this relation implies an attractive prediction .",
    "the transversity distribution gives rise to the single spin asymmetry @xmath23 whose sign is known experimentally @xcite . from ( [ eq : rel - non - linear ] ) it immediately follows that the pretzelosity asymmetry in ( [ eq : autpretzel ] ) must have opposite sign @xcite , i.e.@xmath24       = ( -\\,1 ) \\cdot { \\rm sign}\\,[\\,a_{ut}^{\\sin ( \\phi+\\phi_s)}\\,]\\;,\\ ] ] which is expected @xcite to hold in the valence-@xmath7 region , where this prediction is confirmed by compass for negative hadrons from a deuteron target.@xcite .",
    "many more quark model relations among tmds were found , see [ ] for the derivation of a complete set of relations in the bag model , and it is understood why they are widely supported in a large class of quark models @xcite .    the pretzelosity - relation ( [ eq : pretzel - relation ] ) plays a particularly important role in what follows for the following reason .",
    "namely , it was shown in the light - cone su(6 ) quark - diquark model @xcite that the contribution to the nucleon spin from the orbital angular momentum of quarks is related to the difference of transversity and helicity distributions , i.e.  to the right - hand - side of the pretzelosity - relation ( [ eq : pretzel - relation ] ) found in @xcite . it was subsequently shown that the pretzelosity - relation ( [ eq : pretzel - relation ] ) is valid also in the light - cone su(6 ) quark - diquark model @xcite .",
    "in other words , the ( 1)-moment of pretzelosity is , in this quark model , a measure for the contribution of quark orbital angular momentum to the nucleon spin .",
    "this exciting finding was subsequently confirmed in the bag model @xcite and the covariant parton model @xcite .",
    "more precisely , three different quark models @xcite support the relation @xmath25 ( in principle , there is a fourth model where it holds : in the non - relativistic limit one has the consistent result @xcite @xmath26 ) .    an interesting question in this context : how can chiral - odd ( pretzelosity ) and chiral - even ( orbital angular momentum ) quantities",
    "be related ?",
    "the answer in the bag model is as follows .",
    "here the quark wave - function has an upper-(@xmath27-wave-)component and a lower-(@xmath28-wave-)component .",
    "the expectation value of the orbital angular momentum operator in the @xmath27-wave is zero , i.e.  only the @xmath28-wave contributes .",
    "next , we know @xcite pretzelosity requires @xmath29 which in the bag model is possible only through interference of the @xmath30 components of the @xmath28-wave , i.e.  again only the @xmath28-wave contributes . finally , knowing that only the @xmath28-wave ( i.e.  the lower component of the dirac - spinor ) matters , we can `` replace '' in the operator of pretzelosity @xmath31 = @xmath32 ( in bjorken - drell notation ) by @xmath33(unit matrix ) .",
    "this changes the number of gamma - matrices by one unit , and `` transforms '' a chiral - odd operator into a chiral - even one @xcite .    from this exercise",
    "we learn : the relation between pretzelosity and orbital angular momentum is at best at the level of matrix elements .",
    "in other words , there is no operator - identity between these quantities  not even in quark models .",
    "it is interesting to stress that in quark models the result for @xmath34 does not depend on which orbital angular momentum definition @xcite is used @xcite .",
    "having discussed that in quark models pretzelosity is related to orbital angular momentum , it is interesting to ask what quark models actually predict .",
    "[ fig-2:tmds - model]a shows the bag model predictions for @xmath35 in comparison to @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the negative sign and the large magnitude of @xmath35",
    "can be understood from the non - relativistic limit @xcite , where pretzelosity is enhanced by the factor @xmath38 compared to @xmath36 or @xmath37 , see sec .",
    "[ sec-2:review - pretzelosity ] .",
    "relativistic models ( like the bag model ) preserve this enhancement . concerning the @xmath39-dependence of pretzelosity ( and other tmds ) , we remark that in the bag @xcite and covariant parton @xcite model it is approximately gaussian which is supported by phenomenology @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath40 is not constrained by positivity , but @xmath41 is , see sec .",
    "[ sec-2:review - pretzelosity ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 enters cross sections with a prefactor of @xmath43 from the correlator ( [ eq : correlator ] ) .",
    "so in observables effectively the ( 1)-moment of pretzelosity is relevant , and the latter is not large in the bag @xcite or light - cone constituent @xcite model .",
    "in fact , the latter predicts @xcite a small asymmetry ( [ eq : autpretzel ] ) .",
    "the covariant parton model @xcite predicts large @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ fig-2:tmds - model]b , and hence a sizable pretzelosity asymmetry ( [ eq : autpretzel ] ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2:tmds - model]c for the kinematics of the clas experiment with 12 gev upgrade @xcite .",
    "the predictions are consistent with preliminary sidis data @xcite showing a zero within error bars effect .",
    "recent compass data @xcite show a small but non - vanishing effect and confirm the signs predicted for @xmath42 , as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec-2:review - pretzelosity ] .",
    "one has to bear in mind that so far the exciting relation ( [ eq : oam - pretzel ] ) between tmds and orbital angular momentum is established only in quark models .",
    "an important question is : to what extent can we trust such models ?",
    "one way to address this question consists in reproducing ( si)dis spin observables within a given quark model . on the basis of the comparison of model results and data it was found @xcite that ( light - cone constituent ) quark models work in the valence @xmath7-region @xmath45 with an accuracy of ( 1030)@xmath46 .    in this context",
    "we recall that the absence of gauge degrees of freedom implies in quark models certain relations among tmds ( called `` lirs '' ) , which hold approximately in qcd upon the neglect of quark - gluon - quark correlators and current quark mass terms @xcite . for the collinear twist-3 parton distribution function @xmath47 such an approximation works reasonably well @xcite but it needs to be tested for other tmds @xcite .",
    "if lirs were confirmed to be reasonably good approximations , this would be a necessary ( not sufficient ) condition for quark model predictions of the type ( [ eq : pretzel - relation ] ,  [ eq : oam - pretzel ] ) to work similarly .",
    "the concept of quark orbital angular momentum is difficult to address rigorously in gauge field theories .",
    "gpds and tmds , which describe complementary aspects of the nucleon structure , give rise to a dual ( in quark models equivalent ) picture of quark orbital angular momentum as follows @xmath48 where gpds @xmath49 and tmds = @xmath50 .",
    "the first relation ( [ eq : oam - gpd ] ) holds exactly in qcd and in consistent models @xcite . the second relation ( [ eq : oam - tmd ] ) holds in a large class of relativistic quark models @xcite .",
    "quark models catch important features of qcd , and could provide useful insights also in the context of gpds , tmds and orbital angular momentum , provided one uses them responsibly within their range of applicability .",
    "recent advances @xcite allow us to test these relations in lattice qcd , where due the presently often practioned omission of disconnected diagrams valence quarks are probed .",
    "in the discussion following the talk it was pointed out that in [ ] the predictions from quark models were shown to be compatible with phenomenology and lattice data , resolving the `` spin crisis '' from quark model point of view .",
