    "early  type galaxies ( etgs ) are known to populate a two - dimensional manifold in the space of their observed quantities .",
    "this fundamental plane ( fp ) is usually expressed by a correlation among the effective radius , the mean surface brightness within , and the central velocity dispersion 0 : @xmath10 due to the small intrinsic dispersion ( @xmath11 in and 0 , and @xmath12 in ) , the fp is considered as a powerful tool to measure galaxy distances and to constrain the processes driving galaxy evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .    a relevant projection of the fp is the correlation between and , also known as kormendy relation ( hereafter kr ) : @xmath13 where is the effective radius in @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "different studies have demonstrated that in the nearby universe bright etgs define a sharp sequence in the  plane , with an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 in ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite have shown that @xmath18 form two distinct families in the plane of the effective parameters : that of the bright etgs , following the kr , and another ` ordinary ' family , whose properties are more disperse and heterogeneous",
    ". recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) demonstrated that the claimed dichotomy between the bright and the dwarf etgs is only apparent and that there is a continuous structural relation between the two classes .",
    "in particular , the different behavior of bright and dwarf etgs in the  plane , and the change in slope of their relations , do not imply a different formation mechanism but can be interpreted with systematic changes in the profile shape with galaxy magnitude .    in order to understand the processes underlying galaxy formation and evolution , it is crucial to investigate the fp and the other relations between galaxy parameters at different look - back times . in the monolithic formation scenario @xcite , etgs form at very high redshifts in a strong burst of star formation , and the distribution of galaxies in the space of observed quantities changes with redshift due to the passive fading of their stars . in the hierarchical framework ,",
    "bright etgs form by the progressive merging of smaller units , and the fp relations are built up with redshift .",
    "different works have shown ( 1 ) that ( dissipation - less ) merging seems to move galaxies along the fp @xcite , and ( 2 ) that in hierarchical models , the luminosity  weighted ages of stellar populations in cluster galaxies appear to be the same of those predicted for pure passive evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these facts suggest that for both scenarios dynamical effects could play a minor role in the evolution of scaling correlations .",
    "it is expected that the fp slopes change with redshift mainly for possible differences in properties of galaxy stellar populations ( such as age and metallicity ) along the early - type sequence , while the zero point varies consistently with the evolution of a passive stellar population . in the hierarchical framework , however , it is also expected that the distribution in the space of observed quantities evolves with redshift , as merging proceeds to larger and larger sizes .",
    "clearly , in order to analyze this subject , large samples of galaxies are needed at different look - back times .    in the recent years , it has become feasible to study the scaling relations at intermediate redshifts . due to the heavy demand of observing time in velocity dispersion measurements ,",
    "many studies have investigated pure photometric laws , like the kr .",
    "the main effort to constrain the evolution of the kr slope with redshift has been performed by @xcite , who analyzed etgs properties in four clusters at @xmath19 and in one at @xmath20 , with an average of @xmath21@xmath22 galaxies per cluster .",
    "these authors found that the slope is comprised between 2.2 and 3.5 both for the coma and for the distant clusters , depending on the selection criteria of the samples , and suggested , therefore , that it could not have evolved since @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of the kr zero point for cluster galaxies has been investigated in different works in order to perform the tolman surface brightness test for the universal expansion @xcite and to derive the luminosity evolution of etgs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these studies concluded that the measured change is consistent with what expected on the basis of cosmological dimming plus passive aging of stellar populations formed at high redshifts .",
    "the kr was investigated at high redshifts for galaxies in the hubble deep field by @xcite , who found that etgs in the field seem to follow the same restframe kr also at redshifts @xmath24 .    as shown by @xcite , it is possible to derive structural parameters of galaxies at intermediate redshifts by using ground  based imaging . in the present work ,",
    "we use structural parameters in the v - band restframe for a total of @xmath25 spheroids in the clusters 209 at @xmath26 , 118 at @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( hereafter 0048 ) at @xmath0 , and investigate the evolution of the distribution in the  plane up to a look - back time of @xmath29 .",
    "surface photometry for galaxies in 209 , 118 and 0048 is published in @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges of previous works on the subject has been represented by selection effects , which can critically affect the determination of the kr . to work out this problem",
    ", we introduce a new fitting procedure , which provides un - biased estimates of the kr coefficients , and allows for the first time to investigate the evolution over redshift of the whole distribution in the plane of effective parameters .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section  [ sdata ] , we present the samples used for the analysis .",

    "the data relevant for the present study include images in the r band for 209 and 118 , and in the i band for 0048 , all corresponding approximately to v - band restframe . for 118 and 0048 , galaxies were selected according to the photometric redshift technique ( see  @xcite , and references therein ) , while for 209 we considered the sample of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members from @xcite complemented with photometric data ( see below ) .",
    "the relevant information on the samples are summarized in table  [ data ] .",
    "structural parameters were derived as described in @xcite , by fitting galaxy images with sersic models convolved with suitable representations of the psf .",

    "a magnitude complete sample was obtained by adding to the spectroscopic data all the spheroids within the colour  magnitude sequence of 209 ( see  @xcite ) down to @xmath50 .",
    "we point out that the present samples constitute the largest data set ( @xmath51 ) of cluster galaxies , for which the kormendy relation is investigated up to a look - back time of @xmath52 .    in order to compare the distributions in the  plane at intermediate redshifts with that of nearby galaxies",

    "since it was not possible to select galaxies in the jfk95a sample by using sersic indices as for the other clusters , we adopted the relation between sersic index and central velocity dispersion recently found for nearby galaxies by @xcite : @xmath57 .",
    "we considered the sample of coma etgs with available velocity dispersion from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter jfk95b , @xmath58 ) and from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter j99 , @xmath59 ) . among these galaxies ,",
    "@xmath60 objects have surface photometry from jfk95a . according to @xcite ( figure  1 ) , we selected galaxies with @xmath61 , which corresponds to @xmath62 , resulting in a sample of @xmath63 objects .",
    "we also excluded from the calculation of the fitting coefficients the three galaxies with largest size in the jfk95a sample : due to the presence of extended halos the use of a de vaucouleurs model can give very different parameters with respect to the estimates obtained by the sersic models .",
    "the final sample consists in @xmath64 galaxies brighter than @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the thuan ",
    "gunn r - band magnitude   band and the v - band restframe at the redshift is not relevant for the present study ] .",
    "we note that , due to the previous selections , the coma sample does not constitute a magnitude complete sample of galaxies .",
    "this point will be further addressed in section  [ fitkr ] .    for 209 , 118 , and 0048 , mean surface brightnesses were corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite , while the cosmological dimming was not removed . for the sample ,",
    "since both corrections were applied by jfk95a , we added the term @xmath67 to the values .",
    "the  diagrams for , 209 , 118 , and 0048 are shown in figure  [ krel ] . for each cluster , spheroids follow a sharp , well defined kr .",
    "since selection effects can strongly affect the estimate of the kr coefficients ( see  @xcite ) , we fitted the  sequences by introducing a modified least square procedure ( hereafter @xmath68 , see appendix  [ appa ] ) , which corrects the bias due to the different completeness cuts in magnitude and of each sample .",
    "the fitting coefficients were derived by minimizing the rms of the residuals with respect to and ( and fits ) , and by applying the bisector regression ( , see  @xcite ) , which is more stable and effective with respect to the other fitting methods .    in order to illustrate the reliability of the adopted procedure",
    ", we applied different magnitude cuts , @xmath69 , to the sample of 118 , which has the largest number of galaxies , and for each value of @xmath69 we derived the slope and the zero point of the kr by using the @xmath68 and the ordinary least square ( @xmath70 ) fits . in figure  [ bias_fitkr ]",
    "we show the variations of @xmath4 and @xmath71 as a function of @xmath69 for the bisector fit .",
    "similar results are obtained for the and the regressions .",
    "the completeness cut affects significantly the ols method , producing the well known malmquist bias : for lower values of @xmath69 the slope of the kr is overestimated while the value of @xmath71 decreases systematically . on the contrary ,",
    "it is evident that the @xmath68 procedure removes efficiently the systematic trends of the @xmath70 method , providing un - biased estimates of the kr coefficients .",
    "this implies that the @xmath68 fit allows a straightforward comparison of the slope and of the zeropoint of the kr , ruling out any effect related to the different selection criteria of the samples .",
    "since the selection criteria for the coma cluster are different with respect to those of the other clusters , we also verified that the fitting results for this sample are not affected by the cuts in magnitude and velocity dispersion . according to the scatter of the relation between velocity dispersion and sersic index by @xcite dispersion of @xmath72 , we varied the velocity dispersion cut within @xmath73 and re - derived the @xmath68 coefficients .",
    "it turned out that the slope @xmath4 of the kr changes by few percents , while the corresponding variations of the zeropoint are within @xmath74 .",
    "these values are fully consistent with the estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath71 that are given in sections  [ sbev ] and  [ slev ] .",
    "a similar result was obtained by changing the magnitude limit of the sample down to @xmath75 .",
    "it is worth to be noted that the values we obtained for the coefficients of the kr at @xmath76 are in very good agreement ( see sections  [ sbev ] and  [ slev ] ) with those of previous works for bright nearby etgs , spanning a much wider luminosity range ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the selection effects on the local reference sample do not affect , therefore , the present analysis .",
    "another important point is the correlation between the uncertainties on galaxy parameters : for the effective parameters , we have @xmath77 ( see  jfk95a ) , where the value of @xmath78 depends on the methods used to derive and , and the corresponding uncertainties . in order to estimate the range of possible values of @xmath78 , we compared the uncertainties on and for samples of galaxies from different sources ( @xcite ) : we found @xmath79 . by using numerical simulations ( see  @xcite ) and by comparing repeated measurements of and ( see  @xcite ) , we obtained @xmath80 for the parameters of 209 , 118 , and 0048 , in agreement with the quoted range of @xmath78 values .",
    "the correlation between and and the typical values of the uncertainties on the effective parameters are shown in figure  [ krel ] . the effect on the kr coefficients",
    "was estimated by using numerical simulations of the  diagrams , by a procedure analogous to that described in @xcite .",
    "we found that the bias on the kr coefficients is negligible , amounting at most to @xmath81 for 118 .",
    "this is in agreement with what found by @xcite for the  relation of nearby bright ellipticals and spiral bulges .",
    "the slopes of the krs are reported in table  [ krslope ] , while the variation of @xmath4 with redshift is shown in figure  [ bev ] .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated by the bootstrap method and amount to @xmath82@xmath83 for 209 , 118 , and 0048 .",
    "we note that the uncertainty for the sample is significantly higher ( @xmath84  @xmath85 ) due to the smaller range of .",
    "figure  [ bev ] clearly shows that the values of @xmath4 are fully consistent for each pair of clusters , except for the and slopes of the sample , which are consistent with the other values at a lower significance level ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the and methods are more sensitive , with respect to the method , to the range of used in the fit , that is fully consistent with the value in table  [ bev ] . ] .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that no significant evolution in the slope of the kr is found up to @xmath87 .",
    "we also note that the weighted means of @xmath4 reported in table  [ krmslope ] for the various fitting procedures are in very good agreement with values found by previous studies at @xmath88 : e.g. @xmath89 ( @xcite ) , @xmath90 ( @xcite ) and @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of the kr slope with redshift , @xmath92 , carries information on the variation in the properties of the mean stellar populations ( sps ) as a function of galaxy radius : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the luminosity evolution between @xmath0 and @xmath95 at a given . in appendix",

    "the uncertainties on @xmath71 and @xmath118 were obtained by numerical simulations , taking also into account the measurement error on the adopted value of the slope .",
    "we estimated the intrinsic dispersion of the relations ( ) by subtracting in quadrature to @xmath119 the amount of dispersion on @xmath116 due to the measurement errors on and . to this aim",

    "the values are given in table  [ krpar ] .",
    "it is clear from the table that the kr has significant intrinsic dispersion also at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath120 in ) , and that this dispersion does not change with redshift .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the kr is consistent with that reported by @xcite and @xcite for nearby galaxies , and is mainly due to neglecting velocity dispersions in the fp relation ( eq .",

    "since the @xmath68 fit provides un - biased estimates of the kr coefficients , this procedure is not affected by the different selection criteria of each sample .",
    "the cluster was not considered in order to analyze only the samples with structural parameters derived by the same procedure ( see below ) . the combined  diagram for 209 , 118 , and 0048",

    ", we used the two - dimensional ks test ( @xcite ) .",
    "the test was repeated by using different shifts for each cluster to take into account the uncertainties on @xmath71 reported in table  [ krpar ] . comparing 118 with the other two clusters , we found probabilities of the ks statistics between @xmath132 and @xmath133 , while a larger probability ( @xmath134 ) was obtained by comparing 209 and 0048 .",
    "we point out that the last result is of particular interest , since the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of 209 and 0048 are similar and are comparable with the intrinsic dispersion of the kr .",
    "since the error bars for the 118 data are significantly larger , we also performed the ks test by adding further scatter to the  diagram of 209 and 0048 in order to mimic the measurement uncertainties on the effective parameters at @xmath135 . in this case",

    "the fact that the ks probabilities and the value of @xmath141 are lower with respect to those obtained for the other distributions can be explained by the different procedure by which the structural parameters of the cluster are derived , and is therefore not relevant for the present analysis .",

    "<S> we study the evolution of the relation between half - light ( effective ) radius , , and mean surface brightness , , known as kormendy relation , out to redshift @xmath0 in v - band restframe on the basis of a large sample of spheroidal galaxies ( @xmath1 ) belonging to three clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the present sample constitutes the largest data set for which the kormendy relation is investigated up to a look - back time of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . a new fitting procedure , which suitably accounts for selection criteria effects , allows for the first time to study the trend of the slope ( @xmath4 ) and of the intrinsic dispersion ( ) of the kormendy relation , and the properties of the whole distribution in the  plane as a function of look - back time . the slope @xmath4 of the relation does not change from @xmath0 to the present epoch : @xmath5 , implying a tight constraint of @xmath6@xmath7 on the variation of the stellar formation epoch along the sequence of spheroidal galaxies per decade of radius . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic dispersion of the relation , @xmath8 , does not vary with redshift and the distribution of galaxy sizes as well as the distribution in the plane of the effective parameters do not vary among the clusters , as proven by the kolmogorov  smirnov tests . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , whatever the mechanism driving galaxy evolution is , it does not affect significantly the properties of bright galaxies in the  plane at least since @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the zeropoint of the kormendy relation is fully explained by the cosmological dimming in an expanding universe plus the passive luminosity evolution of stellar populations with high formation redshift ( @xmath9 ) . </S>"
