    "low angular resolution studies of early - type galaxies found that the x - ray emission from these systems typically consists of two components , a soft , thermal component from hot gas , and a harder , power - law component attributed to unresolved x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the superb angular resolution of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has allowed for a significant fraction of the power - law component to be resolved into point sources , confirming the binary nature of the hard component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite , using _",
    "data , found that the x - ray to optical luminosity ratio , @xmath2 , was proportional to the gc - specific frequency , @xmath3 ( the number of gcs per unit optical luminosity ) , of the galaxies .",
    "they found no correlation between the stellar age of the galaxies and @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite concluded that most or all of the lmxbs in early - type galaxies were formed in gcs and further suggested that the lmxbs not associated with gcs either had been ejected from gcs or were formed in gcs that had since disrupted .",
    "the similarities in the properties of the gc lmxbs and those found in the fields of early - type galaxies has been used as support for this scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it has been noted that the fraction of lmxbs found in gcs shows some dependence on @xmath3 @xcite . in this letter , we show that the relationship between the fraction of lmxbs found in gcs and @xmath3 is consistent with the field population of lmxbs being formed via primordial binary formation in the fields of the galaxies .",
    "we assume that lmxb formation in early - type galaxies is the same as commonly accepted for the milky way . in this scenario ,",
    "the field lmxbs are formed _ in situ _ via primordial binary formation and the lmxbs associated with gcs are formed through dynamical interactions in the clusters . for any galaxy ,",
    "the fraction of lmxbs found in gcs , denoted by @xmath5 , is equal to @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the numbers of lmxbs found in gcs and the field , respectively .",
    "it has long been recognized that gcs produce @xmath9 times more lmxbs per unit mass than the field of the galaxy .",
    "this enhanced formation efficiency is attributed to dynamical interactions between nss and stars in the dense environments of gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observational evidence suggests that @xmath10% of gcs have a bright ( @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 ) lmxb regardless of the host galaxy morphological type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . given the similarities in the average properties of gcs in all galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this constant lmxb formation efficiency is not surprising and is a measure of the efficiency of dynamical formation mechanisms .",
    "we then expect that @xmath7 is proportional to the number of gcs in the galaxy .",
    "the number of gcs is equal to @xmath3 times the galaxy luminosity in the appropriate units . for our purposes , it is more interesting to give @xmath7 in terms of the galaxy mass , so we assume a fixed mass - to - light ratio for our sample galaxies . therefore , we find that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the stellar mass of the galaxy . here , and throughout , we neglect differences in the stellar mass - to - light ratio of our sample galaxies as we are primarily concerned with early - type systems . were we to compare early- and late - type galaxies , it would be more appropriate to use the mass normalized gc - specific frequency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "lmxbs in the field of the galaxy are the descendants of primordial binaries containing a massive star .",
    "lmxbs have a long ( @xmath15  gyr ) lag time between star formation and the x - ray active phase @xcite and therefore track the star formation history over long timescales . for a single starburst model for star formation in early - type galaxies , the number of lmxbs formed from primordial binaries will be a function of the stellar mass involved in the star formation event and the time since star formation occurred .",
    "initially , the number of active lmxbs will increase until @xmath15  gyr and then begin to decrease with time @xcite .",
    "the exact time dependence of the lmxb population is unknown .",
    "in addition , complex star - formation histories , such as small starbursts associated with mergers , will complicate the time dependence for any galaxy .",
    "for our model , we assume that the time dependent variation of the field lmxb population is small when comparing different early - type galaxies . under this assumption , @xmath8 is simply proportional to @xmath14 .    plugging the relationships for @xmath7 and @xmath8 into equation  [ eqn:1 ] and rearranging , we find @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant that accounts for the formation efficiencies in gcs and the field , and the mass - to - light ratio of the galaxies . to test this model , we have accumulated data from the literature for nine early - type galaxies with both _",

    "table  [ tab:1 ] gives the values of @xmath3 and the calculated fraction of lmxbs found in gcs .",

    "the data and best - fit function are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] . for reference",
    ", we have included a data point for the milky way with @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the milky way data point includes both the disk and bulge contributions . as we see",
    ", the data follow the expected trend from our model .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the field population of lmxbs in early - type galaxies was formed in the field from primordial binaries .",
    "while it is intriguing that the best - fit model also fits the milky way data point , it should be noted that for a luminosity limit similar to those found in studies of early - type galaxies , the fraction of lmxbs in gcs in the milky way is highly uncertain because of low number statistics , difficulties in determining the distance to galactic lmxbs , and the issue of including transient systems in the statistics . as noted earlier , mass - to - light ratio differences may also be important when comparing the gc - specific frequency across morphological types .",
    "we can also compare the prediction of this model to other observed properties of the lmxbs in early - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath2 for the hard spectral component in early - type galaxies was proportional to @xmath26 . assuming that the total x - ray luminosity of the lmxbs can be approximated by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an average x - ray luminosity per binary , assuming the same average luminosity for gc and field systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath29 is the total number of lmxbs in the galaxy , our model would predict that @xmath30 varies linearly with @xmath3 . while not the same relationship found by @xcite , we find that the data are equally well fitted by our model .",
    "it has also been shown that @xmath29 and @xmath31 in early - type galaxies are proportional to the stellar mass of the galaxies with a weak dependence on the morphological type @xcite .",
    "our model would also predict that @xmath29 and @xmath32 are proportional to the stellar mass of the galaxies with some dependence on the gc - specific frequency that could yield the morphological type difference seen .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite suggest that statistics and inaccurate calibration of the near - infrared mass - to - light ratio may cause some of the morphological dependence seen in their data .",
    "our model would predict that the dependence on @xmath3 would be of the order of a factor of 1.5 given the galaxies in the @xcite sample , similar to what was measured .",
    "however , the inclusion of late - type galaxies may actually decrease the significance of this effect given the expected difference in the field lmxb population formation .",
    "a further study encompassing early - type galaxies with a larger range of @xmath3 values is warranted .",
    "the high ( @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 ) observed luminosities of the lmxbs in early - type galaxies has been used to suggest that such systems could not have formed from primordial binaries since the x - ray lifetimes of such systems would be much shorter than the stellar age of the galaxy .",
    "the general argument is that at @xmath33  erg  s@xmath12 and with a @xmath34 companion , the system would have an x - ray active phase of less than @xmath35  myr .",
    "there are many difficulties with this conclusion .",
    "first , the lag time between binary formation and lmxb activity can be quite long .",
    "if the companion is a @xmath34 donor that starts mass transfer after the donor has turned off the main sequence , then the binary was formed more than 10  gyr ago . for systems that start mass transfer on the main sequence , the time between the formation of the binary and the start of mass transfer is dictated by either gravitational radiation or magnetic braking , both of which have characteristic timescales of the order of a few gigayears ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also important to recognize that the mass - transfer rates observationally inferred may not accurately reflect the long - term mass - transfer rates due to short - timescale fluctuations , such as the disk ionization instability or x - ray irradiation of the companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result of such effects , intrinsically low ( @xmath36  yr@xmath12 ) mass - transfer rate systems can masquerade as high mass - transfer rate systems .",
    "all of the bh lmxbs in the milky way , as well as a comparable number of ns systems , exhibit x - ray outburst phases in which the maximum luminosity is a significant fraction of the eddington limit for the compact object .",
    "these systems , commonly referred to as soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , are thought to have low mass - transfer rates from the donor such that the accretion disk is unstable to the disk ionization instability @xcite . in sxts ,",
    "the systems undergo outbursts lasting days to months ( and even years in some cases ) and then return to a quiescent state . the recurrence time can be as short as a year or longer than the history of x - ray astronomy . while the disk instability model works well in predicting which systems are likely to undergo this phenomena",
    ", it provides no clues as to the length of the x - ray outbursts or recurrence times .",
    "other transient phenomena , such the effect of x - ray irradiation on the donor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can also cause intrinsically low mass - transfer systems to have observed luminosities much higher than expected .",
    "it has been suggested that gcs may contribute to the field lmxb population through ejection of lmxbs or disruption of the clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these alternatives have been invoked for a number of reasons including the expected short x - ray active lifetimes of lmxbs formed from primordial binaries and the similarities in the x - ray properties of the field and gc populations of lmxbs .",
    "but it is important to recognize that once lmxbs leave the gc environments , through either ejection or disruption , they will evolve like primordial binaries and would have similar x - ray active lifetimes .",
    "therefore , gc formation of field lmxb scenarios require a constant input of lmxbs into the field to account for the observed population",
    ".    the same dynamical processes that form lmxbs in gcs would be responsible for the ejection of these systems .",
    "therefore , the number of lmxbs ejected from gcs in any galaxy would be proportional to the number of gcs or @xmath37 .",
    "if all of the field lmxbs were due to ejections , we would expect no dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath3 .",
    "our data rule out this scenario at greater than the 99.99% confidence level .",
    "while not required , we can not rule out that some small fraction of the field lmxb population was ejected from gcs with the current data .",
    "the upper limit on the fraction of the field population due to ejections is dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath38 , we find that @xmath39% of the field population of lmxbs could have been ejected from gcs .    theoretical studies of gc disruption find that a significant fraction of the gcs in a galaxy will be disrupted with the exact fraction showing some dependence on the galaxy properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if we assume that disruption of a gc does not change the probability for lmxb formation in the cluster , then to fully account for the number of lmxbs seen in the field of early - type galaxies , the number of disrupted clusters must be between 0.5 and 4 times the number of gcs currently observed .",
    "such numbers push the limits of what is expected from current models for gc disruption @xcite , but lmxbs from disruptions can not be ruled out .",
    "one difficulty however , is that a significant fraction of the disruptions may occur early in the history of the galaxy , in the first @xmath40  gyr . at early times ,",
    "the dynamical interactions in gcs may be less efficient at producing lmxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that the observed relationship between the fraction of lmxbs found in gcs and the gc - specific frequency in early - type galaxies is consistent with the field population of lmxbs forming _ in situ _ via primordial binary formation . to test our model ,",
    "better data for both @xmath5 and @xmath3 are required . in current studies ,",
    "only a fraction of the lmxb population in early - type galaxies can be compared to the gc population because of differences in the field of views of the instruments .",
    "more thorough coverage of the _ chandra _ field of view by gc studies will improve the statistics for @xmath5 .",
    "the values for @xmath3 are also subject to observational uncertainties because of uncertainties in the estimates of both the number of gcs and the optical magnitude of the galaxies . of particular note",

    "the gc lmxbs are not expected to be dependent on the stellar age of the galaxy , and therefore the inability to separate gc and field lmxbs , due to the low spatial resolution of _ asca _ , may explain why no age dependence was found in the @xcite study .",

    "better coverage of the lmxb and gc populations is necessary , especially at the inner and outer regions of the galaxies where the gc and optical light profiles are the most different .",
    "two additional effects must also be considered : _ i _ ) how supernova kicks will affect the distribution of primordial binaries in the field , and _ ii _ ) how the preference of gc lmxbs to be located in red , rather than blue , gcs @xcite affects the gc lmxb distribution .",
    "given the different formation mechanisms for field and gc lmxbs , it is reasonable to assume that the distributions of the physical parameters ( i.e. , orbital period , donor mass , and mass transfer rates ) will be different .",

    "such a study is essential in determining if a luminosity function difference is expected and/or measurable . also , a better understanding of how transient behavior affects the observed luminosity function is also necessary .",
    "multi - epoch observations of lmxbs in early - type galaxies will provide more information on the transient behavior of lmxbs , although longer observations are required to distinguish between real transient behavior ( luminosity changes of more than 3 orders of magnitude ) and the factor of @xmath50 variability commonly seen in persistent lmxbs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
