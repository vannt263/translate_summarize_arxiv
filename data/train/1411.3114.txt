    "chiral effective field theory ( eft ) as proposed in the pioneering works of weinberg @xcite is a powerful tool for the derivation of baryonic forces . in this scheme",
    "there is an underlying power counting which allows one to improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in a perturbative expansion . in addition , it is possible to derive two- and corresponding three - body and even four - body forces as well as external current operators in a consistent way . for a review ,",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , a hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interaction has been derived up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in chiral eft by the jlich - bonn - munich group @xcite . at that order",
    "there are contributions from one- and two - pseudoscalar - meson exchange diagrams ( involving @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and from four - baryon contact terms without and with two derivatives .",
    "su(3 ) flavor symmetry is imposed for constructing the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the assumed su(3 ) symmetry allows us to fix all the coupling constants at the various meson - baryon vertices , and it reduces the number of free parameters which arise within the eft approach in form of low - energy constants ( lecs ) associated with the aforementioned contact terms . in the actual calculation the su(3 ) symmetry is broken , however , because the physical masses of the involved mesons and octet baryons ( @xmath9 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath10 ) are used . with this interaction an excellent reproduction of available low - energy @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering data could be achieved as reflected in a total @xmath13 of about @xmath14 for the @xmath15 data points included in the fit @xcite .",
    "thus , the description of the @xmath5 system at nlo is on the same level of quality as by the most advanced meson - exchange @xmath5 interactions .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the properties of our @xmath5 interactions in nuclear matter .",
    "specifically , we report results for the single particle ( s.p . )",
    "potential of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 hyperons in nuclear matter obtained in a conventional @xmath4-matrix calculation based on the standard ( gap ) choice for the intermediate spectrum . of specific interest for us are two long - standing issues that have been discussed extensively in the literature , namely the repulsive nature of the @xmath3-nucleus potential and the weak @xmath2-nucleus spin - orbit interaction . for recent overviews of strangeness nuclear physics",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the @xmath3-nuclear potential is repulsive @xcite .",
    "phenomenological evidence comes , for example , from recently measured @xmath16 inclusive spectra related to @xmath17-formation in heavy nuclei @xcite which suggest a repulsive @xmath3-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "but also the theoretical interpretation of measured level shifts and widths of @xmath17 atoms @xcite requires a repulsive component of the @xmath3-nucleus potential .",
    "microscopic models of the @xmath5 interaction , fitted to @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering data , often fail to produce a repulsive @xmath3-nuclear potential .",
    "specifically , for models based on meson - exchange dynamics it is rather difficult to obtain such a repulsion as is witnessed by results of @xmath4-matrix calculations for various generations of the nijmegen @xmath5 potential @xcite .",
    "only the most recent version @xcite could overcome this difficulty @xcite - but at the expense of a noticeable increase in the achieved @xmath13 .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath5 potentials derived within a constituent quark model @xcite . here , the interaction in the @xmath18 partial wave of the @xmath19 @xmath12 channel is always strongly repulsive due to pauli blocking effects on the quark level  @xcite , and as direct consequence of this feature a repulsive @xmath3-nuclear potential is obtained in pertinent @xmath4-matrix calculations .",
    "interestingly , our leading order ( lo ) @xmath5 interaction , published in 2006 @xcite , predicted also a repulsive @xmath18 partial wave .",
    "calculations of the @xmath3 s.p .",
    "potential , performed by kohno with a low - energy equivalent representation @xcite , revealed that this interaction produces indeed a repulsive @xmath3-nuclear potential .",
    "the lo interaction involves only five contact terms and the lecs associated with them were determined in a fit to the low - energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections .",
    "no attention was paid to the sign of the @xmath19 @xmath12 amplitude in the @xmath18 partial wave .",
    "in the course of constructing the eft interaction @xcite up to nlo ( which involves altogether 13 lecs in the @xmath20 waves and the @xmath20@xmath21 transitions ) it turned out that the available @xmath5 scattering data could be fitted equally well with an attractive or a repulsive interaction in the @xmath18 partial wave of the @xmath19 @xmath12 channel .",
    "for the reasons discussed above , the repulsive solution was adopted .",
    "the resulting interaction produces a moderately repulsive @xmath18 phase shift as can be seen in fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "first @xmath4-matrix calculations for this interaction will be reported in the present work .",
    "it turns out that a repulsive @xmath3-nuclear potential is predicted .",
    "hypernuclear spectra provide clear indication for a rather weak @xmath2-nucleus spin - orbit potential @xcite . apparently , also this feature is difficult to reproduce with microscopic models of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "in particular , meson - exchange potentials tend to grossly overestimate the spin - orbit force , judging from applications of various nijmegen models in the studies presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "calculations based on @xmath5 interactions derived in the quark model lead to ( partially ) more promising results @xcite . according to the discussion of the strength of the spin - orbit potential in refs .",
    "@xcite , done on the level of the scheerbaum factor @xcite calculated from the @xmath4-matrix , there is a sizeable antisymmetric spin - orbit component generated from the quark model which cancels to a large extent the symmetric component in the @xmath0 isospin @xmath22 channel so that an overall weak spin - orbit potential is achieved .",
    "the aforementioned work by kohno @xcite provides also results for the scheerbaum factor for our lo @xmath5 potential .",
    "the predicted value was found to be fairly small and  somewhat surprisingly  of opposite sign as compared to results from standard potential models . at leading order",
    "there is no contact term that would give rise to an antisymmetric spin - orbit component .",
    "thus , the result at lo is a pure prediction based on the dynamics generated by pseudoscalar meson exchange .",
    "this is different at nlo where such a contact term occurs and facilitates @xmath23@xmath24 transitions in the coupled ( @xmath22 ) @xmath0@xmath1 system @xcite . since the corresponding lec could not be pinned down by a fit to the existing @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering data it was simply put to zero in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is interesting to see whether that lec can be fixed now from a study of the properties of the @xmath25 hyperon in nuclear matter and , specifically , whether it can be utilized to achieve a weak @xmath2-nuclear spin - orbit potential .",
    "this is indeed the case as will be demonstrated in the present work .",
    "note that the same issues have been addressed by kaiser and weise @xcite within an approach similar to ours , but on a perturbative level .",
    "it was found that the iterated ( second order ) one - pion exchange ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 intermediate states ) gives rise to a repulsive @xmath26-nuclear potential .",
    "note that dimensional regularization has been employed to extract the genuine long - range components .",
    "second - order pion exchange plays also a decisive role for the spin - orbit force , where it is argued that its contribution counterbalances the short - range components due to the scalar and vector mean fields to a large extent in case of the @xmath25 and , accordingly , leads to a small net result for the @xmath25-nuclear spin - orbit force .",
    "the same mechanism is at work for the @xmath3-nuclear spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "an analogous calculation where , in addition , contributions involving the decuplet baryons @xmath27 and @xmath28 were considered @xcite led to the same conclusions concerning the @xmath25-nuclear spin - orbit force .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 the formalism employed for evaluating the @xmath4-matrix is outlined .",
    "3 provides a basic introduction to our eft @xmath5 potentials .",
    "specifically , the implementation of the antisymmetric spin - orbit force and its impact on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 results are discussed .",
    "results of our calculation are presented and analysed in sect .",
    "besides those based on our chiral eft interactions , predictions for three meson - exchange potentials ( developed by the jlich and nijmegen groups , respectively ) are included for illustration purposes .",
