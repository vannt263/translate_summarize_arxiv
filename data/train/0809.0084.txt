    "aspect ( 3 ) is the `` v - rule '' : a convex ( @xmath41 corner of the thin rhombus in the ( 2.45 ) h or b tile can only adjoin a concave ( @xmath42 corner of the b or s tile , and vice versa .",
    "this ties together the hbs tiling and the co supertiling , requiring that every co - co edge have a fat hexagon around it .",

    "there were two key diagnostics for our initial identification of the key interactions for matching rules .",
    "first , we compared the contributions of each pair distance @xmath19 to the total energy as a function of temperature ( table  [ table : alco - pot ] ) .",

    "the penrose rules are still satisfied whereas at @xmath53    one gets an hbs tiling but no matching rules , confirming independently that hbs formation is due to nearest - neighbor bonds but matching rules come from second - neighbor bonds . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath52   and internal al s are removed from all tiles ,   , the correct fat - fat rule is _ still _ upheld , presumably by al(a)-co interactions at @xmath54 . ]",

    "[ sec : mrules ] to the `` @xmath55 '' atoms in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbs - inf ] and similar al .",
    "aspect ( 4 ) of the ordering  the final stage  is to satisfy penrose arrows on the remaining fat rhombus edges ( two on every hexagon and boat ) .",
    "let s focus now on the fat rhombus / fat rhombus matching rule , the crucial aspect ( 4 ) of the ordering process . to check the energy cost of a fat / fat violation , which depends on the internal al in those fat rhombi",
    ", we reformulate the matching - rule problem in terms of the 4.0   _ supertiles _ , in which arrows are defined on every edge by the al atom position .",
    "a given supertiling can be broken into hbs tiles in several ways , corresponding to different arrowings of its edges .",
    "note that usually ( as in our 2.45 - hbs tiling ) , the degrees of freedom are in the tiles , and possible mismatches occur along tile - tile edges ; whereas in the 4.0 - hbs model , each edge is an independent degree of freedom , and the possible mismatches occur between two edges in the same tile . ( the same was true for the near - matching - rule of @xmath56(alcuco )",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the co - co network has 4.46   bonds , along supertile edges , and 4.67   bonds .",
    "all of the latter relate endpoints of a @xmath57 supertile corner ( e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbs - inf](c ) ) .",
    "assuming the v - rule , [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : hbs - inf](a , b , c ) ] , that makes five bonds per ( small ) b and five per small s tile . hence , if the h - b - s content is fixed ( as implied by the v - rule ) , the number of 4.67   co - co bonds is fixed and they do not contribute to the matching rule .",
    "( that same number , in the super tiling , is 2 per h , 3 per b , and 5 per s tile , so the super hbs content is also constrained . )",
    "what supertiles are possible ?",
    "a corollary of the v - rule is that , at any @xmath58 [ resp .",
    "@xmath59 corner , both arrows point out from [ resp . into ] the corner .",
    "the other constraint is that no interior space be left after a supertile s border is decorated by hbs tiles ( filling an interior always violates the v - rule ) .",
    "the conclusion is we can have the super - h , b , and s tiles , or the `` pillow '' tile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbs - inf](e ) ( or extensions of it by adding more segments of alternating @xmath60 and @xmath61 corners . )",
    "so let s consider the super - boat tile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hbs - inf ] ) ( d ) ) . the v - rule leaves undetermined whether the two edges marked `` ? '' both point to the same corner ( as shown ) or are flipped with one in and one out ( this version violates the penrose rule ) . depending on the choice for the first arrow ,",
    "we either have al at @xmath62 and @xmath63 , or else at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; similarly the primed sites depend on the second arrow .",
    "the energy difference between the options for first arrow depends on 16 possible interactions between sites @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the fixed atoms marked 1,2,3,4 .",
    "( several other fixed atoms interact , but they are symmetrically placed relative to the flip , so they ca nt affect the energy difference . ) in addition , there are four interactions between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , however we must exclude those that connect two sites on the same tile .",
    "( that term was counted already in the energy per tile , and as noted earlier the total counts of h , b , and s tiles were fixed by the v - rule . )    here are the biggest contributions ( energies are in table  [ table : alco - pot ] ) : either option makes one al - co(4.67 ) bond ; the `` right '' way also gets two al - co(4.47 )  quite favorable  and one al - al(2.89 )  very unfavorable ; the `` wrong '' way gets four al - al(3.85 ) and two al - al(3.79 ) which are unfavorable .",
    "the `` right '' way also makes eight al - al(4.47 )  favorable  versus just two for the `` wrong '' way .",
    "the net difference is 0.1825 ev in favor of the `` right '' way .",
    "preliminary numerical tests , correlating total energy with the number of matching rule violations , indicate a typical matching - rule defect ( of either kind ) actually costs the order of 0.1 ev .    next , consider the super hexagon .",
    "its side edge arrows are free to point either way , but a calculation like that for the boat says these arrows are favored to be parallel , which is the proper penrose arrowing of a boat . finally , the v - rule permits just one possible arrowing on the super - pillow tile ( fig .  [ fig : hbs - inf ] ) , which forces a fat - fat rhombus violation in the middle associated with unfavorable al - al distances .",
    "hence we expect this tile loses out to the super - star ( which carries the same count of 2.45   hbs tiles ) .    plus2 mm",
    "the matching rules are mostly implemented by al - co interaction at @xmath68     and @xmath69   ; however , they are a resultant of many terms , and the cost of a rule violation seems to be context - dependent ( especially with our standard potential cutoff at @xmath70 , which includes the third well . ) fortunately , as seen in the example of sec .  [",
    "sec : mrules ] , this is nt a `` frustrated '' problem : most contributions have the same signs .",
    "we checked the cost @xmath71 of a rule violation : a fit of total energy versus number of violations ( counted by hand ) in 10 low - energy configurations ( from @xmath72k ) gave @xmath73ev .",
    "if we took a ( near ) ground state and moved the violation along a `` worm '' by local hbs flips , however , the cost was @xmath74ev , suggesting the minimum four violations forced by periodic boundary conditions had found sites where their cost was anomalously low .",
    "the matching rule depends on having the exact ratio of h : b : s tiles .",
    "that is a worry : by local flips , one can trade tiles @xmath75 or vice versa .",
    "let s define energies @xmath76 as the sum of interactions within each tile ( including a chemical potential @xmath77 , since a flip changes the number of al atoms ) .",
    "then one naively expects to maximize or minimize @xmath78 , depending whether @xmath79 is positive or negative , which would prevent reaching the right composition .",
    "but the tile - tile ( matching - rule ) interactions create a `` gap '' in al site energies so that running the reaction in _ either _ direction costs a positive energy .",
    "the rule also depends on having the right internal al decoration in every hbs tile .",
    "we studied the same model with al - ni : those potentials are quite similar to al - co ( except the al - ni attraction is not quite as strong as al - co ) .",
    "the penrose tiling may well be the ground state for al - ni  indeed , the _ constrained _ simulation behaves the same for al - co and al - ni  but it was less robust in the _ unconstrained _ simulation : e.g. , b tiles with just one internal al on the mirror axis are metastable .    as a reality check",
    ", we note that according to pair potentials , the ( relaxed ) matching - rule structure is unstable by 69.9 mev / atom compared to the tie - line between al@xmath80co@xmath81 ( 19% co ) and other competing phases . [ for this calculation we used the optimal `` half - constrained '' simulation result for the same size as fig .  [",
    "fig : bestalco ] . ]",
    "the ( relaxed ) ab - initio energy , using the vasp package  @xcite , came out unstable by 98.5 mev / atom .",
    "for comparison , the best al - co structure models  @xcite are @xmath82 mev / atom above the tie - line . in typical decagonal approximants , the energy is reduced @xmath83mev / atom after al atoms are allowed to `` pucker '' out of the layers ( doubling the @xmath84 axis to 8 ) , and to organize the proper correlations between the puckerings of nearby atoms .",
    "we have not yet investigated puckering in the present system , which would require molecular - dynamics simulation followed by relaxation  @xcite .",
    "we also attempted to make our structure more realistic by going to a ternary , having recognized that the internal sites in hbs tiles ( besides the interior vertex ) are always `` problem sites '' in al - transition metal decagonals .",
    "( e.g. , those are the atoms that `` pucker ''  @xcite . ) the root problem is that the two al in one boat are a bit overpacked , in view of the al - al hardcore distance .",
    "could we fill these sites with ( somewhat smaller ) cu atoms ?",
    "no : when we tried an al - cu - co ternary ( with pair potentials ) , cu atoms entered hexagons forming cuco pairs ( as seen earlier in ref .",
