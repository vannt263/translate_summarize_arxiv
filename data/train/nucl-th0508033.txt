    "since newton@xcite and leibniz@xcite introduced the concept of infinitesimal calculus , differentiating a function with respect to the variable @xmath0 is a standard technique applied in all branches of physics .",
    "the differential operator @xmath1 ,    @xmath2    transforms like a vector , its contraction yields the laplace - operator @xmath3 which is a second order derivative operator , the essential contribution to establish a wave equation , which is the starting point to describe several kinds of wave phenomena .    until now",
    ", the differential operator has only been used in integer steps .",
    "we want to extend the idea of differentation to arbitrary , not necessarily integer steps .",
    "a natural generalization is to search for an operator @xmath4 by setting @xmath5 where @xmath6 are integers .",
    "formally , this is solved by extracting the @xmath7-th root @xmath8 or , even more general , we will introduce a continuous differential operator by @xmath9 with @xmath10 beeing a positive , real number .    in order to derive a specific representation for the operator @xmath4",
    ", we introduce a very simple set of basis functions : @xmath11 differentiation of these functions is well defined for the integer case .",
    "it is just a multiplication with an appropriate factor and a linear reduction of the exponent .",
    "this procedure can easily be extended to the continuous case .",
    "the solution is inspired by a similar problem , which already has been solved in mathematical history : the extension of the interpretation of the faculty function @xmath12 to real numbers , which resulted in the famous euler gamma function @xmath13 , which is widely used in many different areas of analysis .",
    "thus , the definition for the continuous derivative is :    @xmath14    the set of functions @xmath15 is sufficient to span a hilbert space .    using the above definition",
    ", we are able to quantize the hamiltonian of a classical particle and solve the corresponding schroedinger equation .",
    "we define the following set of conjugated operators @xmath16 which satisfy the following commutator relations @xmath17 = 0 , [ p_i , p_j ] = 0 , [ x_i , p_j ] = -i \\hbar \\delta_{ij}\\ ] ] with these operators , the classical , non relativistic hamilton function @xmath18 @xmath19 is quantized .",
    "this yields the hamiltonian h @xmath20 thus , a time dependent schroedinger type equation for continuous differential operators results @xmath21 for @xmath22 this reduces to the classical schroedinger equation .",
    "we will now present the free particle solutions for this equation .",
    "we can do this , since for @xmath23 the commutator @xmath24 $ ] vanishes and consequently , energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "we extend the definition for the standard series expansion for the sine and cosine function @xmath25 with this definition , the following relations hold @xmath26    free particle solutions for the continuous differential operator schroedinger type equation , for different values of @xmath10 , @xmath27 .",
    "solid lines are @xmath28 , dashed lines @xmath29 . for @xmath22 solutions",
    "reduce to the standard @xmath30 and @xmath31 functions .",
    "for @xmath32 these functions are increasingly located at @xmath33,title=\"fig:\",width=480,height=288 ] +    it follows from these relations , that this functions are the eigenfunctions of the free schroedinger type equation . in the stationary case",
    "we get the energy relation @xmath34    in figure 1 the functions @xmath29 and @xmath28 are plotted for different values of @xmath10 . while for @xmath22 , these functions reduce to the known @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are spread over the whole x - region , for @xmath32 these functions become more and more located at @xmath33 and oscillations are damped , a behaviour , which we know e.g. from the airy - functions .",
    "let us make this observation more plausible : for any free particle solution @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath7 odd , which obeys the differential equation @xmath37 differentiating @xmath38 times we obtain : @xmath39 this corresponds to an additional , impulse dependent potential with a leading linear term for similar solutions of the classical schroedinger equation ( @xmath40 .",
    "thus , as the main result of our derivations so far , free particle solutions for @xmath41 are localized in space .",
    "consequently , if there are particles , which show such an behaviour in nature , a schroedinger equation with continuous derivatives could be a useful tool for a description .    in order to obtain more properties of the continuous differential operator schroedinger equation , we will now calculate the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator .",
    "we define the generators of infinitesimal rotations in the @xmath42-plane ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 is the number of particles ) : @xmath45 since @xmath46 = 0 $ ] , angular momentum is conserved .",
    "commutator relations for @xmath47 are isomorph to a @xmath48 algebra : @xmath49 =   i \\hbar ( \\delta_{i    m    } l_{j    n    } + \\delta_{j",

    "m    } - \\delta_{i    n    } l_{j    m    } - \\delta_{j    m    } l _ { i   n    } ) \\ ] ] consequently , we can proceed in a standard way @xcite , by defining the casimir - operators @xmath50 which indeed fulfill relations @xmath51 = 0 $ ] and successively @xmath52 = 0 $ ] .",
    "their explicit form is given by @xmath53 now we introduce a generalization of the homogenous euler operator for continuous differential operators @xmath54 with the generalized euler operator the casimir - operators are : @xmath55 now we define a hilbert space @xmath56 of all homogenous polynoms of degree @xmath57 , which satisfy the laplace equation @xmath58 : @xmath59 on this hilbert space , the generalized euler operator @xmath60 is diagonal and has the eigenvalues @xmath61 we want to emphasize , that these eigenvalues are different from the degree of homogenity in the general case @xmath62 , or , in other words : only in the case of @xmath22 homogenity degree @xmath63 of the polynoms considered coincides with the eigenvalues of @xmath64 .",
    "once the eigenvalues of the generalized euler operator are known , the eigenvalues of the casimir - operators @xmath65 are known , too : @xmath66 with @xmath67 for the case of only one particle ( @xmath68 ) , we can introduce the quantum numbers j and m , which now denote the j - th or m - th eigenvalue of the euler operator .",
    "the eigenfunctions are fully determined by these two quantum numbers @xmath69    with the definitions @xmath70 and @xmath71 it follows @xmath72 please note the fact , that in the case @xmath62 @xmath73 has no negative eigenvalues .",

    "are not equally spaced any more , instead stepsize is strongly reduced .",
    "since the euler operator eigenvalues contribute quadratically into the definition @xmath78 , the energy of higher total angular momenta is reduced increasingly .",
    "we have derived the full spectrum of the angular momentum operator for the continuous differential operator schroedinger type wave equation by use of standard algebraic methods .",
    "we expect additional information about the properties of this wave equation , if we consider its linearized pendant .",
    "we present some results in the next section .",
    "linearization of a second order wave equation was first considered by dirac@xcite .",
    "we propose a generalization of his approach , starting with a linear version of the wave equation , which is iterated @xmath7 times , roughly : @xmath81 this is formally solved by taking the @xmath7-th root : @xmath82 a new property is revealed via linearization : a phase factor , which may not be neglected .",
    "if @xmath7 is an integer , @xmath7 different phase factors exist , which have to be incorporated within the definition of @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , @xmath83 may be interpreted as a matrix with at least @xmath84 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath83 matrices obey an extended clifford algebra ( @xmath85 means all permutations ) : @xmath86 this equation is fulfilled by a set of hermitean , traceless @xmath87 matrices , which built at least a subspace of su(m ) .    finally , we can distinguish two distinct parts of linarization .",
    "if spacelike components are linearized ( @xmath88 ) , an additional su(m ) symmetry is introduced , which has been demonstrated for the case @xmath89 by levy - leblond by linearizing the ordinary schroedinger equation to get an additional su(2 ) symmetry@xcite . for a single linearized timelike component , we obtain @xmath7 different energy values , which are interpreted as @xmath7 different particles .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", a continuous differential operator may be interesting for any value of p , a physicist may first concentrate on @xmath90 , because there is a simple interpretation of the physical properties described by such a wave function .",
    "we want to emphasize , that @xmath91 seems to be the most promising candidate for a physical interpretation :    it matches a triple iteration of a linear wave equation , which shows a direct connection to su(3 ) and provides a description for up to 3 particles simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , as we have already shown , particles are automatically confined in space .    summarizing all these facts , we assume , that the continuous differential operator schroedinger type wave equation with @xmath79 is an appropriate candidate for a non relativistic description of particles with quark - like properties .",

    "we have developed a new theoretical concept , which fulfills at least the following three demands : first , available experimental data will be reproduced with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "second , it will give new insights on underlying symmetries and properties of the objects under consideration .",
    "third , we will make predictions , which can be proven by experiment .",
    "none of our results , presented so far , does require any information from qcd or a similar theory .",
    "all our statements could have been made in the 1930ies already , even though they would have been highly speculative .",
    "today , we are in the comfortable position , that there are enough experimental data , our predictions can be compared with .",
    "a promising candidate is the charmonium spectrum@xcite .    in the upper part of figure 2 we have displayed all",
    "experimentally observed charmonium - states with experimental masses , which are normally compared with results from a potential model , which tries to simulate confinement and attraction by fitting a model potential@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we will assume , that this spectrum is a single particle spectrum for a particle , whose properties are described by the continuous differential operator schroedinger equation([schroedinger ] ) with @xmath79 .",
    "we suppose , the system is rotating in a minimally coupled field , which causes a constant magnetic field b. this leads to the following hamiltonian h or mass formula @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and b will be adjusted to the experimental data .",
    "the eigenfunctions are modified spherical harmonics with @xmath97 , the eigenvalues for @xmath78 and @xmath73 are given by ( [ eqlz]),([eqj2 ] ) and are listed in table 1 .    in figure 2",
    "we have sketched the resulting level scheme and the quantum numbers @xmath98 for every particle .",
    "we have to prove , that this leads to correct results .",
    "the first crucial test is the verification of the correct value of the non trivial @xmath89 quantum number which corresponds to the @xmath99 eigenvalue of the generalized euler operator . for the set of @xmath100-particles ,",

    "indeed , there exists an appropriate candidate , the @xmath109 particle @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this result supports our theory , since it is a second occurance of the @xmath89 eigenvalue of the generalized euler operator .",
    "in addition , it supports the idea , that the energy levels of the spectrum are labeled correctly .    finally , the minimal difference of only @xmath110 $ ] , which is mainly due to the uncertainty of the @xmath103 experimental mass , between predicted and experimental mass of the @xmath109 particle indicates , that the assumed so(3 ) symmetry is fulfilled exactly .    as a last step , we need to determine the value of @xmath111 . from the experimental data , we observe a slight dependence on @xmath112 , which we will ignore for sake of simplicity . instead ,",

    "of course , if we add an additional @xmath136 term to the proposed mass formula , we can shift these levels by the necessary amount .",
