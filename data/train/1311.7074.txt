    "indeed , color confinement is one of the main open problems in theoretical physics .",
    "the standard perturbative approach to avoid overcounting of gauge equivalent configurations in yang - mills ( ym ) theory is to introduce a gauge fixing condition in the functional integral ( the landau gauge will be considered in the following ) .",
    "however , as gribov pointed out @xcite , the landau gauge condition does not fix the gauge completely .",
    "shortly after , singer showed that , due to the non - trivial nature of the fiber bundle structure of ym - theory , any true gauge condition presents this obstruction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of gribov copies close to the identity induces the existence of non - trivial zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator , which make the path integral ill defined .",
    "even when perturbation theory around vacuum is not affected by gribov ambiguity when ym - theory is defined over a flat space - time with trivial topology @xcite , gribov copies have to be taken into account when considering more general cases @xcite or when non - perturbative phenomena are studied .",
    "the most effective method to eliminate gribov copies ( proposed by gribov himself in @xcite and refined in @xcite ) corresponds to restricting the path integral to the so - called gribov region , which is the region in the functional space of gauge potentials over which the faddeev - popov operator is positive definite . in @xcite dellantonio and",
    "zwanziger showed that all the orbits of the theory intersect the gribov region , indicating that no physical information is lost when implementing this restriction .",
    "even though this region still contains copies with non - trivial winding number @xcite , this restriction has remarkable effects .",
    "in fact , the gluon propagator is suppressed in the infrared and the ghost propagator is enhanced , which has opened a way to understand color confinement @xcite .",
    "a local and renormalizable effective action for ym - theory whose dynamics is restricted to the gribov horizon and that yields the same results for the field propagators was constructed in @xcite by adding extra fields to the action .",
    "later , an improved action was proposed by considering suitable condensates , which leads to propagators and glueball masses in agreement with the lattice data @xcite . with the same action",
    ", one can also solve the old problem of the casimir energy in the mit - bag model @xcite .",
    "even though it is an experimental fact that quarks and gluons are confined and color charged states are unobservable as asymptotic states at low temperatures , it is expected that at high temperatures ( @xmath0 mev ) they become free @xcite .",
    "such a phase transition from confinement to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) should be described within the framework of finite - temperature field theory allowing a better understanding of natural scenarios as the early universe or compact star physics @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature sector for the theory corresponds to the perturbative region , in which gluons are physical states . in this regime",
    "it is necessary to include thermal loop corrections , which may yield a dynamical thermal mass generation for the gauge fields @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the hard thermal loop approximation cancels infrared divergences coming from the matsubara frequencies , allowing one to study plasma oscillations . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice qcd allows one to handle non - perturbative phenomena at finite temperature , such as phase transitions .",
    "the critical temperature for qgp has been subject of several studies as well as its relation with the energy scale in the context of quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "moreover , some recent analyses ( see , in particular , @xcite and references therein ) strongly support the existence of an intermediate regime which lies in between the confined phase and the free phase . within this regime ,",
    "some features of the confined phase coexist with the high - temperature plasma phase .",
    "although it is not clear yet whether this intermediate phase corresponds to a phase transition or to a cross - over , it can be safely assumed that such an intermediate regime does appear .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze the semi - classical gribov approach to qcd at finite temperature extending the pioneering works @xcite .",
    "to this aim , the finite - temperature theory at one loop will be restricted to the gribov region and the existence of phase transitions from confinement to gluon plasma will be analyzed . since gluon deconfinement is associated to the presence of dynamical thermal mass @xcite , the contribution of thermal loops to the finite - temperature analysis can not be ignored when implementing this restriction .",
    "the semi - classical gribov analysis shed considerable light on the non - perturbative behavior of the gluon propagator .",
    "indeed , at zero temperature , the existence of a non - trivial solution to the gribov gap equation implies that the gluon propagator has imaginary poles and consequently gluons do not belong to the physical spectrum .",
    "hence , there are two important requirements that the finite - temperature gap equation must satisfy .",
    "firstly , the finite - temperature gap equation should have , when the temperature is low enough , solutions close to the zero - temperature one , describing confined gluons . secondly , when the temperature is high enough , the finite - temperature gap equation should describe propagating gluons .",
    "although it is not easy to satisfy both conditions @xcite , here we will show that not only they can be satisfied , but also that the finite - temperature gap equation discloses the presence of a new regime in between the confined and free regimes , which appears to be closely related to the intermediate regime mentioned before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ semi - classical - gribov - approach - qcd ] the quantization of ym - theory and the semi - classical gribov approach at zero temperature are briefly reviewed following the lines of @xcite . in section",
    "[ finite - temperature - analysis ] the main considerations for the one - loop finite temperature analysis are exposed , and a thermal gap equation is derived .",

    "we look at the connected two - point ghost function generated by ( [ z1 ] ) : @xmath21 singularities in ( [ gt ] ) correspond to zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator , i.e. infinitesimal gribov copies . in the momentum representation ,",
    "singularities different from @xmath22 imply that @xmath23 can become negative definite , and therefore it is evaluated outside the gribov horizon .",

    ", we apply the prescription ( [ f ] ) to ( [ gap3 ] ) and take the infinite spatial volume limit @xmath84 finally , replacing the thermal gluon mass ( [ m ] ) , we obtain the following thermal gap equation : @xmath85 where we have adopted polar coordinates , integrated over angular variables , and  we defined a radial integration limit @xmath47 , which corresponds to an ultraviolet cutoff .",

    "as we have shown in section [ finite - temperature - analysis ] , the effective gluon propagator ( [ prop2 ] ) can lead to three different regimes for gluons depending on the value of the thermal mass @xmath94 , which in turn depends on the temperature @xmath95 .",
    "these three regimes can be associated to two transition temperatures . in this section",
    "we present the numerical analysis of the gap equation ( [ gap6 ] ) for qcd ( @xmath96 ) in the high - temperature regime and subsequently we study a possible infrared continuation .",
    "let us consider the thermal gap equation in the limit of high temperatures @xmath97 . in finite - temperature qcd ,",
    "the one - loop running coupling depends on the temperature @xmath95 ( or , in our case , on @xmath92 ) as @xcite @xmath98 where we have defined the ratio between the cutoff @xmath47 and the energy scale @xmath99 as @xmath100 for the left hand side of ( [ gap6 ] ) , we define the function @xmath101 then the solution for the gap equation corresponds to the intersection of the curves @xmath102 with @xmath103 . in order to obtain the qualitative behavior for the solutions",
    ", we will consider @xmath104 in the analysis below ( as it will be explained later on , the qualitative behavior of the gluon propagator does not depend on the value of @xmath105 ) . from figure [ caso1a ]",
    ", we see that the existence of solution depends on the temperature .",
    "in fact , the intersection occurs for @xmath92 s below a critical value @xmath106 , see figure [ caso1b ] .",
    "this corresponds to a phase transition at temperature @xmath107            for @xmath108 there is no solution for the gap equation ( [ gap6 ] ) . in this case",
    "the only consistent choice for the gribov parameter is @xmath82 , indicating that this regime represents the free phase . on the other hand , for @xmath109",
    ", there is a solution for the gap equation , which define the gribov parameter @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , as is shown in figure [ gamma_vs_lambda_logaritmica ] , @xmath110 decreases as @xmath92 increases and vanishes for @xmath111 .",
    "even though for @xmath112 there is a solution for the gap equation , the propagator is still not completely confining . as we saw in section",
    "[ finite - temperature - analysis ] , depending on the sign of the discriminant in ( [ poles ] ) , a partial or total confinement can take place . in this case , the change of sign in ( [ poles ] ) occurs for @xmath113 ( see figure [ discriminant_vs_lambda_logaritmica ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath114 hence , two phase transitions are found as the temperature decreases : a deconfined / partially deconfined phase transition at @xmath115 and a partially deconfined / confined phase transition at @xmath116 . in the intermediate phase , only one degree of freedom of the gluon field is physical , as discussed in section [ poles_propagator ] .      in order to extend the analysis of the previous subsection to the low - temperature regime",
    ", we need a prescription to extend the definition ( [ g3 ] ) for @xmath117 .",
    "a way to extend the running coupling to the infrared regime in zero - temperature qcd has been developed in @xcite in the framework of quark - antiquark potentials by adding a non - perturbative contribution to the wilson loop . in the finite - temperature case ,",
    "the analog extension reads@xmath118 this expression reduces to ( [ g3 ] ) for large @xmath92 but , in the limit @xmath119 the running coupling reduces to the bare coupling constant @xmath3@xmath120 this choice is also consistent with the fact that the thermal gluon mass ( [ m ] ) must vanish as @xmath95 goes to zero@xmath121 which is a necessary requirement to reduce ( [ gap3 ] ) to ( [ gap_t=0 ] ) in this limit and to connect consistently with the standard @xmath122 results @xcite .",
    "let us note that for large @xmath3 the behavior of @xmath123 becomes insensible to small variations of @xmath3 itself ; see figure [ caso2_g ] .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that in quantum field theory bare quantities are infinite but unobservable and they need to be renormalized .        replacing the expression ( [ coupling2 ] ) ( with @xmath104 ) in the gap equation ( [ gap6 ] ) , the left hand side takes the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is obtained replacing ( [ coupling2 ] ) in ( [ s ] ) .",
    "then the solution for the gap equation again corresponds to the intersection of the curves @xmath126 and @xmath103 , whose existence depends on @xmath92 ( see figure [ caso2a ] ) .",
    "similarly to the previous subsection , we find two phase transitions .",
    "choosing @xmath127 , the deconfined / partially deconfined phase transition occurs for the critical value @xmath128 ( see figures [ caso2b ] and [ gamma_vs_lambda ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath129 while the partially deconfined / confined phase transition now occurs for @xmath130 ( see figure [ discriminant_vs_lambda ] ) , i.e. , @xmath131            the results obtained with the prescription ( [ coupling2 ] ) are very similar to the ones obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "it is important to note that the qualitative behavior of the solution of the gap equation and the gluon propagator does not depend on the value of @xmath105 in the definition ( [ a ] ) . as we can see in table [ table_alpha ] , the greater the value of @xmath105 that we consider in the analysis ( i.e. the greater the cutoff @xmath47 compared with qcd scale @xmath99 ) , the greater will be the numerical values for the critical temperatures for the phase transitions .",
    "hence , the fact that the integration cutoff @xmath47 is much higher than the qcd scale @xmath99 implies that the critical temperatures obtained with this method , when considering a more realistic ratio between this quantities , will be greater than the values obtained in this section .",

    "in this paper it has been shown that the semi - classical gribov approach applied to finite - temperature ym - theory is consistent with the presence of a confined / deconfined phase transition .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the existence of solutions of the gribov the gap equation depends on the temperature .",
    "a key ingredient for the consistent description of these different regimes is the inclusion of a mass term in the gluon propagator , which comes from the one - loop corrections to the theory . indeed ,",
    "if the mass term is not taken into account , there are no critical temperatures at all and one would be left with confined gluons at all the temperatures .",
    "furthermore , to include one - loop corrections is consistent with the fact that the thermal mass ( [ m ] ) causes gluon deconfinement @xcite .    in order to be able to study the low - temperature limit ,",
    "we have introduced a modified running coupling @xmath59 , which interpolates between the standard perturbative result in the ultraviolet regime and a constant ( in principle infinite but unobservable ) for the infrared regime .",
    "it is worth to note that this modification has been considered only for consistency , as it allows the gluon thermal mass to go to zero for low temperature , but the presence of these phase transitions does not depend on this fact .",
    "indeed , the same qualitative behavior for the gluon propagator was obtained when considering the standard one - loop running coupling ( [ g3 ] ) and , furthermore , it can be shown that phase transitions are also present if only a constant coupling is considered in the whole analysis .",
    "we stress that when the gribov semi - classical method is implemented at zero temperature but with a non - trivial higgs field ( see @xcite ) , the phase diagram turns out to be very close to the one obtained in the present paper in agreement with the fradkin - shenker theorem @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered the scaling solution , in which the gluon propagator vanishes and the ghost propagator blows up as @xmath135 in the infrared limit @xmath52 . on the other hand , it is clear by now that the decoupling solution ( where the gluon propagator goes to a constant in the infrared limit while the ghost propagator has a free - like behavior ) is the relevant one @xcite .",
    "the decoupling solution has a strong lattice support @xcite and can be obtained analytically within the refined gribov - zwanziger theory by including some condensates @xcite .",
    "it would certainly be of interest to study the refined gribov - zwanziger approach at finite temperature .",
    "however , as this theory includes extra ghost fields necessary to express the action in a local form , the main technical problem when passing to the finite - temperature formalism is to determine the boundary conditions that these extra fields must satisfy .",
    "this issue is under investigation and we hope to come back to this point in the future .    an interesting result of this paper is the appearance of an intermediate regime in between the confined and free regimes , in which only one of the two gluonic degrees of freedom is physical , while the other one does not belong to the physical spectrum . in this sense",
    ", this new regime captures traces of both confined and deconfined regimes .",
    "hence , this scenario could be interpreted as a partial deconfinement or a semi - qgp phase , which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "regimes of this kind can appear when studying qgp by different methods .",
    "in fact , in a very interesting paper @xcite the phase transition in hot qcd is analyzed in the context of electrically and magnetically charged quasi - particles , where the confined regime corresponds to a magnetically dominated and electrically confined region while the free regime is described by a magnetically strongly correlated and electrically dominated region . in between these regimes , a `` postconfined '' region is found , where electrically charged excitations are strongly correlated , which can also be interpreted as a partial deconfinement .",
    "it is reassuring that , even though this method is quite different from our approach , the qualitative results are in agreement with ours , as far as the presence of an intermediate regime is concerned .    despite the fact that pure yang - mills theory is interesting in itself ,",
    "the inclusion of quarks is important in order to obtain a more realistic model .",
    "this point requires a careful analysis since , as has been shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the quark propagator develops complex poles at the non - perturbative level in the same way as the gluon propagator does after implementing the gribov restriction .",
    "according to the analysis for a propagator with complex poles given in section [ poles_propagator ] , the fact that the quark and gluon propagators share this feature in the infrared strongly suggests that there could exist an intermediate quark regime as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermodynamics of quark models with complex mass poles have been studied in @xcite and it would be interesting to follow its lines when adding quarks to the gribov - zwanziger theory .",
    "the study of the equation of state for gluons , both in the semi - classical gribov approach and the gribov - zwanziger theory , as well as the inclusion of quarks , presents several technical difficulties at the analytical and numerical level , and they are currently under investigation .    another important subject in the understanding of deconfinement , which is also the aim of a future work , is the order of the phase transition . in order to formally associate each regime of section [ phase_transition ] with a phase of a gluon plasma and",
    "prove rigorously that the critical temperatures that we have found determine a phase transition , an order parameter must be introduced .",
    "the natural choice for the order parameter in finite - temperature formalism is the polyakov loop , and its computation for the intermediate phase found in section [ poles_propagator ] would shed light on its relation with partial deconfinement and semi - qgp . on the other hand ,",
    "as has been explained in @xcite , the polyakov loop is very useful when dealing with non - trivial thermodynamics arising in the presence of complex mass poles .",
