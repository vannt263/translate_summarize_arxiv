    ", the mixing parameters will be measured on a 10 % level  @xcite .",
    "thus we are entering an era of precision experiments in neutrino physics .",
    "contrarily , there have been a lot of attempts to explain the structure of the neutrino mass matrix ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "however , most models use heavy particles which generate light neutrino masses effectively after decoupling .",

    "therefore , the neutrino masses given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw],[eq : seesawtriplet ] ) are subject to quantum corrections , i.e.  they are modified by renormalization group ( rg ) running .",
    "the running of neutrino masses and leptonic mixing angles has been studied intensely in the literature .",
    "rg effects can be very large for a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass hierarchy and they can have interesting implications for model building .",
    "for instance , leptonic mixing angles can be magnified  @xcite , the small mass splittings can be generated from exactly degenerate light neutrinos  @xcite or bimaximal mixing at high energy can be made compatible with low - energy experiments  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , even rather small rg corrections are important in view of the precision era we are entering .",
    "for example , rg effects induce deviations from @xmath5 or maximal mixing @xmath6  @xcite also for a hierarchical spectrum , as well as from other symmetries , like quark - lepton - complementarity  @xcite , tribimaximal mixing  @xcite and other special configurations  @xcite .",
    "threshold corrections can yield large effects  @xcite .",

    "there are also studies in the standard seesaw case  @xcite and in the case of dirac neutrinos  @xcite which also show significant rg effects which can become comparable to the precision of experimental data .",

    "however , this result can not immediately translated to a @xmath8 higgs triplet like in the type - ii seesaw mechanism , because the non - vanishing hypercharge leads to a coupling of the higgs triplet to the hypercharge boson , which in turn leads to different contributions to the electroweak precision observables , e.g. the mass of the @xmath9 boson receives additional corrections which results in corrections to the @xmath10 parameter .",
