    "it is undoubted that how to maximize diversity gain is one of the major concerns in both point - to - point communication systems and wireless networks . as for point - to - point communication systems ,",
    "remarkable progress has been witnessed in the field of stbc designs to achieve maximum diversity gain over the last decade . in particular ,",
    "some pioneering works are well known of the full - diversity criteria based on different types of receivers such as maximum likelihood ( ml ) and linear receivers @xcite .",
    "recently , the contributions aforementioned shed light on the stbc designs for wireless networks such as multiple access channels ( macs ) @xcite and x channels @xcite . for two - user macs , various cancellation schemes in @xcite were considered with the help of alamouti coding to suppress the interference from the neighboring user . in @xcite , a minimum mean squared error (",
    "mmse ) interference cancellation was developed when two receive antennas are equipped at each terminal .",
    "later , a family of interference cancellation schemes based on bayesian analysis was proposed in @xcite . then , @xcite analyzed the diversity order of alamouti and quasi - orthogonal stbc for multiuser mac with two decoding algorithms , i.e. , joint ml decoding and group zf decoding .",
    "it showed that for joint ml decoding full diversity is obtained and for the group zf decoding full diversity can not be achieved by alamouti and quasi - orthogonal stbc . in order to obtain an optimal power gain , the recent work in @xcite employed zf receiver to eliminate the interference .",
    "unfortunately , all the schemes in @xcite can not guarantee the maximum possible diversity order after interference cancellation . to achieve full diversity in macs ,",
    "the works in @xcite@xcite developed a particular precoder for each user with arbitrary number of transmit antenna .",
    "interference alignment was firstly proposed to suppress the interference and achieve the maximum degree of freedom ( dof ) in mimo interference and x channels @xcite . for two - user x channels , a full - diversity transmission scheme in @xcite",
    "is proposed by borrowing an idea from interference alignment in @xcite .",
    "different from the work in @xcite , the goal of @xcite is to achieve the maximum diversity order instead of the maximum dof in x channels .",
    "note that the inter - user interference was safely eliminated in @xcite , since it can be aligned into an orthogonal subspace to the desired signals with the aid of full channel state information at the transmitters ( csit ) . by doing so ,",
    "interference cancellation is realized without any side impact on the full diversity of the desired user . in practice , however , it is very hard for the transmitters to fully know the channel information .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider a full - diversity stbc design for wireless networks without csit .    in this paper , we propose a design criterion for an stbc to achieve full diversity in two - user mimo interference channels without csit , where the full diversity is defined for a single user pair , i.e. , the link between a transmitter and its corresponding receiver . since the receiver corresponding to the desired user knows nothing about the codebook of the interfering user , a straightforward way to eliminate the interference is using the group zf receiver , which was widely investigated and applied in space - time coded mimo systems @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "based on the design criterion , we propose a systematic stbc design for each user with multiple transmit antennas that can obtain full diversity after interference cancellation . for a fixed number of transmit antennas",
    "@xmath0 , the code rate approaches one when the time delay in the encoding ( or code block size ) gets large . in our paper , we focus on two - user interference channels where the codebooks of two users are not shared .",
    "hence , the joint ml decoding can not be used .",
    "compared to the work in @xcite , our contribution lies in the design of full diversity stbc for interference channels with the group zf decoding .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the main difference from the works in @xcite is that the channel information is unknown at the transmitter side such that in our paper the inter - user interference is canceled by using the group zf receiver instead of interference alignment . to our best knowledge",
    ", this is the first attempt of full diversity stbc design for two - user mimo interference channels without csit .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is outlined in section ii .",
    "then , a design criterion of stbc under the group zf receiver is given in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "a systematic stbc design is proposed for each user and the full diversity is proved when the group zf receiver is utilized .",
