    "with the advancement of high throughput technologies , it is now common to encounter high dimensional data with the number of parameters ( @xmath3 ) , often far exceeding the sample size ( @xmath4 ) . in this high dimensional",
    "setting it is often of interest to investigate relationships among thousands of variables .",
    "this paper is motivated by the recent surge in interest to understand the effects of microbiome on our external and internal environment and also on public health .",
    "for example , it is often of interest to understand the relationships among various bacterial populations and how such relationships may affect health outcomes . in some cases",
    "it may also be of interest in identifying microbial biomarkers which can classify subjects into two different populations using microbiome data .",
    "a detailed review of recent literature on this topic is provided by ( cf clemente et .",
    "al . , 2012 )    in order to address such scientific questions , one needs to first estimate the covariance matrix @xmath5 or its inverse , the precision matrix @xmath6 estimation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , when the dimension exceeds the sample size , i.e. @xmath9 has been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "the existing literature can be broadly classified into two categories , the first approach involves estimation of the precision matrix by exploiting its natural sparsity in comparison to the covariance matrix [ cf .. friedman , hastie and tibshirani , 2007 , cai , liu and luo , 2011 , and rothman , bickel , levina and zhu , 2008 ] .",
    "a limitation of this approach is that it does not apply to low rank matrices @xmath7 since the precision matrix does not exist in this case .",
    "the second popular approach is to estimate the @xmath7 by assuming that @xmath7 is itself sparse .",
    "one of several methods for this purpose is to threshold each element of the sample covariance matrix [ bickel and levina 2008 , and rothman , levina and zhu , 2009 ] .",
    "all papers mentioned above assume the availability of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) copies of the vector @xmath10 whose distribution is gaussian or more generally sub - gaussian with @xmath11 and @xmath7 as the @xmath3 dimensional mean vector and covariance matrix respectively .",
    "note that a real valued random variable @xmath12 is said to be sub - gaussian if there exists a @xmath13 such that for every @xmath14 one has @xmath15    in contrast to typical high dimensional data , not all variables ( i.e. microbes ) are observed in a microbial expression sample .",
    "thus if @xmath16 represents a @xmath3 dimensional vector of abundances of @xmath3 taxa in a specimen obtained from an ecosystem , then not all components of @xmath16 may be observed .",
    "we refer to this missingness as structural zeros and it is due to the underlying biology and not not due to error in measurement or values below the minimum detection level .",
    "for example , it is known that the bacterial genus _",
    "bacteroides _ is prevalent in the human gut when the associated diet is high protein / fat diet , whereas it may be completely absent otherwise , i.e. carbohydrate rich diet .",
    "the total abundance of such bacteria are coded as 0 counts in the observational vector @xmath16 .",
    "the missing structure required to model structural zeros is more general than typical notions of missingness in the literature .",
    "more precisely , in the classical notions of missingness , such as missing completely at random ( mcar ) or missing at random ( mar ) , it is assumed that in place of @xmath16 we observe a surrogate vector @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents a component - wise product and @xmath19 is a @xmath3-dimensional vector of independent bernoulli random variables . in effect",
    ", not all components of @xmath16 are observed in @xmath20 .",
    "for example , @xmath21 corresponds to the case where the first two components of @xmath22 are not observed in @xmath20 with @xmath23 in this example , although @xmath12 and @xmath24 are absent in @xmath25 they still influence the distribution of the remaining components @xmath26 through the underlying dependence structure of @xmath7 and are only hidden by the corresponding multiplicative bernoulli noise vector @xmath27 in contrast , for the case of structural zeros the observed vector itself is @xmath28 i.e. , the first two components are truly absent from the observation and thus the missing components should not influence the distribution of the remaining components .    in this paper",
    "we define a general framework which allows for structural zeros in the model and discuss consistent methods of estimating sparse high dimensional covariance and precision matrices under this setup . we establish consistency in estimation of the proposed methodology and",
    "empirically support it with a simulation study .",
    "we also apply our methodology to analyse the global human gut microbiome data of yatsunenko et .",
    "al . 2012 .",
    "estimation of covariance and precision matrices in the traditional missing values setting has also been discussed in the literature [ cf .",
    "loh and wainwright , 2012 ) and lounici , 2012 ] . as shall become apparent in the following",
    ", our model allows for a more general notion of missingness while assuming weaker conditions in comparison to typical notions of missingness .",
    "throughout the paper , for any @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 $ ] define the @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 norms as @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "also @xmath41 indicates the matrix @xmath42 is positive definite .",
    "we use @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 as generic constants which may change according to the context . for any set of indices",

    "a^ca^c    ) ,    we begin by describing a framework that characterizes structural zeros . as briefly stated in the introduction , these structural zeros represent components that are biologically absent in the specimen .",
    "hence , intuitively the framework should allow for the distribution of the specimen to be completely determined by only the observed components . restating this",
    "statistically , the distribution of an observation should be characterized conditional to the missing structure for each @xmath53 .",
    "hence we first define the missing structure .",
    "let the sample space @xmath54 of possible configurations of missing components in a given sample be as follows .",

    "we shall represent each of the above @xmath56 events of the sample space by configuration @xmath57 , @xmath58 , in the order written in ( ) . for example , configuration ( @xmath59 ) is the case where all components are observed and configuration @xmath60 corresponds to the configuration where only the first component is observed . for each sample @xmath61 , @xmath62 we assume that the missing structure is generated by independent random variables @xmath63 @xmath64 with sample space described in ( ) .    in many applications , it may be unreasonable to assume that the missingness is generated by identically distributed r.v.s .",
    "the distriubtion function may be influenced by factors or covariates such as geographical location , age , race and gender of the subject . to allow for this flexibility ,",
    "let @xmath65 @xmath53 be @xmath66-dimensional vectors of non - random covariates which can possibly influence the distribution of the missingness , more precisely , define the distribution of the random variables @xmath63 @xmath53 by , p(*m*_i is in configuration ( j ) ) = _ ( j)(*z*_i),0_(j)(*z*_i)1,1j2^d-1 . we now proceed to define the conditional distribution of the observed components of a specimen .",

    "when there are no covariates , ( i ) reduces to @xmath94 and ( ii ) reduces to @xmath95 .",
    "thus in this case , assumption * ( a1 ) * requires that each component is present in an observational vector with a nonzero probability and that every pair of components are present in each observational vector with a nonzero probability .",
    "in this section we derive the theoretical properties of two methodologies , a generalised thresholding procedure to estimate the covariance matrix @xmath7 and a @xmath96 minimisation approach to estimate the precision matrix @xmath97 we shall derive these properties under the structural zero s setup while allowing the dimension of the observed vector to increase exponentially with the sample size .",
