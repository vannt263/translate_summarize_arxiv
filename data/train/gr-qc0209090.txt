    "quantum theory in a black hole background has been extensively studied by many authors .",
    "detailed discussions of this problem are contained in the books by birrell & davies  @xcite and chandrasekhar  @xcite , and the review paper by brout _",
    "et al . _",
    "much of the attention in this work is focussed on the wave equation and its scattering properties .",
    "detailed studies of the dirac equation in a black hole background are less common .",
    "indeed , the lowest order scattering cross section for a fermion in a black hole background has only recently been computed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate another previously neglected aspect of quantum mechanics in a black hole background .",
    "this is the existence of the bound state spectrum for particles orbiting a spherically  symmetric point source .",
    "that is , we study the gravitational analogue of the hydrogen atom orbitals .",
    "there has been strangely little effort devoted to the study of the bound state spectrum , despite the fundamental importance of the electromagnetic analogue .",
    "but it is clear that these states must exist  how else can one provide a quantum description of a particle in orbit around a black hole ?",
    "these states must also be essential in the quantum description of the capture process .",
    "the problem was discussed in 1974 by deruelle and ruffini  @xcite , who described the existence of resonance states in the klein  gordon equation .",
    "further significant contributions were made in a series of papers by gaina and coauthors  @xcite .",
    "these papers give various analytic expressions for the real and imaginary parts of the energy in a series of limiting cases .",
    "much of the study of quantum mechanics in a black hole background has focussed on the related , though distinct , problem of finding the quasi - normal mode spectrum .",
    "quasi - normal modes are purely ingoing at the horizon , and outgoing at infinity  @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions produce a spectrum of eigenstates with complex - valued energies .",
    "the significance of these quasi - normal modes comes from their use in describing black hole oscillations .",
    "but the boundary condition at infinity implies that these modes are not normalizable , so can not represent bound states .",
    "the problem of interest here is to find these bound states , so we seek solutions which are purely ingoing at the horizon , and which fall off exponentially at infinity .    for a particle of mass @xmath2 in the field of a black hole of mass @xmath3 the dimensionless coupling strength is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the planck mass . in this paper",
    "we compute the fermion bound state spectra for @xmath6 in the range @xmath7 .",
    "if the bound particle is assumed to be an electron , this range corresponds to black holes of masses up to @xmath8 kg , which is the scale appropriate for primordial black holes formed in the early universe .",
    "computing the energy spectrum is more complicated than the hydrogen atom case for two main reasons .",
    "the first is that the radially - separated dirac equation contains three singular points , only two of which are regular .",
    "there is no special function theory appropriate for the study of such equations , so we have to resort to a range of numerical techniques to find the spectrum .",
    "the second problem is that the singularity at the centre of a schwarzschild black hole acts as a current sink .",
    "all normalizable states must therefore decay in time , and we must search for eigenstates over the two - dimensional space of complex energies .",
    "the states we construct therefore all have a finite half - life , so can be viewed as resonance states .",
    "the interpretation of these states is discussed in section  [ disc ] .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "the problem can be tackled numerically , and we present a range of results for the real and imaginary parts of the energy .",
    "these are sufficient to predict how the spectrum will behave for larger values of the coupling constant .",
    "the first result , which is entirely to be expected , is that the orbitals become increasingly tightly bound as the coupling increases .",
    "it follows that , for a given state , the energy will initially decrease with @xmath9 , but will eventually turn round and start increasing as the particle spends too much time inside the classical radius of minimum energy .",
    "states with higher angular momentum then become energetically favourable as @xmath9 increases . for example , we show that beyond @xmath10 the @xmath0 state is no longer the ground state . while the real part of the energy behaves in quite a complicated fashion , the imaginary part , which controls the decay rate , simply increases in magnitude .",
    "this is also as one would expect .",
    "the closer the orbital density is to the singularity , the greater the probability of capture .",
    "we start by discussing the dirac equation in a schwarzschild background in an arbitrary gauge .",
    "this is helpful in establishing a range of gauge - invariant results .",
    "in particular , the energy conjugate to time translation symmetry is confirmed to be a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "this is important in order to guarantee that the quantity is a physical observable .",
    "we next establish the behaviour of the wavefunction around the horizon , which is sufficient to establish that the states must decay exponentially with time .",
    "we then turn to a specific choice of gauge that is well - suited to numerical solution .",
    "we solve the equations by simultaneously integrating out from the horizon and in from infinity .",
    "we then vary the energy to ensure that the solutions match at some finite radius .",
    "this process guarantees that we find a global , normalizable bound state .",
    "a set of spectra are obtained , and the density is plotted for a range of states .",
    "decay rates and expectation values for the distance are also presented .",
    "we end with a discussion of the significance of these bound states , and the possible physical processes that they may generate . except where stated otherwise",
    ", natural units with @xmath11 are assumed throughout .",
    "we employ a spacetime metric with signature @xmath12 .",
    "we start by defining a general parameterisation of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "this general form will help to guarantee that various expressions are gauge invariant .",
    "we let @xmath13 denote the standard gamma matrices in the dirac ",
    "pauli representation , and introduce polar coordinates @xmath14 . from these",
    "we define the unit polar matrices @xmath15 in terms of these we define the four matrices @xmath16 where @xmath17 are scalar functions of @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 the reciprocal set of matrices are therefore @xmath20 these matrices satisfy @xmath21 where @xmath22 run over the set @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the identity matrix , and @xmath25 is the spacetime metric .",
    "the line element defined by this metric is @xmath26 this line element is the most general form one can adopt for the schwarzschild solution .",
    "there is only one degree of freedom in equation  , since the terms are related by @xmath27 this arbitrary degree of freedom corresponds to the fact that the time coordinate is only defined up to an arbitrary radially - dependent term .",
    "that is , we can set @xmath28 and the new line element will be independent of the new time coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "rather than think in terms of changing the time coordinate , however , it is simpler for our purposes to always label the time coordinate as @xmath30 and instead redefine @xmath31 and @xmath32 . these then transform as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 unchanged . throughout dashes",
    "denote derivatives with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "it is straightforward to confirm that the new set @xmath36 still satisfy the constraints of equation  .",
    "the four variables @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are subject to two constraint equations , so must contain two arbitrary degrees of freedom .",
    "the first arises from the freedom in the time coordinate as described in equation  .",
    "the second lies in the freedom to perform a radially - dependent boost , which transforms the variables according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an arbitrary , non - singular function of @xmath18 .",
    "this boost does not alter the line element of equation  . outside the horizon",
    "we have @xmath39 , and in the asymptotically flat region @xmath34 can be brought to @xmath40 by a suitable boost .",
    "it follows that we must have @xmath41 at the horizon we therefore have @xmath34 positive , and @xmath42 . for black holes ( as opposed to white holes )",
    "the negative sign is the correct one , as this choice guarantees that all particles fall in across the horizon in a finite proper time .",
    "this sign is also uniquely picked out by models in which the black hole is formed by a collapse process .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath43 combining this with the identity @xmath44 we find that , at the horizon , we must have @xmath45 the diagonal form of the schwarzschild metric sets @xmath46 , so does not satisfy this criteria .",
    "but for this case the time coordinate @xmath30 is only defined outside the horizon , and the horizon itself is not dealt with correctly .",
    "we now have a general parameterisation of the schwarzschild solution in an arbitrary gauge .",
    "the next step is to write down the dirac equation is this background .",
    "this is @xmath47 where @xmath48.\\ ] ] the components of the spin connection are found in the standard way ( see nakahara  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "these turn out to give @xmath49    for the dirac spinor we use a radial separation of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ( complex ) energy and @xmath52 the angular eigenmodes are labeled by @xmath53 , which is a positive or negative nonzero integer , and @xmath54 , which is the total angular momentum in the @xmath55 direction .",
    "our convention for these eigenmodes is that @xmath56 the positive and negative @xmath53 modes are related by @xmath57    the trial function   results in the pair of coupled first - order equations @xmath58 where @xmath59 these are the equations we wish to solve for complex energy @xmath51 .",
    "it is first worthwhile confirming that the equations are gauge invariant .",
    "a redefinition of the time coordinate is equivalent to the transformations described in equation  .",
    "these are combined with the transformation @xmath60 which together ensure that equation   is still satisfied . the radial boost defined by equation",
    "is combined with the transformation @xmath61 to again ensure that the equation is still satisfied . in either case",
    "we see that the eigenvalue @xmath51 is unchanged , so is a true gauge - invariant quantity .",
    "the angular separation of equation   is clearly justified from the form of the dirac equation .",
    "the separation into energy eigenstates is gauge invariant , but it is helpful to see the separation in a gauge where the dirac equation takes on a hamiltonian form .",
    "this is provided by the ` newtonian ' gauge  @xcite which sets @xmath62 in this gauge the dirac equation takes on the simple form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dirac operator in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "this equation is manifestly separable in time , so has solutions which go as @xmath65 .",
    "since the separation works in this gauge , it must work in all others .",
    "we will return to this gauge choice when we turn to finding the energy spectrum .",
    "the nature of equation   can be understood more clearly by writing it in the form @xmath66 this exposes the fact that the horizon is a regular singular point of the radial equations .",
    "the same is true of the origin , and infinity turns out to be an irregular singular point .",
    "this implies that the radial equations can not be manipulated into second - order hypergeometric form , as one is able to do for the hydrogen atom .",
    "the closest the equations come to a recognisable form is that of heun s equation , which generalises the hypergeometric equation to the case of four regular singular points on the complex plane  @xcite .",
    "but heun s equation can usually only be analysed using numerical techniques , and these are the tools we will apply to equation     the presence of singular points means that we must check carefully that our solutions behave appropriately at these points .",
    "the point at infinity is not an issue , as we seek solutions that decay exponentially .",
    "similarly , the origin is not a problem .",
    "we expect that the function will be weakly singular there as the origin acts as a current sink , and this is indeed the case .",
    "the horizon , however , is more complicated .",
    "the wavefunction must be well behaved at the horizon if it is to represent a physical solution . to test this we introduce the series expansion @xmath67 where @xmath68 . on substituting this series into equation  , and setting @xmath69",
    ", we obtain the indicial equation @xmath70_{r=2 m } = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the identity matrix . employing the result",
    "that @xmath71 we find that the two solutions of the indicial equation are @xmath72 equation   then tells us that the two indices are @xmath73 these indices are therefore gauge invariant .",
    "the regular root @xmath74 ensures that we can always construct a solution that is finite and continuous at the horizon .",
    "the singular branch gives rise to discontinuous solutions with an outgoing current at the horizon .",
    "these can be used to provide a heuristic explanation of the hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the non - zero indicial root gives rise to a wavefunction that is ill - defined at the horizon , and so can not represent a physical state .",
    "we must therefore confine our search for bound states to solutions that are regular at the horizon .",
    "the regular and singular solutions are related by a generalized form of time - reversal symmetry . for this",
    "we define @xmath75 which effectively reverses the time direction using the normalized timelike killing vector . in terms of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 functions",
    ", the new solution is characterised by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is determined by @xmath80 the time - reversed solution has energy @xmath81 and so is exponentially growing in time .",
    "the solution is also is singular at the horizon , employing the non - zero root of the indicial equation , and is not normalizable .",
    "eigenmodes with different values of @xmath82 and @xmath54 are orthogonal . for states with the same values of @xmath82 and",
    "@xmath54 the quantum inner product can be taken as @xmath83 where the @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the radial functions in @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "current conservation for the dirac equation is summarised in the relation @xmath88 again it is straightforward to confirm that this equation is gauge invariant .",
    "the right - hand side of this equation defines @xmath89 times the radial flux .",
    "we denote this by @xmath90 , @xmath91 for spatially normalizable states we must have @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",
    "but at the horizon we also have @xmath94 which defines an inward - pointing current . at the horizon",
    ", the regular solution has @xmath95 using the power series expansion of equation  .",
    "the coefficients are related by @xmath96 it is therefore impossible to satisfy @xmath97 for finite energy , so there must be a non - vanishing inward current present at the horizon .",
    "this in turn tells us that the state must decay .",
    "this decay takes place at the origin , where unitary evolution breaks down  @xcite . for bound states",
    "the energy @xmath51 must contain real and imaginary terms , so we set @xmath98 current conservation now takes the form @xmath99    given a set @xmath100 which solve the radial equation   a new solution set is generated by the transformation @xmath101 it follows that the real part of the energy spectrum is symmetric about the zero point .",
    "that is , for a state with real energy @xmath102 a corresponding antiparticle state exists with real energy @xmath103 .",
    "the decay rate is the same for both states , however .",
    "if we assume that the vacuum is constructed from the dirac sea of negative energy states , then this vacuum will decay in time .",
    "a loss of negative energy states can be equally interpreted as generation of positive energy states , which provides a suggestive physical model for hawking radiation .",
    "to solve for the energy spectrum we work mainly in the newtonian gauge of equation  . in this gauge the interaction with the black hole is defined solely by an interaction hamiltonian @xmath104 given by @xmath105 dimensional constants are included in a number of equations in this section to illustrate certain features of the problem . the line element for the newtonian gauge",
    "has flat spatial sections for constant @xmath30 , so the quantum inner product between states has the simple flat - space form @xmath106 the interaction hamiltonian is not hermitian , as we have @xmath107 it is straightforward to check that all wavefunctions approach the origin as @xmath108 , so the non - hermitian part of @xmath104 has finite expectation .",
    "this confirms that hermiticity only breaks down at the origin , as stated earlier . in this respect",
    "it may be more natural to refer to @xmath109 as a ` pseudo - hamiltonian ' , in the sense of an operator acting on an open quantum system  @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that the system described here is open , as the singularity is not treated as part of the quantum system .",
    "but the system is only open in an extremely simple fashion .",
    "there is no ambiguity in either the time evolution of the state , or the correct definition of the observable energy .",
    "time evolution is defined by the dirac equation , in whichever gauge one chooses to adopt , and the energy is defined by the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the fact that we have a hamiltonian description at all is a result of a series of gauge choices , so one must be careful not to place too strong an interpretation on the gauge - dependent quantity @xmath104 .    the bound state energy eigenspectrum is determined entirely by the properties of the wavefunction at the horizon and at infinity .",
    "the demands that the wavefunction is finite at the horizon and falls off exponentially at infinity are sufficient to produce the spectrum .",
    "but it is only by considering the global properties of the wavefunction that the imaginary contribution to the energy is fully understood .",
    "decay only takes place at the singularity , and the decay rate for a given eigenstate is naturally related to the behaviour of the wavefunction near the singularity . if the spatial degrees of freedom in an energy eigenstate are normalized such that @xmath110 then the imaginary component of the energy , @xmath111 , is determined by @xmath112 this identity only holds if the state is globally normalized .",
    "it provides a further independent check that the solutions we obtain numerically are globally normalizable bound states .",
    "the decay rate increases for states with a larger probability density near the singularity , as one would expect .",
    "the fact that the states approach the origin as @xmath108 ensures that the radial probability density tends smoothly to zero at the singularity .",
    "the presence of the singularity does not prevent the formation of normalizable states , and the singular nature of the wavefunction is no worse than that of the ground state of the hydrogen atom .    the interaction hamiltonian is independent of the speed of light , so the non - relativistic approximation to the dirac equation results in the schrdinger equation @xmath113 where the subscript nr denotes non - relativistic .",
    "if we now introduce the phase - transformed variable @xmath114 where @xmath115 we see that @xmath116 satisfies @xmath117 in the non - relativistic limit the energy spectrum is therefore given by the gravitational analogue of the hydrogen atom spectrum  @xcite , @xmath118 in terms of the planck mass @xmath5 we can also write @xmath119 the fact that we have a reasonable starting point for the spectrum in the weak - coupling limit is valuable , as our method involves searching for eigenvalues over the complex energy plane . by analogy with the hydrogen atom case",
    ", we expect that the non - relativistic spectrum will be a reasonable approximation provided @xmath120    returning to the full , relativistic equation  , we convert this to dimensionless form by introducing the dimensionless distance variable @xmath121 which ensures that the horizon lies at @xmath122 .",
    "we also introduce the dimensionless coupling coefficient @xmath123 and energy @xmath124 in terms of these our eigenvalue problem becomes @xmath125 where the dashes now denote derivatives with respect to @xmath126 .",
    "we seek eigenvalues @xmath127 for fixed coupling @xmath9 .",
    "two complementary methods are employed to solve the eigenvalue problem .",
    "we start with a series expansion around the horizon of the regular branch of the solution .",
    "the restriction to this branch removes two degrees of freedom at the horizon , so the function is uniquely specified up to an overall magnitude and phase .",
    "these are chosen conveniently by setting @xmath128 at the horizon .",
    "the power series expansion extends the solution a short distance away from the horizon , from where the values of @xmath129 can be used to initiate numerical integration of the differential equation  . for most values of @xmath127 the numerical integrator will start to increase exponentially after a finite distance .",
    "the aim initially is to vary @xmath127 so as to push this distance out as far as possible . this requires a reasonable initial guess for the eigenvalues , which is where the non - relativistic approximation is helpful to get things started .",
    "once we have achieved a reasonably accurate value for @xmath127 , we turn to a more sophisticated method to improve accuracy .",
    "we seek normalizable states for which @xmath86 is finite over all space . to be confident we have found",
    "such a state we need to numerically integrate inwards from infinity , as well as outwards from the horizon .",
    "if the solutions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be arranged to match at some suitable radius then we have found a global solution to the first - order equations  . to expand about infinity we need to take care of the essential singularity present there .",
    "a suitable series expansion is provided by @xmath130 where @xmath131 the definition of @xmath132 involves a complex square root , and the branch is chosen so that @xmath132 has a positive real value , ensuring the wavefunction falls off exponentially .    the fact that only one root of the indicial equation is used implies that , for a given @xmath127 , @xmath86 is specified at infinity up to an arbitrary magnitude and phase .",
    "the first few terms in the series expansion   are used to compute @xmath86 at a finite radius and these values are then numerically integrated inwards . a certain amount of fine tuning",
    "is then required to pick the radius at which to attempt matching .",
    "once a radius is chosen the matching condition is that the inward and outward values of the two complex functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 agree .",
    "this condition is converted into a set of four scalar equations which state that the real and imaginary differences vanish .",
    "in addition we have four arbitrary parameters to vary  the real and imaginary terms in the energy , and the magnitude and phase of the function integrated inwards from infinity .",
    "this system of four equations and four unknowns is then solved by a newton  raphson method .",
    "this converges very quickly and affords good control over accuracy .",
    "three independent checks were performed on the energy spectrum achieved by this method .",
    "the first was that the calculations were repeated using the same scheme in a different gauge .",
    "the gauge chosen for comparison is defined by advanced eddington ",
    "finkelstein coordinates , with @xmath133 the second test involved using a minimax routine to find the energy spectrum .",
    "this method is less accurate , but gave good agreement for the states of lowest energy .",
    "the final check was to confirm that , after normalization , the states satisfy the identity of equation  .",
    "this check was again satisfied to high precision .",
    "the real parts of the energy for the three lowest - energy states are plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the vertical axis plots the real part of the energy in units of the rest energy of the particle , which is given by @xmath134 the fact that we obtain this dimensionless ratio reflects the equivalence principle .",
    "the mass @xmath2 does not effect the spectrum on its own  the spectrum only depends on the product @xmath135 .",
    "states are labelled using the standard spectroscopic scheme . in this scheme",

    "@xmath82 a ladder of levels is obtained .    .",
    "the horizontal axis labels the dimensionless coupling coefficient @xmath9 , and the lines represent the value of the energy for the coupling at the left of the line , with @xmath9 ranging from @xmath142 to @xmath143 in steps of @xmath144 .",

    "the spectrum resembles that of a hydrogen atom .",
    "but as the coupling increases the energy of the @xmath0 state reaches a minimum and then starts to increase .",
    "the gravitational case avoids the @xmath145 catastrophe of the relativistic coulomb problem .",
    "this is to be expected  coupling strengths with @xmath146 are routinely achieved astrophysically and such objects appear to be stable . we also see that as @xmath9 increases beyond @xmath143 the @xmath139 state appears to take over as the ground state .",

    "with our current choice of gauge the radial form of the wavefunction is best visualised by plotting @xmath89 times the timelike component of the current .",
    "we denote this @xmath181 , so @xmath182 the gauge invariant definition of @xmath181 is that it is @xmath89 times the density as measured by observers in radial free - fall from rest at infinity .",

    "the horizontal axis is the dimensionless radius @xmath126 , and the horizon lies at @xmath122 .",
    "all plots are started from the horizon .",
    "the part of the density inside the horizon is not plotted , though in all cases this smoothly approaches the origin.,height=415 ]    as we increase the coupling to @xmath187 we obtain the series of plots in figure  [ fradp2 ] .",
    "predictably , the wavefunctions start to bunch in closer to the horizon .",
    "slightly more surprisingly , the nodal structure disappears for larger couplings .",
    "the density no longer drops down to near zero at a number of nodes , but instead a number of dips are present .",
    "if we increase the coupling further still , to @xmath188 , the dips themselves are largely washed out and we obtain the somewhat structure - less plots shown in figure  [ fradp3 ] .    , @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 states for a coupling of @xmath187 .",

    "the pattern of nodes and dips seen in figures  [ fradp1 ] and  [ fradp2 ] has almost completely vanished , leaving a series of density profiles that lack structure.,height=415 ]    some additional insight into the nature of the orbitals is obtained by calculating the expectation value of @xmath18 . with our current gauge choices",
    "this is defined in the obvious manner as @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 orbitals are shown in figure  [ fexpr ] .",
    "we see that @xmath192 decreases as the coupling increases . in the low - alpha regime ,",
    "the expectation value follows the radius of the classical circular orbit , so @xmath193 . as the coupling increases , and stable orbits become classically impossible , we find that @xmath192 approaches , and moves within , the horizon .",
    "for higher @xmath6 the bulk of the probability density lies inside the horizon , representing a short - lived state of a tightly - bound particle .     in units of @xmath194 for the @xmath195 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 states .",

    "as @xmath82 increases the orbitals are concentrated further from the source , and begin to resemble hydrogen atom wavefunctions.,height=415 ]    while the low angular momentum orbitals are concentrated near the horizon , the orbitals with larger angular momentum still lie an appreciable distance out . as such",
    ", they adopt a form closer to the familiar hydrogen atom orbitals .",
    "a series of such orbitals are shown in figure  [ fradp4 ] , which shows the first excited mode for @xmath53 values of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the coupling is again set to @xmath197 .",
    "as expected , the probability density is concentrated successively further from the hole . by the time we reach @xmath198",
    "( a classical radius of @xmath199 ) the wavefunction returns to the familiar hydrogen - like form .",
    "so far we have concentrated on the real part of the energy , and the associated orbitals .",
    "but the fact that the black hole effective hamiltonian is not hermitian implies that the energy is not real and the states have a finite half - life .",
    "as such the solutions could be viewed as representing resonance states as opposed to bound states .",
    "but for suitably large angular momenta the half lives can be pushed up as high as desired and the states will be extremely long lived .",
    "such states are appropriate for a quantum description of a particle in a classically stable orbit some distance from the horizon .",
    "as argued above , the imaginary part of the energy will be negative , corresponding to a decay .",
    "the behaviour of this decay can be visualised in a number of ways . with @xmath200 ,",
    "the relevant quantity to study is @xmath201 in figure  [ fei1 ] we plot @xmath202 as a function of coupling for the @xmath0 state . for comparison the real part of the energy",
    "is also plotted .",
    "the real energy falls to a minimum and starts increasing again as the orbits become unfavourably close , whereas the imaginary term simply increases monotonically .",
    "this as one would expect , as figure  [ fexpr ] showed that the orbits become increasingly tightly bound as @xmath9 increases .",
    "as the coupling strength reaches @xmath203 , the imaginary component of the energy is of the order of @xmath204 times the rest energy of the particle .",
    "this implies that the orbit should decay on the time - scale defined by the compton frequency .",
    "these states are therefore extremely short lived , with a resonance width comparable to the orbital energy .",
    "state_. the left hand plot shows ( minus ) the imaginary component of the energy as a function of the coupling strength .",

    "the set of lowest - energy states ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ,  ) is compared to the set of first - excited states ( @xmath183 , @xmath206 ,  ) .",
    "both plots show the expected monotonic increase in @xmath202 with coupling strength as the orbits become more tightly bound and a greater percentage of the wavefunction lies inside the horizon .",
    "the first - excited states are less tightly bound than the ground states , so have smaller decay rates .",
    "below a threshold value of @xmath9 , the imaginary energy is negligible .",
    "this threshold depends roughly linearly on @xmath53 , and is the same for the lowest and first - excited states . using the effective - potential model",
    ", we would expect decay to become dominant beyond the last value of @xmath6 that allows stable circular orbits , @xmath207 .",
    "the plot suggests that this model is reasonably valid .",
    "states with higher angular momentum can therefore be extremely stable , as the increase in @xmath53 keeps the bulk of density away from the singularity .    a classical argument",
    "can also be used to relate the high-@xmath6 behaviour of the imaginary energy to the expectation value of wavefunction radius , by considering the proper time for radial infall .",
    "a massive particle starting at radius @xmath208 from rest would take proper time @xmath209 to reach the singularity .",
    "conversely , the typical decay time for the wavefunction is @xmath210 if the decay time is similar to the infall time from the wavefunction expectation position @xmath211 , we would expect @xmath212 this model works well for the @xmath0 state , and we find @xmath213 in the high-@xmath6 regime .",
    "the model requires some modifications for states with orbital angular momentum , as the infall time takes a more complicated form .    with the decay rates",
    "now obtained , we can return to equation   to check the consistency of our method . for a number of states we computed the normalization integral and also extracted the behaviour of the state near the singularity .",
    "for all of these the imaginary component of the energy was consistent with equation  .",
    "this confirms that the states are normalizable and represent genuine bound states .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of a complicated spectrum of bound states for a quantum fermion in a black hole background . each state represents a spatially - normalizable solution to the dirac equation in a schwarzschild background .",
    "the fact that time - separable solutions exist is simply established in one particular gauge , which casts the equation in a hamiltonian - like form .",
    "a study of the behaviour of the wavefuntion under gauge transformations show that time - separability is a gauge - invariant feature .",
    "the spectrum itself is determined by boundary conditions applied at the horizon and at infinity .",
    "these alone are sufficient to imply the existence of an imaginary ( decay ) contribution to the energy .",
    "the physical explanation for this is provided by the singularity , which acts as a current sink .",
    "the qualitative features of the spectrum can be understood in terms of simple semi - classical models , but a full quantitative understanding only seems possible through a mixture of computational methods .",
    "the work in this paper can clearly be extended in a number of ways .",
    "we have only plotted the spectrum at low coupling strengths of @xmath214 , but astrophysical values can be far larger than this , with @xmath215 for solar mass black holes . for larger @xmath6",
    ", the ground state will be one of high angular momentum . in this regime",
    "the spectrum will be quite different to that of the hydrogen atom .",
    "one important question is precisely how great a binding energy can be achieved . in figure  [ higher_kappa ]",
    "we see that at around @xmath216 we are achieving total energies of @xmath217 , which is significantly lower the classical value of @xmath173 .",
    "this suggests that more energy may be available in accretion processes than is traditionally thought .    as well as increasing @xmath9",
    ", it would be of considerable interest to repeat this work for the case of a kerr black hole . in this respect",
    "a useful start has been made in  @xcite , where the kerr solution is written in a form which generalises the ` newtonian ' gauge employed in this paper .",
    "the calculations for the kerr case are more complicated , however , because the angular separation constants are energy - dependent  @xcite .",
    "there are also signs that the horizon structure of the kerr solution will complicate the fairly straightforward picture presented here .",
    "the problem can be seen by analysing behaviour in a reissner ",
    "nordstrom background using the setup of this paper . for this case",
    "we find that the regular solutions at the outer horizon do not match onto regular solutions at the inner horizon .",
    "so quantum mechanics predicts that the probability density will pile up around the inner horizon in a similar manner to the classical picture .",
    "behaviour of this type is inevitable , as the reissner ",
    "nordstrom singularity does not act as a sink , and the hamiltonian is hermitian .",
    "since the current must still be inward pointing at the outer horizon , the probability density has to pile up somewhere .",
    "it seems likely that a similar picture holds for the kerr solution , but detailed calculations are required to confirm this .",
    "the energy spectra presented in this paper raise a number of fundamental issues , which demonstrate the limitations in our current understanding of the interaction between gravity and quantum theory .",
    "it is unusual to obtain a decay law from quantum mechanics without some form of approximation .",
    "that we do so in the present case is a consequence of the fact that the system is open .",
    "states are allowed to decay onto the singularity , but no accompanying emission is considered . a complete treatment of the problem as a closed system would require a quantum theory of the singularity , and such a theory does not yet exist .",
    "the decay rates represent one feature of the quantum - mechanical description of the capture process .",
    "but , as well as decay , the quantum description of a particle falling onto the singularity of a black hole can involve a series of quantum jumps to lower energy orbits .",
    "this quantum description alters the physics of the process quite dramatically from the classical picture .",
    "as the particle undergoes a series of transitions we expect that it should radiate , which does not happen classically .",
    "quite what form this radiation should take ( electromagnetic , gravity waves ? )",
    "is unclear .",
    "also , as a transition takes place we should keep careful track of the evolution of the matter stress - energy tensor to tell us where the radiated energy is concentrated .",
    "a related problem this exposes is that we have not considered back reaction on the gravitational field , which could alter this picture .",
    "the quantum treatment of a particle in a gravitational field exhibits a curious anti - parallelism with the electromagnetic case .",
    "in classical electrodynamics a charged particle in orbit around a point source should radiate , making atoms unstable .",
    "this problem is resolved by quantum mechanics , which predicts the existence of stable , non - radiating bound states .",
    "the reverse is true of gravitation .",
    "classically , a particle can orbit a black hole in a geodesic outside the horizon , and such an orbit is stable .",
    "but quantum theory changes this , and states that no totally stable orbits exist , due to the finite probability of the particle finding itself inside the horizon and ending on the singularity . while the time - scales involved in these decays may be of limited interest astrophysically ,",
    "such processes are clearly of fundamental importance in understanding the interplay between quantum theory and gravitation .    a final point to raise here",
    "is that the spectrum of real energies derived here has a mirror image of negative energy bound states .",
    "each of these negative energy states also has a finite lifetime .",
    "if we model the vacuum in terms of a dirac sea of filled negative energy states , we must include the bound states as well as the free continuum .",
    "it then follows that the vacuum itself is decaying  the black hole is sucking in the vacuum .",
    "such a loss of negative energy states is seen as a creation of positive energy modes , which could contribute to hawking radiation .",
    "this contribution appears to have been neglected in previous calculations , which concentrate only on the scattered states  @xcite .",
    "it is well known in calculations of the lamb shift , for example , that ignoring the bound states in the calculation gives the wrong answer  @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to assess the contribution played by bound states to the gravitational analogue of this process .",
