    "as one the simplest qcd bound states and as the goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking , the pion is a very intersting theoretical object : its structure carries important implications for the qcd confinement mechanism and the realization of symmetries like isospin in nature .",
    "it is also of practical importance for the hadronic input to the photon structure at low scales .",
    "the latter is connected via vector meson dominance to the @xmath2 meson structure , which is poorly known and thus often replaced by the pion structure .",
    "unfortunately , determinations of the pion structure have made little progress over the last decade .",
    "they are based on old drell - yan and prompt photon data at fixed target energies and large values of the partonic momentum fraction @xmath0 .",
    "many details are still based on pure theoretical assumptions . in order to improve the situation ,",
    "it has been proposed to measure the ( virtual ) pion structure at low @xmath0 in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and photoproduction with leading neutrons at hera @xcite .",
    "since the pion is by far the lightest hadron , its exchange dominates the @xmath3 transition and it will almost be on its mass shell , particularly at small values of the squared momentum transfer @xmath4 between the proton and the neutron .",
    "recently the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera have installed forward proton and neutron calorimeters and presented first results on the semi - inclusive dis structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite and on dijet photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the latter has recently been compared to a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] of this paper , we define the dijet photoproduction cross section , the kinematic variables , and the experimental conditions of the scattering process . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss the pion flux and in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] the pion structure .",
    "the main results are contained in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , where we compare our nlo dijet calculation with the zeus data .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",

    "the production of two jets with a leading neutron at hera is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "the corresponding cross section = _ a , b x_a f_a / e(x_a , m_^2 ) x_b f_b / p(x_b , m_^2 ) depends on the partonic cross section @xmath7 and on the parton densities in the electron and proton f_a / e(x_a , m_^2 ) & = & _ x_a^1f_a/ ( x_,m_^2)f_/e(y , q^2 ) , + f_b / p(x_b , m_^2 ) & = & _ x_b^1f_b/ ( x_,m_^2)f_/p(1-x_n , t ) .",
    "both are convolutions of flux factors and parton densities . the photon flux @xmath8 is given by the usual weizscker - williams approximation @xcite .",
    "the ranges of the photon momentum fraction @xmath9 $ ] and virtuality @xmath10 are dictated by the zeus experiment .",
    "the momentum fraction of the leading neutron @xmath11 and the momentum transfer @xmath4 in the pion flux factor @xmath12 are restricted to @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the hard jets are defined with the @xmath16 cluster algorithm and a maximal distance @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "they are required to have transverse energies above @xmath18 and lie in the central rapidity range @xmath19 .",
    "in principle , a variety of soft reactions can lead to a leading neutron final state at hera .",
    "four different possibilities are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ope ] : a ) charged pion exchange , b ) intermediate @xmath20 production , c ) reggeon ( @xmath21 ) exchange , and d ) pomeron exchange . since the momentum transfer is restricted to low values @xmath22 in the zeus experiment , the pion as the lightest particle in the @xmath4-channel dominates .",
    "diagrams , where an additional pion is produced in the proton fragmentation region ( diagrams b ) and d ) ) , are experimentally excluded .",
    "reggeon exchange amounts to a small ( @xmath23 ) cross section increase .    in the meson cloud model",
    ", the photon - proton collision can be viewed as a process , where a pionic cloud is stripped off a neutron core ( see fig.[fig : glaureac ] ) .    as",
    "the impact parameter @xmath24 becomes small , additional effects like photon absorption or neutron - rescattering may become important .",
    "the semi - inclusive zeus data show that absorption effects decrease the cross section by at most @xmath25 in the @xmath11 range considered , which cancels approximately the increase of the cross section by reggeon exchange .",
    "the light cone representation of the proton wave function is given by    @xmath26 is the bare proton wave function , given by a three - quark state , and @xmath27 is the probability amplitude of finding a baryon b ( = p , n ) with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath28 and transverse momentum @xmath29 and a meson m ( = @xmath30 ) in the proton .",
    "@xmath31 is the wave function renormalization constant and is fixed by the normalization condition @xmath32 .",
    "the splitting function or flux factor takes the general form f_/p(1-x_n , t)&= & ^2*p_t*|_/p(x_n,*p_t*)|^2 ( t-f(p_t ) ) + & = & ( 1-x_n)^1 - 2_(t-m_^2 ) [ f(x_n , t)]^2 .",
    "it can be calculated in covariant or time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath33 is the squared clebsch - gordon isospin coefficient ( 2/3 for leading neutrons , 1/3 for leading protons ) , @xmath34 is the squared pion propagator , and @xmath35 accounts for the virtuality and possible reggeization of the pion .",
    "the interaction term in the pion - nucleon lagrangean leads to the numerator @xmath36 , and off - mass shell effects of the higher @xmath37 and @xmath38 fock states are modeled by a form factor f(x_n , t ) = \\ {    l +    .",
    "the flux factor is constrained by a symmetry relation ( @xmath39 ) and charge and momentum sum rules .",
    "since the momentum transfer @xmath4 is small , we neglect reggeization ( @xmath40 ) and choose a light cone form factor with @xmath41 in good agreement with recent determinations @xcite .",
    "the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath42 is taken from a recent extraction from the goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rule @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the valence quark densities in the pion have been determined in the drell - yan process , while the gluon density has been constrained in prompt photon production ( see tab .  1 ) .",
    ".parameterizations of the parton densities in the pion .",
    "they are constrained by drell - yan ( dy ) and prompt photon production ( @xmath43 ) data and by the momentum sum rule ( msr ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,<,<,^ , < \" , ]     in both cases the relevant data sets were taken in fixed target collisions in the 1980s and are restricted to large @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , they suffer from nuclear effects and fragmentation contributions , respectively , and also from scale uncertainties .",
    "the situation is worst for the sea quarks where theoretical assumptions vary most widely .",
    "it is known that at @xmath45 valence quarks carry about half of the pion s momentum . at the same scale gluons",
    "carry about half of a proton s momentum .",
    "if pions and protons had a similar structure , as assumed by grsc @xcite , no room would be left for the sea quarks .",
    "indeed grv assumed a zero - input density for sea quarks , however at a very low scale @xcite .",
    "smrs determined that sea quarks should however carry between 10 and 20 % of the pion s momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seagluon ] ) @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : piqgy ] we compare the available parton densities in the pion at a scale @xmath46 relevant for dijet photoproduction on a slightly virtual pion .",
    "as one can see , the smrs sea quarks and gluons turn out lower than the very similar abfkw , grv , and grsc distributions @xcite .",
    "the zeus collaboration have compared their dijet results with a leading neutron with lo monte carlo predictions and found reasonable agreement .",
    "it is , however , well - known that pure lo results are strongly scale dependent , that they can be modified by potentially large nlo corrections , and that they do not allow for the implementation of a jet algorithm . for inclusive dijet photoproduction , four different nlo calculations have been performed using different phase space slicing methods and the subtraction method .",
    "they all agree well within numerical errors @xcite .",
    "we have implemented in our calculation @xcite two additional integrations , _",
    "i.e. _ over @xmath11 and @xmath4 , and the pion flux factor .",
    "the proton parton densities have been replaced with those in the pion .    selecting the two jets with highest @xmath47 and integrating over the @xmath48 $ ]",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] the lo and nlo @xmath47 distribution with gs96 photon densities @xcite and two different pion densities to the zeus data .",
    "almost identical results are obtained with grv photon densities .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath49-factor turns out to be one , but the scale dependence is reduced considerably from lo to nlo .",
    "the normalization is sensitive to the chosen pion flux factor : if one includes the regge trajectory ( @xmath50 ) and omits the exponential , the cross section is reduced by @xmath51 .",
    "the same reduction is obtained with a light cone form factor and @xmath52 . resolved photons and gluons in the pion",
    "are important at low @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .    in the ratio of leading neutron and inclusive dijet cross sections in fig.[fig:1b ] , many uncertainties from the scale choice , photon densities , and hadronic energy scale cancel .",
    "the @xmath47 shape is then sensitive to the pion densities and shows a preference for smrs3 over grsc .",
    "if the leading neutron cross section is integrated over the two highest jet @xmath55 , but not over @xmath56 , one obtains the rapidity distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] .",
    "direct photons and quarks in the photon are important at @xmath57 . in this region of jet photoproduction ,",
    "the low quarks in the nlo gs96 parameterization usually give the best fit , despite the fact that they do not reproduce the photon structure function .",
    "@xcite indeed gs96 also gives the best fit for dijets with a leading neutron . at @xmath57 hadronization corrections become also important and can amount to a factor of two .    the data for the ratio of leading neutron over inclusive rapidity distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig:2b ] have still rather large statistical error bars and do not distinguish between different pion parameterizations .    the distribution in the observed momentum fraction of the partons in the pion x_^obs = is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it suffers from the fact that zeus have applied equal @xmath47 cuts on both hard jets , which is known to be infrared sensitive @xcite .",
    "therefore the cut on the second jet in the nlo calculation has to be relaxed to @xmath58 or 5.5 gev .",
    "the best fit is again obtained with gs96 photon densities and smrs3 pion densities , which have the lowest quark and gluon distributions , respectively .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the quark densities in the photon are correlated with the gluon density in the pion . in the @xmath0-distribution",
    ", hadronization corrections may play an important role at small @xmath0 , which is related to negative rapidities .",
    "despite their theoretical and practical importance , the parton densities in the pion are still poorly constrained , particularly below @xmath59 . an intriguing possibility for improvement",
    "consists in dijet photoproduction with a leading neutron at hera , which is dominated by slightly off - shell pion exchange . here",
    "the pion can be probed down to @xmath1 . however , theoretical uncertainties from reggeon exchange and photon absorption , modeled by a pion flux factor , have to be well under control .",
    "data on dijet photoproduction with a leading neutron have been obtained by the zeus collaboration .",
    "unfortunately , zeus have applied theoretically unsafe @xmath47 cuts .",
    "furthermore , the data suffer from large hadronization corrections in the backward region . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard scattering cross section has been calculated in nlo and is theoretically stable .",
    "a comparison of the nlo calculation with data indicates that lower gluon densities in the pion , as predicted by the smrs3 parameterization , are preferred over steeper gluons as predicted by abfkw , grv , or grsc .",
