    "supermassive black holes in the nuclei of many nearby bulges are fundamental constituents of their parent galaxies .",
    "the observed correlations between black hole mass and large scale bulge properties ( marconi & hunt 2003 , and references therein ) suggest there must have been an epoch in which the central black hole had a direct impact on the galaxy s structure .",
    "recent sustained theoretical efforts have indeed identified the period of most rapid black hole growth as the most likely epoch when such an impact was more dramatically felt .",
    "as it is now well established that most of this growth is to be identified with episodes of accretion , when galactic nuclei become `` active '' ( yu and tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) , agn feedback is regarded as a necessary ingredient in all models of galaxy formation and evolution .    in particular , numerical simulations of merging galaxies with smbh growth and radiative feedback ( di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ) demonstrated the effectiveness of quasars in quenching subsequent episodes of star formation .",
    "however , semi - analytic schemes of galaxy formation ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al . 2006 ) as well as indirect evidence of agn - induced heating in clusters of galaxies , both seem to indicate that a different mode of accretion onto smbh , not directly linked to bright quasar phases ( and therefore termed `` radio mode '' ) must be effective in the most massive system at late times in order not to over - predict the observed abundances of high mass galaxies as well as to explain the absence of vigorous cooling flows in the center of clusters .",
    "a mode of agn feedback dominated by kinetic energy is in fact expected on theoretical grounds ( rees et al .",
    "1982 ) in black holes of low luminosity ( in units of the eddington one @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ) .",
    "observational evidence for such `` jet dominated '' modes of accretion come from either black holes of stellar mass in the so - called low / hard or quiescent states ( fender , gallo & jonker 2003 ; gallo et al .",
    "2006 ) and low - luminosity agn ( merloni , heinz and di matteo 2003 [ mhd03 ] ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the observed correlations between the ( unresolved ) radio luminosity of the jet core and its x - ray luminosity can be interpreted as a by - product of the coupling between a radiatively inefficient accretion flow and a self - absorbed ( quasi - conical ) jet , provided that the kinetic luminosity of the jet obeys @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the accretion rate at the outer boundary of the accretion flow , roughly coincident with the bondi radius in the case of agn .",
    "the constant of proportionality in the above relationship can not be directly inferred from the observed radio - x - ray correlations , but has to be determined by direct measurements of jet kinetic energy . on the basis of a very sparse collection of measurements of this sort ,",
    "heinz and grimm ( 2005 ) originally proposed the following scaling : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radio luminosity of the core at 5 ghz measured in ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that such a normalization corresponds to an extreme case in which essentially all accretion power @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , is released as kinetic energy , on the basis of the observed `` fundamental plane '' relation of mhd03 .",
    "one way to test the above relation is to look for alternative , indirect ways to estimate the kinetic power of the agn jet .",
    "this has been done recently by allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) by measuring @xmath9 work done by the jets on the intracluster gas . in figure  [ fig : power ] we show these observational data points , together with a few estimates of kinetic power from direct modeling of the radio lobe emission ( stars ) plotted as a function of the radio core luminosity , either measured directly or , preferentially , from the black hole mass and 2 - 10 kev nuclear luminosity and the mhd03 relation ( see heinz & grimm 2005 for references ) . in the same figure we also plot relation ( [ eq : scal ] ) . indeed",
    ", the observational points do not scatter too far away from the predicted relation , even more so if one considers that the kinetic power measurements from x - ray cavities ( circles and squares ) , although averages , are most likely lower limit to the intrinsic jet power , due to the additional presence of weak shocks and low - contrast cavities ( nulsen et al . 2006 ) .",
    "with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scal ] ) , we are now in the position to attempt a measurement of the kinetic luminosity function of agn .",
    "first , we need to derive the intrinsic 5ghz jet core luminosity function of agn .",
    "this can be done by analytically de - beaming the observed luminosity function of flat spectrum radio quasars and blazars ( dominated by relativistically beamed sources ) , via the formalism described in detail in urry and padovani ( 1991 ) .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified if a narrow distribution of lorentz factor is assumed for the jets , and , for the sake of simplicity , we assume this holds true here",
    ".    one can then use the technique developed in merloni ( 2004 ) to unveil the accretion history of smbh based on the combined evolution of the hard x - ray and radio cores luminosity function coupled with the fundamental plane relationship . here , differently from merloni ( 2004 ) , we adopt an intrinsic radio core luminosity function evolution , based on the observed fsrq / blazar luminosity function of de zotti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , to which we added local constraints on the faint - end slope from filho , barthel & ho ( 2006 ) .",
    "we adopt the scaling ( [ eq : scal ] ) for all sources accreting below a critical eddington fraction , that we have fixed at about 3% ( see merloni 2004 ) .",
    "such objects , by construction , will lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity and represent the majority of radio sources below the fri / frii divide .",
    "we assume here that only a small fraction of the accreting matter ( powering the jet ) makes its way onto the central black holes , i.e. we assume that black holes are always radiatively efficient _ with respect to the accreted gas _ , rather than to the liberated energy ( see the discussion in gallo et al .",
    "2006 ) . for object",
    "whose accretion rate is above 3% , we assume that the vast majority ( 90% ) are radio quiet and radiatively efficient ( with @xmath10 ) , while for the remaining 10% the liberated energy is equally divided into radiative and kinetic .",
    "those powerful radio loud quasar dominate the high end of the radio luminosity function ( fr ii ) .",
    "given such a recipe for the accretion modes ( or , equivalently , for the radiative and kinetic efficiencies as functions of @xmath0 ) , the local smbh mass function can be evolved backwards in time according to the corresponding accretion rate distribution , and the procedure is reiterated until acceptable fits to the observed hard x - ray and radio core luminosity functions are found .    figure  [ fig : bhar ] shows , on the left panel , the evolution of the computed kinetic luminosity function of agn at four different redshifts . by integrating these luminosity functions",
    "one can obtain the redshift evolution of the kinetic energy density , @xmath11 , provided by smbh .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bhar ] . here",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath11 include not only the jets lorentz factor distribution , but also uncertainties on the faint end slope of the radio core luminosity function .",
    "the redshift evolution of @xmath11 differs substantially from that of the accretion rate ( bhar ) density , strongly resembling instead the required `` radio mode '' evolution of galaxy formation models ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al .",
    "a more detailed study of these results is underway and will be presented elsewhere ( heinz et al .",
    ", merloni et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "a separate mode of smbh growth in which most of the energy is released in kinetic form is postulated both on theoretical grounds and from very general arguments of galaxy formation theory .",
    "here we have discussed how direct observational evidence of such a mode emerging from recent studies of x - ray binary black holes can be generalized to the case of smbh , when the accretion rate ( in eddington units ) is low ( less than a few percent ) .",
    "we have then presented a scaling that provides a simple method to estimate the kinetic energy output of black holes growing at sub - eddington rates .",
    "using such a scaling , we have derived the kinetic luminosity function of agn and its redshift evolution .",
    "overall , we show conclusively that the kinetic power output of the low-@xmath0 mode of smbh growth has a very different redshift dependency from the radiative one , and matches the phenomenological requirements put forward by semi - analytic schemes of galaxy formation : it is in fact more effective at late times ( and for the more massive systems ) .",
    "our results suggest that the so - called `` radio mode '' of agn feedback is simply a jet - dominated _ accretion mode _ , and that its physical and evolutionary properties are dictated by the physics of accretion in the vicinity of the smbh ."
