    "in black - hole and neutron - star x - ray binaries quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are occasionally observed with frequencies close to the relativistic keplerian frequencies of the innermost region of disks surrounding the central sources ( e.g. , van der klis 2000 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "one of possible origins of these quasi - periodic oscillations is disk oscillations in the innermost region of the disks ( discoseismology ) .",
    "the innermost regions of relativistic disks are subject to strong gravitational field of central sources , and thus behaviors of disk oscillations in these relativistic regions are different from those in newtonian disks ( see , e.g. , kato and fukue 1980 ) .",
    "one of the differences is related to the difference of radial distribution of ( radial ) epicyclic frequency @xmath0 . in relativistic disks",
    "the epicyclic frequency does not monotonically increase inwards , but has a maximum , @xmath1 , at a certain radius , say @xmath2 , and inside the radius it decreases inward to vanish at the radius of isco ( innermost stable circular orbit ) .",
    "this radius is roughly the inner edge of the disks .",
    "the g - mode oscillations are oscillation modes whose frequencies , say @xmath3 , are lower than @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "okazaki et al .",
    "( 1987 ) showed that in relativistic disks the propagation region of the oscillations is bounded by the two radii where @xmath5 is realized .",
    "at these two radii the oscillations are reflected .",
    "this is the self - trapping of the g - mode oscillations in relativistic disks .",
    "eigen - frequencies of these trapped g - mode oscillations in geometrically thin disks are calculated in detail by perez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using the kerr geometry .",
    "nowak et al . ( 1997 ) suggested that these trapped oscillations might be the origin of the 67 hz oscillations observed in the black - hole source grs 1915 + 105 .    in the above studies , however , effects of magnetic fields on oscillations were outside considerations .",
    "fu and lai ( 2009 ) examined these effects and found important results .",
    "that is , they showed that the g - mode oscillations are strongly affected if poloidal magnetic fields are present in disks and the self - trapping of g - mode oscillations is destroyed even when the fields are weak .",
    "for example , they showed that @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) is enough to destroy the self - trapping in the case of axisymmetric g - mode oscillations , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are alfvn and acoustic speeds in disks , respectively .",
    "their results are very interesting in considering what kinds of disk oscillations are possible candidates of quasi - periodic oscillations , but their analyses are rough and more careful examinations are necessary to evaluate a quantitative condition of destruction of the self - trapping of g - mode oscillations . for example , they do not take into account quantitatively the effects of vertical structure of disks . in geometrically thin disks",
    ", the disk density decreases apart from the equatorial plane , while the alfvn speed increases greatly in the vertical direction , if the strength of poloidal magnetic fields is nearly constant in disks .",
    "these sharp decrease of density and sharp increase of alfvn speed in the vertical direction should be carefully taken into account in examination of wave motions .    to avoid mathematical complication and difficulty related to the above situations , it is worthwhile to consider disks with finite vertical thickness .",
    "this is , however , not only for avoidance of mathematical complication .",
    "consideration of such disks is important from the observational and physical viewpoints .",
    "many black - hole and neutron - star x - ray binaries show both soft and hard components of spectra , and record a soft - hard transition .",
    "usually three states are known : high / soft state , very high / intermediate state ( steep power - law state ) , and the low / hard state .",
    "remillard ( 2005 ) shows that detection of high frequency qpos in black - hole x - ray binaries is correlated with power - law luminosity , and their frequencies are related to soft components .",
    "this suggests that at the state where high frequency qpos are observed , the sources have both geometrically thin disks and coronae .    in this context , by using the above - mentioned disk geometry ( geometrically thin cool disk and a hot corona surrounding the disk ) , we examine in this paper the effects of vertical magnetic fields on g - mode oscillations by a perturbation method .",
    "the results show that the perturbation method is applicable till a critical strength of magnetic fields which depends on disk thickness . in the case where disk thickness is three times the vertical half - thickness , @xmath10 , of disks , for example",
    ", the critical strength of magnetic fields where the perturbation method is applicable is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath9 are alfvn speed on the disk equator and acoustic speed , respectively .",
    "our results show that till these critical magnetic fields where the perturbation method is applicable , axisymmetric g - mode oscillations are still self - trapped .",
    "this result is different from that obtained by use of a rough local approximation for vertically extended disks by fu and lai ( 2009 ) .",
    "we are interested in g - mode oscillations in relativistic disks . the general relativistic treatments of dynamical equations are , however , very complicated . hence ,",
    "following a conventional way , we treat newtonian equations , but adopt the general relativistic expression for ( radial ) epicyclic frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we consider vertically isothermal , geometrically thin disks .",
    "the disks are assumed to be subject to vertical magnetic fields .",
    "we adopt the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) whose origin is at the center of a central object and the @xmath15-axis is perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "then , the magnetic fields in the unperturbed state , @xmath16 , are @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{unifom - fields}\\ ] ] since the magnetic fields are purely vertical , they have no effects on the vertical structure of disks , and the hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction in disks gives the disk density , @xmath18 , stratified in the vertical direction as ( e.g. , see kato et al .",
    "2008 ) @xmath19 where the scale height , @xmath20 , is related to the isothermal acoustic speed , @xmath21 , and vertical epicyclic frequency , @xmath22 , by @xmath23 in relativistic disks under the schwarzschild metric , @xmath24 is equal to the relativistic kepler frequency .",
    "the above - mentioned vertically isothermal disks can extend infinitely in the vertical direction , although they are derived under the assumption that the disks are thin in the vertical direction . here",
    ", we assume that the disks are terminated at a finite height , say @xmath25 , by presence of hot corona . the height @xmath25 is taken to be a parameter . as a dimensionless parameter we adopt @xmath26 hereafter .",
    "we consider small - amplitude adiabatic perturbations in the above - mentioned vertically isothermal disks .",
    "the perturbations are assumed to be isothermal in the vertical direction .    since the magnetic fields , @xmath16 are perturbed to @xmath27 , we have @xmath28.\\ ] ] hence , the time variations of eulerian velocity perturbations over the rotation , ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , are expressed by use of the @xmath13- , @xmath14- and @xmath15-components of equation of motion , respectively , as @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath0 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath35 is the angular velocity of disk rotation , @xmath36 is @xmath37 and @xmath8 is the alfvn speed defined by @xmath38 @xmath12 being the alfvn speed on the equator .",
    "the time variation of magnetic fields is governed by the induction equation , which is @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 finally , the time variation of density is governed by the equation of continuity , which is @xmath42    hereafter , we concentrate our attention only on axisymmetric oscillations , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "this is because we are interested in g - mode oscillations in this paper , and asymmetric g - mode oscillations are damped by corotation resonance ( kato 2003 , li et al .",
    "in addition , the radial variations of unperturbed quantities , such as @xmath35 , @xmath44 , @xmath20 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are neglected , assuming that the radial wavelengths of perturbations are shorter than the characteristic radial lengths of unperturbed quantities ( local approximations in the radial direction ) .",
    "the radial variation of @xmath0 is , however , carefully taken into account , because its radial variation is sharp near to the disk edge .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 is written as @xmath48 , since we are interested in normal mode oscillations whose frequency is @xmath3 .",
    "then , combining equations ( [ ur0 ] ) and ( [ uvarphi ] ) we have @xmath49 . \\label{h1ur2}\\ ] ] the righthand side of this equation shows how the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath29 is affected by magnetic fields .",
    "there is another relation between @xmath29 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is obtained from equations ( [ uz ] ) and ( [ continuity ] ) by eliminating @xmath31 , which is @xmath50    if @xmath29 is eliminated from the lefthand side of equation ( [ h1ur ] ) by using equation ( [ h1ur2 ] ) , we have @xmath51 , \\label{eqh1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vertical coordinate @xmath15 has been changed to dimensionless coordinate @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 . by using the induction equations we can write the righthand side of equation ( [ eqh1 ] ) in terms of @xmath54 . then , equation ( [ eqh1 ] ) is expressed as @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{eqh1u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of no magnetic fields , the righthand side of equation ( [ eqh1u ] ) vanishes , and we have @xmath56 this is the well - known wave equation in disks in a simplified situation ( e.g. , kato 2001 , kato 2016 ) .",
    "we examine the effects of magnetic fields on the wave motions described by equation ( [ eqh1_0 ] ) by a perturbation method in the next section .",
    "as mentioned before we are interested in disks which are terminated at certain height by presence of hot corona . the disk thickness is assumed to be terminated at @xmath57 ( i.e. , at @xmath58 ) .",
    "the disk thickness , @xmath59 , is a parameter , and we impose a boundary condition at @xmath59",
    ".    it will be relevant to assume that at the deformed boundary surface between disk and corona @xmath60 is continuous=0.\\ ] ] the normal component of this equation shows that @xmath61 must be continuous at the boundary , where the subscript @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote , respectively , the normal and tangential components at the boundary , as is known in the field of hydromagnetic shocks . in deriving this equation continuity of @xmath64 has been used .",
    "the tangential component of the above equation of motion gives that @xmath65 is also continuous at the boundary .",
    "this latter condition is , however , not used here . ] , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the normal component of fluid velocity and the tangential component of magnetic fields . by the definition of the boundary surface we have @xmath68 at the surface .",
    "furthermore , since the unperturbed magnetic fields have no horizontal components , the lagrangian variation of @xmath69 vanishes there , i.e. , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 represents lagrangian variation .",
    "hence , the boundary condition we should adopt is continuation of @xmath72 at the surface . furthermore , we assume that in the corona , pressure perturbations resulting from wave motions in disks are quickly smoothed out by high temperature ( large acoustic speed ) , i.e. , we assume @xmath73 in the corona .",
    "the timescale of the smoothing in corona is shorter than the timescale of oscillations , because the corona temperature will be on the order of virial temperature .",
    "consequently , the boundary condition we adopt is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is displacement vector associated with perturbations . in the case of axially",
    "symmetric perturbations ( @xmath43 ) , equation ( [ boundary ] ) is written as @xmath76    combination of equations ( [ bc2 ] ) and ( [ continuity ] ) leads the boundary condition to @xmath77 this boundary condition is further reduced by using equations ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ uz ] ) in a form expressed in terms of @xmath36 alone , which is @xmath78 our subject is thus to solve equation ( [ eqh1u ] ) with boundary condition ( [ bc4 ] ) .",
    "here , we solve equation ( [ eqh1u ] ) by a perturbation method . that is , we start from the limit of no magnetic fields , and examine the effects of magnetic fields by a perturbation method .      in the limit of no magnetic fields ,",
    "equation ( [ eqh1u ] ) is reduced to equation ( [ eqh1_0 ] ) and this latter equation can be solved easily by a variable separation method .",
    "that is , by separating @xmath79 as @xmath80 and dividing equation ( [ eqh1_0 ] ) by @xmath36 , we can separate equation ( [ eqh1_0 ] ) into @xmath13- and @xmath52- dependent parts .",
    "then , by introducing a separation constant , @xmath81 , we have two equations : @xmath82 and @xmath83 the separation constant , @xmath81 , is determined by the boundary condition ( [ bc4 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqg ] ) has two independent solutions , which are plane - symmetric ( even function of @xmath52 ) and plane - asymmetric ( odd function of @xmath52 ) .",
    "their formal solutions are @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the case where the disk extends infinitely in the vertical direction , i.e. , @xmath86 , equations ( [ geq1 ] ) and ( [ geq2 ] ) show that the series in these equations must be terminated at finite terms .",
    "otherwise , the boundary condition that energy density of perturbations do not diverge at infinity can not be satisfied .",
    "this requires that the separation constant @xmath81 [ which is also eigenvalue of equation ( [ eqg ] ) ] needs to be zero or positive integers , i.e. , the set of @xmath81 s are @xmath87 , where @xmath88 0 , 1 , 2 , .. and @xmath89 , 1 , 2 , ... the eigen - function corresponding to @xmath87 , say @xmath90 , is the hermite polynomial , i.e. , @xmath91 ( okazaki et al .",

    ", we should remember that the fourth order term in equation ( [ separation_f2 ] ) is a term resulting from perturbations .",
    "hence , by substituting the zeroth order solution ( [ zeroth ] ) into the righthand side of equation ( [ separation_f2 ] ) we reduce the fourth order term to a second order term .",
    "then , we reduce equation ( [ separation_f2 ] ) to @xmath177           + \\frac{\\omega^2-k^{(0)}\\omega_\\bot^2}{\\omega_\\bot^2}f                  \\nonumber     \\\\       = -h^2\\frac{d}{dr}\\biggr[a\\frac{c_{{\\rm a}0}^2}{c_{\\rm s}^2 }          \\frac{\\omega_\\bot^2}{\\omega^2-\\kappa^2 }           \\frac{d}{dr}\\biggr(\\frac{\\omega^2-k^{(0)}\\omega_\\bot^2}{\\omega_\\bot^2}f\\biggr )           \\biggr ] . \\label{separation_f22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is the final wave equation describing the axisymmetric g - mode oscillations .    the righthand side of equation ( [ separation_f22 ] ) comes from the perturbation .",
    "thus , comparison of the righthand side of this equation with the first term on the lefthand side roughly shows that equation ( [ separation_f22 ] ) is valid only when @xmath181 that is , we can study trapping of axisymmetric g - mode oscillations by use of equation ( [ separation_f22 ] ) , as long as @xmath182 is small in the sense that inequality ( [ condition - of - a ] ) is satisfied . unless we consider very low - frequency oscillations , the above condition is roughly @xmath165 .",
    "the values of @xmath182 required for @xmath165 are shown in table 1 for disks with some finite disk thickness ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) .",
    "it is noted that the present perturbation method can not be applied when @xmath86 ( see table 1 ) , since in this case , @xmath183 and condition ( [ condition - of - a ] ) requires @xmath180 .",
    "starting from equation ( [ separation_f22 ] ) , we examine the propagation region of g - mode oscillations . in equation ( [ separation_f22 ] ) there is an apparent singularity at the radius of @xmath184 . to avoid this inconvenience",
    "we introduce a new dependent function @xmath185 defined by @xmath186 this function @xmath185 is related to @xmath29 [ see equation ( [ fu - f ] ) ] .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , the radial variation of @xmath187 in the wave propagation region is neglected . the term with @xmath160 in equation ( [ separation_f22 ] )",
    "is also neglected , because it is a small term .",
    "then , from equation ( [ separation_f22 ] ) we have @xmath188 taking the radial derivative of this equation , we have approximately @xmath189    this equation tends to the wave equation describing oscillations in disks with no magnetic fields in the limit of @xmath180 .",
    "this equation clearly shows that the wave propagation region is specified by @xmath190 , when condition ( [ condition - of - a ] ) is satisfied . in the case of g - mode oscillations we have @xmath191 , and",
    "thus their propagation region is @xmath192 . in relativistic disks , the propagation region of g - mode oscillations with @xmath193",
    "is bounded by two radii where @xmath184 is realized , where @xmath1 is the maximum value of epicyclic frequency .",
    "furthermore , at the radii where @xmath184 is realized the wavenumber of oscillations vanishes : waves approached there are reflected back .",
    "that is , g - mode oscillations are trapped by cavity due to radial distribution of epicyclic frequency .",
    "the above results show that the characteristics concerning the wave trapping region of g - mode oscillations in the case of no magnetic fields remains unchanged even in magnetized disks , as long as condition ( [ condition - of - a ] ) holds",
    ".    it will be instructive to show that the trapping is also derived from equation ( [ separation_f2 ] ) by taking @xmath194 .",
    "that is , by taking @xmath194 under the local approximation and other approximations adopted above , we have formally from equation ( [ separation_f2 ] ) : @xmath195    this equation needs to be solved by regarding the last term as a perturbation term .",
    "that is , @xmath196 is written as @xmath197 .",
    "then , we have @xmath198 and @xmath199 from the above two equations , we have @xmath200.\\ ] ] this expression for @xmath196 is the same as that obtained from equation ( [ tilde_f3 ] ) by taking @xmath201 , when condition ( [ condition - of - a ] ) holdes .",
    "in non - magnetized relativistic disks , g - mode oscillations are self - trapped in the innermost region of the disks ( okazaki et al .",
    "this self - trapping of oscillations is of importance , because such discrete oscillations in infinitely extended disks might be one of possible causes of high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations observed in black - hole and neutron - star x - ray binaries . among g - mode oscillations ,",
    "however , non - axisymmetric ones are outside of our interest , because these oscillations have a corotation point in their propagation region except for special cases and are strongly damped by the corotation resonance ( kato 2003 , li et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "fu and lai ( 2009 ) , however , suggested that all g - mode oscillations are strongly affected by the presence of poloidal magnetic fields and their self - trapping is easily destroyed even if the fields are weak .",
    "their results are of interest , but are based on a rough examination of wave motions in disks which extend infinitely ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) in the vertical direction .",
    "wave motions in vertically thick disks with vertical magnetic fields have complicated vertical behaviors .",
    "the complications come from the fact that the kinetic energy density of waves , for example @xmath202 , and that of magnetic energy density , for example @xmath203 , have quite different @xmath15-dependences .",
    "this complication is related to the fact that the acoustic speed , @xmath9 , is assumed to have no @xmath15-dependence , while the alfvn speed , @xmath8 , increases with @xmath15 and becomes infinite if the disk extends infinity in the vertical direction .    to avoid the above complication , it is helpful to consider disks with finite vertical thickness .",
    "consideration of such disks is , however , not temporizing .",
    "this is important and necessary .",
    "observations suggest that quasi - periodic oscillations occur in a disk - corona system where disks are truncated at a certain height and sandwiched by hot coronae ( remillard 2005 ) .",
    "hence , we have considered in this paper the disks which are truncated at a certain height by a hot corona .",
    "the results of our analyses show that as long as dimensionless parameter , @xmath204 , is smaller than unity ( more rigorously , as long as the condition ( [ condition - of - a ] ) is satisfied ) , axisymmetric g - mode oscillations are trapped in the cavity of epicyclic frequency .",
    "the magnetic fields required for @xmath165 is small , but will not be too small compared with those in realistic objects .",
    "it should be noted that as vertical thickness of disks decreases , the critical value of @xmath182 for which our perturbation method is applicable increases ( see table 1 ) . in the limit of no termination of disk thickness ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) ,",
    "however , our perturbation method is not applicable , i.e. , the required value of @xmath182 tends to zero .",
    "that is , in vertically extended disks characteristics of trapping of g - mode oscillations are strongly affected even if the magnetic fields are weak .",
    "our analyses can not say how the trapping is affected in such disks with strong vertical magnetic fields .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations are not always observed in every black - hole and neutron - star sources , and also their frequencies are not always robust except for those in some black - hole sources .",
    "high frequency qpos may not be a homogeneous class .",
    "hence , trapped g - mode oscillations will still remain as one of possible candidates of qpos at least in sources with weak vertical magnetic fields .",
    "an issue to be mentioned here is whether axisymmetric g - mode oscillations can be really excited in disks , since they will be damped by viscous processes unlike the p - mode oscillations ( see , e.g. , kato 1978 , 2016 ) .",
    "we think that the most promising excitation process of axisymmetric g - mode oscillations is stochastic one by turbulence , although any numerical simulations do not suggest the presence of this possibility in disks yet .",
    "non - radial oscillations in the sun and stars are believed now to be excited by stochastic processes by turbulence ( goldreich and keeley 1977 , see also kato 1966 ) .",
    "similar processes are also naturally expected in disks , since the turbulence in disks are much stronger than in the sun and stars ( see nowak and wagoner 1993 and kato 2016 ) . another possible excitation process of axisymmetric g - mode oscillations is a wave - wave resonant excitation process in deformed disks ( kato 2013 ) . in this case",
    "another oscillation which becomes a set of the g - mode oscillation is excited . a question concerning",
    "this wave - wave resonant excitation is whether a disk deformation required for the resonance process is really expected in disks .",
