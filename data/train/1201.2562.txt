    "the cosmic background radiation , among other phenomena , definitely testifies that the universe had been strongly compressed in the past . but how strongly ? that is the question .",
    "the information from the past , coming to us with electromagnetic waves , tells us only about the phenomena that happened after the universe became transparent .",

    "however , one should keep in mind that the dust matter approximation is applicable if the galaxies are located at far distances from one another .    the macroscopic theory can help understanding some specific features of the universe evolution , but it does not determine the physical nature of what we call `` dark sector '' .",
    "the vector fields can be considered as appropriate tools for macroscopic description of the universe evolution .  from my point of view",

    "the previous analysis confirms that the zero - mass vector field is adequate for the description of dark energy@xcite . in some papers",
    "the dark energy is considered as the origin of acceleration .",
    "however , zero - mass fields can be responsible for contractions and expansions only at a constant rate .",
    "the acceleration is connected with massive vector fields .",
    "being massive , they can not be associated with dark energy . at the same time",
    ", their energy - momentum tensor differs from the one of the ordinary matter .",
    "therefore , the massive fields should correspond to dark matter ( at least , partly ) .    from the general relativity viewpoint , all three kinetic terms in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian sym and antisym ] ) have equal rights .",
    "in flat spacetime the antisymmetric term @xmath326 corresponds to electromagnetic field ( photons ) .",
    "the symmetric term @xmath327 has attention to the gauge vector particles@xcite .",
    "there is no reason why the term @xmath328 should be `` more equal than others '' .",
    "so , the lagrangian ( [ lag case a ] ) also deserves to be associated with some particles , existing in nature . in accordance with the subsection `` regular cosmological solutions '' , the observed@xcite point of minimum @xmath329 where the deceleration turns back to acceleration ( see figures 5,6 ) ,",
    "could correspond to @xmath330 @xmath331 .",
    "it is worth trying to detect an extremely light particle with the rest energy @xmath332 ev .",
    "the trouble is that the massive vector field displays itself via gravitation ( it curves the spacetime ) , but there is no evidence of its direct interaction with the ordinary matter .",
