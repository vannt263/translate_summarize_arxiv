    "the problem of spin transport occupies minds of condensed matter physicists for decades .",
    "a simple example of spin transport is spin diffusion , which is a process accompanied with dissipation .",
    "conceptually more complicated is `` dissipationless '' spin transport , which was also discussed long time but was in the past and remains now to be a matter of controversy .",
    "the main source of controversy is that spin is not a conserved quantity .",
    "this leads to many complications and ambiguities in defining such concepts as spin _ flow , current , or transport_. sometimes these complications are purely semantic .",
    "however , this does not make them simpler for discussion .",
    "`` semantic traps '' very often are a serious obstacle for understanding physics and for deriving proper conclusions concerning observation and practical application of the phenomenon .",
    "the best strategy in these cases is to focus not on names but on concepts hidden under these names . only after this",
    "one may `` take sides '' in semantic disputes not forgetting , however , that choosing names is to considerable extent a matter of convention and taste .    during long history of studying the problem of `` dissipationless '' spin transport",
    "one can notice three periods , when studies in this field were especially intensive .",
    "the first period started from theoretical suggestions on possible `` superfluidity of electron - hole pairs '' @xcite , which were later extended on possible spin superfluidity @xcite .",
    "at the same period the concept of spin superfluidity was exploited @xcite for interpretation of experiments demonstrating unusually fast spin relaxation in @xmath0he - a @xcite .",
    "the second period was marked by intensive theoretical and experimental work on spin superfluidity in @xmath0he - b starting from interpretation of experiments on the so - called homogeneously precessing domain ( hpd ) @xcite in terms of spin supercurrents @xcite .",
    "finally in these days ( the third period ) we observe a growing interest to dissipationless spin currents in connection with work on spintronics @xcite .",
    "the final goal of spintronics is to create devices based on spin manipulation , and transport of spin with minimal losses is crucial for this goal .",
    "now one can find reviews summarizing the investigations done during the first @xcite and the second @xcite periods of works on dissipationless spin transport . on the other hand ,",
    "the work on spin transport in spintronics is a developing story , and probably it is still premature to write summarizing reviews .",
    "nevertheless , some reviews mostly addressing the spin hall effect have already appeared @xcite .",
    "it looks also useful to have a glance on the current status of the field from a broader viewpoint and to find bridges between current investigations and those done in the `` last millennium '' .",
    "the present review aims at this goal .",
    "the intention is to discuss mostly concepts without unnecessary deepening in details , and simplest models were chosen for this .",
    "the term `` superfluidity '' is used in the literature to cover a broad range of phenomena , which have been observed in superfluid @xmath1he and @xmath0he , bose - einstein condensates of cold atoms , and , in the broader sense of this term , in superconductors . in the present review superfluidity means only a possibility to transport a physical quantity ( mass , charge , spin , ... ) without dissipation .",
    "exactly this phenomenon gave a rise to the terms `` superconductivity '' and `` superfluidity '' , discovered nearly 100 years and 70 years ago respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that one should not understand the adjective `` dissipationless '' too literally . in reality",
    "we deal with an essential suppression of dissipation due to the presence of energetic barriers of the topological origin .",
    "how essential suppression could be , is a matter of a special analysis . in the present review",
    "we restrict discussion with the question whether activation barriers , which suppresses dissipation , can appear .",
    "but superfluidity is not the only reason for suppression of dissipation in the transport process , and it is important to understand the difference between various types of dissipationless transport . in the present review",
    "we shall discuss four types of them :    * superfluid transport : the spin - current state is a metastable state ( a local but not the absolute minimum in the parameter space ) . * ballistic transport . here",
    "spin is transported without losses simply because sources of dissipation are very weak . * equilibrium currents .",
    "sometimes symmetry allows currents even at the equilibrium .",
    "a superconductor in a magnetic field is a simple example .",
    "equilibrium spin currents are also possible , though there is a dispute on whether they have something to do with spin transport .",
    "equilibrium spin currents are genuine persistent currents , since no dissipation is possible at the equilibrium by definition . * spin currents in the spin hall effect .",
    "these currents are also called dissipationless since they are normal to the driving force ( electric field ) and therefore do not produce any work .",
    "however , in the spin hall effect there is dissipation connected with a longitudinal charge current through a conducting medium . on the other hand",
    ", it was recently revealed that the spin hall effect is possible also in insulators where a charge current is absent .",
    "then spin currents are not accompanied by any dissipation becoming similar to equilibrium spin currents .",
    "the second type ( ballistic ) looks mostly trivial : dissipation is absent because sources of dissipation are absent .",
    "still it is worth of short discussion since sometimes they confuse ballistic transport with superfluid transport ( an example of it is discussed in section  [ spv ] ) .",
    "the superfluid transport does not require the absence of dissipation mechanisms .",
    "one may expect that in an ideally clean metal at zero temperature resistance would be absent .",
    "but this would not be superconductivity .",
    "superconductivity is the absence of resistance in a dirty metal at @xmath2 .",
    "the first two types of spin currents are discussed in part i of the review , which is devoted to magnetically ordered systems .",
    "the third and the fourth types are discussed mostly in part ii , which addresses time - reversal - invariant systems without magnetic order , though in magnetically ordered media equilibrium spin currents are also possible ( section [ heli ] ) . since from the very beginning of the theory of superfluidity the relation between superfluidity and bose condensation was permanently in the focus of attention , discussing spin superfluidity one can not avoid to consider the concept of magnon bose condensation , which is vividly debated nowadays .",
    "section  [ mbec ] addresses this issue .",
    "* part i : spin currents in magnetically ordered systems *",
    "since the idea of spin superfluidity originated from the analogy with the more common concept of mass superfluidity let us shortly summarize the latter .",
    "the essence of the transition to the superfluid or superconducting state is that below the critical temperature the complex order parameter @xmath3 , which has a meaning of the wave function of the bosons or the fermion cooper pairs , emerges as an additional macroscopical variable of the liquid . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a neutral superfluid at zero temperature putting aside the two - fluid theory for finite temperatures",
    ". then the theory of superfluidity tells that the order parameter @xmath4 determines the particle density @xmath5 and the velocity of the liquid is given by the standard quantum - mechanical expression @xmath6 thus the velocity is a gradient of a scalar , and any flow is potential .",
    "since the phase and the particle number are a pair of canonically conjugate variables , one can write down the hamilton equations for the pair of the canonically conjugated variables `` phase  density '' : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the total liquid energy , whereas @xmath9 is the energy density , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functional derivatives of the total energy : @xmath12 @xmath13 in these expressions @xmath14 is the chemical potential , @xmath15 is the particle current , and the dependence of the energy on the density gradient was ignored .",
    "eventually the hamilton equations are reduced to the equations of hydrodynamics for an ideal liquid : @xmath16 @xmath17    a crucial property of the system is the gauge invariance : the energy does not depend on the phase directly ( @xmath18 ) but only on its gradient . according to noether s theorem this must lead to the conservation law for a conjugate variable , the total number of particles . the conservation law manifests itself in the continuity equation ( [ idliq ] ) , which contains the particle supercurrent .",
    "the prefix `` super '' stresses that this current is not connected with dissipation .",
    "it is derived from the hamiltonian or the lagrangian but not from the dissipation function .",
    "in contrast to the diffusion current proportional to the density gradient , the supercurrent is proportional to the phase gradient .",
    "therefore it appears only in a coherent state with broken gauge invariance .",
    "the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics can be derived from the gross  pitaevskii equation for a weakly non - ideal bose - gas .",
    "however , they are much more general than this model . they can be formulated from the most general principles of symmetry and conservation laws . indeed , deriving the two - fluid theory of superfluidity landau did not use the concept of bose - condensation .",
    "an elementary collective mode of the ideal liquid is a sound wave . in a sound wave",
    "the phase varies in space , i.e. , the wave is accompanied by mass supercurrents ( figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "an amplitude of the time and space dependent phase variation is small , and currents transport mass on distances of the order of the wavelength .",
    "a really superfluid transport on macroscopic distances is related with stationary solutions of the hydrodynamic equations corresponding to finite constant currents with constant nonzero phase gradients ( current states ) . in the current state",
    "the phase rotates through a large number of full 2@xmath19-rotations along streamlines of the current ( figure  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "the crucial point of the superfluidity concept is why the supercurrent is a persistent current , which does not decay despite it is not the ground state of the system and has a larger energy .",
    "the first explanation of the supercurrent stability was given on the basis of the well known landau criterion @xcite . according to this criterion ,",
    "the current state is stable as far as _ any quasiparticle _ of the bose - liquid in the laboratory frame has a positive energy and therefore its creation requires an energy input .",
    "let us suppose that elementary quasiparticles of the bose - liquid at rest have an energy spectrum @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the quasiparticle momentum . if the bose - liquid moves with the velocity @xmath22 the quasiparticle energy in the laboratory frame is @xmath23",
    ". the energy can not be negative ( which would mean instability ) if @xmath24 in superfluid @xmath1he the landau critical velocity @xmath25 is determined by the roton part of the spectrum .",
    "but in this review we focus on the long - wavelength collective excitations , which are phonons with the spectrum @xmath26 . then according to equation  ( [ lc ] )",
    "the supercurrent can not be stable if the velocity @xmath27 exceeds the sound velocity @xmath28 .    as far as one wants to check the landau criterion for long - wavelength collective modes like sound waves , it is not necessary to solve a dynamical problem looking for the spectrum of phonons .",
    "it is enough to estimate the energy of possible static fluctuations in the stationary current state with particle density @xmath29 and velocity @xmath30 .",
    "let us write down the energy of the current state taking into account possible local fluctuations of the particle density , @xmath31 , and of the velocity , @xmath32 , up to the terms of the second order : @xmath33.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the chemical potential and the energy density of the liquid at rest .",
    "one may neglect terms of the first order with respect to the density fluctuation @xmath36 and the velocity @xmath37 since we look for an energy extremum at fixed averaged density and velocity and the first - order term must vanish after integration . using the thermodynamic relation @xmath38 and omitting the subscript 0 in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , one obtains @xmath39 .",
    "%   \\label{ener }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quadratic form under the integral is positive definite , i.e. , the current state corresponds to the energy minimum , if the condition @xmath40 is satisfied .",
    "this condition is identical to the landau criterion equation  ( [ lc ] ) for the phonon spectrum @xmath26 .",
    "the theory of superfluidity tells that the landau criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition for current metastability .",
    "the landau criterion checks only small deviations from the current state .",
    "meanwhile the current state can be destroyed via _",
    "large _ perturbations of the current state . in superfluids",
    "these large perturbations are vortices . in the current state",
    "the phase rotates along the current direction .",
    "the current can relax if one can remove one 2@xmath19-turn of the phase .",
    "this requires that a singular vortex line crossed or `` cut '' the channel cross - section .",
    "the process is called `` phase slip '' .",
    "if the vortex axis ( vortex line ) coincides with the @xmath41 axis , the phase gradient around the vortex line is given by @xmath42}{r^2 } ,     \\label{vort }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the position vector in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "the phase changes by 2@xmath19 around the vortex line ( figure  [ fig3]a ) .",
    "creation of the vortex requires some energy .",
    "the vortex energy per unit length ( line tension ) is determined by the kinetic ( gradient ) energy : @xmath45 where the upper cut - off @xmath46 is determined by geometry .",
    "for example , for the vortex shown in figure  [ fig3]a it is the distance of the vortex line from a sample border .",
    "the lower cut - off @xmath47 is the vortex - core radius .",
    "it determines the distance @xmath48 at which the phase gradient is so high that the hydrodynamic expression for the energy becomes invalid .",
    "a good estimation for @xmath47 is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the circulation quantum of the velocity . inside the core the modulus of",
    "the order parameter goes down to zero eliminating the singularity in the kinetic energy at the vortex axis . for the weakly non - ideal bose - gas this estimation yields the coherence length .",
    "now suppose that a vortex appears in the current state with the constant gradient @xmath51 : the phase gradients induced by the vortex are superimposed on the constant phase gradient related to the current : @xmath52 .",
    "the total gradient energy includes that of the current , the vortex energy given by equation  ( [ vorenm ] ) , and the energy from the cross terms of the two gradient fields .",
    "only the last two contributions are connected with the vortex , and their sum determines the energy of the vortex in the current state : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the length of the vortex line and @xmath55 is the area of the cut , at which the phase jumps by @xmath56 . for the 2d case shown in figure [ fig3]a ( a straight vortex in a slab of thickness @xmath54 normal to the picture plane ) @xmath57 .",
    "one can see that vortex motion across the channel ( growth of @xmath46 ) is impeded by the barrier , which is determined by variation of the energy @xmath58 with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "the peak of the barrier corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "the height of the barrier is @xmath60 thus the barrier disappears at gradients @xmath61 , which are of the same order as the critical gradient determined from the landau criterion . in the 3d geometry",
    "the phase slip is realized with expansion of vortex rings .",
    "for the ring of radius @xmath62 the vortex - length and the area of the cut are @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively , and the barrier disappears at the same critical gradient @xmath65 as in the 2d case .",
    "the barriers stabilizing metastable current states are connected with topology of the order parameter space . in a superfluid",
    "the order parameter is a complex wave function @xmath66 . at the equilibrium @xmath67 , where the modulus @xmath68 is a constant determined by minimization of the energy and the phase @xmath69 is a degeneration parameter since the energy does not depend on @xmath69 .",
    "any current state in a closed annular channel ( torus ) with the phase change @xmath70 around the channel maps onto a circumference @xmath71 in the complex plane ( figure  [ fig2a]a ) winding the circumference @xmath72 times .",
    "it is evident that it is impossible to change @xmath72 keeping the path on the circumference @xmath71 all the time .",
    "thus @xmath72 is a _",
    "topological charge_. one can change it ( removing , e.g. , one winding around the circumference ) only by leaving the circumference ( the equilibrium order parameter space in the case ) .",
    "this should cost energy , which is spent on creation of a vortex .",
    "figure  [ fig2a]b shows mapping of the vortex state onto the circle @xmath73 .    without such topological barriers superfluidity is ruled out .",
    "however , barriers do not automatically provide the life - time of currents long enough . in practice ,",
    "dissipation via phase slips is possible even in the presence of barriers due to thermal fluctuations or quantum tunneling . here and later on",
    "we address only `` ideal '' critical currents ( the upper bound for critical currents ) at which barriers disappear leaving `` practical '' critical currents beyond the scope of the present review .",
    "the main interaction responsible for magnetic order is exchange interaction , which is invariant with respect to rotations of the whole spin system . then according to noether s theorem",
    "the total spin must be conserved . for ferromagnets where the order parameter is the spontaneous magnetization @xmath74",
    ", this means that the exchange energy can depend on the absolute value of @xmath74 but not on its direction .",
    "other contributions to the free energy ( anisotropy energy or dipole - dipole interaction ) are related with spin - orbit interaction , which does not conserve the total spin .",
    "but these interactions are relativistically small , i.e. , governed by the small relativistic parameter @xmath75 , where @xmath27 is a typical electron velocity and @xmath76 is the speed of light .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction does depend on @xmath74 direction , but because of its weakness can not affect the absolute value @xmath77 in slow dynamics .",
    "this is a crucial point in the phenomenological theory of magnetism of landau and lifshitz @xcite , which determines the form of the equation of motion for ferromagnet magnetization known as the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite : @xmath78 ,       \\label{llp }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the gyromagnetic ratio between the magnetic and mechanical moment ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the effective magnetic field is determined by the functional derivative of the total free energy @xmath81 with density @xmath82 : @xmath83 according to the landau - lifshitz equation , the absolute value @xmath77 of the magnetization can not vary .",
    "the evolution of @xmath74 is a precession around the effective magnetic field @xmath84 .",
    "at first let us discuss _ exchange approximation _ , in which relativistic effects are ignored and the conservation of total spin is not violated . in this approximation",
    "the free energy density is @xmath85 the first exchange - energy term @xmath86 , being the largest term , is crucial for determination of the equilibrium value of @xmath77 .",
    "but after determination of @xmath77 it can be ignored as an inessential large constant . indeed , its contribution to the effective field in landau - lifshitz equation ( [ llp ] ) does not produce any effect : the contribution is parallel to @xmath74 and vanishes in the vector product . in the absence of external fields , which break invariance with respect to rotations in the spin space , the landau - lifshitz equation reduces to the continuity equations for components of the spin density @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath89_i= - \\alpha [ \\bm m \\times \\nabla_j \\bm m]_i= -\\alpha\\varepsilon_{ikl }   m_k   \\nabla_j m_l       \\label{spcur }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the @xmath90th component of the spin current transporting the @xmath91th component of spin . thus in an isotropic ferromagnet all three components of spin are conserved .",
    "the landau - lifshitz equation has plane - wave solutions describing spatially nonuniform precession of the magnetization @xmath92 around the ground - state magnetization @xmath93 : @xmath94 . here",
    "the magnetization deviation @xmath95 is small and normal to @xmath93 .",
    "linearizing with respect to @xmath95 , one obtains spin waves with the spectrum @xmath96 in an isotropic ferromagnet spin waves at @xmath97 are accompanied by spin currents , but superfluid spin transport is impossible as will be clear from section [ stab ] .    next we shall consider the case when spin - rotational invariance is partially broken , and there is uniaxial crystal magnetic anisotropy given by the third term in the phenomenological free energy : @xmath98 if the anisotropy energy @xmath99 is positive , it is the `` easy plane '' anisotropy , which keeps the spontaneous magnetization @xmath93 in the @xmath44 plane ( the continuous limit of the @xmath100 model ) . in this model the @xmath41 component of spin is conserved , because invariance with respect to rotations in the easy plane remains unbroken .",
    "since the absolute value of magnetization is fixed , the vector @xmath74 of the magnetization is fully determined by the angle @xmath101 showing the direction of @xmath74 in the easy plane @xmath44 ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) and by the @xmath41 component of the magnetization @xmath104 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 in order to emphasize that @xmath104 is a small dynamic correction to the magnetization , which is absent at the equilibrium . in the new variables the free energy is @xmath106 .",
    "\\label{ener }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constant @xmath107 is stiffness of the spin system determined by exchange interaction , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath108 along the @xmath41 axis is determined by the uniaxial anisotropy energy @xmath99 keeping the magnetization in the plane .",
    "the landau - lifshitz equation reduces to the hamilton equations for a pair of canonically conjugate continuous variables `` angle  angular momentum '' ( analogous to the canonically conjugate pair `` coordinate  momentum '' ) : @xmath109 @xmath110 where functional derivatives on the right - hand sides are taken from the free energy @xmath82 given by equation  ( [ ener ] ) . using the expressions for functional derivatives one can write the hamilton equations as @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the spin current .",
    "there is an evident analogy of equations ( [ ep ] ) and ( [ em ] ) with the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eul ] ) and ( [ idliq ] ) for an ideal liquid , equation ( [ em ] ) being the continuity equation for spin .",
    "this analogy was exploited by halperin and hohenberg @xcite in their hydrodynamic theory of spin waves .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic ferromagnet with the quadratic spin - wave spectrum , the spin wave in the easy - plane ferromagnet has a sound - like spectrum as in a superfluid : @xmath114 , where the spin - wave velocity is @xmath115 .",
    "halperin and hohenberg introduced the concept of spin current , which appears in a propagating spin wave like a mass supercurrent appears in a sound wave ( figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "this current transports the @xmath41 component of spin on distances of the order of the wavelength . but as well as the mass supercurrent in a sound wave , this small oscillating spin current does not lead to superfluid spin transport , which this review addresses .",
    "spin superfluid transport on long distances is realized in current states with magnetization rotating in the plane through a large number of full 2@xmath19-rotations as shown in figure  [ fig1]b .",
    "let us consider now the case of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the simplest model of an antiferromagnet is two sublattices with magnetizations @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in the absence of weak ferromagnetism and external magnetic fields two magnetizations",
    "@xmath118 completely compensate each other without producing any total magnetization @xmath119 .",
    "however , a small magnetization @xmath95 does appear due to external magnetic fields or dynamical effects .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath116 and @xmath120 and their mutual orientation are mostly determined by strong exchange interaction , but the latter does not fix the direction of the staggered magnetization @xmath121 , which is the order parameter of a two - sublattice antiferromagnet.the equations of motion for two vectors @xmath122 and @xmath95 can be derived from the two landau - lifshitz equations for @xmath116 and @xmath120 taking into account the exchange interaction between two sublattices .",
    "but it would be useful to present a more general version of the macroscopic phenomenological theory , which is able to describe an antiferromagnetic structure of any complexity @xcite .",
    "the theory of spin dynamics in superfluid phases of @xmath0he developed by leggett and takagi @xcite also belongs to this class .",
    "following the same principle `` exchange is the strongest interaction '' as in the landau - lifshitz theory , macroscopic theories of this type deal with phenomena at scales essentially exceeding microscopic scales ( the coherence length in the case of @xmath0he ) , at which the exchange energy establishes the tensor structure of the order parameter .",
    "this permits to assume that the entire dynamic evolution of the order parameter reduces to rotations in the 3d spin state , which can not change the exchange energy .",
    "then the dynamics of the system is described by three independent pairs of canonically conjugated variables `` angle  moment '' @xmath123@xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 here @xmath127 are the angles of spin rotations around three cartesian axes ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "apart from spatial dependence of the variables , these equations are similar to the equations of motion of a 3d rigid top . in our case",
    "the top is an antiferromagnetic spin order parameter rigidly fixed by exchange interaction . as in the case of a two - sublattice antiferromagnet ,",
    "magnetization @xmath95 results from deformation of the equilibrium spin structure .",
    "the approach is valid as far as this deformation is weak , i.e. , @xmath95 is smaller than the characteristic moments of the antiferromagnetic structure ( staggered magnetization @xmath122 in the case of a two - sublattice antiferromagnet ) .",
    "since rotation around the vector @xmath122 has no effect on the state of the system the latter has only two degrees of freedom corresponding to two pairs `` angle  moment '' .",
    "then the equations become the equations of motion of a rotator .",
    "in contrast to the spontaneous magnetization @xmath74 in the landau - lifshitz equation ( [ llp ] ) , the small absolute value of the magnetization @xmath95 is not kept constant .    because the group of 3d rotations is non - commutative , the state of the system depends on the order , in which rotations around different axes are performed . in practice",
    "they frequently use the euler angles ( they are introduced in section [ heb ] ) . for the most content of part i ( except for section  [ heb ] ) , one can choose one degree of freedom connected with the conjugate pair @xmath129@xmath104 , and the problem of non - commutativity is absent ( further we shall omit the subscript @xmath41 of the angle @xmath129 ) .",
    "if the energy of the ground state does not depend ( or depends weakly as discussed in section [ phase ] ) on the angle @xmath69 , the equations of motions for @xmath69 and @xmath104 are the same hamilton equations ( [ hep ] ) and([hem ] ) , which were formulated for an easy  plane ferromagnet . in the case of a two - sublattice antiferromagnet",
    "the angle @xmath69 is the angle of the staggered magnetization @xmath122 in the easy plane .",
    "the discussion of this section has not made any reference to a concrete microscopic model of magnetism .",
    "indeed , the approach is general enough and is valid for models of magnetism based on the concepts of either localized or itinerant electrons .",
    "in particular , ferromagnetism of localized electrons is described by the heisenberg model with the hamiltonian : @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 are spins at the sites @xmath91 , and the summation over @xmath90 includes only the nearest neighbors to the site @xmath91 . in the continuum limit , when the spin rotates very slowly at scales of the intersite distance @xmath133 , the hamiltonian ( [ xy ] ) reduces to the free energy ( [ exch ] ) in the landau - lifshitz theory with the magnetization @xmath134 and the stiffness constant @xmath135 .",
    "the debates on reliability of the general phenomenological approach to magnetism are as old as the approach itself .",
    "nearly sixty years ago herring and kittel @xcite argued with their opponents that their phenomenological theory of spin waves `` is not contingent upon the choice of any particular approximate model for the ferromagnetic electrons '' .",
    "interestingly these discussions are still continuing in connection with the concept of the spin current , which originates from the general phenomenological approach .",
    "originally they connected spin supercurrents with counterflows of particles with opposite spins , for example , of he atoms in the a - phase of @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "bunkov @xcite insisted that only a counterflow of particles with opposite spins would lead to superfluid spin transport , thus ruling out spin superfluidity in materials with magnetic order resulting from exchange interaction between localized spins ( see p. 93 in his review ) .",
    "however , the spin current does not require itinerant electrons for its existence @xcite .",
    "the presumption that spin transport in insulators is impossible is still alive nowadays . according to shi et al .",
    "@xcite , it is a critical flaw of spin - current definition if it predicts spin currents in insulators .",
    "for the sake of simplicity further we focus on current states in an easy - plane ferromagnet , though the analysis can be easily generalized to other magnetically ordered systems discussed in the previous section . in the current state",
    "the spontaneous magnetization @xmath136 rotates in the easy plane through a large number of full @xmath56-rotations when the position vector @xmath43 is varying along the direction of spin current ( figure [ fig1]b ) .",
    "the spin - current state is metastable if it corresponds to a local minimum of the free energy , i.e. , any transition to nearby states would require an increase of energy .",
    "this condition is an analog of the landau criterion for mass supercurrents discussed in section  [ mass ] . in order to check current metastability",
    ", one should estimate the energy of possible small static fluctuations around the stationary current state .",

    "the space of degenerated equilibrium states is a sphere @xmath143 , whereas for an easy - plane ferromagnet this space reduced to an equatorial circumference on this sphere ( figure  [ fig3b]a ) .",
    "thus the order parameter space for an easy - plane ferromagnet is topologically equivalent to that space for superfluids ( the circumference on the complex plane shown in figure  [ fig2a ] ) .",
    "spin - current states are stable because they belong to the topological classes different from the class of the uniform ground state and can not be reduced to the latter by continuous deformation of the path .",

    "the order parameter must not vanish at the vortex axis since there is a more effective way to eliminate the singularity in the gradient energy : an excursion of the spontaneous magnetization out of the easy plane @xmath44 .",
    "this would require an increase of the uniaxial anisotropy energy , which keeps @xmath74 in the plane , but normally this energy is much less than the exchange energy , which keeps the order - parameter amplitude @xmath77 constant .",

    "thus a magnetic ( spin ) vortex has an additional topological charge having two values @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "the energy of the spin - current state with a vortex and the energy of the barrier , which blocks the phase slip , i.e. , the decay of the current , are determined similarly to the case of mass superfluidity [ see equations  ( [ vorcurenm ] ) and ( [ barrm ] ) ] : @xmath149 @xmath150 where @xmath54 is the length of the vortex line and @xmath55 is the area of the cut , at which the angle jumps by @xmath56 .",

    "this conclusion @xcite was recently confirmed by the analysis of knig et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an important difference with conventional mass superfluidity is that in conventional superfluidity the barrier , which suppresses supercurrent relaxation , grows unrestrictedly when the gradient @xmath186 decreases .",
    "in contrast , in spin superfluidity the barrier growth stops when the gradient reaches the values of the order @xmath187 ( inverse width of the domain wall ) .",
    "since the current relaxation time exponentially depends on the barrier ( whether the barrier is overcome due to thermal fluctuations or via quantum tunneling ) the life time of the current state in conventional superfluidity diverges when the velocity ( phase gradient ) decreases .",

    "finite_. this provides an ammunition for rigorists , who are not ready to accept the concept `` spin superfluidity '' ( or superfluidity of any non - conserved quantity ) in principle . _ in principle _ , one could agree with them .",
    "but _ in practice _ , whatever we call it , `` non - ideal superfluidity '' or `` quasi - superfluidity '' , some consequences should outcome from the fact of the existence of topological barriers suppressing relaxation of spin - current states .",
    "a key point is whether these consequences are observable .",
    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "from early days of discussions on spin supercurrents and up to now there are arguments on whether the spin supercurrent can result in `` real '' transport of spin .",
    "partially this is a semantic problem : one must carefully define what `` real '' transport really means .",
    "let us suppose that one has a usual superfluid mass persistent current in a ring geometry .",
    "nobody doubts that real mass transport occurs in this case , but how can one notice it in the experiment ? in any part of the ring channel there is no accumulation ( increase or decrease ) of the mass . of course",
    ", one can detect gyroscopic effects related with persistent currents , but it is an indirect evidence . what may be a direct evidence",
    "? one could suggest a _",
    "gedanken experiment _ in which the ring channel is suddenly closed in some place . in the wake of it one can observe that the mass increases on one side from the closure and decreases on the other side .",
    "this would be a real transport if one required a demonstration of mass accumulation as a proof of it . accepting this definition of transport reality one can notice real transport only in a non - equilibrium process , when the transported quantity decreases in some place and increases in another",
    ". naturally one can discard these semantic exercises as irrelevant for practice , but only as far as they refer to mass currents . in the case of spin currents in the past and nowadays spin accumulation",
    "sometimes is considered as a necessary proof of real spin transport .",
    "therefore , in old publications on spin superfluidity @xcite much attention was paid to possible experimental demonstration of spin transport from one place to another .    before starting discussion of possible spin - transport demonstration",
    "it is useful to consider a mechanical analogue of superfluid mass or spin supercurrent @xcite .",
    "let us twist a long elastic rod so that a twisting angle at one end of the rod with respect to an opposite end reaches values many times @xmath56 . bending the rod into a ring and connecting the ends rigidly",
    ", one obtains a ring with a circulating persistent angular - momentum flux ( figure  [ fig3a ] ) .",
    "the intensity of the flux is proportional to the gradient of twisting angle , which plays the role of the phase gradient in the mass supercurrent or the spin - rotation - angle gradient in the spin supercurrent .",
    "the analogy with spin current is especially close because spin is also a part of the angular momentum .",
    "the deformed state of the ring is not the ground state of the ring , but it can not relax to the ground state via any elastic process , because it is topologically stable . the only way to relieve the strain inside the rod is _",
    "plastic displacements_. this means that dislocations must move across rod cross - sections .",
    "the role of dislocations in the twisted rod is the same as the role of vortices in the mass or spin current states : in both of the cases some critical deformation ( gradient ) is required to switch the process on .",
    "there are various ways to detect deformations or strains in an elastically deformed body .",
    "similarly , it is certainly possible , at least in principle , to notice deformation ( angle gradient ) of the spin structure in the spin - current state .",
    "it would be a legitimate evidence of the spin current , not less legitimate than a magnetic field measured around the ring as an evidence of the persistent charge current in the ring .    of course , it is not obligatory to discuss the twisted rod in terms of angular - momentum flux .",
    "one can describe it only in terms of deformations , stresses , and elastic stiffness .",
    "so we must have in mind that there are two languages , or descriptions of the _ same _ physical phenomenon .",
    "a choice of one of them is a matter of taste and tradition .",
    "for example , in order to describe the transfer of momentum they use the momentum - flux tensor ( `` flux '' , or `` current '' language ) in hydrodynamics , while in the elasticity theory they prefer to call the same tensor as _",
    "stress tensor_. in principle one can avoid the term `` superfluidity '' and speak only about the `` phase stiffness '' even in the case of mass supercurrents .    let us return to possible demonstration of `` real '' spin transport .",
    "suppose that spin is injected into a sample at the sample boundary @xmath188 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the injection can be realized practically either with an injection of a spin - polarized current ( for the sake of simplicity we put aside the problem what happens with charge in this case ) , or with pumping the spin with a circularly polarized microwave irradiation . if the medium at @xmath189 can not support superfluid spin transport , the only way of spin propagation is spin diffusion described by the equations @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the spin - diffusion coefficient and @xmath192 is the time characterizing the bloch longitudinal relaxation , which violates the spin - conservation law . in the stationary case @xmath193 , and both the spin current and the nonequilibrium magnetization @xmath104 exponentially decay inside the sample : @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the spin - diffusion length .",
    "so no spin can reach the other boundary @xmath196 of the sample provided @xmath197 .",
    "now let us suppose that the medium at @xmath198 is magnetically ordered and can support superfluid spin transport .",
    "if the injection is so weak that the angle gradient @xmath141 is much less than @xmath187 , the perturbation of the medium by the injection can penetrate at the length not longer than the domain - wall width @xmath172 . so the injection pushes a piece of a domain wall into the sample .",
    "the spin current exponentially decays like in the medium without superfluidity .",
    "if the injection is so strong that the angle gradient @xmath199 exceeds its maximum value @xmath200 in a center of an isolated domain wall , continuity of the spin current on the boundary requires appearance of a soliton lattice with a period of the order or smaller than @xmath172 .",
    "this means that the spin current _ can reach _ the other boundary @xmath196 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath201",
    "one may expect a stationary soliton lattice with @xmath202",
    ". however , at the boundary @xmath196 the spin current must be injected into the medium without spin superfluidity .",
    "this is impossible without a finite @xmath104 , and the finite @xmath104 means that the soliton lattice _ is moving_. in the limit @xmath203 the soliton lattice is rather dense and one may neglect periodical spin - current modulation caused by inplane anisotropy .",
    "then spin transport is described by the equations @xmath204 @xmath205 with the boundary conditions for the supercurrent @xmath206 at @xmath188 and @xmath207 at @xmath196 .",
    "the current @xmath208 in the first condition is the spin - injection current , while the second boundary condition takes into account that the medium at @xmath209 is not spin - superfluid and spin injection there is possible only if some non - equilibrium magnetization @xmath210 is present .",
    "the coefficient @xmath211 can be found by solving the spin - diffusion equations in the medium at @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "it also depends on properties of the contact at @xmath196 . while the inplane anisotropy violating the spin conservation ( phase fixation )",
    "was neglected , one can not neglect irreversible dissipative processes , which also violate the spin - conservation law .",
    "the simplest example of such a process is the longitudinal spin relaxation characterized by time @xmath192 .",
    "the stationary solution of equations ( [ epb ] ) and ( [ emb ] ) is @xmath212 though the solution is stationary in the sense that @xmath193 , but @xmath213 .",
    "we consider a non - equilibrium process ( otherwise spin accumulation is impossible ) , which is accompanied by the precession of @xmath74 in the easy plane . but",
    "the process is stationary only if the precession angular velocity is constant in space .",
    "the condition @xmath214const , which results from it , is similar to the condition of constant chemical potential in superfluids or electrochemical potential in superconductors in stationary processes .",
    "if this condition were not satisfied , there would be steady growth of the angle twist as is evident from equation ( [ epb ] ) . as already mentioned above",
    ", the nonzero @xmath104 means that the soliton lattice is moving . in our case",
    "the soliton velocity is rather slow since it is inversely proportional to @xmath54 : @xmath215 .",
    "one can see that irreversible loss of spin is a more serious obstacle for superfluid spin transport than coherent phase fixation , to which most of attention was attracted in the literature . because of spin relaxation , the spin current inevitably decreases while moving away from the injection point , in contrast to constant superfluid mass currents .",
    "however , in a spin - superfluid medium this decrease is linear and therefore less destructive than exponential decay of currents in non - superfluid media .",
    "so one have a good chance to notice spin accumulation in the medium at @xmath209 rather distant from the place of original spin injection .",
    "this justifies using the term `` superfluid '' .    in the presented analysis we assumed that at the boundary the entire spin - injection current is immediately transformed into a supercurrent",
    "actually spin injection can also generate the diffusion current close to the boundary .",
    "however , at some distance from the boundary the diffusion current inevitably transforms into a supercurrent @xcite .",
    "if this distance ( healing length ) is much shorter than the size @xmath54 of the sample our boundary condition at @xmath188 is fully justified .",
    "similar effects take place at contacts `` normal metal - superconductor '' : the current from the normal metal to the superconductor is completely transformed into the supercurrent at some finite distance from the contact .",
    "spin injection is not the only method of generation of spin currents .",
    "one can generate spin currents by a rotating inplane magnetic field , which is applied to one end of the sample and is strong enough to orient the magnetization parallel to it . because of the stiffness of the spin system , the spin rotation at one end is transmitted to the other end of the sample , which is not subject to the direct effect of the rotating magnetic field .",
    "transmission of the torque through the sample is _",
    "spin current_. since the rotating field is acting on the phase ( angle ) of the order parameter , it can be called _ coherent _ method , in contrast to the _ incoherent _ method of spin injection .",
    "the coherent method of spin - current generation has no analog in superfluids and superconductors , since in the latter cases there is no field linked to the phase of the order parameter .",
    "referring to the set up shown in figure [ fig4 ] with spin injection replaced by rotating magnetic field , in the coherent method the magnetization @xmath104 is fixed by the frequency of the rotating field . in this case",
    "there is no threshold for spin - current generation , and the spin current appears whatever small the frequency could be .",
    "but if the frequency ( and @xmath104 proportional to it ) is low , the spin transmission is realized via generation of a chain of well separated solitons ( domain walls ) , which propagate to the other end of the sample .",
    "thus , a `` moving soliton lattice '' is another synonym for spin superfluid transport .",
    "long - distance propagation of solitons through a slab of the @xmath137 phase of superfluid @xmath0he generated by a pulse of a radio - frequency magnetic field has already experimentally realized by bartolac et al .",
    "this experiment was discussed in terms of spin transport in reference @xcite .",
    "now we focus on the experimental and theoretical investigations of superfluid spin transport in the @xmath216 phase of superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "the spin superfluidity in the @xmath216 phase has several important features , which distinguish it from the spin superfluidity discussed previously in this review .",
    "first , in contrast to what was considered earlier , observed spin - current states in the @xmath216 phase are dynamical nonlinear states very far from the equilibrium , which require for their support permanent pumping of energy .",
    "thus dissipation is always present , and speaking about `` superfluidity '' , i.e. , `` dissipationless '' spin transport , we have in mind the absence of additional dissipation connected with the spin current itself .",
    "second , while the previous discussion dealt with the transport of a single spin component ( @xmath41-component ) , in the @xmath216 phase spin vector performs a more complicated 3d rotation and the spin current refers to the transport of some combination of spin components .",
    "this combination may be called `` precession moment '' because it is a canonical conjugate of the precession rotation angle ( precession phase ) rather the rotation angle of genuine spin in the spin space .",
    "so one should discern two types of spin superfluid transport : transport of spin precession and transport of spin @xcite . in the experiment @xcite they used slightly nonuniform magnetic fields , and",
    "precession took place only inside the homogeneously precessing domain ( hpd ) .",
    "but for discussion of superfluid spin transport it is not so important , and in the following we consider only processes inside the hpd ignoring gradients of the magnetic field .",
    "the spin dynamics of superfluid phases of @xmath0he is described by the theory of leggett and takagi @xcite , which is an example of the general phenomenological theory of magnetically ordered systems in terms of conjugate canonical variables `` angle  moment '' , which was shortly discussed in section  [ magn ] . as well as in studies of rotating solid tops ,",
    "sometimes it is more convenient to describe spin rotations via the euler angles @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 ( figure  [ fig4.0 ] ) . in @xmath0he",
    "superfluid spin dynamics these angles were used by fomin @xcite , who , however , replaced the angle @xmath219 by the angle @xmath220 .",

    "the angle @xmath222 characterizes the resultant rotation of the order parameter in the laboratory frame , and in the limit @xmath223 ( no precession ) becomes the angle of rotation around the @xmath41 axis .",
    "the magnetic moments canonically conjugate to the angles @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath222 are @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 respectively , where @xmath104 is the @xmath41 component of the magnetization @xmath95 in the laboratory coordinate frame , @xmath226 is the projection of @xmath95 on the @xmath227 axis of the rotating coordinate frame ( see figure  [ fig4.0 ] ) , and @xmath225 is the projection of @xmath95 on the line of nodes @xmath221 , which is perpendicular to the axes @xmath41 and @xmath227 .",
    "the free energy density consists of three terms , @xmath228 , where @xmath229 includes the magnetization and the zeeman energies , and the gradient energy @xmath230 and the order - parameter dependent energy @xmath231 ( dipole energy in the case of @xmath0he ) will be determined later on . here",
    "@xmath232 is the magnetic susceptibility .    for the phenomena",
    "observed experimentally only one degree of freedom is essential , which is connected with precession , i.e. , with the conjugate pair `` precession phase @xmath217precession moment @xmath233 '' .",
    "in contrast to the mode connected to the longitudinal magnetic resonance ( oscillations of the longitudinal spin component ) , which was discussed in previous sections , the precession mode is connected with the transverse magnetic resonance ( nuclear magnetic resonance in the case of @xmath0he ) , in which @xmath104 does not oscillate essentially .    neglecting nutation ,",

    "their stability is determined like it was done in section  [ stab ] , but in the landau criterion , @xmath395 , and in the expression , which determines the barrier for vortex expansion [ equation  ( [ barr ] ) ] , one should replace the phase gradient @xmath141 with @xmath396 .",
    "the helical structure at the equilibrium ( and possibly in the metastable state ) is stationary and does not move . however , as discussed in section [ real ] , spin injection to a medium , which does not support superfluid spin transport , is impossible without some nonequilibrium magnetization .",
    "then the helical structure must move , but this motion can be blocked by pinning .",
    "the effect of pinning on moving incommensurate structures is well known @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the effect of coercivity on motion of domain walls .",
    "however , in the limit of high spin currents most effective for dissipationless spin transport pinning is suppressed due to strong overlapping of domain walls .",
    "if they overlap so strongly that the phase ( angle ) gradient does not vary in space , the pinning force must vanish .",
    "equilibrium spin currents are possible not only in helimagnets .",

    ". dealing with semantics it is difficult to decree strict rules and to reach a broad consensus . without trying to do it , we shall simply follow recent debates on the question when one may and when one may not use the label `` magnon bec '' .",
    "i start from a general argument why the term `` magnon bec '' is at least problematic ( but not forbidden ! ) .",
    "let us remind what did bec mean at the time of bose , einstein , and london when the concept was coined .",
    "the quantum theory showed that if identical particles are described by the bose - statistics , at low temperatures they can condense at the state of the lowest energy . since all bose - condensed particles are described by the same wave - function , the bec yields a new coherent classical field , which can not be imagined in the classical theory of particles .",
    "so from this point of view the non - trivial essence of the bec is appearance of a coherent classical field , which _ does not exist _ in the classical description of particles .",
    "returning now to the magnon bec , a magnon can be a result of quantization of a classical field ( spin waves ) .",
    "if one claims magnon bec , this in fact means that `` particles '' magnons can be described by a classical fields .",
    "however , this is a logical circle : first we state that we need to quantize a classic field and to introduce quanta of this field , then we tell that we should describe condensed `` particles '' ( quanta ) by a classical field .",
    "so we return exactly to the same classical field , which we started from !",
    "in other words , in this special case quantization of spin waves was not necessary . calling coherent spin waves by a bose - condensate of magnons , one must allow also to call laser modes  bose - condensates of photons \" , or deformed states of solids  bose - condensates of phonons \" .",
    "analogy between bose - condensates and coherent states was well known long ago @xcite .",
    "but analogy does not mean identity .",
    "some reasonable restriction should be imposed on using the term bec .",
    "it seems that more careful is to use this term only referring to objects , which can be particles in the classical limit .",
    "this means that coherent sound ( phonons ) , electromagnetic ( photons ) or spin ( magnons ) waves are not bose - condensates , but excitons in semiconductors are .",
    "however , no clever classification can avoid `` gray areas '' , where it fails to provide definite conclusions .",
    "can one call coherent polariton states as bose - condensates keeping in mind that the polariton is a superposition of an exciton and a photon ?",
    "i leave this question without an answer .",
    "putting aside this argument as too rigorist let us discuss various claims of `` magnon bec '' .",
    "they can be classified as equilibrium phenomena , or non - equilibrium ones , which require energy pumping for their observation .",
    "let us start from the equilibrium case of the phase transition to the antiferromagnetic state from the saturated ferromagnetic state in a strong magnetic field in magnetic insulators tlcuclo@xmath397 @xcite , bacusi@xmath398o@xmath400@xcite , and cs@xmath398cucl@xmath399 @xcite . the theoretical basis for it was known from 80s @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : the transition from the ferromagnet ( all spin parallel to the magnetic field ) to the two - sublattice antiferromagnet with spins of sublattices in the plane can be described in terms of magnon bose - operators in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "this transition is one from numerous examples of orientational phase transitions in magnetism .",
    "if the bec label is used for this case it could be used for any other .",
    "more generally , any transition described in terms of soft - mode instability ( e.g. , structure transitions in solids ) may be considered as bec",
    ". then the phenomenon of bec loses its uniqueness .",
    "reservations concerning using the term `` magnon bec '' for equilibrium phenomena were expressed in a number of publications @xcite .",
    "another class of magnon bec is non - equilibrium states , which require energy pumping for their support .",
    "there are two ways to support a coherent non - equilibrium state .",
    "the first one is to pump energy at the same frequency with which the phase of the coherent state varies in time .",
    "an example of such non - equilibrium coherent states is the coherent precession in @xmath0he - b discussed above in section  [ heb ] . in these cases",
    "there is a magnetic field rotating with the same frequency as the precession angular velocity .",
    "snoke @xcite called these examples of coherent states `` driven condensates '' suggesting that in such cases the word `` condensate '' was not appropriate and contradicted to the spirit of the term `` condensate '' as a spontaneous thermodynamic phenomenon .",
    "putting aside this argument for a while and accepting the view of bunkov and volovik @xcite , who considered the coherent spin precession as a bec phenomenon , the question arises why they do it only with respect to the coherent precession in @xmath0he - b .",
    "the coherent precession takes place in the nonlinear ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic resonances , which were studied more than 50 years . already at that time",
    "it was well realized that precessing magnetization may be treated purely classically as a gigantic magnetic dipole , which emits coherent radiation similar to dicke superradiance @xcite .",
    "later experimental evidence of this radiation was reported @xcite . following the semantic criteria of bunkov and volovik",
    "one may call it `` discovery of magnon bec '' .",
    "really spontaneous magnon condensation was observed by demokritov et al .",
    "@xcite in yttrium - iron - garnet films : they pumped microwave energy at higher magnon modes and observed accumulation of magnons in the lowest - energy magnon state , which corresponded to nonzero wave vector .",
    "it is important that pumped magnons were incoherent @xcite , so ensuing accumulation in a single state was spontaneous indeed .",
    "earlier the phenomenon was discussed theoretically by kalafati and safonov @xcite .",
    "condensation requires some threshold pumping level .",
    "accepting undisputed similarity of this phenomenon with bec , it is worthwhile to draw attention to another analogy , which is not less `` intriguing '' than the bec analogy : the analogy with lasers",
    ". keldysh @xcite defined `` lasing '' in his review on the exciton bec ( see p. 255",
    "there ) : `` the accumulation of a macroscopic number of initially incoherent excitation quanta in a single - photon mode is lasing '' . replacing `` single - photon mode '' by `` single - magnon mode '' one can apply this definition to the experiment of demokritov et al .",
    "on the basis of this analogy and since magnons are coupled with electromagnetic waves , one should expect coherent microwave radiation similar to laser radiation .",
    "this radiation was really observed recently by dzyapko et al .",
    "@xcite . radiation results from confluence of two magnons with opposite wave vectors ( one - magnon radiation is forbidden by the momentum conservation law ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the frequency of radiation is determined by the condensed magnon frequency but not the frequency of the pumping signal .",
    "description of magnon accumulation in a single state in terms of coherent magnon states was suggested many years ago @xcite by analogy with coherent photon states in lasers . on the basis of this idea",
    "recently rezende @xcite developed the theory of coherent microwave radiation detected by dzyapko et al .",
    "if it were possible to check coherence of this radiation , it would be a demonstration of _ magnon laser_.    in order to distinguish between bec and laser , it was suggested to use bec trademark only if there is a quasi - equilibrium distribution of non - condensed magnons with a well defined chemical potential that requires an effective magnon thermalization @xcite ( in lasers non - condensed photons are not in equilibrium ) .",
    "as one of possible semantic restrictions on using the term bec , this criterion of bec is formally legitimate .",
    "demokritov et al .",
    "@xcite experimentally demonstrated that magnon condensation in the momentum space in yttrium - iron - garnet films was accompanied with the quasi - equilibrium bose - einstein distribution of magnons . on the other hand ,",
    "since the property of coherence is related only with condensed magnons it is difficult to understand why the distribution function of non - condensed magnons is so crucial .    up to now we discussed the property of coherence but not of superfluidity .",
    "it is necessary to stress that coherence does not lead automatically to superfluidity as sometimes assumed @xcite .",
    "an example of the coherent state without superfluidity was presented in section  [ stab ] : an ( anti)ferromagnet fully isotropic , or with uniaxial easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "there is long - range correlation of spins in these cases , but no metastable spin - current states .",
    "the property of superfluidity is determined by topology of the order parameter for a concrete type of a condensed state .",
    "let us check it for various bec cases considered in the present section .",
    "the equilibrium phase transition in strong magnetic fields from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering certainly leads to potential possibility of superfluid spin transport : in the antiferromagnetic phase the strong magnetic field keeps the magnetizations of the sublattices in the plane normal to the field .",
    "so spiral structures with the antiferromagnetic vector rotating in the plane can be stable and provide dissipationless spin currents .",
    "the precession states in @xmath0he - b also can be accompanied by stable spin - precession currents as was demonstrated theoretically and experimentally ( section  [ heb ] ) . as for magnon condensation in yttrium - iron - garnet films",
    "@xcite , one can not expect superfluid spin transport in this case since there is no easy plane for order - parameter rotation in the experimental geometry ( the magnetic field was parallel to the film ) .",

    "as already stressed in the end of section  [ magn ] , presumption that spin transport requires mobile carriers of spin @xcite is not justified : for phenomenology it does not matter whether spin is transported by itinerant carriers or via exchange interaction between localized electrons .",
    "there were worries in the literature about ambiguity of the spin - current definition @xcite .",

    "this is a purely formal ambiguity of current definition ( like freedom to choose various definitions of potentials in electrodynamics ) , which must not lead to any ambiguity in physical predictions .",
    "this only means that any definition of current is not complete without accompanying definition of spin torque . in principle",
    ", it is possible even to avoid the spin - current term at all , treating the whole current divergence @xmath448 as a part of the spin torque .",
    "this would exclude the word _",
    "spin current _ from the scientific lexicon . as discussed in section",
    "[ real ] , one can avoid using such terms as _ flow _ or _ current _ , and describe the same phenomena using only concepts of deformation , spin stiffness , or torque @xcite . however , it is not necessary : in many cases the `` current language '' provides a very transparent physical picture of processes in various spin systems .",
    "there were also attempts to redefine the spin - current so that to eliminate the torque term @xmath449 from the spin continuity equation making it to look as a continuity equation for a conserved quantity .",
    "for example , shi et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also the discussion of their work by bray - ali and nussinov @xcite ) used the definition of a torque dipole term by culcer et al . @xcite rewriting the torque density as a divergence of a torque dipole density @xmath450 : @xmath451 the torque dipole density was included into the redefined spin current @xmath452",
    ". then the spin continuity equation ( [ sb ] ) becomes @xmath453 however , there is a payoff for this formally legitimate operation : the spin current becomes non - local since it is determined by an integral over the torque distribution in the whole bulk .",

    "recently it was suggested @xcite to detect an equilibrium spin current in the rashba medium by measuring a mechanical torque on a substrate at edges of the rashba medium caused by the spin current .",

    "according to the total angular momentum conservation law this leads to an edge orbital torque and to a flux of the orbital moment with a sign opposite to that of the spin current , as shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "since the 2d electron gas has no @xmath593 component of the orbital moment , the whole orbital torque must be applied to an edge of the substrate .",
    "now if the substrate is a cantilever rigidly fixed at one end ( figure [ fig6 ] ) , the mechanical torque @xmath618 will deform the cantilever , and the displacement of its free end can be measured .",
    "the fact that the spin current must be accompanied by an opposite orbital - moment current was already noticed by sheng and chang @xcite and zhang and yang @xcite .",
    "transformation of spin to angular momentum at an edge of the rashba medium was recently discussed by teodorescu and winkler @xcite . since the counterflow of the spin and the orbital moment does not lead to any flow of the _ total _ moment ,",
    "zhang and yang @xcite have concluded that the spin current is not observable and can not induce electric fields discussed in the beginning of this subsection .",
    "however , this conclusion ignores the fact that the spin and the orbital moments have different gyromagnetic ratios .",
    "therefore though the flow of the total _ mechanical _ moment really vanishes , the flow of the total _ magnetic _ moment does not .",
    "in fact , the orbital moment current , which compensates the spin current , is not an obstacle but an instrument for spin - current detection as is shown here .    for numerical estimation of the effect we shall use the maximal value of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath619 quoted by rashba @xcite for inas based quantum wells . when calculating the spin torque , it was simpler to consider the case @xmath594 .",

    "it is worthwhile to comment that ambiguity of spin - current definition , which was intensively discussed in the literature , has no impact on the effect considered here . as discussed in the end of section [ defsc ] , one may redefine the spin current @xmath640 by adding to it an arbitrary term ( @xmath641 ) but at the same time it is necessary to compensate it by redefinition of the spin torque ( @xmath642 ) .",
    "if the balance of the orbital part of the angular momentum is also considered , the definitions of the orbital torque and flux must be compatible with those of the spin part , in order not to violate the conservation law of the total angular momentum .",

    "was later called _ spin hall effect _ @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual hall effect , the spin hall effect originates from the effective magnetic field produced by spin - orbit interaction and does not require an external magnetic field for its existence .",
    "experimental evidences of the effect in bulk semiconductors @xcite , in a hole @xcite and an electron @xcite 2d gas have already been reported .",
    "observation of the inverse spin hall effect @xcite also provides evidence for the spin hall effect since the direct and the reverse effects are connected with the onsager relations .",
    "there are two possible origins for the spin hall effect .",
    "the first one , which was discussed by dyakonov and perel @xcite , is due to spin - dependent scattering on impurities and is called _ extrinsic _ spin hall effect . but broken space inversion symmetry also can allow an _ intrinsic _ effect , which is not connected with impurities directly , though can be strongly affected by them ( see below ) .    in general spin currents in the spin hall effect",
    "are not equilibrium currents considered in the previous section .",
    "they are accompanied by dissipation and require an energy input for their existence , despite that dissipation is related not with the spin current itself but with the longitudinal charge current .",
    "what does unite them with the spin currents discussed through the present review , is common controversies about their definitions and the impact of the absence of spin conservation .",
    "we consider the 2d electron gas assuming the presence of spin - orbit interaction and a weak electric field parallel to the axis @xmath593 .",
    "independently of the microscopic origin of the spin hall effect , the broken space inversion symmetry allows the current of the @xmath41 spin component along the axis @xmath323 given by @xmath648 where @xmath649 is the hall spin conductivity . in a uniform system with constant @xmath649 this current is constant by definition . on the other hand , at the sample border the spin current must vanish .",
    "thus one should look for a spin current of another nature or an edge torque , which would compensate the spin current of electric origin . according to dyakonov and perel @xcite",
    "( see also the recent phenomenological analysis by dyakonov @xcite ) another current is a dissipative spin diffusion current , i.e. the total spin current is @xmath650 , where @xmath651 this current is not constant because of inevitable longitudinal spin relaxation determined by the time @xmath192 .",
    "thus the continuity equation for the @xmath41 spin component is @xmath652 for the stationary process with @xmath653 and under the condition that the total current vanishes at the sample border @xmath188 one obtains @xmath654 where @xmath655 is the spin - diffusion length , which has already been introduced in section  [ real ] .",
    "thus the spin hall effect leads to accumulation of the @xmath41 spin component at the sample edge ( called also spin orientation ) .",
    "the degree of spin accumulation is governed by dissipation parameters @xmath192 and @xmath191 .",
    "a reader can find a detailed discussion of physical mechanisms responsible for dissipation in the review by uti et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extrinsic spin hall effect originates from the spin - orbit interaction related to the local electric fields induced by impurities or defects . a well accepted model for this interaction @xcite",
    "is described by the hamiltonian term @xmath656 ,      \\label{ex}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the electron momentum and @xmath657 is the impurity axisymmetric potential , which depends on the distance @xmath48 from the impurity .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on elastic scattering was known long time ago @xcite .",
    "the interaction leads to asymmetry of scattering ( skew scattering ) , and the differential cross section depends on spin of an incident electron : @xmath658,\\ ] ] where @xmath659 is an even function of the scattering angle @xmath660 and determines scattering of unpolarized electron beams , while @xmath661 is an odd function of @xmath660 called sherman function .",
    "the sherman function determines the skew scattering .",
    "the upper and the lower signs correspond to spins @xmath662 and @xmath663 .",
    "various types of impurities and of 2d quantum wells were discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we present the simple but general discussion in terms of effective cross sections similar to that by engel et .",
    "@xcite . a straightforward and physically transparent method to calculate a bulk spin current is solution of the boltzmann equation . studying the spin hall effect they usually used the quantum boltzmann equation , in which the distribution function was a matrix 2 @xmath664 2 in spin indices @xcite .",
    "however , for the extrinsic effect under consideration the @xmath41 spin component is a good quantum number , which is affected neither by external electric field , nor by spin - orbit interaction determined by equation ( [ ex ] ) . indeed , the effective spin - orbit magnetic field is normal to the 2d layer plane and scattering can not lead to any spin - flop .",
    "this means that off - diagonal elements of the spin - density matrix vanish .",
    "two diagonal elements correspond to two distribution functions @xmath665 for electrons with positive ( + ) and negative ( - ) @xmath41 spins . here",

    "knowing the non - equilibrium distribution function one can calculate the charge current parallel to @xmath401 and the @xmath41 spin current transverse to @xmath401 by integration over the momentum space and summation over two spin values .",
    "let us consider the zero temperature limit when @xmath678 .",
    "the charge current is given by the usual drude formula , @xmath679 while the spin current @xmath680 is determined by spin hall conductivity @xcite @xmath681 here @xmath682 is the ohmic electron conductivity .",
    "it is believed that the extrinsic spin hall effect was detected by kato et al .",
    "@xcite who observed spin accumulation on edges of @xmath72-gaas layers .",
    "engel et al .",
    "@xcite have found a rough quantitative agreement of the experiment with the theory presented in this subsection , though the signs of the effects were opposite .",
    "this disagreement remains unresolved ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic spin hall effect does not rely on spin - dependent effects in scattering but is related entirely to the uniform bulk spin - orbit interaction , which leads to spin - orbit - split band structure .",
    "the effect was proposed by murakami et al .",

    "@xcite in 2d electron systems with the rashba spin - orbit interaction . in the literature",
    "there were debates on the strength of the intrinsic spin hall effect in the 2d electron gas .",
    "relating the spin current to the acceleration of electrons by the electric field in a pure material , sinova et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that the intrinsic spin hall effect is characterized by the `` universal '' spin hall conductivity @xmath684 .",
    "originally it was believed that this result is insensitive to a small concentration of impurities , despite the fact that a steady state of a conductor in an electric field is impossible without collisions , which compensate the monotonous acceleration of electrons by the electric field .",
    "later on it turned out that in the rashba medium even rare collisions should not be ignored and eventually the intrinsic spin - hall conductivity at zero frequency vanishes in an infinite system ( see discussion and references in the review by engel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . but",
    "this conclusion is valid only for rashba spin - orbit coupling linear in the electron wave vector @xmath508 , and the intrinsic spin hall effect for rashba coupling nonlinear in @xmath685 , or in the luttinger model for spin - orbit coupled systems @xcite is not ruled out . the intrinsic effect in the medium with nonlinear in @xmath685 rashba coupling follows from the theory using the quantum boltzmann equation for the spin density matrix @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the extrinsic spin hall effect , the intrinsic spin hall effect is not possible without off - diagonal matrix elements since the @xmath41 spin current is proportional to them .",
    "this is because the bulk spin - orbit interaction keeps the spin inside the @xmath44 plane , and only correlation between eigenstates of the rashba hamiltonian ( like interference between plane - wave states near edges ) leads to @xmath41 spin polarization and @xmath41 spin currents .",
    "however , the experimental detection of the intrinsic spin hall is rather problematic .",
    "the experimental evidences of the spin hall effect reported in the literature were based on optical measurement of the spin accumulated on the sample edges presumably resulting from the spin hall effect . meanwhile ,",
    "spin accumulation ( polarization ) near boundaries might not be so simply related to spin currents in the bulk as repeatedly pointed out @xcite . as was shown above ( section [ eqcur ] ) , the bulk spin current is not necessarily accompanied by spin accumulation .",
    "moreover , spin accumulation at sample edges is possible even without bulk spin current .",
    "it was demonstrated for the ballistic spin hall effect @xcite , when the electron mean - free path exceeds the sample sizes .",
    "edge spin accumulation without bulk spin currents takes place also in the standard collisional regime when the electron mean - free path is much shorter than the sizes of the sample but still longer than the distance where interference of incident and reflected waves responsible for edge accumulation takes place @xcite .",
    "let us discuss edge accumulation without bulk spin currents in more details .",
    "since our goal is to analyze the case without bulk spin current , we may use the standard linear - in - momentum rashba hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , we do not need to deal with the quantum boltzmann equation and restrict ourselves with the classic boltzmann equation for two scalar distribution functions corresponding to two diagonal elements of the spin density matrix . indeed , according to references",
    "@xcite , for the linear - in - momentum rashba interaction bulk spin currents vanish together with off - diagonal matrix elements , to which they are proportional .",
    "in section [ edge ] it was shown that the eigenstates of the rashba hamiltonian are partially @xmath41 spin polarized near the boundaries , though in the equilibrium there is no total spin polarization after integration over the fermi sea .",
    "but in the spin hall effect there is a charge current ( along the @xmath593 axis at our choice of the coordinate frame , see figure [ fig1r ] ) , and the non - equilibrium distribution function has a component odd with respect to the wave vector component @xmath592 .",
    "first we shall consider the ballistic regime when the voltage drop @xmath231 occurs at the contacts , and there is no electric field inside the sample . in the narrow interval of energies",
    "@xmath686 around the fermi surface only left - moving electrons with @xmath687 are present .",

    "this divergence is canceled after summation over the two bands . however , our analysis is valid only if all relevant scales including @xmath720 are less than the electron mean - free path .",

    "they obtained the edge accumulation linear in the spin - orbit constant @xmath725 , which is insensitive to the details of the edge potential .",

    "_ 2 _  the collisional regime .",
    "]    originally the spin hall effect was defined as an effect related to bulk spin currents .",
    "the present discussion shows that spin accumulation is not really a probe of the bulk spin current : the former can be absent in the presence of the bulk current and can appear in the absence of the latter .",
    "therefore the question arises whether edge accumulation without bulk currents may be called the spin hall effect .",
    "a choice of terminology usually is a matter of convention , taste , or tradition .",
    "edge spin accumulation and spin currents require the same symmetry , and one may call the edge spin accumulation without bulk currents the _ edge _ spin hall effect .    in order to compare the edge and the bulk spin hall effects , we scale the latter using the `` universal '' spin conductivity @xmath726 , though in reality this is far from being universal @xcite . here",
    "@xmath494 is the bulk current of the @xmath41 spin . assuming that at the edge the bulk spin current is fully compensated with spin diffusion current ( section [ phen ] ) , the total accumulated spin is @xmath727 , where @xmath192 is the longitudinal spin relaxation time .",
    "so ratio of the edge to the bulk spin hall effect is @xmath728 .    for comparison with the spin hall effect observed in the 2d hole gas @xcite on may use @xmath729 , @xmath730 @xmath731 , and the accumulation area width 10 nm given by nomura _",
    "then the total spin accumulated due to the edge spin hall effect at @xmath700 is about 70 % of the experimental value .",
    "so the interpretation of this experiment in the terms of the bulk spin currents probably must be reconsidered even if the spin - orbit interaction for these materials should be described by a model more general than used for the present analysis .",
    "there are other cases of electrically generated edge spin accumulation without bulk spin currents inside the sample .",
    "adagideli and bauer @xcite discussed edge spin accumulation governed by spin diffusion , which occurred within the distance of the order of the spin - diffusion length @xmath732 from the interface between the media with and without spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in contrast , interference spin accumulation discussed above , is not related to any dissipative process and occurs at the distance on the order spin - orbit length , which was assumed to be much shorter than the mean - free path .",
    "it is interesting that the diffusion governed accumulation provides the total accumulated spin @xmath733 @xcite of the same order of magnitude as the interference mechanism . since @xmath732 must essentially exceed the mean - free path , the interference mechanism provides much higher spin density but in a much narrower layer .",
    "another example of edge spin accumulation without bulk spin currents will be discussed in section [ qsh ] addressing the quantum spin hall effect .      as was already mentioned , though transverse spin currents induced by the spin hall effect are dissipationless themselves , the whole process is accompanied by dissipation in the longitudinal channel and",
    "therefore requires an energy source .",
    "murakami et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also reference @xcite ) proposed the totally dissipationless spin - hall effect in insulators with spin - orbit interaction . in a band insulator at zero temperature and the fermi level within the gap between conductance and the valence",
    "bands a weak electric field can not generate an electric current , but may result in a transverse spin current , i.e. , the spin conductivity @xmath649 in the spin - hall relation ( [ she ] ) is finite being determined by topological invariants of the band structure",
    ". materials with this property are called _ spin hall insulators_. the dissipationless spin currents in insulators , when the fermi level is inside the forbidden gap , were revealed by numerical calculations using realistic parameters of semiconductor band structures @xcite .",
    "the spin hall effect is possible not only in band insulators .",
    "meier and loss @xcite considered the spin hall effect in a two - dimensional heisenberg model consisting of localized spin , in contrast to itinerant electrons in band insulators .",
    "the spin hall effect in insulators has a very important feature discerning it from the spin hall effect in conductors . since there is no charge current in the former case",
    ", there is no joule heating and no energy input @xcite . as a result , no dissipation process is possible , and the problem reduces to the equilibrium problem of an insulator in an electric field .",
    "the bulk spin current can not be compensated by the dissipative mechanism of dyakonov and perel @xcite , and one should look for a hamiltonian mechanism of absorption ( generation ) of spin near sample edges .",
    "so there is a close analogy between spin currents in the spin hall insulator and equilibrium currents in the rashba medium analyzed in section [ rasheq ] .",
    "indeed , the rashba spin - orbit interaction is connected with an internal or external electric field normal to the electron - gas plane .",
    "the electric field is not able produce a current since electrons are confined in a 2d layer .",
    "so the 2d gas is an insulator in the @xmath41 direction , but this does not rule out a hall spin current along the layer .",
    "the equilibrium character of spin currents in spin hall insulator impose a serious restriction on methods of spin - current detection .",
    "in particular , spin injection into a non - magnetic material without spin - orbit interaction is impossible , since in this material spin can be transported only by a dissipative ( diffusion ) current , which must be supported by energy pumping . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to extract spin from a spin hall insulator putting it into a contact with a magnetically ordered medium supporting dissipationless spin transport .",
    "recently great attention was attracted to remarkable properties of _ topological insulators _ , in which the quantum spin hall effect was predicted @xcite .",
    "the hallmark of a topological insulator is a forbidden gap originated from spin - orbit coupling and the presence of topologically stable helical edge states .",
    "topological criteria and classification for these materials have already been carefully analyzed @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this analysis most important for the goals of the present review is illustrated in figure [ figti ] . at two edges of the sample parallel to the electric field ( we address the 2d case ) each spin is able to move only in one direction , which is opposite for two spin directions .",
    "the edge states cross the whole forbidden gap connecting the valence - band and the conduction - band bulk continua .",
    "the system is time - reversal invariant , and two states with opposite directions of the spin and the wave vectors form a kramers degenerate pair . because of helicity ( one - way motion )",
    "the edge states are robust against elastic backscattering and therefore may be treated as ballistic .",
    "this means that the ballistic edge channels short - circuit the bulk insulator with infinite resistance , and the whole sample is globally a ballistic conductor without electric field inside",
    ".     drops inside electrodes ( see voltage distribution in the lower part of the figure ) . ]    thus , whatever the bulk spin conductivity @xmath734 could be , bulk spin currents are _ absent _ simply because the bulk electric field is absent .",
    "nevertheless , the voltage drop between two leads ( see the voltage distribution along the sample in figure [ figti ] ) leads to edge spin accumulation similar to that considered in section [ intrin ] for bulk conductors .",
    "however , mechanisms of the edge accumulation in two case are different .",
    "whereas in bulk conductors the spin accumulation arose from interference of electron plane waves reflected from the boundary , in topological insulators spin polarization appears because the leftmoving and rightmoving edge states with oppositely directed spins have different densities proportional to the voltage bias .",
    "the latter directly follows from the landauer - bttiker approach .",
    "the leftmovers occupy states below the fermi level in the right electrode , whereas the rightmovers occupy states below the fermi level in the left electrode ( figure [ figti ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two fermi energies is @xmath735 , and the edge spin density ( spin per unit length along the edge ) is determined by the number of states in this energy interval : @xmath736 where @xmath737 is the fermi velocity of the edge mode with the spectrum @xmath738 and @xmath739 is the effective `` spin '' of the edge states , which may be different from @xmath740 in general .",
    "the parameters of edge modes were calculated numerically and analytically using simple but reliable models @xcite .",
    "the word `` spin '' is in quotation marks since it is actually a combination of the electron spin ( which is @xmath740 of course ) and the orbital moment of the electron in the band .",
    "though it is dangerous to jump to general conclusions on which angular momentum eventually is relevant for various experiments , one may definitely expect that electromagnetic experiments ( kerr or faraday effect , induced electric fields ) address the magnetic moment in the edge mode .    for estimation of the effective spin related to the magnetic moment one can consider the model usually used for the topological insulator @xcite : the edge state crosses the forbidden gap separating the conduction and the valence bands , which originate from @xmath463-type ( @xmath741 ) and @xmath683-type ( @xmath742 ) atomic orbitals .",
    "the @xmath683-type orbital corresponds to quantum numbers @xmath743 for the total moment and @xmath744 for its projection on the quantization axis .",
    "the lande factor , @xmath745 is equal to the electron @xmath332 factor @xmath746 for the @xmath463-type orbital and to the factor @xmath747 for the @xmath683-type orbital . the edge mode is a superposition of the two states with the weights @xmath748 and @xmath749 respectively ( @xmath750 ) .",
    "then the effective spin in equation ( [ acc ] ) is @xmath751 using this value of the effective spin the accumulated magnetization is obtained from expression ( [ acc ] ) by multiplying with the electron gyromagnetic relation .",
    "it is interesting to compare the edge spin accumulation due to the quantum spin hall effect with the accumulation due to the intrinsic spin hall effect in conductors ( section [ intrin ] ) . introducing the average electric field @xmath752 , where @xmath54 is the length of the sample , equation ( [ acc ] ) at @xmath753 yields @xmath754 . comparing this with @xmath755 for the accumulation in conductors one sees that this transforms to the accumulated spin in topological insulators after replacing the relaxation time @xmath710 by the time of flight @xmath756 through ballistic edge channels .",
    "soon after the theoretical prediction the topological insulators were experimentally detected in the hgte quantum well @xcite by studying charge transport .",
    "it was demonstrated that at the quantum well thickness exceeding the critical value 6.3 nm there was an interval of gate voltages where the conductance reaches the value @xmath757 independently of the sample width @xmath758 ( see figure [ figti ] ) .",
    "this is a clear evidence of the ballistic transport through edge states while the main bulk is not conducting .",
    "the topological insulators states were also detected in bisb @xcite , bise @xcite , and bite @xcite compounds by the methods of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( apres ) . in the literature the topological insulator state",
    "is called also the quantum spin hall state .",
    "it is worthwhile of mentioning that despite impressive experimental demonstration of the quantum spin hall _ state _ the quantum spin hall _ effect _ itself is still wants its experimental confirmation : a `` smoking gun '' of edge spin accumulation have not yet been reported .",
    "the present review focused on four types of dissipationless spin transport : ( 1 ) superfluid transport , when the spin - current state is a metastable state ( a local but not the absolute minimum in the parameter space ) .",
    "( 2 ) ballistic spin transport , when spin is transported without losses simply because sources of dissipation are very weak . ( 3 ) equilibrium spin currents , i.e. , genuine persistent currents . ( 4 ) spin currents in the spin hall effect .",
    "the dissipationless spin transport was a matter of debates during decades , though sometimes they were to some extent semantic .",
    "therefore it was important to analyze what physical phenomenon was hidden under this or that name remembering that any choice of terminology is inevitably subjective and is a matter of taste and convention .",
    "the various hurdles on the way of using the concept of spin current ( absence of the spin - conservation law , ambiguity of spin current definition , etc . )",
    "were analyzed .",
    "the final conclusion is that the spin - current concept can be developed in a fully consistent manner , though this is not an obligatory language of description : spin currents are equivalent to deformations of the spin structure , and one may describe the spin transport also in terms of deformations and spin stiffness .",
    "the recent revival of interest to spin transport is motivated by emerging of spintronics and high expectations of new applications based on spin manipulation .",
    "this is far beyond the scope of the present review , but hopefully the review could justify using of the spin - current language in numerous investigations of spin - dynamics problems , an important example of which is the spin hall effect .",
