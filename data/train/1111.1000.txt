    "during the past decade the gravitational effective average action @xcite has been used in a number of studies trying to understand the renormalization behavior of quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) at a nonperturbative level .",
    "an important motivation was weinberg s idea of asymptotic safety @xcite according to which gravity might be nonperturbatively renormalizable and predictive if there exists a nontrivial renormalization group ( rg ) fixed point with a finite dimensional ultraviolet critical manifold at which the infinite cutoff limit can be taken .",
    "all investigations carried out so far point in the direction that the rg flow of the effective average action does indeed possess an rg fixed point with the desired properties @xcite .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the asymptotic safety program can be summarized roughly as follows @xcite :    * ( i ) * fix a set of fields @xmath0 carrying the gravitational degrees of freedom .    *",
    "( ii ) * pick a group @xmath1 of gauge or symmetry transformations acting on @xmath0 .    * ( iii ) * define a `` theory space '' consisting of all action functionals invariant under @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath2 | a ~ \\mbox{invariant under } ~ { \\bf g}\\}$ ] .    *",
    "( iv ) * fix a coarse graining scheme on @xmath3 , a background covariant continuum analogue of the kadanoff - wilson block spin idea @xcite .    *",
    "( v ) * compute the corresponding `` rg flow '' @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the vector field on @xmath3 obtained by applying an infinitesimal coarse graining step @xmath6 to all actions , and interpret @xmath7 as an element of the tangent space @xmath8 .    *",
    "( vi ) * compute the resulting `` rg trajectories '' @xmath9 as the integral curves of @xmath5 , i.e. solve the `` flow equation '' or `` functional rg equation '' ( frge ) @xmath10 .",
    "for the gravitational effective average action the coarse graining scheme is concretely defined by setting @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath12 is the functional hessian of @xmath13 and @xmath14 a cutoff kernel @xcite . for this choice ,",
    "@xmath15 coincides with the ordinary effective action , and @xmath16 is closely related to the bare action @xmath17 @xcite .    *",
    "( vii ) * determine the fixed points of the flow , i.e. try to solve @xmath18 .    *",
    "( viii ) * if there exists a fixed point , linearize the flow about @xmath19 and solve the linear system @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the jacobi matrix of @xmath5 at @xmath19 .",
    "its ( negative ) eigenvalues are the `` critical exponents '' @xmath22 and its eigenvectors are the `` scaling fields '' behaving as @xmath23 near @xmath19 .",
    "we say a scaling field is relevant ( irrelevant ) if it increases ( decreases ) when the mass scale @xmath24 is lowered .    *",
    "( ix ) * try to find complete rg trajectories , i.e. trajectories for which both the ultraviolet ( uv ) limit @xmath25 and the infrared ( ir ) limit @xmath26 exist .",
    "every such trajectory defines a quantum field theory ( in the sense of _ all _ modes of the fundamental field being integrated out ) .",
    "the asymptotic safety idea consists in taking the uv limit at a non - gaussian fixed point ( ngfp ) , i.e. to ensure the uv - regularity of the trajectory by arranging it to hit a fixed point asymtotically : @xmath27 for @xmath25 .",
    "for the case where the fundamental field is assumed to be the spacetime metric @xmath28 the viability of the above program has been tested to some extent and significant evidence for the existence of an appropriate ngfp was found .",
    "however , it is clear that other choices are equally plausible here . in einstein - cartan gravity , for example , the field variables are constituted by the vielbein @xmath29 and the spin connection @xmath30 assuming values in the lie algebra of the lorentz group .",
    "since @xmath30 can carry spacetime torsion , einstein - cartan gravity has in general more degrees of freedom than metric based general relativity ; only in absence of `` spinning '' matter the theories happen to possess equivalent classical field equations .",
    "the dynamics of einstein - cartan theory is encoded in the hilbert - palatini action @xmath31 $ ] which is of first order in the spacetime derivatives .",
    "interest in the field variables @xmath32 stems also from several modern developments towards the quantization of gravity which use related variables .",
    "this includes canonical quantum gravity with ashtekar s variables @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , spin foam models @xcite , and group field theory @xcite . here",
    "the hilbert - palatini action is usually generalized to the so - called holst action @xmath33 @xcite which contains an additional term , specific to four dimensions , whose associated coupling is the immirzi parameter @xmath34 . while the classical vacuum field equations implied by @xmath33 are independent of the dimensionless number @xmath34 , the corresponding quantum theory seems to depend on it . within loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , @xmath34 enters the eigenvalues of area and volume operators , as well as the formula for the entropy of black holes @xcite .    in order to explore the possibility of constructing asymptotically safe quantum theories of gravity in which @xmath29 and @xmath30 serve as the fundamental field variables ,",
    "we perform a first analysis of the wilsonian rg flow on the corresponding theory space . in section [ s2 ] of this contribution",
    "we describe the flow equation used and the theory space it acts on , and in section [ s3 ] we present the results obtained .",
    "finally , section [ s4 ] provides a short conclusion . for further details",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",

    "we consider the euclidean form of the theory , so that the relevant group of gauge transformations is the semidirect product @xmath40 . for",

    "in the quantum theory we also need to consider diffeomorphism ghosts and antighosts , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , and likewise @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the local @xmath42 transformations .",
    "we require all ghost and antighost fields to transform under @xmath39 and @xmath57 as tensors of the corresponding type .",

    "@xmath72 directions are relevant scaling fields , i.e. their associated critical exponents @xmath237 and @xmath238 are real and positive .",

    "are compatible with @xmath250 , i.e. the renormalization of the remaining invariant would solely be given by the renormalization of newton s constant . while this result needs to be corroborated by a more pecise treatment , we find @xmath251 within this truncation .",
    "these investigations suggest that the immirzi parameter owes its rg running to a nonzero cosmological constant .    *",
    "( viii ) * with respect to variations of the regularization scheme our results are remarkably robust .",
    "the signs of the fixed point coordinates and of most of the quantities that are expected to be universal are gauge parameter independent , as well .",
    "nevertheless , the quantitative gauge parameter dependence of the universal quantities such as the product @xmath252 and the critical exponents is somewhat stronger than in comparable calculations within metric gravity @xcite .",
    "we find significant evidence for asymptotic safety of pure gravity in the einstein - cartan approach .",
    "there seem to exist two ngfps , located at @xmath253 and @xmath200 , which in principle both are suitable for taking the continuum limit there . by investigating how observables depend upon @xmath34 in particular",
    ", one may determine the physical properties of the resulting quantum field theories . using either fixed point for the asymptotic safety construction , gravity is anti - screening in the uv , i.e. @xmath228 , but in contrast to qeg the cosmological constant is negative in the fixed point regime , @xmath229 .",
    "however , this does not contradict present day observations since @xmath72 might very well flow to positive values for ir scales of the order of typical astronomical distances .",
    "future investigations should aim at a better control of the gauge dependencies and at understanding the phenomenological implications of the scale dependent immirzi parameter .",
