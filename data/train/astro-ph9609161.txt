    "a very weak feature at 1176    was found by laor et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in three high s / n quasar spectra obtained by hst , and was tentatively identified as c  iii@xmath0 .",
    "the rich uv emission line spectrum of the narrow line quasar i zw 1 obtained by hst ( laor et al . in preparation ) allowed us to clearly identify this feature as c  iii@xmath0 .",
    "this line was previously detected in agns only in absorption ( bromage et al .",
    "1985 , kriss et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the line originates from radiative transition of electrons at the @xmath6 levels ( 17.1 ev above the ground level ) , down to the @xmath1 levels ( 6.5 ev above the ground level ) .",
    "given the high energy of the @xmath6 levels , the presence of significant c  iii@xmath0 emission appears surprising .",
    "in order to calculate the c  iii@xmath0 line flux we solved the equilibrium equations for the population of the lowest 10 levels of c  iii ( n=2 levels ) .",
    "collisional coupling of all levels , and radiative decay to all levels are included .",
    "the contributions of recombination ( mostly dielectronic ) and continuum fluorescence to the level population were not included since they are not important for the observed line flux .",
    "we find that for typical blr conditions which are able to generate significant c  iii]@xmath7 emission ( @xmath8 ) , the @xmath9 ratio is at least 50 times smaller than observed .",
    "the observed @xmath9 ratio is obtained for @xmath10 . but this ratio is obtained because @xmath11 is strongly suppressed at such a high density , and not because @xmath12 is enhanced .",
    "a high density component can not produce the observed @xmath12 flux even for a covering factor of @xmath13%          the observed @xmath9 is obtained for @xmath16  k. such a component was also inferred by kriss et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in ngc  1068 , based on the c  iii@xmath17 and n  iii@xmath18 lines .",
    "however , the overall observed emission line spectrum is fit well by photoionization models , rather than collisional ionization models .",
    "the @xmath19 produced by resonance scattering of continuum photons in the blr is : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the blr covering factor , @xmath22 is the velocity dispersion within the cloud , and @xmath23 is the line center optical depth ( for @xmath24 , the @xmath19 is increased by @xmath25 ) . the optical depth is @xmath26 , where @xmath27  km  s@xmath5 , and the sum is over the 6 permitted transitions contributing to the @xmath12 line .",
    "we get @xmath28-@xmath29 for @xmath308 - 10 .",
    "thus the observed c  iii@xmath0 @xmath19 of 1.4    can be produced if @xmath31  km  s@xmath5 , and @xmath32 .",
    "a similar process of continuum fluorescence was invoked by ferguson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to explain the strong c  iii@xmath17 and n  iii@xmath18 lines in ngc  1068 .",
