    "it appears that below @xmath216 and @xmath217 , the zpe becomes negative denoting that the _ ground state _  between a wormhole and a gravastar is represented by a wormhole whose radius has to be smaller than the gravastar radius .",
    "in this paper we have considered one loop corrections to the @xmath8 mass of a wormhole and a gravastar respectively .",
    "the motivation comes from the fact that a gravastar can represent an alternative to a black hole or a wormhole as regards the gravitational collapse",
    ". nevertheless various problems of comparison arise because outside the gravastar radius , the metric is of the schwarzschild type .",
    "if we adopt the energy point of view we find that , asymptotically , these configurations share the same @xmath8 mass and therefore even in this case they are indistinguishable",
    ". however , since the gravastar has a different core with respect to the wormhole , a difference between them can emerge from a zpe contribution . to this purpose",
    "we have computed an effective action to one loop , by looking at perturbations on the space - like hypersurface @xmath218 .",
    "since the perturbation involves only the spatial part of the metric , ghosts do not come into play for the energy contribution .",
    "therefore , only the graviton is important to establish what happens to the zpe .",
    "note that every form of zpe can be interpreted as an induced cosmological constant . in our case , this interpretation is very useful to apply standard regularization and renormalization procedures . in a sense",
    ", we can think that the zpe induced by a wormhole or a gravastar contributes to a cosmological constant . on the other hand",
    ", we can think that the induced cosmological constant could be used to give a sorting to zpe .",
    "it is interesting to note that , it is the double limit @xmath161 that denotes that something different appears in the throat proximity .",
    "this difference is principally caused by zpe or casimir energy which becomes so intense to create a thick barrier ( _ brick wall _ ) or a topology change ( _ gravastar _ ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to discover under what condition a wormhole persists or change into a gravastar or vice versa .",
    "it appears that a fundamental element to understand in which direction the geometry becomes relevant is in the radii ratio @xmath212 .",
    "note that the comparison between the gravastar and the wormhole is done with the same mass @xmath11 , as it should be .",
    "the other important parameter seems to be the renormalization point which , in this example , translates the presence or the absence of an energy gap between the external and the internal region of the gravastar .",
    "if one imposes the continuity of the zpe through the gravastar radius , one meets a constraint on @xmath197 leading to the plot of fig.@xmath207 showing that the region of permanence of the wormhole is very subtle .",
    "indeed , from inequality @xmath219 , outside the range @xmath220 , the wormhole appears as an _ excited state _  with respect to the gravastar .",
    "in particular , one should note that the minimum for the zpe difference appears for @xmath221 with a minimum value of @xmath222 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one abandons the continuity condition of the gravastar zpe and treats @xmath197 as a free parameter , one finds from fig.@xmath223 that the region of permanence of the wormhole is larger",
