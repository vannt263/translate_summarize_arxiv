    "the observation that vacuum einstein gravity in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions has no local dynamical degrees of freedom@xcite has created interest in 2 + 1 gravity as an arena where quantum gravity can be investigated without many of the technical complications that are present in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "several formulations of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity have been given , both classically and quantum mechanically , and it has become an issue to understand what the differences in these formulations are . for reviews , see refs.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall consider witten s connection formulation of 2 + 1 gravity@xcite .",
    "for spacetimes with the topology @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a closed oriented surface , witten s formulation and its correspondence with the metric theory have been extensively discussed ; a comprehensive list of references can be found in refs.@xcite .",

    "a connection formulation that reproduces the standard metric solutions on @xmath1 can be defined as the theory of flat connections on principal @xmath5 bundles over @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the component of the identity of the 2 + 1 dimensional poincare group  @xmath7@xcite . for @xmath3 a similar connection theory with the gauge group",
    "@xmath5 is well - defined , as we shall see , but it is not clear whether this theory in any sense describes nondegenerate spacetime metrics on @xmath8 .",

    "it will be shown that nondegenerate , flat metrics on @xmath8 can be recovered from four connected components of the classical solution space of this theory , and from one of the components we recover metrics that admit spacelike klein bottles .",
    "we shall also give an action principle for certain components of the theory , including these four .",
    "the action is sufficiently general to accommodate both the nonorientability of the manifold and the fact that the bundles are nontrivial in a manner involving the disconnected components of @xmath7 .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : connection ] by describing the connection theory .",
    "this theory is a modest generalization of that given in ref.@xcite , in that the three - manifold @xmath9 may be nonorientable and the gauge group is the full 2 + 1 poincare group @xmath7 .",
    "we first discuss the kinematics of connections on @xmath7 bundles over  @xmath9 , devoting special attention to gauge transformations and to the recovery of a spacetime metric on  @xmath9 .",
    "the equations of motion are then introduced by the requirement that the connection be flat .",
    "we next define a bundle to be orientation compatible iff the ( potential ) nonorientability of the base space intertwines with the ( potential ) nontriviality of the bundle in a certain way , and we construct for such bundles an action principle from which the equations of motion can be derived .",
    "@xmath5 bundles over oriented manifolds are orientation compatible , and for them our action reduces to that given in refs.@xcite .    in section [ sec : kbconnsol ] we specialize to @xmath10 , and we analyze in detail several of the connected components of the classical solution space . in section [ sec : metrics ] we demonstrate that four of these components contain points from which one recovers nondegenerate metrics on  @xmath9 .",
