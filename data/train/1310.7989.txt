    "hybridization is the mating between individuals from two different species .",
    "while hybridization introduces genetic material into a host genome , this genetic material may be transient and is purged from the population within a few generations after hybridization .",
    "however , in other cases , the introduced genetic material persists in the population  a process known as introgression  and can have significant evolutionary implications . in this paper , we introduce a novel method for detecting introgression in genomes using a comparative genomic approach .",
    "the method scans multiple aligned genomes for signatures of introgression by incorporating phylogenetic networks and hidden markov models .",
    "the method allows for teasing apart true signatures of introgression from spurious ones that arise due to population effects and resemble those of introgression . using the new method",
    ", we analyzed three sets of variation data from chromosome 7 in mouse genomes .",
    "the method detected previously reported introgressed regions as well as new ones in one of the data sets . in the other two data sets , which were selected as negative controls , the method detected no introgression .",
    "our method enables systematic comparative analyses of genomes where introgression is suspected , and can work with genome - wide data .",
    "hybridization is the mating between species that can result in the transient or permanent transfer of genetic variants from one species to another .",
    "the latter outcome is referred to as introgression .",
    "mallet @xcite recently estimated that  at least 25% of plant species and 10% of animal species , mostly the youngest species , are involved in hybridization and potential introgression with other species .",
    "\" introgression can be neutral and go unnoticed in terms of phenotypes but can also be adaptive and affect phenotypes .",
    "recent examples of adaptation through hybridization include resistance to rodenticides in mice @xcite and mimicry in butterflies @xcite .",
    "detecting regions with signatures of introgression in eukaryotic genomes is of great interest , given the consequences of introgression in evolutionary biology , speciation , biodiversity , and conservation @xcite . with the increasing availability of genomic data , it is imperative to develop techniques that detect genomic regions of introgressive descent",
    ".    let us consider an evolutionary scenario where two speciation events result in three extant species a , b , and c , with a and b sharing a most recent common ancestor .",
    "further , some time after the splitting of a and b , hybridization occurs between b and c ( that is , sexual reproduction of individuals from these two species ) .",
    "this scenario is depicted by the phylogenetic network in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    ", width=624 ]    immediately upon hybridization , approximately half of the hybrid individual s genome comes from an individual in species @xmath0 , whereas the remainder comes from an individual in species @xmath1 .",
    "however , in homoploid hybridization , where the hybrid offspring has the same ploidy level as the two parental species , hybridization is often followed by back - crossing ( further mating between the hybrid population and either of the two parental populations ) .",
    "repeated back - crossing , followed by the effects of genetic drift and natural selection , results in genomes in the hybrid individuals that are mosaics of genomic material from the two parental species , yet not necessarily with a 50 - 50 composition .",
    "thus , detecting introgressed regions requires scanning across the genome and looking for signals of introgression .    in a comparative framework , detecting introgressed regions can be achieved by evolutionary analysis of genomes from the parental species , as well as genomes from introgressed individuals .",
    "in such an analysis , a walk across the genomes is taken , and local phylogenies are ( or , genealogies ) are inspected ; incongruence between two local phylogenies can be taken as a signal of introgresison @xcite . however , in reality , the analysis is more involved than this , owing to potentially confounding signal produced by several factors , major of which is incomplete lineage sorting ( ils ) . as recombination breaks linkage across loci in the genome ,",
    "the result is independent loci that may have different genealogies by chance , which is known as ils .",
    "ils is common to several groups of eukaryotic taxa where species diverged recently and not enough time has elapsed for all genomic loci to completely sort , resulting in a scenario where introgression and ils effects need to be distinguished @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ] illustrates this issue , where local genealogies across recombination breakpoints differ due to ils , but also differ inside vs. outside introgressed regions .",
    "while other factors , such as gene duplication and loss @xcite , could potentially add to the complexity of the phylogenetic and genomic patterns , we focus here on introgression and ils .",
    "recently , new methods were proposed to detect introgression in the presence of ils .",
    "@xmath2 statistic allows for a sliding - window analysis of three - taxon data sets , while accounting for introgression and ancestral polymorphism @xcite .",
    "however , this statistic assumes an infinite - sites model and independence across loci .",
    "yu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new statistical model for the likelihood of a species phylogeny model , given a set of gene genealogies , accounting for both ils and introgression .",
    "however , this model does not work directly from the sequences ; rather , it assumes that gene genealogies have been estimated , and computations are based on these estimates .",
    "further , the model assumes independence across loci . of great relevance to our work here is a group of hidden markov model ( hmm ) based techniques were introduced recently for analyzing genomic data in the presence of recombination and ils @xcite ; however , these methods do not account for introgression .",
    "a recent extension @xcite was devised to investigate the effects of population structure .    in this paper",
    ", we devise a novel model based on integrating phylogenetic networks with hidden markov models ( hmms ) .",
    "the phylogenetic network component of our model captures the relatedness across genomes ( including point mutation , recombination , ils , and introgression ) , and the hmm component captures dependence across sites and loci within each genome .",
    "using dynamic programming algorithms @xcite paired with a multivariate optimization heuristic @xcite , the model can be trained on genomic data , and allows for the identification of genomic regions of introgressive descent .",
    "we applied our model to chromosome 7 genomic variation data from three mouse data sets .",
    "our analysis recovered an introgression event involving the rodenticide resistance gene _",
    "vkorc1 _ , which was recently reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "further , our analysis indicates that about 12% of sites within chromosome 7 are in fact of introgressive origin , which is a novel finding .",
    "further , when applied to two negative control data sets , our model did not detect any introgression , further attesting to its robustness .",
    "our model will enable new analyses of eukaryotic data sets where introgression is suspected , and will further help shed light on the tree of life  or , network of life .",
    "our study utilizes eight mice that were either newly sampled or from previous publications .",
    "details for the eight mice are listed in table [ samples ] in the appendix .",
    "newly sampled mice were obtained as part of a tissue sharing agreement between rice university and stefan endepols at environmental science , bayer cropscience ag , d-40789 monheim , germany and dania richter and franz - rainer matuschka at division of pathology , department of parasitology , charit - universittsmedizin , d-10117 berlin , germany ( reviewed and exempted by rice university iacuc ) .",
