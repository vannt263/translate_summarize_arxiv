    "the time reversal invariance of the equations of motion amounts to universal symmetry of fluctuation theorems and related equalities@xcite for the fluctuation of entropy production and particle current for mesoscopic systems , and thus plays fundamental role in the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the symmetries connect the probabilities of positive and negative entropy production@xcite , which are calculated from the time forward and reversed transition probabilities for quantum systems@xcite . in the classical markovian",
    "stochastic dynamics , the _ conditional _ probability functional of the trajectories satisfies a symmetry expressed by the probability functionals and heat .",
    "this relation is also called microscopic reversibility@xcite , and generalized to the quantum open systems by concerning the heat calculated from set of transitions of the reservoir states@xcite . on the contrary , we are interested in the transition probabilities between the system states instead of the statistics for dissipative quantities , and give an expression of microscopic reversibility .",
    "it is known that the induced absorption and emission by an external electric field are equally probable within the realm of the fermi s golden rule provided that the initial and final fock states are exchanged .",
    "absorption process can be seen as the time reversal of the corresponding emission process .    in this article",
    ", we show that a symmetry similar to that of the induced absorption holds for the macroscopic time - dependent open systems where the system couples to the reservoir . since the expression appears as a generic equation for the forward and reversed protocols , we call it as microscopic reversibility .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe our model and forcing protocol . and an expression of microscopic reversibility for open systems is derived in eq.([cyclic ] ) .",
    "then the microscopic reversibility is numerically verified .",
    "let us consider a finite system interacting with a macroscopically large reservoir at an inverse temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the system is externally controlled by a time dependent parameter @xmath1 , which is for example a spring constant for the case of a harmonic oscillator",
    ". therefore the total energy change of the system is caused by the external work done and the heat flow from the reservoir .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the hamiltonians of the system , the reservoir , and the interaction between them , respectively .",
    "let us prepare the initial state as @xmath6 which is the product of the canonical ensembles of the system @xmath7 and of the reservoir @xmath8 at the same inverse temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the partition function of the system is @xmath9 through out this paper , we assume that the interaction energy @xmath5 is small compared to the energy of the subsystem @xmath10 and the reservoir @xmath4 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for macroscopic systems , since @xmath10 and @xmath4 are the bulk energy , while @xmath5 would be proportional to the surface area .",
    "note that the assumption is different from the weak coupling limit .",
    "namely , the weak coupling assumes that interaction is negligible , and the perturbative analysis is available . on the other hand , in our case",
    "the interaction is not necessarily vanishing , while we require that the ratio between the interaction energy and bulk energy is negligible .",
    "the twice measurements scheme consists of the initial and final observations , ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "* at @xmath11 , we measure the energy operator @xmath12 , and gain an eigenenergy @xmath13 .",
    "the system state becomes the corresponding eigenstate @xmath14 , @xmath15 subsequently the total system unitarily evolves until @xmath16 as @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the unitary time evolution operator . for the time evolution , we require that the external forcing is switched off well in advance @xmath16 and _ the total density matrix would relax to an equilibrium state _ at @xmath16 , @xmath19 here",
    "@xmath20 is the corresponding energy operator at @xmath16 and @xmath21 is the partition function .",
    "eq.([relaxation ] ) comes from the equation at the level of matrix elements@xcite @xmath22 and the assumption of smallness of the interaction energy , and holds when acting on the local state of the subsystem as in eq.([cyclic ] ) .",
    "* at @xmath16 , we measure the energy @xmath20 and obtain some eigenenergy @xmath23 with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath24 .",
    "_ regarding the reservoir , we do nt perform any measurements_. the transition probability that the initial and final system states are @xmath14 and @xmath24 is then @xmath25 here the kraus operator @xmath26 describes the transition of the system state , and satisfies @xmath27 note that the matrix elements such as @xmath28 contain the reservoir variables .",
    "the second equality follows from the completeness @xmath29 , and the unitarity @xmath30 .",
    "+ similarly the probability of the time - reversed dynamics is calculated as well .",
    "firstly , let us define the reversed dynamics by reversing the time dependence of the system hamiltonian in eq.(2 ) as @xmath31 , i.e. the reversal at time @xmath32 . also , we start with the initial state @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the anti unitary time reversal operator of the total system .",
    "the partition function is defined as @xmath35 * we measure the energy @xmath36 at @xmath11 and consider the case that the eigenenergy @xmath23 corresponding to ( i ) , and the system state becomes @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath37 is proportional to @xmath24 when the energy @xmath23 does not degenerate .",
    "* at the final time @xmath16 , we again measure the energy @xmath38 and obtain the eigenenergy @xmath13 .",
    "the system state is @xmath39 .",
    "+ then the probability that the initial and final states are @xmath37 and @xmath39 for the reversed dynamics is @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the inner product of @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",
    "now let us show the relation between probabilities of the forward and reversed transitions @xmath43 here the difference between the forward and reversed probabilities goes to zero in the macroscopic limit . for this purpose",
    ", we apply the methodology developed in refs.@xcite and thermalization property eq.([relaxation ] ) .",
    "we rewrite the forward probability as @xmath44 the first equality derives from the cyclic property of the trace . in the second equality ,",
    "@xmath30 is inserted . also , with the use of the relaxation property of the density matrix eq.([reverse ] ) which comes from eq.([relaxation2 ] ) and the smallness of interaction energy @xmath5 with respective to the bulk energy , the contents of the curly brackets are just the inverse of the remaining quantities in the brackets @xmath45 .",
    "in this section , we numerically show the microscopic reversibility eq.([cyclic ] ) .",
    "see also the detailed numerical verification in ref.@xcite for various parameters and measurement basis .",
    "we consider @xmath46 site spin chain in the spatially inhomogeneous time dependent magnetic field .",
    "note that thermalization property has been observed in relatively small system sizes@xcite . in the context of quantum derivation of thermal state ,",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space , which exponentially depends on the system size plays essential role@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is given as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath49 component of the pauli matrix .",
    "the sites @xmath50 and @xmath51 are regarded as the subsystem and reservoir .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 and switched off after @xmath54 .",
    "the initial state is prepared as @xmath55 we calculated the forward and reversed transition probabilities in fig.1 .",
    "the parameters are chosen as follows .",
    "the exchange interactions at each site are @xmath56 , the @xmath57 component of the magnetic field is expressed by the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and similarly the @xmath60 component of the magnetic field is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the inverse temperature is @xmath66 and the switching time is @xmath67 .",
    "the unitary time evolution @xmath68 is discretized as @xmath69 with the time step @xmath70 which is much shorter than the time scale of external perturbation .",
    "initially , we measure the eigenstate of @xmath71 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue . the measurement basis at @xmath16 is chosen as the eigenstate of @xmath72 which corresponds to the second largest eigenvalue .",
    "note that there are no crossing of time dependent energy levels of the subsystem , and eq.([reverse ] ) holds also for the transitions to other three eigenstates .",
    "it is remarkable that the time dependence of the forward and reversed transition probabilities are similar as a function of time even after the quench at @xmath73 .",
    "we have derived an expression of microscopic reversibility for macroscopic quantum open systems .",
    "the microscopic reversibility is trivial for the transition probability of unitary time evolution for the total system .",
    "similar reversibility is well - known for the transition probabilities of induced absorption and emission under the influence of an electric field in equilibrium .",
    "the microscopic reversibility is regarded as a generalization to the case of generic time - dependent perturbation .",
    "therefore , it is a symmetry holds in generic macroscopic quantum open systems . the microscopic reversibility is numerically verified for a spin chain with time - dependent perturbation . in the context of the quantum generalization of the reversibility for the classical conditional probability functional , ref.@xcite derives another symmetry for the quantum trajectories . the main difference from ref.@xcite is the quantity which we measure , number of measurements , and the definition of the reversed process . here we pursue and measure the system states .",
    "this is a useful property of the present scheme , since the system variables are expected to be much easier to measure with sufficient accuracy compared to those of the spatially extended large reservoir .",
