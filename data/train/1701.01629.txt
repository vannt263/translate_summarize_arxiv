    "quantum deficit is a kind of nonclassical correlation besides entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "quantum deficit @xcite originates on asking how to use nonlocal operation to extract work from a correlated system coupled to a heat bath only in the case of pure states @xcite . in the general case , the advantage is related to more general forms of quantum correlations . oppenheim _",
    "defined the work deficit @xcite is a measure of the difference between the information of the whole system and the localizable information @xcite .",
    "recently , streltsov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite give the definition of the one - way information deficit by means of relative entropy , which is also called one - way deficit that uncovers an important role of quantum deficit as a resource for the distribution of entanglement .",
    "many developments in quantum information processing @xcite has provided much insight into quantum phase transitions @xcite . especially , quantum correlations has been successful in characterizing a large number of critical phenomena of great interest . in particular , entanglement was the first and most outstanding member to detect a number of critical points , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum discord is an outstanding quantum correlation , is also used to study quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "another indication of quantumness that is also found its applications for probing quantum phases and quantum phase transition @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically calculate the one - way deficit of the thermal ground state of two adjacent spins in the bulk of the @xmath0 model .",
    "we find that the one - way deficit may characterize the quantum phase transition in the @xmath1 model and the transverse field ising model that the @xmath0 model reduces to for specified parameters . in details",
    ", we find the phenomenon of sudden death of the one - way deficit in @xmath1 model as the strength of transverse field increases to the critical point ; the one - way deficit of nearby two spins arrives its maximal value almost at the critical point of transverse field ising model .",
    "our results will enlighten extensive studies of the quantum information properties of ground states in different phases of critical systems . on the contrary",
    ", it will also benefit many applications such as to detect the quantum phase transition and to evaluate the capacity of quantum computations in critical systems .",
    "one - way deficit by von neumann measurement on one side is given by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes to the von neumann entropy .",
    "as a kind of quantum correlations besides entanglement and quantum discord , one - way deficit links quantum thermodynamics with quantum correlations and deserve further investigations in critical systems .",
    "then , we will consider the @xmath0 model @xcite in the zero - temperature case .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model is as follows @xcite : @xmath4\\label{ha}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 being the number of spins in the chain , @xmath6 the @xmath7th spin pauli operator in the direction @xmath8 and periodic boundary conditions assumed .",
    "the @xmath1 model and transverse field ising model thus correspond to the special cases for this general class of models . for the case that @xmath9 , our model reduces to @xmath1 model .",
