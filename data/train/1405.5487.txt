    "based on combined 3-year data , the icecube collaboration has reported recently@xmath0 the discovery of a diffuse background of high energy ( he ) astrophysical neutrinos with energy above 60 tev that extends at least up to 3 pev , in excess ( 5.7@xmath1 significance level ) of that produced by cosmic ray ( cr ) interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the neutrino events did not point back to any identified sources and are consistent with an isotropic distribution of arrival directions .",
    "their best fit power - law to the energy flux per flavor above 60 tev is @xmath2    so far , the origin of this diffuse background of high energy neutrinos is not known .",
    "a natural source of high energy astrophysical neutrinos is the decay of mesons produced in collisions of cr nuclei with matter and radiation .",
    "several models of cosmic ray production of neutrinos in / near cosmic ray sources@xmath3 have been used to estimate the astrophysical diffuse background of high energy neutrinos .",
    "but , uncertain assumptions and free adjustable parameters prevented meaningful conclusions .",
    "moreover , no evidence of neutrino emission from point - like or extended cr sources was found in four years of icecube data@xmath4 .",
    "these include supernova remnants , the nearest most luminous gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) such as@xmath5 130427a at redshift @xmath6 , the giant elliptical galaxy m87 at a distance of 16 mpc that contains the nearest active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in the northern sky , and markarian 421 , at a distance of 133 mpc , the brightest @xmath7-ray blazar in the northern sky .",
    "in particular , the null detection of high energy neutrinos with icecube from 100 stacked grbs has been used to set a strong limit on the contribution of grbs to the diffuse background of high energy neutrinos@xmath8 .",
    "but , this flux limit was based on the assumption that the neutrino emission in grbs roughly coincides in time and beaming with the prompt gamma - ray and early afterglow emissions , as expected@xmath9 in the fireball models of grbs .",
    "grb neutrinos , however , may be produced mainly through _ hadronic production of mesons by grb cosmic rays in the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) where most core colapse sne take place _ rather than through photo - production of mesons , which are assumed to take place in grb `` fireballs '' during their prompt gamma ray and early afterglow emissions@xmath9 .",
    "such hadronic production of mesons , which is expected in the cannonball model of grbs@xmath10 , is delayed and spread over much larger beaming angles than the prompt gamma ray and early afterglow emissions ( the early time gev emission from grbs observed with fermi - lat , most probably , is not from @xmath11 decay but from inverse compton scattering by the high energy electrons of their self emitted synchrotron radiation@xmath12 ) .",
    "a large spread in the neutrino arrival times ( due to cr diffusion through the gmc ) reduces the detected flux from individual grbs and stacked grbs .",
    "hence , limits on the flux of grb neutrinos@xmath8 based on no detection in selected time and sky windows centered on visible grbs may not be applicable to the diffuse flux of neutrinos from all past grbs , which may contribute significantly and even dominate the isotropic component of the diffuse background of high energy neutrinos .",
    "moreover , in this letter , we show that the spectrum , sky distribution and intensity of the diffuse background of high energy neutrinos recently discovered with the icecube detector@xmath0 are compatible with those of a non - isotropic galactic background expected from hadronic collisions of very high energy cosmic rays in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) plus an isotropic extragalactic background expected from hadronic collisions near source and in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) of high energy cosmic rays accelerated by the highly relativistic jets , which produce grbs in star forming galaxies .",
    "because of feynman scaling@xmath13 , very high energy ( vhe ) cosmic rays with a power - law flux @xmath14 per - nucleon that collide with the baryons of an `` optically thin '' gas produce mesons whose leptonic and semileptonic decays produce neutrinos at a rate @xmath15 per unit volume . the constant @xmath16 depends@xmath17 only on the power - law index @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the inelastic pp cross section , and @xmath20 is the baryon density of the gas . since the average energy of the produced neutrinos is @xmath21 that of the cr nucleons , production of neutrinos in the 60 tev - 3 pev energy - range requires cr nuclei with energy _ per nucleon _ well above the cr `` knee '' where @xmath22 mb . the cr flux _ per nucleon _ in the 100 pev - 10 eev energy range is roughly@xmath23 @xmath24 with @xmath25gev .",
    "this flux represents quite well the cr flux _ per nucleon",
    "_ between the cr knee and cr ankle .",
    "presumably , these very high energy ( vhe ) crs are accelerated by the highly relativistic jets of supernovae of type ic that produce grbs , most of which point away from earth@xmath26 .",
    "most of the gas and dust in the galaxy ( @xmath27 ) resides in a relatively thin galactic disc whose mean surface density within @xmath28 kpc from its center is@xmath29 @xmath30 , and beyond it the mid plane density drops exponentially in the radial direction like @xmath31 $ ] with @xmath32 with a scale height @xmath33 kpc and where @xmath34 kpc is the distance of the solar system from the center of the disc . this gas and dust",
    "are embedded in a large cosmic ray halo with roughly a constant density in the galactic disc .",
    "hence , the total neutrino luminosity of the galaxy is given roughly by @xmath35 where @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "a rough estimate of the neutrino event rate in icecube due to galactic @xmath38 with @xmath39 tev , is @xmath40 is the mean effective area of icecube for neutrinos of the @xmath41 flavors ( assuming equal mixing due to oscillations ) .",
    "for an energy - weighted@xmath3 @xmath42 above 60 tev , and @xmath43 as parametrized in reference 14 , eq.(3 ) yields @xmath44 neutrino events pointing back to the galactic disc and peaked towards the galactic center .",
    "the contribution of crs accelerated in episodes of mass accretion onto the galactic central massive black hole may contribute significantly to this concentration . all together",
    ", the energy spectrum of these galactic neutrino background is expected to have an @xmath45 spectrum , and its sky distribution is expected to follow roughly that of the diffuse galactic gamma rays in the energy range 100 mev - 100 gev , which are produced mostly by hadronic @xmath11 production and leptonic bremsstrahlung in the galactic disc and are not absorbed significantly by the background light in the galaxy .",
    "there is mounting observational evidence that long duration grbs and their afterglows are produced by the interaction of highly relativistic jets of plasmoids ( cannonballs ) of ordinary matter ejected in stripped envelope supernova explosions , mainly of type ic , with the radiation and matter along the jets trajectories@xmath46 .",
    "in particular , the prompt @xmath7-ray pulses and early - time x - ray flares are produced by the jet electrons through inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of photons in a light halo ( glory ) surrounding the progenitor star . such a light halo is formed by scattered stellar light from ejecta of pre - supernova eruptions@xmath47 .",
    "thus , the total kinetic energy of the baryons in the jet is @xmath48 times @xmath49 , the total emitted gamma ray energy .",
    "the jet decelerates by the swept in particles in front of it .",
    "its random magnetic fields transform its kinetic energy by fermi acceleration to crs energy with a spectrum @xmath50 .",
    "the crs escaoe the jet by diffusion through its random magnetic fields . for a kolmogorov spectrum@xmath51 of the random magnetic fields ,",
    "their diffusion coefficient is @xmath52 , which yields a residence time @xmath53 and a cr flux @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the cr jets move through the gmcs with practically the speed of light and produce narrow beams of high energy neutrinos mainly through @xmath56 and @xmath16 production in hadronic collisions with the baryons along their path in the gmcs . under the assumption of feynman scaling@xmath13 , cr spectrum @xmath57 , and a baryonic column density @xmath58 of the gmc , roughly , a fraction@xmath59 @xmath60 of the cr flux is converted to @xmath61 flux with the same @xmath62 power - law energy spectrum .",
    "star formation in gmcs in the local universe ( redshift @xmath63 ) seems to have a threshold around a surface density@xmath64 @xmath65 , i.e. , a baryon column density @xmath66 .",
    "such a column density is consistent with the mean column density @xmath67 inferred@xmath68 from x - ray absorption after correcting it for the observed metallicity@xmath69 of grb host galaxies @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "hence , for a ballistic motion of the jet with approximately the speed of light through the gmc , we adop @xmath72 .    assuming isotropic emission , the gamma ray energy emitted by a grb is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the grb luminosity distance in a flat @xmath75cdm universe with a hubble constant @xmath76 km / s mpc , matter density @xmath77 , dark energy density @xmath78 and baryon density @xmath79 , all in critical mass units@xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the observed @xmath7-ray fluence from the grb . if the @xmath7-ray energy is beamed into a solid angle @xmath82 , then the true grb gamma - ray energy is @xmath83 , and the true grb rate is @xmath84 . consequently , the total power in @xmath7-ray emission by grbs at redshift @xmath85 is @xmath86 _ independent of the beaming angle of grbs_.    noting that the full sky rate of grbs is@xmath87 @xmath88 , the flux of grb neutrinos of all flavors per sr at earth can be written as @xmath89 ^ 2}\\,\\left[{e\\over   m_p}\\right]^{-1/3}\\ ] ] where the summation extends over all @xmath90 long duration grbs with known redshift and @xmath91 , which were reported before may 15 , 2014 in the greiner catalog of grbs@xmath92 and in the gcn circulars archive@xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the distribution of such long grbs as function of @xmath85 is shown in fig .  1 .    for that distribution , eq .",
    "( 5 ) yields @xmath94 _ per neutrino flavor_.    to a very good approximation , all the vhe cosmic ray nuclei from grbs reach shortly ( on a cosmic time - scale ) the igm without any energy loss . in the igm",
    ", they continue to produce neutrinos in collisions with the igm baryons .",
    "most of the baryons in the universe ( @xmath95 reside in the igm with a density @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the effective column density encountered by a cr nucleon , which is ejected into the igm at redshift @xmath85 , is @xmath97 . using a conversion coefficient @xmath98 for such @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the igm contribution to the diffuse vhe energy isotropic neutrino background due to grbs is @xmath100 _ per neutrino flavor_.",
    "the bolometric luminosity per unit volume in the local universe ( @xmath101 ) is@xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of our milky way ( mw ) galaxy is @xmath104 .",
    "the ratio @xmath105 is approximately also the observed ratio of their core collapse supernova rates and consequently also of their grb rates . assuming that the vhe neutrino luminosity of external galaxies ( eg ) due to hadronic cr interactions in their ism is proportional to their grb rates , then a rough estimate of the cummulative neutrino flux from all external galaxies is @xmath106 the factor 2.9 is the effective value of @xmath107 inferred from grbs x - ray absorption in the grb host galaxies , weighted by the star formation history@xmath108 as in eq .",
    "( 6 ) yields an estimated @xmath109 contribution to the diffuse extragalactic background of vhe neutrinos , where @xmath110 is the average galactic neutrino background per sr .",
    "meson production in hadronic interactions of very high energy cosmic rays in the galactic ism is expected to produce a diffuse galactic background of very high energy neutrinos with an energy flux @xmath111 .",
    "the predicted number of galactic neutrino events ( all flavors ) in icecube with @xmath112 tev is roughly 3.6 events per year .",
    "their neutrino arrival directions are expected to trace the ism column density in their arrival directions , i.e. , point back mainly to the galactic disc with a concentration towards the galactic center .",
    "their sky distribution is expected to follow closely that of the diffuse galactic gamma ray background in the energy range 100 mev - 100 gev where the ism is transparent to the @xmath7-rays that are produced mostly by @xmath11 decay and leptonic bremsstrahlung .",
    "meson production in hadronic interactions of very high energy cosmic rays accelerated by the highly relativisic jets , which produce grbs within giant molecular clouds in star forming galaxies , where most grbs take place , is expected to produce an isotropic background of very high energy neutrinos with a per flavor flux @xmath113 .",
    "such an energy flux produces @xmath114 neutrino events per year with @xmath112 tev in the icecube detector .",
    "cosmic ray interactions in the ism of external galaxies are expected to contribute to the _ isotropic _ background of very high energy neutrinos a per flavor energy flux @xmath115 .",
    "such an energy flux produces @xmath116 neutrino events per year with @xmath112 tev in the icecube detector .",
    "fig .  2 , compares the per - flavor flux@xmath0 of vhe neutrinos with energy above 60 tev measured with icecube@xmath0 and the predicted flux due to the hadronic interaction of cosmic rays in the galactic ism ( represented there by an equivalent isotropic mw flux ) , in giant molecular clouds of star forming galaxies where most core collapse supernovae , and hence grbs , take place , and in the igm .",
    "it shows that the predicted flux is compatible with that observed by icecube .",
    "special effort was made to base our estimates only on general considerations and priors , and avoid completely free adjustable parameters .",
    "however , in view of the large uncertainties in the values of the priors , the good agreement between the expected and the observed neutrino flux by icecube can not be used to draw firm conclusions beyond the statement that they are compatible . obviously , much larger statistics are needed to test conclusively whether the diffuse background of vhe neutrinos is a sum of a galactic non - isotropic background with a spectrum @xmath117 and intensity proportional to the galactic column density in their arrival direction , plus an isotropic extragalctic background with a harder spectrum @xmath118 .",
