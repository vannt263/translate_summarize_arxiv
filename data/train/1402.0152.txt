    "this is a continuation of our previous work @xcite on crystal bases for quantum ortho - symplectic superalgebras . in @xcite",
    ", we constructed a semisimple tensor category @xmath0 of modules over an quantum superalgebra @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an ortho - symplectic lie superalgebra of type @xmath1 or @xmath7 .",
    "this category is characterized by remarkably simple conditions similar to those for the polynomial @xmath8-modules ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , while its irreducible modules are @xmath9-deformations of infinite - dimensional @xmath6-modules appearing in a tensor power of a fock space , which were studied in @xcite via howe duality .",
    "its semisimplicity is based on the fact that @xmath0 naturally corresponds to the semisimple tensor category @xmath10 of finitely dominated integrable modules over a quantum enveloping algebra of the corresponding classical lie ( super)algebra @xmath11 from a viewpoint of super duality @xcite ( more precisely , they are equivalent when @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .    motivated by the work on crystal bases of polynomial @xmath8-modules @xcite , we classified the irreducible modules in @xmath0 when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and then proved the existence and uniqueness of their crystal bases , where the associated crystal is realized in terms of a new combinatorial object called ortho - symplectic tableaux of type @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .    in this paper , we establish the same result for @xmath16 ( theorem [ existence of crystal base ] ) . the strategy for the case",
    "@xmath17 is parallel to that of @xcite .",
    "but the main ingredient of our proof different from @xcite is to formulate the notion of an ortho - symplectic tableau of type @xmath4 ( definitions [ definition of t_a(a ) ] , [ admissible ] , and [ def : osptableaux ] ) , where more technical difficulty enters compared to type @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "an ortho - symplectic tableau of type @xmath4 is a sequence of two - column shaped skew tableaux of type @xmath18 with certain admissibility conditions on adjacent pairs similar to @xcite .",
    "then the crystal of an irreducible highest weight @xmath19-module in @xmath0 is realized as the set of ortho - symplectic tableaux of type @xmath4 associated to its highest weight , where the underlying tableaux of type @xmath18 are semistandard tableaux for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when we replace the underlying tableaux of type @xmath18 with usual semistandard tableaux for @xmath21 ( by putting @xmath22 ) , we obtain a new realization of crystals of integrable highest weight @xmath23-modules in @xmath24 ( type @xmath25 ) ( theorems [ crystal invariance of osp tableaux ] and [ character formula for m+n ] ) , which plays a crucial role in this paper .",
    "we remark that the tableaux models for type @xmath26 introduced in this paper and @xcite is based on the fock space model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , while the well - known kashiwara - nakashima tableaux ( for non - spinor highest weights ) @xcite are based on the crystals of natural representation and its tensor powers .",
    "we expect that our new combinatorial model for classical crystals is of independent interest and can be used for other interesting applications in the future .    finally , combining with the results in @xcite for type @xmath18 and @xcite for type @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "we conclude that the super duality , when restricted to the integrable modules over the classical lie algebras , provides a natural semisimple tensor category for lie superalgebras of types @xmath27 , where a crystal base theory exists .",
    "we expect that this can be extended to a more general class of contragredient lie superalgebras with isotropic simple roots , which includes simple finite - dimensional lie superalgebras of exceptional types @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , and whose super duality has been established in @xcite recently .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly recall the notations and results in @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we introduce our main combinatorial object called ortho - symplectic tableaux of type @xmath4 . then in section 4 , we prove that the set of ortho - symplectic tableaux associated to a given highest weight gives the character of the corresponding irreducible highest weight module over the lie superalgebra @xmath32 . in section 5 ,",
    "we classify the irreducible @xmath33-modules in @xmath0 , and prove the existence and uniqueness of their crystal bases , where the crystals are realized in terms of ortho - symplectic tableaux of type @xmath4 . in section 6 , we give a proof of theorem [ crystal invariance of osp tableaux ] , which is a main result in section 4 .",
