    "here , we provide details of the semidefinite program ( sdp ) alluded to in the main text . in  @xcite , it was shown that a certain matrix of expectation values @xmath43 containing experimentally accessible quantities @xmath9 can be seen as the result of a local completely - positive map @xmath44 acting on the underlying quantum state @xmath45 .",
    "since _ no _ local mapping can increase entanglement depth ( i.e. , it can not make a @xmath0-producible @xmath45 not @xmath0-producible ) , if @xmath43 is not @xmath0-producible , so is the underlying state @xmath45 . in other words , certifying that @xmath43 is not @xmath0-producible also certifies that the quantum state that gives rise to the correlation @xmath9 must have an entanglement depth of at least @xmath46 . to this end , let us remind that if a quantum state is separable with respect to a certain partitioning of the system into subsystems , the corresponding partial transposition(s )  @xcite of the quantum state must remain positive semidefinite .",
    "these observations together then allow us to ( 1 ) upper - bound the maximal possible quantum violation of _ any _ given ( linear ) bell inequality by @xmath0-producible quantum states , and ( 2 ) certify ( through the relaxation of partial transposition mentioned above ) that some given correlation @xmath9 does not originate from @xmath0-producible quantum states .",
    "recall from  @xcite that at any given level ( say , @xmath47 ) of the hierarchy considered therein , we consider a matrix @xmath48 $ ] that can be decomposed as : @xmath49=\\sum_{\\vec{a},\\vec{x } } p(\\vec{a}|\\vec{x})\\,f^\\ell_{\\vec{a},\\vec{x } } + \\sum_v u_v f^\\ell_v,\\ ] ] i.e. , into one fixed part that linearly depends on the experimentally accessible quantities @xmath9 , and a complementary ( orthogonal ) part that is known only if the underlying state @xmath45 and the measurement giving rise to the correlation @xmath9 is known ; in eq .",
    ", @xmath50 and @xmath51 are some fixed , symmetric , boolean matrices  @xcite .    for any _ given _ partition @xmath52 of the @xmath2 parties into subsets of @xmath53 groups satisfying eq .   and for any given bell inequality specified by @xmath54 , the @xmath47-level upper bound that we desire can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem : @xmath55\\ge 0 , \\quad \\chi_\\ell^{\\mbox{\\tiny t$_j$}}\\ge0\\quad\\forall\\ , j\\in{\\rm com}(\\mathcal{p})\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 refers to the set of all groupings of parties that are compatible with @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "for example , when @xmath57 and @xmath58 , a possible partition of 7 parties is given by @xmath59 , i.e. , the first 3 parties are entangled , and the same applies for the next 3 . in this case , the constraints in eq .   would include the requirement that the partial transpositions @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are positive semidefinite . since the optimization problem given in eq .",
    "only involves matrix positivity constraints and the objective function is linear in the matrix entries , it is thus an sdp .",
    "the desired upper bound is then obtained by taking the maximum of all such upper bounds ( returned by the sdps ) when considering all different partitions consistent with the assumption of eq .  .",
    "for any given correlation @xmath63 , determining its compatibility with @xmath0-producible states can be achieved , instead , by solving the following sdp : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the set of all possible partitions of @xmath2 parties that are consistent with eq .  .",
    "consider the bell expression : @xmath68 denote by @xmath69 and @xmath70 the maximal possible quantum value of @xmath71 achievable by , respectively , @xmath2-partite quantum states in general and those which are @xmath0-producible . here , we give a proof that for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , which generalizes theorem  [ thm : main ] ( corresponding to to the case of @xmath74 ) to a one - parameter family of bell expressions .",
    "essentially , this follows from the fact that in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dslice ] , @xmath71 with @xmath75 corresponds to a steeper hyperplane compared to what we have already established for @xmath74 . and intuitively , with a steeper objective function , the maximizer can not move to the right , thus allowing us to conclude with the help of lemma  [ lemma : max ] .    to this end",
    ", we shall first prove a lemma that allows us to relate the maximizer(s ) of @xmath70 for different values of @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be a bounded , real - valued function defined on some subset of @xmath78 .",
    "consider now the function @xmath79 and let @xmath80 be a maximizer of @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 is a global maximum of @xmath81 , then the following lemma relates the maximizers for different values of @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath80 gives rise to a global maximum of @xmath87 , we have that for all @xmath88 in the domain of @xmath89 , @xmath90 then for @xmath85 and @xmath84 @xmath91 where the first inequality follows from the assumptions that @xmath92 and @xmath85 and the second follows eq .  .",
    "the above lemma then allows us to show that the diwed that we provided in eq .",
    "is actually a special case of the more general family of witnesses : @xmath93 where @xmath72 . in the notations of appendix  [ app : proofub ]",
    ", proving inequality   amounts to proving : @xmath94 under the assumption of eq .  .",
    "recall from the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] that for any given @xmath95 , the maximizer(s ) of @xmath96 occur at @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "now , consider @xmath98 , lemma  [ lem : totheleft ] implies that the global maximizer of @xmath99 also occur at @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "an immediate application of lemma  [ lemma : max ] then allows us to conclude eq .  , which in turn implies @xmath73 and hence inequality  .",

    "<S> a brief comparison is made between our witnesses and those based on some other bell inequalities , as well as the quantum fisher information . </S>",
    "<S> a family of witnesses for genuine @xmath0-partite nonlocality applicable to an arbitrary @xmath1-partite scenario based on our bell inequalities is also presented .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important no - go theorems in physics concerns the impossibility to reproduce all quantum mechanical predictions using _ any _ locally - causal theory  @xcite  a fact commonly referred to as bell s theorem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important observation leading to this celebrated result is that measurement statistics allowed by such theories must satisfy constraints in the form of an inequality , a _ bell inequality_. since these inequalities only involve experimentally accessible quantities , their violation  a manifestation of bell - nonlocality  @xcite  can be , and has been ( modulo some arguably implausible loopholes  @xcite ) empirically demonstrated ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    clearly , bell inequalities played an instrumental role in the aforementioned discovery . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , they also find applications in numerous quantum information and communication tasks , e.g. , in quantum key distribution involving untrusted devices  @xcite , in the reduction of communication complexity  @xcite , in the expansion of trusted random numbers  @xcite , in certifying the hilbert space dimension of physical systems  @xcite , in self - testing  @xcite of quantum devices , in witnessing  @xcite and quantifying  @xcite ( multipartite ) quantum entanglement using untrusted devices etc . </S>",
    "<S> for a recent review on these and other applications , see  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> identifying interesting or useful bell inequalities is nonetheless by no means obvious . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the approach of solving for the complete set of optimal , i.e. , _ facet - defining _ bell inequalities for a given experimental scenario  though potentially useful for the identification of non - bell - local ( hereafter nonlocal ) correlations  typically produces a large number of inequalities with no apparent structure ( see however  @xcite for some progress made on classifying bell inequalities ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , carefully constructed bell inequalities , such as the _ families _ of two - party bell inequalities considered in  @xcite , have enabled us to conclude that certain correlations derived from maximally entangled states do not admit any _ local content _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and that the prediction of quantum theory can not be refined even when supplemented with hidden variables satisfying certain auxiliary assumptions  @xcite .    going beyond the bipartite scenario , the family of mermin - ardehali - belinskii - klyshko ( mabk ) inequalities  @xcite is a prominent example of interesting family of bell inequalities , giving clear evidence that a macroscopic number of physical systems can still give rise to strongly nonclassical behavior ( see also  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a sufficiently strong violation of the @xmath2-partite mabk inequalities can also be used to certify the presence of genuine @xmath2-partite entanglement in a _ device - independent _ manner , i.e. , without relying on any assumption about the measurement device nor the dimension of the hilbert space of the test systems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    what about the possibility of identifying genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement in an @xmath2-partite scenario with @xmath3 ? </S>",
    "<S> this is the question of _ entanglement depth _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , or equivalently non-@xmath0-producibility  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , which both seek to identify the extent to which many - body entanglement is present in a multipartite quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that genuine many - body entanglement is known to be essential , e.g. , in achieving extreme spin squeezing  @xcite , and also high sensitivity in some general metrology tasks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for well - calibrated or trusted  @xcite measurement devices , there exist few criteria  @xcite to certify such many - body entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> for example , an entanglement depth larger than 28 was recently demonstrated  @xcite using such a witness . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of certifying  in a _ device - independent _ manner  genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement in an arbitrary @xmath4-partite scenario has remained elusive so far .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we show that such robust certification in a scenario involving arbitrarily many parties is indeed possible  using a novel family of @xmath2-partite bell inequalities , and the characterized quantum violation of these inequalities by quantum states assuming only @xmath0-partite entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that , together with the appropriate bounds , these inequalities can also be used to witness genuine @xmath0-partite nonlocality  @xcite in an arbitrary @xmath2-partite scenario ( with @xmath1 ) . since genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement is a prerequisite for the presence of genuine @xmath0-partite quantum nonlocality  @xcite , witnesses for such multipartite nonlocality are also witnesses for entanglement depth </S>",
    "<S> let us stress , however , that our family of device - independent witnesses for entanglement depth _ do not _ rely on the detection of such genuine multipartite nonlocality .    _ a novel family of @xmath2-partite bell inequalities_.- consider a bell - type experiment involving @xmath2 spatially - separated parties ( labeled by @xmath5 ) , each of them performing two binary - outcome measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the measurement setting of the @xmath6-th party by @xmath7 , and the corresponding measurement outcome by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between these measurement outcomes can be summarized succinctly using the collection of joint conditional probability distributions @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , @xmath2-component vectors describing the combination of measurement outcomes and measurement settings . in terms of the @xmath2-partite full correlators @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> our family of @xmath2-partite bell inequalities @xmath13 reads as : @xmath14-e_n(\\vec{1}_n)\\ ,   \\stackrel{\\mbox{\\tiny $ { \\mathcal{l}}$}}{\\le } 1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is an @xmath2-bit string of ones and @xmath16 signifies that the inequality holds for a locally - causal theory . for @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> inequality   is the clauser - horne - shimony - holt bell inequality  @xcite ; for @xmath18 , it is equivalent to the 7-th tripartite inequality of  @xcite . for general @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> we show in appendix  [ app : facet ] that @xmath13 defines a facet  @xcite of the @xmath2-partite _ full - correlation _ </S>",
    "<S> polytope characterized by werner - wolf - ukowski - brukner  @xcite , thus being a member of the @xmath19 bell inequalities discovered therein . for @xmath20 , we can further verify numerically that @xmath13 corresponds to a facet of the polytope of locally - causal correlations  a property which we conjecture to hold true for general @xmath2 .    from  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it thus follows that the _ maximal quantum violation _ of @xmath13  denoted by @xmath21  is attainable if each party measures the @xmath22-outcome observables  @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 for some judiciously chosen @xmath25 , @xmath26 $ ] on the @xmath2-partite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state  @xcite @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath20 , we certified using a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programs  @xcite that @xmath21 can be achieved by further setting @xmath28 and @xmath29 for some @xmath30 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , this ansatz gives the quantum value    [ eq : quantummaximum ] @xmath31 where the explicit analytic values of @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) leading to @xmath21 can be found in appendix  [ app : phic ] ( see table  [ tbl : quantummax ] for the corresponding value of @xmath21 ) . for larger values of @xmath2 , the above observation and </S>",
