    "a neutron star core , at densities near and just above the normal nuclear density @xmath0 @xmath1 , consists of uniform nuclear matter being electrically neutral and roughly in @xmath2 equilibrium between its components such as neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons . for still higher densities , it is possible that various forms of matter including hyperons , meson ( pion or kaon ) condensates , quark matter droplets , and/or quark - gluon plasmas might become energetically favorable ; their presence is predicted to play an important role in determining the structure and evolution of neutron stars [ 1 ] . basically , these forms are thought to occur via pressure - induced phase transitions , whose nature , both static and dynamical , is still uncertain in the absence of adequate information about the properties of matter in the core such as the mutual interactions between its possible constituents and the equation of state .",
    "the possible existence of quark matter in neutron stars started to be considered about two decades ago mainly by comparing the energies of hadronic and quark matter at zero temperature [ 2 ] . using a separate physical description of the two phases , the transition from uniform hadronic matter to uniform quark matter , which proceeds suddenly at constant pressure ,",
    "was expected to occur in the density range @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the presence of uniform quark matter would enhance neutrino luminosity and neutron star cooling via quark urca processes [ 3 ] as well as soften the equation of state effectively [ 4 ] .",
    "however , the transition in the @xmath2-equilibrated matter , which contains two conserved charges , i.e. , electric charge and baryon number , should proceed through a mixed phase persisting over a finite range of pressure , as predicted by glendenning [ 5 ] according to gibbs criteria for phase equilibrium . in the low pressure regime of the mixed phase , as asserted by glendenning [ 5 ] and heiselberg @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    ", quark matter droplets form a coulomb lattice embedded in a sea of hadrons and in a roughly uniform sea of electrons and muons .",
    "this spatial structure can arise because the presence of strange and down quarks in the negatively charged quark phase plays a role in decreasing the electron and muon fermi energies and in increasing the proton fraction in the positively charged hadronic phase . with increasing pressure , the shape of quark matter changes from spheres to rods and then to plates , until the part of quark matter and that of hadronic matter begin to be replaced by each other .",
    "after further changes of the shape of hadronic matter from plates to rods and then to spheres , the system turns into uniform quark matter at the highest pressure .",
    "such structure of one- to three - dimensional periodicity , which has a characteristic length @xmath7 fm , would contribute not only to quake phenomena , possibly relevant to pulsar glitches , via its elastic properties [ 7 ] , but also to enhanced neutron star cooling due to opening of the quark phase space for neutrino - generating processes that are inhibited in a translationally invariant system [ 8 ] .",
    "this sequence of geometrical structure comes from the competition between the surface and coulomb energies , indicating that these structural transitions are of first order .",
    "the mechanism of quark - hadron phase transitions at nonzero densities , however , has not yet been established by full qcd calculations , e.g. , by monte carlo calculations of lattice gauge theory .",
    "kinetics of the quark - hadron phase transitions has been studied primarily in the context of the early universe and ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions [ 9 ] .",
    "the astrophysical situation in which such kinetics could be significant is compression of dense stellar matter during collapse of a massive star s core , spin - down of a neutron star , or mass accretion onto a neutron star from a companion star .",
    "the deconfinement transition in hadronic matter not containing strangeness , if proceeding via homogeneous nucleation [ 10 ] , begins with appearance of a critical - size droplet of two - flavor ( up and down ) quark matter induced by fluctuations . since a precritical droplet moves back and forth on a time scale for strong interactions , @xmath8 s , which is many orders of magnitude smaller than that for weak interactions ,",
    "flavor must be conserved during the precritical situation . as a consequence ,",
    "a critical droplet of three - flavor quark matter containing strange quarks is unlikely to occur in spite of its stability over two - flavor quark matter .",
    "it is expected that a critical droplet of up and down quark matter appears either via thermal activation of the energy barrier separating the initial metastable ( hadronic ) phase from the stable ( quark ) phase in configuration space at high temperatures typical of matter created in highly energetic heavy - ion collisions and in stellar collapse , or via quantum penetration of this barrier at low temperatures appropriate to neutron star cores .",
    "we also note that during the growth of the critical droplet , weak processes producing strange quarks proceed fully in the stellar interiors in contrast to the case of heavy - ion collisions .    in our recent papers [ 11,12 ] , the time required to form a two - flavor quark matter droplet in a neutron star core , originally composed of nuclear matter in @xmath2 equilibrium ,",
    "was calculated for pressures near the point of the static deconfinement transition by using a quantum tunneling analysis incorporating the electrostatic energy and the effects of energy dissipation .",
    "it was found that the dissipation effects , governed by collisions of low - energy excitations in the hadronic phase with the droplet surface , significantly increase the degree of overpressure needed to form a droplet in the star , and that the formed droplet develops into bulk matter due to the screening of leptons on the droplet charge .",
    "we also discovered that the nucleation is likely to proceed via quantum tunneling rather than via thermal activation at temperatures below @xmath9 mev typical of neutron star matter .",
    "it is of interest to note that strangeness may be present in the hadronic phase in the form of hyperons ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc . )",
    "[ 13,14 ] or in the form of a kaon condensate [ 15 ] .",
    "the presence of strange quarks in hyperons or kaons , altering not only the equation of state and the composition before and after deconfinement but also the quark - hadron interfacial energy , may affect the nature of the formation and growth of a quark matter droplet .",
    "a new physics content that we consider in this paper is the influence of the presence of hyperons on the dynamical deconfinement transition that may occur in the hadronic core of a neutron star accreting matter from a companion or rotating down .",
    "we particularly evaluate at what pressure a quark matter droplet forms via quantum tunneling in the metastable phase of hadronic matter containing hyperons ( hereafter referred to as hyperonic matter ) . for this purpose ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of hyperonic matter such as the equation of state and the composition are estimated from a relativistic mean - field theory ; we use the one with the parameters incorporating a binding energy of @xmath10 in saturated nuclear matter [ 16 ] . by using an mit bag model for the thermodynamic properties of quark matter",
    ", we calculate not only the pressure at which a deconfinement transition from hyperonic matter in @xmath2 equilibrium takes place statically subject to flavor conservation , but also the corresponding jump of baryon density . in the overpressure regime , the time needed to form a quark matter droplet is obtained using a theory of quantum nucleation developed by lifshitz and kagan [ 17 ] ; we build into this theory the effects of coulomb energy , special relativity , energy dissipation [ 18 ] , and dynamical [ 19 ] and static compressibility .",
    "some of these effects are found to be crucial for the formation and growth of a quark matter droplet .",
    "we then estimate the critical overpressure required to form the first quark matter droplet in a neutron star core that consists of @xmath2-stable hyperonic matter being compressed during a time scale for the spin - down or accretion . the resulting crossover temperature from the quantum tunneling to the thermal activation regime",
    "is shown to be large compared with the typical temperatures of matter in the core . by comparing the obtained critical pressure with the central pressure of the star with maximum mass",
    ", we evaluate the range of the bag - model parameters , i.e. , the bag constant , the qcd fine structure constant , and the strange quark mass , where quark matter is expected to occur via deconfinement in the star .    in sec .",

    "ii , the time needed to form a quark matter droplet in the metastable phase of nuclear or hyperonic matter is calculated in the overpressure regime ; the critical overpressure and the quantum - thermal crossover temperature are also estimated allowing for the stellar conditions .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v. in the appendix , the quark distributions inside a droplet are considered .",
    "in this section we first summarize a theory of quantum nucleation of a stable phase in a low - temperature first - order phase transition as advanced by lifshitz and kagan [ 17 ] .",
    "we then extend this theory to a relativistic regime where the effective mass of a critical - size droplet of the stable phase is comparable to the height of a potential barrier .",
    "effects of energy dissipation [ 18 ] and dynamical compressibility [ 19 ] in the metastable phase , ignored above , are also built into the formalism to calculate the rate of quantum nucleation of the new phase .",
    "we assume in this section that the stable and metastable phases are electrically neutral quantum liquids with a single component .",
    "quantum tunneling nucleation of a stable phase in a first - order phase transition was first investigated by lifshitz and kagan [ 17 ] .",
    "their analysis gives us a basic tool for evaluating the time needed to form a real droplet of the stable phase at low temperatures and at pressures in the vicinity of the phase equilibrium pressure . at such pressures ,",
    "a nucleated droplet contains a large number of particles so that the resulting energy gain can compensate for the sharp energy increase in the interfacial layer .",
    "one may thus consider a droplet being in a virtual or real state to be a sphere macroscopically characterized by its radius @xmath13 and describe the tunneling behavior of a virtual droplet in the semiclassical approximation . by assuming that the velocity of sound @xmath14 is sufficiently large compared with the velocity of the phase boundary , i.e.",

    "the height @xmath23 of this barrier is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the kinetic energy for a fluctuation of @xmath15 is also necessary for the determination of the quantum nucleation rate . during such a fluctuation",
    ", the density discontinuity between the stable and metastable phases induces a hydrodynamic mass flow in the medium around the droplet .",

    "the higher order effect of relativity acts to raise the energy level and hence to enhance the tunneling probability , as will be clarified in sec .",
    "so far it was assumed that the system adjusts adiabatically to the fluctuation of @xmath15 , i.e. , a virtual droplet of the stable phase fluctuates in a reversible way . in a realistic situation , however , relaxation processes involved proceed at a finite rate ; the density adjustment with varying @xmath15 is necessarily accompanied by appearance of excitations in the metastable phase .",
    "these excitations give rise to dissipation of the total energy of the droplet until the system reaches a complete thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "if the mean free path @xmath75 of the excitations is much smaller than @xmath15 , the excitations play a role in viscous transport of momentum from the high to the low velocity region with the rate of energy dissipation , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the viscosity of the metastable phase and @xmath25 is given by eq .",

    "they collide with the droplet surface and eventually relax in the medium far away from the droplet .",

    "it is noteworthy that around the peak where the effective mass @xmath51 of the critical droplet is comparable to or smaller than the barrier height @xmath23 , the effect of relativity on the quantum nucleation becomes prominent .",
    "we have examined the question of how the presence of hyperons in cold dense hadronic matter affects the dynamical properties of the first - order deconfinement transition that may occur in neutron stars . for this purpose",
    ", we have used the bag - model description of quark matter and the relativistic - mean - field description of hadronic matter .",
    "the time needed to form a quark matter droplet has been then calculated by using the quantum - tunneling nucleation theory which allows for the electrostatic energy and the effects of relativity , energy dissipation , and finite compressibility .    in the calculations ignoring the presence of hyperons , we have found that the effective mass of a virtual droplet moving under the potential barrier is sufficiently large to keep its growth rate fairly small compared with the fermi velocity averaged over nucleon species .",
    "this results in an eminent property of the quantum - tunneling formation of a real droplet : the quantum tunneling is controlled by the dissipative processes , in which the nucleon quasiparticles moving ballistically collide with the droplet surface , rather than by the reversible underbarrier motion of a droplet being in a coherent state . we have likewise found that inside a droplet of relatively small radius , an appreciable electric charge arises from the pressure equilibrium between quarks and nucleons immersed in a roughly uniform sea of electrons and muons . with increase in the droplet radius , the degenerate gas of electrons and muons becomes effective at screening the droplet charge , and at last prevents the coulomb potential barrier from forming .",
    "this result indicates that a real droplet , if appearing , would develop into bulk matter .",
    "we note that these conclusions are consistent with the results of refs .",
    "[ 11 ] and [ 12 ] obtained using a specific set of the bag - model parameters and a rather simplified model for nuclear matter .",
    "the estimates allowing for the presence of hyperons have shown that the density discontinuity at deconfinement and the lepton fraction in the hadronic phase fall in magnitude considerably from the values obtained ignoring the presence of hyperons .",
    "the resulting lepton fraction is small enough for the droplet charge to be nearly zero , allowing us to assume the charge neutrality everywhere in the system .",
    "the decrease in the effective droplet mass due to the lessened density discontinuity , when sufficient , drives the droplet to move relativistically under the potential barrier .",
    "not only does such a droplet motion cause the decelerating effect of energy dissipation on the droplet formation to decline , but also necessitates the relativistic treatment of the quantum nucleation theory .",
    "a natural extension to the relativistic regime has been made , leading to an exponential increment in the tunneling probability .",
    "irrespective of whether hyperons exist or not , the finite compressibility of the hadronic phase is unlikely to have consequence in decreasing the kinetic energy of a droplet via sound emission at low temperatures relevant to neutron star cores .",
    "such temperatures have been found to be small compared with the temperature at which an abrupt transition from the quantum - tunneling to the thermal - activation nucleation takes place at a typical overpressure .",
    "we have lastly investigated the range of the parameters @xmath222 and @xmath210 where quark matter may appear in the core of a neutron star during the compression of hadronic matter due to the stellar spin - down or accretion .",
    "it has been shown in the analysis of the static deconfinement transition that for the adopted models for bulk hadronic matter and quark matter , the existence of hyperons and the finiteness of @xmath227 ( @xmath479 mev ) do not greatly alter the favorable parameter range for the appearance of quark matter in the star .",
    "we have also found from the dynamical properties of the deconfinement transition that the critical overpressure @xmath469 required to form the first droplet in the star narrows the favorable parameter range obtained from the static properties into the lower @xmath222 and lower @xmath210 regime .",
    "the critical overpressure @xmath469 , however , is quite uncertain , because it depends on the poorly known quark - hadron interfacial properties and the unclear interactions of quasiparticles in the medium with the droplet surface . in order to make a further investigation",
    ", we should take account of the possible effect of nucleon superfluidity , which acts to decrease the number of available quasiparticle states with momenta close to the fermi surfaces [ 12 ] .",
    "if the nucleons were in a superfluid state , the friction force exerted by the quasiparticles on the droplet and hence the critical overpressure @xmath469 in the system not containing hyperons would be reduced considerably .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the obtained results for the deconfinement transition are based on the adopted models for hadronic matter and for quark matter , which are inequivalent physical descriptions of the two phases and hence do not necessarily describe the transition well .",
    "granted that such models hold good , the dynamical properties of the transition are not obvious quantitatively as mentioned in the preceding paragraph . moreover , the mechanical or chemical impurities leading to the formation of a quark matter seed , if occurring in the star at all , might relax the condition for the transition drastically .",
    "once the first droplet of quark matter arises from fluctuations in a neutron star , its growth into bulk matter would cause strange matter to occupy the central region of the star as long as the strange matter is more favorable than @xmath2-equilibrated hadronic matter .",
    "these two phases , if both are present , would have a charged but overall neutral layer which spreads from the quark - hadron boundary on each side over a length scale determined by the thomas - fermi screening length . at the boundary",
    ", they not only would have the same chemical potential of leptons , but also would be in equilibrium with respect to @xmath2 and deconfinement processes . even if the quark - hadron mixed phase is the lowest energy configuration at pressures around the boundary ,",

    "first , the effective droplet mass @xmath31 , estimated from the nucleon kinetic energy as eq .  ( 85 ) , is increased , since it is proportional to the square of the baryon density discontinuity at @xmath527 . such increase in @xmath31 diminishes the typical velocity of the precritical droplet , enforcing its smallness relative to the averaged fermi velocity @xmath381 given by eq .  (",
    "on the other hand , the hydrodynamic mass flow of each quark component , which arises from the coulomb - induced inhomogeneity in @xmath484 , contributes little to @xmath31 .",
    "second , the friction force @xmath528 given by eq .  ( 87 ) , behaving as @xmath529 , likewise becomes strong owing to @xmath484 .",
    "a further friction force arises from the collisions of quark quasiparticles , carrying the quark mass flow , with the droplet surface , but this is negligibly small compared with the nucleon contribution .",
    "recall that the baryon density discontinuity at @xmath527 is fairly large , ranging @xmath3630.7 @xmath1 , in the absence of the quark screening .",
    "we may then conclude that the shifts @xmath484 , acting to enhance the dissipation effects governed by nucleon quasiparticles , lead to a fractional increase in the critical overpressure @xmath469 .",
    "we conclude this appendix by briefly mentioning the influence of the static compressibility of quark matter , surrounded by hadronic matter with hyperons , on the potential energy .",
    "this effect can easily be estimated by following a line of argument analogous to the case in which no hyperons exist and by neglecting the electrostatic properties .",
    "such an estimate made over the considered range of the parameters such as @xmath222 , @xmath210 , @xmath20 , and @xmath227 demonstrates that the finite compressibility increases the number densities @xmath318 , @xmath319 , and @xmath406 , independently of @xmath15 , by less than about 10% at typical overpressures .",
    "this leads to a chemically induced decrease in the quark energy , which has been found to be of little consequence to the potential energy .",
    "the resulting increase in the baryon density inside a droplet by typically @xmath530 @xmath1 shifts the baryon kinetic energy appreciably , and hence the effective droplet mass ( 95 ) .",
    "this is because , in the absence of the quark screening , the baryon density discontinuity at @xmath527 is relatively small , ranging @xmath5310.3 @xmath1 .",
    "such shifts move into the lower-@xmath222 regime the region of the bag - model parameters in which the droplet behaves relativistically , but otherwise do not change the qualitative conclusions about the nucleation processes obtained ignoring the quark screening .",
