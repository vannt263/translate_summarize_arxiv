    "many important results have been reported over the past years about laser - driven plasma accelerators  @xcite , however one of the questions that remain unanswered is that of the acceleration of an electron beam in the few tens mev range externally injected . at such energies ,",
    "the electron beam will be spread over several dizains of femtoseconds after few meters of drift space .",
    "such duration is comparable to the typical period of plasma oscillations for a plasma with density of the order of .",
    "this can be a limitation for external injection experiments as the electrons arriving at the wrong phase will not be captured and accelerated .",
    "one solution to mitigate that effect is to compress the electrons in time before accelerating them .",
    "this compression followed by acceleration is one of the main iters that we plan to investigate in our experiment .",
    "a high power laser pulse sent in a low density hydrogen or helium gas can ionise it and create a wake characterized by strong electric and magnetic fields .",
    "if the pulse is not too intense ( @xmath0 ) , then the plasma will be weakly driven by the laser pulse , this is called the linear regime  @xcite . in such conditions we can use or define the following quantities :    * maximum accelerating field @xmath1 hence + @xmath2= 96.2 \\sqrt{n_e [ \\si{e18}{cm^{-3}}]}\\ ] ] .",
    "* longitudinal accelerating field + @xmath3 .",
    "* radial accelerating field + @xmath4    with @xmath5 the electron mass , @xmath6 the electron charge , @xmath7 the laser wavelength ( ) , @xmath8 the plasma density , @xmath9 the plasma wavelength ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 the plasma wave number , @xmath12 the laser - plasma coupling @xmath13 the plasma relativistic limit , @xmath14 the laser distance behind the pulse , @xmath15 the radial distance and @xmath16 the laser waist radius at position @xmath17 ( and @xmath18 at @xmath19 , the focal point ) .    therefore a pressure of will give a maximum longitudinal accelerating field of more than .",
    "this corresponds to a plasma wavelength of about ( that is about ) .",
    "it is important to note also that the radial accelerating field can take either positive or a negative value , that is , it can be either focussing or defocussing .",
    "with a laser focused on a waist we get a rayleigh length of about 1 cm",
    ". this will give a sufficient length to compress and accelerate the electrons .",
    "these electrons must also be focussed in a comparable volume .",
    "the proposed experiment will be performed within the esculap ( _ electrons courts et lasers plasmas _ ) installation at lal , by combining the laserix laser  @xcite with the phil photoinjector  @xcite .",
    "phil is a conventional photoinjector that is currently being upgraded to .",
    "a layout of phil is shown on figure  [ phil ] .",
    "laserix is a 50 tw , 50  fs high - power ti : sa laser . as part of esculap a small leak from laserix",
    "will be directed on the phil photocathode to produce short electron pulses .",
    "laser - driven plasma acceleration experiment will be performed by injecting simulaneously the high energy laser beam with the phil generated relativistic electron beam into a few cm gas cell .",
    "for our simulations we have considered electrons with an energy of focussed on a low density @xmath20 plasma . at the entrance of the plasma the electrons have a transverse size of , they are covering with an half - angle of and the fwhm duration of the bunch is .",
    "the total length of the plasma cell considered is but the cell has been designed so that it has a varying pressure according to the profile shown on figure  [ fig : plasma_density ] .     is . ]",
    "the simultations were done using an adapted version of the numerical code wake - ep  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this special density profile is to achieve a radial and longitudinal compression of the electron bunch before its acceleration .",
    "the first part of the density profile ( decreasing pressure gradient ) will keep all the electron together in the focussing phase of the plasma wake .",
    "as the electrons have a relatively low @xmath21 the difference in accelerating gradient experienced between the head and the tail of the bunch will compress them all together .",
    "once this is achieved the second part of the density profile ( increasing pressure gradient ) will keep the bunch together at the back of the wave to accelerate them with the highest field .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]         [ fig : energy_dist ]    on figure  [ fig : simulations ] ( a ) one can see the distribution of the electrons ( in black ) and of the laser wake ( in blue ) at @xmath22 , the entrance of the plasma cell .",
    "we can see that at injection the electron bunch ( coming from a conventional accelerator simulated using astra  @xcite ) have a large time spread and a small energy spread .",
    "as they progress through the decreasing gradient ramp the trailing electrons will experience a higher accelerating field than the electrons at the front .",
    "as at these energy they are barely relativistic this difference will result in these electrons almost catching up with the leading one and the beam will get compressed in time .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ fig : simulations ] ( b - c ) .",
    "on figure  [ fig : simulations ] ( b ) one can see that the distance between the leading and trailing electrons has significantly reduced and the trailing electrons have now more energy than the leading ones . on figure",
    "[ fig : simulations ] ( c ) the trailing electrons are even overtaking the leading ones and the bunch is compressed in only a few micrometers .",
    "it is important to note that this compression completely erases the initial energy spread of the bunch and its time spread .",
    "once this process is over , after @xmath23 , the increase in plasma density and in laser intensity will significantly accelerate the electrons . on figure  [ fig : simulations ]",
    "( d ) one can see that at the end of the accelerating process the electrons reach a lorentz factor @xmath21 of about 500 with slightly more than 15% energy spread ( figure  [ fig : energy_dist ] ) .",
    "external injection of electrons with an energy of about in a low density plasma excited by a high power laser has the potential of bringing the energy of these electrons up .",
    "this will require the use of a specially designed plasma cell capable of providing a two gradient ramp over a few centimeters .",
