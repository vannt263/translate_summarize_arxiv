    "still , if a quantum point contact is inserted in a long sns junction ( @xmath43 ) , one might expect to find _ geometry - dependent _ quantum size effects on the josephson current .",
    "theoretical work on that structure was done by furusaki , takayanagi , and tsukada @xcite .",
    "their result is that @xmath31 increases stepwise with increasing width for certain shapes of the constriction , but not generically .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a brief discussion of a possible experimental realization of the superconducting quantum point contact .",
    "the present theory is based on two approximations : firstly , we assume adiabatic transport , i.e.  absence of scattering between the transverse modes ( or 1d subbands ) in the quantum point contact .",
    "the assumption of adiabaticity brings out the essential features of the effect in the simplest and most direct way , just as it does in the normal state @xcite . as in the normal state @xcite",
    ", we expect the discretization of the josephson current to be robust to deviations from adiabaticity which do not cause backscattering .",
    "in particular , although we assume both @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the present analysis , we believe that the condition @xmath44 on the mean free path is sufficient , since scattering in the wide regions outside the constriction is unlikely to cause backscattering into the constriction .    secondly , in order to further simplify the problem , we treat the propagation of the modes in the wkb approximation .",
    "the wkb approximation breaks down if the fermi energy @xmath46 lies within @xmath5 from the cutoff energy of a transverse mode ( being the 1d subband bottom ) .",
    "we can therefore only describe the plateau region of the discretized josephson current , not the transition from one multiple of @xmath47 to the next .",
    "since the transition region is smaller than the plateau region by a factor of order @xmath48 ( where @xmath2 is the number of occupied subbands in the constriction ) , it is relatively unimportant if @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the theory of kulik and omelyanchuk @xcite on the josephson effect in a classical point contact is based on a classical boltzmann - type transport equation for the green s functions ( the eilenberger equation @xcite ) , which is not applicable to a quantum point contact .",
    "the present analysis is based on the fully quantum - mechanical bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for quasiparticle wavefunctions , into which the green s functions can be expanded @xcite . in the present section",
    "we describe how the josephson current can be obtained directly from the quasi - particle excitation spectrum  without having to calculate the green s functions .",
    "this method is particularly well suited for the point contact josephson junction , which has an excitation spectrum of a very simple form .",
    "the bdg equations consist of two schrdinger equations for electron and hole wavefunctions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , coupled by the pair potential @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the single - electron hamiltonian in the field of a vector potential @xmath56 and electrostatic potential @xmath57 .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath58 is measured relative to the fermi energy . since the matrix operator in eq .",
    "( [ bdg1 ] ) is hermitian , the eigenfunctions @xmath59 form a complete orthonormal set .",
    "one readily verifies that if @xmath60 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath58 , then @xmath61 is also an eigenfunction , with eigenvalue @xmath62 .",
    "the complete set of eigenvalues thus lies symmetrically around zero .",
    "the excitation spectrum consists of all positive @xmath58 .    in a uniform system with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , the solution of the bdg equations is @xmath66 the excitation spectrum is continuous , with excitation gap @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath60 are plane waves characterized by a wavevector @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficients of the plane waves are the two coherence factors of the bcs theory .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , the excitation spectrum acquires a discrete part in the presence of a josephson junction .",
    "the discrete spectrum corresponds to bound states in the gap ( @xmath68 ) , localized within @xmath33 from the junction .",
    "the josephson current turns out to be essentially determined by the discrete part of the excitation spectrum .",
    "close to the junction the pair potential is not uniform . to determine @xmath53 one has to solve the self - consistency equation @xcite @xmath69 , \\label{selfconsist } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all states with positive eigenvalue , , with @xmath70 the debije frequency , has to be introduced as usual in the bcs theory . ] and @xmath71^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function .",
    "the coefficient @xmath72 is minus the interaction constant of the bcs theory of superconductivity . at an sn interface , @xmath72 changes abruptly ( over atomic distances ) from a positive constant to zero .",
    "in contrast , the cooper pair density @xmath73 goes to zero only over macroscopic distances ( on the order of @xmath33 for a planar sn interface ) . because of eq .",
    "( [ selfconsist ] ) , the determination of the excitation energy spectrum is a non - linear problem , which is further complicated by the fact that the vector potential has also to be determined self - consistently from the current density , via maxwell s equations .",
    "( the electrostatic potential can usually be assumed to be the same as in the normal state . )",
    "once the eigenvalue problem ( [ bdg1 ] ) is solved self - consistently , one can calculate the equilibrium average of a single - electron operator @xmath74 by means of the formula ( cf .  ref .",

    "there is an alternative ( and often more convenient ) way to arrive at the total equilibrium current @xmath13 flowing through the josephson junction , which is to use the fundamental relation @xcite @xmath84 between the josephson current and the derivative of the free energy @xmath85 with respect to the phase difference .",
