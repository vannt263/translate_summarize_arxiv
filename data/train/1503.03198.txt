    "we begin by considering an immersed curve @xmath1 . the _ rotation number _",
    "@xmath2 is defined to be the ( signed ) number of turns made by the tangent vector as we travel along @xmath3 , or more formally the degree of @xmath3 s gauss map .",
    "the _ index _",
    "@xmath4 of a point @xmath5 with respect to @xmath3 is the ( signed ) number of times @xmath3 revolves around @xmath6 , or more formally the degree of the map @xmath7 given by @xmath8    the reader should beware that in some sources the rotation number is referred to as the index of the curve , and that the term `` winding number '' may be used to refer either to the index or the rotation number .",
    "it is a basic fact of differential geometry that @xmath3 s rotation number can be calculated by integrating its curvature and dividing by @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 this formula is referred to as hopf s umlaufsatz by lanzat and polyak in @xcite , although other sources , including the paper in which hopf introduced the term , @xcite , use `` umlaufsatz '' to refer to the more specific case where @xmath3 is a simple curve ( i.e. @xmath3 has no self - intersections ) , in which case @xmath11 in this sense equation ( [ hu - multiplicities ] ) can be seen as an `` umlaufsatz with multiplicities '' .",
    "later , when we consider curves in more general surfaces , we will see that we need a `` gauss - bonnet theorem with multiplicities '' in the same vein .",
    "while the rotation number can be calculated for any immersed curve in the plane and is invariant under all regular homotopies , arnold s invariants @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined only for _ generic _ curves in the plane  curves which have a finite number of transverse double points as their only self - intersections  and are invariant under regular homotopies within this narrower class .",
    "it is well - known that if two generic curves are regular homotopic in the space of immersed curves , then one can be transformed into the other by a series of homotopies in the space of generic curves together with a finite number of _ self - tangency _ and _ triple - point _ moves , shown in figure [ moves ] .",
    "self - tangency moves can be further classified into direct and opposite self - tangencies , according to whether the two involved arcs of the curve are pointing in the same direction or in opposite directions ( see figure [ st - classification ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 invariant can be understood as counting direct self - tangency moves : it increases by 2 under direct self - tangency moves and is unchanged under opposite self - tangency moves and triple - point moves .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath13 invariants play analogous roles for opposite self - tangency moves and triple - point moves , respectively @xcite .",
    "0.4    0.4    0.4    0.4    this characterization of @xmath15 determines it uniquely up to addition of a term depending only on the regular homotopy class of @xmath3 ( in the class of immersed curves ) .",
    "arnold specifies a value of @xmath0 on a standard representative of each homotopy class of @xmath3 , thereby specifying it exactly @xcite .",
    "lanzat and polyak s polynomial invariant in @xcite is likewise defined for generic curves in the plane .",
    "for such a @xmath3 , they extend @xmath16 to a total function on @xmath17 by first noting that @xmath16 is locally constant on @xmath18 and then defining @xmath19 for @xmath20 to be the average of @xmath21 over the connected components of @xmath18 in a neighborhood of @xmath6 ( see figure [ index ] )",
    ". then lanzat and polyak s invariant @xmath22 $ ] is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the set of double points of @xmath3 , and for each @xmath25 , one defines @xmath26 as the unsigned angle between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    substituting @xmath29 into the polynomial immediately gives @xmath30 it is in this sense that lanzat and polyak s polynomial is considered to be a quantization or quantum deformation of the rotation number .",
    "lanzat and polyak show that their polynomial is invariant under regular homotopies in the space of generic curves .",
    "they calculate its value on representatives of the regular homotopy classes ( with respect to regular homotopies in the space of _ all _ immersed curves ) and how it changes under the different kinds of self - tangency and triple - point moves . from these results ,",
    "they easily show the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the linear term in the taylor expansion of @xmath33 at @xmath29 .",
    "from this relation and equation ( [ lp ] ) they obtain an integral expression for @xmath15 .",
    "both the rotation number and the @xmath0 invariant have been extended to curves in more general surfaces . for the rotation number , first note that the rotation number on the plane can be defined as the unique homomorphism from the group of regular homotopy classes of curves immersed in the plane to the group @xmath34 , subject to the constraint that a small counterclockwise loop should map to 1 . to determine a rotation number for a curve in a surface @xmath35 , we first need to specify a set of smooth generators of the fundamental group of @xmath35",
    "; then there is a unique homomorphism from the group of regular homotopy classes of curves in @xmath35 to @xmath36 , subject to the constraints that the representatives of the fundamental group map to 0 and that a small counterclockwise contractible loop maps to 1 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath37 is the euler characteristic of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is simply @xmath34 if @xmath37 is 0",
    ". the choice of generators does not affect the rotation number of homologically trivial curves , which will be the focus of most of the remainder of the paper .",
    "for our purposes , then , we can take the following as the definition of the rotation number : the _ rotation number _ for homologically trivial curves in a closed oriented surface @xmath35 is the unique homomorphism from the group of regular homotopy classes of homologically trivial curves in @xmath35 to @xmath36 , subject to the constraint that a small counterclockwise contractible loop maps to 1 .",
    "several generalizations of @xmath0 are given by viro in @xcite .",
    "most significantly for our purposes , he defines an invariant @xmath15 for generic homologically trivial curves immersed in oriented closed surfaces , which is unchanged by opposite self - tangency moves and triple - point moves , and which under direct self - tangency moves increases by 2 .",
    "actually viro generalizes the related invariant @xmath14 , which is unchanged by direct self - tangency moves and triple - point moves , and which decreases by 2 at opposite self - tangencies . as he points out , though",
    ", given such an invariant @xmath14 we can immediately define an invariant @xmath0 by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of double points of the curve .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath0 defined in this way is unchanged by opposite self - tangency moves and triple - point moves , and increases by 2 under direct self - tangency moves .",
    "viro s @xmath0 generalizes arnold s earlier construction of a @xmath0 invariant for curves on the sphere . to calculate @xmath40 , as arnold called it , stereographically project the sphere onto the plane , choosing some point in @xmath41 to be the point at infinity .",
    "then letting @xmath42 be the resulting curve in the plane , @xmath43 arnold showed that @xmath44 is independent of the point we choose as the point at infinity in the stereographic projection , and it clearly changes in the way that a @xmath0 invariant is required to under self - tangency and triple - point moves .",
    "in this paper we attempt to generalize lanzat and polyak s polynomial and related results to curves in surfaces , as far as is possible .",
    "we introduce a more general index function which makes sense in a general connected oriented surface , but the price for this generality is twofold : the new index function @xmath45 is defined not only in terms of @xmath3 but also a base point @xmath46 in the surface , and @xmath3 must be homologically trivial . using the @xmath45",
    "we construct a polynomial @xmath47 , which is defined by integrating local geometric data much as lanzat and polyak s polynomial is .",
    "we show that @xmath47 is independent of the riemannian metric on the surface .",
    "evaluating the polynomial at @xmath29 , we obtain a new integral formula for the rotation number , which is also a generalization of one form of the gauss - bonnet theorem . for surfaces with nonzero euler characteristic ,",
    "we show that @xmath15 can be calculated from the value and first derivative of @xmath47 at @xmath29 , thereby obtaining an integral formula for @xmath15 .",
    "lastly , we use this formula to give an explicit expression for @xmath44 .",
    "in a general surface , the concept of how many times a curve goes around a point is meaningless .",
    "note , however , that before extending its domain from @xmath18 to @xmath17 , @xmath21 is the unique function @xmath48 satisfying the following conditions :    a.   @xmath21 is locally constant .",
    "b.   @xmath21 increases by 1 when we make a positive crossing over @xmath3 . c.   @xmath49 for a point @xmath6 on the outside of @xmath3 .",
    "although the third condition has no meaning in a general surface , the first two can be considered in any oriented surface . for an oriented closed surface @xmath35 and a generic smooth curve @xmath50 , constructing an integer - valued function on @xmath18 satisfying the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) is equivalent to constructing a singular 2-chain with boundary @xmath3 .",
    "thus such a function can be constructed if and only if @xmath3 is homologically trivial . in this case , if @xmath35 is connected then the function is uniquely determined up to addition of a constant .",
    "this motivates the following definition : for an oriented connected surface @xmath35 , a homologically trivial generic curve @xmath50 , and a base point @xmath51 , let @xmath45 be the unique function @xmath52 satisfying the following conditions :    a.   @xmath45 is locally constant .",
    "b.   @xmath45 increases by 1 when we make a positive crossing over @xmath3 . c.   @xmath53 .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath54 is the intersection index of any path from @xmath46 to @xmath6 with @xmath3 , which can be taken as an alternative definition of @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the requirement that @xmath35 is connected ensures that such a path exists , and the requirement that @xmath3 is homologically trivial ensures that the intersection index does not depend on the path chosen .    as before ,",
    "we extend @xmath55 to all of @xmath35 by saying that for @xmath6 in the image of @xmath3 , @xmath56 is found by averaging @xmath55 over the connected components of @xmath57 in a neighborhood of @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath35 be an oriented connected closed surface with riemannian metric , let @xmath58 be a homologically trivial generic smooth curve on @xmath35 , and let @xmath51 . let @xmath59 be the set of double points of @xmath3 .",
    "for each double point @xmath60 , let @xmath61 be the unsigned angle between the tangent vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be the geodesic curvature of @xmath3 at @xmath64 , and let @xmath65 be the gaussian curvature . define @xmath66 as @xmath67    @xmath66 is preserved under orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "that is , @xmath66 does not depend on the riemannian metric on @xmath35 .    for @xmath68 ,",
    "let @xmath69 be the subsurface of @xmath35 where the index is greater than @xmath70 .",
    "observe that @xmath71 is a piecewise smooth curve whose pieces are the arcs of @xmath3 with index @xmath70 .",
    "the orientation which @xmath71 inherits from @xmath3 agrees with its orientation as the boundary of @xmath69 . for each @xmath72 let @xmath73 be the set of double points with degree @xmath74 . at each @xmath75 , @xmath71 changes direction by @xmath76 . at each @xmath75 , @xmath71 changes direction by @xmath77 . by the gauss - bonnet theorem , @xmath78 and so @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 in @xmath82 .",
    "applying the gauss - bonnet theorem to all of @xmath35 gives @xmath83 , so @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 thus @xmath87 none of the terms on the right of ( [ topological - formula ] ) depend on the riemannian metric , so @xmath47 is preserved under orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "although two of the terms on the right side of equation ( [ topological - formula ] ) diverge as @xmath88 , @xmath47 is a polynomial in @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( as is clear from its integral definition ) and is thus defined for all @xmath91 .",
    "it is not quite true that @xmath47 is invariant under regular homotopies of @xmath3 in the space of generic curves ; such a homotopy might change the position of @xmath3 relative to the base point @xmath46 .",
    "however , if we view @xmath3 together with the choice of base point as a generic immersion @xmath92 , it follows immediately from the theorem that @xmath93 is invariant under regular homotopies in the space of such generic immersions .",
    "for a new base point @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath55 differ by a constant .",
    "suppose @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99",
    "since lanzat and polyak s polynomial @xmath33 is a quantum deformation of the rotation number , a natural question is what @xmath47 is a quantum deformation of . calculating @xmath100 explicitly by substituting @xmath29 into the integral expression of @xmath47",
    ", we get @xmath101 in the special case where @xmath3 is the boundary of a disk @xmath102 and the base point @xmath46 is on the outside of @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 one form of the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "thus equation ( [ gb - multiplicities ] ) is a `` gauss - bonnet theorem with multiplicities '' in which @xmath3 may wrap around multiple times .",
    "but what exactly does @xmath100 measure ? by the above intuitive reasoning and by analogy with lanzat and polyak s results , we should hope that @xmath105 will coincide with the generalized definition of the rotation number .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case , as we will demonstrate shortly .",
    "mcintyre and cairns give a formula for the rotation number for generic immersed curves ( which they call _ normal _ ) in @xcite . in the case where the curve is homologically trivial , their formula reduces to the following :    for each positive ( respectively negative ) integer @xmath74 , let @xmath106 be the region where @xmath55 is greater than or equal to ( respectively less than or equal to ) @xmath74 .",
    "then the rotation number of @xmath3 is given by @xmath107 if @xmath35 is a torus , and @xmath108 otherwise .",
    "now observe that @xmath109 so @xmath110 @xmath111 by equation ( [ topological - formula ] ) , @xmath112 @xmath113 so evaluating @xmath66 at @xmath29 gives @xmath114 thus ,    the rotation number of @xmath3 is given by @xmath115 if @xmath35 is a torus , and @xmath116 otherwise .",
    "using the formula for the change of base point , equation ( [ basepoint - change ] ) , and plugging in @xmath29 , we see that if @xmath117 , @xmath118 thus @xmath105 may depend on the choice of @xmath46 but @xmath119 does not .",
    "let @xmath120 be the smoothing of @xmath3 , and let @xmath121 be the region where @xmath122 for all @xmath68 .",
    "the euler characteristic of the region where @xmath123 is @xmath124 so @xmath125 @xmath126 solving for @xmath66 yields @xmath127",
    "in order to connect our results to viro s generalization of @xmath0 , it is necessary to further generalize our definition of an index function .",
    "let a _ rational index function _ for @xmath3 be any function @xmath128 which is locally constant and which increases by 1 when we make a positive crossing over @xmath3",
    ". clearly any two rational index functions for @xmath3 differ by a rational constant . for any rational index function @xmath129 for @xmath3",
    "we can extend @xmath129 to a function on @xmath35 by averaging over adjacent regions as before , and then define @xmath130 by replacing @xmath55 with @xmath129 in the definition of @xmath47 .",

    "the formula for @xmath93 as an integral with respect to the euler characteristic and the formula for the change of base point generalize in the obvious way .",
    "explicitly , @xmath135 and for any two rational index functions @xmath136 with @xmath137 , @xmath138    for any @xmath139 in the relative homology group @xmath140 such that @xmath141 is the fundamental class of @xmath3 , one can define @xmath142 for @xmath143 as follows : @xmath142 is the image of @xmath139 under the map @xmath144 where the map @xmath145 is the relativization homomorphism and the map @xmath146 is the canonical isomorphism .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath147 gives an isomorphism between elements of @xmath140 with boundary @xmath3 and rational index functions for @xmath3 , so results about general rational index functions may be rephrased as results about functions of the form @xmath148 ; indeed , it is the latter formulation that viro uses to define @xmath14 .",
    "here we present his results using the language of rational index functions for greater congruence with the rest of the paper .    for @xmath149 , viro defines @xmath150 as follows : find the unique rational index function @xmath151 for @xmath120 such that @xmath152 ( note that the condition @xmath149 is necessary here to ensure the existence and uniqueness of @xmath151 . ) then @xmath153 we can now state the relationship between @xmath93 and @xmath0 .",
