    "rs canum venaticorum systems ( rs cvn ) are ( normally ) contact binaries with two active late - type stars having orbital periods between 2 and 20 days ( hall 1992 ) .",
    "both components have strong chromospheric , transition region and coronal emission .",
    "this is generally assumed to be the result of a powerful dynamo action caused by rapid rotation and deep convection zones leading to magnetic activity several orders of magnitude greater than the sun s ( vogt et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "er  vulpeculae is a bright , well - studied rs cvn system which we chose to test our observation that certain ` 51  peg'-type planets induce detectable chromospheric activity on their parent stars through magnetic interaction ( shkolnik et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "we observed ca ii h ( 3967  ) and k ( 3933  ) emission as the primary optical indicators of chromospheric activity because the stellar ca ii h and k photospheric absorption lines are so broad and deep that the reversals are seen in high contrast against the shallow stellar core ( @xmath2  10% of the continuum ) .",
    "er vul s short orbital period , brightness ( v = 7.4 ) , and high level of chromospheric emission makes it an ideal target for observing phase - dependent variability .",
    "this tidally - synchronized binary is unusual in that it consists of two solar - type stars orbiting each other with a relatively short period of 0.698 days .",
    "the stars are nearly identical ( g1 - 2  v and g3  v ) with equal radii ( 1.07 @xmath3 ) and a mass ratio of 0.947 .",
    "they are only 3.97 @xmath3 apart in a circular orbit but they are not in contact . the orbital inclination of 67@xmath4 , this configuration leads to partial eclipses of approximately 12% ( gunn & doyle 1997 ) .",
    "the projected rotational velocities of the primary and secondary components are ( @xmath5sin@xmath6)@xmath7 km  s@xmath8 and ( @xmath5sin@xmath6)@xmath9 km  s@xmath8 ( duemmler et al .",
    "this rapid rotation causes very broad and blended features in the double - lined spectrum .",
    "er vul has been studied in almost every spectral region to discover , map and understand its intense stellar and circumstellar activity .",
    "piskunov ( 1996 ) used doppler imaging to map the surfaces of both stars from 12 high - resolution spectra centered on 6440  at the nordic telescope .",
    "he identified hot spots on both components at sub - stellar longitudes , which he presumed to be due to reflection .",

    "they measured deviations of @xmath210 km  s@xmath8 from the radial velocity ( rv ) curve at phases when a star is receding from the observer .",
    "they suggest that this is caused by localized excess emission near the sub - binary point on the star .",
    "alternatively , a weakening of the emission at opposite orbital phases could produce the same effect .",
    "they measured a higher level of activity on the cooler , secondary component , which was already known to be globally more active than the primary ( gunn & doyle 1997 ; akirli et al .",

    "exosat observations exhibit a homogeneous x - ray corona ( white et al .",
    "the lack of any eclipses in these two wavelengths can be interpreted as either the active regions are at high latitudes or the regions of x - ray and radio emission extend quite far beyond the binary system , perhaps in the form of huge coronal loops .",

    "for a close binary with rapidly rotating components such as those of er  vul , the broadening function ( bf ) approach is optimal to obtain radial velocity information for one - dimensional , radial - velocity domain images of the stellar surfaces .",
    "the broadening function approach was used for the first time in 1992 ( rucinski 1992 ) and subsequently , for analysis of radial velocities of close binary stars .",
    "the technical summaries are in rucinski ( 1999 ) and rucinski ( 2002 ) .",
    "the bf method uses a spectrum of a chromospherically inactive star as a template .",
    "the template could either be a synthetic spectrum or a real spectrum of a sharp - lined ( slowly rotating ) star that is artificially doppler broadened by the bfs . subtracting a broadened template spectrum from that of an active binary leaves only emissions from stellar active regions such as plages or prominences .",
    "the principal properties of the approach , described in detail in rucinski ( 1992 , 1999 , 2002)rucinski .",
    "] , are based on the fact that the observed spectrum of a rapidly - rotating or revolving star can be approximated by a convolution of a sharp - line star spectrum with a kernel describing the observed radial velocity field .",
    "thus , the broadening function @xmath15 , in @xmath16 , is a kernel in @xmath17 . in this integral equation",
    ", @xmath18 is the `` program '' spectrum and @xmath19 is the `` sharp '' or the template spectrum .",
    "the equation can be solved by representing the convolution operation by a set of over - determined algebraic equations ; @xmath19 & @xmath18 are usually defined over thousands of pixels , while @xmath15 is usually defined over hundreds of pixels , so the equations can be cast as a standard least - squares problem with an over - determinacy typically of @xmath20 times .",
    "the use of a radial velocity standard star of similar spectral type for the template @xmath19 straightforwardly relates the results to the velocity scale and insures the use of all , even the weakest , lines which would not appear in model spectra ; this property is similar to that of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) .",
    "however , the resolution of the bf depends on and is entirely defined by the instrumental setup , which is a great advantage over the ccf which combines all sources of broadening .",
    "this frequently leads to the necessity of excising wide hydrogen lines , molecular features , etc .",
    "the bf is derived through a linear process , so that its features can be used directly for estimates of the the relative light intensities .",
    "a very similar technique , called the least squares deconvolution ( lsd ) , was developed mainly for magnetic zeeman pattern extraction by donati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and then used for radial velocity and line broadening applications ( e.g.  collier cameron et al .",
    "2002 , reiners & schmitt 2003 ) .",
    "both techniques use the singular value decomposition for determination of the spectral line locations and broadening , but the lsd is typically used with model spectra while the bf formalism relies on stellar templates for direct tie - ins to the radial velocities of standard stars and accounts for weak lines not present in model spectra .    for a close binary like er  vul ,",
    "the bf is essentially a projection of the system into the radial velocity domain .",
    "if stars are spherical and rotate rigidly , the bf is expected to have the ellipsoidal shape predicted by the struve profile ( solana & frenley 1997 ) .",
    "spots will appear as notches in the bf at certain velocities .",
    "it is important to recognized that any emission components will appear as dark notches , which is perhaps somewhat less intuitive ; however , we do not expect any emission components in the photospheric lines used to determine the bfs in this study .",
    "we used the average spectrum of hd  209458 , formed from three spectra taken a few weeks prior to our 2002 august observing run , as the template ( standard ) star with which to calculate the bfs for the er  vul spectra .",
    "hd  209458 is a g0  v star making it a good match to both of er  vul s components .",
    "computations of the bfs involve inversion of large matrices .",
    "the computing time can be reduced if the spectra are reduced in length by re - sampling to lower resolution .",
    "the full resolution of 0.013   per pixel ( 0.95 km  s@xmath8 ) was deemed unnecessary ; we reduced it two - fold to the velocity step of 1.9 km  s@xmath8 . considering that the spectral features of er  vul are very broad",
    ", there is no significant loss of information from this step .",
    "the total number of useful pixels in the equal - velocity - step spectra was 2250 ( at 1.9 km  s@xmath8 ) , while the wide range of the er  vul velocities dictated a relatively large spectral window of 700 km  s@xmath8 or 369 pixels .",
    "thus , the overall over - determinacy in the bf solutions was moderate , 6 times , which was adequate to provide high - quality bf profiles .",
    "only the upper 2/3 of the er vul spectrum ( as measured from the peak flux of the pseudo - continuum from in between the two strong ca ii lines ) was used in the calculations of the bfs in order to exclude the ca  ii reversals and to eliminate any departures from the photospheric component due to chromospheric activity . besides",
    ", only the well defined upper parts of the spectra found in regions between and outside the ca  ii cores , which are rich in narrow lines , could provide a good basis for the bf determination .",
    "the most difficult and unusual step in the bf determination was the normalization of the strongly curved spectrum outside the ca  ii features .",
    "the spectra of er  vul are severely blended and there are no places where we can see the photospheric continuum .",
    "the normalization was done by an interactive determination of the upper envelope to the spectrum and division of the spectra by such an approximate continuum . that this is not the actual photospheric continuum is clearly indicated by the sums of the bfs which , in spite of the spectral type of the template ( g0v ) matching very well with the of the components of er  vul , are not close to unity for each component , but are instead at the level of @xmath21 .",
    "this means that about 2/3 of the total amount of absorption in the spectral lines of er  vul is located in unaccounted - for line blends .",
    "the combined effect of the blending is the lowering of the effective continuum and shallower depths of those lines that remain visible . because this is still a linear transformation and",
    "the broadening functions are determined through a linear process , the total intensities of the bfs are affected while the shapes and positions of the bfs remain entirely unchanged . as a final step , we normalized the total intensities to 1 .",
    "the final bfs are very well defined and clearly show both of the components .",
    "all determined bfs are plotted in figure  [ bf_specplot ] .",
    "figure  [ bf_3phases ] provides a closer look at the bfs at @xmath14 = 0.25 , 0.50 and 0.62 .",
    "we can determine rvs and hence the system orbital parameters from the bfs as measured in the next section .",
    "we do not see any evidence of bright or dark spots on the stellar surfaces which would appear as travelling notches in the bfs implying that more than 50% of the stellar disk may be covered by one or more spots .",
    "this is consistent with sokoloff & piskunov ( 2002 ) who observe a large , high - latitude cool spots on er vul .",

    "the rms scatter of the data relative to the solid curves are 6.15 km  s@xmath8 for the primary and 4.30 km  s@xmath8 for the secondary .",
    "the deviation of the primary by @xmath28  @xmath010 km  s@xmath8 at @xmath29 0.75 may be due to spectral line distortions caused by less stellar activity relative to the rest of the star and could be an indication of relatively _ inactive _ longitudes .",

    "the rapid rotation and orbital velocities of the two components of er vul introduce severe doppler broadening and line blending making it difficult to distinguish the contribution from each star separately .",
    "the bf technique allows the chromospheric emission for each star to be isolated from the rest of the stellar flux by subtracting a template spectrum convolved with the appropriate bf .",
    "figure  [ conv ] illustrates the steps involved at a given phase : ( a ) the sharp - lined spectrum of hd  209458 that we used as our standard , ( b ) the bf measured from the er vul spectrum at @xmath14 = 0.25 ( quadrature ) , ( c ) the convolution of the bf with the sharp - lined template , and ( d ) the observed er vul spectrum at @xmath14 = 0.25 .",
    "this procedure to remove the photospheric contribution to the spectrum works well as is seen in the residual spectrum ( with no normalization ) in figure  [ diff10 ] .",
    "the three origins of h & k emission remain : the chromospheres of the primary and secondary stars , and a broad emission which , at this phase ( @xmath14 = 0.25 ) , is highly redshifted .",
    "unfortunately , the 60- - wide spectrum cuts off the broad emission red - ward of the h line so we will not discuss the h emission much further as it suffers from truncation in the convolution .",
    "the fluctuations seen in the figure between the h and k lines ( 1800 @xmath0 3200 km  s@xmath8 ) are most likely due to two processing issues : 1 ) the spectral type of hd  209458 matches er vul s primary star very well , but differs by 3 sub - classes for the secondary ; and 2 ) when comparing broad - lined spectra with highly - blended features , the normalization becomes a tricky task .",
    "this challenge arises during the calculation of the bfs and then again when setting the pseudo - continuum level of the standard and stellar spectra before subtraction .",
    "the stellar and template spectra used to produce figure  [ diff10 ] , were merely set to the same maximum level .",
    "the larger fluctuations in this region may also be attributed to the presence of the large , high - latitude cool spots observed by sokoloff & piskunov ( 2002 ) . such spots would create flat - bottomed photospheric lines when highly rotationally broadened causing small bumps when the broadened template is subtracted .    before subtracting the convolved templates , the er vul spectra had to be rebinned to the same 1.9 km  s@xmath8 per pixel as the bfs and templates . a cross - correlation",
    "was then performed with iraf s _ fxcor _ routine of each er vul spectrum with its corresponding template , using only the photospheric flux between the h and k absorption lines gives the best alignment of the spectra before subtraction .",

    "gunn & doyle ( 1997 ) base their assumption that er vul s chromospheric emission is close to saturation on the very large filling factor they obtained .",
    "saturation of the chromospheric emission may be another explanation for the lack of variation seen the k emission of the two stars .",
    "the extremely strong emission in practically every spectral activity indicator supports this possibility .",

    "the observed ca  ii emission from the er vul system includes : 1 ) high - latitude active regions on one or both of the stars that are covering large areas on the stellar surface and 2 ) a high - velocity stream of hot gas flowing on to the secondary in a widening spiral arriving on the surface at approximately 30 @xmath0 60@xmath1 beyond the sub - binary longitude .",
    "the decreased flux of the stream during @xmath14 = 0.60 @xmath0 0.90 is due to its partial eclipse by the secondary .",
    "the change in velocity and flux of the broad emission is evident in figure  [ opposite_diffs ] where a sample of k residuals are overplotted onto their ` opposite phase ' residuals .",
    "the active region on each star is most likely not confined to a narrow longitudinal range but may cover as much as 50% of the hemisphere .",
    "however , it appears as if the center of the broad emission ( and any associated surface hot spot ) leads the sub - binary point by @xmath2 30 @xmath0 40@xmath4 .",
    "plotting the integrated residual k flux as a function of orbital phase ( figure  [ kemission_phi ] ) , we see an increase in k emission that peaks near @xmath14 = 0.38 and has a width of about 90 degrees . in this case , the reflection effect as the cause of the heating as suggested by piskunov ( 1996 ) is not supported since the hot spot emitting the excess ca ii is not centered on the sub - binary point .",
    "our results are consistent with zeinali et al .",

    "( 1988 ) explained photometric peculiarities in er vul as due to circumstellar matter .",
    "hall & ramsey ( 1994 ) surveyed ten rs cvn binary systems ( not including er vul ) on which they have shown that large regions of extended , prominence - like material are common features with moderate- to high - velocity flows ranging from several tens of km  s@xmath8 to 170 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that high - velocity streams , prominences , and circumstellar material are all part of er vul s dynamic environment .    at the very end of our observations",

    "there is likely to be a spot on the surface of the secondary associated with the impact of the high - velocity stream of hot plasma .",

    "er vul has been the object of a number of photometric investigations ( e.g.  harmanec et al .",
    "2004 ; olah et al .",
    "1994 ; hill et al .",
    "1990 ) , and so the solution computed by harmanec et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from combined ubvri and radial velocity data was used as a starting point .",
    "the temperatures of the two stars were fixed at the values adopted by hill et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "the final adopted inclination and mean stellar radii , computed after making minor adjustments to match the depths and widths of the eclipses , are summarized in table  [ model_data ] .",
    "the ratio of the stellar radii is intermediate between the values found by hill et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , who found that the components have the same radii , and harmanec et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who use r@xmath30/r@xmath31 = 0.64 .",
    "ccr    @xmath6 & 67.99@xmath1 + @xmath32 & 0.291 + @xmath33 & 0.240 + spot long & 36@xmath1 + spot rad & 54@xmath1 + spot temp & 1.015t@xmath34 +    keeping the geometric parameters fixed , a second set of runs were made in which a hot spot was added to the secondary , with parameters chosen to reproduce the magnitude difference between the out of eclipse maxima in the light curve .",
    "preliminary experiments indicated that the spot must be close to the orbital plane , and so the latitude of the spot was fixed in the orbital plane for all subsequent runs .",
    "the spot parameters that were investigated in greater detail are ( 1 ) the longitude of the spot centroid , ( 2 ) the spot radius , and ( 3 ) the temperature of the spot with respect to that of the surrounding photosphere .",
    "the results were then compared with the light curves to identify those models that are best able to reproduce the outside eclipse light variations ; the introduction of spots were found to have only a minor impact on the eclipse minima .",
    "the models that best match the data favor a spot on the hemisphere of the ( cooler ) secondary star facing the ( hotter ) primary star , but with a center that is offset by 30 @xmath0 40@xmath1 from the line connecting the two stars -  in excellent agreement with the phase at which the peak ca ii emission is seen in figure  [ kemission_phi ] .",
    "in addition , large spots that cover an entire hemisphere of the cooler star s surface and have temperatures that are 1 - 2% hotter than the undisturbed photosphere are better able to match the out of eclipse light variations than models with smaller spots and hotter temperatures .    the model that best matches the light curve is shown in figure  [ ervul_lc ] , and the spot parameters used in this simulation are listed in table  [ model_data ] .",
    "the light curve generated without spots is also shown for comparison .",
    "the agreement between the model with spots and the observations shows systematic differences outside of eclipse , and it is conceivable that models that include refined physics , such as multiple spots , third light from a stream , and/or temperature structure within the spot(s ) may give better agreement with the data .",
    "we have presented 42 high - quality ca ii h & k spectra from the cfht that cover nearly the entire 17-hour orbit of er vul in search of phase - dependent chromospheric activity .",
    "the rapid rotation causes severe line - blending and broadening such that it is difficult to distinguish between the spectra of the two stars . to do this , we invoked the broadening function formalism .",
    "we calculated bfs from the photospheric absorption lines outside of the h and k lines , convolved a sharp - lined spectrum with the bf at each orbital phase , and then subtracted the convolved template from the corresponding er vul spectrum .",
    "the residuals consisted of only ca ii chromospheric emission .",
    "we focus only on the k line since the h line suffered from end effects .",
    "the k emission appears to come from three different locations in the system : the primary star , the secondary star and a broad stream flowing towards the secondary at a velocity of 320 km  s@xmath8 . the in - falling material from the stream onto the secondary enhances the emission from that region indicated by a ) an increase in total observed k emission and b ) a hot spot on the photosphere as seen in a concurrent photometric lightcurve .",
    "both are consistent with an active region leading the sub - binary longitude by 30 @xmath0 40@xmath1 .",
    "er vul is not an ideal amplified analog of planet - induced stellar activity .",
    "few 51 peg primaries have spun up into sychronous rotation , thereby energizing the dynamo level seen in er vul and the 51 peg secondaries are likely to be tidally locked and therefore may have less extensive magnetic fields than jupiter . none the less , it is interesting to note that the chromospheric activity of hd179949 was synchronized with the 3.1 d revolution period of the secondary for two years ( shkolnik et al .",
