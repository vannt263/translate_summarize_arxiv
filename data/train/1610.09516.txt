    "the crime and violence street gangs introduce into neighborhoods is a growing epidemic in cities around the world . today , over 1.23 million people in the united states are members of a _ street gang _  @xcite , which is a coalition of peers , united by mutual interests , with identifiable leadership and internal organization , who act collectively to conduct illegal activity and to control a territory , facility , or enterprise  @xcite .",
    "they promote criminal activities such as drug trafficking , assault , robbery , and threatening or intimidating a neighborhood  @xcite .",
    "moreover , data from the centers for disease control in the united states suggests that the victims of at least 1.3% of all gang - related homicides are merely innocent bystanders who live in gang occupied neighborhoods  @xcite .",
    "street gang members have established online presences coinciding with their physical occupation of neighborhoods .",
    "the national gang threat assessment report confirms that at least tens of thousands of gang members are using social networking websites such as twitter and video sharing websites such as youtube in their daily life  @xcite .",
    "they are very active online ; the 2007 national assessment center s survey of gang members found that 25% of individuals in gangs use the internet for at least 4 hours a week  @xcite .",
    "gang members typically use social networking sites and social media to develop online respect for their street gang  @xcite and to post intimidating , threatening images or videos  @xcite .",
    "this `` cyber- '' or `` internet banging ''  @xcite behavior is precipitated by the fact that an increasing number of young members of the society are joining gangs  @xcite , and these young members have become enamored with technology and with the notion of sharing information quickly and publicly through social media .",
    "stronger police surveillance in the physical spaces where gangs congregate further encourages gang members to seek out virtual spaces such as social media to express their affiliation , to sell drugs , and to celebrate their illegal activities  @xcite .",
    "gang members are able to post publicly on twitter without fear of consequences because there are few tools law enforcement can use to surveil this medium  @xcite .",
    "police departments across the united states instead rely on manual processes to search social media for gang member profiles and to study their posts .",
    "for example , the new york city police department employs over 300 detectives to combat teen violence triggered by insults , dares , and threats exchanged on social media , and the toronto police department teaches officers about the use of social media in investigations  @xcite .",
    "officer training is broadly limited to understanding policies on using twitter in investigations and best practices for data storage  @xcite .",
    "the safety and security of city neighborhoods can thus be improved if law enforcement were equipped with intelligent tools to study social media for gang activity .",
    "the need for better tools for law enforcement can not be underscored enough .",
    "recent news reports have shown that many incidents involving gangs start on twitter , escalate over time , and lead to an offline event that could have been prevented by an early warning .",
    "for example , the media reported on a possible connection between the death of a teenage rapper from illinois and the final set of tweets he posted .",
    "one of his last tweets linked to a video of him shouting vulgar words at a rival gang member who , in return , replied _",
    "`` i m a kill you '' _ on social media . in a following tweet ,",
    "the teenage rapper posted _",
    "`` i m on 069 '' _ , revealing his location , and was shot dead soon after that post .",
    "subsequent investigation revealed that the rivalry leading to his death began and was carried out entirely on social media .",
    "other reporting has revealed how innocent bystanders have also become targets in online fights , leaving everyone in a neighborhood at risk .",
    "this paper investigates whether gang member profiles can be identified automatically on twitter , which can enable better surveillance of gang members on social media . classifying",
    "twitter profiles into particular types of users has been done in other contexts  @xcite , but gang member profiles pose unique challenges .",
    "for example , many twitter profile classifiers search for contextual clues in tweets and profile descriptions  @xcite , but gang member profiles use a rapidly changing lexicon of keywords and phrases that often have only a local , geographic context .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : twitterprofiles ] , which shows the twitter profile descriptions of two verified deceased gang members .",
    "the profile of @osoarrogantjojo provides evidence that he belongs to a rival gang of the black disciples by ` # bdk ` , a hashtag that is only known to those involved with gang culture in chicago .",
    "s profile mentions ` # pbg ` and our investigations revealed that this hashtag is newly founded and stands for the pooh bear gang , a gang that was formerly known as the insane cutthroat gangsters . given the very local , rapidly changing lexicon of gang members on social media , building a database of keywords , phrases , and other identifiers to find gang members nationally is not feasible .",
    "instead , this study proposes heterogeneous sets of features derived not only from profile and tweet text but also from the emoji usage , profile images , and links to youtube videos reflecting their music culture .",
    "a large set of gang member profiles , obtained through a careful data collection process , is compared against non - gang member profiles to find contrasting features .",
    "experimental results show that using these sets of features , we can build a classifier that has a low false positive rate and a promising @xmath1-score of 0.7755 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : rr ] discusses the related literature and positions how this work differs from other related works .",
    "section [ sec : dc ] discusses the data collection , manual feature selection and our approach to identify gang member profiles .",
    "section [ sec : eval ] gives a detailed explanation for evaluation of the proposed method and the results in detail .",
    "section [ sec : con ] concludes the work reported while discussing the future work planned .",
    "gang violence is a well studied social science topic dating back to 1927  @xcite .",
    "however , the notions of `` cyber- '' or `` internet banging '' , which is defined as _",
    "`` the phenomenon of gang affiliates using social media sites to trade insults or make violent threats that lead to homicide or victimization '' _",
    "@xcite , was only recently introduced  @xcite .",
    "_ introduced the concept of `` internet banging '' and studied how social media is now being used as a tool for gang self - promotion and as a way for gang members to gain and maintain street credibility  @xcite .",
    "they also discussed the relationship between gang - related crime and hip - hop culture , giving examples on how hip - hop music shared on social media websites targeted at harassing rival gang members often ended up in real - world collisions among those gangs .",
    "et al . _ and patton _ et al .",
    "_ have also reported that street gangs perform internet banging with social media posts of videos depicting their illegal behaviors , threats to rival gangs , and firearms  @xcite .    the ability to take action on these discoveries",
    "is limited by the tools available to discover gang members on social media and to analyze the content they post  @xcite .",
    "recent attempts to improve our abilities include a proposed architecture for a surveillance system that can learn the structure , function , and operation of gangs through what they post on social media  @xcite .",
    "however , the architecture requires a set of gang member profiles for input , thus assuming that they have already been discovered .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite devised a method to automatically collect tweets from a group of gang members operating in detroit , mi . however , their approach required the profile names of the gang members to be known beforehand , and data collection was localized to a single city in the country .",
    "this work builds upon existing methods to automatically discover gang member profiles on twitter .",
    "this type of user profile classification problem has been explored in a diverse set of applications such as political affiliation  @xcite , ethnicity  @xcite , gender  @xcite , predicting brand loyalty  @xcite , and user occupations  @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches may utilize an abundance of positive examples in their training data , and only rely on a single feature type ( typically , tweet text ) .",
    "whereas most profile classifiers focus on a single _ type _ of feature ( e.g. profile text ) , we consider the use of a variety of feature types , including emoji , youtube links , and photo features .",
    "this section discusses the methodology we followed to study and classify the twitter profiles of gang members automatically .",
    "it includes a semi - automatic data collection process to discover a large set of verifiable gang member profiles , an evaluation of the tweets of gang and non - gang member posts to identify promising features , and the deployment of multiple supervised learning algorithms to perform the classification .",
    ".number of gang member profiles captured . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for each 10-fold cross validation experiment , we report three evaluation metrics for the ` gang ' and ` non - gang ' classes , namely , the precision = @xmath2 , recall = @xmath3 , and @xmath1-score = @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of true positives , @xmath6 is the number of false positives , @xmath7 is the number of true negatives , and @xmath8 is the number of false negatives .",
    "we report these metrics for the positive ` gang ' and negative ` non - gang ' classes separately because of class imbalance in our dataset .",
    "table  [ results : usertweetsuni ] presents the average precision , recall , and @xmath1-score over the 10 folds for the single - feature and combined feature classifiers .",
    "the table includes , in braces ( ` \\ { } ' ) , the number of gang and non - gang profiles that contain a particular feature type , and hence the number of profiles used for the 10-fold cross validation .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that _ any _ twitter profile is not that of a gang member , predicting a twitter user as a non - gang member is much easier than predicting a twitter user as a gang member .",
    "moreover false positive classifications of the ` gang ' class may be detrimental to law enforcement investigations , which may go awry as they surveil an innocent person based on the classifier s suggestion .",
    "we thus believe that a small false positive rate of the ` gang ' class to be an especially important evaluation metric .",
    "we say that a classifier is ` ideal ' if it demonstrates high precision , recall , and @xmath1-score for the ` gang ' class while performing well on the ` non - gang ' class as well .",
    "the best performing classifier that considers single features is a random forest model over tweet features ( t ) , with a reasonable @xmath1-score of 0.7229 for the ` gang ' class",
    ". it also features the highest @xmath1-score for the ` non - gang ' class ( 0.9671 ) .",
    "its strong performance is intuitive given the striking differences in language as shown in figure  [ fig : image2 ] and discussed in section  [ sec : data_analysis_tweet_text ] .",
    "we also noted that music features offer promising results , with an @xmath1-score of 0.6505 with a naive bayes classifier , as well as emoji features with an @xmath1-score of 0.6067 also achieved by a naive bayes classifier .",
    "however , the use of profile data and image tags by themselves yield relatively poor @xmath1-scores no matter which classifier considered",
    ". there may be two reasons for this despite the differences we observed in section  [ sec : data_analysis ] .",
    "first , these two feature types did not generate a large number of specific features for learning .",
    "for example , descriptions are limited to just 160 characters per profile , leading to a limited number of unigrams ( in our dataset , 10 on average ) that can be used to train the classifiers .",
    "second , the profile images were tagged by a third party web service which is not specifically designed to identify gang hand signs , drugs and guns , which are often shared by gang members . this led to a small set of image tags in their profiles that were fairly generic , i.e.",
    ", the image tags in figure  [ fig : imagetags ] such as ` people ' , ` man ' , and ` adult ' .    combining these diverse sets of features into a single classifier yields even better results . our results for _ model(1 ) _ show that the random forest achieves the highest @xmath1-scores for both ` gang ' ( 0.7364 ) and ` non - gang ' ( 0.9690 ) classes _ and _ yields the best precision of 0.8792 , which corresponds to a low false positive rate when labeling a profile as a gang member . despite the fact that it has lower positive recall compared to the second best performing classifier ( a random forest trained over only tweet text features ( t ) ) , for this problem setting , we should be willing to increase the chance that a gang member will go unclassified if it means reducing the chance of applying a ` gang ' label to a non - gang member . when we tested _",
    "model(2 ) _ , a random forrest classifier achieved an @xmath1-score of 0.7755 ( improvement of 7.28% with respect to the best performing single feature type classifier ( t ) ) for ` gang ' class with a precision of 0.8961 ( improvement of 6.26% with respect to ( t ) ) and a recall of 0.6994 ( improvement of 9.26% with respect to ( t ) ) . _",
    "model(2 ) _ thus outperforms _",
    "model(1 ) _ , and we expect its performance to improve with the availability of more training data with all feature types .",
    "we also tested the trained classifiers using a set of twitter profiles from a separate data collection process that may emulate the classifier s operation in a real - time setting . for this experiment",
    ", we captured real - time tweets from los angeles , ca and from ten south side , chicago neighborhoods that are known for gang - related activities  @xcite using the twitter streaming api .",
    "we consider these areas with known gang presence on social media to ensure that some positive profiles would appear in our test set .",
    "we ultimately collected 24,162 twitter profiles : 15,662 from los angeles , and 8,500 from chicago .",
    "we populated data for each profile by using the 3,200 most recent tweets ( the maximum that can be collected from twitter s api ) for each profile . since the 24,162 profiles are far too many to label manually , we qualitatively study those profiles the classifier placed into the ` gang ' class .",
    "we used the training dataset to train our best performing random forest classifier ( which use all feature types ) and tested it on the test dataset .",
    "we then analyzed the twitter profiles that our classifier labeled as belonging to the ` gang ' class .",
    "each of those profiles had several features which overlap with gang members such as displaying hand signs and weapons in their profile images or in videos posted by them , gang names or gang - related hashtags in their profile descriptions , frequent use of curse words , and the use of terms such as _  my homie \" _ to refer to self - identified gang members .",
    "representative tweets extracted from those profiles are depicted in figure  [ testset_examples ] .",
    "the most frequent words found in tweets from those profiles were _ shit , nigga , got , bitch , go , fuck etc . _ and their user profiles had terms such as _ free , artist , shit , fuck , freedagang , and ripthefallen_.",
    "they had frequently used emojis such as _ face with tears of joy , hundred points symbol , fire , skull , money bag , and pistol_. for some profiles , it was less obvious that the classifier correctly identified a gang member .",
    "such profiles used the same emojis and curse words commonly found in gang members profiles , but their profile picture and tweet content was not indicative of a gang affiliation . in conclusion , we find that in a real - time - like setting , the classifier to be able to extract profiles with features that strongly suggest gang affiliation .",
    "of course , these profiles demand further investigation and extensive evidence from other sources in order to draw a concrete conclusion , especially in the context of a law enforcement investigation .",
    "we refrain from reporting any profile names or specific details about the profiles labeled as a ` gang ' member to comply with the applicable irb governing this human subject research .",
    "this paper presented an approach to address the problem of automatically identifying gang member profiles on twitter . despite the challenges in developing such automated systems , mainly due to difficulties in finding online gang member profiles for developing training datasets , we proposed an approach that uses features extracted from textual descriptions , emojis , images and videos shared on twitter ( textual features extracted from images , and videos ) . exploratory analysis of these types of features revealed interesting , and sometimes striking differences in the ways gang and non - gang members use twitter .",
    "classifiers trained over features that highlight these differences , were evaluated under 10-fold cross validation .",
    "our best classifier achieved a promising @xmath1-score of 0.7755 over the ` gang ' profiles when all types of features were considered .",
    "future work will strengthen our training dataset by including more gang member twitter profiles by searching for more location - independent keywords .",
    "we also plan to develop our own image classification system specifically designed to classify images found on gang member profiles .",
    "we would also like to experiment with building dictionaries that contain gang names to understand whether _",
    "`` having a gang name in the profile description '' _ as a feature can improve our results .",
    "finally , we would also like to study how can we further improve our classifier models using word embeddings  @xcite and social networks of known gang members .",
