    "the origin and chemical composition of uhe crs ( @xmath5  ev ) is a long - standing enigma in cr physics  @xcite . the spectrum at these energies is expected to be dominated by extragalactic sources that have not yet been unambiguously identified .",
    "the average mass number of the composition can be inferred directly from atmospheric cr showers by measuring the elongation rate distribution and comparing this to simulations .",
    "recent results of the pierre auger collaboration  @xcite indicate a transition of uhe crs within the energy range @xmath6  ev to @xmath7  ev from a light spectrum ( consistent with protons ) towards a heavier composition  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the hires collaboration  @xcite finds a mass composition compatible with that of a proton - dominated spectrum  @xcite .",
    "indirect evidence for the cr composition can come from various features seen in the spectrum .",
    "the `` ankle '' at about @xmath8  ev seems to be a natural candidate for the transition between galactic and extragalactic crs  @xcite , but a lower energy crossover at the `` second knee '' at about @xmath9  ev has also been advocated for proton - dominated spectra  @xcite .",
    "proton - dominance beyond the ankle is expected to be limited beyond the _ greisen - zatspin - kuzmin _ ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite due to resonant pion photo - production in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "intriguingly , a suppression of the cr spectrum at the expected energy of about @xmath10  ev has been observed at a statistically significant level  @xcite and is consistent with a proton dominance at these energies . however , a similar feature could also originate from nuclear photo - disintegration of uhe cr nuclei in the cosmic radiation background ( crb ) , or from an _ in situ _ energy cut - off of the injection spectrum .    in light of these yet inconclusive and even controversial experimental findings",
    "it is important to consider alternative cosmic messengers associated with the production and propagation of uhe cr nuclei .",
    "the sources of uhe crs are also expected to emit high energy radiation in the form of neutrinos and @xmath0-rays due to their interaction with ambient matter , radiation or magnetic fields inside or in the vicinity of the acceleration region .",
    "the strength and spectral energy distribution of this emission depends , however , not only on the uncertain chemical composition and injection spectrum of uhe crs but also on the source environment .",
    "this dependence on source parameters is absent for the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos and @xmath0-rays that are produced by cr interactions with the crb and intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) ; these contributions can be directly related to the observed spectrum of uhe crs .",
    "the dominant interactions of uhe cr nuclei ( atomic number @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 ) with the crb are nuclear photo - disintegation  @xcite , pion photo - production  @xcite and bethe - heitler ( bh ) pair production  @xcite .",
    "photo - disintegration in the cmb leads to a fast break - up of heavy nuclei at energies of about @xmath11  ev with an interaction length of the order of a few mpc .",
    "the direct contribution of photo - disintegration to cosmogenic neutrinos and @xmath0-rays is negligible  @xcite .",
    "the dominant channel for cosmogenic neutrinos is the photo - production of charged pions in the cmb and their subsequent decay  @xcite .",
    "this process can be approximated by treating the nucleons of the nuclei as free protons and neutrons with energy @xmath12 resulting in an production threshold with cmb photons of about @xmath13  ev . in the decay chain of the charged pion the three emerging neutrinos carry away about 3/4 of the total pion s energy .",
    "photo - nucleon interactions produce roughly equal number of charged and neutral pions .",
    "gamma - rays and @xmath14 produced via @xmath15 and @xmath16 decay , respectively , subsequently cascade on crb photons via repeated @xmath17 pair production and inverse compton scattering .",
    "the net result is a pile up of @xmath0-rays at gev - tev energies , just below the threshold for further pair production on the diffuse optical background .",
    "another contribution to this electromagnetic cascade comes from the bh production of @xmath18 pairs .",
    "the corresponding energy loss length of cr nuclei is minimal at energies of @xmath19  ev and decreases with charge as @xmath20 .",
    "the energy loss rate @xmath21 in electrons , positrons and @xmath0-rays determines the bolometric flux of the cosmogenic gev - tev @xmath0-ray signal and cosmogenic neutrinos .",
    "the energy loss via pion photo - production at cr energy @xmath22 can be approximated by the energy loss rate of nucleons @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "since pion photo - production has a relatively high energy threshold the contribution of cosmogenic neutrinos and @xmath0-rays from this channel typically depends on the maximal energy of the uhe cr emission .",
    "this can lead to a significant model dependence of the prediction .",
    "bethe - heitler @xmath18 pairs are already produced at much lower energy .",
    "the interaction can be treated as a continuous energy loss with rate @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the bh energy loss of protons .",
    "the @xmath27-dependence of this process and the low threshold makes this channel an important contributor to the @xmath0-ray cascade .",
    "we will study in the following the relative contributions of bh pair production and pion photo - production to the @xmath0-ray signal for cr models involving heavy nuclei . in section",
    "[ sec : propagation ] we start with a brief review of the propagation of uhe crs and the calculation of the spectra .",

    "we discuss the prospects to detect the closest sources of uhe cr nuclei as point sources of cosmogenic @xmath0-rays .",

    "the angular - averaged differential rate of a transition between nuclei of type @xmath28 and @xmath29 with energy @xmath30 and @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy distribution of isotropic background photons at redshift @xmath34 and @xmath35 the photon s energy in the rest frame of the nucleus with lorentz boost @xmath36 . besides the contribution of the cmb we use the cosmic infrared / optical background ( cib ) from ref .",

    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) we define the integrated interaction rate @xmath38 and the total interaction rate @xmath39 .    photo - disintegration of nuclei with large mass number @xmath1 is dominated by the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) with main branches @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath23 indicates a proton or neutron  @xcite .",

    "the secondary nuclei with atomic number @xmath45 and @xmath46 inherit the boost of the initial nucleon and lie close to the next gdr at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",

    "mev , where the photon wavelength becomes smaller than the size of the nucleus , the photon can interact via substructures of the nucleus .",
    "out of these the interaction with quasi - deuterons is typically most dominant and forms a plateau of the cross section up to the pion production threshold at @xmath52  mev . we use the reaction code talys  @xcite to evaluate the cross sections @xmath53 of the exclusive processes @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( n stands for p or n ) for nuclides of the psb - chain with @xmath59 . for the cross sections of light nuclei with mass numbers",

    "we refer to the appendices of refs .",
    "@xcite for further details of the calculation .",
    "another important energy loss of uhe cr nuclei is bh pair production via scattering off the crb photons . since this is a coherent process of the nucleons the energy loss scales as @xmath27 where @xmath2 is the charge number of the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "bethe - heitler pair production with differential rate @xmath63 can be treated as a continuous energy loss process with a rate @xmath64 where @xmath22 and @xmath65 are the energies of the nucleus before and after scattering , respectively .",

    "the energy loss length @xmath67 via bh pairs is typically much smaller than the interaction length of resonant photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei , which is of the order of @xmath68  mpc .",
    "hence the primary nuclei will be fully disintegrated within a few mpc .",
    "the light secondaries with small charge per nucleus , like protons and helium , do not exhibit a @xmath27-enhancement",

    "<S> we discuss the prospects of detecting the sources of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic ray ( cr ) nuclei via their emission of cosmogenic @xmath0-rays in the gev to tev energy range . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath0-rays result from electromagnetic cascades initiated by high energy photons , electrons and positrons that are emitted by crs during their propagation in the cosmic radiation background and are independent of the simultaneous emission of @xmath0-rays in the vicinity of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding production power by uhe cr nuclei ( with mass number @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 ) is dominated by pion photo - production ( @xmath3 ) and bethe - heitler pair production ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cosmogenic @xmath0-ray signal from a single steady uhe cr source is typically more robust with respect to variations of the source composition and injection spectrum than the accompanying signal of cosmogenic neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we study the diffuse emission from the sum of extragalactic cr sources as well as the point source emission of the closest sources . </S>"
