    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with infrared luminosity at 81000 @xmath3 m greater than 10@xmath4 @xmath5 ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) are extremely energetic objects in the universe .",
    "although they contribute little to the infrared luminosity density in the local universe due to small numbers , they become cosmologically important at z  @xmath6  1 ( e.g. , le floch et al . 2005 ; magnelli et al .",
    "their enormous infrared luminosity comes from dust heated by hot young stars ( starburst ) , a supermassive black hole rapidly accreting matter ( active galactic nucleus , agn ) , or a mixture of these two ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 and lonsdale et al .",
    "2006 for a review ) .",
    "these starburst and/or agn activities can be triggered by tidal interactions between galaxies and associated shocks ( e.g. , bushouse 1987 ; liu & kennicutt 1995 ; barnes 2004 ) .",
    "in fact , numerous observational and theoretical studies suggested that ulirgs are mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies ( e.g. , clements et al .",
    "1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; veilleux et al .",
    "2002 ; younger et al .",
    "2009 ; hwang et al .",
    "2010a ) , and evolve into quasars ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1988",
    "; dasyra et al . 2006 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ; yuan et al .",
    "2010 ) or intermediate - mass elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "2001 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "to better understand the origin and evolution of ulirgs , it is essential to find out what their primary energy source is .",
    "a standard spectroscopic method to distinguish between starburst and agn is to use so - called bpt diagrams ( baldwin et al .",
    "1981 ) , which are based on optical emission line ratios sensitive to the photoionization source .",
    "this optical diagnostic was revised by veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) and an alternative scheme was proposed by kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in heavily obscured galaxies like ulirgs , additional observations at other wavelengths",
    "are helpful to characterize their dominant energy source ( e.g. , x - ray : franceschini et al .",
    "2003 , teng et al . 2009",
    "; infrared : risaliti et al .",
    "2006 , farrah et al .",
    "2007 , imanishi et al . 2010",
    "; radio : nagar et al . 2003 , sajina et al . 2008 ) . however , it is still difficult to determine the relative contribution of starburst and agn within individual galaxies .",
    "ulirgs were discovered in large numbers by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ; neugebauer et al . 1984 )",
    "and the number of ulirgs increased with the advent of wide - field galaxy redshift surveys ( goto 2005 ; pasquali et al .",
    "2005 ; cao et al .",
    "2006 ; hwang et al .",
    "2007 , 2010a ; hou et al .",
    "however , previous studies based on optical spectra of the large sample are limited to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , which mainly covers the northern hemisphere .",
    "the optical spectral properties of ulirgs in the southern hemisphere remain to be studied .    in this study , we present the analysis of optical spectra for about a hundred southern ulirgs in the catalogue given by hwang et al .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . the survey data and our observations are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 explains the procedures to analyse these data and to classify the ulirgs . in section 4 ,",
    "the results of our study are discussed , and are compared with those of previous studies .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 5 . throughout",
    ", we adopt @xmath7 = 70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and a flat @xmath9cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath10 = 0.3 and @xmath11 = 0.7 .",
    "hwang et al . ( 2007 ) identified 324 ulirgs by cross - correlating the _ iras _ faint source catalogue version 2 ( moshir et al . 1992 ) with the spectroscopic catalogues of galaxies in the fourth data release of sdss ( adelman - mccarthy et al . 2006 . ) , the final data release of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the second data release of the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ; jones et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the spectral types of ulirgs in the sdss among them were determined in hou et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in this study , we focus on 198 ulirgs that were not covered by the sdss but covered by the 2dfgrs and 6dfgs .",
    "we used the optical spectra of these ulirgs available online for 6dfgs , http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/6dfgs/ ] .",
    "the optical spectra of 2dfgrs galaxies were taken with the two - degree field ( 2df ) multi - object spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "this spectrograph has 140 @xmath3 m diameter fibres corresponding to 2.16 at the plate centre and 1.99 at the edge and covers 36008000   with a spectral resolution of @xmath12 9  .",
    "the 6dfgs galaxies were observed with the six - degree field ( 6df ) multi - object spectrograph having 6.7 diameter fibres on the united kingdom schmidt telescope .",
    "the original grating in the 6dfgs spectrograph spans 40008400 and gives a resolution of 512  .",
    "the improved grating , used after 2002 october , spans 39007500   with a resolution of 4.96.6  .",
    "it is noted that the 2dfgrs and 6dfgs spectra are not properly flux - calibrated , but the flux ratio of adjacent lines is still useful ( to be discussed in section 4 ) .",
    "in addition , we conducted optical spectroscopy of 15 ulirgs in the survey sample plus one ulirg , _ iras _ 09022@xmath23615 , in sanders et al .",
    "( 2003 ) at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the total number of our ulirg sample with spectra was increased to 199 .",
    "the additional ulirgs were observed on 2008 february 2021 with the ritchey - chretien spectrograph and the loral 3k ccd at the ctio 4-m telescope ( 0.5 pixel@xmath8 ) . a slit with a width of 1.5 ( a slightly larger than the seeing size ) was adopted , and was positioned in the east - west direction ( p.a .",
    "we used 316 lines mm@xmath8 grating to cover the spectral range 450010500 with a resolution of 5.6   ( @xmath12 2.8 pixels ) .",
    "three exposures were taken for each object and the integration times ranged from 360 to 3000 seconds depending on its brightness .",
    "data reduction was performed using the iraf package .",
    "this involved bias subtraction , flat fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "galaxy spectra were extracted using an aperture width corresponding to a constant linear scale of 5 kpc at the redshift of each galaxy . a he - ne - ar lamp and standard star hiltner 600 ( massey et al .",
    "1988 ) taken nightly were used for wavelength and flux calibration , respectively . in fig . 1 , we display 13 spectra with median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel for the continuum greater than 3 . typical emission lines",
    "( , @xmath13 , + @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ) are clearly seen in most spectra .    among the sample of 199 ulirgs considered in this study , we analyse the spectra of 115 ulirgs with continuum s / n @xmath6 3 . in the case",
    "that there are more than one spectrum for the same object , the spectrum with a higher s / n of  flux is chosen for the final classification .",
    "if  is not available from any spectra , the spectrum with a higher s / n of  flux has priority .",
    "after transforming the spectrum to the rest - frame and subtracting the local continuum defined by a linear fit around emission - lines , we measure the line widths and fluxes via gaussian profile fit using the mpfit / idl package based on the levenberg - marquardt method ( markwardt 2009 ) .",
    "a single gaussian is used to obtain the line width of @xmath0 . for the line",
    "fluxes , we fit the @xmath16 line , @xmath15 doublet , + @xmath14 and + @xmath13 line complexes with one gaussian , two gaussians , four gaussians , and six gaussians , respectively .",
    "the widths of the  doublet are kept the same and the height ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath18 is fixed to 1/3 , as required by the energy level structure of the  ion ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "the  doublet is fitted in the same way but each of the  lines is modelled with two gaussians because  line often has a blue , asymmetric wing that is perhaps from outflows of gas with opaque clouds ( e.g. , heckman et al 1981 ; greene & ho 2005 ) .",
    "some agn host galaxies show both narrow and broad balmer lines ( e.g. , osterbrock & mathews 1986 ; hao et al . 2005 ) and the narrow balmer lines can have extended bases even in star - forming galaxies , which are probably due to wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , osterbrook & cohen 1982 ; brinchmann et al . 2008 ) . to take this into account",
    ", we fit each balmer line with two gaussians .",
    "if the +  line complex can not be decomposed into individual lines , the line fluxes are not kept .",
    "meanwhile , the decomposition of  doublet is not important because we are interested only in the total flux of the lines .",
    "uncertainties in the line measurements , comes from mpfit routine , are typically 1030 per cent .",
    "we correct the line fluxes for galactic extinction using the foreground reddening maps provided by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "balmer emission lines can be strongly affected by stellar absorption features .",
    "we remove the stellar absorption effects following the method discussed in hopkins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the stellar absorption - corrected line flux , @xmath21 is the measured line flux after foreground reddening correction , @xmath22 is the equivalent width of the line , and @xmath23 is a correction factor .",
    "we adopted @xmath23 values ( 2.6 and 3.2   for  and , respectively ) of sc type galaxies ( miller & owen 2002 ) .",
    "if both  and  are measured , we can correct the line fluxes for internal extinction using the balmer decrement and the extinction curve with an assumption of an intrinsic /  line ratio of 2.85 for star - forming galaxies and 3.1 for agn galaxies ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "we do not apply this correction when the observed ratio is smaller than the theoretical value .",
    "an observed line width is the convolution of intrinsic line width and instrumental response .",
    "since the instrumental resolution of each survey is significantly different , the observed line width should be corrected for a fair comparison . to correct the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath0 line using the quadrature method",
    ", we adopt 250 km s@xmath8 as a finite resolution of ctio spectra .",
    "then we determine that the resolutions are roughly 450 , 600 , and 400 km s@xmath8 for the 2dfgrs , original 6dfgs , and improved 6dfgs grating , respectively , by considering that the  lines from different spectra have the same intrinsic width .",

    "for reliable classification , it is suggested to use an aperture covering more than @xmath12 20% of the galaxy light .",
    "the minimum aperture covering fraction of 20% corresponds to 2.1 kpc ( see fig . 6 in kewley et al .",
    "all spectra of ulirgs in this study satisfy this condition .",
