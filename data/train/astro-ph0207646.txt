    "in this work we use all available data from rxte s pca to simultaneously study the spectral and timing properties in the transient low mass x - ray binary 4u 160852 .",

    "it has been recently proposed @xcite that the atoll sources trace out similar three ",

    "as a first step we go through the data in chronological order and look at the timing properties ( per observation ) and the position of the source in the color  color diagram . the obtained lightcurve and color  color diagram for 4u 160852 can be grouped into 3 parts .",
    "the first part ranges from 1996 march 3 to december 28 ( the decay of the 1996 outburst , see @xcite ) , the second part from 1998 february 3 to september 29 ( the 1998 outburst , see @xcite ) and the third part from 2000 march 6 to may 10 . in practice most data",
    "was available for the second part of the lightcurve ( the 1998 outburst ) so we will present the results for the second part of the lightcurve first .",
    "the results can then serve as a template for the rest of the data .    for the 1998 outburst",
    "we find 7 different color diagram position / power spectral classes and we can confirm the result of @xcite that the color  color diagram shows the classical atoll c shape ( see @xcite ) . for the decay of the 1996 outburst",
    "we find one additional class that was different from those observed during the 1998 outburst .",
    "the color  color diagram deviates from the c shape and if we sort the classes by characteristic frequency , the color  color diagram seems to follow an @xmath2 shape instead of the classical atoll shape ( see also below ) .",
    "in the third part of the data the source countrates were low and in most cases it was impossible to identify any power spectral features , therefore the classification for this part of the data was solely done on position in the color  color diagram .",
    "to improve the statistics of the power spectra we add up all the continuous time intervals in each of the 8 classes . to avoid doubling of the lower kilohertz qpo peak we split the class marked with the filled circles up into three parts depending on lower kilohertz qpo frequency . in figure",
    "[ fig : cc_int ] we show the resulting 10 intervals marked from a to j in the color  color diagram .",
    "+    we fit the power density spectrum of each interval of figure [ fig : cc_int ] with the multi ",
    "lorentzian fit function . in figure",
    "[ fig : freq_freq ] we show the characteristic frequencies of the lorentzians used to fit the power spectra of 4u 160852 plotted versus the characteristic frequency of the lorentzian identified as the upper kilohertz qpo , together with the results of @xcite for 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "the results of the multi ",
    "lorentzian fit to 4u 160852 are remarkably similar to those of 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "interval c in figure [ fig : cc_int ] represents a deviation from the classical atoll shape ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "according to the interpretation of @xcite and @xcite interval c would represent the analogon to the horizontal branch of the z sources .",
    "as in z sources the characteristic frequencies of the timing features increase along the z starting at the horizontal branch , the measured frequencies in c should then be lower than those in a and b. instead we find that all characteristic frequencies clearly increase from a to j so that the frequencies in c are intermediate between those in b and d. this is not consistent with the idea that 4u 1608 - 52 traces out a three - branched z shape in the color - color diagram ,",
