    "the report by drozdov , eremets , and troyan@xcite ( det ) of superconductivity up to t@xmath4=190 k in h@xmath5s compressed to the 200 gpa regime has reignited excitement in the possibility of achieving room temperature superconductivity .",
    "this report builds on previous success of pressure enhancement of t@xmath4 in a variety of types of materials : from 134k to 164k in the cuprate hg2223,@xcite from zero to 20 - 25 k in the simple metals li , ca , and y , [ ] and from zero to 14k in the insulator silicon.@xcite an anticipated major factor is the increase in the phonon energy scale with compression , since it sets the temperature scale for t@xmath4 , as pointed out early on@xcite and reviewed more recently@xcite by ashcroft in predicting possible room temperature superconductivity in metallic hydrogen .",
    "the newly reported high values of t@xmath4 appear to confirm theoretical predictions that predated the experiment . applying particle swarm crystal structure search techniques founded on density functional theory , li _ et al . _",
    "predicted@xcite candidate stable crystal structures of h@xmath5s up to 220 gpa .",
    "these predictions were followed by linear response calculations of the phonon spectrum @xmath6 , electron - phonon matrix elements , and finally the eliashberg spectral function @xmath7 , from which t@xmath4 can be calculated , depending only mildly on the presumed value of the retarded coulomb repulsion @xmath8 = 0.10 - 0.13 . for pressures of 140 - 180 gpa",
    ", they obtained an electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath9=1.0 - 1.2 , an allen - dynes characteristic frequency@xcite @xmath10@xmath111000k , and t@xmath4 of 40k at 140 gpa and peaking at 80 k at 160 gpa . while 80k is well short of the reported t@xmath4=190k , the result is convincing that very high t@xmath4",
    "is predicted in h@xmath5s at high pressure .",
    "the sister stoichiometry h@xmath1s has been explored in very similar fashion by duan _",
    "et al._@xcite predicting structures to more than 200 gpa , their linear response results for @xmath0 h@xmath1s led to very large calculated values of electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath9=2.0 - 2.2 , frequency scales @xmath121300k , and values of t@xmath4 up to 200k . in the calculations of li _",
    "et al . _ and duan _ et al .",
    "_ , the high values of @xmath10 are expected from the anticipated increase of force constants as volume is decreased .",
    "the large values of @xmath9 , a factor of two or more over most other very good superconductors ( including mgb@xmath5 ) , imply that the electronic matrix elements are substantially larger than in nearly all known conventional superconductors .",
    "in this report we use gaspari - gyorffy ( gg ) theory@xcite to provide insight into why electron - ion matrix elements vary , and evidently increase strongly , with pressure .",
    "such understanding is necessary not only to interpret the results described above , but also to provide essential clues how to increase matrix elements , and @xmath9 , at lower or possibly ambient pressure .",
    "interestingly , shortly after the formulation of this theory , two of the present authors applied it to predict t@xmath4@xmath11250k in metallic hydrogen at a few mbar pressure.@xcite    gg theory@xcite builds on the earlier observation of hopfield@xcite that electron scattering off ( moving ) ions has strong local character .",
    "first , metallic screening means the thomas - fermi screening length is short , of the order of 1   , and very weakly dependent on carrier density ( more correctly , the fermi level density of states [ dos ] n(e@xmath13 ) ) .",
    "gg employed a multiple scattering green s function formalism that facilitated three simplifications .",
    "the first is that the potential is spherical ( very good approximation ) and is negligible beyond the atomic sphere ; the second is that the linear change in potential of a displaced ion can be approximated by a rigid shift of the atomic potential .",
    "thirdly , the direction dependence of the wavefunction coefficients is averaged out , thereby neglecting any special influence of fermi surface shape .",
    "the h@xmath1s fermi surface@xcite is large and multisheeted , minimizing the likelihood of fermi surface effects .",
    "it is possible that these approximations may improve with reduction in volume , in any case these approximations should not degrade as the system become denser .",
    "the bands shown by duan _ et al._@xcite and bernstein _",
    "et al._@xcite for the @xmath0 structure of h@xmath1s that we discuss show much free electron , spherical character in the lower 75% of the occupied bands , though less so around the fermi energy where s @xmath14 - h @xmath15 hybridization produces structure in the dos .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath9 , and the frequency weighting spectrum @xmath16 normalized to unity , are given in eliashberg theory@xcite by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the eliashberg electron - phonon spectral function that governs many superconducting properties .",
    "the calculations by li _",
    "et al . _ for h@xmath5s and duan _ et al . _ for h@xmath1s",
    "demonstrate that the lower range of phonon frequencies ( the acoustic modes ) have negligible h character , while the optic modes above the gap at 20 - 25 thz have negligible s character , making it an ideal platform for applying the gg expression to the atoms _",
    "thus @xmath19 , where the latter arise from the integral over the low frequency s modes , the former from the nine higher frequency h branches . in this case the gg expression , given originally for an elemental solid , can be applied to the s and h spheres separately.@xcite each atomic ( @xmath20 ) coupling constant @xmath21 is given by the integral over the appropriate frequency region , leading to @xmath22 the averaged matrix elements @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 obtained from gg theory are discussed below .",
    "the separation of mode character also allows a simple estimate of the total frequency moments that enter the allen - dynes ( ad ) equation for t@xmath4 , through the weight function @xmath26/(\\lambda_s + 3\\lambda_h),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the partial @xmath27 functions , defined analogously to that of ad ( eq . [ eqn1 ] ) are separately normalized to unity .    both h@xmath5s and h@xmath1s having been shown@xcite to have strong electron - phonon coupling at high pressure .",
    "et al._@xcite have provided convincing evidence that h@xmath5s is unstable to decomposition into bcc h@xmath1s and sulfur , and that competing stoichiometries are unlikely .",
    "this result confirms the suggestion of det , who reported sulfur formation in their samples . because of this evidence on the most likely superconducting phase , we focus on @xmath0 h@xmath1s with its simple @xmath28 structure based in two interlaced reo@xmath1 structure sublattices . from @xmath18 of duan _",
    ", we simplify with a constant @xmath29 ( constant for each atom species @xmath20 ) with frequency ranges ( in kelvin ) of [ 430,820 ] for s and [ 1250,2500 ] for h. results are insensitive to these limits , depending mostly on the mean frequencies and the separation of @xmath9 into s and h contributions .",
    "the resulting frequency moments @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and associated data , for insight into separate s and h contribution , for use in the ad equation,@xcite and to compare with results below from gg theory , are presented in table  [ duantable ] .    with @xmath8=0.15 ,",
    "t@xmath4=234 k results ; the difference from the value quoted by duan _ et al",
    ". _ might be due to neglect of the strong coupling factor @xmath32=1.13 factor in the ad equation , which amounts to a 26 k increase , or partially to our constant @xmath18 modeling . neglecting the contribution from the s modes , @xmath9",
    "is decreased from 2.2 to 1.5 but @xmath10 increases from 1500 k to 1770 k , and t@xmath4 decreases by only 19 k to 215 k. the sulfur contribution to t@xmath4 is 8% ; h@xmath1s is basically an atomic hydrogen high temperature superconductor .",
    "et al . _ also suggested that s vibrations are not essential for the high t@xmath4 .",
    "the h isotope effect can also be obtained .",
    "@xmath9 is unaffected by masses ; @xmath33 is a function of the force constants alone , so frequencies , specifically @xmath34 decrease as the square root of the mass .",
    "the resulting critical temperature is reduced to @xmath11170 k , slightly more than 234 k/@xmath35 because the small s contribution remains unchanged .",
    "the experimental value of det@xcite is 90 k ; the most likely cause of this discrepancy is strong anharmonicity of the h optic modes .",
    "the second moment frequency at 200 gpa of s is @xmath36=615 k , while that of h is @xmath37=1840 k , thus with the atomic masses of 32 and 1 a.m.u respectively , the denominator @xmath38 is 32/9 = 3.5 larger for s. the consequence is that a given contribution to @xmath39 is 3.5@xmath403@xmath1110 times more effective in increasing @xmath9 than the same contribution to @xmath41 ( though in practice there is no clear method of effecting such a tradeoff ) .",
    ".electron - phonon coupling data for h@xmath1s , obtained from modeling the results of duan _ et al . _ with a constant @xmath18 model .",
    "frequencies are in kelvin . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ bigtable ]    as noted above from our analysis of the results of duan _ et al .",
    "_ , the sulfur contribution is less important . as for h",
    ", the increase in @xmath42 occurs in spite of a _ decrease _ in the @xmath43 factor , by 30% from p=100 to p=300 gpa . over this pressure range ,",
    "the pdos ratio product @xmath44 increases by 75% , giving a net @xmath42 increase by more than 50% .",
    "in addition , the s @xmath45 and even @xmath46 channels begin to contribute , reaching 20% of the total of @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 at 300 gpa .",
    "thus the increase is a composite effect of increase of both @xmath3 and @xmath47 character of s , which is reflected also in the growing phase shifts of these channels .",
    "these transfers of atomic character under pressure are consistent with general expectations of the evolution of atomic character under reduction of volume . interpolating to 200 gpa to obtain @xmath41=5.84 ev / @xmath48 , @xmath39=1.71 ev / @xmath48 ( which must be multiplied by three ) , and using the frequency moments from table 1 , we obtain @xmath9=2.6 , thus t@xmath49 depending somewhat on the chosen value of @xmath8=0.10 - 0.13 .",
    "this value is very consistent with the value of t@xmath4 ( above ) obtained from our modeling of the duan data .",
    "though the numbers might vary for other low - z hydrides ( h@xmath50p , h@xmath50b , ... ) the lack of any special role of s in these results suggests there should also be a strong increase in t@xmath4 with pressure in other low - z element hydrides .",
    "a question of great interest is whether t@xmath4 increases further at higher pressure .",
    "the data presented in table  [ bigtable ] provides the pressure dependence of the important quantities entering @xmath41 and @xmath39 .",
    "this data demonstrates that the strongest contributions arise for sulfur from the @xmath51 channel and for hydrogen from the @xmath52 channel .",
    "note that for h one should multiply by three to account for the three h atoms in the unit cell .    since @xmath53 dominates the sulfur contribution , we can focus on the h contribution alone .",
    "the total pressure derivative contains several contributions @xmath54 where @xmath32 is the strong coupling correction and @xmath55 is the exponential term in the allen - dynes equation .",
    "the pressure variation of the @xmath56 denominator is challenging to approximate without full calculations of the spectrum and @xmath18 .",
    "we have modeled the variation of the h spectrum by assuming the three 3-fold @xmath57 point optic modes are representative .",
    "the lower two of these modes are ir - active involving h - s bond stretch and bond bending modes , the hardest frequency is a silent mode with quadrupolar h motion with respect to s.    from calculations of these @xmath57 frequencies in the 240 - 270 gpa range using the elk code we calculate a positive but modest pressure increase @xmath58@xmath591.9@xmath4010@xmath60 gpa@xmath61 . from fig .",
    "[ i2eta ] we obtain @xmath62=3.5@xmath4010@xmath60 gpa@xmath61 , thus @xmath9 decreases with pressure approximately as @xmath63@xmath11 - 0.3@xmath4010@xmath60/gpa .",
    "however , to our precision this is indistinguishable from zero , so the pressure derivative in eq .",
    "[ eqn5 ] reduces to the first term , the frequency derivative .",
    "the resulting prediction is a small increase @xmath64=0.4 k / gpa .",
    "this result disagrees in sign with duan _",
    "et al . _ , who quoted a smaller ( in magnitude ) negative value of @xmath64=-0.12 k / gpa from direct calculation , however both numbers are small compared to the large value of t@xmath4 itself , so there is no significant disagreement .",
    "the report by drozdov , eremets , and troyan of t@xmath4 up to 190 k in h@xmath50s samples has breathed new life into the 50 year old expectation of high t@xmath4 in atomic h systems . both li _ et al .",
    "_ and duan _ et al .",
    "_ had found that eliashberg theory and linear response results for electron - phonon coupling account for t@xmath4 in the 80 - 200 k range for h@xmath5s and h@xmath1s at high pressure , and the analysis of bernstein _ et al _ make @xmath0 h@xmath1s the primary candidate to be this record - high temperature superconductor . in this paper",
    "we have established that the coupling of h vibrations increases strongly for pressures up to and even beyond 210 gpa , and that 90+% of the coupling arises from h vibrations in this hydride that is stabilized by hybridization@xcite with s. this picture is analogous to the finding of the essential contribution of h in the superconductor pdh at ambient pressure,@xcite and the broader picture of ashcroft@xcite of superconducting elemental h at high pressure .",
    "the theoretical isotope shift of t@xmath4 based on the harmonic approximation is not in agreement with the experimental result , suggesting substantial h anharmonicity will be necessary to understand before the picture is complete .",
    "our picture , which relies on coupling across the large fermi surface , is at odds with the hole superconductivity picture of hirsch and marsiglio.@xcite      the authors acknowledge many insightful conversations on the theory and application of gg theory with the late b. l. gyrffy , to whom we dedicate this paper .",
