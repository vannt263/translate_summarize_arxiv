    "recently , the compass collaboration at cern observed a narrow @xmath19 signal in the @xmath20 channel , and identified a new @xmath21 state with mass @xmath22 mev and width @xmath23 mev  @xcite . including @xmath24 , @xmath9 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , there are as many as six @xmath21 states of quantum numbers @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , which is much richer compared with conventional quark model predictions .",
    "moreover , this new @xmath9 state was observed in the @xmath20 channel , suggesting that @xmath9 has a large @xmath29 component , since @xmath30 is usually interpreted as a @xmath31 molecule , diquark - antidiquark tetraquark , or other models with an @xmath29 component  @xcite . in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite used the diquark - antidiquark model to interpret the light scalar meson spectrum .",
    "accordingly , @xmath9 can be an exotic multiquark state , which makes it quite an interesting subject .",
    "to date , there are only a few theoretical studies of @xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was interpreted as an axial - vector two - quark - tetraquark mixed state using qcd sum rule methods , but the analysis is incomplete because it did not include the interference terms in the calculation of the mixed correlator . ref .",
    "@xcite interpreted the @xmath32 as a dynamical effect due to the singularity in the triangle diagrams formed by the processes @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it was also briefly discussed using lattice qcd in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper we shall study the @xmath9 state in the framework of qcd sum rules , which has proven to be a successful and powerful nonperturbative method over the past few decades  @xcite .",
    "we shall systematically construct local interpolating tetraquark currents of @xmath0 , and classify them into types @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively based on antisymmetric , symmetric , and mixed flavor symmetries of diquarks and antidiquarks .",

    "we shall find a tetraquark current with quark contents @xmath5 ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , which leads to a mass result consistent with the @xmath9 state observed by the compass collaboration  @xcite .",

    "the flavor structure of light tetraquarks is @xmath36 where the subscripts @xmath1 , @xmath37 and @xmath2 denote that the diquarks and antidiquarks inside have antisymmetric , mixed - symmetric and symmetric flavor structures , respectively .",
    "the tetraquark currents of @xmath38 have been constructed in ref .",
    "now we need to take the charge - conjugation parity into account in order to construct tetraquark currents of @xmath0 .",
    "the charge - conjugation transformation changes diquarks into antidiquarks , and vice versa , while keeping their flavor symmetries unchanged .",
    "therefore , tetraquark currents themselves can have definite charge - conjugation parities when the diquark and antidiquark fields inside have a symmetric flavor structure @xmath39 ( @xmath2 ) or an antisymmetric flavor structure @xmath40 ( @xmath1 ) .",

    ", the current @xmath4 contains quark content @xmath79 and so does not have @xmath80 . to be isovector , it should have quark content @xmath81 , while its isoscalar partner should have quark content @xmath82",
    ". however , we do not study effects of isospin breaking in this paper , i.e. , we work in the limit of @xmath83 isospin symmetry and ignore the difference between up and down quarks , such as their masses and the quark condensates @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , isospin - violating effects from instantons , which are important in the scalar channels  @xcite , are suppressed for the vector channel under consideration .",
    "accordingly , the qcd sum rule results for these two currents with quark contents @xmath86 and @xmath87 are both the same as the result for @xmath4 with quark contents @xmath79 and similarly for the other currents listed above .",
    "this suggests that we would obtain the same sum rule for an isovector tetraquark current of @xmath0 and its isoscalar partner of @xmath88 , which would consequently result in the same mass result for the relevant isovector state and its isoscalar partner .",

    "@xcite for detailed discussions , where all mass curves have a minimum around 1.5 - 1.6 gev against the threshold value @xmath100 ) .",
    "one conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that these tetraquark currents couple to the @xmath25 state .",
    "recently , a new @xmath9 state was observed , with mass @xmath22 mev and width @xmath23 mev  @xcite .",
    "the masses of these two states are not far from each other , so that if a current couples to both of them and we still use a one - pole parametrization ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) below and related discussion ) , a prediction between these two masses would be obtained for this single pole model .",
    "this may be the reason why the mass prediction 1.51.6 gev is obtained in ref .",
    "to better understand the properties of @xmath9 , we need to differentiate it from @xmath25 . to do",
    "this one can either adopt a two - pole parametrization , or use a current mainly coupling to @xmath9 .",
    "the former is impractical because one needs detailed phenomenological models for such closely - spaced resonances , so in this paper we shall try the latter approach .",
    "considering that only tetraquark currents of types @xmath1 and @xmath2 were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall use tetraquark currents of type @xmath3 , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , to perform qcd sum rule analyses and check whether such a current exists or not .",
    "we assume that they couple to the @xmath21 state of @xmath0 through @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the decay constant .",
    "we consider the following two - point correlation function @xmath105 in which @xmath106 is an interpolating current carrying the same quantum numbers as the hadron state we want to study . because @xmath106 is not a conserved current , there are two different lorentz structures in @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 related to spin-1 and spin-0 states , respectively .    the two - point function @xmath110 can be calculated in the qcd operator product expansion ( ope ) up to certain order in the expansion , which is then matched with a hadronic parametrization to extract information about hadron properties . to do this ,",
    "we express eq .",
    "( [ def : pi ] ) at the hadron level as @xmath111 where we have used the form of the dispersion relation with a spectral function with @xmath112 denoting the physical threshold .",
    "we can write the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : disper ] ) as @xmath113 as usual , we adopt a parametrization of one - pole dominance for the ground state and a continuum contribution , but note that the masses of @xmath9 and @xmath25 are not far from each other so that it may be more reasonable to adopt a two - pole parametrization , which is , however , impractical because one needs detailed phenomenological models for such closely - spaced resonances . after performing borel transform at both the hadron and qcd levels ,",
    "the two - point correlation function can be expressed as @xmath114 finally , we assume that the contribution from the continuum states can be approximated well by the ope spectral density above a threshold value @xmath100 ( duality ) , and arrive at the sum rule relation which can be used to perform numerical analyses . here",
    "we again use the current @xmath115 as an example , whose quark contents are @xmath116 .",
    "we assume it couples to the @xmath21 state through eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) , and the obtained sum rule relation is listed in eq . .",
    "the results for other currents are shown in appendix .",
    "[ app : ope ] .",

    "the vacuum saturation for higher dimensional condensates are assumed as usual , such as @xmath125 .",
    "we have neglected the chirally suppressed contributions from current up and down quark masses because they are numerically insignificant .",
    "moreover , we consider only leading - order contributions of @xmath126 from the two - gluon condensate ( @xmath127 ) because the terms containing quark - related condensates are found to be significantly larger than those containing gluon - related condensates .    to study the convergence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ope5 m ] ) , we use the following values for various condensates  @xcite : @xmath128 note that there is a minus sign implicitly included in the definition of the coupling constant @xmath129 in this work .",
    "we find that the @xmath130 and @xmath131 terms are dominant power corrections , while the @xmath132 and @xmath133 terms are much smaller .",
    "actually , the @xmath130 and @xmath131 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ope5 m ] ) are mainly contributed by the condensates @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , our first criterion is to require that the @xmath132 and @xmath133 terms be less than 10% : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the sum of the @xmath132 and @xmath133 terms .",
    "we show this in the left panel of fig .",

    "our second criterion is to require that the pole contribution be larger than 10% ( see discussions below for the limitation 20% ) : @xmath142 we note that the pole contribution is usually quite small in the multi - quark sum rule analyses due to the large powers of @xmath65 in the spectral function .",

    "this criterion has a limitation on the borel mass that @xmath143 gev@xmath140 .",
    "finally we obtain the working region of borel mass @xmath144 gev@xmath145 gev@xmath140 for the current @xmath146 with the continuum threshold @xmath147 gev@xmath140 .",
    "our final expression for the mass of the @xmath21 state is obtained via : @xmath148 in which @xmath100 is the continuum threshold . to choose a reasonable value of @xmath100",

    "[ fig : current5 ] , in a large region 1.5 gev@xmath150 gev@xmath140 .",
    "we find that the dependence of the mass curves with respect to the borel parameter @xmath151 is very weak when the continuum threshold @xmath100 is chosen to be around 2.5 gev@xmath140 , which is thus a reasonable value of @xmath100 to give a reliable mass prediction .",
    "the variation of @xmath149 with respect to the borel mass @xmath138 is shown in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : current5 ] , in a large region 0.5 gev@xmath152 gev@xmath140 .",
    "the mass curves increase quickly with @xmath151 from 0.5 gev@xmath140 to 1.0 gev@xmath140 , but they are quite stable against @xmath151 as it continues increasing from 1 gev@xmath140 .",
    "this suggests that the limitation of the second criterion , eq .",
    "( [ eq_pole ] ) , can be slightly modified to be 20% , and then the mass obtained is almost the same , but with a much narrower working region .",
    "finally , we choose @xmath153 gev@xmath154 gev@xmath140 and use the borel window @xmath144 gev@xmath145 gev@xmath140 as our working region resulting in the following numerical results @xmath155 where the central values correspond to @xmath147 gev@xmath140 and @xmath156 gev@xmath140 .",
    "the errors come from the uncertainties of @xmath100 , @xmath151 and the various parameters in eq .  .",

    "one notes that the central - value masses obtained in eqs .   and for the non - strange @xmath175 tetraquarks are heavier than those in eqs .   and for the strange - flavor @xmath176 tetraquarks .",
    "this counter - intuitive behavior also appears in the scalar meson sector , where the isovector @xmath177 is a bit heavier than the strange isospinor @xmath178  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that the dominant sources of theoretical uncertainty in the qcd input parameters eq .",
    "are uncorrelated in the strange and non - strange cases , and hence we can not rule out a near degeneracy from our mass predictions .",
    "the sum rules using the currents @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 do not have reasonable working regions to give reliable mass results .",

    "the sum rules using the latter two currents lead to mass results around 1.8 gev .",
    "in summary , we have systematically constructed tetraquark currents of @xmath0 .",
    "these currents can be classified into types @xmath1 ( anti - symmetric ) , @xmath2 ( symmetric ) and @xmath3 ( mixed structure ) , based on flavor symmetries of diquarks and antidiquarks .",
    "tetraquark currents of types @xmath1 and @xmath2 had been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in this paper we have used the tetraquark currents of type @xmath3 to perform qcd sum rule analyses and investigated the newly observed @xmath9 state .    combining the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the results obtained in this paper , we found that a mass prediction around 1.51.6 gev is often obtained ( with respect to the threshold value @xmath100 ) .",
    "this may be a reasonable result : there are two @xmath21 states , @xmath9 and @xmath25 , whose masses are close to each other , so that if a current couples to both of them and one still uses a one - pole parametrization , a mass value between these two masses would be obtained for this single pole .",
    "however , in the absence of definitive phenomenological models it is impractical to develop a two - pole parametrization that differentiates @xmath9 from @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we have used another approach , i.e. , finding a current mainly coupling to @xmath9 .",
    "we have used tetraquark currents of type @xmath3 to perform qcd sum rule analyses , and found that the current @xmath4 leads to a mass of @xmath8 gev .",
    "the good agreement of this result with the experimental value suggests that this current couples to the @xmath9 state supporting a tetraquark interpretation .",
    "we note that the quark content @xmath79 of the current @xmath4 means that it does not have a definite value of isospin(i.e , it is neither isospin one nor isospin zero ) .",
    "the isovector tetraquark current and its isoscalar partner can be constructed by changing the quark contents to be @xmath183 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "however , the same sum rule and mass prediction would be obtained for all these three currents under @xmath83 isospin symmetry . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is another isoscalar state , @xmath10 , which has been well established in experiments  @xcite .",
    "it strongly couples to @xmath184 , and is likely to be the isoscalar partner of @xmath9 .",
    "if this is the case , our analyses would support tetraquark explanations for both of them .    to conclude this paper",
    ", we study the possible decay channels of @xmath9 . to do this",
