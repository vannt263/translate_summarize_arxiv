    "stochastic processes with an absorbing state arise frequently in statistical physics @xcite , epidemiology @xcite , and related fields .",
    "on one hand we have autocatalytic processes ( in lasers , chemical reactions , or surface catalysis , for example ) , and population models ( in genetic or epidemiological modeling ) , in which a population of @xmath4 individuals goes permanently extinct when the absorbing state , @xmath5 , is reached .",
    "on the other hand , phase transitions to an absorbing state in spatially extended systems , exemplified by the contact process @xcite , are currently of great interest in connection with self - organized criticality @xcite , the transition to turbulence @xcite , and , more generally , issues of universality in nonequilibrium critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "such models are fequently studied using deterministic mean - field equations , monte carlo simulation , and renormalization group analyses .",
    "while fluctuations play an essential role in the vicinity of the absorbing state , exact solution of the master equation is not , in general , feasible .",
    "a useful tool in this situation is van kampen s @xmath6-expansion in inverse powers of the system size , about the deterministic , macroscopic solution .",
    "it is clearly desirable to develop additional methods for analyzing processes with absorbing states . in this work",
    "we study models whose macroscopic equation admits a nonabsorbing ( or _ active _ ) stationary state , but which , for a finite system size , must always end up in the absorbing state .",
    "we show that the _ quasi - stationary _",
    "distribution for such a system is readily constructed , and that it provides a wealth of information about its behavior .",
    "in fact , simulations of  stationary \" properties of lattice models with an absorbing state actually study the quasi - stationary regime , since the only true stationary state ( for a finite system ) is the absorbing one .    for models without spatial structure , such as uniformly distributed populations ,",
    "well stirred chemical reactors , or networks in which each node communicates equally with all others , our results provide a complete description of long - time properties , conditioned on survival . in models with spatial structure , typified by nearest - neighbor interactions on a lattice , as in the contact process",
    ", the description in terms of one or a few variables corresponds to a mean - field theory that can not adequately capture critical fluctuations .",
    "our approach does , nonetheless , allow one to put some of the fluctations ",
    "back into \" mean - field theory , and so we are able to study finite size effects and moment ratios that are beyond the grasp of simpler approaches . for one - step models involving a single variable ,",
    "the computational demands of our approach are trivial ; more complicated processes can be analyzed using straightforward numerical procedures .",
    "the idea of the quasi - stationary state or distribution is quite simple .",
    "consider a markov chain @xmath7 in continuous time , with @xmath5 absorbing , and such that the macroscopic or rate - equation description ( i.e. , neglecting fluctuations ) admits an active stationary state ( @xmath8 ) . then in many cases one expects the probability distribution @xmath9 to bifurcate , after some initial transient , into two components , one with all weight on the absorbing state , the other , @xmath10 , concentrated near the macroscopic value @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the survival probability ( for the process not to have fallen into the absorbing state ) , is @xmath14 .",
    "we study the case in which @xmath15 has attained a time - independent form , in which its only time dependence is through the overall factor @xmath16 . since the probability distribution is supposed to bifurcate , we may write    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , and by definition , @xmath19 . the quasi - stationary distribution ( qs ) is then defined via the condition :    @xmath20    where the @xmath21 are time independent .",
    "( again , @xmath22 . )",
    "since @xmath23 is the survival probability we have the normalization :    @xmath24    clearly , not every process with an absorbing state admits a qs distribution . the exponential decay process ( with transition rates @xmath25 ) and the birth - and - death process ( @xmath26 ) , for example , do not .",
    "while we will not try to determine rigorously the conditions under which a qs distribution exists , it seems reasonable to suppose that the macroscopic equation for the process in question admits an active stationary solution .",
    "all of the examples considered satisfy this condition .",
    "the voter model represents a special case , in which the macroscopic equation provides no information on the fate of the process , and the qs distribution bears no resemblance to the stationary ( absorbing ) distribution .    the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we illustrate the evaluation of the qs distribution , and the analysis of associated statistical properties , for the simple case of the contact process on a complete graph . sec .",
    "3 is concerned with the closely related malthus - verhulst process ( mvp ) .",
    "both the contract process and the mvp exhibit a continuous phase transition in the infinite - size limit . in secs . 4 and 5 we study a models with a discontinuous phase transition : the second schlgl process , and the voter model",
    "6 we return to the contact process , this time in a two - site approximation , and in sec .",
    "7 study a pair of competing mvps .",
    "8 contains a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in the contact process ( cp ) @xcite , each site of a lattice is either occupied ( @xmath27 ) , or vacant ( @xmath28 ) . transitions from @xmath29 to @xmath30 occur at a rate of unity , independent of the neighboring sites .",
    "the reverse can only occur if at least one neighbor is occupied : the transition from @xmath30 to @xmath29 occurs at a rate of @xmath31 , where @xmath2 is the fraction of nearest neighbors of site @xmath32 that are occupied ; thus the state @xmath30 for all @xmath32 is absorbing .",
    "the stationary order parameter @xmath33 ( the fraction of occupied sites ) , is zero for @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to show that in mean - field approximation ( i.e. , treating occupancy of sites as statistically independent events , and supposing that the density @xmath35 is spatially uniform ) , the density follows the rate equation :    @xmath36    this equation predicts a continuous phase transition ( from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in the stationary state ) at @xmath39 . while this is qualitatively correct , @xmath40 is in general larger than 1 ; @xmath41 in one dimension , for example .    a mean - field description such as eq . ( [ cpmft ] )",
    "does not , of course , yield correct critical exponents for dimension @xmath42 , but that is not of concern here . instead",
    ", we would like to study the simplest stochastic process for which eq .",
    "( [ cpmft ] ) represents the macroscopic limit , ( i.e. , the limit of an infinite system , in which @xmath35 is a deterministic variable ) . by studying such a process",
    "we can recover the fluctuations ignored in the macroscopic equation .",
    "since the process has an absorbing state , its limiting ( @xmath43 ) distribution is trivial ( @xmath44 ) , but we can study the long - time properties , conditioned on survival , using the qs distribution .    the stochastic birth - and - death process whose macroscopic limit is given by eq .",
    "( [ cpmft ] ) is the _ contact process on a complete graph _ ,",
    "in which the rate for a vacant site to turn occupied is @xmath45 times the fraction of _ all _ sites that are occupied , rather than the fraction of nearest neighbors .",
    "since each site interacts equally with all others , all pairs of sites are neighbors , defining a complete graph . given its connections with epidemic modeling and percolation ,",
    "this model has also been called  percolitis \" @xcite .",
    "the state of the process is specified by a single variable @xmath1 : the number of occupied or infected sites .",
    "this is a one - step process with nonzero transition rates    @xmath46    @xmath47    on a graph of @xmath6 sites .",
    "these expressions yield the master equation    @xmath48 n p_n \\ ; , \\label{cpcgme}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 in the contact process , and under the qs hypothesis , @xmath52    if we insert eq .",
    "( [ qshyp ] ) in the master equation , then , dividing through by @xmath23 we obtain @xmath53 \\overline{p}_{n-1 } + ( n\\!+\\!1)\\overline{p}_{n+1 }   -[\\overline{\\lambda}(\\omega\\!-\\!n)+1]n \\overline{p}_n   +   \\overline{p}_1 \\overline{p}_n = 0 , \\label{reccp}\\ ] ] for @xmath54 . for a given @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ reccp ] ) furnishes a relation for @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "letting @xmath58 $ ] , we have    @xmath59    and @xmath60\\ ] ] for @xmath61 .",
    "thus the qs distribution is completely determined once @xmath62 is known ; the latter is determined via the normalization condition , eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) .    in practice",
    "the following iterative scheme converges very quickly .",
    "starting with a guess for @xmath62 ( unity , for instance ) , one uses the recurrence relations to find the corresponding @xmath56 , and then evaluates @xmath63 .",
    "the procedure is then repeated using @xmath64 ; after a modest number of steps , @xmath65 converges to unity , at which point the @xmath56 represent the qs distribution .",
    "we have confirmed that the master equation for the contact process on a complete graph does in fact attain the qs distribution at long times .",
    "we integrate the master equation using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme @xcite , and stop the integration when the mean population conditioned on survival , @xmath66 , changes by less than @xmath67 per time step .",
    "the resulting distribution , @xmath68 is compared with the qs distribution furnished via the recurrence relations in figure 1 ; they are identical .",
    "having constructed the qs distribution and verified that it indeed represents the long - time distribution ( conditioned on survival ) , as given by the master equation , we now examine some properties of the qs state .",
    "figure 2 shows the quasi - stationary population density @xmath69 versus @xmath45 for various system sizes .",
    "this plot looks strikingly similar to finite - size plots of the order parameter at a continuous phase transition .",
    "in particular , it is evident that the @xmath45-dependence is smooth for any finite system , but that on increasing @xmath6 , the function @xmath70 approaches a singular limit .    on finite - dimensional lattices the value of the order parameter at the critical point is expected to scale as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the critical exponents governing the order parameter and the divergence of the correlation length @xcite . here",
    "we find @xmath74 ( from results for @xmath75 ) .",
    "we note that the mean - field exponent values @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the contact process would lead one to expect @xmath78 .",
    "the reason for the difference would seem to be that on a complete graph ( where each site is , in effect , a unit distance from all others ) , the correlation length is undefined , and so finite - size scaling ideas do not apply . instead , we can understand the exponent -1/2 by noting that the microscopic equation ( [ cpmft ] ) , gives @xmath79 at the critical point , so that @xmath1 is purely a fluctuation .",
    "the central limit theorem then requires @xmath80 .",
    "away from the critical point , @xmath81 , the finite - size correction to the mean - field solution , @xmath82 , is @xmath83 .",
    "another property of interest at a continuous phase transition is the moment ratio @xmath84 .",
    "this quantity is analogous to binder s reduced fourth cumulant @xcite , at an equilibrium critical point : the curves @xmath85 for various @xmath6 cross near @xmath86 ( the crossings approach @xmath86 ) , so that @xmath2 assumes a universal value @xmath87 at the critical point .",
    "for the basic contact process ( and other models in the universality class of directed percolation ) , @xmath88 and 1.326 in one and two dimensions , respectively @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we plot @xmath2 for the quasi - stationary contact process on a complete graph .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior is similar to that observed on finite - dimensional lattices , with @xmath89 becoming ever steeper with increasing system size ; @xmath90 for large @xmath6 .",
    "the crossings approach @xmath86 , as expected .",
    "we find that @xmath91 for large @xmath6 .",
    "as noted above , the survival probability decays as @xmath92 .",
    "we may therefore interpret @xmath93 as the quasi - stationary decay rate .",
    "the qs lifetime , @xmath94 , grows as @xmath95 $ ] for @xmath96 , as can be seen from figure 4 , where we plot @xmath97 versus @xmath45 for several system sizes . at the critical point , @xmath98",
    "it may appear surprising that we are able to discuss quasi - stationary properties for @xmath34 , where an active stationary state does not exist , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the existence of nontrivial qs properties for @xmath34 is in fact a finite - size effect , analogous to a nonzero magnetization in the ising model above the critical temperature , on a finite lattice . for @xmath96 the qs",
    "state converges , as @xmath99 , to the true stationary state , while for @xmath34 it converges to the absorbing state .",
    "but since the properties of any _ finite _ system are nonsingular , we must expect a smooth decay of , for example , the density , as @xmath100 .",
    "the contact process on a finite graph ( be it a regular lattice , a complete graph , or small - world network ) has only the absorbing state as its true stationary state .",
    "it is nonetheless instructive to examine the result of _ forcing _ a time - independent solution on the master equation .",
    "this is easily done by introducing the generating function @xmath101 .",

    "for this reason we call @xmath111 a _ pseudo - stationary _ distribution .",
    "similar pseudo - stationary distributions have been derived by muoz from the fokker - planck equation for continuous versions of the contact process and of a model with multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "if we treat @xmath111 as a proper probability distribution , restricting it to @xmath112 , and normalizing it on this set , then the resulting distribution turns out to be very close to the quasi - stationary one when @xmath113 is negligible in the vicinity of @xmath110 .",
    "figure 5 ( for @xmath114 ) shows that the two distributions are essentially identical for @xmath115 ( as they are for larger @xmath45 values ) , and for @xmath116 , except for small @xmath1 . for @xmath117 , however , the distributions are radically different ; in particular , we see that the pseudo - stationary distribution does not respect the absorbing boundary at @xmath118 .    in summary",
    ", the pseudo - stationary distribution provides a simple and useful approximation to the true qs distribution for @xmath45 ( and @xmath6 ) sufficiently large that @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "( in this case the survival probability decays extremely slowly , rendering the hypothesis of a stationary distribution - while strictly incorrect - at least reasonable . )",
    "as we approach the critical value , however , the region near @xmath118 assumes dominance , and @xmath121 bears little relation to the quasi - stationary distribution .",
    "the malthus - verhulst process ( mvp ) is a birth - and - death type process , @xmath122 , very similar to the contact process on a complete graph , but with the difference that @xmath1 may assume any nonnegative integer value .",

    "thus we have    @xmath233    by similar arguments , we find :    @xmath234    in the macroscopic limit , the master equation defined by these rates yields a pair of coupled equations for the particle density @xmath33 and the pair density @xmath235 @xcite . the critical value @xmath236 in this approximation .",
    "since this is not a one - step process , we can not obtain the qs distribution via recurrence relations , as was done in the previous examples .",
    "the most obvious approach - direct integration of the master equation - works reasonably well for modest system sizes ( @xmath237 or so ) , but becomes very slow for large @xmath6 .",
    "this is due in part to the large number of equations ( @xmath238 ) , and to the fact that the transition rates are @xmath239 , forcing one to use a time step @xmath240 , to avoid numerical instability . a much more efficient iterative scheme that converges directly to the qs distribution",
    "is described in ref .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is that in the qs regime ,    @xmath241    for any nonabsorbing state @xmath1 , where @xmath242 is the flux of probability into state @xmath1 ( @xmath243 is the flux into the absorbing state ) , and @xmath244 is the total transition rate exiting @xmath1 .",
    "the iterative scheme @xcite starts with an arbitrary distribution @xmath245 normalized on @xmath54 ( or , in the multivariate case , on the set of nonabsorbing states ) .",
    "next one evaluates    @xmath246    where @xmath247 is a parameter between zero and one .",
    "the new distribution @xmath248 is then normalized , and inserted in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ itqss ] ) , and the process repeated until it converges . for large @xmath6 the time to reach the qs distribution is three or more orders of magnitude smaller than that required for numerical integration .",
    "( in the present case convergence is enhanced if one uses a small value for @xmath247 , e.g. , 0.01 .",
    "a further economy is realized by noting that , near @xmath86 , @xmath249 is extremely small for @xmath250 , allowing one to truncate the distribution . for @xmath251 and @xmath252 , for example , @xmath253 for @xmath254 . )",
    "we studied the qs properties of the contact process on a ring of @xmath255 , 20 , 40 , ... , 2560 sites , using the pair approximation .",
    "figure 10 shows that the dependence of the particle density and the moment ratio on @xmath45 and on system size is qualitatively similar to that found in the complete graph case .",
    "the scaling laws for the density ( @xmath256 ) and the lifetime ( @xmath257 ) at the critical point are the same as for the cp on a complete graph .",
    "the critical values of the moment ratio @xmath2 at @xmath86 , extrapolated to infinite system size , yield @xmath258 , nearly the same as for the cp on a complete graph .",
    "the critical probability distribution @xmath259 again shows a scaling collapse ( figure 11 ) , but the scaling function differs somewhat from that for the complete graph .",
    "figure 12 shows the joint qs distribution @xmath260 at the critical point , for @xmath261 . for each @xmath1",
    "there is a most probable number , @xmath262 , of pairs ; @xmath263 grows linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "as a final example we consider a population consisting of two types , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , that evolve according to the mvp analyzed in sec .",
    "3 . ( the two subpopulations may , for example , possess different alleles of a certain gene , in a species with asexual reproduction . )",
    "@xmath194 and @xmath195 interact via two mechanisms : ( 1 ) each individual competes with all others ( regardless of type ) for access to resources ; ( 2 ) on reproducing , @xmath194 mutates to @xmath195 with probability @xmath264 , and vice - versa .",
    "thus we have the following set of transition rates :    @xmath265    @xmath266    @xmath267    @xmath268    where @xmath269 .",
    "evidently the state @xmath270 is absorbing .",
    "for mutation probability @xmath271 , @xmath272 is also absorbing ( similarly @xmath273 ) , and in the qs state only one type is present , i.e. , @xmath274 if both @xmath275 and @xmath276 are nonzero .",
    "this prompts us to investigate the effect of a nonzero mutation rate : will the predominance of one species persist when mutation is possible ? to address this issue we study the order parameter    @xmath277    in the qs state .",
    "figure 13 shows how @xmath278 varies with @xmath264 , for various system sizes .",
    "the competing mvps are both at the critical point , @xmath279 .",
    "( for simplicity we take all rates , @xmath280 , @xmath281 , and @xmath126 , equal to unity ) .",
    "the order parameter decreases with increasing mutation probability , as expected , and with increasing system size . from analysis of @xmath278 at various @xmath264-values , as a function of @xmath6",
    ", it appears that @xmath282 for _ any _ nonzero @xmath264 . in other words ,",
    "an arbitrarily small mutation rate restores the symmetry of the process .",
    "we observe qualitatively similar behavior in @xmath283 above the critical point ( @xmath284 ) . at the critical point ,",
    "the decay of @xmath283 with @xmath6 is slower than exponential , but faster than a power law ; it can be fit approximately by a stretched exponential @xmath285 $ ] , where the factor @xmath286 depends on @xmath264 ( see figure 13 inset ) .",
    "we study quasi - stationary probability distributions for markov processes exhibing a phase transition between an active and an absorbing state . the qs distribution , which represents the long - time limit of the probability distribution , conditioned on survival , yields a complete statistical description of the process in this limit .",
    "while the qs distribution can always , in principle , be found by integrating the master equation , we present much more efficient methods for its generation : recurrence relations for one - step processes , and an iterative scheme for multi - step or multivariate processes .        where @xmath288 is the flux of probability into state @xmath4 .",
    "( as usual we take state 0 as absorbing . ) without the final term on the right - hand side , this is simply the master equation . including this term",
    ", however , the equation has as its stationary solution the qs distribution , @xmath21 . in other words",
    ", the qs distribution corresponds to the stationary state of a  process \" in which all flux to the absorbing state is immediately _ reinserted _ into the non - absorbing subspace .",
    "the portion alloted to state @xmath1 is equal to its probability , @xmath15 .",
    "thus the qs distribution does not result from imposing a simple boundary condition ( such as periodic , or reflection at the origin ) , on the original master equation . since eq .",
    "( [ qme ] ) is nonlinear , it is not a master equation .",
    "it may happen , nevertheless , that the qs distribution for a certain process ( possessing an absorbing state ) , is also the _ stationary _ distribution for some other process , as in fact was found for the voter model .    in this work we study qs distributions for processes with an absorbing state , but without spatial structure .",
    "we find that the malthus - verhulst process and the contact process on a complete graph have the same scaling properties near their respective critical points .",
    "a study of schlgl s second model illustruates how a discontinuous phase transition emerges in the infinite - size limit , associated with a rapid change in the qs distribution , which is bimodal in the vicinity of the transition . the voter model on a complete graph serves as a negative example",
    ": it has no active stationary state , and the qs distribution , which is uniform on the set of allowed density values , is very different from the true long - time distribution , even in the infinite - size limit .",
    "our two final examples are bivariate processes .",
    "the pair approximation to the contact process shows scaling properties that are very similar to those of the complete - graph version .",
    "a study of a pair of competing malthus - verhulst processes reveals that mutation causes a radical change in the qs distribution .",
    "several directions for future work on quasi - stationary distributions can be mentioned .",
    "first , it should be possible to derive continuum equations , analogous to the fokker - planck equation , to describe the qs distribution in the limit of large system size .",
    "second , analysis of qs properties for a series of system sizes promises to be a useful method for studying lattice models possessing an absorbing state . through finite - size scaling analyses and extrapolation procedures ,",
    "it should be possible to extract useful estimates of critical properties for such models .",
    "finally , numerical study of more elaborate models used in epidemiology and population dynamics may yield a better understanding of such processes .",
