    "the study of the properties of hadrons in hot and dense matter is receiving a lot of attention in recent years to understand fundamental aspects of the strong interaction , such as the partial restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite , as well as a variety of astrophysical phenomena , such as the dynamical evolution of supernovas and the composition of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "a special effort has been invested to understand the properties of antikaons in the medium , especially after the speculation of the possible existence of an antikaon condensed phase was put forward in @xcite which would soften the equation - of - state producing , among other phenomena , lower neutron star masses @xcite .    while it is well established that the antikaons should feel an attractive interaction when they are embedded in a nuclear environment , the size of this attraction has been the subject of intense debate .",
    "theoretical models including medium effects on the antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitude , the behaviour of which is governed by the isospin zero @xmath4 resonance , naturally explain the evolution from repulsion in free - space to attraction in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of the resonance makes the size of the antikaon - nucleus potential be very sensitive to the many - body treatment of the medium effects .",
    "the phenomenological attempts of extracting information about the antikaon - nucleus potential from kaonic - atom data favoured very strongly attractive well depths @xcite , but recent self - consistent in - medium calculations @xcite based on chiral lagrangian s @xcite or meson - exchange potentials @xcite predict a moderately attractive kaon - nucleus interaction .",
    "in fact , recent analysis of kaonic atoms @xcite are able to find a reasonable reproduction of the data with relative shallow antikaon - nucleus potentials , therefore indicating that kaonic atom data can not really pin down the strength of the antikaon - nucleus potential at nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "on the other hand , heavy - ion collisions at energies around @xmath5 agev offer the possibility of studying experimentally the properties of a dense and hot nuclear system @xcite .",
    "in particular , a considerable amount of information about strange particles like antikaons is available .",
    "since antikaons are produced at finite density and finite momentum , the chiral models have recently incorporated the higher partial waves of the antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitude both in free space@xcite and in the nuclear medium @xcite . the complete scenario taking into account finite density ,",
    "finite momentum and finite temperature has recently been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "event generators trying to analyse heavy - ion collision data @xcite need to implement the modified properties of the hadrons in the medium where they are produced .",
    "transport models have shown , for instance , that the multiplicity distributions of kaons and antikaons are much better reproduced if in - medium masses rather than bare masses are used @xcite .",
    "production and propagation of kaons and antikaons have been investigated with the kaon spectrometer ( kaos ) of the sis heavy - ion synchrotron at gsi ( darmstadt ) .",
    "the experiments have been performed with au@xmath6au , ni@xmath6ni , c@xmath6c at energies between @xmath7 and @xmath8 agev @xcite .",
    "one surprising observation in c@xmath6c and ni@xmath6ni collisions @xcite is that , as a function of the energy difference @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the needed energy to produce the particle ( @xmath11 gev for @xmath1 via @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev for @xmath0 via @xmath14 ) , the number of @xmath0 balanced the number of @xmath1 in spite of the fact that in @xmath15 collisions the production cross - sections close to threshold are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude different .",
    "this has been interpreted to be a manifestation of the enhancement of the @xmath1 mass and the reduction of the @xmath0 one in the nuclear medium , which in turn influence the corresponding production thresholds @xcite , although a complementary explanation in terms of in - medium enhanced @xmath16 production has also been given @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation is that at incident energies of @xmath17 and @xmath18 agev , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities have the same impact parameter dependence @xcite .",
    "equal centrality dependence for @xmath1 and @xmath0 and , hence , independence of centrality for the @xmath19 ratio has also been observed in au@xmath6au and pb@xmath6pb reactions between @xmath20 agev and rhic energies ( @xmath21 agev ) @xcite .",
    "this independence of centrality is astonishing , since at low energies one expects that as centrality increases  and with it the participating system size and the density probed  the @xmath19 ratio should also increase due to the increased reduction of the @xmath0 mass together with the enhancement of the @xmath1 mass .",
    "in fact , the independence of the @xmath19 ratio on centrality has often been advocated as signalling the lack of in - medium effects .",
    "a recent interesting interpretation of this phenomenon is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the @xmath0 are predominantly produced via @xmath22 collisions ( @xmath23 ) and , hence , the @xmath0 multiplicity is strongly correlated with the @xmath1 one , since kaons and hyperons are mainly produced together via the reaction @xmath24 .",
    "although the transport model calculations show that strangeness equilibration requires times of the order of @xmath25 fm / c @xcite , statistical models , which assume chemical and thermal equilibrium and common freeze - out parameters for all particles , are quite successful in describing particle yields including strange particles @xcite .",
    "the kaon and antikaon yields in the statistical models are based on free masses and no medium effects are needed to describe the enhanced in - medium @xmath19 ratio or its independence with centrality .",
    "the increased value of the @xmath19 ratio is simply obtained by choosing a particular set of parameters at freeze - out , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath26 mev and the temperature @xmath27 mev , which also reproduce a variety of particle multiplicity ratios @xcite . on the other hand , centrality independence of the @xmath19 ratio",
    "is automatically obtained in statistical models within the canonical or grand - canonical schemes because the terms depending on the system size drop out @xcite . however , as shown by brown et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the reduced in - medium @xmath0 mass in the statistical model would force , in order to reproduce the experimental value of the @xmath19 ratio , a larger value of the chemical potential and hence a larger and more plausible baryonic density for strangeness production .",
    "in addition , brown et al . introduce the concept of  broad - band equilibration \" according to which the @xmath0 mesons and the hyperons are produced in an essentially constant ratio independent of density , hence explaining also the centrality independence of the @xmath19 ratio but including medium effects .",
    "in essence , the establishment of a broad - band relies on the fact that the baryonic chemical potential @xmath28 increases with density an amount which coincides roughly with the reduction of the @xmath0 mass . however , as mentioned above , the antikaon properties are very sensitive to the type of model for the @xmath29 interaction used and of the in - medium effects included .",
    "the purpose of the present work is precisely to investigate to which extent the  broad - band equilibration \" concept holds when more sophisticated models for the in - medium antikaon properties are used .",
    "we explore within the context of a statistical model what is the behaviour of the @xmath19 ratio as a function of the nuclear density when the hadrons are dressed , paying special attention to different ways of dressing the antikaons : either treating them as non - interacting , or dressing them with an on - shell self - energy , or , finally , considering the complete antikaon spectral density .",
    "we use the antikaon self - energy which has been derived within the framework of a coupled - channel self - consistent calculation in symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature @xcite , taking as bare meson - baryon interaction the meson exchange potential of the jlich group @xcite .",
    "we will show that the determination of temperature and chemical potential at freeze - out conditions compatible with the experimental value of the @xmath0/@xmath1 ratio is very delicate , and depends very strongly on the approximation adopted for the antikaon self - energy .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the formalism of the thermal model is described and the different ingredients used in the determination of the off - shell properties of the @xmath0 are given .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , our concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "in this section we present a brief description of the thermal models to account for strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions . the basic hypothesis is to assume that the relative abundance of kaons and antikaons in the final state of relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions is determined by imposing thermal and chemical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the number of strange particles in the final state is small requires a strict treatment of the conservation of strangeness and , for this quantum number , one has to work in the canonical scheme .",
    "other conservation laws must also be imposed , like baryon number and electric charge conservation .",
    "since the number of baryons and charged particles is large , they can be treated in the grand - canonical ensemble . in this way , the conservation laws associated to these other quantum numbers are satisfied on average , allowing for fluctuations around the corresponding mean values .    to restrict the ensemble according to the exact strangeness conservation law , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite , one has to project the grand - canonical partition function , @xmath30 , onto a fixed value of strangeness @xmath31 ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 are the baryon , strangeness and charge fugacities , respectively , and where @xmath34 stands explicitly for @xmath35 .",
    "only particles with @xmath36 are included in the grand - canonical partition function because , in the range of energies achieved at gsi , they are produced with a higher probability than particles with @xmath37 .",
    "the grand - canonical partition function is calculated assuming an independent particle behaviour and the boltzmann approximation for the one - particle partition function of the different particle species . in principle , one deals with a dilute system , so the independent particle model seems justified . however , medium effects on the particle properties can be relevant . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to study how the dressing of the hadrons present in the gas , especially the antikaons , affects the observables such as the ratio of kaon and antikaon particle multiplicities , in particular for the conditions of the heavy - ion collisions at sis / gsi energies .    within the approximations mentioned above",
    ", the grand - canonical partition function reads as follows , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the sum over one - particle partition functions of all particles and resonances with strangeness @xmath36 , @xmath40 the expressions @xmath41 and @xmath42 indicate the one - particle partition function for baryons and mesons respectively , while @xmath43 is the one - particle partition function associated to a baryonic or mesonic resonance . in the latter case , however , the factor @xmath44 would not be present in eq .",
    "( [ reso ] ) .",
    "notice that the resonance is described by means of a breit - wigner parameterisation .",
    "the quantity v is the interacting volume of the system , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are spin - isospin degeneracy factors and @xmath28 and @xmath48 are the baryonic and charge chemical potentials of the system . for ni+ni system at sis energies , @xmath48 can be omitted because it is associated to the isospin - asymmetry of the system and , in this case , the deviation from the isospin - symmetric case is only @xmath49 ( see ref .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath28 will be fixed to the nucleonic chemical potential , @xmath50 , because the abundance of nucleons is larger than the one for the other baryons produced .",
    "the energies @xmath51 , @xmath52 refer to the in - medium single - particle energies of the hadrons present in the system at a given temperature .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the canonical partition function for total strangeness @xmath53 is    @xmath54    in this work , as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the small and large volume limits of the particle abundances were studied .",
    "these limits were performed to show that the canonical treatment of strangeness in obtaining the particle abundances gives completely different results in comparison to the grand - canonical scheme , demonstrating at the same time that , for the volume considered , the canonical scheme is the appropriate one .",
    "the aim of going through these limits again in the following is to remind the reader that , for the specific case of the ratio @xmath19 , the result is independent of the size of the system and is the same for both the canonical and grand - canonical treatments .    according to statistical mechanics , to compute the number of kaons and antikaons  @xcite one has to differentiate the partition function with respect to the particle fugacity @xmath55 expanding @xmath56 in the small volume limit , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "are given by @xmath59 where antibaryons have not been considered because the ratio @xmath60 is negligibly small at gsi / sis colliding energies , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the number of baryons and antibaryons , respectively .",
    "the expression for @xmath58 ( @xmath57 ) indicates that the number of @xmath1(@xmath0 ) has to be balanced with all particles and resonances with @xmath63(@xmath64 ) .",
    "it can be observed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallvolume ] ) that the ratio @xmath0/@xmath65 in the canonical ensemble does not depend on the volume because it cancels out exactly .    at the other extreme ,",
    "i.e. in the thermodynamic limit ( large volumes ) , since it is known that the canonical treatment is equivalent to the grand canonical one , one can compute the ratio explicitly from the grand canonical partition function @xmath66 ,    @xmath67    where @xmath68(@xmath69 ) is the sum of one - particle partition functions for baryons ( mesons ) with @xmath70 . then , by imposing strangeness conservation on average ,    @xmath71    one can easily obtain @xmath34 , @xmath72 therefore , from @xmath73 one obtains the ratio @xmath74 the condition @xmath75 and dealing with strange particles of @xmath76 makes the ratio independent of the volume .",
    "although the expression obtained is the same as that from the canonical ensemble in the small volume limit , the proof that the ratio @xmath19 is independent of the volume has to be obtained from a general intermediate size situation .",
    "this was shown to be the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where expanding @xmath77 of eq .",
    "( [ canon3 ] ) in power series , it was expressed as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the partition function that includes all particles and resonances with @xmath53 , @xmath80 is the modified bessel function , and @xmath81 .",
    "the computed @xmath19 ratio gave precisely the same expression as those given here for small [ eq.([eq : smallvolume ] ) ] and large [ eq.([eq : largevolume ] ) ] volumes .",
    "therefore , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0/@xmath1 ratio is independent of the volume and , consequently , independent on whether it is calculated in the canonical or grand - canonical schemes .      in this subsection",
    "we study how the in - medium modifications of the properties of the hadrons at finite temperature affect the value of the @xmath0/@xmath1 ratio , focusing our attention on the properties of the antikaons in hot and dense matter . for consistency with previous papers ,",
    "we prefer to compute the inverse ratio @xmath1/@xmath0 .",
    "as it was mentioned before , the number of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) has to be balanced by particles and resonances with @xmath82(@xmath63 ) in order to conserve strangeness exactly .",
    "for balancing the number of @xmath1 , the main contribution in the @xmath63 sector comes from the @xmath83 and @xmath84 hyperons and , in a smaller proportion , from the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in addition , the effect of the @xmath85 resonance is also considered because it is comparable to that of the @xmath0 mesons . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of @xmath0 is balanced only by the presence of @xmath1 .",
    "then , we can write the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio as ,    @xmath86    where the @xmath87 s indicate the different one - particle partition functions for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath88 , and , for baryons , they now contain the corresponding fugacity .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamb - sig - k ] ) that the relative abundance of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath88 baryons with respect to that of @xmath0 mesons determines the value of the ratio .",

    "a particular effort has been invested in studying the antikaon properties in the medium since the @xmath29 has a particularly rich structure due to the presence of the @xmath4 resonance @xcite .",

    "two different prescriptions for the single - particle energy of the antikaons have been considered .",

    "we note , however , that only the s - wave contribution of the jlich @xmath112 interaction has been kept .",
    "the reason is that this potential presents some short - comings in the @xmath113 partial wave , which manifest themselves especially in the low energy region of the @xmath2 self - energy .",
    "specifically , the @xmath83 and @xmath84 poles of the @xmath29 @xmath114-matrix come out lower about @xmath115 than the physical values and , consequently , the corresponding strength in the antikaon spectral function due to hyperon - hole excitations appears at too low energies , a region very important for the calculation we are conducting here .",

    "in this section we discuss the effects of dressing the @xmath137 mesons in hot and dense nuclear matter on the @xmath137/@xmath1 ratio around the value found in ni+ni collisions at an energy of 1.93 @xmath138 .",
    "a preliminary study was already reported in ref .",

    "the two chosen temperatures roughly delimit the range of temperatures which have been claimed to reproduce , in the framework of the thermal model , not only the @xmath139/@xmath0 ratio but also all the other particle ratios involved in the ni+ni collisions at sis energies@xcite .    since the baryonic chemical potential @xmath28 grows with density , the factor @xmath141 in the partition functions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lam - sig ] ) , ( [ eq : resonance ] ) allows one to understand why the ratio increases so strongly with density in the free gas approximation ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the same is true when the particles are dressed . in this case",

    ", the model of ref.@xcite assumed a slower variation of @xmath28 , from 860 mev to 905 mev , which was almost cancelled by the change of @xmath144 from 380 mev to 332 mev , giving therefore a practically density independent ratio .",
    "we note that our chemical potential is derived from a nucleonic energy spectrum obtained in a walecka @xmath145 model , using density dependent scalar and vector coupling constants fitted to reproduce dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculation [ see table 10.9 in ref.@xcite ] .",

    "the @xmath146 ratio remains constant at intermediate and high densities .",
    "the use of the spectral density implicitly amounts to an additional gain in binding energy for the antikaons and , as density increases , it compensates rather well the variation of @xmath28 . to understand the origin of this additional effective attraction when the full spectral density is used , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio2 ] the two functions that contribute to the integral over the energy in the definition of the @xmath0 partition function [ eq.([eq : offshell ] ) ] , namely the boltzmann factor @xmath147 and the @xmath0 spectral functions including l=0 ( long - dashed line ) and l=0 + 1 ( solid line ) components of the @xmath148 interaction , for a momentum @xmath149 mev at @xmath150 @xmath96 and t@xmath151 mev . as it is clearly seen in the figure ,",
    "the overlap of the boltzmann factor with the quasi - particle peak of the @xmath0 spectral function is small for this momentum .",
    "it is precisely the overlap with the strength in the low energy region that acts as a source of attraction in the contribution to the @xmath0 partition function .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced when the p - waves are included , due to the additional low - energy components in the spectral function coming from the coupling of the @xmath0 meson to hyperon - hole ( @xmath117 ) excitations , where @xmath118 stands for @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath88 .",
    "assigning these low energy components to real antikaons in the medium is not clear , since one should interpret them as representing the production of hyperons through @xmath152 conversion .",
    "while this is certainly true , it may also happen that , once these additional hyperons are present in the system , they can subsequently interact with fast non - strange particles ( pions , nucleons ) to create new antikaons .",
    "a clear interpretation on what fraction of the low energy strength will emerge as antikaons at freeze - out is certainly an interesting question and its investigation will be left here for forthcoming work .",
    "once the integral over the energy is performed , the determination of the @xmath0 partition function still requires an integral over the momentum .",
    "the integrand as a function of momentum is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio3 ] for the same density and temperature than in the previous figure . as expected ,",
    "the integrand is larger when the full spectral density is considered . in this case , the @xmath0 partition function is enhanced and therefore the @xmath139/@xmath0 ratio is smaller than in the on - shell approximation and also in the case where only the l=0 contributions to the spectral density are used .",
    "notice the behaviour at large @xmath153 , which decays very quickly in the on - shell approximation but has a long tail for the @xmath154 spectral density originated from the coupling of the @xmath0 meson to @xmath155 configurations .",
    "another aspect that we want to consider is how the dressing of the @xmath84 hyperon affects the value of the ratio . in fig .",

    "the dotted line corresponds to the case where only the @xmath83 hyperons , dressed with the attractive mean - field potential given in the previous section , are included to balance strangeness .",
    "when the @xmath84 hyperon is incorporated with a moderately attractive potential of the type @xmath157 mev , the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio is enhanced substantially ( dashed line ) .",
    "this enhancement is more moderate when one uses the repulsive potential @xmath158 instead ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "finally , the additional contribution of the @xmath88 resonance produces only a small increase of the ratio ( solid line ) due to its higher mass .",
    "we have checked that heavier strange baryonic or mesonic resonances do not produce visible changes in our results .",
    "notice also that , although the ratios obtained with both prescriptions for the mean - field potential of the @xmath84 meson differ appreciably , the present uncertainties in the ratio would not permit to discriminate between them .    in the framework of the statistical model ,",

    "the dot - dashed line stands for a free gas of hadrons , similar to the calculations reported in refs .",
    "the dotted line shows the @xmath161 curve obtained with the on - shell or mean - field approximation [ see eqs.([eq : onshell ] ) and ( [ eq : self0 ] ) ] , while the dashed and solid lines correspond to the inclusion of the off - shell properties of the @xmath137 self - energy by using its spectral density [ eqs .",

    "the temperatures compatible with a ratio @xmath1/@xmath162 imply a narrow range of values for the baryonic chemical potentials , namely @xmath163 $ ] @xmath164 for temperatures in the range of 20 to 100 mev .",
    "these values translate into density ranges of @xmath165 $ ] .    as it can be seen from the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio6 ] , the attractive mean - field potential of the antikaons compensates the effect of increasing baryochemical potential @xmath28 . as a consequence",
    ", the density at which the freeze - out temperature compatible with the measured ratio takes place also grows . but this attraction is not enough to get the same @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio for a substantially broader range of density compared to the free case .",
    "so we do not see a clear indication of `` broad - band equilibration '' in our self - consistent mean - field calculation in contrast to the results of brown , rho , and song @xcite .",
    "the influence of the antikaon dressing on the ratio is much more evident when the spectral density is employed ( long - dashed and solid lines ) . from the preceding discussions , it is easy to understand that the low energy behaviour of the spectral density enhances the @xmath0 contribution to the ratio , having a similar role as an attractive potential and , hence , the value of @xmath28 compatible with a ratio at a given temperature increases .",
    "moreover , due to the bending of the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio with density and its evolution with temperature observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio1 ] , it is clear that there will be a maximum value of t compatible with a given value of the ratio . below this maximum temperature",
    ", there will be two densities or , equivalently , two chemical potentials compatible with the ratio .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath1/@xmath0=30 will in fact not be realized with the temperatures of @xmath156 mev and @xmath166 mev displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio1 ] , if the antikaon is dressed with the spectral density containing @xmath167 and @xmath113 components . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio6 ] , only temperatures lower than @xmath168 mev are compatible with ratio values of 30 !",
    "we note that the flat regions depicted by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio6 ] could be considered to be in correspondence with the notion of  broad - band equilibration \" of brown et al .",
    "@xcite , in the sense that a narrow range of temperatures and a wide range of densities are compatible with a particular value of the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio .",
    "nevertheless , the temperature range is too low to be compatible with the measured slope parameter of the pion spectra .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath1/@xmath0=30 , we observe a nearly constant ratio observed in the range of @xmath169 mev covering a range of chemical potentials in between @xmath170 mev which translates into a density range @xmath171 $ ] .",
    "note that in this case , we can hardly speak of a broad - band equilibration in the sense of that introduced by brown , rho and song in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a ratio @xmath1/@xmath0=30 holds over a large range of densities in between @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath142 mev .",
    "however , as we indicated at the beginning of this section , this result was obtained in the framework of a mean - field model and our equivalent on - shell results ( dashed lines in figs .  [ fig : ratio1 ] , [ fig : ratio6 ] ) , based on a stronger variation of the @xmath28 with density and on a less attractive @xmath174 , seem to be very far from producing the broad - band equilibration behaviour .",
    "as pointed out before , our nucleon chemical potential is obtained in the framework of a relativistic model and varies with density more strongly than that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows values close to those for a free fermi gas .",
    "if we now calculate the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio using a @xmath175 for a free ( non - interacting ) system in the on - shell approximation , we obtain the thin dotted line in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratio1 ] . at @xmath166 mev",
    ", we now observe a tendency of a broad - band equilibration but for ratios higher than @xmath176 , of around @xmath177 .",
    "this is connected to the particular on - shell potential of the antikaon which , in our self - consistent procedure , turns to be moderately attractive . only if the attraction was larger would the broad band be realized in this on - shell picture for smaller values of the ratio as found by brown et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig : ratio7 ] shows the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio for the full model calculation as a contour plot for different temperatures and baryochemical potentials .",
    "we note , that the ratio is substantially lower at the temperature and density range of interest , being more likely around 15 or so for a moderately large region of baryochemical potential .",
    "note that this reduced ratio translates into an overall enhanced production of @xmath0 by a factor two compared to the experimentally measured value . at pion freeze - out",
    ", the medium can hold twice as many @xmath0 as needed to explain the measured enhanced production of @xmath0 if one considers the full spectral features of the @xmath0 in the medium .",
    "we stress again that this enhancement is not due to an increased attraction in the sense of a mean - field calculation .",
    "it is a consequence of the additional strength of the spectral function at low energies which emerges when taking into account p - wave hyperon - hole excitations .",
    "the boltzmann - factor amplifies the contribution of the low - energy region of the spectral function so that these excitations are becoming the main reason for the overall enhanced production of the @xmath0 in the medium .",
    "we have studied , within the framework of a statistical model , the influence of considering the modified properties in hot and dense matter of the hadrons involved in the determination of the @xmath19 ratio produced in heavy - ion collisions at sis / gsi .",
    "we have focused our attention on incorporating the effects of the antikaon self - energy , which was derived within the framework of a self - consistent coupled - channel calculation taking , as bare interaction , the meson - exchange potential of the jlich group for the s - wave and adding the p - wave components of the @xmath178 excitations , with @xmath179 .",
    "it is found that the determination of the temperature and chemical potential at freeze - out conditions compatible with the ratio @xmath19 is very delicate and depends very strongly on the approximation adopted for the antikaon self - energy .",
    "the effect of dressing the @xmath0 with an spectral function including both s- and p - wave components of the @xmath29 interaction lowers considerably the effective temperature while increasing the chemical potential @xmath28 up to @xmath180 mev , compared to calculations for a noninteracting hadron gas .",
    "when the free or on - shell properties of the antikaon are considered , the ratio at a given temperature shows a strong dependence with the density .",
    "this is in contrast with the `` broad - band equilibration '' advocated by brown et al .",
    "@xcite , which was established , in the context of a mean - field picture , through a compensation between the increased attraction of the mean - field @xmath2 potential as density grows with the increase in the baryon chemical potential .",
    "our mean - field properties do not achieve such a compensation due to a stronger increase of the nucleon chemical potential @xmath28 with density .",
    "when taking into account the full features of the spectral function of the @xmath0 via hyperon - hole excitations , we find that the @xmath19 ratio exhibits broad - band equilibration .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio is even in excess of the measured ratio at temperatures which are deduced from the slope parameter for pions .",
    "one can argue in principle , that dynamical non - equilibrium effects can reduce the number of @xmath0 by virtue of annihilation with nucleons to hyperons and pions at freeze - out .",
    "the number of the latter produced hadrons will not be altered substantially by this annihilation process as the @xmath0 is much less abundant than hyperons and especially pions . in our approach",
    ", we calculate the number density or particle ratios which are in the medium .",
    "what needs to be clarified is how the particles get on - shell at freeze - out , a question previously posed e.g.  for antiproton and antihyperon production at the gsi .",
    "clearly , this has to be addressed in dynamical models and we leave that investigation for forthcoming work .",
