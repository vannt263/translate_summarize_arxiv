    "the discovery of hundreds of ultra low - mass dwarfs and substellar objects by the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , the deep near infrared southern sky survey ( denis ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has provided a large data base from which to select l and t dwarfs for further study .",
    "the l dwarfs identified by these surveys have been classified using far optical ( @xmath6 0.6 - 1.0 @xmath7 ) spectroscopy and most have published _ j _ ( 1.1 - 1.4 @xmath7 ) , _ h _ ( 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath7 ) and _ k _ band ( 2.0 - 2.4 @xmath7 ) magnitudes @xcite .",
    "in addition several groups have used near - infrared spectroscopy from 1 to 2.5 @xmath7 to classify and study l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "comparatively , little work has been done beyond 2.5 @xmath7 , where to date only six l dwarfs have published _",
    "l_-band magnitudes @xcite .",
    "since brown dwarfs emit most of their flux in the near infrared , observations beyond 2.5 @xmath7 are useful to the determination of the bolometric luminosity of these objects .",
    "in addition water ( @xmath0 ) , carbon monoxide ( co ) , and methane ( @xmath1 ) which are among the most abundant atmospheric species after hydrogen ( h@xmath8 ) are important opacity sources at these wavelengths .    indeed @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 opacities dominate the _",
    "l_-band ( 2.5 - 4.1 @xmath7 ) radiative transfer .",
    "in particular the @xmath4 band ( 2.5 - 3.5 @xmath7 ) overlaps the strong @xmath9 fundamental band of @xmath1 at 3.3 @xmath7 , which is observable in some of the late l dwarfs and all of the t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "because chemical equilibrium favors @xmath1 over co with falling atmospheric temperature @xcite , the abundance of @xmath1 helps to constrain the effective temperature ( @xmath10 ) . in the _ l@xmath3 _ band ( 3.5 - 4.1 @xmath7 )",
    "@xmath0 alone is the dominant opacity source .",
    "atmosphere models @xcite suggest that the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color of l dwarfs is relatively insensitive to the details of cloud models , or even the absence of clouds , making this color a potentially interesting diagnostic of @xmath10 .",
    "when used together , the @xmath4 and _ l@xmath3 _ bands can probe for the appearance of @xmath1 in the latest l dwarfs , identify for trends in color which are a function of spectral type and temperature , and provide flux measurements for use in estimating the bolometric luminosity of these objects . here",
    "we report _",
    "l_-band observations for a sample of l and t dwarfs , their observed trends , and comment on the l - dwarf @xmath10 scale .",
    "the data were acquired using the near infrared camera , nirc @xcite on keck i at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory located in mauna kea , hawaii on april 13th and 14th , ut 2000 .",
    "photometry was obtained using _",
    "k _ , @xmath11 , @xmath4 , _ l@xmath3 _ and a 3.3 @xmath7 narrow band filter for 18 l dwarfs and 5 t dwarfs which were observable at a low airmass , and chosen to span the l - dwarf spectral sequence . where multiple objects of a given spectral type were available to observe , preference was given to those objects which were most typical in their ( _ j - k _ ) and ( _ h - k _ ) colors respective to spectral type @xcite .",
    "the resulting data set includes objects with spectral types ranging from l0 to l8 in the @xcite classification as well as five t dwarfs ranging from t0 to t6 in the a. burgasser ( 2001 , private communication ) classification .",
    "table 1 lists the targets , their coordinates , observed magnitudes and colors .",
    "both nights were photometric with seeing ranging between 0.35and 0.6 .",
    "since the radiation background from the sky is considerably larger at 3 @xmath7 and beyond , integration times were limited to 0.012 and 0.03 seconds in the _ l@xmath3 _ and @xmath4 bands . to achieve these integration times ,",
    "a 64 @xmath12 64 subsection of the chip was read out using the pat4xa timing pattern .",
    "standard chopping and nodding procedures were also employed to minimize errors resulting from temporal variations in the sky radiation background .    to place our photometry onto a standard infrared photometric system , standard stars were chosen from the ukirt fundamental and extended list @xcite and were observed at the same airmass directly before or after the target objects . in the case where a ukirt standard of the same airmass was not available to observe , standard stars were then chosen from the @xcite",
    "nicmos standard list and their magnitudes were converted to the ukirt system using the formula given by @xcite .",
    "these lists provided standard _ k_-band magnitudes , but not _",
    "l@xmath3 _ or @xmath4 magnitudes . to determine a standard magnitude for our _ l_-band observations we observed only main sequence standard stars with spectral types between a0v and g6v , and estimated a standard _ l@xmath3 _ or @xmath4 magnitude for each star using the intrinsic colors given by @xcite for a main sequence star of that spectral type . since the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) and ( _ k",
    "- l _ ) values of these stars vary between 0.0 for a0v to 0.05 for g6v , we estimate that this technique produces no more than a 5% error in our magnitude calculation and this error has been included in the final _ l@xmath3 _ and @xmath4 magnitude tabulation ( table 1 ) . as an additional check standard stars that deviated largely from the mean _",
    "l@xmath3 _ and @xmath4 zeropoint correction determined from all of the standard stars were discarded .",
    "this resulted in the elimination of no more than one standard star each night and we are confident that this technique produces valid _ l@xmath3 _ and @xmath4 magnitudes for our objects .    the standard stars used to calibrate the photometry in table 1 are on the ukirt ircam3 natural system . convolutions of the filter transmission profiles for the nirc and ircam3 filters with model spectra reveals a constant zeropoint offset between the two systems with no dependence on spectral type",
    ". thus the photometry presented in this paper is on the ukirt ircam3 system .",
    "it is important to note that this is not the same photometric system as the mauna kea observatory near - infrared system ( mko - nir ) .",
    "while the _ k _ band magnitudes for our l dwarfs can be placed on the mko - nir system using the transformation equations provided by @xcite , there is not a conversion equation for the _ l@xmath3 _ magnitudes .",
    "a comparison of the _ l@xmath3 _ filters for both the nirc and mko - nir systems reveals that the mko - nir filter extends farther into the blue from 3.4 to 4.1 @xmath7 while the nirc filter only extends from 3.5 to 4.1 @xmath7 .",
    "this results in the mko - nir filter being more sensitive to the appearance of @xmath1 absorption at 3.3 @xmath7 .",
    "the net effect is that for the hottest l dwarfs , our _ l@xmath3 _ magnitudes are almost identical to the mko - nir magnitudes . for",
    "the latest l dwarfs where @xmath1 is just beginning to affect the spectrum , our _ l@xmath3 _ magnitudes are 10% brighter , and for the t dwarfs where @xmath1 absorption is strongly established , our _ l@xmath3 _ magnitudes are 20% brighter ( differences of 0.1 and 0.2 mag respectively ) .",
    "thus any comparison of the _ l@xmath3 _ magnitudes from these two systems needs to take this offset into account .    as a final comment on the magnitudes presented here ,",
    "we need to mention that although observations were acquired using both the _ k _ and @xmath11 filters , we found that in general the _",
    "k_-band magnitude differed from the @xmath11-band magnitude by no more than 0.05 for the l dwarfs and 0.1 for the t dwarfs .",
    "in addition since transformation equations from the ukirt ircam3 system to the other standard infrared systems use the ukirt _",
    "k_-band magnitudes for conversion and not @xmath11 , we present only the _ k_-band magnitudes .",
    "figure 1 presents the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color of our objects as a function of l- and t - dwarf spectral class .",
    "the closed squares represent the objects from table 1 , and the open circles represent ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) colors for six l dwarfs by @xcite . in general the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color gradually increases with later l- and t - dwarf spectral type .",
    "a linear least squares fit of the data to the l dwarf index shows that the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) colors are reasonably well fit ( correlation coefficient , @xmath13 ) by a line with a slope of 0.092 and an intercept point of 0.87 . for l",
    "dwarfs the increase in ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color is due to increasing molecular absorption in the _ k _ band .",
    "as the @xmath10 decreases with later spectral type , the wings of the @xmath0 band at 1.9 @xmath7 and pressure induced @xmath14-@xmath14 absorption together suppress the _",
    "k_-band flux . in the _ l@xmath3 _ band",
    "the principle opacity source is @xmath0 alone .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the mean opacity increases more slowly in the _ l@xmath3 _ band than in the _ k _ band .",
    "the net result is that the total flux emitted in the _ k _ band falls faster than the total flux emitted in the _ l@xmath3 _ band with decreasing temperature .",
    "this produces the redder ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) colors with later l - dwarf spectral type .    a similar mechanism is responsible for the gradual reddening of the t dwarfs . for these objects @xmath1 joins @xmath0 and @xmath14-@xmath14 as the principle opacity sources . by definition ,",
    "the transition from the l to t dwarfs occurs when the @xmath15 combination band of @xmath1 first appears at 2.2 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a linear least squares fit ( @xmath16 ) of the t dwarf data produces a slightly steeper line with a slope of 0.161 and an intercept point of -0.19 .",
    "the change in slope from the l to t dwarfs suggests that the additional appearance of @xmath1 opacity further suppresses the flux in the _ k _ band , resulting in a steeper ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color increase throughout the t dwarfs . since the abundance of @xmath1 varies with @xmath10 and it is the dominant opacity source for t dwarfs at _",
    "k _ band , but not _",
    "l@xmath3 _ , the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color should prove to be a good diagnostic for estimating the @xmath10 of t dwarfs .",
    "figure 2 presents the ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) color of our objects as a function of l- and t - dwarf spectral class . like the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color , the increase in ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) through the l - dwarf spectral sequence is due to increasing @xmath0 and @xmath14-@xmath14 absorption in the _ k _ band .",
    "a linear least squares fit applied to this data ( @xmath17 ) produces a line with a slope of 0.06 and an intercept point of 0.14 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there appears to be substantially more scatter in the ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) color for the later l dwarfs ( and early t dwarfs ) as compared to the early l dwarfs .",
    "this scatter may arise from differences in cloud cover @xcite , or possibly atmospheric dynamics or metallicity producing greater variability in @xmath1 abundance in these objects .",
    "for the t dwarfs @xmath1 absorption definitely occurs both at 3.3 @xmath7 and 2.2 @xmath7 which results in a suppression of the flux in the @xmath4 and _ k _ bands .",
    "since the @xmath9 fundamental band of @xmath1 at 3.3 @xmath7 is a factor of 100 times stronger than the @xmath15 combination band at 2.2 @xmath7 , there is a greater suppression of the flux in the @xmath4 band than in the _ k _ band which results in a bluer color for the t dwarfs .",
    "if @xmath1 absorption were to gradually appear in the latest l dwarfs with falling @xmath10 , we would expect the ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) color of the late l dwarfs to gradually transition into the bluer color of the early t dwarfs .",
    "however , the abrupt transition in ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) from the latest l dwarfs to the earliest t dwarfs suggests that perhaps very early t dwarfs , or very late l dwarfs have yet to be discovered , or that substantial @xmath4 band @xmath1 absorption appears rapidly over a very small @xmath10 range .",
    "note that the two l1 dwarfs both have very blue ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) colors , but unexceptional ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) colors .",
    "these two objects were also unusually faint in narrow band 3.3 @xmath7 ( nirc pahl filter ) images obtained the same night .",
    "this suggests that another opacity source is affecting the flux in the @xmath4 band for these two objects .",
    "clearly 3 to 4 @xmath7 spectroscopy is needed to constrain what is suppressing the flux in the @xmath4 band .",
    "we are confident that the colors of the l1 dwarfs are not due to photometric errors since these objects were observed at different times during the night and with different standard stars .",
    "one of the l1 dwarfs , denis j1441 - 0945 , is a binary system and if the two components of the system have different @xmath4 magnitudes this may be the cause of the color discrepancy .",
    "indeed it does appear that the pair is of unequal brightness although they are too close for individual photometry .",
    "however this would imply that the other l1 dwarf is also a binary system and we see no evidence of multiplicity in our 0.5images of 2massw j1035 + 2507 .",
    "finally figure 3 presents a ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) verses ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color - color diagram with the data from table 1 .",
    "the progressive reddening in ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) is apparent as is the greater variability in ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) at the l to t transition .",
    "note that the l7 object , 2massi j1526 + 2043 , has the same ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) and ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) colors as an l4 dwarf .",
    "this l7 also has 2mass ( _",
    "j_-@xmath11 ) , ( _ j - h _ ) and ( _ h _ -@xmath11 ) colors which are most similar to an l3 or l4 dwarf @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this l7 dwarf has been misclassified and this should be kept in mind when studying its location in figures 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "a complete analysis of the l - dwarf @xmath10 scale requires consideration of infrared and optical spectra as well as photometry .",
    "however , we can use the results presented here to draw some tentative conclusions by comparing to atmospheric models of @xcite .",
    "these models account for sedimentation of atmospheric condensates as described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the models with the precipitation efficiency factor @xmath18 best fit the ( _ j - k _ ) colors of the l dwarfs and we use those models here .",
    "the models suggest that the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color of dusty l - dwarf models is insensitive to details of cloud structure or gravity . for 1300 k @xmath19 2100 k a remarkably accurate linear expression ( @xmath20 )",
    "reproduces the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) model colors as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "equating this expression with the regression line derived in figure 1 for the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) data gives the following estimate of l dwarf @xmath10 as a function of @xcite spectral type @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath10 is the effective temperature in kelvin , and @xmath21 = 0 to 8 .",
    "this equation was fit using only models appropriate for @xmath23 , however the colors depend only slightly on mass for this temperature range , and introduce only a few hundreths variation in the color difference at a fixed @xmath10 .    this equation is presented for its heuristic value as an indicator of the @xmath10 range of l - dwarfs and not as a definitive analysis .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to make some comparisons .",
    "the earliest l dwarfs appear to have @xmath24 to @xmath25 and the l - dwarf regime extends down to about @xmath26 . on average each @xcite",
    "spectral type spans about 100 k in @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10 derived here for l dwarfs can be compared to the results predicted by other research groups .",
    "@xcite compares low resolution spectra and colors of a selection of l dwarfs to models of allard , hauschildt , & schweitzer ( 2000 ) to derive @xmath10 for several objects .",
    "their spectral synthesis fitting gave an estimated @xmath10 of 1800 - 1900 k for the entire l dwarf sequence ( l0 to l8 ) .",
    "comparison of observed fluxes to evolution models by @xcite resulted in @xmath10 ranging from 2050 - 2350 k for l0 to 1400 to 1600 k for l7 .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath10 on the @xcite scale varies from about 2200 k ( l0 ) to 1600 k ( l6 ) .",
    "the above @xmath10 estimates are all based on fits to the  cleared dust \" models of @xcite which do not include dust in the radiative transfer . since the @xcite models do include dust opacity , accounting for sedimentation , the atmosphere models are warmer at fixed @xmath10 than comparable cleared - dust models by several hundred degrees .",
    "thus the @xmath10 range implied by eq . 1 is cooler and may be more reasonable .",
    "our estimated effective temperatures are somewhat higher , particularly for the later - type objects , then those of @xcite who derive temperatures of 2200 k for m9.5 to 1200 k for l7 based on spectral synthesis fitting of far optical spectra using dusty atmosphere models .",
    "we note that their fitted @xmath10 depends sensitively upon the treatment of dust and alkali gas opacity as well as the inclusion of an unknown `` additional opacity '' .",
    "in contrast the models of @xcite fit both the optical and near - infrared colors of l dwarfs by including a more physically - based description of condensate sedimentation and properly accounting for chemical equilibrium with cloud formation . both dust sedimentation and the chemical equilibrium treatment of alkali metal opacity become more important with later l spectral type @xcite .",
    "these effects are likely responsible for the discrepancies between our results .",
    "we find that the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) and ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) colors become redder with later l - dwarf spectral type .",
    "similarly the ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) color of the t dwarfs steadily reddens by a full magnitude over the range of objects observed , and this color may prove useful in the future classification and determination of effective temperature in t dwarfs .",
    "we find that ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) for the early t dwarfs is bluer than ( _ k_-@xmath4 ) for the latest l dwarfs due to @xmath1 absorption but that a gradual transition between the two spectral classes is not seen .",
    "this suggests that perhaps very early t dwarfs or very late l dwarfs have yet to be found or that @xmath1 absorption appears rapidly over a very small effective temperature range . by using the observed ( _ k - l@xmath3 _ ) colors and theoretical models which include dust opacity and account for cloud sedimentation @xcite",
    ", we estimate an @xmath10 range of 2200 k to 1400 k for the entire l - dwarf spectral sequence ( l0 to l8 ) .    we thank sandy leggett for helpful comments and advice .",
