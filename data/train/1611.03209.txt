    "<S> a quantum state is fully characterized by its density matrix or equivalently by its quasiprobabilities in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> a scheme to identify the quasiprobabilities of a quantum state is an important tool in the recent development of quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> based on our highly efficient vacuum measurement scheme , we measure the quasiprobability @xmath0-function of the vibrational motion for a @xmath1ion _ resonantly _ interacting with its internal energy states . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction model is known as the jaynes - cummings model which is one of the fundamental models in quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the capability of the vacuum measurement to study the jaynes - cummings dynamics , where the gaussian peak of the initial coherent state is known to bifurcate and rotate around the origin of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> they merge at the so - called revival time at the other side of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath0-function agrees with the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we reconstruct the wigner function by deconvoluting the @xmath0-function and observe the quantum interference in the wigner function at half of the revival time , where the vibrational state becomes nearly disentangled from the internal energy states and forms a superposition of two composite states . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme can be applied to other physical setups including cavity or circuit - qed and optomechanical systems .    </S>",
    "<S> reconstructing the state of a quantum system through measurements reveals all the statistical properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus schemes to reconstruct a quantum state are useful , for example , to ensure the quantum state generated and to test the fidelity of quantum operations . the quantum state is equivalently represented by its density matrices or quasiprobability functions in phase space @xcite . among the quasiprobability functions , the wigner function has been used mainly for the study of non - classicality of the state , which is manifested by negativities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-function has been used to study the essence of the dynamics of a quantum - state evolution in phase space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there have been many developments in reconstructing the state of a quantum field in various physical systems including photonic systems @xcite , atomic systems @xcite , molecular systems @xcite , trapped ion systems @xcite , cavity - qed @xcite and circuit - qed systems @xcite , which are mostly related to the reconstruction of wigner functions by the parity measurements of the states .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-function requires only the measurement of the vacuum component of the field , which looks relatively easy to implement . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of the @xmath0-function also does not require a heavy numerical process as the probability of the state being in the vacuum is the value of the @xmath0-function in each point of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> however , the measurement of the vacuum state is not straightforward . in a cavity , as an example , the existence of a photon can be detected by an atomic state through an atom - photon interaction like jaynes - cummings model ( jcm)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the cavity has no photons , an atom initially prepared in its ground state will remain there forever . </S>",
    "<S> however , by merely measuring the atom in its ground state we can not say that the cavity is empty because the rabi oscillations periodically bring the atom back to the ground state even with many photons in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation frequency depends on how many photons are present in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the authors in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrated a scheme of vacuum measurement that works for their particular cavity - qed system . </S>",
    "<S> for the circuit - qed system @xcite , a measurement of the vacuum component and the @xmath0-function reconstruction was demonstrated based on the system - specific strong - nonlinear coupling between the cavity mode and the artificial atom . </S>",
    "<S> recently a generic scheme of the vacuum measurement was proposed for the cavity - qed system with the standard jcm coupling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while it is desirable to find the @xmath0-function and the wigner function based on one set of measurement , this has not been achieved due to the measurement inefficiencies of the vacuum state . here , we report a generic and efficient detection of vacuum with 98.5@xmath2 efficiency for the phononic states in the vibrational mode of a harmonic trap , which is realized by the adiabatic passage schemes @xcite based on counter - diabatic methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the demonstrated adiabatic passages have been significantly improved in order to measure the vacuum component of a reasonably large phonon state up to @xmath3 phonons . </S>",
    "<S> typically , in trapped ion systems , phonon number distributions are measured by the fourier transformation of the phonon - number dependent rabi oscillations @xcite . for this </S>",
    "<S> , a long observation time is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme does not require such a long observation time , but at each measurement , we obtain a binary result ; the vacuum or the complementary states . </S>",
    "<S> we simply need to repeat the measurement sequence for the probabilities of the vacuum state , which by nature of the measurement excludes the negativity problem of the @xmath0-function shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we efficiently measure the vacuum probabilities in phase space to observe the dynamics of the jcm field . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath0-function is highly accurate , which enables us to reconstruct the density matrix and the wigner function by its deconvolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show a good agreement of our quasiprobabilities with the theoretical predictions .     </S>",

    "<S> raman laser beams , which have @xmath5 polarization and are detunned by @xmath6 12.9 thz from the @xmath7 manifold , perform anti - jcm , displacement operation and the vacuum measurement by adjusting their beating frequencies ( see method a ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the vacuum component is measured by transferring the population of @xmath8 to that of @xmath9 for any value of @xmath10 at the same duration of pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the atom remaining in no fluorescence state @xmath11 indicates the phononic state being in @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the uniform transfer for any phononic state @xmath13 to @xmath14 is accomplished by the scheme of shortcuts to the adiabaticity , where @xmath15 khz , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the total duration @xmath18s . </S>",

    "<S> the points with error bars are the experimental results while the dashed lines are by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are obtained by the standard deviation of the quantum projection noise with 100 repetitions . </S>",

    "<S> more recently , the model has been widely studied for its rich properties of quantum control , coherent superposition and entanglement which are closely related to the current development of quantum technology . in order to see the nonclassical effects due to quantum interaction , the jcm </S>",
    "<S> is often studied with the state initially prepared in a coherent field and the atom in its energy eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the field and the atom are entangled @xcite as soon as the interaction starts , but at a certain time they are nearly disentangled to bring the field into a superposition of two coherent states of a @xmath21 phase difference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> earlier , eiselt and risken @xcite showed that the gaussian probability distribution of the initial coherent state in phase space breathe at the initial points of interaction , reflecting the rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> then the gaussian peak bifurcates to travel around a circle in opposite direction in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the bifurcation is a consequence of quantum nature of interaction and was experimentally probed through the measurement of field phase distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the full reconstruction of the dynamics of the jcm field has not been experimentally demonstrated .    </S>",

    "<S> the jcm and anti - jcm dynamics share more or less the same behavior . for technical reasons , we perform experiments for the anti - jcm interaction .     </S>",

    "<S> all the phonon states except the vacuum component @xmath40 are in the bright electronic state @xmath41 , which emits photons during the standard fluorescence detection sequence . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the atom being in the dark electronic state @xmath11 after the uniform transfer indicates the phonon state in the vacuum . by measuring the vacuum probability of the state after displacing it by @xmath42 , we can directly measure the @xmath0-function @xmath43 . </S>",

    "<S> the main limitation of the current demonstration comes from the unreliable displacement operation above @xmath81 , which is caused by heating of the phonon mode and going outside lamb - dicke regime of the phonon state . </S>",
