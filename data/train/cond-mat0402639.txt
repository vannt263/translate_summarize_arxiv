    "in the past decade , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been studied extensively because of their unconventional properties from both the fundamental research and application point of view  @xcite . for the application to nanoscale electronic devices ,",
    "researchers have fabricated various forms of cnts to engineer their physical properties .",
    "@xmath2-bonded carbon nanostructures have been found to coalesce by electron beam irradiation at high temperature and new morphologies such as x- and t - shaped junctions have been produced  @xcite .",
    "these developments offer interesting opportunities to study phase - coherent transport in novel geometries . thus far ,",
    "phase - coherent transport has been most actively studied in the semiconductor heterostructures by employing the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer @xcite with an embedded quantum dot in one arm .",
    "the measured phase in the open geometry ( as in double - slit experiments ) is featured with a smooth increase at the resonant tunneling and an abrupt jump by 180@xmath3 at transmission zeroes . in the closed or unitary geometry",
    ", the conductance generally exhibits the fano line shape  @xcite .",
    "the fano effect usually arises from the coherent interference between a narrow localized level ( quantum dot ) and a continuum energy spectrum ( the arm without a quantum dot )  @xcite .",
    "the fano effect has also been identified in the direct transport through a single quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "the cnt is excellent for observing phase coherence phenomena and there are some experimental signatures of the fano effect in the cnts  @xcite , though the detailed mechanism is not fully understood .    in this paper , we report transport properties of a multiply connected carbon nanotube ( mccn ) structure as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where a single tube is branched off into two smaller arms and then they merge into one  @xcite .",
    "we have studied conductance variation systematically by changing the length of the arms . both @xmath1-bonding and @xmath4(@xmath1 anti)-bonding electron transport channels show resonant tunneling through discrete energy levels(dels ) in the finite arms .",
    "the width of the resonant tunneling peaks in the @xmath1 channel is broad and the transmission probability is fairly uniform as a function of energy . the @xmath4 channel , on the other hand , has more interesting structure of either broad or narrow resonant tunneling as will be shown later .",
    "coherent interference between a very broad level ( extending over to nearby levels ) and its narrow neighboring level is evident in the asymmetric fano - type line shapes of the @xmath4 transport channel and the corresponding transmission probability is featured with both zero and unity . in particular , we find a nearly perfect suppression of the @xmath4 transmission in a certain finite range of energy .",
    "this mechanism can be regarded as electron filtering of a particular wave function character ( @xmath1-pass filter ) , and such a nonequilibrium distribution may be maintained over the relaxation length of the electron phase beyond the arm region .",
    "our model system , the mccn , comprises two leads of semi - infinite metallic ( 10,10 ) cnts and two arms of finite ( 5,5 ) tubes ( effectively a resistive region ) of the same length in between .",
    "this structure may be thought as two y - junctions faced to each other , possibly produced experimentally by electron irradiation on nanotubes .",
    "six heptagons are contained in each of two junction regions where the ( 10,10 ) tube and two ( 5,5 ) tubes are joined .",
    "the length of the arm region is represented by the number ( @xmath5 ) of periodic units of the armchair cnt as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this structure possesses the mirror symmetry with respect to three planes .",
    "two symmetry planes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are , respectively , perpendicular to and containing the ( 10,10 ) tube axis , are indicated in fig .",
    "1 . the third one is the plane of the figure containing the tube axis ( not indicated in fig .",
    "the electronic structure is described by the single @xmath1-electron tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 denote the nearest neighbor pairs , the hopping integral @xmath10 ev  @xcite and the on - site energy is set to zero .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath1 and @xmath4 bands are crossing at the fermi level ( @xmath11 ) in the armchair cnts as shown in fig .",
    "a @xmath1-bonding state consists of @xmath12 orbitals having the same phase all across the circumference of the tube . in a @xmath1-antibonding ( @xmath4 ) state , on the other hand",
    ", the constituent @xmath12 orbitals have alternating signs ( 180@xmath13 out of phase ) along the circumference of the tube . @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath4 states are usually admixed when defects are introduced into the perfectly periodic nanotubes .",
    "however , @xmath1 and @xmath4 transport channels remain unmixed in our mccn because of the @xmath14 symmetry of the structure . only if @xmath1 and @xmath4 states are unmixed , the effect of interference among different levels becomes pronounced and dramatic ( e.g. , complete suppression of transmission of a level ) as described below . furthermore , because two arms are of the same length , we can focus on other effects than the traditional ab interference due to the path length difference . in our scattering - state approach ,",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation for the whole system by matching the solutions of the tight - binding hamiltonian in the arm region with that of the lead region at each interface .",
    "for given incoming electron waves from the left lead as initial conditions , we obtain the transmitted electrons emerging on the right lead .",
    "conductance is obtained from the landauer - bttiker formula , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the conductance quantum ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the transmission matrix  @xcite .",
    "we do not include here extra contact resistance that may arise between external metallic leads and the mccn .",
    "the conductance as a function of the incident electron energy is displayed in fig . 3 for the cases of @xmath19  5 , 9 and 12 .",
    "to examine the structure of the conductance in detail , total conductance is decomposed into two nonmixing contributions of @xmath1 and @xmath4 channels , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the transmission probabilities of the two .",
    "we find the following features common to various @xmath5 s .",
    "( i ) @xmath21 has peaks of magnitude one always and varies very slowly as a function of energy .",
    "( ii ) @xmath22 has both broad and narrow peaks of magnitude one always , and the line shape is highly asymmetric , especially for narrow peaks .",
    "( iii ) @xmath21 has no zeroes within the interested energy window while @xmath22 is featured with zeroes near the narrow asymmetric peaks .",
    "since the wave function of a @xmath1 state does not have phase variation in the circumferential direction ( i.e. , the same sign over the cross - section of the tube ) irrespective of @xmath23 in ( @xmath23,@xmath23 ) tubes , the @xmath1 wave function in the lead part ( ( 10,10 ) tube ) has almost perfect match with that in the arms ( two ( 5,5 ) tubes ) , and the transmission is close to unity in a wide range of energy .",
    "in contrast , the conduction of @xmath4 electrons is more complicated because the wave function in the lead part can not match that of the two - arms region due to the phase variation along the circumferential direction as mentioned before .",
    "the conducting behavior may be explained by a close examination of the resonant tunneling through the dels which are accommodated in the arms of ( 5,5 ) tubes .",
    "each junction area acts as an effective scattering center for @xmath4 electrons .",
    "thus the mccn structure may be regarded as a double - wall quantum well and we expect the energy quantization by confinement to a finite region of the arms . with increasing length @xmath5 of ( 5,5 ) tubes ,",
    "the spacing between peaks becomes smaller .",
    "peaks for the @xmath4 states in fig .",
    "3 show this trend unambiguously .",
    "( @xmath1 electrons also experience resonant tunneling via dels as exemplified in the series of peaks of magnitude unity",
    ". however , their line width is so broad that the variation in the conductance is small and uninteresting . )",
    "the spectrum of dels can be roughly estimated from the linear dispersion  @xcite near @xmath11 for the ideal armchair nanotube , @xmath24 (= 2.46  ) is the lattice constant and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the fermi wave vector .",
    "approximate values of the spectrum of dels are found from the quantization condition @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the effective length of the arm and @xmath29 is positive integer .",
    "for instance , if we took @xmath30 for @xmath31 , the dels near @xmath11 would be @xmath320.93 , @xmath320.37 , 0.19 , and 0.74 ev . a better fitting to the exact numerical calculation in fig .",
    "4(a ) could be obtained if we assumed a longer effective length @xmath33 , in which case we would have @xmath320.82 , @xmath320.32 , 0.18 , and 0.68 ev .",
    "this result is reasonable since the electrons localized in the central ring region are somewhat spread out beyond the arms as seen , for instance , in the last picture of fig .",
    "this simple model based on the linear dispersion , of course , has a limitation of obtaining , incorrectly , the same energy separations only .",
    "coupling to the left and right leads results in the finite lifetime ( line broadening ) of the dels . to understand the variation of the line width from peak to peak , we further investigate the structure of the wave functions at the resonant peaks .",
    "besides the linear @xmath1 and @xmath4 bands crossing at @xmath11 , there exist a conduction band at 0.8 ev and above , and a valence band at @xmath320.8 ev and below in the ( 10,10 ) tube . because of the presence of the heptagonal carbon rings at the junction , donorlike states tend to be produced according to well - known hckel s ( @xmath34 ) rule for stability  @xcite .",
    "the cycloheptatrienyl cation is a molecular example of the heptagonal ring following hckel s rule for @xmath35 .",
    "the localized impurity ( donor ) state is most pronounced if the energy level is close to ( and below ) aforementioned conduction band minimum at 0.8 ev .",
    "such localized donorlike states have in fact been found in other defects ( nitrogen impurity and stone - wales defect ) of the nanotube as well  @xcite .",
    "the peak c in fig .",
    "4 ( or sharp peaks closest to 0.8 ev in fig .",
    "3 ) corresponds to this state and has a narrow line shape owing to the relatively well - localized ( long lifetime ) character of such an origin .",
    "the dels further away from the conduction band minimum are less localized and thus broader .",
    "we also compare the wave functions around the peaks and the nodes of the conductance curve .",
    "the wave functions at peaks of @xmath22 have large amplitude in two arms so that incident electrons are in resonance with the states in the region .",
    "in contrast , the wave functions of the @xmath0 band at the u - shaped valley ( e.g. , at 0.46 ev in fig .",
    "4(b ) ) are depleted inside two arms , which means an effective disconnection of two leads and the suppression of the electron conduction .",
    "unlike in the @xmath1 electron case , the phase variation across the cross - section of the tube is very rapid in the @xmath4 state and it is very difficult to match the wave function at the junction boundary for a general value of energy , hence substantial reduction in conductance .",
    "so far , we have accounted for the interesting phenomenon of line width variations from level to level .",
    "such a variation leads to even more profound consequences on the structure of the transmission probability as we shall describe below . in the 1d mesoscopic systems such as the double - barrier quantum wells , if all the dels are coupled to the continuum of lead states with almost the same coupling strength and the relative signs of couplings to two leads are alternating from level to level",
    ", the transmission zero does not occur @xcite .",
    "however , when one energy level is coupled by far more strongly to the leads and acts like a broad band interfering with other narrow levels , the transmission zero may take place @xcite .",
    "our system falls in the latter case . as the energy of the dels",
    "is increased , the number of nodes along the two arms increases one by one and in turn the relative signs of the wave functions at two junctions are oscillating for dels .",
    "the dels in the arm region are coupled to the left and right ( 10,10 ) tube leads with the same coupling strength but with variable signs .",
    "the signs of the coupling constants at both junctions are determined by the parity of the wave functions with respect to the reflection symmetry plane , @xmath6 . for an even - parity state ,",
    "the signs of coupling constants at two junctions are the same , but they are opposite for an odd - parity state .",
    "this alternating parity under @xmath6 symmetry operation is clearly visible in fig .",
    "4(b ) for dels at @xmath320.32 ( even ) , 0.18 ( odd ) , and 0.59 ev ( even ) . in the presence of the @xmath6 symmetry ( plus the time - reversal symmetry which obviously exists in the absence of applied magnetic fields )",
    ", it is well known that the perfect transmission ( @xmath36 ) is allowed to occur at all resonant peaks in the system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the transmission zero is generally not allowed in the energy range between one level and its nearest neighbor level interfering each other  @xcite .",
    "it is only when a broad level extends beyond the nearest neighbor narrow level that a transmission zero occurs at the energy between its nearest and _ next nearest neighbor _ narrow level .    to confirm this argument",
    ", we fit the curve of @xmath22 for @xmath37 with the multilevel generalization of the green s function formula  @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath38 contains , as parameters , dels ( @xmath39 ) and coupling constants to right(@xmath40 ) and left leads(@xmath41 )  @xcite . @xmath42",
    "@xmath43^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the coupling matrix between the resistive and lead region on the left or right , @xmath45 is the retarded or advanced green s function , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the density of states in the lead on the left or right ( @xmath49 in the present case ) .",
    "we use seven dels and their diagonal components of @xmath50 .",
    "values of dels ( @xmath51 ) in ev are as follows : @xmath321.330(0.139 ) , @xmath320.859(0.194 ) , @xmath320.300(0.132 ) , 0.178(0.025 ) , 0.584(0.013 ) , 1.100(0.183 ) , and 1.700(0.250 ) .",
    "the conductance curve in much wider energy range than the one presented in fig .",
    "4 has been fitted for more complete results . as mentioned above , relative signs of the wave function at two junctions alternate from one level to the next so that we set @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is 1 ( @xmath321 ) for the even ( odd ) parity state with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath50 represents the broadening of a particular level and results in the finite energy width of the conductance peak . in fig .",
    "4 , a , b , and c are the broadened peaks associated with respective dels . at a given energy , contributions from tails of",
    "two or more broadened peaks overlap and give rise to an asymmetric line shape . for instance , between a and b ( i.e. , the right - hand side of a and left - hand side of b ) , conduction paths interfere constructively and no transmission zero occurs . however , on the right - hand side of b , a and b interfere destructively ( since the energy is greater than both a and b ) and produce a transmission zero . since peak c is very narrow , its constructive interference on b ( in the energy range between b and c ) is much less than the destructive interference from a and unable to change the result .",
    "in fact , there are two transmission zeroes between b and c , one nearer to b which is obtained as above and the other nearer to c which is obtained by the destructive interference between c and the next broad peak above c ( not shown ) . here",
    "we emphasize that the transmission zeroes result from the interference between the abstract conduction paths through the energy levels in the hilbert space .",
    "the curve fitting with eq.(3 ) is practically indistinguishable from the @xmath4-channel conductance of our mccn , indicating that the simple model with the multilevel transmission formula is valid for explaining the fano resonance structures and the transmission zeroes .",
    "we also observe that , in a certain finite energy range , the conductance of @xmath4 electrons is almost zero while that of @xmath1 electrons is not reduced appreciably .",
    "for instance , the transmitted electrons of @xmath4 character for @xmath54 in fig .",
    "3(a ) constitute less than 8% of the total transmitted electrons in the energy range between 0 and 0.5 ev .",
    "this may be regarded as orbital filtering of a particular wave function character ( @xmath1-pass filter ) .",
    "this result can be used for a further fundamental research on the orbital character in nanostructures or an application to current switching in nanotubes .",
    "we have carried out tight - binding calculations of conductance of multiply connected metallic cnts with the mirror symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 channel is well - conducting and has very broad resonance peaks .",
    "the @xmath4 channel exhibits fano resonance structures .",
    "the fano effect originates from the interference between broad and narrow electronic levels in the arm region .",
    "it is shown that the present system transmits predominantly @xmath1 over @xmath4 electrons in a certain energy range .",
