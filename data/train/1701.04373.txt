    "nature is quantum in its essence , although classical theories may be employed under certain conditions . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "the temperature range becomes crucial for the use of classical or quantum approaches .",
    "typical examples appear in magnetism , where the use of classical models is justified when the temperature ranges are high enough , when compared to some reference temperature . in many magnetic systems",
    "the quantum effects become relevant , and should be taken into account , like those within the realm of quantum magnetism  @xcite .    in what concerns spin glasses ( sgs ) ,",
    "models based on ising variables have been able to describe fairly well , at least qualitatively , a wide variety of experimental behavior , even for sufficiently low temperatures  .",
    "some of these results have been obtained at mean - field level , based on the infinite - range - interaction sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model  @xcite , either by means of the replica - symmetric ( rs ) , or replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) , solutions  @xcite .",
    "although this may seem paradoxical , due to the fact that ising sg hamiltonians are not formulated in terms of quantum operators , it is understood since their binary variables capture an essential ingredient of many physical systems , for which strong anisotropy fields are present , leading to two significant states associated with the spin operators . however , in some compounds , the quantum fluctuations controlled by a given parameter ( e.g. , magnetic field , and/or doping ) depress the transition temperature @xmath14 , changing radically the physical properties of the system  @xcite . in some cases",
    ", a field transverse to such spin operators appears to be relevant , and so , the simpler ising sg hamiltonian should be replaced by a quantum type of hamiltonian .",
    "the ising dipolar - coupled ferromagnet lihof@xmath6 is a well known system in which quantum fluctuations become important by applying a transverse magnetic field @xmath15 , which induces quantum tunnelling through the barrier separating the two degenerate ground states of ho@xmath16 ions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , disorder can be introduced , by replacing the magnetic ho@xmath16 ions by nonmagnetic y@xmath16 ones .",
    "therefore , the resulting liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 compound is considered as an ideal ground for investigating the interplay between quantum fluctuations and disorder in ising spins systems  @xcite .    in these physical systems , coefficients of the expansion of the magnetization @xmath17 , in powers of a small external longitudinal field @xmath18 , are quantities of great interest  @xcite , @xmath19 corresponding to the linear susceptibility , @xmath20 and nonlinear susceptibilities , @xmath21 since measurements of @xmath22 ( and higher - order susceptibilities ) may become a hard task , very frequently in the literature one refers to @xmath23 as the nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 is directly related to the sg susceptibility  @xcite , @xmath24 with the latter representing an important theoretical tool , being defined as @xmath25_{\\rm av}~ ,   \\label{sgchi}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27_{\\rm av}$ ] denote , respectively , thermal averages and an average over the disorder",
    ".    in fact , the interplay between quantum fluctuations and disorder stands for the physical origin of the intriguing behavior found in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath23 of liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 , which has been the object of a considerable experimental and theoretical debate . in the absence of @xmath15 ,",
    "the liho@xmath28y@xmath29f@xmath6 compound displays a sharp peak in @xmath23 at the temperature @xmath14 , which resembles a conventional second - order sg phase transition  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the sharp peak of @xmath23 becomes increasingly rounded when the transverse field @xmath15 is applied and enhanced , so that the resulting smooth curve presents a maximum located at a temperature @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "such behavior was initially interpreted as a changing in the nature of the transition , from second order at @xmath14 to first order at @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "more recently , jnsson and collaborators  @xcite investigated the behavior of @xmath23 for dopings @xmath32 and @xmath33 , obtaining the same roundings of the peak in both cases ; these authors understood this behavior as an evidence of absence of a sg phase transition of any nature .",
    "in contrast , ancona - torres and collaborators  @xcite performed measurements for doping @xmath34 , not only of @xmath23 , but also of @xmath22 , as well as of the ac susceptibility , reasserting @xmath30 as the sg critical temperature .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the debate on this particular issue has also been intense ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "the suggestion that an effective longitudinal random field ( rf ) @xmath35 can be induced from the interplay of a transverse applied field @xmath15 , with the off - diagonal terms of the dipolar interactions in liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 , represents a very interesting hint to clarify these controversies concerning the meaning of @xmath30  @xcite . according to the droplet picture for sgs , the rounded behavior of @xmath23 in the presence of the field - induced rf @xmath35 is interpreted as a suppression of the sg transition  @xcite , similar to what a uniform field does in that picture  @xcite . on the other hand , tabei and collaborators  @xcite working within parisi s mean - field theory  @xcite , using an effective hamiltonian defined in terms of the field - induced rf @xmath35 and a transverse field @xmath0 [ where @xmath36 represents some monotonically increasing function of @xmath15 ] , reproduced quite well the experimental behavior of @xmath23 , with an increasingly rounded peak at @xmath30 when @xmath15 is enhanced .",
    "it should be remarked that the results described above are based on a particular approach of the quantum sk model proposed by kim and collaborators  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the sk model is analyzed in the presence of a transverse field @xmath0 , within the static approximation .",
    "mostly important , a region inside the sg phase was found where the rs approximation is stable .",
    "actually , the rsb solution exists only for sufficiently low values of @xmath0 , at temperatures lower than the sg transition temperature .",
    "the main consequence of this scenario is that the sharp peak of @xmath23 , which signals the sg phase transition temperature , does not coincide with the onset of rsb . nevertheless , this result is also highly controversial , since other works indicate precisely the opposite , i.e. , the rs approximation is unstable throughout the whole sg phase ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) except , possibly , at the zero - temperature quantum critical point ( qcp )  @xcite . consequently , when @xmath0 enhances , the rsb transition temperature @xmath14 decreases , so that , for finite temperatures , the critical behavior appears in @xmath23 as @xmath38^{-\\delta^{\\prime}}~ ,    \\label{x3critic}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the critical value of @xmath0 for a given temperature , from which its corresponding value at the zero - temperature qcp is obtained as @xmath40 .    in the classical case",
    ", it is well known that @xmath41 is inversely proportional to the almeida - thouless eigenvalue @xmath3 , the so - called replicon  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the diverging behavior of @xmath23 at the sg transition , @xmath42^{-\\gamma}~ ,    \\label{x3critic1}\\ ] ] is a direct consequence of @xmath43 at @xmath14 , occurring together with the onset of rsb .",
    "similarly , in the quantum case , one expects that the divergence of @xmath23 at @xmath39 should coincide with the onset of rsb .",
    "indeed , the presence of a rf can produce deep changes in the scenario described previously .",
    "for instance , in the classical sk model  @xcite , the rf induces the rs order parameter @xmath44 , which becomes finite at any temperature  @xcite . as a consequence , @xmath44 versus temperature presents a smooth behavior , being no more appropriate for identifying a sg transition in the sk model .",
    "nevertheless , such a transition may still be related with the onset of rsb , signaled by @xmath43  @xcite . in spite of this , the derivative of @xmath44 with respect to the temperature increases as one approaches @xmath8 from above ; such an increase is the ultimate responsible for the rounded maximum in @xmath23 at the temperature @xmath30 , which does not coincide with the sg transition temperature @xmath14 ( @xmath45 ) . in fact , the maximum value of @xmath23 at @xmath30 reflects the effects of the rf inside the paramagnetic phase , instead of the non - trivial ergodicity breaking of the sg phase transition  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can raise the question of whether such scenario for @xmath23 , found in the classical sk model , is robust in the corresponding quantum model , when the transverse field is considered , i.e. , @xmath46 , and no longer independent from the rf , as proposed by tabei and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study the susceptibility @xmath23 , using the so - called fermionic ising sg model in the presence of a longitudinal rf @xmath35 and a transverse field @xmath0 . in this model ,",
    "the spin operators are written in terms of fermionic occupation and destruction operators  @xcite , whereas the spin - spin couplings @xmath47 and random fields @xmath48 follow gaussian distributions .",
    "the grand - canonical potential is obtained in the functional integral formalism , and the disorder is treated using the replica method ; moreover , the sg order parameters are obtained in the static approximation  @xcite and investigated within the one - step rsb scheme  @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that the fermionic ising sg model is defined on the fock space , where there are four possible states per site : one state with no fermions , two states with a single fermion , and one state with two fermions , leading to two nonmagnetic states .",
    "in particular , one can consider two cases : the @xmath49 model that allows the four possible states per site and the @xmath50 model , which restricts the spin operators to act on a space where the nonmagnetic states are forbidden . in the present work we will consider the later model , by imposing a restriction to remove the contribution of these nonmagnetic states , i.e. , taking into account only the sites occupied by one fermion in the partition - function trace  @xcite .    in order to deal appropriately with the experimental behavior of @xmath23 in the liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 compound , we focus our calculations on the 2s model by proposing a relationship between @xmath2 ( the width of the distribution of random fields @xmath35 ) and @xmath0 , following the approach introduced by tabei and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic observed experimentally in @xmath23 concerns the peak for small @xmath15 ( classical limit ) being replaced by a rounded maximum which becomes increasingly rounded for large @xmath15 ( quantum limit ) . besides the progressive smearing of @xmath23 , the amplitude of its maximum also decreases as @xmath15 increases .",
    "therefore , the effects of the rf triggered by @xmath15 , as suggested by tabei and collaborators @xcite , should provoke simultaneously both effects , i.e. , the smearing of the peak and the decrease of the maximum amplitude value of @xmath23 . for the present fermionic ising sg model , we have tested a relationship involving @xmath2 and @xmath0 , particularly in the power - like form , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents the width of the gaussian distribution for the couplings @xmath47 .",
    "considering the interval for the exponent , @xmath53 , we have been able to obtain @xmath23 as a function of temperature and @xmath0 resembling qualitatively the experimental behavior for @xmath23 described above .",
    "as already mentioned , the transverse field @xmath0 used in the effective model to describe liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 is expected to be related to the experimental applied field @xmath15  @xcite ; in fact , at least for low @xmath15 , @xmath54 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we define the model and find its grand - canonical potential within the one - step rsb scheme ; in section iii we present a detailed discussion of the order parameters , the susceptibility @xmath23 , and some phase diagrams .",
    "finally , the last section is reserved to conclusions .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath55 where the summation @xmath56 applies to all distinct pairs of spin operators , whereas the couplings @xmath47 and magnetic fields @xmath48 are quenched random variables , following independent gaussian distributions , @xmath57^{1/2 }   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{n}{32j^{2}}\\left(j_{ij } -j_0/n \\right)^{2}\\right]~ , \\label{eq2a}\\ ] ] and @xmath58^{1/2 }   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{32\\delta^{2 } } h_i^{2 } \\right]~.   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] in order to obtain susceptibilities [ cf .",

    "it should be emphasized that the temperature @xmath10 plays a role different from @xmath8 , in the sense that it does not correspond to a phase transition , but rather to a crossover between two distinct regions of the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the previous analysis of the sk model in the presence of a gaussian random field ref .",
    "@xcite , which should correspond herein to the region of high temperatures and low @xmath0 ( i.e. , the classical regime ) , has also found a temperature @xmath10 , associated with the rounded maximum of @xmath23 , with @xmath11 . in this case , @xmath10 was interpreted as an effect of the rfs acting inside the paramagnetic phase , instead of some type of non - trivial ergodicity breaking .",
    "herein , we claim that the temperature @xmath10 , although it may be also affected by the transverse field @xmath0 , should be interpreted in a similar manner . hence , along the line signaled by @xmath8 , the growth of @xmath0 produces an enhancement of quantum fluctuations , which become increasingly dominant as compared with thermal fluctuations , driving the non - trivial ergodicity breaking of the sg phase transition to a qcp . for temperatures in the region",
    "@xmath12 , the enhancement of quantum fluctuations by @xmath0 along with the spin fluctuations due to the rfs inside the paramagnetic phase create two distinct scenarios , more precisely concerning the pm1 region , as discussed next : ( a ) for fixed @xmath2 [ e.g. , fig .  [ fig6](a ) ] , one has @xmath0 and @xmath2 independent , so that the smearing of the nonlinear susceptibility is caused only by the rfs , leading to the effect that the full and dashed lines remain essentially parallel to one another , up to zero temperature ; ( b ) the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , for which @xmath2 and @xmath0 are related through the parabolic behavior shown in the inset , the appearance of @xmath10 occurs for @xmath139 ( i.e. , @xmath184 ) .",
    "hence , the region pm1 starts very narrow for low @xmath0 , and gets enlarged for increasing values of @xmath0 , showing that the rounding of @xmath23 is dominated by the enhancement of the rfs , leading to spins fluctuations due to the rfs inside the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we have investigated a quantum spin - glass model in the presence of a uniform transverse field @xmath0 , as well as of a longitudinal random field @xmath1 , the later following a gaussian distribution characterized by a width proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the model was considered in the limit of infinite - range interactions and studied through the replica formalism , within a one - step replica - symmetry - breaking procedure .",
    "the spin - glass critical frontier , signaled by the temperature @xmath8 , was identified with the onset of replica - symmetry breaking , calculated through the almeida - thouless eigenvalue ( replicon ) @xmath3 , i.e. , by setting @xmath43 . in this approach , the whole spin - glass phase becomes characterized by @xmath181 , and consequently , it was treated through replica - symmetry breaking .",
    "such analysis was motivated by experimental investigations on the liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 compound . in this system ,",
    "the application of a transverse magnetic field yields rather intriguing effects , particularly related to the behavior of the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility @xmath7 , which have led to a considerable experimental and theoretical debate .",
    "we have analyzed two physically distinct situations , namely , @xmath2 and @xmath0 considered as independent , as well as these two quantities related , as proposed recently by some authors ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "we have found a spin - glass critical frontier , given by @xmath185 , with such phase being characterized by a nontrivial ergodicity breaking . in the first case , for @xmath2 fixed",
    ", we have found that @xmath186 decreases by increasing @xmath0 towards a quantum critical point at zero temperature , whereas in the second , we have found a similar behavior for this critical frontier , with @xmath2 changing according to variations in @xmath0 . in this later case , we have taken into account previous experimental investigations  @xcite which suggest that a relation of the type @xmath162 should satisfy certain requirements , e.g. , @xmath2 should increase monotonically with @xmath0 , and one should get @xmath129 for @xmath128 .",
    "although such a relation may not be unique , the simplest proposal following such conditions appears to be a power function , @xmath163 . in the present work ,",
    "the parameters @xmath164 and @xmath165 were computed by adjusting our results to those of the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to the the optimal values @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "we have shown that the present approach , considering the relation @xmath179 , was able to reproduce adequately the experimental observations on the liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 compound , with theoretical results coinciding qualitatively with measurements of the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath7 . as a consequence , by increasing @xmath0 gradually ,",
    "our results indicate that @xmath7 becomes progressively rounded , presenting a maximum at a temperature @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ; moreover , both amplitude of the maximum and the value of @xmath10 diminish , by enhancing @xmath0 .    from the analysis where @xmath2 and @xmath0 are considered as independent ,",
    "we have concluded that the random field is the main responsible for the smearing of the nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "hence , the random field acts significantly inside the paramagnetic phase , leading to two regimes delimited by the temperature @xmath10 , one for @xmath12 ( called herein as pm1 ) , and another one for @xmath13 ( denominated as pm2 ) . in the paramagnetic regime for @xmath13",
    "one should have weak correlations and consequently , the usual paramagnetic type of behavior .",
    "however , close to @xmath10 , and particularly for temperatures in the range @xmath12 , one expects a rather nontrivial behavior in real systems , as happens with experiments in the compound liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 , resulting in very controversial interpretations  .",
    "hence , as already argued in the analysis of the sk model in the presence of gaussian random field  @xcite , the line pm1pm2 may not characterize a real phase transition , in the sense of a diverging @xmath7 , but the region pm1 should be certainly characterized by a rather nontrivial dynamics . as one possibility , one should have a growth of free - energy barriers in this region , leading to a slow dynamics , whereas only below @xmath8 the nontrivial ergodicity breaking appears , typical of rsb in sg systems . also , one could have griffiths singularities along pm1 , which are found currently in disordered magnetic systems , like site - diluted ferromagnets  @xcite , ferromagnet in a random field  @xcite , classical ising spin glasses  @xcite , and also claimed to occur in quantum spin glasses  @xcite . whether such curious properties may appear throughout the region pm1 in the present problem ,",
    "represents a matter for further investigation .",
    "in fact , recent experiments in the above compound for @xmath187 strongly suggest this picture  @xcite : these authors claim an `` unreachable '' transition due to an ultra - slow dynamics ( of the order @xmath188 times slower than the ones of conventional spin - glass materials ) and argue that such a dynamics should be caused by a griffiths phase between the paramagnetic and spin - glass phases .",
    "next , we discuss some contributions of the present work , as compared to previous theoretical approaches in this problem .",
    "( i ) the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite did not take into account the random field , which in our view , represents a key ingredient for an appropriate description of the properties of liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 .",
    "moreover , as it was shown herein , the rsb sg parameters , together with the magnetization @xmath17 , and the quadrupolar parameter @xmath116 , all form a set of coupled equations , to be solved simultaneously .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite considered @xmath116 as independent from the remaining parameters ; this could be directly related with the curious result concerning a part of the sg phase characterized by stability of the replica - symmetric solution , along which these authors find the rounded maximum of @xmath23 .",
    "( ii ) the study of ref .  @xcite has considered an effective hamiltonian characterized by an extra two - body interacting term ( as compared with the hamiltonian used herein ) , coupling spin operators in the @xmath107 and @xmath189 directions . moreover , these authors have suggested a relation @xmath162 , which due to the hamiltonian employed , turned out to be slightly different from ours , e.g. , @xmath163 , with an exponent @xmath190 .",
    "the results obtained herein for the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath7 corroborate those of ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , we understand that the present analysis , characterized by a single two - body interacting term , @xmath191 , leads to a much simpler analysis to the problem , when compared to the one carried in this previous work .    to conclude , we have considered a model able to reproduce theoretically many properties observed in experiments on the liho@xmath4y@xmath5f@xmath6 compound , particularly those related to the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath7 .",
    "the present theoretical proposal appears to be simpler than previous ones , and consequently , its results should be easier to compare with further experimental investigations . obviously , the observation of a clear spin - glass state , characterized by a nontrivial ergodicity breaking at a temperature @xmath8 ( below the temperature @xmath10 where one observes rounded effects on the nonlinear susceptibility ) represents a challenge for experiments .",
    "we acknowledge the partial financial support from cnpq , fapergs , faperj , and capes ( brazilian funding agencies ) .",
    "in this appendix we obtain the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath23 analytically for the 2s model , within the rs solution .",
    "although in the rs solution , these results allow us to analyze in detail how the rfs and the transverse field @xmath0 affect the nonlinear susceptibility .",
