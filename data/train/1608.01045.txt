    "one reason is that @xmath3 does not naturally cleave , which has precluded measurements of its electronic structure by momentum - resolved techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy ( si - stm ) .",
    "measurements of fractured or scraped single crystals are complicated by multiple crystallographic faces@xcite and issues with surface quality , coupled with a propensity of the @xmath3 surface to form oxides.@xcite one way of circumventing this difficulty is to synthesize epitaxial thin films and to measure them _ in situ _ with spectroscopic probes . here ,",

    "elements were co - deposited onto a rotating substrate from langmuir effusion cells at a growth rate of @xmath7 0.4 nm / min . during growth _ in situ _ reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) was used to monitor the surface evolution .",
    "after growth , the films were immediately transferred under ultra - high vacuum ( 5@xmath810@xmath12 torr ) into an analysis chamber where low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and _ in situ _ photoemission spectroscopy were performed .",

    "ex situ _ by four - circle x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using cu k@xmath13 radiation .",
    "the atomic scale structure of the @xmath3 thin film was studied by aberration - corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) and electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) performed on a fei titan themis 300 .",

    "mgo and al have a different space group ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) than that of ordered @xmath3/@xmath11 ( @xmath20@xmath19 ) , but the surface atomic arrangement of the oxygen atoms on the ( 001 ) surface of mgo and the al atoms on the aluminum ( 001 ) surface provide an excellent template for the epitaxial integration of @xmath3/@xmath11 on mgo substrates with aluminum as a buffer layer ( figs .",

    "the observed spectra show two sets of characteristic features corresponding to _ _ f__@xmath1 and _ _ f__@xmath2 final states , respectively , indicative of @xmath3 being a mixed valence compound .",
    "this is again consistent with earlier measurements of @xmath3 single crystals.@xcite spectral peaks very close to the fermi level with a binding energy of 0.03 ev and 1.34 ev , respectively , constitute features derived from yb@xmath4__f__@xmath1 final states , where the former is derived from the yb@xmath4__f__@xmath1 _ j _ = 7/2 final state , also known as the kondo resonance peak , while the latter is the spin orbit split peak derived from the yb@xmath4__f__@xmath1 _ j _ = 5/2 final state .",

    "the difference in binding energies between the bulk and surface doublets in our measurements is found to be @xmath7 0.6 ev , consistent with earlier pes measurements.@xcite spectral features observed at binding energies between 5 and 11 ev are derived from the yb@xmath5__f__@xmath2 final states .",
    "estimating the intensity of the photoemission peaks derived from yb@xmath4 and yb@xmath5 final states we obtain , in our thin films a mean yb valence of 2.78 @xmath32 0.06 at 21 k. the yb valence estimated from our thin films is consistent with earlier low energy photoemission ( 2.77 at 10 k ) @xcite and x - ray spectroscopy measurements ( 2.78 at 20 k),@xcite but is higher than that estimated from soft x - ray pes ( 2.65 at 20 k).@xcite uncertainty in background subtraction leads to an uncertainty of @xmath7 4@xmath40 in our valence estimation , but our high energy resolution allows contributions form the surface states to be easily separated from that of the bulk states .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that epitaxial thin films of @xmath3 ( 001 ) can be grown on mgo ( 001 ) by judicious choice of buffer layers and an optimized growth strategy . by providing access to pristine sample surfaces ,",
    "our thin film approach could help elucidate microscopic mechanisms underlying the properties of @xmath3 by directly measuring the single particle spectral function in both real and momentum space via surface spectroscopic probes such as arpes and stm .",
