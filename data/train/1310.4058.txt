    "the activity of gpcrs is highly selective to the type of extracellular signals @xcite , and is sensitively modulated by point mutations @xcite , the latter of which is closely related to the development of drug resistance as well @xcite . because agonist binding to orthosteric sites enables accommodation and activation of g - protein by regulating the conformational change in cytoplasmic domain @xcite , developing antagonist or agonist drugs targeting at orthosteric sites has been a straightforward strategy of drug design . such strategy , however , has often shown limited success due to the high sequence conservation among the members of a gpcr subfamily . instead , there have been several reports on the efficacy of allosteric modulators in ion - channels @xcite and other systems @xcite as well as gpcrs @xcite , which highlights the role of allosteric sites in regulating the orthosteric signaling .",
    "both orthosteric signaling and allosteric modulation are associated with long - range communications between two remote sites in the receptor structure .",
    "such communications , which are altogether referred to as allostery , could be a consequence of a special balance of intramolecular forces formed in the network of the inter - residue contacts . even though overall backbone topologies are similar between two different receptors belonging to the same subfamily",

    "protein allostery still remains elusive and stubbornly resists revealing its microscopic underpinnings . while protein mutagenesis is a standard experimental method to identify key residues for protein function , the associated experiments are laborious and time - consuming . to overcome this experimental difficulty ,",
    "there has been a growing interest in the use of theoretical / bioinformatics analysis .",
    "careful statistical evaluations of multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) of a protein family can be used to detect a set of evolutionally correlated residues @xcite .",
    "in addition , variants of normal mode analysis have been proposed to identify key residues that control  functional \" motion of enzymes and molecular motors @xcite . although a complementary use of these methods with molecular simulations would hold good promise to decipher the allosteric network of residues that are critical for the functional dynamics of proteins @xcite , a certain class of residues are still difficult to identify if the sequence conservation of the residues is too strong , or if the residues , deeply buried at the core regions of proteins , show only a minor conformational change along with the global conformational dynamics of protein .",
    "for instance , in class a gpcrs , 18 key residues buried in the tm region , called microswitches ( or rotamer toggle switches ) @xcite belong to such a class ( see below ) .    here",
    ", we propose a simple but powerful method to calculate the map of allosteric signal flow within protein structure , which identifies core allosteric sites including the above - mentioned microswitches . for a protein structure",

    "the comparison of the results from our analysis with those from other methods shows that the @xmath0-based network analysis of protein structure is much simpler , but is more reliable in identifying the allosteric hotspots that includes microswitches .",
    "furthermore , allosteric hotspots are identified from another analysis adapting the concept of network vulnerability @xcite ; and explicit calculation of individual multiple pathways linking the clusters of long - range correlated residues across transmembrane shows that majority of paths pass through the hotspot residues we predicted .",
    "the predictions from the @xmath0-based network analysis of protein structure should be of great use not only to complement mutagenesis study but also to elucidate the origin of subtype selectivity as well as the activation and regulation mechanisms of gpcrs .",

    "the whole system was energy minimized in the order of lipid membrane , waters , and the entire molecules , followed by the heating , equilibration and production runs for 300 nsec under npt ensemble .",
    "the trajectories of production run were monitored in terms of total conformational energy , tilt angle of tm6 , and root mean square deviation relative to the initial ( @xmath14 ) structure . in accord with the common notion for gpcr dynamics , the tilt angle of tm6 varied between 135@xmath15 and 150@xmath15 for the apo form , and between 120@xmath15 and 145@xmath15 for agonist - bound form ( figure [ md]b ) .",
    "finally , the minimal energy conformations from the simulated trajectories were obtained for the apo and agonist - bound forms .",

    "note that @xmath41 has the highest @xmath0 value among the whole nodes .",
    "although a few studies @xcite might appear similar in spirit to our work in that they also use centrality measures and shortest paths to decipher the allostery , it should be noted that different centrality measure has different assessment of each node .",

    "historically these residues were first identified either by evaluating the sequence conservation among the class a gpcr family or by comparing the two structures of gpcr subtype in different states ; and the functional importance of the selected residues was subsequently confirmed by mutagenesis studies @xcite .",
    "thus , a receptor belonging to the class a gpcrs is expected to utilize many of these 18 microswitches for allosteric signaling .",
    "although one should still be mindful of the fact that the functional role of these microswitches have not been verified for all the gpcr subtypes , the 18 microswitches can be used as benchmark residues to assess the performance of a prediction tool on allosteric hotspots in gpcrs ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "the extent of sequence conservation in class a gpcrs , quantified by evaluating the sequence conservation free energy @xmath55 ( eq.[eqn : seq ] ) indicates that 15 out of 18 microswitches ( except for p189 , s281 , and e228 ) satisfy @xmath56 ; thus highly conserved ( figures [ microswitch]a and [ microswitch]b ) .",

    "* in theory of complex networks , a network s tolerance to an error or vulnerability to an attack is evaluated using the relative change in the average network centrality when a node , say @xmath39 , is removed @xcite , which can be written as follows : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the average network centrality , and @xmath123 is a value evaluated for a newly constructed network when the node @xmath39 is removed from the original network .",
    "the idea of network vulnerability is , in fact , routinely practiced in molecular biology in the form of protein mutagenesis assay , which measures the effect of mutations on the degree to which proteins can retain their activity .",
    "adapting the idea of network vulnerability , we performed in silico glycine scanning of the constructed residue interaction network of the a@xmath1ar .",
    "as straightforwardly implicated by the term  glycine scanning \" , we mimicked the protein mutagenesis assay by deleting the side chain of each residue and evaluated the deletion effect on the network .",
    "our glycine scanning analysis differs from the previous study applying network analysis @xcite in that only a side chain , rather than the entire residue , is deleted for each scan .",
    "it is important to keep c@xmath2 backbone because , even in the absence of the side chain , intra - molecular residue contacts can still be formed via backbone - side chain or backbone - backbone interactions .",
    "note that here a readjustment of local environment due to the side chain removal is not considered .",
    "our aim here is to make a quantitative assessment of the role of the side chain in the original residue interaction network .",
    "the greater is the role played by the removed side chain in maintaining the network structure , the more significant would be the response of average network centrality to the removal of that particular residue .",
    "we assess the effect of deleting side chains by calculating the changes in average closeness ( @xmath124 ) or betweenness centralities ( @xmath125 ) , both of which turn out to be highly correlated ( figure [ gly]a ) .",
    "our glycine scanning analysis identified the group of residues critical for the integrity of interaction network that is responsible for the receptor allostery .",
    "the residues with strong network vulnerability ( @xmath126 ) are identified in the regions around cwxp and npxxy motifs ( figure [ gly]b ) @xcite , which retain proline that creates a kinked helix in the middle of tm6 or tm7 @xcite . in the inactive state of gpcrs ,",
    "interactions between the cytoplasmic ends of tm3 and tm6 constrain the relative motion of these segments by forming an ionic - lock between r102@xmath47 and e228@xmath127 @xcite .",
    "disruption of such constraint , triggered by agonist binding , enables tm6 to move outward from tm3 ( see dry motif & ionic lock in the figure [ microswitch]c ) .",
    "npxxy motif , which interacts with tm6 or helix 8 , imposes structural constraints in gpcrs and stabilizes the helical structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , c166 , which constrains ecl1 and ecl2 by forming a disulfide bond with c77 , is detected to have high network vulnerability .",
    "it is of note that the constrained random coil structure of ecl2 is unique to a@xmath1ar in that the ecl2 of other gpcrs typically forms @xmath128 sheet or @xmath2-helix @xcite . + * distinct @xmath0-based wiring diagrams reflect gpcr subtype specificity . * here we extend the @xmath0-based network analysis to other class a gpcrs , including @xmath129 , @xmath44 adrenergic receptors ( pdb ids : 2vt4 and 3nya ) , chemokine cxcr4 receptor ( 3odu ) , dopamine d3 receptor ( 3pbl ) , histamine h1 receptor ( 3rze ) , and bovine rhodopsin ( 1u19 ) @xcite .",
    "similar to the a@xmath1ar , the network of residues with high @xmath94 in these class a gpcrs form contiguous surface that bridges between the ligand binding and g - protein binding sites ( figure s4 ) .",
    "in most gpcrs the high c@xmath88 residues are mainly distributed around the  minor binding pocket \" , located in the shallow part of the ligand binding site between the tm1 , 2 , 3 and tm7 , which serves as an onset point of orthosteric signal transduction process @xcite . in particular , when the @xmath0 is restricted to a value greater than 0.075 , the high c@xmath88 residues bridge the extracellular region of tm3 to the tm6 , 7 helices . for the class a gpcrs ,",
    "the highly vulnerable residues identified by the glycine scanning analysis are mostly distributed in tm3 and tm7 ( figure s5 ) .",
    "note that k296@xmath72 in bovine rhodopsin , known to contribute to the activation of rhodopsin by forming a covalent bond with retinal @xcite , is also identified ( the residue marked with a yellow arrow in figure s5 g ) .",
    "along with the variation of residues ( f168 in a@xmath1ar ; r183 and y190 in cxcr4 receptor ; and k179 in h1 receptor ) and wiring diagram in ecl2 detected by glycine scanning analysis , the variations in the high c@xmath88-surfaces demonstrated in the class a gpcrs ( figure s4 ) are deemed responsible for their subtype selectivity @xcite . +",
    "* long - range transmembrane cross - correlation in the agonist - bound active state . *",
    "as suggested by the g - protein bound structure @xcite , it is expected that the agonist binding site in the extracellular side and intracellular region are functionally coupled in the active forms of gpcrs , and this coupling is mediated by a structural reorganization of seven membered tm helices . to quantify such long - range coupling in the dynamics of a@xmath1ar",
    ", we calculated cross - correlation between residues in terms of @xmath0 ( eq .",
    "2 ) by using the conformational ensemble of the a@xmath1ar generated from the 300 nsec md simulation trajectory ( see materials and methods and figure s9 ) . @xmath130 where @xmath131 refers to an ensemble average ; thus @xmath132 denotes the average betweenness centrality for the residue @xmath6 . as shown in the cross - correlation matrices for apo and agonist - bound form ( figures s6 and s7 ) , the signatures of correlation between residues are scattered all over the structure . to identify residue pairs with long - range cross - correlation we imposed the conditions of @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( figure [ crosscorr]a ) .",
    "importantly , while in the apo structure the residue pairs under high cross - correlations are distributed only around the cytoplasmic side of the tms ( figures [ crosscorr]a , s7 ) , functionally important long - range couplings are detected between the ligand - binding and cytoplasmic g - protein binding sites in the agonist - bound form ( figures [ crosscorr]a , s7 ) .",
    "this result from the agonist - bound form is consistent with the view that a bound agonist makes tight interactions with the surrounding residues and increases the receptor activity above its basal level @xcite .",
    "the long - range coupling between the ligand binding site and g - protein binding site for the agonist - bound form is also grasped by computing the mean square fluctuation using structural ensemble ( see figure s8 ) .",
    "notably , there are multiple parallel paths linking the correlated residues @xcite , the degeneracy of which varies from 1 to as many as 480 depending on the residue pair ( for the details of entire paths between the correlated residues , see part 1 and 2 in supporting information ii ) .",
    "the presence of multiple parallel pathways is consistent with the recent new view of allostery @xcite . as some of the representative allosteric paths , linking the residues in extracellular and intracellular regions , are demonstrated in figure [ crosscorr]b , the 80 % of transmembrane signaling paths go through the residues with high c@xmath88 , which includes the microswitches as well as other functionally important residues ( see the residues represented with cyan spheres in figures [ crosscorr]b , [ crosscorr]c and part 1 , 2 in supporting information ii ) .",
    "it is these residues , lying in the midst of communication pathways , that toggle the intra - molecular signaling .",
    "the qualitatively disparate results displayed in apo and agonist - bound forms provide a picture consistent with the function of gpcrs .    to systematically group correlated residues",
    ", we carried out hierarchical clustering analysis on the acquired matrices and represented the result using dendrogram ( figure s7 ) .",
    "from the two clusters of positively correlated residues ( cluster 1 and 2 ) , the clusters of residue pairs with the strongest signal are shown on each clustered cross - correlation map of the apo and agonist - bound form with residue indices .",
    "the cross - correlated residue paris obtained using hierarchical clustering analysis ( figure s7 ) are similar to those from the simple condition of @xmath135 and @xmath134 that we imposed in figure [ crosscorr ] .",
    "the residues within each of cluster 1 and 2 are the parts of structure that  breathe together `` in terms of @xmath0 values . also , it is noteworthy that in terms of the correlation of @xmath0 value there is a strong anti - correlation between cluster 1 and cluster 2 , which suggests that ' ' breathing \" of residues in cluster 1 and cluster 2 occurs out - of - phase .",
    "lastly , it is worth considering the signaling paths on a weighted graph . to this end",
    ", we employed the  dynamical network community analysis \" @xcite , implemented to the molecular visualization package vmd . in this analysis , an inter - residue cross - correlation calculated from an ensemble of structures from long md simulation is used for the weight of edges in the network .",
    "using the networkview module in vmd and our 300 ns md simulation as an input , we calculated the optimal and a set of suboptimal paths ( offset@xmath136 ) between residue pairs that show long - range cross - correlation ( supporting information ii - part 3 ) . in most of the cases , the allosteric signaling paths computed on unweighted and weighted graphs for agonist - bound form are qualitatively similar ; yet , it is interesting to point out the large detour in the signaling paths of the residue pairs 116 - 4 and 116 - 10 on weighted graph ( see figure s5 in supporting information ii ) .",
    "deciphering the protein allostery has long been one of the grand challenges in molecular , structural , and computational biology .",
    "we elucidated allosteric hotspots and signaling pathways of the a@xmath1ar and other class a gpcrs by using the measure of betweenness centrality for each residue in protein structure network , the glycine scanning analysis , and the cross - correlation analysis based on the structural ensemble from md simulations . just like the role of native topology",
    "has been illuminated in the folding and unfolding mechanisms of proteins @xcite , the success of analysis using graph representations of protein topology underscores the importance of native protein topology as one of the most critical determinants for intramolecular allosteric signaling .",
    "it is of special note that signals generated from protein dynamics , which include changes of inter - residue force , contact , or even local packing , are transmitted via the contacts formed between two neighboring residues . from the perspective of signal transduction , the betweenness centrality , defined with the number of parallel pathways on a given node , is physically a sensible way to quantify the amount of traffic on the node , thus to identify allosteric hotspots for a given protein structure . given that residues of gpcrs associated with allostery and their signaling pathways are hard to capture using other conventional methods exploiting the information of sequence coevolution or variants of normal mode analysis ( figures [ sca ] and [ spm ] ) , the success of @xmath59-based analysis presented here is remarkable .",
    "at the current stage , not only in the context of allosteric modulations in drug design @xcite but also in the ligand binding ( or release ) induced conformational change in biological motors @xcite , the importance of allostery in understanding the protein dynamics is highlighted more than ever . from the methodological perspective of this study , our @xmath0-based network analysis on protein structures is found quite powerful in identifying allosteric hotspots , and the results of analysis are in strong correlation with biochemical studies .",
    "the list of key residues for allostery and their cross - correlation identified here should be of great help to design experiments as well as contribute to our understanding to the dynamics of gpcrs .",
