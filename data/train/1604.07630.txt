    "in convex geometric research , it is a flourishing area to examine affinely invariant problems : problems in which affine copies of a convex body are not distinguished @xcite .",
    "similarly , there are numerous results which identify only congruent copies of a convex body @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a problem dealing with convex bodies only within a given affine class , and identify all similar copies of the body .",
    "our study is also motivated by the recent , rising interest in shape evolution models in geomorphology .",
    "physical abrasion processes , composed of collisional and frictional abrasion , are of fundamental importance in the evolution of sedimentary particles .",
    "geologists try to track the shape evolution process by measuring scalar quantities called shape descriptors associated with the particle s global shape .",
    "the most common shape descriptors are the axis ratios of the approximating ellipsoid @xcite and roundness @xcite of the orthogonal projection ( sometimes also referred to as circularity @xcite ) . while substantial amount of data on shape descriptors has accumulated over decades ( e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "many aspects of the evolution of these shape descriptors in mathematical abrasion models are still not fully understood . in the mathematical theory of collisional abrasion",
    "@xcite it has always been assumed that the _ driving force _ of the evolution process is curvature , i.e. abrasion is determined not by global geometric features , rather , by local quantities .",
    "mathematical models of curvature - driven abrasion can be either continuous ( partial differential equations ) where mass is removed in continuous time @xcite or discrete ( so - called chipping models ) where finite amount of mass is removed in discrete time - steps @xcite .",
    "chipping models are , in general , not the rigorous discretizations of curvature - driven partial differential equations .",
    "frictional abrasion , on the other hand , appears to be of entirely different nature . in @xcite",
    "a set of axioms for frictional abrasion is proposed and these axioms admit geometric theories where abrasion is driven not by local quantities , rather , by global shape descriptors . not only is the experimental verification of such models still lacking , their mathematical theory has not been explored either . here",
    "we take a first step and investigate an axis - ratio - driven model which operates in discrete time , so it could be regarded as a distant relative of chipping models of curvature - driven abrasion .",
    "we start with some preliminary concepts .",

    "our main goal is the investigation of the orbits of a plane convex body @xmath0 under subsequent applications of @xmath12 .",

    "convexity does not play an important role in the results presented in this paper ; we utilized convexity when we resolved the non - uniqueness of the circumscribed rectangle .",
    "otherwise , most results remain valid for non - convex objects . in particular , the dimension @xmath331 of the phase space of the discrete dynamics defined by @xmath12 is always @xmath332 , regardless of the convexity of the investigated iterated shape . in the case of the triangle we found that there is one , global , codimension 2 ( point ) attractor in the phase space .",
    "numerical computations suggest that the attractors are always periodic orbits .",
    "one example of our computations is shown in figure [ fig : mark_trafok ] where we scanned the phase space of a ` randomly chosen ' convex heptagon .",
    "the affine copies of the heptagon are characterized , up to similarity , by two angles @xmath225 and @xmath214 of the unique maximum area triangle inscribed in it and we use these variables as the coordinates of the phase space .",
    "we note that this triangle is preserved under affine transformations of the heptagon .",
    "we started iterations on a uniform ( @xmath333 ) grid in the phase space and iterated the gridpoints 60 times .",
    "subsequently we omitted the first 10 iterates and plotted the orbits . even though the initial values are distributed uniformly over the @xmath334 plane , all their transformed copies seem to accumulate on a 5-cycle .",
    "we certainly did _ not _ find in any our computations any planar shape the discrete dynamics of which appeared to have either quasi - periodic or ergodic components .",
    "our question is related to this fact :    is it true that , regardless of the initial shape , the discrete dynamics defined by @xmath12 always has periodic attractor(s ) ?",
    "it is possible to extend our definition to higher dimensions in more than one way . for a convex body in @xmath335 , we may call a rectangular box @xmath6 circumscribed about @xmath0 with side lengths @xmath336 _ extremal _ , if @xmath337 is minimal over the family of all rectangular boxes circumscribed about @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath12 may be defined as one of the following :    * @xmath12 is the orthogonal affinity , with its hyperplane perpendicular to the sides of length @xmath338 , and ratio @xmath337 .",
    "the image of @xmath6 under this transformation is a rectangular box with side lengths @xmath339 .",
    "* @xmath12 is the composition of @xmath340 orthogonal affinities , where the hyperplane of the @xmath341th affinity is perpendicular to the sides of length @xmath342 , and its ratio is @xmath343 . the image of @xmath6 under this transformation is a cube of side length @xmath344 .    in the case of @xmath345 spatial dimensions",
    "it is easy o show that the dimension @xmath331 of the phase space will be given by @xmath346 .",
    "while from the point of view of shape evolution processes it seems interesting to find higher dimensional analogues of our model , the investigation of the above two transformations is beyond the scope of this paper .",
