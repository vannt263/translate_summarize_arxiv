    "it is a common mathematical procedure to describe light as a superposition of plane waves , which is possible and convenient thanks to the linearity of maxwell s equations and fourier analysis .",

    "a peculiarity of the tl representation is that all modes with same value of @xmath2 have the same z - projection of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",

    "self - assembled , vertical , and nanowhisker qds are fabricated using semiconductor materials , and they can confine both electrons and holes . as the name suggests ,",
    "disc - shaped qds ( dsqds ) have a stronger confinement along a given axis , and therefore the dynamics of electrons and/or holes inside the dot can be restricted to the quantized in - plane motion.@xcite in semiconductor - based qds , transitions between different electronic states can be accomplished by optical excitation .",
    "the understanding of the optical response of qds is appealing from a basic science point of view , but also because of the many possible applications , for example , to qd lasers , quantum information processing , and photodetectors . in spite of the fact that the common hermite - gaussian laser pulses are in wide use to excite qds,@xcite to the best of our knowledge",

    "[ sec_model ] the general expressions for the energy levels with magnetic field ) , leaving only one dominant transition .    for our second example we will assume that the laser can not be tuned precisely to match the energy difference between a couple of states , and that we deal with a qd of larger size , say about @xmath131 .",
    "this last assumption means that , by modifying the light - beam waist , we can choose @xmath85 on the interval @xmath132 .",
    "then , by selecting the light - beam parameter @xmath2 we instantly eliminate transitions between states differing more than @xmath2 in their z - projection of oam .",
    "furthermore , by adjusting the beam - waist , we see that we can change the probability of transition depending on the value of the radial quantum number of the electronic states ( see fig.[fig : general_cases ] ) .",
    "to fix ideas , let us imagine that the emission line of the light beam is centered around @xmath133 with width @xmath134 . under these conditions , transitions from the uppermost valence - band state to shells @xmath135 in the conduction - band are possible .",

    "thus , we conclude that even if the laser can not be precisely tuned , we still can decide which will be the dominant transitions .",
    "we have investigated the theory of optical absorption of twisted light  carrying orbital angular momentum  by disk - shaped semiconductor - based quantum dots in the presence of a static magnetic field , and calculated the dipole transition matrix element , which is the basic building block for other specific studies of optical response .    as a first general result we made explicit the selection rule for the conservation of the z - projection of the orbital angular momentum .",
