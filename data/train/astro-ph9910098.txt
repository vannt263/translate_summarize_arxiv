    "the pervading questions surrounding our current view of large - scale star formation are primarily associated with the need to understand the mechanism for triggering and globally maintaining star formation .",

    "instabilities in the ism introduced by massive star formation may play an important role in the star formation process in these systems .",

    ", the high pressures generated by stellar winds , ionized gas , and supernovae explosions can act as a triggering mechanism to convert stable configurations of gas to unstable ones .",
    "the ionization front emerging from a star formation complex is followed by a shock front generated by the supersonic flow of the ionized material .",
    "if formed on the edge of a molecular cloud , the successive passage of ionization and shock fronts into a neighboring cloud allows unstable configurations of dense neutral material to accumulate to form new stars .",
    "these stars generate new ionization fronts and the cycle continues ( blaauw 1991 ) .",
    "massive star formation has the ability to influence the formation of new sites of star formation creating linear sequences of stellar subgroups within ob associations , potentially allowing self - propagation throughout a region .",
    "the cumulative chain reactions initiated by these local events have been suggested as an overall mechanism for star formation in irregular galaxies .",
    "first proposed by gerola & seiden ( 1978 ) as a global mechanism for star formation , the stochastic self - propagating star formation model ( sspsf ) describes the propagation of star formation between neighboring regions by means of a `` percolation '' process .",
    "et  al . _ ( 1980 ) adapt the sspsf to small galaxies with no differential rotation and find the model predicts characteristics which correlate nicely with those of dwarf galaxies . in particular , the model produces galaxies that form stars in a bursting mode of short - lived episodes and a sfr that varies drastically with time . while the average sfr s are low , the galaxies have instantaneous sfr s that range from bursting to quiescent , which could explain the diverse star formation characteristics observed in dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , a recent survey of 110 virgo dwarf irregulars indicates that star formation is generally preferential to the edges , mostly to one side of the galaxy , while the sspsf model does not predict patterns that predominately favor any particular location ( brosch , heller , & almoznino 1998 ) .",

    "sequential star formation can be inferred by observations of two spatially adjacent regions with slight age differences .",
    "comparisons of h@xmath0 and fuv emission morphologies can indicate the relative ages of adjacent young star formation sites due to the longer timescale of decay of the fuv emission in a given region .",
    "the relationship between the h@xmath0 and fuv flux as a function of time for a given cluster is shown in figure 11 illustrating the physical basis for this qualitative treatment of relative cluster ages .",
    "a relatively strong fuv source surrounded by compact hii regions is suggestive of sequential star formation using this method .",
    "region 23 , shown in figure 12 , exemplifies this scenario .",
    "the region , having an average age of @xmath71 myr , consists of two compact hii regions surrounding a relatively strong fuv source .",
    "the group of regions on the western side of the central star forming arc ( regions 15 - 22 ) , shown in figure 13 , illustrates the geometry of sequential star formation as suggested by the sspsf model .",
    "age estimates of the individual regions show a mix of age groups 2@xmath114 .",
    "a chain of young star formation seen on the h@xmath0 image is located to the right of a faint chain of fuv emission suggesting star formation is propagating from left to right .",
    "massive star formation can influence new star formation activity on larger scales as high pressures from supernovae push gas away from aging ob associations . in theory , when a star forming complex has sufficient numbers of main sequence o and b stars , the combined pressures from stellar winds and supernovae are able to drive an expanding ionized shell of gas and at the same time , create a void in the neutral gas ( tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) .",
    "sequential star formation typically acts on only one side of a molecular cloud where as large - scale triggering describes the process by which a centralized source destroys the remainder of its parental molecular cloud , creating a void in the gas and a dense ridge of swept up material carried to large distances ( weaver _ et  al .",
    "_ 1977 ) . described by elmegreen ( 1992 ) as the `` collect and collapse '' method , dynamical instability of the accumulated gas collapses under self gravity to form new stars along the periphery of the shell .",
    "this scenario is a plausible explanation for the correlation between stellar age and proximity to the hi shell boundary in dwarf galaxy sextans a , where the youngest stars are primarily found in the interior of the hi shell ( van dyk , puche , & wong 1998 ) .",
    "the ridge surrounding a swept - up shell may fragment leaving chains or arcs of new star formation , allowing a means for star formation to propagate on large scales .",

    "further analysis indicates that the supernovae energy injection rate into the galaxy is sufficient to account for the global number of hi features . on the other hand , numerical simulations using hydrodynamic methods to simulate powerful local energy sources",
    "have failed to reproduce all the features in the neutral medium of hoii ( maschenko & silich 1995 ) . some of the hi holes in hoii , especially those located beyond the optical disk of the galaxy , are likely formed by alternate mechanisms such as gravitational instability via collisional dissipation of gas particles ( byrd & howard 1992 ) or infall of gas clouds ( van der hulst & sancisi 1988 ) .",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1999 ) identify a single high velocity cloud candidate in their hi data .",
    "however , the distribution of holes is too regular and present at all radii to be explained entirely by infall .",
    "other environmental factors , such as tidal perturbations , are not a factor due to the fact that hoii is fairly isolated .",
    "the closest neighbor to hoii is m81 dwarfa ( kar 52 ) . given that the kinematic hi mass of hoii is a factor of 100 greater than that of m81 dwarfa ( melisse & israel 1994 ) , it is unlikely to have affected hoii .",
    "moreover , m81 dwarfa is at a distance on the sky of roughly 27 kpc from hoii with a relative radial velocity of 44 km / s .",

    "in addition , fuv observations can show sites of secondary star formation in the dense ridges , allowing insight into the possibility that star formation triggering via giant hi shells is a viable mechanism for star formation .",

    "the lack of fuv emission in the centers of hi holes in the outer parts of hoii does not disprove the generation of large shells by massive stars since several hi voids in the inner part of the gas distribution are coincident with fuv emission .",
    "in addition , density enhancements along the rims of hi shells correspond to sites of fuv emission suggestive of propagating star formation .",
    "the largest hi hole illustrates the connection between two generations of star formation .",
    "the fuv - bright central star forming arc is aligned with the northern rim of this hi hole , while diffuse patches of fuv emission lie within its boundary .",
    "other examples of fuv emission coincident with hi voids are the eastern two patches in the northern part of the galaxy .",
    "several of the second generation sites also show they are beginning to disrupt the surrounding gas .",
    "for example , the intense star formation on the eastern edge of the central arc has hi density enhancements located on either side .",
    "tongue & westpfahl ( 1995 ) confirm the existence of supernovae inside star forming regions in this area ( regions 1 , 4 , and 6 ) using radio continuum observations .",
    "these supernovae are likely responsible in part for reshaping the surrounding neutral medium .",
    "photodisassociation of h@xmath72 on the interior of surfaces of the molecular cloud may also be responsible for the hi density enhancements surrounding the intense young star forming regions to a certain degree .",
    "however , tacconi & young ( 1987 ) do not detect any @xmath73co emission above the 3@xmath74 level in hoii .",
    "lacking other observations to trace the molecular component , its morphology remains a mystery .",
    "in general , evolved star forming knots are fairly efficient in converting in converting h@xmath75 to hi ( allen _ et  al .",

    "the age groups for individual star formation regions are displayed in figure 15 on the hi map .",
    "each of the seven regions in the oldest age group ( group 4 , @xmath76 myr ) , lies in a hi hole or local minimum in the hi density .",
    "the largest hole contains three large regions in age group 4 on the western side of its interior .",
    "the youngest regions ( group 1 , 2.5 @xmath11 3.5 myr ) are each spatially coincident with hi density enhancements suggesting the potential for new star formation is high on the dense rims of the hi holes .",
    "the majority of new star formation in the whole system is occurring on the periphery of the largest hole .",
    "the distribution of star formation ages in general can be interpreted by this comparison .",
    "the spatial proximity of a very old region and a very young one is reconciled by the hi density distribution .",

    "these comparisons suggest that massive stars do provide sufficient mechanical energy to account for the observed properties of associated hi holes in hoii .",
    "the question remains : if massive star formation can provide sufficient energy to generate holes in the surrounding neutral medium , why are there not hi holes around every ob association ?",
    "the answer may be related to global properties of the ism .",

    "solid body rotation of the gas disk is a general property of dwarf galaxies which makes them appealing for star formation studies .",
    "the lack of shear in the absence of differential rotation allows features in the hi gas to be longer - lived .",
    "the thicker gas disks and lack of shear in irregulars allow the growth of larger gas clouds ( hunter 1997 ) .",
    "this combination provides an excellent environment for stars to form in giant complexes .",

    "the radial continuity of star formation sites demonstrates that the time averaged level of activity in the past correlates with the current activity at the same radius , supporting the theory that star formation in irregular galaxies is dominated by local processes .",
