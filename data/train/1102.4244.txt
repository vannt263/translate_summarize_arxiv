    "one of the fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics are non - classical quantum states like the noon - states  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers , e.g. , to @xmath2 particles being on the left and @xmath3 particles on the right of some barrier but noon - states can also be investigated in phase - space .",

    ", we suggest to periodically shake the three - well potential .",
    "this approach to enhance tunnelling in a controlled way is based on photon - assisted tunnelling  @xcite which was realised experimentally for bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices  @xcite ( for the interpretation of the experimental data see also @xcite ) .",
    "recent research in periodically driven systems include nonlinear landau - zener processes  @xcite and transport of bound pairs  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the hamiltonian used to model the periodically shaken three - well potential as well as our main aim , the two - particle noon - states .",
    "section  [ sec : simplified ] shows that for some parameters , the quantum dynamics of the periodically shaken system can be understood within a simplified model originally developed for double wells  @xcite which we adopt for the present situation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : how ] we introduce the two - particle noon - states and explain how they can be distinguished from statistical mixtures .",
    "section  [ sec : noon ] shows that periodic shaking can considerably increase the fidelity , i.e. , the quality of the quantum superpositions . in order to show that the quantum superpositions can indeed be distinguished from statistical mixtures , last but not least decoherence effects are included",

    "a systematic sketch of the three - well potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .     the three - well potential with initially two atoms in the middle well .",
    "this situation is an experimentally realistic initial condition  @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations would , e.g. , be possible in three - well lattices  @xcite ( cf .  the double - well lattice potential with less than six atoms per lattice site of ref .",
    "periodic shaking is currently established as an experimental tool to control the quantum dynamics  @xcite . ]",
    "a fock - basis is useful to describe @xmath11 atoms in the three - well potential : @xmath12 with @xmath13 particles in the right well , @xmath3 particles in the middle well and @xmath14 particles in the left well .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to produce a single - particle quantum superposition but a two - particle noon - state : @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the fidelity , @xmath17 or more precise the fidelity maximised over all possible angles  @xmath18 is used : @xmath19 in order to be a useful flag to indicate a noon - state , the fidelity has to be larger than @xmath20 ; below this value , the state might not be a superposition at all as , e.g. , the state @xmath21 would also result in a fidelity of @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig : exactdiagonal ] displays an example for which the fidelity is well above @xmath20 .",
    "the data is plotted as a function of the dimensionless time , @xmath23 figure  [ fig : ohnetreiben ] shows that for the timescales of fig .",
    "[ fig : exactdiagonal ] and a large parameter range , even without shaking , the fidelity can reach values well above  50% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ohnetreiben ] ) but it stays again below 90% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ohnetreiben ] ) .",
    "thus , so far there does not seem to be an advantage of using periodic shaking .",
    "however , before showing that periodic shaking can lead to fidelities well above 95% , we show that it is possible to quantitatively understand the behaviour displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : exactdiagonal ] .",
    "in order to understand the behaviour under periodic shaking , a simplified version of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) can be used .",
    "this approach introduced below will be useful for large shaking frequencies and not too long timescales  @xcite .    extending the simplified model of ref .",
    "@xcite to a three - well potential starts with writing the schrdinger equation corresponding to the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) in the fock basis  ( [ eq : fock ] ) . using the short notation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fochshort ] ) , we then introduce the ansatz motivated by the interaction picture @xmath24 \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 .",
    "the tunnelling between fock states is then included in a system of first - order one - dimensional differential equations for the @xmath26 ( cf .  refs .",
    "the time - dependence enters entirely via the exponents introduced in the ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) ; it includes terms linear in time ( either proportional to the interaction or to the tilt ) as well as a term proportional to the driving amplitude for which the time - dependence is a @xmath27 .",
    "this last term can be transferred into a sum of exponentials with linear time - dependence via  @xcite @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are bessel functions .",
    "this leads to a series of relevant frequencies which for two particles read : @xmath30 the model is still equivalent to the full schrdinger equation corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) ; it now reads :    @xmath31    where @xmath32    in general , for given parameters of tilt , interaction and shaking frequencies , there will be only one term with slow time - dependence  . following the reasoning of the rotating wave approximation  @xcite ,",
    "this term should dominate the dynamics for not too large timescales . defining @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the integer for which @xmath35 reaches its minimum and repeating the same reasoning for @xmath36 and @xmath37 leads to a much simpler version of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dglsa ] ) which surprisingly can even be solved via exact diagonalisation  ) can , in general , only be solved by numerically integrating the time - dependent schrdinger equation . within this paper , we do this by using the shampine - gordon routine  @xcite ; exact diagonalisation is a much simpler approach . ]",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite where even some analytical results could be derived ) .",
    "the derivation of our simplified model explains [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : simplified ] ) ] why the two curves in fig .  [ fig : exactdiagonal ] agree well except for the deviation for larger times .",
    "the main idea is to be able to distinguish quantum superpositions from statistical mixtures via the behaviour concerning the return to the initial state .",
    "why a tilted three - well potential is useful for considerations like that can already be motivated on the single - particle level : on the one hand , despite the tilt the tunnelling processes @xmath38 do not involve any change of the potential energy . on the other hand , the individual tunnelling processes @xmath39 ) would thus be suppressed .",
    "this offers a starting point to distinguish the time - evolution of quantum superpositions from statistical mixtures : on the one hand , tunnelling of the quantum superposition @xmath40 back to the initial state @xmath41 is allowed energetically . on the other hand , for a statistical mixture like @xmath42 the tunnelling to the state @xmath41",
    "is suppressed for energetic reasons .",
    "there is , however , an even stronger reason why the return to the initial state can verify interesting quantum superpositions :    while experimentally measuring the fidelity  ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) would either be impossible or at least be a considerable challenge for future experiments , measuring the number of atoms in one of the wells is comparatively straight - forward both in an optical superlattice  @xcite and in a single three - well potential  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the two - particle noon - state @xmath43 one could experimentally verify , that with nearly 50% probability both particles are in the left well and with 50% probability both particles are in the right well . in order to distinguish this situation from the statistical mixture ,",
    "@xmath44 we will be searching for parameters such that the probability to return to the initial state is high .",
    "as the initial state is the fock state with two particles in the middle well , this is an unambiguous experimentally verifiable signature .",
    "it remains to be shown that the return to the initial state at time @xmath45  in combination with the 50/50 probability to find both particles either in the left or in the right well at time @xmath46  really is unambiguous . using the time - evolution operator @xmath47 ,",
    "one has : @xmath48 let us consider one particular ideal set of parameters for which the wave - function  @xmath49 reaches the perfect cat - state  ( [ eq : cat ] ) at @xmath50 followed by a probability to return to the initial state at @xmath51 of 100% : @xmath52 within this ideal set of parameters , an inaccurate preparation of the wave - function could lead to a return - probability of just @xmath53 : @xmath54",
    "the fact that @xmath55 implies : @xmath56 thus , for our example of a perfect return to the initial state , a fidelity of @xmath53 at @xmath50 leads to a probability of @xmath53 to return to the initial state at @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , if a noon - state has a 100% return probability to the initial state at a given time , the corresponding statistical mixture  ( [ eq : corrmix ] ) will only manage a return to the initial state with 50% probability at the same point of time   and @xmath57 . ] . while we will investigate one particular source of decoherence  particle losses  in the next section , other sources of decoherence",
    "would also lead to statistical mixtures and thus to a different dynamics .",
    "given the level at which today s experiments with ultra - cold atoms are performed , we can assume that the particles do mostly behave as predicted by the schrdinger equation without decoherence .",
    "if the return to the initial state is less than the expected 100% ( but still well above 50% ) , this does not necessarily imply that the noon - state was partially destroyed via decoherence : experimental uncertainties which would average over different solutions of the schrdinger equation could produce a similar effect .",
    "nevertheless , such a high return probability can still be a signature of the noon - state : it has to be checked if the variations of the parameters still lead to high fidelities at @xmath50 . in an experiment",
    "this would lead to probabilities of the order of 50/50 to find the two particles either in the left or in the right well .",
    "to obtain better results than displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : exactdiagonal ] and [ fig : ohnetreiben ] , three requirements were used for the numeric optimisation of the parameters :    * a fidelity well above 90% . * a high probability to return to the initial state .",
    "* not too large timescales .",
    "there are parameter - sets with and without tilt that fulfil these conditions .",
    "one example is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fidgut ] and [ fig : dekohaerenz ] .",
    "the approach via the simplified model  ( [ eq : simplified ] ) only works if more than one frequency is included in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vielefrequenzen])-([eq : vielefrequenzen2 ] ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fidgut ] ) . at first glance",
    ", the standard deviation displayed in fig .  [ fig : dekohaerenz ] might render it difficult to distinguish the behaviour including decoherence from the ideal quantum case .",
    "however , for the accuracy with which the average can be measured , the standard error is relevant which is smaller by a factor of  @xmath58 for @xmath59 measurements . taking @xmath60 this would thus reduce the error by a factor of 10 .",
    "our theory so far ignores decoherence . for the present system , atom losses via scattering with back - ground atoms",
    "are an important decoherence mechanism ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to include this into our model",
    ", we use a method called _ piecewise deterministic processes _ , pdp in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on refs  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to use quantum dynamics for the time - evolution in combination with atom losses for which the points of time of the atom losses are chosen via random numbers  @xcite .",
    "the results displayed in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig : dekohaerenz ] are averaged over many sets of random numbers .",
    "atoms are lost with a loss - rate @xmath61 ( cf .",
    "[ sec : lindblad ] ) , @xmath62 corresponding to an exponential decay of the average number of particles , which for the two particles reads : @xmath63 the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dekohaerenz ] uses @xmath64 with @xmath65 ; for the timescales of the double - well lattice experiment  @xcite , the fidelity reaches its maximum at @xmath66ms and thus @xmath67khz . in order to be able to observe the return to the initial state with 1% accuracy , we require the average number of particles  ( [ eq : nmittel ] ) to be at least 99% of the initial value up to a timescale for which pure quantum evolution predicts a nearly perfect return to the initial state ( @xmath68ms ) .",
    "this results in a lifetime of the particles of  @xmath69s .",
    "this realistic lifetime of a single particle in the lattice lies two orders of magnitude below the lifetime required to produce noon - states of , say , 100 particles according to the scheme of ref .",

    "[ fig : dekohaerenz ] shows what would happen if the quantum superposition was turned into a statistical mixture at the time for which the fidelity reaches its maximum : although now there still are two particles involved in the simulation , the average occupancy of the middle well would remain a factor of two below the values reached for pure quantum evolution .    in order to reproduce the generation of noon - states shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fidgut ] and [ fig : dekohaerenz ] , an experiment would require a control of both interaction ( @xmath70 ) and driving amplitude @xmath71 of the order of several per cent , the tilt  @xmath8 should be zero to about @xmath72 in order to reach fidelities above 0.95  . in an experiment",
