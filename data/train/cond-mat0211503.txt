    "recent biological experimental findings have indicated that synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and post - synaptic spikes .",
    "this relative timing determines whether long - term potentiation ( ltp ) or long - term depression ( ltd ) is induced @xcite .",
    "ltp occurs when presynaptic firing precedes postsynaptic firing by no more than about @xmath0 ms .",
    "in contrast , ltd occurs when presynaptic firing follows postsynaptic firing .",
    "a rapid transition between ltp and ltd takes place within a few milliseconds . a learning rule of this type",
    "is called spike - timing - dependent plasticity ( stdp ) @xcite or temporally asymmetric hebbian learning ( tah ) @xcite .",
    "the functional role of stdp has been investigated by many authors @xcite . some of these authors have claimed that the precise balance between the ltp and ltd of stdp is crucial in the storage of spatio - temporal pattterns @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we analytically showed that stdp has the same qualitative effect as the covariance rule when the balance is precisely maintained @xcite . in the brain ,",
    "though , it is inconceivable that such a balance will be precisely maintained .",
    "some authors _ numerically _ have investigated the impact of an imbalance between ltp and ltd on network properties @xcite .",
    "munro and hernandez showed that spatio - temporal patterns can not be retrieved in a noisy environment when there is no ltd @xcite .",
    "however , the _ mathematical _ mechanism that accounts for this remains unknown .    in this paper",
    ", we _ analytically _ investigate the retrieval properties of spatio - temporal patterns in an associative memory network where there is an imbalance between the ltp and ltd of stdp by using a method of the statistical neurodynamics @xcite . using this theory , we discuss the macroscopic behavior of the network at a thermodynamic limit : the number of neurons is infinite .",
    "when the balance is precisely maintained , sequential patterns can be stored in the network @xcite .",
    "also , when the mean deviation from the precise balance is @xmath1 and the fluctuation is finite , patterns can be stored at a thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this implies that when the balance is maintained on average , patterns can be stored .",
    "we also showed that when the mean is not @xmath1 , patterns can not be stored since a cross - talk noise diverges at a thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , previous work using computer simulation has shown that the stored limit cycle is stably retrieved when the number of neurons is _ finite _ @xcite . in the brain , the number of neurons is considered to be _",
    "finite_. therefore , it is important to discuss this situation , although no analytical works regarding this has been reported .",
    "the purpose of the work reported in this paper was to _ analytically _ investigate the retrieval properties when the number of neurons is finite .",
    "we found that a network containing a finite number of neurons becomes robust regarding this deviation from a precise balance between the ltp and ltd of stdp .",
    "since the number of neurons in the brain is considered to be finite , our results might apply to the brain .",
    "we introduce our model for the storage of spatio - temporal patterns in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we analytically discuss our model as it applies when the balance between the ltp and ltd of stdp is precisely maintained and when it is not precisely maintained , and in section 4 we investigate the properties of our model . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize this paper .",
    "the appendix presents a detailed derivation of the model s dynamical equations of the model when the balance is precisely maintained .",
    "the model contains @xmath2 binary neurons with reciprocal connections .",
    "each neuron takes a binary value : @xmath3 .",
    "we define discrete time steps and the following rule for synchronous updating : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the state of the @xmath6-th neuron at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the internal potential of that neuron , and @xmath9 is a uniform threshold . if the @xmath6-th neuron fires at @xmath7 , its state is @xmath10 ; otherwise , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the synaptic weight from the @xmath13-th neuron to the @xmath6-th neuron .",
    "each element @xmath14 of the @xmath15-th memory pattern @xmath16 is generated independently by @xmath17 = 1 - \\mbox{prob}[\\xi^{\\mu}_i = 0 ] = f. \\label{eq.pattern}\\ ] ] the expectation of @xmath18 is @xmath19 = f$ ] ; thus , @xmath20 is considered to be the mean firing rate of the memory pattern . the memory pattern is sparse when @xmath21 , and this coding scheme is called sparse coding .    the synaptic weight @xmath12 follows the form of synaptic plasticity , which depends on the difference in spike times between the @xmath6-th ( post- ) and @xmath13-th ( pre- ) neurons .",
    "this difference determines whether ltp or ltd is induced .",
    "such a learning rule is called spike - timing - dependent plasticity ( stdp ) .",
    "biological experimental findings have shown that ltp or ltd is induced when the difference between the pre- and post - synaptic spike times falls within about @xmath0 ms @xcite ( figure [ fig.asymmetric](a ) ) .",
    "there are also other types of stdp @xcite .",
    "the stdp type of figure [ fig.asymmetric](a ) has often been used in theoretical work ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we transformed this type of window function into the time window shown in figure [ fig.asymmetric](b ) .",
    "this time window shows that ltp is induced when the @xmath13-th neuron fires one time step before the @xmath6-th neuron fires , i.e. , @xmath22 , while ltd is induced when the @xmath13-th neuron fires one time step after the @xmath6-th neuron fires , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "we define a single time step in equations ( [ eq.dynamics1][eq.dynamics3 ] ) as @xmath0 ms , and any duration of less than @xmath0 ms is ignored .",
    "a synaptic plasticity obeying this time window is described by @xmath24 after memory patterns are embedded by stdp , the synaptic weight is written as @xmath25 where the value @xmath26 is a scaling factor and the number of memory patterns is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is defined as the loading rate . if both the @xmath6-th neuron and the @xmath13-th neuron fire simultaneously , neither ltp nor ltd occurs because equation ( [ eq.learning ] ) does not include the term of @xmath29 . since the relative ltp and ltd magnitudes are more critical than the absolute magnitudes , the ltd magnitude changes while the ltp magnitude and the time duration are fixed .",
    "@xmath30 denotes deviation from a precise balance . when @xmath31 , the balance is precisely maintained and this model is equivalent to the previous one @xcite .",
    "a sequence of @xmath32 memory patterns is stored by stdp : @xmath33 . in other words , @xmath34 is retrieved at @xmath35 , @xmath36 is retrieved at @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is retrieved at @xmath39 .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath40 of the loading rate , so that a loading rate higher than @xmath40 causes retrieval of the pattern sequence to become unstable .",
    "@xmath40 is therefore called the storage capacity .",
    "here , we briefly discuss the case where the balance is precisely maintained , which we previously discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "this discussion will help explain the case where the balance is not precisely maintained .",
    "first , we consider a simple situation where there are very few memory patterns relative to the number of neurons ; i.e. , @xmath41 . let the state at time @xmath7 be equivalent to the @xmath7-th memory pattern : @xmath42 .",
    "the internal potential @xmath8 of equation ( [ eq.dynamics1 ] ) is then given by @xmath43 @xmath8 depends on two independent random variables , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the first term @xmath44 is the signal term for the recall of the pattern @xmath46 , which is intended to be retrieved at time @xmath47 , and the second term @xmath45 may interfere with the retrieval of @xmath46 . according to equation ( [ eq.u ] ) , @xmath8 takes a value of @xmath1 , @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath8 is given by figure [ fig.uprob](a ) ; i.e. , @xmath50 if the threshold @xmath9 is set between @xmath1 and @xmath49 , the probability of @xmath51 is @xmath52 , that of @xmath53 is @xmath54 , and that of @xmath55 is @xmath54 .",
    "the overlap between the state @xmath56 and the memory pattern @xmath46 is given by @xmath57 at a sparse limit , the overlap @xmath58 approaches @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the memory pattern @xmath46 is retrievable .",
    "next , we consider the case where there is a large number of memory patterns , i.e. , @xmath60 . the @xmath6-th neuronal internal potential @xmath8 at time @xmath7 is given using the periodic boundary condition of @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath63 the first term in equation ( [ eq.u1 ] ) is the signal term for the recall of pattern @xmath46 .",
    "the second term is the cross - talk noise term that represents the contributions of non - target patterns other than @xmath64 , and prevents the retrieval of the target pattern @xmath46 .",
    "the cross - talk noise is assumed to obey a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath1 and time - dependent variance @xmath65 .",
    "we derive the recursive equation for the overlap @xmath66 between the state @xmath67 and the target pattern @xmath68 by using the method of the statistical neurodynamics @xcite to calculate the overlap @xmath66 .",
    "the recursive equation is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 include @xmath74 , @xmath66 depends on @xmath75 .",
    "the recursive equation for @xmath75 is @xmath76 the recursive equations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the details of this derivation are given in the appendix . to obtain the storage capacity @xmath40",
    ", we calculate the overlap in the steady state .",
    "we set the initial state of the network at the first memory pattern : @xmath84 . setting the initial values at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 and using the recursive equations ( 13 - 16 )",
    ", we obtain the overlap in the steady state .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath40 of the loading rate , so that the loading rate higher than @xmath40 causes retrieval of the pattern sequence to become unstable . in computer simulation ,",
    "when the overlap in the steady state is smaller than @xmath89 , the critical loading rate is regarded as the storage capacity @xmath40 .",
    "the case where balance is not precisely maintained is difficult to treat because the mean of the cross - talk noise is not @xmath1 .",
    "however , previous work using computer simulations has shown that the stored limit cycle is stably retrieved when the number of neurons is finite @xcite . however",
    ", this mathematical mechanism has remained unknown . to investigate this unknown mechanism",
    ", we will use the theory derived in section [ sec.previous ] .",
    "first , let the state at time @xmath7 be equivalent to the @xmath7-th memory pattern : @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath6-th neuronal internal potential @xmath8 at time @xmath7 is then given using the periodic boundary condition of @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "here , we evaluate the second term ; that is , the compensation term in equation ( [ eq.epsilonu ] ) .",
    "the average of this term is @xmath92 where @xmath93 when @xmath42 .",
    "a typical value of this term is @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which are typical values used in the following analysis .",
    "this value is small enough for the overlap @xmath99 .",
    "the fluctuation in the compensation term can be eliminated since the order of the variance of this term is smaller than that of the average .",
    "therefore , the average term of the compensation term adds to the signal term in equation ( [ eq.u1 ] ) .",
    "next , we will discuss a mechanism that enables memory patterns to be retrieved in the small @xmath30 and finite @xmath2 case .",
    "the internal potential with @xmath42 is given by @xmath100 when @xmath101 , each distribution of @xmath8 shifts by @xmath102 as shown in figure [ fig.uprob](b ) .",
    "for the typical case at @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath103 , each distribution of @xmath8 would shift left by @xmath94 . since the threshold is @xmath104 , the probability of @xmath105",
    "is little changed . in other words , for the small @xmath30 and finite @xmath2 case , retrieval of the next pattern @xmath46 is successful .",
    "otherwise , the retrieval fails .",
    "since the average term of the compensation term adds to the signal term in equation ( [ eq.u1 ] ) , the @xmath6-th neuronal internal potential @xmath8 at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath106 here , the first term is the signal term and the second is the cross - talk noise term .",
    "the third term is the compensation term .",
    "statistical neurodynamics enables us to derive dynamical equations .",
    "these equations are almost the same as those in section [ sec.previous ] other than @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,",
    "@xmath9 is replaced by @xmath107 .",
    "we used statistical neurodynamics and computer simulation to investigate the properties of our model and examine its behavior .",
    "figure [ fig.alpha ] shows the dependence of the overlap @xmath66 on the loading rate @xmath28 when the mean firing rate of the memory pattern is @xmath98 and the threshold ( optimized to maximize the storage capacity ) is @xmath103 .",
