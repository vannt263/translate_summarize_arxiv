    "at the beginning of book iii of the principia  @xcite newton introduced four ` rules of reasoning in philosophy ' .",
    "the first of them was :    we are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearences .",
    "it is still a salutary exercise to apply this simple principle to any domain of science .",
    "what are fundamental and truly important in the scientific description of phenomena are those concepts that can not be discarded without destroying the predictive power of the theory .",
    "the most powerful , the best , scientific theory is that which describes the widest possible range of natural phenomena in terms of the minimum number of essential ( i.e. non - discardable ) concepts .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to apply this precept of newton to classical electromagnetism ( cem ) .",
    "the relation of cem to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , in the attempt to obtain a deeper physical understanding of the former , will also be discussed .    from the work of coulomb , ampre and faraday on , the basic phenomena of cem ,",
    "i.e. what are actually observed in experiments , are the forces between electric charges at rest or in motion , or the dynamical consequences of such forces .",
    "the force between two static charges is given by coulomb s inverse square law .",
    "this law will taken as a postulate in the following , but no other dynamical concept or theoretical construction will be introduced as an independent hypothesis in order to build up the theory .",
    "later , it will be seen that , in qed , this law is a necessary consequence of the existence of , and exchange of , space - like virtual photons between the electric charges .",
    "it will be assumed throughout that the system of interacting electric charges is a conservative one , in classical mechanics , and so may be described by a lagrangian that is a function of the coordinates and velocities of the charges , but does not depend explicitly on the time . calculating the action from the lagrangian of the system and applying hamilton s principle that the action be an extremum with respect to variation of the space - time trajectories of the charges , yields , in the well - known manner , the lagrange equations that provide a complete dynamical description of the system  @xcite .",
    "it is further required that the physical description be consistent with special relativity . for this",
    ", the lagrangian must be a lorentz scalar . to introduce the method to be used to construct the lagrangian , which is likely to be familiar only to particle physicists , i quote a passage taken from some lecture notes by r.hagedorn  @xcite on relativistic kinematics dating from some four decades ago :",
    "if a question is of such a nature that its answer will be always the same , no matter in which lorentz system one starts , then it is possible to formulate the answer entirely with the help of those invariants which one can build with the available four vectors .",
    "one then finds the answer in a particular lorentz system which one can choose freely and in such a way that the answer there is obvious and most easy .",
    "one looks then how the invariants appear in this particular system , expresses the answer to the problem by these invariants and one has found at the same time aleady the general answer ... it is worthwhile to devote some thinking to this method of calculation until one has completely understood that there is really no jugglery or guesswork in it and that it is absolutely safe .",
    "it is important to stress the last sentence in this passage in relation to the word ` true ' in newton s philosophical precept quoted above .",
    "just the method outlined above was used to derive the bargmann - michel - telegdi ( bmt ) equation for spin motion in arbitary magnetic and electric fields  @xcite",
    ".    it will be demonstrated in the following that it is sufficient to apply hagedorn s programme to the simplest possible non - trivial electrodynamical system that may be considered : two mutually interacting electric charges , in order to derive all the mechanical equations of cem , as well as maxwell s equations , with coulomb s inverse square law as the only dynamical hypothesis .",
    "the mechanical equations comprise the relativistic generalisation of the biot and savart law , the lorentz force equation and those describing electromagnetic induction effects with uniformly moving source currents and test charges     an aspect that is not touched upon in the above programme is radiation . in this case",
    "a fundamental classical description of the phenomenon , in the sense of newton s precept , is not possible and quantum mechanics must be invoked . in the language of qed , the existence of real photons as well as the virtual photons responsible for the coulomb force , must be admitted .",
    "indeed , extra degrees of freedom must be added to the lagrangian to describe the propagation of real photons and their interaction with electric charges .",
    "also the corresponding potentials and fields are retarded , not instantaneous .",
    "a brief comment is made in the concluding section on the relation of maxwell s equations to radiation phenomena ; however , no detailed comparison with qed is attempted .",
    "it is also assumed throughout the paper that the effects of gravitation , that is of the curvature of space - time , on the interaction between the charged physical objects considered , may be neglected .",
    "two physical objects o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 of masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 and electric charges @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , are assumed to be in spatial proximity , far from all other electric charges , so that they interact electromagnetically , but are subjected to no external forces .",
    "the spatial positions of o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 are specified , relative to their common center of energy , by the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the spatial distance separating the two objects in their common center - of - mass ( cm ) frame : @xmath8 is given by the modulus of the vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 where : @xmath11    the non - relativistic ( nr ) lagrangian describing the motion of the objects o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 in their overall cm frame is  @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) are the kinetic energies and velocities , respectively of o@xmath0 ( o@xmath1 ) and @xmath17 is the potential energy of the system . a lorentz - invariant lagrangian describing the system o@xmath0 , o@xmath1 will now be constructed in such a way that it reduces to eqn(2.2 ) in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the lagrangian must be a lorentz scalar constructed from the 4-vectors .",
    "therefore the dependence of the lagrangian on the independent 4-vector @xmath18 may be neglected . ] : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 that completely specify the spatial and kinematical configuration of the interacting system . here",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 and the ` 4-vector velocity ' , @xmath24 , is defined as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the proper time of the object , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in general , the lagrangian may depend on the following six lorentz invariants , constructed from the relevant 4-vectors : @xmath29 so that the lagrangian may be written as : @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31-@xmath32 are lorentz - scalars that may also be , in general , arbitary functions of the six lorentz invariants listed above . taking the nr limit : @xmath33 gives vanishes in the nr limit where terms of o ( @xmath34 ) are neglected : @xmath35 . ] : @xmath36 where a time - like metric is chosen for 4-vector products .",
    "note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined at the same time , @xmath39 , in the cm frame of o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 , so that @xmath40 in the 4-vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ". thus the coulomb interaction is assumed to be instantaneous in the cm frame . as discussed in section 6 below ,",
    "such behaviour is a prediction of qed .",
    "consistency between eqns(2.2 ) and ( 2.5 ) requires that be identified with the potential energy term in ( 2.2 ) . ] : @xmath43 the choice @xmath44 satisfies the last condition in ( 2.6 ) and yields for the lorentz - scalar lagrangian : @xmath45 where the current 4-vectors : @xmath46 and @xmath47 have been introduced .",
    "this lagrangian may be written in a manifestly lorentz - invariant manner by noting that : @xmath48 so that @xmath49 and @xmath50 the lagrangian ( 2.7 ) , when substituted into the covariant lagrange equations derived from hamilton s principle  @xcite : @xmath51 is shown in the following sections to enable all the concepts and equations of cem concerning inter - charge forces , in the absence of radiation , to be derived without introducing any further postulate .",
    "note that , since the lagrangian ( 2.7 ) is a lorentz scalar , it provides a description of the motion of o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 in any inertial reference frame .",
    "considering only the motion of o@xmath0 , introducing the ` 4-vector potential ' , @xmath52 , according to the definition : @xmath53 the well - known  @xcite lorentz - invariant lagrangian describing the motion of the object o@xmath0 in the ` electromagnetic field created by the object o@xmath1 ' : @xmath54 is recovered . in the same way",
    ", the motion of o@xmath1 in the ` electromagnetic field created by the object o@xmath0 ' is given by the invariant lagrangian : @xmath55 where : @xmath56 to now introduce the concepts of distinct ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' fields it is sufficient to consider only the motion of o@xmath0 . to simplify the equations",
    "the labels ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' will be dropped in eqn(3.2 ) and the following notation is used for spatial partial derivatives : @xmath57 the lagrangian ( 3.2 ) is now introduced into the lagrange equations ( 2.9 ) .",
    "considering the 1 spatial components of the 4-vectors , the first term on the lhs of eqn(2.9 ) is : @xmath58 and the second is : @xmath59 combining eqns(2.9 ) , ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7)and transposing : @xmath60\\ ] ] where the ` energy - momentum 4-vector ' @xmath61 has been introduced . substituting the euler formula for the total time derivative in the first term on the right side of ( 3.9 ) arises from the instantaneous motion of the ` source ' o@xmath1 , whereas the remaining terms describe the variation of @xmath62 due to the motion of o@xmath0 . ] : @xmath63 into ( 3.8 ) , writing out explicitly the 4-vector product @xmath64 , and cancelling a common factor @xmath65 from each term , gives : @xmath66\\ ] ] introducing now 3-vector ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' fields , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , according to the definitions : @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the alternating tensor equal to @xmath72 when @xmath73 is an even ( odd ) permutation of 123 , and zero otherwise , enables eqn(3.10 ) to be written as the compact expression : @xmath74\\ ] ] which is the 1 component of the lorentz force equation .",
    "the 2 and 3 components are derived by cyclic permutations of the indices 1,2,3 in eqn(3.10 ) , yielding finally the 3-vector lorentz force equation : @xmath75\\ ] ] the concepts of ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' fields have therefore appeared naturally as a means to simplify the lorentz force equation ( 3.10 ) . however , the rhs of this equation is completely defined , via eqn(3.1 ) , by the 4-vector current @xmath76 , the spatial separation @xmath77 of o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 and the 3-velocity of o@xmath0 , so that the 4-vector potential @xmath78 may be eliminated from the lorentz force equation . substituting the definition of @xmath78 from eqn(3.1 ) into eqns(3.11 ) and ( 3.12 ) , and restoring the labels of quantities associated with o@xmath1 , gives but not @xmath38 is held constant .",

    "eqn(3.16 ) is the relativistic generalisation of the biot and savart law .",
    "it differs from the usual cem formula by a factor @xmath83 .",
    "note that the electric field is , in general , non - radial .",
    "the non - radial part of the field , associated with the last term on the right side of ( 3.15 ) , originates in the second term on the right side of ( 3.11 ) .",
    "this is the electric field that is associated with the time variation of the magnetic field in the faraday - lenz law . for the case of a source charge in uniform motion in the @xmath84-direction , with velocity @xmath16 , the electric and magnetic fields given by ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.16 ) at the field point @xmath85 are : @xmath86 \\\\   \\vec{b } & = & \\frac{\\vec{v}_2 \\times \\vec{e}}{c }        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are unit vectors in the @xmath84- and @xmath89-directions .",
    "these equations may be compared with the pre - relativistic heaviside  @xcite formulae for this case : @xmath90 the fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 are also the ` present time ' fields as derived  @xcite from the retarded linard - wiechert potentials  @xcite . by considering a simple two - charge ` magnet ' , in a particular spatial configuration , either in motion or at rest , it has been shown  @xcite that the radial electric field of ( 3.19 ) predicts a vanishing induction effect for a moving magnet and stationary test charge .",
    "in the same configuration ( 3.17 ) predicts the same induction force on the test charge as the faraday - lenz law .",
    "the heaviside formulae are therefore valid only to first order in @xmath93 , in which case the predictions of ( 3.19 ) and ( 3.20 ) are the same as those of ( 3.17 ) and ( 3.18 ) .",

    "the lagrangian ( 2.7 ) is readily generalised to describe the mutual electromagnetic interactions of an arbitary number of charged objects : @xmath112 here @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 specify the positions of o@xmath116 and o@xmath117 , respectively , relative to the centre - of - energy on the @xmath118 interacting objects .",

    "the lagrangian describing the motion of the object @xmath120 ` in the electromagnetic field of ' the remaining @xmath121 objects may be derived from eqn(3.33 ) : @xmath122 where @xmath123 this equation embodies the classical superposition principle for the electromagnetic 4-vector potential , and hence , via the linear equations ( 3.11 ) and ( 3.12 ) , that for the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "writing out explicitly the spatial components of the quantity @xmath124 using the definition of @xmath125 , eqn(3.12 ) : @xmath126 it follows , since @xmath127 that , on summing eqns(4.1 ) , ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) , @xmath128 which is the magnetostatic maxwell equation . since @xmath129 , ( 4.4 ) can also be seen to follow from the 3-vector identity @xmath130 for arbitary @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "subsituting the 3-vector form of eqn(3.12 ) in the second term on the rhs of eqn(4.5 ) then yields the faraday - lenz law : @xmath137    the electrostatic maxwell equation : @xmath138 is a well - known consequence of the inverse square law for a ` static ' electric field defined by only the first term on the rhs of eqn(3.11 ) and gauss theorem  @xcite .",
    "the 4-vector current density : @xmath139 , the 0 component of which appears in eqn(4.7 ) , is related to the currents , @xmath140 , of elementary charges @xmath141 by the relation : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the volume of a spatial region @xmath144 .",
    "hence @xmath145 is , in the non - relativistic limit where @xmath146 , the average spatial density of electric charge in the region @xmath144 .",

    "since @xmath151 is a lorentz invariant this quantity then vanishes in all inertial refererence frames . taking the scalar product of @xmath152 and @xmath153",
    "gives : @xmath154 which is just the continuity equation ( 4.9 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the conservation of electric charge is a consequence of its lorentz - scalar nature , i.e. the charge @xmath141 in eqn(4.10 ) does not depend on the frame in which @xmath155 is evaluated .",
    "indeed , the definition @xmath156 implies that @xmath157 , so that @xmath158 is manifestly lorentz invariant , in precise analogy with the mass of an object : @xmath159 .",
    "both @xmath140 and @xmath160 are proportional to the 4-vector velocity @xmath161 .",
    "a relation similar to ( 4.9 ) is : @xmath162 the so - called ` lorenz condition ' , which may also be written more simply as @xmath163 .",
    "this relation is , in the present approach , not , as in conventional discussions of cem , the result of a particular choice of gauge in the definition of @xmath164 , but an identity following from the definition of @xmath78 in eqn(3.1 ) .",
    "in fact as is easily shown : @xmath165 here the derivatives in @xmath133 are with respect to the ` field point ' @xmath37 in contrast with those in @xmath133 in eqns(4.9)-(4.11 ) , which are with respect to the spatial coordinate @xmath38 of the object o@xmath1 associated with the current @xmath166 .",
    "the partial time derivative in ( 4.12 ) is defined for @xmath37 constant .",
    "the time variation of @xmath167 is then due solely to the time dependence of @xmath38 , which leads to the second member of ( 4.13 ) .",
    "eqn(4.12 ) shows that the 4-vector potential , like the current and energy - momentum 4-vectors corresponds to a conserved ( lorentz invariant ) quantity : @xmath168 .",

    "this point will be briefly discussed in section 7 .",
    "the electrodynamic maxwell equation ( ampre s law , including maxwell s ` displacement current ' ) is derived immediately on writing the electrostatic maxwell equation ( 4.7 ) in a covariant form .",
    "the latter then appears as an equation for the 0 component of a 4-vector .",
    "the corresponding spatial components , written down simply by inspection , are ampre s law . writing eqn(4.7 ) in 4-vector notation , and introducing also the ` non - static ' component of the electric field , given by the second term on the rhs of eqn(3.11 ) , gives : @xmath173 adding to eqn(4.15 ) the identity : @xmath174 gives : @xmath175 since the coefficients of @xmath167 and @xmath176 are lorentz scalars , the corresponding @xmath120th spatial component of the 4-vector @xmath153 , is from the manifest covariance of eqn(4.16 ) , given by the equation : @xmath177 this is ampre s law in 4-vector notation . in order to recover the more familiar 3-vector equation ,",
    "the 4-vector potential must be eliminated in favour of the electric and magnetic fields defined in eqns(3.11 ) and ( 3.12 ) respectively . to do this , consider the contribution of the spatial parts ( sp ) of the 4-vector products on the lhs of eqn(4.17 ) to @xmath178 .",

    "this derivation of ampre s law , starting from the electrostatic maxwell equation , ( 4.7 ) has been previously given by schwartz  @xcite , and , independently , by the present author in reference  @xcite , where it was noted that eqn(4.17 ) may be derived from eqn(4.16 ) using space - time exchange symmetry invariance .",
    "equations ( 3.21),(3.22),(3.31 ) and ( 3.32 ) show that the dynamics of any system of mutually interacting electrically charged objects is completely specified by their masses , electric charges and 4-vector positions and velocities .",
    "other useful and important concepts of cem such as the 4-vector potential and electric and magnetic fields are completely specified , in terms of the geometrical and kinematical configuration of the charged objects by eqn(3.1 ) for @xmath182 , eqns(3.1 ) and ( 3.11 ) for @xmath110 and eqns(3.1 ) and ( 3.12 ) for @xmath125 .",

    "the 4-vector potential is at a first level of abstraction .",
    "the phenomenologically most useful concepts of cem , the electric and magnetic fields are , in turn , completely specified by @xmath182 and so are at a second level of abstraction from the fundamental and irreducible concepts ( charged , interacting , physical objects ) of the theory .    indeed , there is yet a third level of abstraction , the tensor @xmath183 of the electromagnetic field defined as : @xmath184 this description was introduced by einstein in his original paper on general relativity  @xcite in analogy with the tensor @xmath185 of the classical gravitational field .",

    "as shown above , coulomb s law and special relativity , given , of course , the _ a priori _ existence of charged physical objects , do provide such a fundamental description , in which the ` fields ' of electromagnetism appear naturally by mathematical substitution .",
    "if all that was known of cem was eqn(5.2 ) , it is hard to see any logical path to derive from it the lorentz force , biot and savart and faraday - lenz laws that actually describe the results of laboratory experiments in cem .",
    "however these laws , eqn(5.2 ) and the magnetostatic maxwell equation ( 4.4 ) are all necessary consequences of coulomb s law , special relativity and hamilton s principle . the higher the level of mathematical abstraction , the more elegant the electrodynamic formulae appear to be , but the further removed they become from the physical realities of the subject .",
    "although einstein spent some decades of his life in the unsuccessful attempt to realise a unifying synthesis between the classical field tensors @xmath183 and @xmath185 he still made a clear distinction between physical reality and mathematical abstraction@xcite :    we have seen , indeed , that in a more complete analysis the energy tensorcan be regarded only as a provisional means of representing matter . in reality , matter consists of electrically charged particles , and is to be regarded itself as a part , in fact the principle part , of the electromagnetic field .",
    "in fact , electrically charged particles and real and virtual photons ( which are also particles ) are the true irreducible concepts of cem .",
    "these are not the ` principle part ' of the electromagnetic field , but rather _ replace it _ in the most fundamental description of the phenomena of cem .",
    "since the only dynamical postulate in cem is coulomb s law , the only way to obtain a deeper physical understanding is by a deeper understanding of this law . indeed , as will be discussed in the following section , this does seem to be possible by considering the particle aspects of the microscopic underlying qed process , which is basically mller scattering : @xmath194 .",
    "if the electrodynamical force is transmitted by particle exchange , and it is assumed that the magnitude of the force is proportional to the number of interacting particles , which are emitted isotropically by the source , the inverse square law follows from spatial geometry and conservation of the number of particles force law was predicted  @xcite .",
    "also , as a consequence of kepler s aristotelian understanding of dynamics , the force was conjectured to sweep the planets around the sun in the transverse direction , rather than diverting them radially from their natural rectilinear motion , as in newtonian dynamics . ] .",
    "however , in the coulomb interaction the exchanged particle is a virtual , not a real , photon .",
    "this means that it can not always be considered to move in a particular direction in space - time .",
    "it will be shown below , however , that the fourier transform of the momentum - space virtual photon propagator does yield a space - time propagator with the @xmath195 dependence of the coulomb potential , which corresponds , in the classical limit , to an inverse square force law .",
    "it is also shown that , in the cm frame of the interacting charged particles , this interaction is instantaneous , as assumed in the derivation of the classical lagrangian ( 2.7 ) .    according to qed ,",
    "the biot and savart and lorentz force laws are the classical limit of mller scattering for very large numbers of electrons at very large spatial separations .",
    "conversely , mller scattering is the quantum limit of the biot and savart and lorentz force laws when each current contains a single electron and the spatial separation of the currents is very small .",
    "the fundamental quantum mechanical laws governing mller scattering do not change when many electrons , with macroscopic spatial separations , participate in the observed physical phenomenon . a more fundamental understanding of cem",
    "is therefore provided , not by any kind of field concept , but by properly taking into account the existence of virtual photons , just as an analysis in terms of real photon production is mandatory for a fundamental description of the radiative processes of cem , a subject beyond the scope of the present paper .    the invariant qed amplitude for mller scattering by the exchange of a single virtual photon .",
    "the contribution of the second amplitude is negligible in this limit . ]",
    "is given by the expression  @xcite : are assumed . ]",
    "@xmath196 the corresponding feynman and momentum - space diagrams are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the virtual photon is exchanged between the 4-vector currents @xmath197 and @xmath198 defined in terms of plane - wave solutions , @xmath161 ,  @xmath199 of the dirac equation : @xmath200\\ ] ] where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the energy - momentum 4-vectors of the incoming and scattered electron , respectively , that emit a virtual photon at the space - time point @xmath203 and @xmath204 is the electron charge .",
    "the overall centre - of - mass frame ( fig1b ) is a breit frame for the virtual photon , i.e. the latter has vanishing energy : @xmath205 thus , in this frame , the invariant amplitude may be written : @xmath206 as shown in the appendix , use of the fourier transform : @xmath207 enables the invariant amplitude to be written as the space - time integral : @xmath208 it can be seen that the integrand in eqn(6.6 ) has exactly the same @xmath209 structure as the potential energy term in the invariant cem lagrangian ( 2.7 ) .",
    "indeed this is to be expected in the feynman path integral ( fpi ) formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of eqn(6.6 ) is that the total amplitude is given by integration over all spatial positions : @xmath210 , @xmath211 at time @xmath212 , and all times @xmath212 , of emission and absorption of a single virtual photon of eqn(6.1 ) is equivalent , in space - time , to the exchange of an infinity of virtual photons emitted and absorbed at different spatial positions and times .",
    "all these virtual photons however have , according to eqn(6.6 ) , infinite velocity . ] in the scattering process : @xmath194 .",
    "since the virtual photon is not observed , this is just a manifestation of quantum mechanial superposition : a sum of different probability amplitudes with the same initial and final states .",
    "notice that the virtual photon propagates with infinite velocity between the spatial positions @xmath213 , @xmath214 so that the ambiguity in the direction of propagation of the space - like virtual photon ( see fig.1b and c ) has no relevance .",
    "thus qed predicts that virtual photons produce instantaneous ` action at a distance ' in the overall centre - of - mass frame of mller scattering .",
    "this is also implicit in the discussion of cem in sections 2 and 3 above , since all forces are defined at a fixed time in the cm frame of the interacting charges .",
    "the meaning of the retarded linard - wiechert  @xcite potentials and ` causality ' in relation to the instantaneous forces transmitted by space - like virtual photons is discussed in the concluding section of this paper .",
    "to examine more closely the connection between eqn(6.6 ) and the fpi formalism , consider the general fpi expression for a transition amplitude  @xcite : @xmath215 where the action , @xmath216 , is given by the time integral of the _ classical _ lagrangian , @xmath217 , of the quantum system under consideration : @xmath218 ( here the upper dot denotes time differentiation ) and @xmath219 where @xmath220,@xmath41 , ... denote sucessive positions along the path , each separated by a small , fixed , time interval @xmath221 .",
    "also @xmath222 .",
    "@xmath78 is a normalistation constant that depends upon @xmath221 . in the case of present interest , mller scattering , the one dimensional fpi ( 6.7 ) , with a single particle ,",
    "is generalised to three spatial dimensions and two particles with the label @xmath223 , @xmath224 , corresponding to the two electrons which scatter from each other ( see fig.1 ) . in this case ,",
    "( 6.7 ) is generalised to  @xcite : @xmath225 and ( 6.8 ) to @xmath226 where @xmath120 and @xmath227 are the initial and final states of the mller scattering process .",
    "assuming that the transition @xmath228 is caused by a small term @xmath229 in the action where @xmath230 and @xmath231 , enables ( 6.10 ) to be written as : @xmath232 in the last line the formal differentials @xmath233 for arbitary space - time paths @xmath234 are replaced by those corresponding to the electrons a and b in the mller scattering process that , in the classical limit , propagate along straight - line paths so that correspond to different values of @xmath170 in eqn(6.9 ) , for a given value of @xmath235 . in the case of a straight line path",
    "the value of the limit in ( 6.9 ) is independent of the value of @xmath221 . in particular",
    ", the choice @xmath236 is possible .",
    "this yields eqn(6.13 ) . ] : @xmath237 where the normalisation constant in ( 6.9 ) has been dropped , since only the proportionality of the matrix elements ( 6.6 ) and ( 6.12 ) is under investigation .",
    "comparison of eqns(6.6 ) and ( 6.12 ) gives : @xmath238 in order to compare eqn(6.14 ) with the potential energy term in eqn(2.7 ) which has the same 4-vector structure as eqn(6.14 ) , the classical limit of the qed transition currents @xmath197 and @xmath198 , where the momentum carried by the virtual photon vanishes , must be considered .",
    "for this it is convenient to use the gordon identity  @xcite for the spinor product appearing in eqn(6.2 ) : @xmath239 u_i\\ ] ] where @xmath240 in the overall centre - of - mass frame in the limit of vanishing virtual photon momentum : @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this classical limit eqn(6.2 ) gives : @xmath244 where @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , up to a multiplicative constant , the classical limit of the qed transition current @xmath246 is identical to the cem current @xmath247 introduced in section 2 above , and also , up to a constant multiplicative factor , the classical limit of the matrix element of the qed interaction lagrangian @xmath248 is equal to the potential energy term in the cem lagrangian ( 2.7 ) .",
    "there is thus a seamless transition from qed to cem .",
    "hamilton s principle of classical mechanics is the @xmath249 limit of feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "so it may be said that the third postulate in the derivation , from first principles , of cem presented in this paper is not really an independent premise , but rather a prediction of quantum mechanics . to show this , it is necessary to consider the behaviour of the fundamental fpi formula ( 6.7 ) for a transition amplitude in the classical limit .",
    "the action s in this formula is a functional of the different space - time paths @xmath250 .",
    "writing explicitly the dependence on planck s constant , gives a multiplicative factor @xmath251/\\hbar)$ ] in the transition amplitude .",
    "if the paths @xmath250 are chosen such that the variation of @xmath216 is large in comparison to @xmath252 , this factor will exhibit rapid phase oscillations and give a negligible contribution to the transition amplitude . if , however , the paths are chosen in such a way that @xmath216 is near to an extremum with respect to their variation , @xmath216 will change only very slowly from path to path , so that the contributions of different paths have have almost the same phase , resulting in a large contribution to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the classical limit corresponds to @xmath253 , where only the path giving the extremum of @xmath216 contributes .",
    "this path is just the classical trajectory as defined by hamilton s principle .",
    "this argument , that may be called the ` stationary phase principle ' , was first given by dirac in 1934  @xcite(see also reference  @xcite ) and was an important motivation for feynman s space - time reformulation of the principles of quantum mechanics  @xcite .    at this point",
    "it can be truthfully said that there is ` nothing left to explain ' for an understanding of the fundamental physics of cem , given the laws of special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the irreducible physical concepts are electrically charged physical objects and space - like virtual photons .",
    "coulomb s law is a consequence of the exchange of the latter between the former .",
    "hamilton s principle is naturally given by the classical limit of the fpi formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is interesting , in the light of this ` complete understanding ' that quantum mechanics and relativity provide about cem , to consider two further quotations from the _ principia_. the first is taken from the ` general scholium '  @xcite . after describing the inverse - square law of the gravitational force newton states :    but hitherto i have not been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena , and i frame no hypothesis , for whatever is not derived from the phenomena is to be called a hypothesis , and hypotheses , whether metaphysical or physical , whether of occult qualities or mechanical , have no place in experimental philosophy .",
    "the second is from the ` author s preface to the reader '  @xcite    i wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles , for i am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies , by some causes hitherto unknown , are either mutually impelled towards one another and cohere in regular figures or are repelled and recede from one another .    now , at the beginning of the 21st century , newton s wish to understand , at a deeper level , the forces of nature , has been granted , at least for the case of electromagnetic ones .",
    "what was needed was not ` the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles ' that newton considered but the discovery of relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the cause ` hitherto unknown ' of the electromagnetic force is the exchange of space - like virtual photons according to the known laws of qed .",
    "regrettably science is , at the time of this writing , riddled by many ` hypotheses ' of the type referred to in the first of the above quotations .",
    "one such hypothesis , that has persisted through much of the 19th century and all of the 20th is that : ` no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light ' .",
    "this is contradicted by the arguments given above and , as discussed in the following section , also by the results of some recent experiments .",
    "the starting point and aims of the present paper are very close to those of feynman and wheeler when they attempted , in the early 1940 s , to reformulate cem in terms of direct inter - charge interactions without the _ a priori _ introduction of any electromagnetic field concept . in this way",
    "the infinite self - energy terms associated with the electric field of a point charge are eliminated . as feynman put it  @xcite :    you see then that my general plan was to first solve the classical problem , to get rid of the infinite self - energies in the classical theory , and to hope that when i made a quantum theory of it everything would bejust fine .",
    "feynman and wheeler had a project to write three papers on the subject  @xcite .",
    "the first of these papers was to be a study of the classical limit of the quantum theory of radiation .",
    "feynman had yet to formulate his space - time version of qed , and this paper was never written . in the remaining two papers",
    "@xcite it was proposed to introduce direct interparticle action by including the effects of both retarded and ` advanced ' potentials as well as an array of ` absorbers ' . as suggested by dirac  @xcite half of the difference between the retarded potential of an accelerated charge and of the ` advanced ' potential from the absorbers",
    "correctly predicts the known radiative damping force of cem . the second paper ,  @xcite , developed further this theory by exploiting the fokker action principle formulation of action - at - a - distance in cem  @xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction of this paper , a description was being sought that was :      that is , in other words , in accordance with newton s first ` rule of reasoning in philosophy ' quoted above .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the known results of cem by such a theory ` advanced ' potentials had to be introduced .",
    "this immediately gives an apparent breakdown of causality and the logical distinction between ` past ' , ` present ' and ` future ' .",
    "as concisely stated by feynman and wheeler themselves  @xcite :    the apparent conflict with causality begins with the thought : if the present motion of @xmath254 is affected by the future motion of @xmath255 , then the observation of @xmath254 attributes a certain inevitabilty to the motion of @xmath255 . is not this conclusion in conflict with our recognised ability to influence the future motion of @xmath255 ?",
    "in fact , feynman and wheeler were compelled to introduce ` advanced ' potentials because they were assuming , as did also fokker and earlier authors attempting to formulate theories of direct interparticle action in cem , that causality meant that no physical influence could be transmitted faster than the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "this definition of ` causality ' seems to have been introduced into physics by c.f.gauss in 1845  @xcite .",
    "somewhat later , c.neumann proposed  @xcite that the electric potential responsible for interparticle forces should be transmitted , not at the speed of light , but instantaneously , like the gravitational force in newton s theory .",
    "as shown above , this is indeed how , in qed , space - like virtual photons transmit the electromagnetic force between charged objects in their common cm frame .",
    "these two hypotheses will be refered to below below as ` gaussian ' and ` neumann ' causality .",
    "the fundamental lagrangian of cem describing the interaction of charged objects , in any inertial frame , is the simple expression eqn(2.7 ) above , not the conjectured , and much more complicated , fokker action that embodies gaussian causality .",
    "it is important to stress that the instantaneous action - at - a - distance , of neumann causality , which is just the limit of gaussian causality as @xmath256 , unlike an ` advanced ' potential , poses no logical problem of the influence of the future on the present , as succinctly stated by feynman and wheeler in the above quotation .",
    "gaussian causality has been an unstated ( and unquestioned ) axiom of physics since the advent of special relativity a century ago .",
    "the speed of light is certainly the limiting velocity of any physical object described by a time - like energy - momentum 4-vector .",
    "however einstein at the time when he invented special relativity , and feynman himself , at the time of his collaboration with wheeler , were not aware of the concept of the ` virtual ' particles .",
    "the latter , associated with the space - time propagators introduced into qed by feynman and stueckelberg , may be described by space - like energy - momentum 4-vectors .",
    "the instantaneous action at a distance of the virtual photons in mller scattering described by the invariant amplitude in eqn(6.6 ) above , can be simply understood from the relativistic kinematics of such virtual particles .",
    "the relativistic velocity @xmath257 of a particle in terms of its 3-momentum @xmath258 and 4-momentum @xmath171 is , in general , given by the expression : @xmath259 thus space - like virtual particles , for which , by definition : @xmath260 , are tachyons . for the case of the virtual photons exchanged in the center - of - mass - system of mller scattering ( figs1b and 1c ) : @xmath261 , since @xmath262 , and so @xmath93 is infinite , consistent with the space - time description in eqn(6.6 ) .    that the feynman propagator for a _ massive _ particle violates gaussian causality",
    "was pointed out by feynman himself in his first qed paper  @xcite and later discussed by him in considerable detail  @xcite .",
    "this fact is also sometimes mentioned in books on quantum field theory , that otherwise make the contradictory claim that , in general , quantum field operators commute for space - like separations , so that , in consequence , no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light in section 1.3.1 it is stated that : ` while the previous green functions were zero outside the light cone this is not the case for @xmath263 which has an exponential tail at negative @xmath264 . '",
    "the @xmath263 discussed here is that corresponding to a classical field , but the corresponding quantum propagator , @xmath265 , has a similar property  @xcite . ]",
    "the space time propagator of a massive particle was shown by feynman to be , in general , a hankel function of the second kind  @xcite .",
    "for an on - shell particle , or a virtual particle propagating over a large proper time interval , @xmath266 , the propagator has a simpler functional dependence @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the pole mass of the particle and the proper time interval is defined by the relations : @xmath269 @xmath270 for space - like separations : @xmath271 appropriate for the virtual photons mediating the coulomb force , @xmath272 is imaginary .",
    "this would imply an exponentially damped range of the associated force for the exchange of a massive particle .",
    "since , however , the pole mass of the photon vanishes , no such damping occurs for the exchange of virtual photons .",
    "the corresponding force law is then the same as for the exchange of real ( ` on - shell ' ) particles , that is , inverse square .",
    "it is instructive to compare feynman s own discussion of the virtual photon propagator in space - time  @xcite to the related one of the invariant amplitude for mller scattering in section 6 above .",
    "feynman writes out explicitly the 4-vector product in eqn(6.1 ) to obtain : @xmath273 conservation of the current @xmath274 gives the condition : @xmath275 where the 3 axis has been chosen parallel to @xmath276 .",
    "use of ( 7.3 ) to eliminate @xmath277 and @xmath278 enables ( 7.2 ) to be written as : @xmath279 d^4x_a\\ ] ] feynman then performs a fourier transform of @xmath280 using eqn(6.5 ) to obtain , for the last term in the large square bracket of eqn(7.4 ) an equation similar to ( 6.6 ) above , but with the replacement : @xmath281 . the instantaneous nature of the coulomb interaction in this term is noted , but it is also implied that the contribution of the transverse polarisation modes : @xmath282 is not instantaneous .",
    "feynman stated :        it is amusing to note that a faint ` ghost ' of wheeler and feynman s ` advanced ' and ` retarded ' potentials subsists in the momentum space diagrams fig.1b and 1c .",
    "the two kinematically distinct situations ( i ) a virtual photon with momentum @xmath285 propagates from current a to current b ( fig1b ) and ( ii ) a virtual photon with momentum @xmath286 propagates from current b to current a ( fig1c ) are completely equivalent descriptions of the scattering process in the cm frame where @xmath287 . as shown in fig 2 , however , this is no longer the the case if the scattering process is observed in a different inertial frame . in fig 2a",
    "the observer is moving with relativistic velocity @xmath288 parallel to the direction of @xmath289 in the cm frame . thus in the observer s proper frame ,",
    "@xmath290 is halved and @xmath291 doubled . in fig2b ,",
    "the observer moves with the same velocity relative to the cm frame , parallel to @xmath292 . in both cases it follows from momentum conservation that there is no possible ambiguity between the momentum space configurations shown in figs 2a and 2b . in fig 2a",
    "the virtual photon must propagate from current a to b and so @xmath293 , and in fig 2b from current b to a so that @xmath294 . assuming that the electrons are ultrarelativistic , @xmath295 , and that the electrons scatter through @xmath296 rad in the cm frame , as shown in fig 1 , the relativistic velocity of the virtual photon in the observer s frame is @xmath297 for both cases shown in fig 2 .",
    "thus the causal description of scattering processes in momentum space is , in general , frame dependent , being ambiguous only in the cm frame .",
    "because of this ambiguity , in the kinematical configuration of fig 1b , the virtual photon @xmath298 can be considered as the limit as @xmath299 of an ` retarded ' interaction from a as seen by b , whereas in fig 1c @xmath300 corresponds to the limit as @xmath299 of an ` advanced ' interaction produced by b that interacts with a. since the two descriptions are equivalent , the effect is the same as the @xmath299 limit of half the sum of the retarded interaction produced by the current b and the ` advanced ' interaction produced by the current a. this is the ` ghost ' of feynman and wheeler s advanced and retarded potentials mentioned above .",
    "the current a ( b ) behaves as the ` absorber ' for the interactions of the current b ( a ) . unlike in feynman and wheeler s formulation",
    "however there is no radiation and therefore no ` radiation resistance ' .",
    "the photons responsible for the intercharge interaction are purely virtual .",
    "as often emphasised by feynman  @xcite , qed is based on only three elementary amplitudes describing , respectively , the propagation of electrons or photons from one space - time point to another and the amplitude for an electron to absorb or emit a photon .",
    "the latter is proportional to the classical electric charge of the electron .",
    "since only kinematics , and not the coupling constant of qed , changes when virtual photons are replaced by real ones it should not be surprising if the various field concepts introduced to describe the effect of the virtual photons that generate intercharge forces should also be able to provide a description of the observed effects of the creation and absorption of real photons . as will now be shown ,",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "a clear distinction should be made however , at the outset , between the fields so far discussed in the present paper , representing the effects of virtual photon exchange , and the related fields denoted here as @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 that provide a description of physical systems comprised of large numbers of real photons .",
    "as shown in a recent paper by the present author  @xcite , a complex representation of these radiation fields may be identified , in the limit of very low photon density , with the quantum wavefunction of a single real photon    the electrodynamic maxwell equation ( 4.20 ) as written above therefore describes only the effects of virtual photon exchange .",
    "all fields and currents are defined at some unique time in the cm frame of the interacting charges .",
    "the solutions of this equation , @xmath110 ,  @xmath125 are given by eqns(3.11 ) , ( 3.12 ) respectively and ( 3.1 ) .",
    "to arrive at a description of real photons it is convenient to express the electrodynamic ampre law of eqn(4.20 ) uniquely in terms of the 3-vector potential by using the lorenz condition ( 4.12 ) to eliminate the scalar potential @xmath167 .",
    "the result of this simple exercise in 3-vector algebra , which may be found in any text - book on cem , is : @xmath304 the ` radiation ' suffix has been added to @xmath164 and @xmath166 to distinguish them from the quantities @xmath164 and @xmath166 defined in eqns(3.1 ) and ( 4.8 ) since the latter are not solutions of eqn(7.5 ) unless @xmath305 is infinite . similarly by using the lorenz condition to eliminate @xmath306 in favour of @xmath167 the inhomogeneous dalembert equation for the scalar potential",
    "may be derived : @xmath307 as shown for example in reference  @xcite , the solutions of eqn(7.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) are similar to ( 3.1 ) except that they are retarded in time : @xmath308 @xmath309 where the large curly bracket indicates that @xmath166 and @xmath101 are evaluated at the retarded time @xmath310 .",
    "it follows that @xmath311 and the associated electromagnetic fields @xmath312 and @xmath313 describe some physical effect produced by the source current at time @xmath310 , i.e. that propagates from the source to the point of observation with velocity @xmath305 . in reality , the energy - momentum flux , associated with the corresponding ` electromagnetic wave ' produced by the source , consists of a very large number of real photons whose energy distribution depends on the acceleration of the source at their moment of emission .",
    "thus the solutions ( 7.7 ) and ( 7.8 ) imply the existence of massless physical objects ( ` photons ' )  @xcite , created by the source current . as discussed in reference  @xcite , comparison of the known properties of both photons and the classical electromagnetic waves associated with the fields @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 enables many fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics to be understood in a simple way .",
    "text books and papers on cem do not usually make the above distinction between the fields @xmath110 and @xmath125 , describing the mechanical forces acting on charges , and @xmath302 and @xmath303 that provide the classical description of radiation phenomena , employing identical symbols for both types of fields . an important exception to this is the work of reference  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the instantaneous nature of the interactions mediated by the @xmath110 and @xmath125 fields , derived in the previous section from qed , is conjectured .",
    "these fields are solutions of the maxwell equations : ( 4.4 ) , ( 4.6 ) , ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.20 ) .",
    "different , retarded , fields , solutions of the dalembert equation , equivalent to @xmath302 and @xmath303 , denoted as @xmath314 and @xmath315 were also introduced .",
    "the application of the poynting vector and spatial energy density formulae uniquely to the fields @xmath314 and @xmath315 was pointed out . however , instead of the formulae ( 7.7 ) and ( 7.8 ) above , only ` sourceless ' solutions of the homogeeous dalembert equation were considered .",
    "also it was proposed , instead of the formulae ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.16 ) above , to define @xmath110 and @xmath125 as the standard ` present time ' linard and wichert formulae which , for a uniformly moving charge , are actually equivalent to _ retarded _ fields .",
    "the discussion of reference  @xcite . was carried out entirely at the level of classical fields , considered as solutions of partial differential equations with certain boundary conditions .",
    "no identification of @xmath110 and @xmath125 with the exchange of virtual photons and @xmath314 and @xmath315 as the classical description of real photons was made .",
    "the suggestion that @xmath110 and @xmath125 should be associated with exchange of virtual photons ` not subject to causal limitations ' has , however , been made in a recent paper  @xcite    the electric and magnetic fields derived from the linard and wiechert potentials ( 7.7 ) and ( 7.8 ) contain terms with both @xmath316 and @xmath195 dependencies . both fields are retarded , but conventionally only the latter are associated with radiative effects ( the fields @xmath302 and @xmath303 ) in cem .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is now mounting experimental evidence  @xcite , that the fields @xmath317 are instantaneous and not retarded , and so should be associated with the force fields @xmath110 and @xmath125 mediated by virtual photon exchange . particularly convincing",
    "are the results shown in reference  @xcite where the temporal dependence of near- and far - magnetic fields were investigated by measuring electromagnetic induction at different distances from a circular antenna .",
    "figure 8 of  @xciteapparently shows clear evidence for the instantaneous nature of the @xmath316 ` bound fields ' ( i.e. fields associated with virtual photon exchange ) .",
    "this suggests that the retarded @xmath316 solutions of ( 7.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) should be discarded as unphysical , whereas the retarded @xmath195 solutions describing correctly the ` far - field ' in the experiment  @xcite do give the correct classical description of the radiation of real photons .",
    "there seems now to be therefore experimental evidence for electromagnetic fields respecting both neumann causality ( the force fields @xmath110 and @xmath125 ) as well as gaussian causality ( the radiation fields @xmath302 and @xmath303 ) .",
    "maxwell s original discovery of electromagnetic waves  @xcite was based on an equation similar to ( 7.5 ) for components of the electromagnetic fields , but without any source term , which is just the well - known classical wave equation in three spatial dimensions although this procedure leads , in a heuristic manner , to the concept of ` electromagnetic waves ' propagating at speed @xmath305 , with vast practical , political and sociological consequences , it can be seen , with hindsight , to have been a mistake from the viewpoint of fundamental physics .",
    "in fact , if the current vanishes , so , by definition , do all the fields whether instantaneous as in eqn(3.1 ) or retarded as in eqn(7.5 )",
    ". if all the fields vanish there can evidently be no ` waves ' .",
    "the result of this mistake was many decades of fruitless work by maxwell and others to invent a medium ( the luminiferous aether ) in which such ` sourceless ' waves might propagate and whose properties would predict the value of @xmath305 .",
    "now it is understood that the energy density @xmath318 of a plane ` electromagnetic wave ' is simply that of the beam of real photons of which it actually consists  @xcite .",
    "the existence of photons , massless particles with constant velocity c , is predicted by eqn(7.5 ) that necessarily follows from eqns(4.12 ) and ( 4.20 ) .",
    "these in turn may be derived from the lagrangian ( 2.7 ) and hamilton s principle .",
    "it is then interesting to ask where the constant ` c ' was introduced into the derivation .",
    "the answer is eqn(2.2 ) , the definition of 4-vector velocity .",
    "the same formula contains , implicitly , the information that a massless particle has the constant velocity , c , that is used to identify the electromagnetic wave , with velocity c predicted by eqns(7.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) , with the propagation of the massless real photons produced by the source .",
    "the only dynamical assumption in the derivation of cem presented above is coulomb s law .",
    "if it is explained in qed as an effect due to virtual photon exchange , it also seems to require via eqns(7.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) , the existence of real , massless , photons .",
    "although clearly of interest , the further study of the relationship between cem and qed for radiative processes is , as stated earlier , beyond the scope of the present paper .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results obtained in the present paper are compared with those of the similarly motivated project of feynman and wheeler .",
    "the latter made the following general comments on their approach  @xcite :          the statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) remain true in the approach described in sections 2 - 4 above .",
    "however the writer opinion is that the ` infinite self energy ' problem of cem is really an artifact of the possibly unphysical concept of a ` point charge ' rather than a shortcoming of the classical electromagnetic field concept _ per se_. that being said , it remains true that the virtual photons interacting with a given charge are produced by other charges so there is no way for the charge to ` interact with itself ' .",
    "if the energy of the ` electromagentic field ' is identified with that of the exchanged virtual photons in the cm frame , it vanishes , so , there is , as in ( 2 ) above , certainly no self energy problem .",
    "however , the statements ( 1)and ( 2 ) are only applicable to the ` force ' fields introduced in eqns(3.1 ) , ( 3.10 ) and ( 3.12 ) above , that may be denoted as @xmath319 , @xmath320 and @xmath321 to distingish them from the ` radiation ' fields describing real photons .",
    "it is important to reiterate that the definitions and physical meanings of these two types of fields are quite distinct .",
    "the quantity : @xmath322 does not correctly describe the energy density of the electromagnetic field associated with virtual photons , and , in contradiction to ( 1 ) , extra degrees of freedom must be added to the lagrangian to correctly describe real photons .",
    "no distinction was made between real and virtual photons by feynman and wheeler . in the approach of the present paper , point",
    "( 3 ) with its introduction of acausal ` advanced ' potentials is no longer valid .",
    "it was a consequence of feynman and wheeler s taking gaussian causality as an axiom .",
    "the latter is true , as shown by eqn(7.7 ) and ( 7.8 ) , for any interaction transmitted by real photons ( i.e. for the fields @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 ) but not , as shown in section 5 above , for the force fields describing the effects of the exchange of space - like virtual photons .",
    "these are always tachyonic ( as in fig.2 ) and may be instantaneous ( as in fig1b and c ) but do not , unlike ` advanced potentials ' , violate causality .",
    "feynman and wheeler s mistake , the same as that of many previous authors , was to try to describe the physical effects of virtual photon exchange by fields respecting gaussian , instead of neumann , causality .",
    "it is instructive to compare the discussion of cem in the present paper with that of reference  @xcite , which also takes as fundamental physical assumptions , in constructing the theory , special relativity and hamilton s principle .",
    "however in reference  @xcite , the existence of the 4-vector potental @xmath78 and the relativistic lagrangian equivalent to ( 3.2 ) above are both postulated _ a priori_. this procedure is justified by the statement  @xcite :    the assertions which follow should be regarded as being , to a certain extent , the consequence of experimental data .",
    "the form of the action for a particle in an electromagnetic field can not be fixed on the basis of general considerations alone ( such as , for example the requirement of relativistic invariance ) .",
    "this is true , as far as it goes , but fails to take account of either the constructive principle put forward in the quotation from hagedorn cited above , or the known essential physics of the problem embodied in the inverse - square force law between charges in the static limit .",
    "as demonstrated in section 2 above , the assumption of this law , together with the classical definition of potential energy and relativistic invariance is in fact sufficient to derive just the lagrangian that is assumed _ a priori _ in  @xcite .",
    "the derivations of the lorentz force equation and the covariant definitions of electric and magnetic fields ( 3.11 ) and ( 3.12 ) given in  @xcite are identical to those presented above , as are also the derivations of the magnetostatic maxwell equation and the faraday - lenz law . in chapter 3 of  @xcite",
    "there is a lengthy discussion of the motion of particles in magnetic fields .",
    "however at this point the magnetic field is a purely abstract mathematical concept . how it may be obtained from its sources @xmath323 charges in motion",
    "@xmath323 has still not been even mentioned ! only after the electrostatic and electrodynamic maxwell equations have been derived in chapter 4 from the principle of least action , by treating the electromagnetic fields as ` co - ordinates ' , is the relation between fields and their sources established .",
    "coulomb s law is then derived at the begining of chapter 5 ( page 100 ! ) from the poisson equation .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper , coulomb s law ( and hence the poisson equation ) is assumed at the outset , and the electromagnetic maxwell equation is derived , simply by inspection , from the covariant form of poisson s equation . at this point identical results have been obtained from the same essential input ( the lagrangian ( 3.2 ) ) by the present paper and  @xcite . however the present writer feels that there are enormous pedagogical advantages , ( especially in view of the crucial role of coulomb s law in qed , discussed above ) to start the discussion with the vital experimental fact @xmath323 the inverse - square force law @xmath323 rather than to derive it after 100 pages of complicated mathematics , as is done in  @xcite .",
    "also , in  @xcite no distinction is made between @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 and @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 .",
    "all fields are assumed to be derived from the same , non - relativistic , retarded , linard and wichert potentials .",
    "finally the approach of the present paper may be compared with that of another recent paper by the present author  @xcite in which the lorentz force law , magnetic field concept and the faraday - lenz law are derived from a different set of postulates .",
    "the electrostatic definition of the electric field @xmath324 is first generalised to the covariant form of eqn(3.11 ) above by imposing space - time exchange symmetry invariance  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field concept and the lorentz force law are then shown to follow from the covariance of eqn(3.11 ) , and the derivation of the faraday - lenz law is identical to that given above .",
    "neither coulomb s law nor hamilton s principle were invoked in this case , demonstrating the robustness of some essential formulae of cem to the choice of axioms for their derivation .",
    "another example of this is provided by reference  @xcite where coulomb s law is derived from the principle of least action and the relativistic lagrangian ( 3.2 ) , as initial postulates .",
    "i thank b.echenard and p.enders for their comments on this paper .",
    "pertinent and constructive critical comments by an anonymous referee have enabled me to simplify , or improve , the presentation in several places .",
    "they are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "factoring out the space - time dependent factor in the transition current @xmath325 according to the definition @xmath326       \\nonumber \\\\     & \\equiv & \\tilde{{\\cal j}}_{\\mu }   \\exp[i(p_f - p_i ) \\cdot x]~~~~~~~(a1 ) \\nonumber          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] enables the invariant amplitude @xmath327 of eqn(6.4 ) to be written as : @xmath328 since , from momentum conservation : @xmath329 using now eqn(6.5 ) gives @xmath330 making the change of variables : @xmath331 and noting that @xmath332 gives , from eqn(a4 ) : @xmath333 now @xmath334 where eqn(a3 ) has been used . substituting ( a6 ) into ( a5 ) , yields eqn(6.6 ) of the text .",
