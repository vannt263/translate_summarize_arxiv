    "evaporative contact line deposition , the coffee - drop effect , has been the subject of several recent papers  @xcite .",
    "the physical problem originates from a simple phenomenon of everyday life : when a drop containing a solute such as coffee dries on a surface , the solute is driven to the contact line , forming a characteristic ring pattern .",
    "this simple phenomenon is potentially important in many areas of both scientific and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "this evaporation mechanism can create very fine lines of deposition in a robust way that requires no explicit forming .",
    "further , it is a way of concentrating material strongly in a quantitatively predictable way .",
    "lastly , it creates capillary flow patterns that can be useful for processing of polyatomic solutes like dna @xcite .",
    "one striking aspect of this deposition phenomenon is its dependence on the shape of the droplet .",
    "this dependence was recently explored by popov and witten @xcite , who studied corner - shaped drops . here",
    "the liquid region on the surface has the form of a sector of arbitrary opening angle @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "such shapes contrast strongly with the circular drops treated in previous studies @xcite .",
    "popov and witten found that this difference in shape led to striking differences in evaporative flow and deposition near the apex of the drop . both the flow and the deposition profile showed singular power - law behavior as a function of distance @xmath1 from the tip .",
    "these power laws vary in a predicted way with the opening angle , but are otherwise universal .",
    "the growth of the deposition also shows several different predicted behaviors in three defined time regimes .",
    "thus by manipulating the shape of a droplet one has extensive control over its deposition properties .    in this paper we further explore the range of control possible in evaporative deposition .",
    "this study is motivated by a finding from ref .  6 :",
    "the power laws governing the deposition depend on the evaporation conditions in the vicinity of the drop .",
    "6 considered the usual diffusion - controlled evaporation conditions , in which the liquid is surrounded by a dry surface and the evaporation rate is limited by the diffusion of vapor away from the drop . in these conditions concentration @xmath2 in the air obeys laplace s equation with @xmath3 at the surface set by the fixed saturation concentration . as in the analogous electrostatic problem ,",
    "the gradient of @xmath3 diverges at the edge and at the tip .",
    "the resulting divergent evaporation profiles contribute strongly to the controllable deposition properties found in ref .",
    "one may readily alter these evaporation conditions , and strong differences in the deposition are expected to result .",
    "we consider a condition that contrasts strongly with the singular evaporation treated in ref .",
    "viz_. _ uniform _ evaporation .",
    "this contrast is illustrated in fig .",
    "uniform evaporation can be created by surrounding the drop by a wet surface instead of a dry one , as illustrated in figure 1b .",
    "the wet - surface evaporation case allows us to discern the role of the evaporation profile in producing the power - law behaviors revealed by ref .",
    "the wet - surface evaporation case is also mathematically simpler to treat than the dry - surface case of ref .",
    "this allows us to make cleaner predictions with fewer approximations for the wet - surface case .",
    "[ ptb ]    our work is to a large extent a mere application of the general theory worked out in ref .",
    "we shall follow the same approach and exposition for the current case that was used in ref .",
    "before working out the quantitative behavior we describe the experiment qualitatively . a droplet of linear dimension @xmath4 is forced to have a corner shape over part of its perimeter .",
    "one may fix the edge of the drop _ e.g. _ by making shallow scratches in the surface .",
    "these serve to pin the contact line at the scratch .",
    "we choose @xmath4 smaller than a few millimeters so that gravitational effects on the droplet s shape are minor .",
    "we denote the maximal thickness of the drop by @xmath5 and keep the droplet volume small enough to assure that @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath4 .",
    "once the evaporation starts , the volume diminishes at a constant rate , and thus @xmath5 decreases linearly with time . at some final time @xmath7",
    "this thickness extrapolates to zero . like reference 6 ,",
    "we restrict our attention to time much less than this @xmath7 , and it will show later that for @xmath8 , in the early drying stages , the time dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be actually ignored .",
    "our predictive power is strongest for this regime .",
    "the shape of the droplet during this thinning process is dictated by its surface tension .",
    "near the edges , the local reduction in volume owing to thinning is much smaller than the local loss of volume to evaporation .",
    "thus a flow towards the edge is needed in order to replace the evaporative loss .",
    "any solute suspended in the fluid is carried along by this flow .",
    "the asymptotic flow near the tip is minimally influenced by the bulk of the drop , and thus this flow can be readily calculated .",
    "knowing this flow profile , one may deduce how much solute should be carried to a given point on the edge in a given time @xmath9 .",
    "this amount grows in a characteristic way with time and with distance from the tip .",
    "our aim is to see how the deposition is influenced by opening angle and how much this deposition differs from the dry - surface results of ref .",
    "the main difference is in the opposite direction from what one might expect .",
    "we find that the wet - surface evaporation leads to deposition that is more concentrated at the tip than the dry - surface deposition of ref .",
    "this is despite the diverging evaporation at the edges and tip produced in the dry - surface case .",
    "the paper is organized in parallel with ref .",
    "first , we review the basic physical model and its mathematical framework , which was introduced in ref .",
    "next , the system is solved both analytically and numerically : the flow field is described , and its asymptotic properties studied .",
    "we obtain the power law of the deposition rate in early time regime and intermediate time regime .",
    "then we compare our results with those of the dry - surface case . more discussion and conclusions follow in the last sections .",
    "following ref .  5 , we consider a droplet of very dilute suspension bounded in an angular region of opening angle @xmath0 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 defined in fig .",
    "[ figsetting ] with the range @xmath13 and @xmath14 , to describe our system .",
    "@xmath15 is the coordinate normal to the substrate .",
    "we first present the governing equations in generality and then specialize to the regime of interest : thin drops undergoing slow flows .",
    "[ ptb ]    settings1.eps    the equilibrium shape of the surface is dictated by the minimization of surface energy .",
    "the minimum energy surface has uniform mean curvature @xmath16 . specifically ,",
    "if the surface tension of the liquid is @xmath17 and the pressure difference across the surface is @xmath18 , then the balance of normal forces dictates:@xmath19 in the sequel , we shall represent the surface by its thickness profile @xmath20 , @xmath11 , @xmath21 .",
    "the mean curvature @xmath16 depends on the local derivatives of @xmath22 , to be specified below .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , evaporation induces a flow towards the edge of the drop . denoting the local velocity by @xmath23 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath21 with in - plane component @xmath24 , it is useful to define a depth - averaged velocity field @xmath25 @xmath26 the condition for local mass conservation",
    "may be stated in terms of this @xmath25:@xmath27 here @xmath28 is the density of the fluid , and @xmath29 the mass loss per unit projected area and time at the point in question . in ref .  6",
    ", this @xmath29 is a strong function of position , and it diverges at the contact line . in the present work ,",
    "it is a mere constant . by itself",
    ", this condition is not sufficient to determine @xmath25 .",
    "ultimately , @xmath25 is determined by newton s equations on each fluid element .",
    "we shall consider the creeping flow regime where forces are in near equilibrium and acceleration plays a negligible role in newton s equations .",
    "then newton s equations reduce to the stokes equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fluid pressure , and @xmath32 is the dynamic viscosity .",
    "the lack of inertia implies that @xmath25 is a potential - like flow , as shown below .",
    "further physical considerations and simplifications are needed to solve the system analytically .",
    "firstly , as we are considering a thin drop , there is a separation of the vertical and horizontal scales in this problem , and several simplifications follow @xcite .",
    "the pressure inside the drop @xmath31 does not depend on the @xmath15 coordinate @xmath33 .",
    "the surface of the drop should have a small slope @xmath34 . and",
    "the @xmath15-derivatives of flow dominate , i.e. , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 represents any direction parallel to the substrate plane , and @xmath37 refers to any velocity component . under these considerations , ( [ 4 ] ) has the form @xcite@xmath38 with boundary conditions : @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 with expressions ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , we have @xcite @xmath41 thus @xmath42 can be represented as a gradient of the scalar potential as announced above .",
    "the flow in the drop clearly depends on the relative importance of surface forces and viscous forces .",
    "this importance is ordinarily characterized by the capillary number @xmath43 . for water - like fluids ,",
    "the capillary number is small whenever @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "ordinary evaporating flows are in the range of @xmath46 @xmath45 ; accordingly , viscous forces may be considered as weak in comparison to surface tension .",
    "thus we anticipate that the shape of the drop is nearly the equilibrium shape in the absence of the flow .",
    "to establish this formally and systematically , we express the pressure and height as expansions in the capillary number : @xmath47 and @xmath48 . by using these expansions in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , we find the lowest order results @xcite @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 and the leading term @xmath53 does not vary with local coordinates and is only a function of time @xmath9 .",
    "thus , one can use eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) to determine the equilibrium drop surface shape @xmath54 , then solve eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) with respect to @xmath55 , and finally determine the velocity field from eq .",

    "[ 8 ] ) introduces a length scale into the problem , i.e. , the mean radius of curvature @xmath58 . since the evaporation rate is constant in time , the droplet volume and thus its thickness decrease linearly in time until the terminal time @xmath7 .",
    "this means @xcite that the mean curvature @xmath59 can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial mean radius of curvature , and @xmath7 is the total drying time . thus in the early drying stages ( @xmath62 ) , which is the only case we are to consider in this paper",
    ", the time dependence of @xmath63 can be ignored , and the shape of the drop can be assumed to vary with time adiabatically ( i.e. , slowly compared to all other processes ) .",
    "we may generally treat @xmath64 as constant @xmath61 in the rest of the paper , keeping in mind its time dependence ( [ 10d ] ) .",
    "if written explicitly in terms of @xmath65 , equation ( [ 8 ] ) reduces to the poisson equation under the assumption of small slope of the surface : @xmath66 with boundary conditions @xmath67 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath68 is the mean radius of curvature , and we are only interested in the asymptotic limit @xmath69 .",

    "the leading term of the solution in the limit @xmath70 is different for acute and obtuse angles and can be obtained by either solving the small - slope ( horizontal ) equation ( [ 11 ] ) or by the series expansion of the full equation ( [ 8 ] ) . by both methods , the lowest order term in @xmath1 of the series expansion of the surface shape @xmath22 was found in ref .  5 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 exponent @xmath73 as a function of the opening angle @xmath0 is shown in fig .",

    "a _ local similarity _ solution is valid , i.e. , the solution that has no arbitrary coefficients and is independent of the remote boundary conditions in the bulk of the drop that need to be further prescribed . physically , the surface shape of the drop near the tip is controlled locally and is independent of the physical conditions far from the tip . for obtuse opening angles ,",
    "however , the local similarity does not hold , and the surface shape is no longer controlled locally .",
    "accordingly , the coefficient @xmath77 depends on the remote boundary conditions .",
    "this contrast between acute and obtuse opening angles leads to different flow behavior and different deposition properties as will be shown later .",
