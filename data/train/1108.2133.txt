    "the use of type ia supernovae as standardized light sources @xmath1 * calibrated candles * @xmath1 led to the observational discovery of dark energy by two groups in 1998 ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . before the accelerated expansion of the universe was revealed by high red - shift supernovae ia ( sne ia ) observations ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , it could hardly be presumed that the main ingredients of the universe are dark sectors .",
    "the concept of dark energy was proposed for understanding this currently accelerating expansion of the universe , and then its existence was confirmed by several high precision observational experiments ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ; spergel et al . 2003",
    "; tegmark et al . 2004 ; abazajian et al . 2004 ; hawkins et al . 2003 ; verde et al .",
    "2002 ) , especially the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite experiment .",
    "the wmap shows that dark energy occupies about @xmath2of the energy of the universe , and dark matter about @xmath3 .",
    "the usual baryon matter , which can be described by our known particle theory , occupies only about @xmath4 of the total energy of the universe .",
    "measurements as of 2008 , with the greatest weight coming from the combination of supernovae with either cosmic microwave background or baryon acoustic oscillation data , show that dark energy makes up @xmath5 of the total energy density of the universe , and its equation of state averaged over the last 7 billion years is @xmath6 ( kowalski et al .",
    "this is consistent with the simplest picture , the cosmological constant , but also with a great many scenarios of time varying dark energy or extended gravity theories . in order to explain why the cosmic acceleration happens ,",
    "many theories have been proposed .",
    "although theories of trying to modify einstein equations constitute a big part of these attempt , the mainstream explanation for this problem , however , is known as theories of dark energies .",
    "it is the most accepted idea that a mysterious dominant component , dark energy ( de ) , with negative pressure , leads to this cosmic acceleration , though its nature and cosmological origin still remain enigmatic at present . in the concordance model ,",
    "the energy content of the universe is dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the hubble constant which we parameterize as @xmath10 .",
    "the second component of the concordance model is pressure - less matter with @xmath11 , where g is newton s constant .",
    "+ the simplest candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant .",
    "it is , however , plagued with the so - called coincidence problem and the cosmological constant problem ( weinberg 1989 ; sahni and starobinsky 2000 ; peebles and ratra 2003 ; padmanabhan 2003 ; copeland et al .",
    "another possible form of dark energy is provided by scalar fields .",
    "thus some dynamical scalar field , such as quintessence ( wetterich 1988 ; ratra and peebles 1988 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) , phantom ( caldwell 2002 ; nojiri and odintsov 2003 , 2005 ; sahni and shtanov 2003 ; xiangyun et al .",

    "; setare 2006 ; cai et al .",
    "2007 ) and k - essence ( alimohammadi and sadjadi 2006 ; wei et al . 2007 ) , are proposed as possible candidate of dark energy .",
    "however , it is worth mentioned here that for these scalar field models the coincident problem still remains .",
    "although the two dark components are usually studied under the assumption that there is no interaction between them , one can not exclude such a possibility .",
    "in fact , researches show that a presumed interaction may help alleviate the coincident problem ( chimento et al .",
    "2003 ; chimento and pavon 2006 ) .",
    "a more comprehensive review is provided in copeland et al .",

    ", @xmath17 , and @xmath18 : @xmath19 ( amanullah et al . 2010 ) . since the quintessence has the property with the eos @xmath20 and the phantom behaves as @xmath21 , we can speculate that the quintom dark energy is a two - component system containing quintessence and phantom .",
    "the of de increases with the increase of scale factor , and both the scale factor and the phantom energy density can become infinite at a finite time @xmath22 , a condition known as the `` big rip '' ( caldwell 2002 ; caldwell et al .",
    "2003 ; frampton and takahashi 2003 ; nesseris and perivolaropoulos 2004 ) .",
    "the closer examination shows that the condition @xmath21 is not sufficient for a singularity occurrence .",
    "first of all , a transition phantom cosmology is quite possible .",
