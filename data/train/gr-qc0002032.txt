    "the majority of binary pulsars is found to be in orbit with a white - dwarf companion . due to the mass transfer in the past ,",
    "these systems have very small orbital eccentricities and , therefore , neither the relativistic advance of periastron nor the einstein delay were measured for any of these binary pulsars .",
    "in fact , the only post - keplerian parameters measured with reasonable accuracy for a small - eccentricity binary pulsar are the two shapiro parameters in case of psr b1855 + 09 ( kaspi _ et al .",
    "however , since the orbital period of this system is 12.3 days , the expected gravitational wave damping of the orbital motion is by far too small to be of any importance for timing observations and , consequently , there is no third post - keplerian parameter which would allow the kind of test conducted in double - neutron - star systems ( damour & taylor 1992 ) . on the other hand , many alternative theories of gravity , tensor - scalar theories for instance , predict effects that depend strongly on the difference between the gravitational self energy per unit mass ( @xmath0 ) of the two masses of a binary systems ( will 1993 ; damour & esposito - farse 1996ab ) .",
    "while this difference in binding energies is comparably small for double - neutron - star systems , it is large in neutron star - white dwarf systems since for a white dwarf @xmath1 while for a 1.4@xmath2 neutron star @xmath3 .",
    "unlike general relativity , many alternative theories of gravity predict the presence of all radiative multipoles  monopole and dipole , as well as quadrupole and higher multipoles ( will 1993 ) . for binary systems scalar - tensor theories , for instance ,",
    "predict a loss of orbital energy which at highest order is dominated by scalar dipole radiation . as a result ,",
    "the orbital period , @xmath4 , of a circular binary system should change according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the mass of the pulsar and its companion , respectively , @xmath8 is the ` bare ' gravitational constant and @xmath9 the speed of light .",
    "the total scalar charge of each star is proportional to its mass and its ` effective coupling strength ' @xmath10 ( damour & esposito - farse 1996b ) .",
    "for a white dwarf companion @xmath11 and thus the expression @xmath12 in equation ( 1 ) can be of the order one if the pulsar develops a significant amount of scalar charge . in this case",
    "the gravitational wave damping of the orbit is completely dominated by the emission of gravitational dipole radiation .",
    "psr j1012 + 5307 is a 5.3 ms pulsar in a 14.5 h circular orbit with a low mass white - dwarf companion . since its discovery in 1993 ( nicastro _ et al._1995 )",
    "this pulsar has been timed on a regular basis using the jodrell bank 76-m and the effelsberg 100-m radiotelescope , sometimes achieving a timing accuracy of 500 ns after just 10 min of integration ( lange _ et al .  _ , this conference ) .",
    "in addition , the white - dwarf companion appears to be relatively bright ( @xmath13 ) and shows strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "based on white dwarf model calculations , a companion mass of @xmath14 and a distance of @xmath15 pc was derived ( van kerkwijk _",
    "_ 1996 , callanan _ et al .",
    "further , a reliable radial velocity curve for the white dwarf has been extracted , which then , in combination with the pulsar timing information , gave a mass for the pulsar of @xmath16 .",
    "since  @xmath17 for this binary system , we find from equation ( 1 ) @xmath18 simulations show , that this value should improve by a factor of five within the next three years ( lange _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep . )",
    "the _ strong equivalence principle ( sep ) _ requires the universality of free fall of all objects in an external gravitational field regardless of their mass , composition and fraction of gravitational self - energy . while all metric theories of gravity share the property of universality of free fall of test particles ( weak equivalence principle ) , many of them , which are considered as realistic alternatives to general relativity , predict a violation of the sep .",
    "a violation of the sep can be understood as an inequality between the gravitational mass , @xmath19 , and the inertial mass , @xmath20 , which can be written as function of @xmath21 : @xmath22 while the analysis of lunar - laser - ranging data tightly constrains the ` nordtvedt parameter ' @xmath23 ( mller _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) it indicates nothing about a violation of the sep in strong - field regimes , i.e.  terms of higher order in @xmath21 , due to the smallness of @xmath21 for solar - system bodies . for neutron stars , however , @xmath24 and thus binary - pulsars with white - dwarf companions ( @xmath25 ) provide ideal laboratories for testing a violation of the sep due to nonlinear properties of the gravitational interaction ( damour & schfer 1991 ) .    in case of a violation of the sep",
    "the eccentricity vector of a small - eccentricity binary - pulsar system exposed to the external gravitational field of the galaxy , @xmath26 , is a superposition of a constant vector @xmath27 and a vector @xmath28 which is turning in the orbital plane with the rate of the relativistic advance of periastron .",
    "the ` induced ' eccentricity @xmath29 points into the direction of the projection of the galactic acceleration onto the orbital plane , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . however",
    ", neither the length of @xmath32 nor its rotational phase @xmath33 are known quantities .",
    "we therefore have to proceed as follows . given a certain @xmath34 , i.e.  a certain @xmath35 for a given binary pulsar , the observed eccentricity @xmath36 sets an upper limit to @xmath37 which is independent of @xmath38 : @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 ( wex 1997 ) .",
    "we now have to calculate an upper limit for @xmath33 for every observed small - eccentricity binary pulsar and compare the result with monte - carlo simulations of a large number of ( cumulative ) distributions for the ( uniformly distributed ) angle @xmath33 .",
    "this way , by counting the number of simulated distributions which are in agreement with the ` observed ' limits , one obtains the confidence level with which a certain @xmath43 is excluded . as a safe upper limit for @xmath44",
    "we find @xmath45 note , in order to calculate @xmath35 for a given binary system , we need also the masses of pulsar and companion and the location and orientation of the binary system in the galaxy . if there are no restrictions from timing and optical observations , the pulsar masses were assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range @xmath46 , the companion masses were taken from evolutionary scenarios ( tauris & savonije 1999 ) , and the pulsar distances were estimated using the taylor - cordes model assuming a typical error of 25% ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) .",
    "finally , the orientation of the ascending node in the sky , which is an unobservable parameter for all our binary system , was treated as variable which is uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath47 .      if gravity is mediated in part by a long - range vector field or by a second tensor field one",
    "expects the global matter distribution in the universe to select a preferred frame for the gravitational interaction ( will & nordtvedt 1972 ) . at the post - newtonian level ,",
    "gravitational effects associated with such a _ violation of the local lorentz invariance _ of gravity are characterized by two theory dependent parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath48 were different from zero , the eccentricity of a binary system which moves with respect to the global matter distribution in the universe would suffer a secular change similar to a violation of the sep .",
    "this time , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the velocity of the binary system with respect to the preferred frame , i.e.  the cosmic microwave background .",
    "again , we can perform a mote - carlo analysis as outlined in the previous section to derive the upper limit @xmath52 this limit is slightly better than the limit obtained from lunar - laser - ranging data ( mller _ et al .  _ 1996 ) and , more importantly , also holds for strong gravitational - field effects which could occur in the strong - field regions of neutron stars .",
    "due to its small eccentricity , @xmath53 ( 95% c.l . ) , and high velocity with respect to the cosmic microwave background ( @xmath54 km / s ) , psr j1012 + 5307 turns out to be the most important binary system for this kind of analysis ( lange _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep ) .",
    "while for psr j1012 + 5307 also the radial velocity of the system is known from spectroscopic observations of the white dwarf companion , for all the other binary pulsars no radial velocity information is available and we have to assume an isotropic probability distribution for the 3-d velocity .    in theories of gravity which violate the local lorentz invariance and the momentum conservation law , a rotating self - gravitating body will suffer a self - acceleration which is given by @xmath55 ( nordtvedt & will 1972 ) , where @xmath56 is a theory dependent parameter and @xmath57 denotes the rotational velocity of the body .",
    "again , binary pulsars are ideal probes for this kind of self - acceleration effects ( bell & damour 1996 ) . a careful analysis analogous to the previous analyses ( sep , local lorentz invariance ) gives @xmath58    note",
    ", the statistical tests for gravitational stark effects presented here for the first time appropriately take care of selection effects by simulating the whole population , therefore , giving the first reliable limits for @xmath43 , @xmath48 , and @xmath56 .",
    "i am grateful to kenneth nordtvedt for pointing out to me the problem of selection effects related with binary - pulsar limits to gravitational stark effects .",
    "i thank christoph lange for numerous valuable discussions ."
