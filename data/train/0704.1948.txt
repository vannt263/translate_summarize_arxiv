    "the second part of the @xmath1th hilbert problem asks for an upper bound to the number of limit cycles of a plane polynomial vector field of degree less or equal to @xmath2 . even in the case of quadratic systems ( @xmath3 )",
    "the problem remains open .",
    "an infinitesimal version of the @xmath1th hilbert problem can be formulated as follows :    _ find an upper bound @xmath4 to the number of limit cycles of a polynomial vector field of degree @xmath2 , close to a polynomial vector field with a first integral @xmath5_.    the associated foliation on the plane is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a given polynomial one - form , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is an integrating factor , and @xmath10 is a polynomial one - form of degree @xmath2 with coefficients depending analytically on the small parameter @xmath11 .",
    "a progress in solving the infinitesimal 16th hilbert problem is achieved mainly in the case when @xmath12 is a polynomial of degree three , or @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a polynomial of degree four see @xcite .",
    "a key point is that the generic leaves @xmath15 of the polynomial foliation @xmath16 are elliptic curves .",
    "we expect that the perturbations of more general polynomial foliations with elliptic leaves ( which we call `` elliptic foliations '' ) can be studied along the same lines .",
    "this leads naturally to the following ( open ) problem .",
    "_ for a given @xmath17 determine , up to an affine equivalence , the elliptic polynomial foliations @xmath18 , @xmath8",
    ". _    the present paper adresses the above problem in the quadratic case , @xmath3 . in view of applications to the @xmath1th hilbert problem most important",
    "is the case when the non - perturbed foliation is real and possesses a center .",
    "such foliations are well - known since dulac ( 1908 ) and kapteyn ( 1912 ) . moreover , when the leaves of the foliation ( the orbits of the quadratic vector field ) are algebraic curves",
    ", there is a ( rational ) first integral @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "reminding the classification of quadratic vector fields with a center , a rational first integral of the foliation induced is thus of four different kinds : @xmath19 \\ \\mbox{\\quad ( hamiltonian case)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\mbox{\\quad   ( reversible case)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath21\\\\ $ a$ , $ b$ , $ c$ \\ \\textrm{real numbers}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\mbox{(lotka - volterra case)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath22",
    "\\\\   p_2 \\in \\mathbb{r}_2[x , y]\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .   \\",
    "\\   \\mbox{(codimension $ 4 $ case)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in section [ section2 ] we give the classification , up to an affine equivalence , of all elliptic foliations with a first integral of the form ( [ rev ] ) or ( [ lv ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian cases obviously induce an elliptic foliation and have already been studied .",
    "remarks concerning the codimension @xmath23 case can be found in @xcite . in our classification , the base field is supposed to be @xmath24 , so all parameters @xmath25 are complex .",
    "we get a finite list of such foliations with a center as well several infinite series of degenerated foliations which can not have a center ( when the base field is @xmath26 ) .",
    "most of these elliptic foliations were not previously studied in the context of the 16th hilbert problem ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "+   + the section [ sec3 ] deals with the topology of the singular surface induced .",
    "an elliptic foliation in @xmath27 ( or more generally a foliation with an algebraic first integral @xmath5 ) gives rise canonically to an elliptic surface as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is chosen in such a way that the generic fiber of the map @xmath28 is an irreducible algebraic curve .",
    "the induced rational map @xmath29 have a finite number of points of indetermination .",
    "after a finite number of blow - ups of @xmath30 at these points we get ( by the hironaka s desingularisation theorem ) an induced analytic map @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a smooth complex surface .",
    "we may further suppose that @xmath32 is minimal in the sense that the fibers do not contain exceptional curves of first kind .",
    "the pair @xmath33 is then the elliptic surface associated to the elliptic foliation @xmath16 .",
    "it is unique up to a fiber preserving isomorphism . in this last section ,",
    "we compute the singular fibers of the elliptic surfaces obtained .",
    "the singular fibers of an elliptic surface are classified by kodaira @xcite .",
    "such computations are @xmath34-folds .",
    "first of all , it permits to identifiate isomorphic elliptic surfaces of non affine equivalent foliations , wich on its own is of interest .",
    "but the most important is that it immediately gives the local monodromy of the singular fibers . here",
    ", the number of singular fibers ( except in the hamiltonian case ) do not exceed @xmath23 so the local monodromy of the singular fibers gives a good description of the ( global ) monodromy group of the associated picard - fuchs equation ( or equivalently , the homological invariant of the surface @xcite ) , which on its turn is necessary when studying zeros of abelian integrals ( or limit cycles of the perturbed foliation ( [ perturbation ] ) ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath35 be a foliation on the plane @xmath27 defined by a differential form @xmath36 .",
    "we say that @xmath37 is _ elliptic _ provided that its generic leaves are elliptic curves .",
    "as stated in the introduction , in the present paper we suppose that @xmath38 has , eventually after an affine change of the variables in @xmath27 , a first integral of the form ( [ rev ] ) or ( [ lv ] ) . such a foliation will be called _ reversible _ ( having an integral of the form ( [ rev ] ) but not ( [ lv ] ) ) , of _ lotka - voltera type _ ( having an integral of the form ( [ lv ] ) but not ( [ rev ] ) ) , or of reversible lotka - voltera type .",
    "an elliptic foliation of lotka - voltera type has three invariant lines . from this",
    "we deduce that a reversible lotka - voltera foliation has always a first integral @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a polynomial of degree at most two , and the bi - variate polynomial @xmath41 is irreducible . in this section",
    "we prove the following :        * proof .",
    "* let @xmath47 be the set of @xmath48 such that for some determination of the multi - valued function @xmath49 holds @xmath50 . if the connected components of @xmath47 for all @xmath51 are algebraic curves , then @xmath52 and we put @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) with @xmath57.$ ]    as the foliation is reversible we may suppose that @xmath58 is irreducible , or simply @xmath59 .",
    "we shall suppose first that @xmath60 , that is to say the quadric @xmath61 is not tangent to the line at infinity in @xmath30 and to the line @xmath62 .              1 .   the case when @xmath70 +   + we obtain the hyper - elliptic curve @xmath71 .",
    "the roots of the polynomial @xmath72 are different and non zeros since @xmath51 is generic .",
    "consequently , its genus is one if and only if the degree of the polynomial is @xmath73 or @xmath23 and thus we get : 1 .",
    "@xmath74 2 .",
    "@xmath75 3 .",
    "@xmath76 4 .",
    "@xmath77 2 .",
    "suppose now @xmath78 +   + we easily have : @xmath79 thus after a birational transformation , we obtain : @xmath80 since @xmath51 is generic , all the roots of @xmath81 are different and do not vanish . *",
    "if @xmath82 is even we have : @xmath83 consequently , it is elliptic when @xmath84 either equal @xmath73 or @xmath23 .",
    "this gives the following curves : + 1 .",
    "@xmath85 2 .   @xmath86 * if @xmath82 is odd , then we have : @xmath87 since all the roots of @xmath81 are different and non zeros , the curve is elliptic if and only @xmath84 either equals @xmath34 or @xmath73 , which gives the solution @xmath88 above .",
    "this means that the quadric @xmath90 is tangent to the line @xmath62 and is transversal to the line at infinity , see figure [ example2 ] . after an affine transformation and scaling of @xmath51",
    "we get @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "therefore we need to compute the genus of @xmath93 for generic @xmath51 . +   + if @xmath94 the same computations as case @xmath95 give the same solutions of the problem .",
    "+ let @xmath96 and suppose that @xmath97 is even .",
    "we have @xmath98 , so if @xmath99 , it has genus one if and only @xmath100 or @xmath23 , hence @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "+ if @xmath103 the curve above is birational to the curve @xmath104 and so it has genus one if @xmath105 or @xmath23 which leads to @xmath106 + if @xmath107 , because @xmath82 is even and @xmath108 is odd , it is equivalent to calculate the genus of @xmath109 . therefore @xmath110 .",
    "+   + now suppose that @xmath111 is odd .",
    "the curve is birationally equivalent to @xmath112 .",
    "as above we get : @xmath113 , @xmath114,@xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118                this means that the quadric @xmath135 is tangent to the line at infinity and is transversal to the line @xmath62 . the birational change of variables @xmath136",
    ", @xmath137 shows that this is equivalent to the case @xmath138 and we get :              this means that the quadric @xmath61 is tangent to the line at infinity and to the line @xmath62 . up to affine change of re - scalings",
