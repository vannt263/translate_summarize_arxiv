    "these two scenarios are compared here . in particular , the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and effects of additional relativistic degrees of freedom are discussed .",

    "it is pointed out that if the sphalerons are in thermal equilibrium , then the @xmath0 sum is zero for left  handed fermions .",

    "the dirac neutrino is a four  component fermion and a definite lepton number can be assigned to its left and right  handed components .",

    "in addition , overall coefficients of expressions for the @xmath163 channel reduced cross section @xmath164 and reaction density @xmath165 are factor of two smaller than those in ( [ tplusu ] ) and ( [ tplusudensity ] ) .    for ratios of reaction densities to expansion rate of the universe",
    "we find @xmath166 and similar results for the neutral current .",
    "below the phase transition lepton number violating interactions are clearly too slow to affect the @xmath3 asymmetry generated at the gut scale , or , equivalently , to set the neutrino chemical potential to zero . therefore the light majorana neutrino can be assigned an effective chemical potential , and the rest of the analysis is the same as in the case of leptogenesis with dirac neutrino .",
    "baryon and lepton numbers are given by equations ( [ bandldirac ] ) , while electric charges of different species are given by equations ( [ chargesdirac ] ) .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite in the leptogenesis with majorana neutrino scenario the possibility that individual family lepton numbers are much larger than the total lepton number is naturaly realized for certain values of the cp violating phases .",
    "therefore , terms proportional to @xmath129 are likely to be important for calculation of the lepton and baryon asymmetries .",
    "in this paper lepton and baryon number asymmetries in two scenarios of leptogenesis have been considered .      despite the fact that a majorana fermion does not carry conserved quantum numbers and does not have a chemical potential , in the early universe",
    "the rate of the processes which bring number of neutrinos with different chirality to equilibrium is much smaller than expansion rate of the universe , and therefore the neutrino can be assigned an effective chemical potential .    in the scenario of leptogenesis with dirac neutrinos",
    "the smallness of the neutrino mass assures that lepton number asymmetries stored in the left and right  handed neutrinos do not equilibrate .",
    "the right  handed neutrinos carry only a small fraction of the universe energy density and have very little impact on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , constrained by the bbn .      above the phase transition baryon and",
    "lepton numbers are proportional to the _ total _ initial @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "number of the down quarks exceeds number of the up quarks and total electric charge of the leptons is positive .    below the phase transition due to the mass effects",
    "the final baryon number is nonzero even if the initial @xmath3 asymmetry is zero , provided that the individual lepton numbers @xmath120 are sufficiently large .",
    "as the oscillations equalize chemical potentials of the neutrinos long before the bbn epoch , this possibility is consistent with the bbn constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "if @xmath3 is large in comparison with @xmath129 then there is an excess of down quarks and total electric charge of the leptons is positive immediately after the phase transition . on the contrary ,",
    "if total @xmath3 is zero , there is an excess of up quarks and total charge of the leptons is negative .",
