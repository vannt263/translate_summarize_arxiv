    "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( hereafter , bcds ) have emerged as a particularly intriguing subset of dwarf galaxies that have been studied in the local universe ( z@xmath50.05 ) . since the early studies and characterizations by @xcite and @xcite , many investigations have classified bcds as systems that harbor spatially and temporally concentrated ongoing star formation in a low - mass galaxy potential well .",
    "while definitions in the literature vary , bcds are instrinsically faint systems ( m@xmath617 ) that exhibit ongoing star formation over the bulk of an otherwise physically compact stellar population .",
    "detailed studies of individual , nearby bcds have provided important insights into their physical properties and into the mechanisms that initiate and govern their star formation .",
    "@xcite found that five compact dwarf galaxies that are currently experiencing strong bursts of star formation exhibit central h  i  surface densities that are significantly higher than those of dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies .",
    "similarly , some well - studied bcds harbor very high column density neutral hydrogen gas in the regions of active star formation ( e.g. , n@xmath7 @xmath4 2.4@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 in izw18 ; see brown etal .",
    "2002 and van  zee etal .",
    "other recent studies have verified that many nearby and well - resolved systems have high neutral gas surface densities in the regions of ongoing star formation ( see , e.g. , thuan etal .",
    "2004 , elson etal .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .    the physical mechanism(s ) that create this central concentration of neutral gas remain(s ) ambiguous .",
    "one commonly proposed solution is that the current burst events in bcds are the result of a gravitational interaction with a nearby companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while there are examples of apparently interaction - driven burst events ( e.g. , the sbs1129@xmath11576 system studied by ekta etal .",
    "2006 ) , there are also systems that have been shown to be quite isolated ( see , for example , van  zee etal .  1998 , bureau etal .  1999 , and further discussion below ) .",
    "while undiscovered , very low - mass companions may reside near some of these isolated systems ( consider , for example , the discovery of an interaction with a low surface brightness companion to the magellanic irregular ngc4449 by martnez - delgado etal .",
    "2012 ) , the gravitational interaction trigger does not appear to be universal in bcd galaxies .",
    "the origin of the concentrated star formation in at least some of the isolated bcds appears to require a different initiation mechanism .    while the properties of isolated bcds have been studied in some detail ( e.g. , the studies of ngc2915 by meurer etal .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) , a particularly intriguing system was discovered in the _ arecibo dual beam survey _ ( adbs ) by @xcite : adbs113845 + 2008 .",
    "this galaxy was subsequently cataloged as a uv - excess source in the 2nd kiso survey ( miyauchi - isobe & maehara , 2000 ) .",
    "its extremely compact nature was first recognized during _ wiyn _ 0.9-meter broadband imaging of selected adbs galaxies .",
    "the optical component was found to be extremely compact ( b - band exponential scale length @xmath20.57 kpc ) ; h@xmath1  narrowband imaging confirmed a high ongoing star formation rate ( 0.06 m@xmath12yr@xmath3 ) within this optically compact stellar component .",
    "subsequent _ very large array _",
    "( _ vla _ ) h  i  spectral line imaging of the source revealed that the neutral gas disk was extremely extended compared to the compact optical structure .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , h  i  gas was detected to a maximum radial distance of @xmath1325 kpc at the 10@xmath14 @xmath10 level ; it thus possesses one of the largest h  i - to - optical size ratios of any known dwarf galaxy .",
    "in contrast to some detailed h  i  studies of other bcd systems that have found complex velocity structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , adbs113845 + 2008  is undergoing well - ordered rotation throughout most of the neutral gas disk .",
    "perhaps the most mysterious quality of adbs113845 + 2008  is that its neutral gas morphology is dominated by a broken ring structure that is roughly 15 kpc in diameter .",
    "this ring contains the highest column density neutral gas in the galaxy and is not coincident with the optical component .",
    "rather , the star - forming component resides in a relative h  i  under - density .",
    "@xcite interpret this result to be a signature of an extremely inefficient mode of star formation in a very isolated galaxy .",
    "we hereafter refer to this striking collection of physical properties as the `` giant disk '' phenomenon in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the remarkable characteristics of adbs113845 + 2008  are the origin of the present investigation .",
    "stated most simply , we seek to understand if this `` giant disk '' scenario is common or rare in star - forming dwarf galaxies that have stellar components that are as strongly centrally concentrated as the one in adbs113845 + 2008 . to this end",
    ", we present new optical , infrared , and h  i  imaging of a sample of extremely optically compact dwarf galaxies . the new observations presented here confirm the rarity of the `` giant disk '' found in the adbs113845 + 2008  system .",
    "the sample of optically compact galaxies studied in this paper was produced using specific selection criteria designed to identify star - forming galaxies with compact stellar components ; adbs113845 + 2008  and ic2271 were already known to have such characteristics from previous imaging . starting with the full _ kpno international spectroscopic survey _",
    "( _ kiss _ , an objective - prism survey for extragalactic emission - line objects ; salzer etal .  2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) database , we searched for emission - line objects that were spectroscopically - confirmed . to maximize physical resolution",
    "an upper velocity constraint was set at v@xmath15 @xmath16 5,000 kms@xmath3 .",
    "photometric parameters were obtained for these objects from the _ sdss _ using the _ skytools _ interface .",
    "objects with optical radii less than 3  were selected ; these were then individually inspected to ensure a compact optical structure . finally , we searched for archival single - dish h  i  observations of these remaining systems in order to determine their suitability for _ vla _ observing .",
    "this resulted in a sample of six galaxies selected from the _ kiss _ catalogs .",
    "we stress that this sample is meant to be representative of the compact dwarf class , but it is not complete in the sense of being a volume - limited sample of such sources .",
    "all of these galaxies share the following characteristics : 1 ) optical compactness ( optical radii at 50% peak brightness of @xmath51 kpc ) ; 2 ) faint blue absolute magnitudes ( m@xmath1717 ) ; 3 ) ongoing star formation ( based on emission - line selection by the h@xmath1  or [ ] lines ) ; and 4 ) proximity for spatially resolved work with the _ vla _ c - array ( 15  beam @xmath55 kpc for all systems ; mean velocity @xmath2 3315 kms@xmath3 @xmath4 45 mpc ) .",
    "note that in the work of @xcite , adbs113845 + 2008  was selected using these same criteria .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the six _ kiss _ galaxies in the present study ( see table  [ t1 ] for salient properties ) were selected based on their optical properties alone ; the h  i  flux integrals were used only to determine observational feasibility .",
    "h  i  spectral line imaging of each of the sample galaxies was obtained with the _ vla _ in the c configuration via observing programs ac 841 and ac 919 ( pi : cannon ) .",
    "the _ vla _",
    "correlator was used in a standard single polarization mode , providing 64 or 128 channels over a 1.56 or 3.12 mhz bandwidth . the velocity resolution ( 2.56 , 5.15 , or 10.3 kms@xmath3ch@xmath3 )",
    "was selected based on the ( single dish ) line width of each source .",
    "combinations of bandwidth and frequency resolution were selected to guarantee sufficient line - free channels to allow an accurate removal of the continuum emission .",
    "table  [ t2 ] provides details about each observing session from which data are presented in this work .",
    "all reductions were performed using the astronomical image processing ( aips ) package .",
    "due to the array being in a `` hybrid '' state , containing both _",
    "vla _ and _ evla _ receivers , standard reduction procedures were followed with necessary modifications to account for the `` aliasing '' effect that arose due to the digital - to - analog conversion required to correlate _ evla _ signals using the old _ vla _ correlator .",
    "this effect was most egregious for narrow bandwidth observations .",
    "we thus followed the nrao instructions of flagging _",
    "baselines before and unflagging them after the tasks bpass and calib .",
    "the resulting continuum subtraction was performed using a first - order fit in uvlsf to channels where the bandpass was demonstrably flat .",
    "we found no measurable differences between this calibration approach and one where we disregarded the _ evla _ antennas completely and followed standard reduction procedures .",
    "we note that there were only 5 _ evla _ antennas in the array during the c configuration observation of adbs113845 + 2008  ( which would contain the most measurable aliasing effect , given the bandwidths listed in table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "two data cubes were produced for each galaxy using the task imagr and each one was cleaned to 2 times the rms noise ( hgbom 1974 ; clark 1980 ) . first , `` low - resolution '' cubes were created using natural weighting ( robust = 5 in the aips imagr task ) .",
    "these cubes were convolved to a circular beam size of 20  x 20 .",
    "second , `` high - resolution '' cubes were created using robust weighting ( robust = 0.5 ; see briggs 1995 ) .",
    "these cubes were convolved to a circular beam size of 15  x 15 .    to create blanked cubes and moment maps ,",
    "the naturally weighted cubes were convolved to a beam size of 30 .",
    "these cubes were blanked at the 2 @xmath18 level found in line - free channels .",
    "the cubes were then inspected by hand , and emission in three or more consecutive channels was considered to be real .",
    "these cubes were then used to blank both the `` low- '' ( 20 ) and `` high - resolution '' ( 15 ) cubes . through this procedure , we assure that the same pixels contribute to both the `` low- '' and the `` high - resolution '' cubes .",
    "moment maps showing integrated h  i  emission and velocity structures were created using the techniques discussed in detail in @xcite .    as seen in table  [ t3 ] ,",
    "the total h  i  flux integrals derived for the sample galaxies are each lower than the _ arecibo observatory _ single dish observations @xcite .",
    "the cause of these differences is at least partly due to the missing short _ uv _ spacings of the _ vla _ compared to a single dish measurement .",
    "for example , the observed h  i  flux integral of ic2271 of 1.22 jy kms@xmath3 is significantly lower than the value found by @xcite using the _ vla _ d array ( 4.7 jy kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "similarly , the total h  i  flux integral derived for adbs113845 + 2008  ( 1.58 jy kms@xmath3 ) is lower than the 2.58 jy kms@xmath3 found by @xcite using combined c and d configuration data .",
    "a re - reduction of the d configuration data sets as part of the present analysis confirms a higher flux integral using the more compact configuration ( s@xmath7 = 2.12@xmath190.21 jykms@xmath3 for adbs 113845 + 2008 and s@xmath7 = 1.61@xmath190.16 jykms@xmath3 for ic 2271 , both with 55  circular beam sizes ) .",
    "since the kissr galaxies ( which constitute the bulk of the present sample ) have only c configuration observations , we chose to intentionally omit the d configuration data for ic2271 and adbs113845 + 2008  from the present analysis ; this assures that all eight galaxies have similar thresholds for surface brightness sensitivity at different spatial scales .    in an effort to recover as much flux from each of the target galaxies as possible , we performed various tests with the _ vla _ _ uv _ datasets .",
    "long baselines were downweighted in imagr via tapering in the _ uv _ plane .",
    "circular beam size cubes with resolution elements of 15 , 30 , and 60  were created for each galaxy using appropriate uvtaper values .",
    "the results of these tests are summarized in table  [ t4 ] .",
    "there are only modest gains in the recovered flux integrals for most sources .",
    "kissr278 shows the most pronounced increase in s@xmath7 when moving from 15  to 30  resolution .",
    "note that ic2271 and adbs113845 + 2008 , which have the largest single dish flux integrals ( see table  [ t3 ] ) , show only modest increases in s@xmath7 when downweighting long baselines .",
    "this is strong evidence that the missing shortest spacing baselines are important for the recovery of all of the h  i  flux from these systems",
    ".    we also experimented with calibrating our _ uv _ data using only certain baselines in the array .",
    "using kissr561 as a template , we independently calibrated the _",
    "uv _ data in five different ways : by removing the _ vla_-_evla _ baselines ; by removing the _ vla_-_vla _ baselines ; by retaining only the _ evla_- _ evla _ baselines ; by retaining only the _ vla_-_vla _ baselines ; and by the previously discussed method in which the _ evla_-_evla _ baselines were flagged and unflagged around specific tasks .",
    "we find no significant differences in the galaxy s morphology amongst these tests .",
    "the last method ( i.e. , the flagging and unflagging of _ evla_-_evla _ baselines ) proved to recover the most flux , and so was used for all datasets in the sample .    as we discuss in detail in ",
    "[ s3.2 ] below , five of the eight sample galaxies have nearby companions , some of which are very h  i - bright .",
    "a third possible explanation for the lower flux integrals derived for some of the systems studied here is that these high - surface - brightness companions introduce sidelobes , the imperfect cleaning of which will prevent a full recovery of the flux integral from the dim target galaxies .",
    "in fact , this effect can lead to the single dish flux measurements being erroneously high .",
    "the system that is most egregiously affected in this way is kissr396 ; as we discuss below , this source is a companion to the massive spiral ngc5375 .",
    "it is possible that the single dish measurement of kissr396 is an over - estimate , since ngc5375 is in the first sidelobe of the single - dish primary beam . in an attempt to image this complex field with high fidelity",
    ", we implemented cleaning algorithms using both multi - faceted cleans around the detected galaxies and multi - scale clean algorithms @xcite . neither approach produced significant increases in the flux integral recovered from kissr396 .",
    "we thus use the _ vla _ s@xmath7 values quoted in table  [ t3 ] throughout the remainder of this work .",
    "optical and infrared imaging of the sample galaxies was obtained from public archival databases to facilitate detailed comparisons with the h  i  imaging presented here .",
    "this was necessary because the imaging data obtained as part of _ kiss _",
    "@xcite had an image scale of 2.0pixel@xmath3 ; none of the _ kiss _ galaxies studied here are resolved in the survey data .",
    "optical r - band images were obtained from the _ sdss _ data release eight @xcite . 3.6 @xmath20 m and 4.5 @xmath20 m",
    "_ spitzer _ images of the six kissr galaxies were obtained from the _ spitzer heritage archive _ ( _ spitzer _ imaging of ic2271 and adbs113845 + 2008  is not available ) .",
    "no further treatments of the pipeline - processed archival data were required .",
    "these images are discussed in further detail in the sections below .    throughout this paper",
    "we will discuss the physical sizes of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "we thus draw specific attention to the angular resolution of the optical and infrared imaging used in our analysis .",
    "the fwhm of the _",
    "spitzer_/irac images is 1.66  at 3.6 @xmath20 m and 1.72  at 4.5 @xmath20 m .",
    "similarly , the median psf fwhm of _ sdss _ r - band images is quoted as 1.3 , and we adopt this value here ; using the individual images we analyze in this work , we measure empirical psf fwhm values ranging from 0.94  ( ic2271 ) to 1.22  ( kissr245 ) .",
    "using the blanked datacubes discussed in ",
    "[ s2.2 ] , real emission in each channel was summed in order to create the global h  i  profiles shown in figures  [ figcap1 ] and [ figcap2 ] .",
    "it is immediately evident that the neutral gas disks of the sample galaxies span a wide range of physical characteristics .",
    "two systems show broad h  i  profiles ( @xmath21v @xmath22100 kms@xmath3 ) that are indicative of bulk rotation ( e.g , adbs113845 + 2008 , kissr561 ) .",
    "three systems show what may be double - horned or broad profiles that are measured with poor fidelity ( e.g. , kissr245 , kissr396 , kissr1021 ) .",
    "three systems show simple single - peak profiles indicative of either low rotation velocities or nearly face - on inclination angles ( e.g , ic2271 , kissr278 , kissr572 ) .",
    "the profiles shown in figures  [ figcap1 ] and [ figcap2 ] should be compared with the recovered flux integrals presented in table  [ t3 ] and discussed in ",
    "the three systems with the smallest recovered s@xmath7 values in table  [ t3 ] ( kissr278 , kissr396 , kissr572 ) are those systems with the narrowest h  i  profiles . note specifically that kissr278 , kissr396 , and kissr572 are each only detected in 4 , 7 , and 3 consecutive channels of their datacubes , respectively .",
    "it is important to keep the low signal to noise ratio of some of these galaxies in mind during the discussion that follows .",
    "single dish profiles of the six kissr galaxies in figures  [ figcap1 ] and [ figcap2 ] were presented in @xcite .",
    "a comparison of these two sets of profiles shows similar morphologies in some cases ; the profiles of kissr278 , kissr396 , and kissr561 shown in figures  [ figcap1 ] and [ figcap2 ] are similar in shape as those shown in @xcite , although with slightly weaker peak flux densities in the interferometric global profiles .",
    "conversely , the other three kissr systems ( kissr245 , kissr572 , and kissr1021 ) show significant differences in the shapes of their profiles ; the single - dish profiles not only recover more flux ( see detailed discussion in   [ s2.2 ] above ) , but they also recover different morphologies ( note , for example , that the single dish profile of kissr1021 shows a pronounced double - horn morphology that is only poorly recovered in the interferometric global profile ) .",
    "figures  [ figcap3 ] through [ figcap10 ] compare the h  i , optical , and infrared ( available for six of the eight systems , excluding ic2271 and adbs113845 + 2008 ) images of the eight sample galaxies . using the 2 kpc physical length denoted in panel ( b ) of each figure",
    ", it is immediately evident that the high surface brightness stellar component of each of these eight galaxies is extremely compact .",
    "in fact , some of these galaxies are only slightly more extended than foreground stars found in the fields [ note the close proximity of foreground stars to adbs113845 + 2008  ( figure  [ figcap4 ] ) and kissr561 ( figure  [ figcap8 ] ) ] ; we discuss the effects of resolution on our results in more detail below . while the h  i  surface brightness varies from one system to the next , each of these eight galaxies is detected at high significance in both the _ sdss _ and in the _ spitzer _ images .",
    "an examination of the h  i  column density images and contours in figures  [ figcap3 ] through [ figcap10 ] reveals that all of the galaxies in this sample , with the exception of adbs113845 + 2008 , harbor centrally concentrated neutral gas distributions at these spatial resolutions . in most cases",
    "the optical and infrared surface brightness maxima are spatially coincident with the highest detected column density region ( e.g. , ic2271 in figure  [ figcap3 ] , kissr572 in figure  [ figcap9 ] ) ; in some systems there is a small offset between these two maxima , but most of these offsets are smaller than the synthesized beam sizes and are thus not significant .",
    "the most significant discrepancy between the stellar and gaseous components is found in adbs113845 + 2008 : as discussed in detail in @xcite , the h  i  morphology is dominated by a broken ring structure that surrounds the optical body of the system .",
    "the stellar component is many kpc away from the highest column density neutral gas .",
    "similarly , an examination of the optical and infrared images of these sources reveals that most members of the sample are extremely compact .",
    "however , it is important to stress that each of the systems is spatially resolved in the _ sdss _ images , the _ spitzer _ images , or both ; we discuss this in more detail in   [ s4.1 ] below .",
    "a few of the galaxies do have low surface brightness emission in the optical and infrared that may be indicative of the compact burst being only the highest surface brightness component of a larger stellar disk .",
    "the most obvious systems with these properties are kissr278 ( figure  [ figcap6 ] ) , kissr561 ( figure  [ figcap8 ] , but note that the compact and high surface brightness object in the northern part of the stellar disk is a foreground star ) , and kissr572 ( figure  [ figcap9 ] ) .",
    "the images shown in figures  [ figcap3 ] through [ figcap10 ] reveal that five of the eight neutral gas disks extend well beyond the beam size at this sensitivity level ; the h  i  disks of kissr278 , kissr396 , and kissr572 are the same size as the beam .",
    "there are low surface brightness extensions of h  i  gas in some systems : ic2271 ( figure  [ figcap3 ] ) and kissr1021 ( figure  [ figcap10 ] ) harbor h  i  disks that are roughly twice the size of the stellar body ; kissr245 ( figure  [ figcap5 ] ) and kissr561 ( figure  [ figcap8 ] ) show tenuous h  i  filaments extending toward the southwest . however , the low signal to noise ratio of most of these datasets ( see discussion in   [ s2 ] ) precludes a robust kinematic study of seven of the eight systems in this work .",
    "the detailed dynamical analysis of adbs113845 + 2008  is already presented in @xcite , to which we refer the interested reader for details and results .",
    "while dynamical analyses are not possible with most of the data presented here , the derived surface densities are robustly measured ( at this modest sensitivity level )",
    ". stated differently , an analysis of the ( projected ) surface densities in each system does not require a detailed knowledge of the gas dynamics .",
    "we thus limit our interpretation to those qualities and quantities of the neutral gas that do not depend on dynamical properties .",
    "we focus on quantifying the relative sizes of the neutral gas and stellar disks , as a measure of the frequency of the `` giant disk '' phenomenon ; most of   [ s4 ] is devoted to addressing this science goal .",
    "one such well - studied metric is the empirical relationship between h  i  column density and ongoing star formation . while we do not have h@xmath1 imaging of all of these sources ,",
    "each is a spectroscopically confirmed emission line source from kiss @xcite .",
    "we make the implicit assumption that the majority of the ongoing star formation in these systems is spatially coincident with the high surface brightness stellar components shown in the optical images in figures  [ figcap3 ] through [ figcap10 ] .",
    "we note explicitly that the most extreme member of this sample , adbs113845 + 2008 , has an h@xmath1 morphology that is essentially indistinguishable from that of the r - band image shown in figure  [ figcap4 ] ( see , e.g. , figure 5 of cannon etal .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "a gas column density of 10@xmath23 @xmath10 has been shown to trace locations of active star formation ( e.g. , skillman 1987 ; kennicutt 1989 ; kennicutt 1998 ; and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , in all of the galaxies , except ic 2271 and kissr561 , the peak observed h  i  column densities are below this 10@xmath23 @xmath10 level , even when the h  i  column density and stellar surface brightness maxima are spatially coincident .",
    "this is consistent with the results of other studies of dirr systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note that beam smearing may be removing the signatures of high column density gas at our current resolutions of 15  and 20 , so we are cautious not to over - interpret this signature at the present time .",
    "higher resolution and sensitivity observations of these galaxies , while requiring extensive amounts of additional observing time , would be very insightful in revealing the small - scale structure of the neutral gas disks .",
    "the enigmatic properties of adbs113845 + 2008  led @xcite to argue for an evolutionary scenario where isolation allows for a very inefficient mode of star formation or , alternatively , very inefficient gas consumption .",
    "one might naively expect that systems with similar optical properties might also be similarly isolated .",
    "we were thus somewhat surprised to discover that the majority of the sample members ( five of eight systems ) are in relative physical proximity to other galaxies ; we hereafter refer to these systems as loose associations .",
    "h  i  and optical images of these loose associations are shown in figure  [ figcap11 ] ( ic 2271 ) , figure  [ figcap12 ] ( kissr245 ) , figure  [ figcap13 ] ( kissr396 ) , figure  [ figcap14 ] ( kissr561 ) , and figure  [ figcap15 ] ( kissr572 ) . using the 10 kpc physical length denoted in panel ( b ) of each of these figures , one can discern the ( projected ) separation of the galaxies in each loose association .",
    "we draw attention to the ( projected ) separation of each association member from the compact dwarf system studied here in the caption of each figure and in table  [ t5 ] ; the minimum and maximum separations are 26 kpc ( ic2271 and sdssj081808.31 + 243006.4 ) and 230 kpc ( kissr572 and sdss j144754.68 + 291929.4 ) .",
    "a commonly posited mechanism to initiate a burst of star formation ( i.e. , a starburst ) is a tidal interaction .",
    "dynamical instabilities can drive gas deep into the potential well , initiating spatially and temporally concentrated star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while a direct signature of a tidally triggered star formation event has been difficult to produce observationally , one might suspect that extended neutral gas in the form of tidal tails might be considered to be an indirect signature of interaction - driven evolution ( e.g. , the extended tidal structure in the m81 group of galaxies ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to search for such signs of interactions amongst the loose associations studied here , we examined the moment zero ( integrated h  i  intensity ) maps and full datacubes at a variety of spatial resolutions ( from 15  to 60 ) for signatures of tidal material between the compact dwarf systems and other association members .",
    "some systems have asymmetric , low surface brightness extensions of h  i  gas away from the central disk ( see discussion of ic2271 , kissr1021 , kissr245 , and kissr561 above ) that can be interpreted as weak evidence for gravitational interactions playing a role in their recent evolution . none of the loose associations shown in figures  [ figcap11 ] through [ figcap15 ] show direct evidence of strong tidal interaction in the form of tails or diffuse gas ( at the n@xmath7 @xmath22 10@xmath14 @xmath10 level ) connecting one system to another .",
    "the most promising candidate for a strong interaction scenario might be the loose association containing ic2271 ; there is some low surface brightness h  i  gas surrounding multiple galaxies in this field . given the lack of very short _ uv _ spacings in the data presented here ,",
    "the surface brightness sensitivity to large - scale structure in these images is only modest .",
    "we conclude that the membership of the majority of these star - forming systems in loose associations is intriguing but weak evidence for tidally triggered star formation events ; very deep observations of these systems with the compact _ vla _ d configuration could be very fruitful in further quantifying the role of interactions in initiating starburst events .",
    "the primary goal of the present investigation is to quantify the relative sizes of the neutral gas and stellar disks of each of the optically compact dwarf galaxies in our sample , thus estimating the frequency of the `` giant disk '' phenomenon exemplified by adbs113845 + 2008  and discussed in detail in @xcite . to make this comparison ,",
    "we create radially averaged surface brightness profiles of each system in the optical , infrared , and h  i  spectral line .",
    "we measure the exponential scale lengths at optical and infrared wavelengths , and compare these to both the exponential scale length of the neutral gas disks ( when possible ) and to the sizes of the gaseous disks at the 10@xmath14 @xmath10 level .",
    "it is important to emphasize that while this comparison does not include dynamical parameters for each system ( e.g. , an inclination derived from dynamical modeling of an individual galaxy s velocity field ) , the comparisons discussed below do use the same corrections ( when applicable ) for galaxy inclination at each wavelength .",
    "similarly , our analysis uses matched apertures between wavelengths to assure self - similar measurements .",
    "we define a galaxy as being `` resolved '' in a certain image if the derived scale length or size exceeds the fwhm or beam size .",
    "therefore , we classify systems as `` resolved '' in the _ sdss _ r - band , the _",

    "similarly , we classify systems as `` resolved '' in h  i  if the size of the h  i  disk at the 10@xmath14 @xmath10 column density level exceeds the 15  beam size .",
    "we discuss the details of each of these metrics in the subsections that follow .",
    "optical and infrared surface brightness profiles for each of the galaxies were produced by fitting elliptical isophotes to the _ sdss _ r - band , _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath20 m , and _ spitzer _",
    "4.5 @xmath20 m images using the iraf task ellipse .",
    "as noted above , some of these systems have easily identifiable foreground stars that can contaminate the surface brightness profiles [ e.g. , adbs113845 + 2008  ( figure  [ figcap4 ] ) and kissr561 ( figure  [ figcap8 ] ) ] .",
    "such foreground objects were masked by hand using the iraf task fixpix .",
    "for each system , the position angle and inclination were determined from the _ sdss _ r - band image .",
    "when a system was extended in one dimension , the position angle was defined as that angle east of north that aligns with the larger projected optical axis .",
    "the inclination was defined by @xmath24 where _ a _ and _ b _ are the major and minor axes , respectively .",
    "the ellipse parameters used to derive the isophotal photometry are given in table  [ t6 ] .",
    "surface photometry was measured in elliptical isophotes incremented in one - pixel steps along the major axis ( 0.4  per ellipse for the _ sdss _ images and 0.6  per ellipse for the _ spitzer _ images ) .",
    "the r - band ellipses are shown in red in figures  [ figcap3 ] though [ figcap10 ] , while the infrared ellipses are shown in green in figures  [ figcap5 ] though [ figcap10 ] .",

    "based on the selection criteria used to create the sample ( two of which were an optical radius less than 3  and an upper limit to the recessional velocity or distance ; see discussion in   [ s2 ] above ) , the profiles are all centrally peaked and show little structure throughout the optical disks of the galaxies . while there is some variation in the steepness of the profile in the inner regions of the systems ( i.e. , within the inner few arcseconds )",
    ", it is immediately obvious that each system harbors an exceptionally compact stellar component .    to quantify the sizes of these compact stellar populations , we next derived the scale lengths of each system in the _ sdss _ r - band and in the _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath20 m and 4.5 @xmath20 m bands . in deriving these profiles",

    ", a very good approximation for the exponential disk component of the optical radial profile can be made using : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the central surface brightness in units of mag arcsec@xmath25 , _ r _ is the radius , @xmath28 is the surface brightness in units of mag arcsec@xmath25 as a function of radius , and _ h _ is the scale length .",
    "table  [ t7 ] provides the calculated scale lengths ( in both angular and in physical units ) at each wavelength , derived from the profiles shown in figures  [ figcap16 ] and [ figcap17 ] , with upper limit errors of 25% at each ellipse location .",

    "3.6 @xmath20 m band , and the _ spitzer _ 4.5 @xmath20 m band , respectively .",
    "the scale lengths presented in table  [ t7 ] show that all of the galaxies are resolved in at least one optical or infrared image , and that most are resolved in both .",
    "recall that the fwhm of the _ sdss _ r - band , _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath20 m , and _",
    "4.5 @xmath20 m images are 1.3 , 1.66 , and 1.72 , respectively .",
    "values in table  [ t7 ] show that all systems except for kissr245 are resolved in the _ sdss _ images ( that is , _ h_@xmath29  exceeds the 1.3  fwhm of the _ sdss _ r - band images ) .",
    "h_@xmath29  value for kissr245 is formally smaller than the fwhm , although it is consistent within the errorbar .",
    "similarly , _ spitzer _ resolves each galaxy ; note , however , that the scale lengths of kissr245 at 3.6 @xmath20 m and of kissr1021 at 4.5 @xmath20 m are consistent with the fwhm , given the errorbars .",
    "the optical and infrared scale lengths in table  [ t7 ] quantify the sizes of the compact stellar components of the sample galaxies . at the adopted distances , the stellar component of each system",

    "moving to the infrared , the scale lengths increase .",
    "this is exactly the behavior expected of an older and non - star forming stellar population .",
    "while each of the infrared scale lengths exceeds the r - band value , it is remarkable to note that each system is still exceptionally compact even when considering the older stellar populations .",
    "for example , at 4.5 @xmath20 m , some systems have scale lengths slightly larger than 1 kpc ( kissr278 , kissr561 , kissr572 ) , but others show very little increase in scale length with increasing wavelength ( consider kissr1021 , whose scale length does not change between the optical and the infrared , within the measurement errors ) .      having quantitatively established the compact nature of the stellar population of each of the sample galaxies , we now seek to quantify the sizes of the h  i  neutral gas disks via two methods .",
    "first , we derive radially averaged surface brightness profiles for each system ; when possible , we use these profiles to derive an exponential scale length .",
    "second , we quantify the size of the disks at the 10@xmath14 @xmath10 levels . we discuss each method in detail below .",
    "we begin by creating radial h  i  surface brightness profiles for each of the galaxies using the 15  beam images and the gipsy task ellint . as an inspection of figures  [ figcap3 ] through [ figcap10 ] shows ,",
    "the neutral gas disks studied here are larger than the beam size for five of the eight galaxies ( excluding kissr278 , kissr396 , and kissr572 ) .",
    "a detailed dynamical analysis is only possible for adbs113845 + 2008 ; this precludes the derivation of kinematic position angles and inclinations for most galaxies . in order to assure an accurate comparison of stellar and gaseous properties , we thus use the same position angles and inclinations as derived using the _ sdss _ r - band images ( see table  [ t6 ] and the detailed discussion in   [ s4.1 ] above ) .",
    "these ellipses are shown in blue in figures  [ figcap3 ] through [ figcap10 ] .",
    "a semi - major axis and step size of 5  was used to create each of the h  i  profiles ; technically this means that the profiles we discuss below are oversampled ( compared to the 15  beam size ) by a factor of 3 .",
    "however , this oversampling does allow us to extract meaningful radially averaged surface brightness profiles .",
    "figures 18 and 19 show these surface brightness profiles for each of the eight sample galaxies . as was evident from the surface density images presented in   [ s3.1 ] ,",
    "most of the sample galaxies have h  i  surface brightness profiles that are centrally peaked at the resolution of these observations and that fall off with radius in a more or less smooth way .",
    "note that low surface brightness features in some of the galaxies moment zero ( integrated h  i  intensity ) maps do cause departures from smooth profiles in the outer disks ; for example , the low surface brightness feature extending to the southwest of kissr245 in figure  [ figcap5 ] is easily identified as the slight increase in h  i  surface density between @xmath1325  and @xmath1350  in figure  [ figcap18 ] .    the obvious exception to this trend is adbs113845 + 2008 , whose radially averaged h  i  surface density profile ( created with the optically derived inclination and position angle discussed above , and shown in red in figure  [ figcap18 ] ) rises with increasing galactocentric radius , peaks , and then falls off in the outer disk .",
    "the peak surface densities are located in the broken ring structure @xmath137.5 kpc from the stellar component .",
    "a cursory comparison of the profiles in figures  [ figcap18 ] and [ figcap19 ] already reveals the striking differences between adbs113845 + 2008  and the other compact dwarf galaxies in the present sample ; we discuss these differences in more detail below , and refer the interested reader to @xcite for a more complete discussion of the remarkable characteristics of the adbs113845 + 2008  system .",
    "the radial profiles shown in figures  [ figcap18 ] and [ figcap19 ] ( specifically , the red profile for adbs 113845 + 2008 ) were created using exactly the same inclinations and position angles as used to derive the optical and infrared surface brightness profiles in figures  [ figcap16 ] and [ figcap17 ] . using these neutral gas radial profiles , exponential fits were made using a version of equation  [ eq1 ] converted to linear units : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the central surface brightness of the disk in m@xmath12  pc@xmath25 , _ r _ is the radius , @xmath35 is the surface brightness of the disk in m@xmath12  pc@xmath25 as a function of radius , and _",
    "h _ is the scale length @xcite .",
    "we hereafter refer to the h  i  scale length derived using this equation as _ h_@xmath7 .",

    "values in table  [ t7 ] . for all of the systems except adbs113845 + 2008 ,",
    "the calculated values of _",
    "h_@xmath7  are smaller than the beam size .",
    "formally , this metric to measure the size of the h  i  disks only provides meaningful results when it can be fit over multiple independent beams .",
    "as noted above , our radially averaged profiles required over - sampling by a factor of three . while the sizes of the h  i  disks based on the _ h_@xmath7  metric are interesting , and we discuss these briefly below , we seek an alternative measure of the size of the neutral gas disks of these galaxies .",
    "it is obvious from the neutral gas morphology ( figure  [ figcap3 ] ) and surface brightness profile ( figure  [ figcap18 ] ) of adbs113845 + 2008  that an exponential scale length is undefined for a disk whose morphology is not centrally concentrated . while we considered fitting the outer disk of adbs113845 + 2008  ( i.e. , that region at radii larger than that of the broken h  i  ring ) with an exponential function , the striking disparity between the neutral gas and stellar disks of this system warrants caution against such an approach . due to the remarkable qualities of this galaxy s neutral gas disk",
    ", we thus do not calculate an exponential h  i  scale length .",
    "the properties of adbs113845 + 2008  naturally require a second metric for the size of the neutral gas disks of these systems .    to address these issues",
    ", we thus use the radially averaged h  i  surface density profiles in figures  [ figcap18 ] and [ figcap19 ] to determine the ( radially averaged ) size of the h  i  disk at the 10@xmath14 @xmath10 column density level .",
    "this column density corresponds to a mass surface density of 0.08 m@xmath12  pc@xmath25 ; recall from the discussion in   [ s2.2 ] that this emission is above the 2@xmath18 level in at least 3 consecutive channels .",
    "we extract the radii of the sample galaxies at this level ( hereafter referred to as r@xmath7 ) from figures  [ figcap18 ] and [ figcap19 ] and tabulate the values in table  [ t7 ] ; note that @xcite quantified the physical size of the adbs113845 + 2008  disk in the same manner . as expected , r@xmath7",
    "h_@xmath7  in all systems where both quantities are defined .",
    "it is important to stress that for kissr245 , kissr278 , kissr396 , and kissr572 , r@xmath7  is equal ( within errors ) to the beam size ; this means that the r@xmath7  metric for these galaxies is formally an upper limit ( but note that kissr245 does have h  i  gas extending to the southwest , well beyond a single beam size ) .",
    "these four systems are `` unresolved '' by the present observations ( that is , r@xmath7  @xmath5 beam size , thus the r@xmath7  and related values being listed as upper limits in tables  [ t7 ] and [ t8 ] ) ; they may harbor smaller neutral gas components than calculated here .",
    "we discuss the ratios of both _",
    "h_@xmath7/_h_@xmath29  and r@xmath7/_h_@xmath29  for all eight sample galaxies in   [ s4.3 ] .",
    "we again note that no kinematic constraints are used to derive the scale lengths or disk sizes discussed here ; the profiles shown in figures  [ figcap16 ] through [ figcap19 ] use only optically - derived position angles and inclinations . since seven of the eight galaxies",
    "are not sufficiently resolved to undertake a robust dynamical analysis , we can only test these dependences for the one system that does have a full kinematic model , adbs113845 + 2008 . to test how using the position angles and inclinations derived from the optical images affect our calculations ( as opposed to using those derived from the h  i  dynamics ) , we show three radial mass surface density profiles for adbs113845 + 2008  in figure  [ figcap18 ] .",
    "the red profile is derived using the optical inclination ( 0@xmath37 ) and position angle ( 0@xmath37 ) and is discussed above .",
    "the blue profile uses the dynamically - derived position angle ( 155@xmath37 ) and inclination ( 30@xmath37 ) from @xcite .",
    "the green profile uses the same position angle ( 155@xmath37 ) as in @xcite , but assumes a larger value for the galaxy s inclination angle ( 60@xmath37 ) . since _",
    "h_@xmath7  is undefined for adbs113845 + 2008 , it is difficult to use this test to assess the dependence of h  i  scale length on inclination or position angle .",
    "the r@xmath7  values , on the other hand , do change slightly for these different fits ( r@xmath7  @xmath2 17.3 @xmath19 3.5 kpc , 18.1 @xmath19 3.6 kpc , and 22.3 @xmath19 4.5 kpc , for the red , blue , and green profiles in figure  [ figcap18 ] , respectively ) , but the resulting h  i  disk radii are equal within the ( substantial ) errorbars . while differences from one system to another are expected",
    ", this simple test gives a baseline for how to interpret the measurements made using the position angles and inclinations derived from the _ sdss _ r - band images within the rest of the sample .",
    "we consider the r@xmath7  values for ic2271 , adbs113845 + 2008 , kissr561 , and kissr1021 to be accurate representations of their ( average ) physical size at the 10@xmath14 @xmath10 level .",
    "the r@xmath7  values in table  [ t7 ] for the other four systems should be considered upper limits on the physical size of each neutral gas disk .",
    "when available , we also tested how the disk size measurements change when using c configuration versus d configuration data .",

    "the radii of the galaxy disks , when using the c versus d configuration datasets , change from r@xmath7=8.74@xmath192.19 kpc to 11.6@xmath192.9 kpc ( ic2271 ) and from 17.3@xmath194.3 kpc to 21.6@xmath195.4 kpc ( adbs113845 + 2008 ) .",

    "a comparison of the morphology of the stellar and gaseous disks of each galaxy in the sample reveals that all eight systems have extremely compact ( though in almost all cases resolved ) stellar components ; this is of course expected given the selection criteria .",
    "seven of the eight systems in the sample harbor centrally concentrated neutral gas distributions .",
    "adbs113845 + 2008  differs from the other systems in that its neutral gas disk is structured in a broken ring that is well outside of the stellar component . in most of the other cases , the stellar and gaseous disks have surface brightness maxima that are in close physical proximity to one another .",
