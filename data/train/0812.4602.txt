    "quantum corrals were first demonstrated by arranging iron adatoms into a ring on a copper surface @xcite .",
    "several years later , an optical analogy to the electronic quantum corrals was proposed theoretically and realized in experiment by a skillful arrangement of nanoscale pillars @xcite . however , in both of the quantum corrals only static wave properties were studied experimentally . since the density image was obtained by sequential scanning over a period of time ,",
    "the experimental study of wave dynamics in these corrals is difficult if not impossible .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of atomic quantum corrals for bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "since the density distribution of a bec can be imaged snapshot by snapshot with a charge coupled device ( ccd ) , the atomic quantum corrals offer a great advantage over their electronic and optical counterparts , namely , the possible experimental study of the wave dynamics inside the corrals .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that rich dynamical structures of a condensate can arise in the quantum corrals due to reflection and interference .",
    "moreover , with the great deal of experimental control over the condensates @xcite , one is possible to study novel quantum behaviors , which are unimaginable for electronic or optical quantum corrals .",
    "for example , the dynamic evolution of a quantized vortex confined inside quantum corrals can be studied .",
    "of particular importance , the atomic quantum corrals proposed here can be used as a laboratory to study quantum chaos . even since the first creation of quantum corrals",
    ", it has been pursued to build stadium - shaped quantum corrals to visualize experimentally the scar `` states , a signature of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the stadium - shaped quantum corrals were built ; however , the visualization of quantum chaos has remained elusive because the quantum corrals are too leaky '' for electrons @xcite .",
    "our atomic quantum corrals are very flexible and can be made to minimize the leakageso that be used to explore quantum chaos experimentally .",
    "as an example , we demonstrate with numerical simulation that with atomic quantum corrals of stadium shape , one should be able to visualize experimentally the quantum chaotic behavior predicted in ref .",
    "we also show how the interference between two becs can be destroyed by chaos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the wave packet dynamics for a bec in a corral - like potential . in particular , the vortex evolution in a corral - like potential is studied . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the dynamic quantum chaos for a bec in stadium - shaped quantum corrals .",
    "a brief summary and discussion is given in the last section .",
    "we consider here a scheme to create quantum corrals for a bec illustrated in fig .",
    "an opaque sheet with a ring of holes is placed between a lens and a blue - detuned laser beam to create a corral - like repulsive potential for the condensate .",
    "the lens is to focus and adjust the sizes of the corrals \" .",
    "the holes in the opaque sheet are identical with a radius around or larger than 50@xmath0 m , which is large enough so that the diffraction of the laser beam can be ignored .",
    "this setup is similar to the one used to create a rotating quasi-2d optical lattice by a mask with a set of holes @xcite and a random potential @xcite for becs .",
    "one may also create this kind of quantum corrals by spatial light modulator or microlens array@xcite .    to simulate the dynamics of the cigar - shaped bec in the corrals",
    ", we can integrate out the axial degree of freedom . in this case , the bec dynamics is described by a two dimensional gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite:@xmath1where @xmath2 is a normalized wave function .",
    "the above equation has been made dimensionless with the length unit @xmath3 and the energy unit @xmath4 .",
    "the time unit is then @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the corral - like potential while @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the harmonic frequency in @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the @xmath13wave scattering length and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the trapping frequency in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "we numerically solve this gp equation to illustrate the wave dynamics inside the quantum corrals . in the numerical calculations , we consider @xmath17 atoms in the condensate and use @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22th gaussian potential @xmath23 created by a focused laser beam propagating along @xmath16 direction has the following form@xmath24 /\\sigma",
    "^{2}},\\]]where @xmath25 is the total power of a laser beam . @xmath26 with the rayleigh length @xmath27 . in the following calculations , @xmath28 @xmath29 . for a focused laser beam with wave length @xmath30",
    ", we have @xmath31 @xmath32 , which is much larger than the length ( about @xmath33 @xmath32 for the parameters in this paper ) of the cigar - shaped condensate . in this situation , along the @xmath16 direction , the condensate feels almost the same corral - like potential in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "thus , the two dimensional gp equation can be used very well to study the dynamics of a condensate in the corral - like potential .    to show clearly the fundamental properties of the atomic quantum corrals , we calculate numerically the evolution of the condensate confined in circle - shaped quantum corrals , which can be described as a series of gaussian potentials @xmath35 with @xmath36 distributed uniformly along a circle of radius @xmath37 . with the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42",
    ", we first get the ground - state wave function by using the widely used itp ( imaginary time propagation ) method",

    "the corral - like potential can be regarded as @xmath51 scattering sources , arranged along a circle .",
    "this discrete characteristic gives important modulation on the interference fringes . because of this",

    "a. ]    the corral - like potential plays a key role in the interference fringes of the density distribution . without the corral - like potential , the decreasing of the harmonic frequency will only lead to a width oscillation of the condensate @xcite .",
    "we have verified this by numerical calculations , which show that there are no interference fringes for this case .",

    "4d , the two different vortices have almost identical density distribution even though their sunflower - like structure indicates that the two becs have already felt the corral - potential .",
    "the rotational difference between the two becs shows up only when the main peak  of the condensate hits the corral - potential , as shown in figs .",

    "5a-5f show a series of snapshots for the condensate evolution .",
    "the regular density distribution is destroyed after a small number of reflections .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the dynamics of a moving bec in circle - shaped quantum corrals , which stays regular even after long - time evolution as shown in fig .",
    "this quantum chaotic behavior was firstly revealed in ref.@xcite for a free particle in a continuous stadium billiard . in this work ,",

    "5 can be regarded as the supposition of millions of classical trajectories .",
    "the random looking in fig .",
    "5 is just a reflection of the chaotic classical trajectories .",
    "in contrast to a free particle , there is interatomic interaction in a bec and the corral potential is discrete . as a result",
    ", one might expect with slight hesitation that a bec in stadium - shaped quantum corrals exhibits typical quantum chaotic wave dynamics .",
    "our numerical calculations above show that the hesitation can be cast aside .",
    "in fact , no obvious difference is found , compared to the situation of noninteracting bec .",
    "we have also considered the situation with increasing coupling constant .",

    "as mentioned at the beginning , it has remained elusive to visualize experimentally the quantum chaotic behavior in the electronic quantum corrals despite a great deal of effort@xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the quantum corrals are too leaky  for electrons .",
    "our above numerical studies show that the bec system provides a very good chance to experimentally visualize the quantum chaos : the stadium - shaped corrals can be built with the scheme shown in fig .",
    "the bec can gain a velocity with the method used for the experimental studies of quantum reflection@xcite .",
    "considering the length unit is @xmath94 @xmath32 in figs . 2 - 6 , a imaging resolution below @xmath94 @xmath32 is necessary to reveal the structure in these figures .",
    "fortunately , high resolution absorption imaging below @xmath95 @xmath32 has been achieved @xcite the chaotic behavior has been studied experimentally with nondegenerate ultracold atomic gases@xcite ; quantum chaos has been visualized with classical wave systems , such as sound and miscrowave@xcite .",
    "an eventual implementation of our scheme will be an experimental realization of quantum chaos with coherent matter wave , marking an important step forward in the experimental studies of chaos .    besides visualizing the known quantum chaotic behavior , we can try to explore more on quantum chaos with becs in a stadium - shaped corrals .",
    "for example , we can study the thermal effect on quantum chaos by placing non - condensed cold atoms and partially condensed cold atoms into the corrals .",
    "this is impossible for the electronic quantum corrals .",
