    "the study of transport phenomena  @xcite and in particular of diffusion processes  @xcite has developed considerably in the course of the last decades .",
    "one of the foundations of this area is the well - known diffusion equation , consequence of the central limit theorem  @xcite , that describes the random motion of a particle in an isotropic homogeneous three - dimensional space .",
    "the probability density function  ( pdf ) of the diffusing species being at a certain position  @xmath0 at time  @xmath1 , after a sufficiently high number of jumps and for an initial location at  @xmath2 , is given by the propagator  @xcite    @xmath3    with the root mean square displacement ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient of the diffusing species .    by the end of the last century",
    "it was recognized that the simple behavior in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - diffusioneq ] ) and  ( [ eq - diffusioncoeff ] ) was not completely general .",
    "the two most widely known deviations from the standard diffusive behavior are lvy flights  @xcite , coined and popularized by benoit maldelbrot , and richardson s law of turbulent diffusion  @xcite .",
    "recently , anomalous diffusion equations were also found to apply to in the econometric modeling and/or prediction  @xcite , in laser cooling of atoms  @xcite , in the foraging behavior of some animals  @xcite , and to the the scaling laws ruling human travel activities  ( critically connected to the geographical spreading of infectious diseases )  @xcite .",
    "situations deviating from the classical diffusion case can heuristically be described by a modified power law giving the scaling of the mean squared displacement as    @xmath6    anomalous diffusion results in the departure of the @xmath7 factor from unity in the last equation , owing to the non applicability of the classical central limit theorem , as a result of the presence of broad distributions or long - range correlations and non - local effects  @xcite .",
    "broad spatial jump or waiting time distributions lead to a non - gaussian and possibly a non - markovian time and spatial evolution of the system  @xcite , giving rise to anomalous behaviors that can be collectively described as  _ strange kinetics _  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq - diffusioncoeffscaling ] ) encompasses both the linear dependence of the mean squared displacement with time  ( @xmath8 ) characteristic of the standard brownian motion as well as nonlinear dependencies , slower  ( @xmath9 ) and faster  ( @xmath10 ) than the classical case .",
    "the _ below _ browian motion regime is usually named sub - diffusion or dispersive motion while the _ above _ range is known as hyper or superdiffusion . in order to generalize the classical treatment to consider anomalous diffusion , the continuous time random walk  ( ctrw ) model",
    "is often considered .",
    "the random trajectory is viewed as the result of pairwise stochastically independent spatial and temporal increment events . when both the variance of the spatial steps and the expectation value of the temporal increments are finite , ctrw is equivalent to brownian motion on large spatio - temporal scales  @xcite and yields ordinary diffusion .",
    "nevertheless , for the anomalous diffusion , a bifractional diffusion equation can be derived for the dynamics of @xmath11 .",
    "this can be solved using the methods of fractional calculus to give    @xmath12    where  @xmath13 is a one - sided lvy stable law of index  @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "this equation implies that the mean squared displacement scales as    @xmath15    the particle s motion can be classified either as a lvy flight , in the case that the _ time - of - flight _ of each jump in the trajectory is negligible , or as a lvy walk , if the finite time to complete each jump must be taken into account  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the stochastic theory of atomic resonance radiation migration under which the trajectories are of the supperdiffusive type .",
    "the radiation transport is usually described in terms of a master equation , which has an integro - differential form taking into account non - local effects  @xcite .",
    "this is usually known as the holstein - biberman equation , named after seminal contributions in the 1940s  @xcite .",
    "it was shown , first using ad  hoc arguments  @xcite and later demonstrated , that the motion of photons is superdiffusive .",
    "this was initially demonstrated for doppler and lorentz spectral line shapes and recently generalized for any line shape  @xcite .",
    "the work was done in the limit of complete frequency redistribution  ( cfr ) , a situation in which the collision rate is sufficiently high when compared to the lifetime of the excited state to destroy any correlation between photon absorption and ( re)emission events .",
    "this contribution aims to extend the previous work and discuss the influence of partial frequency redistribution  ( pfr ) effects in the stochastic description of the resonance radiation trajectories .",
    "we will show that the overall asymptotic behavior of the trajectories is dictated by the redistribution in the rest frame of the atom , even if in the lab rest frame memory effects persist in a finer scale .",
    "specifically , we will show that the doppler or lorentz cfr superdiffusive asymptotics are recovered for pfr if there is only doppler or doppler plus natural redistribution in the atom frame . on the contrary",
    ", we show for the first time , that the complete coherence in the atom s rest frame will manifest itself as a breakdown of the superdiffusive behavior in all cases and not only for the wing frequencies events .    in sec .",
    "ii the partial frequency redistribution  ( pfr ) effects are introduced along with the notation to be used . in sec .",
    "iii the single line opacity distribution function  ( odf ) under  pfr is defined .",
    "this is subsequently used to derive the the large scale asymptotics of the jump length distribution in sec .",
    "iv and of the opacity distribution in sec .",
    "v. section  vi makes a connection between the superdiffusive character and the low opacity asymptotic behavior of the  odf . in sec .",
    "vii numerical results are presented for the odfs and the conditional jump length probability distribution functions , and the influence of frequency redistribution in both a small scale  ( controlled by  pfr effects ) as well as in a large scale  ( corresponding to either a  cfr superdiffusive or , in alternative , a diffusive ) asymptotic are discussed .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized at the end  ( sec .",
    "resonance radiation trapping can be envisaged as a random flight with a jump size distribution dependent upon the spectral line shape .",
    "if all the scattering  ( absorption followed by reemission ) events are coherent in frequency , the radiation transport is described by a diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient dependent on the mean free path of the radiation",
    ". however , reabsorption - reemission events are inelastic , and a photon frequency redistribution in the lab reference frame exists preventing the notion of a mean free path .",
    "therefore , the topology of the excitation random trajectory has to be related with the frequency redistribution of the emitted photons , since the jump length probability distribution function  ( pdf ) must consider all possible optical emission frequencies .",
    "this can be done as  @xcite    @xmath16    where  @xmath17 is a frequency difference to the center - of - line frequency  @xmath18 , properly normalized by dividing by the corresponding width parameter  ( given for the doppler and lorentz spectral profiles as  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 , respectively , with  @xmath21 the most probable thermal velocity and  @xmath22 the radiative rate constant ) , @xmath23 is the emission spectrum lineshape , @xmath24 the photon exponential  ( beer - lambert ) jump distribution , and @xmath25 is the normalized absorption lineshape of the resonance line (  so that  @xmath26 ) .",
    "the dimensionless distance @xmath27 defines an _ opacity _ or _ optical density _ scale from the center - of - line optical depth  @xmath28 and the center - of - line absorption coefficient  @xmath29 . for a sufficiently high number of collisions during the lifetime of excited atoms ,",
    "the emitted photon has a frequency completely uncorrelated with the absorption frequency and so the radiation is completely redistributed over the entire spectral line .",
    "this corresponds to the complete frequency redistribution  ( cfr ) case , for which the emission and absorption line shapes coincide and the jump length pdf is independent of the past history . for strong resonance lines with short lifetimes",
    "the frequency redistribution is partial since only a few collisions occur before emission , and consequently the stochastic nature of the distribution must be considered .",
    "partial frequency redistribution  ( pfr ) effects are important in an astrophysical context , as is the case of the scattering of ly@xmath30 radiation in optically thick nebulae  @xcite and the ca  i resonance line in the solar spectrum  @xcite , as well as in lab scale atomic vapors , notably the @xmath31  nm mercury line in low - pressure lighting discharges ( which can account for as many as @xmath32 of the overall flux in a typical t12 fluorescence lamp )  @xcite and the @xmath33 and @xmath34  nm xe vuv radiation used in plasma display pannels  ( pdps ) applications  @xcite . for both mercury and xenon ,",
    "the natural lifetimes of the corresponding excited states are less than about @xmath35  ns and therefore only at very high densities is the collision rate high enough to approach cfr conditions .    for a two - level model in the cfr limit",
    ", both absorption and emission spectra lineshapes can be described by doppler  @xmath36  , lorentz  @xmath37  , or voigt  @xmath38  spectral distributions , in which @xmath17 is a normalized  ( with the doppler width ) difference to the center of line frequency and @xmath39 is the voigt characteristic width , a ratio of the lorentz to the doppler widths defined previously .",
    "the study of pfr was pioneered in the 1940s in an astrophysical context and we will use the notation introduced by hummer in the early 1960s  @xcite .",
    "pfr is described by a redistribution @xmath40 function which is the joint probability of absorption of a @xmath41 photon _ and _ reemission of a @xmath17  frequency photon .",
    "this redistribution function is derived for a thermal vapor , assuming a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution for ground state atoms and further imposing that the atoms velocity is unchanged upon excitation  ( assumption not valid for ultracold vapors ) .",
    "we will further consider unpolarized radiation  ( scalar redistribution function ) , use the angle averaged redistribution for an isotropic angular distribution reemission and discuss the three most important cases for a ground state absorbing state : ( i )  pure doppler broadening  ( @xmath42 ) , ( ii )  combined natural and doppler broadening  ( @xmath43 ) and ( iii )  combined doppler , natural and collisional broadening  ( @xmath44 )  @xcite . for the @xmath42 case ,",
    "both levels are infinitely sharp and there is pure coherent scattering in the atom s rest frame  ( arf ) .",
    "this is unrealistic because both the lower and upper levels of the optical transition are broadened to some extent by radiation damping and/or collisions .",
    "it is nevertheless useful since it allows the separation of the doppler shift from the other broadening mechanisms .",
    "the physical picture for @xmath43 is a line with an infinitely sharp lower level and an upper level broadened only by radiation damping . in the  arf",
    "the absorption is lorentzian and scattering is completely ( frequency ) coherent .",
    "this type of scattering is important for resonance lines in low density media where the collisions do not perturb the excited levels .",
    "@xmath44 applies whenever the upper state is broadened by radiation and collision damping in the limit where collisions are frequent enough to cause complete frequency redistribution in the arf .",
    "both absorption and reemission profiles are lorentzian in the atom s frame with a total width equal to the sum of the radiative plus collisional  ( uncorrelated ) characteristic widths .",
    "it is well known that complete redistribution in the arf does not imply the same quantitative behavior in the lab frame used to describe radiation transport . under the previously mentioned assumptions , the lab frame _ joint _ redistribution functions are given by  @xcite    @xmath45    @xmath46    -\\arctan \\left [ \\frac{\\overline{x}-u}{a}\\right ] \\right\\ } \\,{\\mathrm{d}}u    \\mbox{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath47    -\\arctan \\left [ \\frac{x^{\\prime } -u}{a}\\right ] \\right\\ } \\\\    & & \\times \\left\\ { \\arctan \\left [ \\frac{x+u}{a}\\right ]    -\\arctan \\left [ \\frac{x - u}{a}\\right ] \\right\\ }    \\,{\\mathrm{d}}u \\nonumber    \\mbox{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the total width",

    "( [ eq - pdfprpfr ] ) we need to use the ( re)emission pdf . for radiation transport in thermal vapors we can assume a cfr absorption profile which corresponds to the ensemble average over the maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the reemission distribution comes from the joint redistribution probability and , according to bayes rule , is given by    @xmath53    and it is this conditional ( re)emission pdf that should be used .",
    "@xmath54 is the absorption spectrum pdf which should be either the pure doppler distribution  ( @xmath42 ) or the voigt profile  ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig - ri ] to  [ fig - riii ] show the spectral distributions calculated from the previous equations .",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath44 distributions are symmetric , while @xmath43 is asymmetric . in all cases , a complete redistribution in the  arf",
    "does not imply cfr in the lab frame , the degree of redistribution in the lab frame being always bigger for core radiation and for the @xmath42 and @xmath44 cases .",
    "the complete coherence in the atom s rest frame for the @xmath43 model is not complete in the lab frame .",
    "however , the coherence degree is more retained for wing photons and higher  @xmath39 values  ( bigger importance of natural coherent broadening compared to doppler ) . on the other hand , for the @xmath44 distribution , the increase of the @xmath39 value implies higher redistribution in the core  ( bigger importance of collisional redistributed broadening ) .",
    "we will discuss now the influence of the redistribution between absorption and reemission in the asymptotic superdiffusive character of photon migration under pfr conditions .",
    "for this purpose we extend the concept of a single line opacity distribution function for incomplete redistribution .",

    "to study the superdiffusive behavior of resonance radiation trapping it is convenient to discuss the influence of the line shape in the opacity ( probability ) distribution function  ( odf ) . for that we will use a line opacity scale , defined from the normalized absorption line shape as @xmath56",
    "this line opacity scale will thus have no reference to the actual system size or number density and will be useful only for infinite media .",
    "this is the one chosen to discuss the  odf .",
    "the monochromatic line opacity along a given pathlength  @xmath57 , for homogeneously distributed particles , is  @xmath58 and is therefore proportional to the number density  @xmath59  ( or the pressure ) and to the center - of - line opacity  @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is the center - of - line absorption cross section as usual .",

    "this is done since any given jump distance must reflect the whole of the line shape and not just a given monochromatic opacity .",
    "we will now generalize the basic procedure used previously  @xcite for the complete frequency distribution to cover the partial frequency distribution  ( pfr ) case .",

    "in addition , we are able to demonstrate that , if redistribution into the tails of the absorption is prevented due to pfr memory effects , the superdiffusive character breaks down , and this can be seen in a cut - off in the pdf of the opacity at small line opacity values that is translated into a corresponding cut - off of the higher jump lengths .",

    "the cfr in the arf for the  @xmath44 will give rise to a lorentz cfr ( superdiffusive ) asymptotic in infinite media even under partial redistribution while the complete coherence in the arf for  @xmath43 will reveal itself in the lrf as a breakdown of the superdiffusive charater .",
    "the breakdown of the superdiffusion for thick vapors under  @xmath43 conditions is particularly important due to the widespread practice of reducing the actual complex behavior of the  @xmath43 redistribution into a linear superposition of complete frequency redistribution in the line core plus a complete coherence in the line wings .",
    "this practice is essentially motivated by the mathematical simplification that it allows and it can be traced back to the work of jefferies and white  @xcite  ( and it is therefore known as the jw - approximation ) .",
    "although the several implementations of the jw - approximation differentiate the photons from the core from those from the wings , all ignore the possibility that even the most extreme wing photons can be redistributed in frequency , thus neglecting the so - called `` difusion '' in frequency .",
    "moreover , the full redistribution function is skewed towards the line center and this is not taken into account .",
    "figure  [ fig - h - rii ] clearly shows another physical limitation of the jw - approximations which is generally not pointed out . for high opacity samples , the cfr assumption in core radiation is a severe approximation since cfr implies that radiation well into the wings can be emitted in a single scattering event , which can not occur ( an upper limit exists ) due to the breakdown of the doppler asymptotic .",
    "this contributes to show that the jw - type approximations are only acceptable for small voigt parameters and for overall center - of - line opacities roughly smaller than  @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of resonance radiation trapping started probably with holstein seminal work  @xcite and received afterwards a relevant contribution from van  trigt s infinite opacity expansion analysis in the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "asymptotic analysis is a very useful tool to calculate the large - scale behavior , which , from the derived scaling laws , can provide physical insight into more complex and realistic conditions .",
    "this is particularly true for partial redistribution in the  lrf .",
    "we clearly show that the large scale behavior is of the cfr lorentz superdiffusive type for complete redistribution in the  arf but of the diffusive character if the excited atom is intrinsically coherent  ( even if the small scale resembles the pure doppler superdiffusive character ) .",
    "so , one can use a generalized diffusive transport equation  @xcite for line radiation in this case , even if the effective mean transport coefficients will hide the details of the small scale partial redistribution effects .",
    "the present work is in this respect complementary of the asymptotic analysis of the integral equation of line radiation transfer carried out by frisch  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here is much simpler and straightforward than frisch s approach .",

    "this equation reflects the competition between complete redistribution in the  arf on the one hand and almost complete coherence on the other hand , depending on the elastic collisional rate .",
