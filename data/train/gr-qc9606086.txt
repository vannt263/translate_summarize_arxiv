    "<S> an investigation of the perturbations of the reissner - nordstrm black hole in the @xmath0 supergravity is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we prove in the extremal limit that the black hole responds to the perturbation of each field in the same manner . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that we can match the modes of the graviton , gravitino and photon because of supersymmetry transformations .    </S>",
    "<S> the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole is very important particularly in the context of supergravities . </S>",
    "<S> first , in supersymmetric theories the mass of the black hole is bounded below by its charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the extreme black hole saturates this bound . </S>",
    "<S> this mass bound is surprisingly identical to the bound imposed by the cosmic censorship conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can naturally avoid naked singularities in supergravity theories @xcite . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the extreme black hole has the symmetry that the nonextreme black holes do not have since the spacetime admits the killing spinor field , which means the extreme black hole is invariant under the supersymmetric transformations . </S>",
    "<S> the state is a close analogy of a bps saturated state for supersymmetric particles . </S>",
    "<S> second , all orders of quantum corrections should vanish in the extreme state . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of the supergravity theories may lead to an insight to the quantum effects around black holes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , the extreme black holes in supergravities have been discussed only in the case of static configurations . </S>",
    "<S> however , to know more about the role of black holes in the supergravity theories , we need to work on the dynamical aspects of black holes . in the preceding paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the quasinormal frequencies of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole in the einstein - maxwell theory and found an interesting fact that these frequencies were completely identical for both the electromagnetic and the gravitational perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the fact may be something to do with the supersymmetry , since the fields with different spins are related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we continue our analysis to the o(2 ) extended supergravity @xcite to investigate the perturbations of the reissner - nordstrm black holes to get an insight on the black hole in supergravity theories .    </S>",
    "<S> the o(2 ) extended supergravity field equations reduce to the usual einstein - maxwell equations when the gravitino fields vanish . by linearizing the field equations about a solution with vanishing gravitino fields </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a consistent set of equations for the photon , gravitino and graviton fields on a background solution of the einstein - maxwell equations . </S>",
    "<S> when we consider the reissner - nordstrm black hole as a background solution , these perturbation equations can all be reduced to the regge - wheeler type equations . for the graviton and photon @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the radial equations are given by @xmath1 z_s(r ) = 0 ,    \\label{eq : rw}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , \\\\    \\delta & = & r^2 - 2mr+q^2,\\\\    q_1     & = & 3 m- \\sqrt{9 m^2 + 4q^2 ( a-2)},\\\\    q_2     & = & 3 m+ \\sqrt{9 m^2 + 4q^2 ( a-2)},\\\\    a       & = & j_s(j_s+1 ) , \\\\   & &            j_s = l+s,\\hspace{1 cm } ( l=0,1,2, .... ).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cases of @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to the electromagnetic and the gravitational perturbation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and charge of the black hole , and @xmath7 is an angular multipole index of the perturbation . for the gravitino @xcite , the same equation as eq.([eq : rw ] ) is obtained . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the potential is given by @xmath8 , \\\\    </S>",
    "<S> f       & = & \\frac{r^6}{\\delta^{1/2}}g , \\\\   </S>",
    "<S> \\lambda & = & ( j_\\frac{3}{2}-\\frac{1}{2})(j_\\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{3}{2 } ) , \\\\   & &   j_{\\frac{3}{2}}=l+\\frac{3}{2 } , \\hspace{1 cm } ( l=0,1,2, ... </S>",
    "<S> ).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the extremal limit under the normalization of @xmath9 , the potentials for the three fields surprisingly reduce to similar forms : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 these three potentials are related in the following way : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive integer . </S>",
    "<S> the first equality is obvious in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v32 ] ) ; the potential of the rarita - schwinger field is identical to that of the electromagnetic field if we shift a multipole index by 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> the second equality is proved by using the readily verifiable relation @xmath16 therefore @xmath17 can be obtained by reflecting @xmath18 or @xmath19 about @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that this transformation corresponds to the exchange of the horizon and infinity . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mr ] ) means that a scattering problem for each perturbed field with a corresponding multiple index results in the same transmission and reflection amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the relation @xmath21 proves our numerical results in the previous paper @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the cases of the nonextreme black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to see how the susy breaking of the black hole influences on these three modes . </S>",
    "<S> since the potentials are complicated in the nonextreme cases , it is difficult to analytically find a symmetry even if it exits . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we will numerically calculate the quasinormal frequencies , which are the resonant poles of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence of these quasinormal modes is then a necessary condition for all fields to have the same transmission amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the quasinormal modes of black holes have so far been calculated through several methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the wkb method @xcite to calculate the quasinormal frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the wkb frequencies are related to the potential in the following : @xmath22 where the subscript 0 denotes the value at the top of the potential and the subscript @xmath23 is 0 or a positive integer called the mode number . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can evaluate how these potentials are close to each other . using the above formula </S>",
    "<S> , the first two quasinormal modes of the electromagnetic , gravitino s and gravitational perturbations for @xmath24 are calculated for nearly extreme black holes . as easily seen in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , three modes approaches continuously as the charge of the black hole increases and then meet in the extremal limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that only the extreme black hole preserves the supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> quasinormal frequencies of the electromagnetic field move fastest in the complex @xmath25 plane when we change the charge of the black hole , because the electromagnetic field is most sensitive to the change of the charge and quasinormal frequencies of the gravitino field is approximately the average value of the electromagnetic and the gravitational frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence found among the graviton , gravitino and photon in the extremal limit can be considered as a consequence of the supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole admits a killing spinor field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the background solution is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations with respect to the killing spinor field . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that all the perturbed fields can be related to each other using the supersymmetry transformations , which conserves the s - matrix . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the gravitino is matched with the photon by adding @xmath26 to the multipole index . </S>",
    "<S> since the multipole index @xmath7 here describes the total angular momentum , this shift is explained by the supersymmetric transformation that increases the spin by @xmath26 and hence increases the total angular momentum by @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> here we reach a new insight on the black hole in supergravities . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that for any supergravity theory the perturbed fields around the bps saturated black hole should have a similar behavior ; a scattering problem around the black hole is the same from one field to another . </S>",
    "<S> this is because all the fields can be matched with each other using supersymmetry transformations and the character of the black hole does not change whatever field we consider around it . </S>",
    "<S> recently the extreme black holes have been intensively studied in the context of the strings and d - branes and these studies have led to the first microscopic description of the black hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to explicitly obtain the supersymmetric transformations and relate them to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mr ] ) , because our scenario can be clearly understood and will shed new light on this subject . </S>",
    "<S> this is under investigation . </S>"
