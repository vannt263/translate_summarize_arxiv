    "we could have immediately stated that the variational functional @xmath4 provides an answer to the problem , all the more that in two dimensions @xmath5 depends linearly on the second derivatives of the coordinates along the curve thus producing exactly _ the third order _ variational ( called euler - poisson ) equation .    however , we wish to investigate , to what extent this answer in predefined by the limiting case of the euclidean space  the local model of the riemannian one . with this idea in mind",
