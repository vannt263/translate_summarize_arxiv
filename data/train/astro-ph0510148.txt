    "in @xcite we reported the measurement of fe and ti abundances in 35 m and k dwarf stars using atomic line equivalent width measurements from high resolution , @xmath3 , spectra . while the abundance survey provided useful results , it was clear that a method of estimating metallicity in cool dwarfs which works for fainter stars and which required less analysis effort was needed .",
    "although low temperature dwarf stars are the most numerous stars in the galaxy , their intrinsic faintness means that few of them are close enough for high resolution spectra to be measured .",
    "because the abundances derived depend on the metallicity of the model atmosphere , several iterations are required for each star before the model and derived abundances match .    because low temperature main sequence stars , m dwarf and cooler , make up most of the baryonic mass of the galaxy we must know their chemical compositions if we are to fully understand the chemical composition and evolution of the galaxy . an open problem in modelling the chemical evolution of the galactic disk is the ` g dwarf problem ' : fewer metal - poor g dwarfs are observed than models predict .",
    "the problem has been found to extend to stars with temperatures as cool as 4700  k @xcite . with a well - calibrated method to estimate m dwarf metallicities using low resolution",
    "spectra it will be possible to assemble a stastically significant sample of measurements and determine if the problem continues to stars with @xmath4  k or cooler .",
    "@xcite combined abundances they measured in 20 binaries with m - dwarf secondaries and warmer primaries with the metallicity measurements from @xcite to calibrate a @xmath5 and @xmath6 vs metallicity relation . because the relation depends on absolute magnitude it will be useful only for stars close enough for accurate parallaxes to be measured .    in this paper",
    "we report a metallicity calibration using the cah2 and tio5 indices .",
    "cah2 and tio5 are molecular indices which measure cah and tio band strengths in cool dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "these can be measured with lower resolution , @xmath7 , flux calibrated spectra , and require only the measurement of relative flux levels in specified wavelength bands in spectra which have been corrected to zero velocity , which requires much less observational time and analysis effort than measuring and analyzing equivalent widths of atomic lines in higher resolution spectra .",
    "this method will allow metallicities to be estimated for stars at least 3 magnitudes fainter and considerably more distant than can be observed at high resolution . with 4-m class telescopes ,",
    "stars fainter than @xmath8 can be observed with reasonable exposure times at this resolution . for a @xmath9 star",
    "this corresponds to a distance of about 160  pc , a greater distance than that for which reliable trigonometric parallaxes are available for large numbers of stars .",
    "we have measured abundances in additional cool dwarfs to extend the range of temperature and metallicity which can be for which the metallicity relation can be calibrated .",
    "we have also used binaries with f , g , or k primaries and m dwarf secondaries to test our abundance analysis method and to extend the temperature and metallicity range .",
    "we obtained spectra for the atomic line abundance analysis using the echelle spectrograph of the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath3 .",
    "the usable sections of the spectra cover a range from about 9800 to where the measured signal drops off in the blue , normally around 5000 for m dwarfs , and well below this for f and g dwarfs . because the stars in our first paper included few low metallicity ,",
    "@xmath1 < -0.5 $ ] , stars cooler than 3800 k , we obtained echelle spectra of additional m dwarfs with molecular band strengths which indicated they might have low metallicity .    to test the method we use to calculate abundances in m and k dwarfs , we observed a number of stars in binaries where one member is an f , g , or early k dwarf and the other is a k or m dwarf with a temperature in the range covered our other stars .",
    "most of these were selected from common proper motion pairs listed by @xcite .",
    "we also observed five hyades m and k dwarfs .",
    "we used the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) of the apo 3.5-m telescope to measure @xmath7 spectra of m and k dwarfs for which no tio and cah molecular band indices had been reported .",
    "the red arm of the spectrograph was set so the spectra cover the range @xmath10 .",
    "the echelle spectra were reduced using iraf routines as described in @xcite .",
    "the dis spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines to subtract the bias , divide by flat - field spectra , reduce to one - dimensional spectra , apply henear lamp spectra wavelength calibration , and do standard star flux calibrations .",
    "m and k dwarf atmospheric parameters were estimated using v , @xmath11 , and h photometric measurements @xcite and parallax distances as described in @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes and parallaxes of the m and k dwarfs observed for this paper are listed in table  [ t1 ] . for several stars we use the hipparcos parallax of their brighter binary companion .",
    "fe and ti abundances were calculated for the m and k dwarfs using atomic line equivalent width measurements and nextgen @xcite model atmospheres as described in @xcite .",
    "we measured equivalent widths of fe  i , fe  ii , ti  i , and ti  ii lines in the f , g , and early k stars in binaries with an m or k dwarf using iraf .",
    "temperatures were estimated using stromgren photometry @xcite .",
    "stellar masses and bolometric magnitudes were estimated using the theoretical @xmath12 vs @xmath13 isochrones of @xcite .",
    "we calculated stellar radii from the temperatures and bolometric magnitudes and calculated @xmath14 values from the radii and masses .",
    "we interpolated kurucz model atmospheres @xcite to the derived @xmath15 and @xmath14 values .",
    "microturbulent velocities for the f and g dwarfs were estimated using the empirical relation : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "fe and ti abundances were calculated from the model atmospheres and the measured equivalent widths using the current version of the lte stellar analysis program moog @xcite . the exception to this procedure was hip  13642 , where @xmath15 was estimated from the isochrones because no stromgren photometric data were available .",
    "the cah2 and tio5 molecular indices are ratios of the average flux levels in specified wavelength regions .",
    "we calculated the indices from the flux - calibrated dis spectra using the wavelength regions defined by @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric parameters and the fe and ti abundances derived for the 32 cool dwarf stars in table  [ t1 ] are listed in table  [ t2 ] . the metallicity [ m / h ] parameter listed is the effective metallicity after correcting for the effect of non - solar @xmath17-element to fe abundance ratios as described in @xcite .",
    "the quoted abundance uncertainties include the effects of uncertainty in temperature , gravity , and microturbulence and the scatter of abundances determined from different lines in the same star .",
    "the temperature and gravity uncertainties listed in table  [ t2 ] are the uncertainties derived from uncertainties in the input parallax and photometry data and do not include the effects of possible systematic errors , which could possibly be as large as about @xmath18 to 200 k for the temperature uncertainty and @xmath19 to 0.4 for @xmath14 .    to test our method of calculating abundances in cool dwarf stars we observed binaries with a cool dwarf secondary and a warmer dwarf primary .",
    "these were selected to have large enough angular separations that each component could be observed individually .",
    "most primaries were f or g dwarfs .",
    "we also observed five cool dwarfs in the hyades .",
    "the rationale for this test is that members of a binary or a cluster which formed from the same material should have the same chemical composition .",
    "diffusion and nuclear enrichment processes which can change photospheric abundances should not have any measurable effect in these unevolved stars .",
    "the model atmospheres and methods used to find abundances in f and g dwarfs are well established . the good agreement between solar system",
    "meteoritic and solar photosphere abundances for most elements is evidence that the photospheric abundances calculated for solar - type stars using these models and methods are reasonable .",
    "if our method for calculating abundances in cool dwarfs is accurate then the abundances should agree with those calculated for their warmer binary or cluster companions .",
    "the binary abundances are compared in table  [ t3 ] and figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "the reported f and g dwarf abundance uncertainties include the effects of uncertainty in temperature , gravity , microturbulence , and the scatter of abundances determined from different lines .",
    "temperature uncertainties due to uncertainties in the stromgren photometry of the warm stars are less than 40  k. the temperature uncertainty and the uncertainties in determining the mass and bolometric magnitude for the warm stars correspond to @xmath20 .",
    "we find that the the binary and cluster fe  i abundances agree to within the combined uncertainties except for those with cool dwarfs with @xmath21  k , which are indicated by open circles in the figure .",
    "the same pattern is seen for the ti  i abundances except that hd  18143b , bd+19  1185b , bd+17  791c , and lp  13 - 691 have abundance estimates a bit smaller than their warmer companions , even allowing for the uncertainties .",
    "our method of measuring chemical abundances in cool dwarfs appears to provide accurate results for stars with temperatures greater than 3500  k. a weakness of this test is that we were unable to observe only one such binary with @xmath1 < -0.5 $ ] : low metallicity stars are less common , and identifying low metallicty cool dwarfs which are also in widely separated visual binaries with f or g dwarf companions is even more difficult .",
    "the fact that we calculate similar abundances for both members of the binaries where the cooler member is warmer than 3500  k implies that the abundances we find for the warmer stars are not significantly affected by the possible problems caused by molecular bands .",
    "the metallicities of the binaries we studied were close to the solar metallicity .",
    "stars of lower metallicity would be less affected by weak line blanketting .",
    "there appears to be a systematic error causing the abundances calculated for stars cooler than 3500 k to be too large",
    ". it may be that the model atmospheres used do not sufficiently model the @xmath22 opacity which starts becoming much stronger at temperatures cooler than about 3500 k. it is also possible that increasing molecular band strengths at the cooler temperatures depress the apparent continuum in a molecular line haze , leading us to overestimate the atomic line equivalent widths .",
    "we note that because of this result , we are no longer certain of the abundances reported for lhs  450 in @xcite , the only @xmath23  k star in that paper .",
    "it should be possible , however , to calibrate our molecular index vs metallicity correlation to lower temperatures by including visual binaries .",
    "the last three binaries in table  [ t3 ] have secondaries which are too cool for abundances to be measured .",
    "we will assume that they have the abundances of their warmer companions .",
    "the molecular indices and fe abundances to be used for the metallicity calibration are listed in table  [ t4 ] .",
    "the stars listed include all those from this paper and @xcite for which molecular index data are available and 12 more from the other published reports .",
    "the abundances used for cool dwarfs in binaries with an f , g , or early k star are those of their warmer star .",
    "abundances for stars in the hyades or in a binary with two cool stars warmer than 3500  k are given by the average cluster or binary abundance .",
    "the uncertainties of the cah2 and tio5 index measurements are about @xmath24 @xcite or @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "cah2 is well correlated with effective temperature , as shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "tio5 depends on temperature and metallicity .",
    "the locations of the stars in the cah2 vs tio5 plane and their [ fe / h ] abundances are shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "metallicity decreases to the lower right in the figure as expected : for a given temperature or cah2 value , a smaller tio5 value indicates a smaller metallicity .",
    "we were unable to find an empirical polynomial fit to the data which corresponds well to the data .",
    "we have estimated the locations of equal - metallicity lines in cah2 vs tio5 by eye , as shown in table  [ t5 ] and figure  [ f4 ] . because the molecular band strengths decrease at higher temperatures , the fits start to converge for @xmath27 or @xmath28 k. molecular band strengths are poor indicators of metallicity at temperatures where the bands are very weak and the molecular index uncertainties correspond to large metallicity uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath24 molecular index uncertainties correspond to an [ fe / h ] uncertainty of about @xmath19 through the entire region covered by our calibration grid .",
    "we have now determined the fe and ti abundances for 84 m and k dwarf stars using high resolution spectra and equivalent width abundance analysis .",
    "we have tested our analysis method using stars in binaries and a cluster and find that it appears to give reliable abundances for stars warmer than 3500  k.    when we include abundance data for 12 stars from other researchers we have 76 stars with measured fe abundances and cah2 and tio5 indices .",
    "we have used these to create a rough molecular index  metallicity calibration .",
    "the main shortcoming of our data is that we have few low metallicity stars with @xmath29  k. our data are not yet sufficient to determine whether the difficulty in identifying very low metallicity stars is partly caused by an ` m dwarf problem ' similar to the g dwarf problem , where low metallicity stars are less common than predicted by galactic star formation and chemical evolution models . at a given temperature ,",
    "low metallicity stars are fainter than solar metallicity stars ; they are `` subdwarfs '' .",
    "this means they must be physically closer to appear bright enough for a spectrum with sufficient signal to be obtained .",
    "we have been granted time on the hobby - eberly telescope to observe several m dwarf stars with cah2 and tio5 indices which indicate they have @xmath1 < -1.0 $ ] , but which are too faint to observe with apo .",
    "the abundances calculated from these spectra will help populate the low metallicity region of the cah2 - tio5 plane .",
    "when the calibration is adequately defined it will be possible to estimate the metallicities of thousands of cool dwarf stars .",
    "thousands of spectra of red dwarf stars have already been observed in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "while the abundances estimated through a molecular index calibration will necessarily have larger uncertainties than those calculated through the analysis of atomic line strengths in high resolution spectra , they will be sufficient to allow statistical study of the relative numbers of cool dwarfs of different metallicities and a determination whether the g dwarf problem continues to lower masses , i.e. whether low metallicity m dwarfs are more scarce than models predict .",
    "we thank nicole silvestri for obtaining some of the dis spectra used for our molecular index measurements , peter hauschildt for continuing help with nextgen model atmospheres and suzanne hawley for helpful discussions about low mass subdwarfs .",
    "we thank iain reid for providing low resolution spectra to recheck the molecular indices of a couple stars .",
