    "this matter has also been discussed by nova @xcite , who introduced some modifications in the cam - clay model in order to satisfy the isotropic condition @xcite .",
    "however , we are going to show from a micro - mechanical inspection that the orientational distribution of the sliding contacts departs from the isotropy for extremely small deviatoric loadings .",

    "[ fig : fabric and force ] . in this case , the mean value of the orientation of the branch vector with respect to the direction of the loading is around @xmath236 , which means that the sliding between the grains occurs principally around @xmath237 with respect to the vertical .",

    "this relation is more appropriate than just an explicit relation between the flow rule and the stress , which probes to be only valid in the case of monotonic loading @xcite .",
    "since the stress can be expressed in terms of micro - mechanical variables , branch vectors and contact forces , the identification of those internal variables measuring anisotropy and force distribution would provide a more general description of the dependence of the flow rule on the history of the deformation .",
    "the effect of the anisotropy of the contact network on the elasto - plastic response of a voronoi tessellated sample of polygons has been investigated .",
    "the most salient aspects of this anisotropy are summarized as follows :    * the incremental elastic response has a centered ellipse as an envelope response . below the stress ratio @xmath183 , this response can be described by the two material parameters of hooke s law of elasticity : the young modulus and the poisson ratio . above this stress ratio",
    "there is a dependence of the stiffness on the stress ratio , which can be connected to the anisotropy induced in the contact network during loading .",
    "we should state that this result might be dependent on the preparation procedure .",
    "in particular , samples with void ratio different from zero show a smooth transition to the anisotropy , which requires further studies . * the plastic envelope responses lie almost on the straight line defining the plastic flow direction @xmath140 .",
    "the yield direction @xmath140 and the plastic modulus @xmath199 have also been calculated directly from the plastic response .",
    "the flow direction and yield direction depend on the stress ratio .",
    "in particular , the plastic flow for zero stress ratio has a non - zero deviatoric component suggesting an anisotropy induced for extremely small deviatoric strains .",
    "we found that this effect comes from the fact that the sliding contacts depart from anisotropy when the sample is subjected to the smallest deviatoric deformations .",
    "we have also shown a correlation between the mean orientation of the sliding contacts and the flow direction of the plastic deformations . * in the investigation of the connection between the plastic deformation and the number of sliding contacts , we found that the plastic modulus @xmath199 decays exponentially as the fraction of sliding contacts increases .",
    "this contrasts with the linear decrease of the young modulus @xmath142 with the increase of the number of open contacts , suggesting that the deformation of the granular assembly is concentrated around the sliding contacts .    since the mechanical response of the granular sample",
    "is represented by a collective response of all the contacts , it is expected that the constitutive relation can be completely characterized by the inclusion of some internal variables , containing the information about the micro - structural arrangements between the grains .",
    "we have introduced some internal variables measuring the anisotropy of the contact force network .",
    "the fabric coefficients @xmath194 , measuring the anisotropy of the network of all the contacts , prove to be connected with the anisotropic stiffness .",
    "on the other hand , the fabric coefficients @xmath241 , measuring the anisotropy of the sliding contacts , are related to the plasticity features of the granular materials .",
