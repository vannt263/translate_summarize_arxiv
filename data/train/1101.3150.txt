    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in @xmath6  @xcite has stimulated considerable research efforts on the search of new superconducting materials and the elucidation of its pairing mechanism .",
    "resembling the copper oxides , the iron pnictides crystalize in a layered structure and superconductivity occurs upon suppressing the magnetic order either by chemical doping  @xcite or by applying pressure  @xcite .",
    "however , these new superconductors also exhibit their own unique properties . instead of a mott - insulator",
    "as observed in cuprates , the parent compounds of iron pnictides are usually bad metals  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nearly isotropic superconductivity  @xcite and three dimensional energy dispersion  @xcite have been observed in some iron - based superconductors even though they possess a layered crystal structure .",
    "these findings are surprising and deserve further research in order to check their generality .    in a multi - band system",
    ", the electronic properties might strongly depend on the electron / hole doping level , which would accordingly change the anisotropy of the upper critical field .",
    "experimental confirmation on it might further support the multi - band superconductivity in iron pnictides . moreover , the value of @xmath0 can be largely enhanced by introducing disorder in a multi - band superconductor , e.g. in @xmath7  @xcite . one related question is whether the large @xmath4 observed in iron pnictides is intrinsic or an effect of disorder .",
    "elucidation of these questions would help to catch the intrinsic information of superconductivity in iron pnictides .",
    "here we report the measurements of magnetoresistance in single crystals of @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is indeed found that the upper critical field of all these compounds show rather weak anisotropic effect .",
    "the observation of huge @xmath4 ( @xmath9130 t ) in @xmath8 , whose sample quality has been improved in comparison with those previously presented in ref  @xcite , indicates that the large upper critical field is an intrinsic and general feature of iron pnictides .",
    "single crystal of @xmath1 and @xmath8 were synthesized by solid state reaction method using feas as flux  @xcite .",
    "the derived crystals were characterized to be a single phase by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) with cu @xmath10 radiation at room temperature .",
    "the doping concentration of k in @xmath2 is nominal value .",
    "the electrical resistance at zero field , @xmath11 , was measured with a lakeshore ac resistance bridge .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity , @xmath12 , was measured up to 60 t using a typical 4-probe method in a capacitor - bank - driven pulsed magnet .",
    "the data traces were recorded on a digitizer using a custom designed high - resolution , low - noise synchronous lock - in technique . in order to minimize the inductive heating caused by a pulsed magnetic field ,",
    "small crystals with typical size 2mm@xmath130.5mm@xmath130.1 mm were cleaved off along the _",
    "c_-direction from the as - grown samples .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the electrical resistance at zero field for @xmath1(#n1 ) and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that no anomalies of structural / magnetic phase transitions are visible at high temperature , suggesting that these samples are likely located in the optimal doing region.the superconducting transition temperature , determined from the mid - point of the superconducting transition , gives @xmath14k and 36.8k for @xmath1(#n1 ) and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the sharp superconducting transitions ( see the inset of fig.[fig1 ] ) indicate a good sample quality for both @xmath1(#n1 ) and @xmath8 . in comparison with those samples reported in ref  @xcite , @xmath2 studied here shows a higher @xmath15 and a larger value of residual resistivity ratio ( _ rrr _ ) , further supporting the improvement of sample quality .",
    "( # n1 ) and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the insert enlarges the section at the superconducting transition.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the evolution of superconductivity with magnetic field is shown in fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath1(#n2 ) and @xmath2 , respectively . in both figures , the top panel ( a ) is for magnetic field in the ab - plane and the bottom one ( b ) is for field along the c - axis . obviously , the superconducting transition is shifted to lower temperature upon applying a magnetic field . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the critical field required to suppress superconductivity is slightly different for the two magnetic field orientations applied along the c - axis and the ab - plane , but superconductivity in @xmath8 is not yet suppressed even by applying a field of 60 t .",
    "the much higher critical field in the k - doped material is likely attributed to its much higher @xmath15 .",
    "( a ) @xmath16 and @xmath17=1.4k , 4.7k , 6k , 8k , 10k , 12k , 13k , 14k , 15k ; ( b ) @xmath18 and @xmath17=1.5k , 4k , 6k , 8k , 10k , 12k , 14k , 16k ( from bottom to top).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    : ( a ) @xmath16 and ( b ) @xmath18 .",
    "the temperatures are labeled in the figure with a unit of kelvin.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        fig.[fig4 ] shows the scaled upper critical field , @xmath19 , as a function of reduced temperature , @xmath20 , for ( a ) @xmath1 and ( b ) @xmath21 , respectively . here the value of @xmath0 at each temperature is determined from the 50% drop of its normal state resistivity just above @xmath15 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures ( @xmath15 ) , obtained from the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at zero field , are shown to be 27.6k ( # n1 ) and 14.8k ( # n2 ) for @xmath1 ; 36.8k ( # k1 ) and 28.2k ( # k2 ) for @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that the sample # n1 was unfortunately broken while changing the field orientation to @xmath22 and , therefore , only the data with magnetic field applied along the _ c_-axis is shown .",
    "the upper critical fields for sample @xmath2 ( named as # k1 here ) , as well as the one reported in ref  @xcite ( sample # k2 ) , are included in fig .  [ fig4](b ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one can see that the upper critical fields of these two compounds show good scaling behavior with @xmath15 , indicating that the large upper critical field is an intrinsic feature of the iron pnictides . in this case , the actual upper critical field may strongly depend on the superconducting transition @xmath15 and , therefore , on the sample compositions or sample quality .",
    "for example , the upper critical field @xmath4 of @xmath2 ( # k1 ) is determined as 130 t according to the scaling behavior together with inputs of @xmath4 = 70 t and @xmath23k from sample # k2  @xcite .",
    "such a large @xmath4 far exceeds the weak - coupling pauli paramagnetism limit , given by @xmath24 68 t , which might indicate an unconventional type of superconductivity in iron pnictides .",
    "whether the large upper critical field is attributed to the pauli paramagnetism  @xcite or the orbital effect  @xcite remains unclear .",
    "however , the weak anisotropy of @xmath5 seems to support the later as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the anisotropic coefficient @xmath25 , defined as @xmath26 , is plotted in the insets of fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "one can see that , in all these 122 compounds , the value of @xmath25 decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature , showing rather weak anisotropy at low temperatures .",
    "such a weak anisotropy of @xmath5 is remarkably distinct from those shown in the high @xmath15 cuprates and the organic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the curvatures of @xmath5 in @xmath1 and @xmath21 are somewhat different ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) : in the former one ( sample # n2 ) , the upper critical field shows linear temperature dependence for fields applied either in the ab - plane or along the c - axis , but the two curves of @xmath5 merge together at low temperature in the later compound .",
    "evidence from both experimental measurements  @xcite and band structure calculations  @xcite has shown that the iron pnictides are multi - band systems , consisting of electron pockets and hole pockets .",
    "doping of holes in the compounds as studied here would modify the electronic structure and , therefore , change the detailed temperature dependence of the upper critical field .",
    "the slightly distinct anisotropic behavior of @xmath5 in these two compounds might be attributed to the variant doping levels as what we also observed in ba(fe , co)@xmath27as@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "it is noted that a pronounced upturn curvature is observed near @xmath15 in @xmath8 , which might originate from the multi - band effect of the system as well .",
    "based on the results measured here for the hole - doped compounds and those previously investigated for the electron - doped compounds  @xcite , weak anisotropy of superconductivity seems to be a general feature of the iron pnictides , in particular for the 122-system and the 11-compound .",
    "the anisotropic properties are usually determined by the underlying electronic structure , which was found to be rather two dimensional in cuprates and organic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "however , our measurements indicate that the electronic structure of the iron pnictides might be more like three dimensional  @xcite , which has been confirmed by recent arpes measurements  @xcite .",
    "all these suggest that the inter - layer coupling would play an important role in understanding the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "we would also like to point out that the weak anisotropic and large upper critical field are unique features of the iron - based superconductors , which will make them very promising materials for future applications .",
    "in summary , we have determined the upper critical fields @xmath5 of @xmath1 and @xmath8 by measuring the electrical resistivity in a pulsed magnetic field .",
    "it was found that these compounds show large values of @xmath4 and relatively weak anisotropy of superconductivity at low temperature in general .",
    "the upper critical fields obtained from variant samples can be well scaled with its superconducting transition @xmath15 .",
