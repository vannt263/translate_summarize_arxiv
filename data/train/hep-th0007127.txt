    "noncommutative models appear to be relevant to the description of various aspects of string theory @xcite .",
    "an approach to noncommutative gauge theories can be developed using matrix models @xcite in the limit of large matrices .",
    "compactifications of these models to noncommutative tori was shown to yield the noncommutative yang ",
    "mills models @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative tori correspond to matrix configurations in the ikkt model having _ nondegenerate _ scalar commutator in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "although , at infinite matrix size these configurations solve equations of motion , they do not correspond to local minima of the classical action , and therefore do not contribute at the level of perturbation theory .",
    "however , due to their large entropical factor these configurations should become important in the strong coupling regime .    in the case of finite @xmath2 one can construct a map from the matrix model to some kind of non - commutative lattice gauge model ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the limit @xmath1 was studied by the author in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that this limit is ambiguous at least in the perturbative approach .",
    "the ambiguity consists in the fact that depending on the background solution chosen one has in the @xmath1 limit either ten - dimensional yang  mills  type model or its reductions to lower dimensions .    in what follows",
    "we will start with a particular choice from the variety of possible models arising in the @xmath1 limit of the ikkt matrix model .",
    "we are going to show that in fact there is a wide universality among these models , in particular , matrix fluctuation around a @xmath0-dimensional ( commutative ) solution are completely equivalent to perturbations around the mentioned configuration having nondegenerate scalar commutator in @xmath3 dimensions and corresponding to noncommutative tori .",
    "this equivalence become manifest due to the possibility to absorb the kinetic term in noncommutative gauge models .    also , we explicitly build a one - to - one map from one - dimensional noncommutative gauge model to the @xmath0-dimensional one using the isomorphism of hilbert spaces .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional model can be implemented as a solution in the one - dimensional case while the last can be obtained through the dimensional reduction of the former .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we review some results concerning ikkt model , after that we describe the equivalence between fluctuations around commutative / noncommutative solutions , and finally find the solution which gives the map from two- to the @xmath0-dimensional noncommutative models , and discuss the implications of this map .    for the notations and background of this work we refer the reader to the ref .  @xcite .",
    "start with the ikkt model at finite @xmath2 .",
    "it is given by the classical euclidean action , @xmath5 ^ 2-\\bar{\\psi }      \\gamma^\\mu[x_\\mu,\\psi],\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are scalar and spinor matrices with large size @xmath1 .",
    "note that in this paper the greek labels always run in ten dimensions , @xmath8 .",
    "this model possesses a number of properties such as supersymmetry , so(10)-lorentz and su(n)-gauge invariances @xcite .    at finite @xmath2 ,",
    "the only classical solutions to this model are given by sets of commuting matrices @xmath9 , @xcite , @xmath10=0.\\ ] ]    if eigenvalues of matrices @xmath9 form a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , where @xmath0 is an arbitrary integer in the range , @xmath11 , then they can be expressed as functions of @xmath0 independent matrices @xmath12 , where the latin indices run through @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath13 .    in the limit @xmath1 matrix fluctuations around such a background",
    "are described by a @xmath0-dimensional yang ",
    "mills type model .",
    "in particular , when @xmath14 , and matrices @xmath9 are independent one can identify them with @xmath12 .",
    "( in this case the sets of greek and latin indices coincide . )",
    "the limiting @xmath4 model in this case is equivalent to one given by the following action , @xcite , @xmath15 where , @xmath16_{\\star}(x , l ) \\\\ \\label{nabla }    & \\nabla_\\mu\\psi(x , l)={{\\partial}_\\mu}\\psi(x , l )    -g[{\\mathcal{a}}_\\mu,\\psi]_{\\star}(x , l).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here derivatives are computed with respect to @xmath17 , and they are given by , @xmath18,\\ ] ]    commutators in eqs .",
    "( [ s_func][deriv ] ) are computed using the star product , @xmath19_{\\star}={\\mathcal{a}}\\star { \\mathcal{b}}-{\\mathcal{b}}\\star { \\mathcal{a}},\\ ] ] while the star product itself is defined as , @xmath20 here @xmath21 ( the same as @xmath22 ) parameterise the spectrum of @xmath12 , while @xmath23 are coordinates on the ( fourier ) dual space @xcite .    in the case",
    "when @xmath24 the model is given by the reduction of ( [ s_func ] ) to @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "in this case , @xmath23 and @xmath21 are @xmath0-dimensional and the set of greek indices comes split in two subsets formed by latin indices @xmath25 and other one of kaluza ",
    "klein multiplet indices which appear upon reduction to @xmath0 dimensions from 10 dimensions",
    ". we will not introduce the last type of indices , because along this paper we do not need the this split explicitly , but keep instead the greek letters for both space - time and kaluza  klein multiplets . in this case",
    "the derivative terms generalise according to ( [ deriv ] ) , and the dimensional reduced action keeps the same form as given by eqs .",
    "( [ s_func][prod- > * ] ) , but one should keep in mind that @xmath26 in this case denote both the @xmath0-dimensional gauge field and the kaluza  klein scalars .    using the moyal correspondence , the algebra of @xmath27-functions supplied with the star product ( [ scom ] )",
    "can be seen as a representation of the @xmath0-dimensional heiseberg algebra with the weyl ordering prescription which is generated by @xmath21 and @xmath23 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath28 and satisfying the commutation relation , @xmath29=-{\\mathrm{i}}\\delta_i^j.\\ ] ] in this case the integration over @xmath30 is equivalent to taking the trace over @xmath28 . in what follows we will not distinguish between these two forms .    by a redefinition of field @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 one can absorb the kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ s_func ] ) . as",
    "a result one has the model described by the action ( in heisenberg form ) , @xmath33 ^ 2 +     \\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu[{\\mathcal{a}}_\\mu,\\psi]\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath7 are hermitian operators of @xmath0-dimensional heisenberg algebra which act on @xmath35 and are represented by noncommutative functions on @xmath36 , the trace @xmath37 denotes the integration over noncommutative phase space , @xmath38 .",
    "once again note that @xmath39 , while the fields are defined on @xmath3-dimensional noncommutative space generated by @xmath40 and @xmath17 .",
    "let us note that in the form ( [ s_op ] ) the model is manifestly invariant with respect to reparameterisations of @xmath41 preserving the commutator ( [ canon ] ) .",
    "although , the action ( [ s_op ] ) or its dimensional reductions are obtained as a continuum limit of fluctuations around a commutative background ( @xmath42=0 $ ] ) , one can show that the same model can be obtained as a continuum limit of fluctuations around a configuration with @xmath42={\\mathrm{i}}b_{\\mu\\nu}\\neq 0 $ ] , in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "in other words , the model ( [ s_op ] ) is equivalent to the u(1 ) non - commutative yang  millls model in @xmath3 dimensions @xcite , when @xmath43 , or its @xmath3 dimensional reduction when @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , consider action ( [ s_op ] ) in the case of @xmath45 .",
    "after shifting back the fields @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for @xmath51 the action ( [ s_op ] ) becomes one of the 10-dimensional noncommutative u(1 ) yang  mills model . ) .",
    "this correspondence is possible since @xmath0-dimensional heisenberg algebra coincides with @xmath3-dimensional noncommutative space . ]",
    "the same trick can be made for any @xmath52 , however , the meaning of the model when @xmath53 is not yet clear , but as we are going to demonstrate later this is not a problem since any @xmath54 model is equivalent to the @xmath55 .",
    "in this section we consider the model given by the action ( [ s_op ] ) with @xmath55 , which means that the fields are defined as functions on the one - dimensional heisenberg algebra generated by @xmath40 and @xmath17 , satisfying usual commutation relation , @xmath56=-{\\mathrm{i}}\\hbar,\\ ] ] which is the same as two - dimensional noncommutative space .",
    "let us note that the one - dimensional solution is one having the largest entropical factor @xcite in the ikkt matrix model .    for convenience consider the heisenberg algebra to be defined on a circle : @xmath57 .",
    "in this case the momentum operator @xmath40 have discrete spectrum .",
    "its eigenvalues are given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "later one can take the limit @xmath60 .",
    "consider the equations of motion for this model .",
    "vacuum solutions ( with @xmath61 ) , are given by the commutative sets of operators @xmath62 . in terms of `` smooth '' functions and up to a gauge transformation ,",
    "they are given by the arbitrary functions @xmath63 .",
    "as it is generally known , two and more _ continuous _ functions of one variable always form a functional dependent set , therefore , the set of @xmath63 is a such one if @xmath63 are continuous functions of @xmath40 .",
    "this property , however does not hold for the discontinuous functions .",
    "after the kinetic term absorption the equations of motion are no more differential equations , thus the condition imposed one the solutions of equations of motion to be smooth functions are no more justified and can be given up .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of @xmath40 itself is discrete .    from the other hand , since the smoothness properties are strictly related to the notion of topology of the space - time , the non - smooth solution can be interpreted as the changing of the space - time topology .",
    "the space - time topology can be extracted from the set of operators @xmath62 in the framework of connes approach @xcite .",
    "consider that the solution @xmath62 now carries the attributes of the @xmath0 dimensional space , i.e. they form a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , and can be expressed as functions of the basic set of independent operators @xmath21 , @xmath13 .    in what follows",
    "let us construct an explicit solution with functionally independent ( and , therefore , discontinuous ) @xmath64 .",
    "since eigenvalues of @xmath40 and @xmath21 form , respectively , one - dimensional and @xmath0 dimensional lattices , the solution @xmath64 is given explicitly by the map from the one - dimensional lattice @xmath65 of the eigenvalues of @xmath40 to the @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath66 of eigenvalues of @xmath21 . due to the reparameterisation invariance one can take both lattices to be regular and rectangular ones .",
    "the map can be constructed through the following sequence of steps ( the particular case for @xmath67 is depicted in the figure ) .    1",
    ".   map the origin of @xmath65 to the origin of @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   map @xmath0 points next to origin in the positive direction and @xmath0 ones in negative direction of @xmath65 to the nearest neighbor points to the origin of @xmath66 , using e.g. lexicographic ordering .",
    "3 .   fill the the remaining points of the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube of two lattice unites size centered at origin of @xmath66 by images of @xmath68 points of @xmath65 .",
    "4 .   in the same manner",
    "fill the next hyper - cubic shell of @xmath66 by images of of points of @xmath65 , etc .",
    "thus , @xmath69 points around the origin of @xmath65 fill the hyper - cube of the size @xmath70 centered at the origin of @xmath66 .",
    "as it can be seen by the construction the map is one - to - one .",
    "however , the resulting operators @xmath21 are functionally independent . under this map small momenta",
    "are transfered to small momenta , and large ones to large ones .",
    "this means that respectively low / high energy states of one model are mapped into low / high energy sector of another one .",
    "this correspondence allows one to pass from the one dimensional heisenberg algebra to the heisenberg algebra in arbitrary dimension @xmath54 ( or from two - dimensional noncommutative space to @xmath3 dimensional one ) .    indeed , using the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite one can introduce for each operator @xmath21 its canonical conjugate @xmath23 , satisfying the heisenberg commutation relation in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath71=-{\\mathrm{i}}\\delta_i^j.\\ ] ]    one can , therefore , pass from ( [ s_op ] ) with @xmath55 to the equivalent description as a model in a different dimension @xmath54 .",
    "let us shortly describe the construction @xcite . consider the eigenvalue problem for adjoint operators @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "this problem is consistent since @xmath74 and @xmath75 are commutative and self - adjoint on the space of square integrable operators with bounded @xmath74 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is solved by the ( eigen)operators , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are eigenvalues of @xmath74 and @xmath79 respectively . since , by the construction , both @xmath41 and @xmath36",
    "can be represented on the same hilbert space @xmath80 , ( in fact , we introduced isomorphism between @xmath80 and @xmath35 ) , one can expand an arbitrary square integrable operator @xmath81 of original model in the @xmath82 basis , using the trace over the hilbert space of the one - dimensional heisenberg algebra , and get an operator @xmath83 in the @xmath0-dimensional model , @xmath84 where , @xmath85    applying this procedure to the fields in model ( [ s_op ] ) with @xmath55 , one obtains the equivalent description in terms of a @xmath0 dimensional model with any @xmath54 .",
    "formally , we have introduced here a noncommutative ( and discontinuous ) change of variables . indeed ,",
    "since @xmath21 and @xmath23 are invertible functions of one - dimensional @xmath40 and @xmath17 , one can find their inverse , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and plough this dependence in the one - dimensional operator @xmath81 to get the function @xmath88 which is a @xmath0 dimensional operator .",
    "now we can give the following physical implication of this construction .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional noncommutative gauge model describes , in fact , the a d@xmath89-brane where @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "we constructed a solution in the two - dimensional noncommutative gauge model which has the meaning of @xmath3 dimensional space .",
    "this solution gives the correspondence between the gauge models ( gauge fields interacting with kaluza  klein scalars ) in various even dimensions .",
    "taking into account the brane interpretation of the noncommutative gauge models with scalar fields , this describes the condensation of d1-branes to a d@xmath89-brane , where @xmath91 . from this point of view the multiple vacua of the ikkt model ref .",
    "@xcite , are nothing else than the condensation of d(-1)-branes described by the ikkt matrices to an arbitrary iib brane ( i.e. a brane with even - dimensional world - sheet ) , which is the @xmath3-dimensional reduction of the ten - dimensional noncommutative u(1 ) gauge model .",
    "let us briefly summarise the results of this note .",
    "first , we have shown that the model desribing the continuum limit of fluctuations of the ikkt matrix model around a commutative background , @xmath92=0 $ ] , in @xmath0 dimensions is equivalent to one describing fluctuations around a @xmath3 dimensional background satisfying , @xmath93={\\mathrm{i}}b_{ij}$ ] , where @xmath94 is a nondegenerate antisymmetric scalar matrix .",
    "`` physically '' this means that in the singular limit @xmath95 corresponds to doubling of the dimensionality of the noncommutative gauge model .",
    "second , we demonstrated that the noncommutative model in @xmath96 dimensions can be isomorphically mapped to the @xmath3-dimensional one .",
    "the last feature may be interpreted as the noncommutative geometry counterpart of the duality relating various branes or their condensation , @xcite .    in early works on ikkt model @xcite ,",
    "it was conjectured that this in the limit @xmath1 generates the space - time as the set of expectation values of operators @xmath6 . in this context",
    "it seems natural that the topology and , in particular , the space - time dimensionality are also generated by the solution @xmath64 .",
