    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) plays a central role in topological insulator ( ti ) materials , @xcite it opens a gap inside the bulk but supports the gapless electron states on the boundary . on the boundary of ti ,",
    "impurity potential scattering is restricted by time - reversal symmetry : @xcite the backscattering among the electrons is allowed only if it is accompanied by a spin flip .",
    "this restriction gives rise to novel kondo physics of magnetic impurities in ti .",
    "@xcite accordingly , the behavior of magnetic impurities in host materials with soc has recently attracted interest . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems ,",
    "several theoretical papers @xcite report that the presence of the soc can in general protect impurity s magnetic moment from being totally screened .",
    "however , for the specific case of the rashba coupling @xcite it has been reported that the soc only makes a small or a high - order contribution to kondo scaling",
    ".    in general , soc and energies associated with the kondo screening of magnetic impurities can be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it remains to be explored what effects arise when crossing over from weak to strong soc .",
    "in particular , the question of how the impurity behaves when the host undergoes a topological phase transition from a normal state to ti is an open question .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an anderson impurity on the edge of a zigzag graphene ribbon with a kane - mele type soc gradually strengthened , so that a topological phase transition occurs in the system .",
    "using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations at finite temperature , we perform a comprehensive study on the properties of impurity . calculating local physical quantities on the impurity site , such as the average double occupancy , magnetic moment , spin susceptibility and spectral densities",
    ", we find that in general the soc can support the local moment formation .",
    "we see that in the case of zero or weak soc , impurity is mainly dominated by its coupling with localized edge states , realizing a situation similar to the zero band width anderson ( zbwa ) model . in the case of strong soc ,",
    "the edge states are greatly broadened and the local density of states ( ldos ) is suppressed , so that the impurity behaves as a spin in a normal metal .",
    "this difference between strong and weak coupling also manifests itself in the dependence of the local moment on chemical potential , which in graphene can be tuned by a gate voltage .",
    "we also study nonlocal linking of the electrons on impurity with those in the conduction band . in nonlocal two - particle correlations ,",
    "we observe a set of distinct spin - momentum relations which show the helical locking and interplay between backscattering and spin flip .",
    "this interplay signals the appearance of a topological phase in the host .",
    "additionally , we find the spin rotation symmetry in kondo cloud around impurity to be partially broken by the soc",
    ". this finding agrees with a previous study of an anderson impurity in 2d helical metal with variational method that is valid for large coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite in this work , we study the effect of electron - electron interaction over a wide regime and document that the coulomb interaction enhances the anisotropy in spin - spin correlation function and plays a complicated role in spin and momenta scattering .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the kane - mele model for a zigzag edge graphene ribbon . @xcite",
    "it has two pieces : @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the usual nearest - neighbor hopping of tight - binding model in graphene @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 is the soc term and @xmath7 is the @xmath8 pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath6 thus has opposite signs for opposite electron spins .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 depend on the orientation of the two nearest neighbor bonds as the electron hops from site @xmath10 to @xmath11 : @xmath12 if the electron makes a left turn to the second bond .",
    "it is negative if it makes a right turn .",
    "@xmath13 is the impurity hamiltonian @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the energy of the impurity orbital and @xmath16 is coulomb repulsion inhibiting the simultaneous occupancy of the orbital by two electrons .",
    "finally @xmath17 describes the hybridization between impurity and one of atoms on the edge ( located at a - sublattice site @xmath18 ) , @xmath19\\texttt{.}\\ ] ]    our principal computational tools are the single - impurity qmc algorithm @xcite for computing the local thermodynamic properties of the impurity and the method of bayesian statistical inference for computing spectral densities .",
    "the qmc naturally returns the imaginary - time green s function @xmath20 of the impurity . with this green s function",
    ", we can easily compute the magnetic quantities on the impurity site such as the expected values of magnet moment square @xmath21 , the double occupancy @xmath22 and the static impurity spin susceptibility @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "computing the imaginary - time green s function also enables us to compute the spectral density @xmath26 by numerically solving @xcite @xmath27 using an extended qmc algorithm , @xcite we can calculate the green s function linking electrons on the impurity site and those in the conduction bands : @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "before we do the qmc simulation , to gain insight of this problem , we map the original hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kma ] ) , to impurity s single - occupancy subspace in the large -@xmath16 limit . defining projection operators , @xcite @xmath30 and",
    "we can solve the effective hamiltonian in single - occupancy subspace as @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then an effective s - d exchange model has the formula as @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ & + & [ j^{\\parallel}_{kk'll'}s^{+}c_{kl\\downarrow}^{\\dag}c_{k'l'\\uparrow}+\\textrm{h.c.}],\\nonumber\\\\ j^{\\perp}_{kk'll'\\sigma}&=&v_{kl\\sigma}^{a}v_{k'l'\\sigma}^{a*}\\left[\\frac{v^2}{u+\\varepsilon_d - e_{k'l'}}+\\frac{v^2}{e_{kl}-\\varepsilon_d}\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ j^{\\parallel}_{kk'll'}&=&v_{kl\\downarrow}^{a}v_{k'l'\\uparrow}^{a*}\\left[\\frac{v^2}{u+\\varepsilon_d - e_{k'l'}}+\\frac{v^2}{e_{kl}-\\varepsilon_d}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the amplitude of eigenstate at @xmath18 on the edge , here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are indexes of momentum and band , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 relates the fermi operators in real space to those in eigen space , @xmath39 @xmath40 is the number of atoms on the edge .",
    "therefore we see that @xmath41 is different from the normal s - d exchange model because of the broken symmetry , @xmath42 , which is due to the helical properties driven by the soc .",
    "later we will see this asymmetry more clearly in the spin - flip scattering .",
    "if we consider that the impurity is mainly scattered by the levels near the fermi level and @xmath43 , there are @xmath44 and @xmath45    in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sdmodel ] ) , the total amplitude of spin exchange depends on the sum @xmath46 , in particular , the elastic exchange is determined by the sum @xmath47 , which is just the density of states ( the degeneracy ) on the level @xmath38 .",
    "[ fig : sd](a ) shows the ldos on the edge and we see that when @xmath48 , a sharp peak exists at the dirac point ( @xmath49 ) suggesting the existence of a strongly localized edge states . when @xmath50 , the central peaks becomes smooth , and at @xmath51 , their values near @xmath49 approach a constant and thus near the dirac point become similar to the ldos in a normal metal .",
    "first , we can expert that since the soc decreases the ldos on the edge , the spin exchange between impurity and conduction electrons will be suppressed .     with different values for @xmath52 .",
    "from top to bottom @xmath53 0 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "( b ) the spin - flip strength @xmath60 as a function of @xmath52 . ]    second , we focus our attention on a special process , elastic backscattering accompanied by spin flip between kramers pair ( @xmath61 ) , in the following we denote this pair as ( @xmath62 ) . in this process ,",
    "the transversal exchange @xmath60 is nonzero , but due to the helical phase on the edge , it has no corresponding vertical term in @xmath41 , and @xmath63 . thus the symmetry in the s - d exchange model ( [ eq : sdmodel ] )",
    "is broken by the soc .",
    "the weight of this spin - flip scattering , @xmath64 , depends on the coupling strength @xmath60 , which is shown as the function of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd](b ) . here",
    "the momentum @xmath65 and @xmath38 is the first band under zero point .",
    "we see that @xmath60 is totally equal to zero in negative regime of @xmath52 but in positive regime has finite value .",
    "this is due to helical properties on the edge : with positive soc , the spin - up and spin - down electrons have momenta @xmath66 and @xmath37 , respectively , so both @xmath67 and @xmath68 have non - zero values but vanishes when @xmath52 changes the sign and the electrons will move along oppositive directions . moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd](b ) we see that the strength of spin flip @xmath60 decreases as the soc increases in the large-@xmath16 limit .",
    "in this section , we will display our qmc results for both local and nonlocal properties for impurity . to see the behavior of local magnetic moment , in fig .",

    "]    with @xmath75 fixed and @xmath71 is near zero point the impurity site is half filled , and thus the magnetic moment is driven by avoiding the possibility of double occupancy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdq](b ) we see that increasing the soc results in the average double occupancy @xmath69 decreasing because the soc suppresses the effective hybridization between impurity and edge states . near the dirac point",
    ", the average local magnetic moments @xmath70 is enhanced by the soc .",
    "we also note that with weak soc , i.e. , @xmath77 , the maxima of @xmath70 are not at @xmath78 while for the large @xmath52 , they are at @xmath78 .",
    "we comment that with small soc the localized states on the edge are antiferromagnetically coupled to impurity states below the fermi energy , so shifting @xmath71 from zero can decouple these oppositely - aligned spin states and lead to the development of a magnet moment .",
    "@xcite contrary to the weak soc case , the strong soc greatly broadens the central peak in ldos on the edge , making the ldos near the fermi energy similar to that of a normal metal .",
    "thus we see that half filling ( hole - particle symmetry ) optimizes the magnetic moment at @xmath78 .    in order to see the formation of local moment and screening around it , we study the dynamical behavior of spin susceptibility in eq .",
    "( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) , in figure  [ fig : tchi ] we shows @xmath79 as a function of temperature for different values of @xmath52 .",
    "we fix the hole - particle symmetry by setting @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "doing so means the average electron occupancy of the impurity site is one ; i.e. , it is half filled .     as a function of @xmath81 for different values of the soc .",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath80 and @xmath78 .",

    "we note that when the soc is gradually switched on , @xmath79 goes cross over form the behavior in zbwa model ( solid line in figure  [ fig : tchi ] ) to that in a normal metal .",
    "@xcite we propose this transition occurs because of the ldos decreased by the soc , consequently , the spin exchange between impurity and conduction electrons is suppressed .     versus @xmath84 .",

    "the impurity states are strongly correlated with the edge states .",
    "there are four peaks .",
    "the inner two stem from the localized edge states which are split by the impurity state .",
    "the outer two peaks stem from the impurity level which are split by the coulomb interaction into @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this four - peak structure is similar to that in zbwa model .",
    "it is known that in zbwa model the separations and weights of two inner peaks are proportional to @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , @xcite but here we can not see this dependence on @xmath16 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aw]b , we show @xmath86 for @xmath85 .",
    "clearly visible is the central kondo resonance and the heights of two inner peaks decreasing with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the expectation that increasing @xmath52 broadens the central peak in ldos , making a singularity become flat band .",
    "we also see that when we increase @xmath16 , the height of the central kondo peak , as well as that of the two inner peaks , decrease , but the heights of the outer two peaks from impurity levels increase .",
    "these behaviors are similar to those of an impurity in a normal metal .",
    "additionally , the two smooth peaks around @xmath92 are remnants of van hove singularities .    from figures  [ fig : tdq ] to  [ fig :",

    "the central resonant in ldos is broadened by the soc , and the region near the dirac point approach a constant . so as the soc is increasing in the system , the impurity coupled to the edge states crosses over from a spin in a band with zero width to one in a normal metal .",
