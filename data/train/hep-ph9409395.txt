    "<S> +    the precise measurement of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 couplings is essential for the confirmation of the non abelian gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) . in this regard , a special role is played by the process @xmath4 at the planned high energy @xmath1 colliders , because in this case deviations from the sm are significantly enhanced by increasing the cm energy , and correspondingly the sensitivity is improved . in general , the trilinear gauge boson interaction includes cp violating couplings as well as cp conserving ones . </S>",
    "<S> the set of measurements sensitive to the cp violating couplings and their separation was discussed in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the possibility of separately constraining the c and p violating ( but cp conserving ) anapole coupling , using process ( [ proc ] ) with initial beams longitudinal polarization , was discussed in ref.@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> since the unpolarized cross section depends on all coupling constants , it should be difficult to separately constrain them using this observable only . to disentangle and limit the couplings in a model independent way one would need more information . </S>",
    "<S> this should be provided by the separate measurements of the cross sections for initial and final states polarizations , which depend on independent combinations of the coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , the three possible @xmath9 polarizations ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , combined with the two longitudinal @xmath13 ones ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) would determine a sufficient set of observable cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this note is to illustrate the role of polarizations to derive model independent bounds on the five anomalous couplings and to quantitatively assess the corresponding expected sensitivities .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic objects are the deviations of the polarized cross sections from the sm values @xmath16 where , in terms of the born @xmath17- , @xmath18- and @xmath19-exchange amplitudes and their deviations from the sm expressions due to the anomalous gauge couplings : @xmath20 in eq.([deltaa ] ) we have distinguished the @xmath19- exchange amplitudes with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the @xmath25 and @xmath26 helicities . with the aid of explicit formulae for </S>",
    "<S> the helicity amplitudes given , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite , one easily finds for the specific initial and final polarizations the following dependence of the amplitudes deviations @xmath27 s in eq.([deltaa ] ) : @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eqs.([deltall])-([deltatt ] ) : @xmath31 , the lower indices @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the final @xmath32 polarizations , the upper indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 indicate the initial @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath14 or @xmath15 polarizations , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the corresponding electron couplings . </S>",
    "<S> one should notice that @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend on the combinations ( @xmath42 ) , ( @xmath43 ) and ( @xmath44 ) respectively .    in order to assess the sensitivity of the different cross sections to the gauge boson couplings </S>",
    "<S> , we define a @xmath45 function as @xmath46 where @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the accuracy experimentally obtainable on @xmath50 . including both statistical and systematical errors , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the integrated luminosity and @xmath54 the efficiency for @xmath9 reconstruction in the considered polarization state . for </S>",
    "<S> that we take the channel of lepton pairs ( @xmath55 ) plus two hadronic jets , which corresponds to @xmath56 @xcite-@xcite .. ] then , as a criterion to derive allowed regions of the coupling constants , we will impose that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a number which specifies a chosen confidence level and in principle can depend on the details of the analysis . in this procedure , an essential role </S>",
    "<S> is played by the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . indeed , for each initial and final polarizations , it is possible to choose the upper and lower integration limits in such a way as to get maximum sensitivity of the corresponding polarized cross sections to the combinations of the coupling constants in eqs.([deltall])-([deltatt ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the search of these ` optimal ' integration regions can be done numerically , by plotting in each case the @xmath45 function ( [ chisquare ] ) _ vs. _ the anomalous couplings for different @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and by looking for the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 which minimize the range of couplings such the inequality @xmath57 holds . to be closer to a possible experimental situation </S>",
    "<S> , we have taken into account that in practice the cross section should be @xmath61,\\label{gcr}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) are less than unity , and represent the actual degrees of longitudinal polarization of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . in the sequel we shall consider as @xmath14 or @xmath15 the simplified situations @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , with @xmath66 as a possible value @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.1 we show an example relevant to the cross sections for unpolarized @xmath67 s and both unpolarized and polarized electrons . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity only the coupling @xmath68 is considered , with all the other ones taken equal to their sm values . </S>",
    "<S> the inputs as well as the resulting optimal kinematical regions are presented in the caption of the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the allowed limits on the values of @xmath68 are at the two standard deviations level ( or 95% cl ) , which for our analysis corresponds to @xmath69 . in this example , as well as in the following analysis , we have taken @xmath70 as currently assumed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of optimal kinematics and of longitudinal initial polarizations is particularly evident in this particular example . </S>",
    "<S> this is connected to the fact that for unpolarized and @xmath15 @xmath71 the relevant angular distribution of @xmath72 in the numerator of eq.([chisquare ] ) has a zero , so that the integration over the whole angular range allowed by an experimental @xmath73 cut ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) would lead to a reduced signal from the anomalous coupling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cross section for final @xmath12 and unpolarized @xmath9 and any initial polarization includes the contribution of the @xmath19-mediated amplitudes with @xmath76 ( see eq.([deltaa ] ) ) , which by far dominates in the forward direction and thus strongly suppresses the signal .    </S>",
    "<S> the general situation regarding the optimal @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the various cross sections , and the corresponding statistical uncertainties , is presented in table 1 for two values of the cm energy and the planned luminosities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .optimal integration regions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( in parentheses ) . </S>",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in conclusion , summarizing the previous analysis , the results obtained show the potential of the approach to derive bounds on the anomalous trilinear boson couplings , based on cross sections integrated with suitably defined cuts and combinations of all possible initial and final polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to separately constrain the @xmath83 conserving couplings in a model independent way with high sensitivity , typically of the order of @xmath84 at @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> particularly stringent bounds can be expected for dynamical models beyond the sm with reduced number of independent couplings .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> , one could include in this kind of analysis also the anomalous coupling @xmath86 , still @xmath83 conserving , which would be induced _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ by a dimension 8 contribution to ( [ lagra1 ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> having , in this case , equal numbers of polarized observables and anomalous couplings , separate constraints could still be found .    </S>",
    "<S> the bounds derived above are approaching the order of magnitude of the radiative corrections to the sm couplings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the next step should be the combination in the fitting procedure of the sm radiative corrections with the anomalous gauge boson couplings .    </S>",
