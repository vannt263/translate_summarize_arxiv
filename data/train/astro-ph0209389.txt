    "recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data analysis suggests an approximately flat universe .",
    "the constraint on the total density parameter , @xmath0 is the ratio between the total energy density and the critical energy density of the universe . ] , obtained from cmb experiments depends on the priors used during the data analysis .",
    "for example with a prior on the hubble parameter and on the age of the universe , recent analysis  @xcite of the dasi , boomerang , maxima and dmr data lead to @xmath1 at 1@xmath2 level and to @xmath3 at 1@xmath2 level if one takes into account only the dasi , boomerang and cbi data . including stronger priors",
    "can indeed sharpen the bound . for instance , including information respectively on large scale structure and on supernovae data leads to @xmath4 and @xmath5 at 1@xmath2 level while including both finally leads to @xmath6 . in conclusion , it is fair to retain that current cosmological observations only set the bound @xmath7 .",
    "these results are consistent with friedmann - lematre universe models with spherical , flat or hyperbolic spatial sections . in the spherical and hyperbolic cases",
    ", @xmath8 implies that the curvature radius must be larger than the horizon radius . in all three cases  spherical , flat , and hyperbolic ",
    "the universe may be simply connected or multiply connected , but our chances of detecting the topology observationally depend strongly on the curvature .",
    "the chances of detecting a multiply connected topology are worst in a large hyperbolic universe .",
    "the reason is that the typical translation distance between a cosmic source and its nearest topological image seems to be on the order of the curvature radius , but when @xmath8 the horizon radius is less than half that distance .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then the radius @xmath12 of the last scattering surface is 0.43 radians ( see eq .",
    "[ chilss ] below ) .",
    "as @xmath0 approaches 1 , @xmath12 approaches 0 radians , which is much less than the typical topology scale , making the topology undetectable ( see e.g. refs  @xcite for some studies on detectability of nearly flat hyperbolic universes ) .",
    "note that , in spite of a widespread myth to the contrary , the topology scale in a hyperbolic 3-manifold might _ not _ depend on the manifold s volume .",
    "it might remain comparable to the curvature radius even for large manifolds , assuming the observer sits at a generic point in the manifold . on the other hand , in the exceptional case",
    "that the observer sits near a short closed geodesic , his or her nearest translated image may be arbitrarily close , even in an arbitrarily large manifold .    in a multiply connected flat universe",
    "the topology scale is completely independent of the horizon radius , because euclidean geometry  unlike spherical and hyperbolic geometry  has no preferred scale and admits similarities .",
    "a great deal of luck would be required for the topology scale to be less than the horizon radius but still large enough to accommodate the lack of obvious local periodicity .",
    "detecting such a topological structure would naturally raise deep questions about this ",
    "topological \" coincidence : why is the topology scale of the order of the size of the observable universe today ?    in a spherical universe",
    "the topology scale depends on the curvature radius , as in the hyperbolic case . luckily , in contrast to the hyperbolic case , as the topology of a spherical manifold gets more complicated , the typical distance between two images of a single cosmic source decreases .",
    "no matter how close @xmath0 is to 1 , only a finite number of spherical topologies are excluded from detection . for example , if @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then @xmath12 = 0.43 radians , and the only excluded topologies are those for which the cyclic factor ( see section  [ sectionclassification ] for explanations ) has order at most @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath0 gets closer to 1 , more topologies are excluded from observation ; nevertheless the chances of observing a spherical universe remain vastly better than the chances of observing a flat universe , because in the flat case only a finite range of length scales are short enough to be observable while an infinite range is too large .",
    "the particular case of the detectability of lens spaces was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which also considers the detectability of hyperbolic topologies ) .",
    "the present paper investigates how the assumption of a nearly flat ( @xmath16 spherical universe affects the strategy for detecting its topology ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews on the different methods and their observational status ) .",
    "we find that the circles - in - the - sky method  @xcite typically detects only a cyclic subgroup of the holonomy group , so the universe `` looks like a lens space '' no matter what its true topology is . if it looks like a globally homogeneous lens space ( generated by a clifford translation  to be defined in section [ sectionclifford ] ) , then the circles - in - the - sky search reduces from a 6-parameter search space to a 3-parameter space ( if the radius @xmath12 of the last scattering surface is known ) or a 4-parameter space ( if @xmath12 is unknown ) .",
    "assuming each parameter is tested at @xmath17 points , the total run time decreases by a factor of @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "if the universe looks like a non globally homogeneous lens space , meaning that a larger subgroup of the holonomy group is detectable , generated by a pair of clifford translations , then the matching circles lie in a 6-parameter space , but with strong constraints on their values , so the search is still much faster than in the general case .",
    "we also note that the crystallographic method s pair separation histogram  @xcite is well suited to detect a topological signal in a nearly flat spherical universe because of the abundance of clifford translations ( defined below ) .",

    "section  [ sectioncircles ] analyzes the circles - in - the - sky method , and section [ sectioncrystallography ] analyzes the crystallographic methods .",
    "spherical 3-manifolds were originally classified by threlfall and seifert @xcite in 1930 .",
    "@xcite reformulates threlfall and seifert s classification in terms of single action , double action , and linked action manifolds .",
    "this latter work also describes the manifolds in each category , and investigates the topological signature of each in the pair separation histogram of cosmic crystallography .",
    "interactive software for visualizing these manifolds may be downloaded at ` www.northnet.org/weeks/curvedspaces ` .",
    "the user flies around in spherical 3-manifolds to gain intuition about their topological properties .",
    "for instance , the role of a cyclic factor ( as described below ) can be well understood with this tool ; screenshots appear in figs .",
    "( [ figurestrings]-[figuresaddlenbr ] ) .    in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the classification given as given in ref .",
    "even though we could follow threlfall and seifert s purely geometric approach , i.e. working with right- and left - handed screw motions , we instead borrow from thurston s approach @xcite and use quaternions to streamline the exposition .",
    "recall that quaternions are like complex numbers , except that while the complex numbers are spanned by two elements * 1 * and * i * satisfying @xmath20 , the quaternions are spanned by four elements elements * 1 * , * i * , * j * , and * k * satisfying the ( non - commutative ) multiplication rules @xmath21 a quaternion @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being real numbers , has length @xmath24 .",
    "the set of unit length quaternions defines the lie group @xmath25 , combining the geometry of the 3-sphere @xmath26 with the multiplicative action of the quaternions , just as the set of unit length complex numbers defines the lie group @xmath27 , combining the geometry of the circle @xmath28 with the multiplicative action of the complex numbers .",
    "each quaternion , @xmath29 , defines one isometry , @xmath30 , by left multiplication @xmath31 @xmath32 another isometry , @xmath33 , can analogously be defined by right multiplication @xmath34 . if @xmath35 is a finite subgroup of @xmath25 , then @xmath36 is a finite group of isometries of @xmath26 ( and isomorphic to @xmath25 ) .",
    "except for the identity , the isometries in @xmath37 have no fixed points , so that @xmath37 defines the holonomy group of a spherical 3-manifold .",
    "the manifolds that arise in this way are called _ single action _",
    "spherical 3-manifolds .",
    "had we used @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 in the definition of @xmath37 we would have obtained the mirror image of the same manifold .",
    "the single action manifolds are in one - to - one correspondence with the finite subgroups of @xmath25 , listed in table [ tables3subgroups ] .",
    "section 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite explains the relationship between these subgroups of isom(@xmath26 ) and the corresponding subgroups of isom(@xmath40 ) , while appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite explicitly determines the elements in each group both as quaternions and as @xmath41-matrices .",
    ".finite subgroups of @xmath25 .",
    "there is a two - to - one homomorphism from @xmath25 to @xmath42 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) so the finite subgroups of @xmath42  the cyclic , dihedral , tetrahedral , octahedral and icosahedral groups  lift to @xmath25 .",
    "each such group lifts two - to - one , giving the corresponding binary group .",
    "only the cyclic groups of odd order lift one - to - one . that is",
    ", each even - order cyclic group @xmath43 arises as the two - fold cover of @xmath44 , while each odd - order cyclic group @xmath45 is the one - to - one lift of @xmath46 .",
    "the binary polyhedral groups are not merely the product of the original polyhedral groups with a @xmath47 factor , nor are they isomorphic to the so - called extended polyhedral groups containing orientation - reversing as well as orientation - preserving isometries ; rather they are something completely new . the plain dihedral , tetrahedral , octahedral and icosahedral groups do not occur as subgroups of @xmath25 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in a single action manifold ( subsection  [ subsectionsingleaction ] ) all holonomies are clifford translations , and thus the topology is potentially detectable if and only if @xmath0 exceeds the minimum value as illustrated in table  [ tablesingleactionpsh ] . in the case of the binary tetrahedral , binary octahedral , and binary icosahedral groups",
    "we would detect equal length translations in several different directions , and could infer the topology exactly . in the case of a binary dihedral group ( assuming @xmath8 ) we would see only the cyclic factor , so in practice we could nt distinguish the binary dihedral group from a cyclic group .",
    "in a double action manifold ( subsection [ subsectiondoubleaction ] ) the psh could detect the factors @xmath35 and @xmath48 individually , subject to the conditions explained in the preceding paragraph , because each is a group of clifford translations , but it could not detect any nontrivial composite elements @xmath49 .",
    "fortunately our nearest translates will typically be clifford translates ( and thus potentially detectable ) even though the vast majority of other translates are not ( cf . figure  [ figurestrings ] ) . only in exceptional cases (",
    "namely when @xmath35 and @xmath48 are cyclic of comparable order , or the observer is at a non - generic location ) might our nearest translates fail to be clifford translates .    in a linked action manifold ( subsection [ subsectionlinkedaction ] ) only a subgroup of each factor",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath48 is available , so it is harder to detect a linked action manifold than a double action one . in some cases , such as the lens space @xmath50 , the available subgroups are trivial and the psh can not detect the topology at all .",
    "fortunately if one excludes the lens spaces then the remaining linked action manifolds are index 2 or index 3 subgroups of the corresponding double action manifolds , the picture is qualitatively the same as in figure [ figurestrings ] , and again the nearest translates are clifford translates , which the psh can detect .",
    "in this article , we have studied the detectability of topology when the universe is spherical but nearly flat , both by the cmb - based circle - in - the - sky method and the large scale structure - based crystallographic method .",
    "spherical topologies turn out to be the most readily detectable . after recalling their geometrical properties",
    ", we first showed that the circles - in - the - sky method typically detects only a cyclic subgroup of the holonomy group , so the universe `` looks like a lens space '' _ no matter what its true topology is_. if it looks like a globally homogeneous lens space , then the circles - in - the - sky search reduces from a 6-parameter search space to a 3-parameter space or a 4-parameter space depending on whether the radius of the last scattering surface is known or not .",
    "if the universe looks like a non globally homogeneous lens space then the matching circles lie in a 6-parameter space , but with strong constraints on their values , so that the search is still much faster than in the general case .",
