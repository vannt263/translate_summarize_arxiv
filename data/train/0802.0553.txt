    "the large difference in catalytic activity of `` ruthenium '' catalysts towards co oxidation under ultra - high vacuum and ambient pressure conditions @xcite has recently been controversially discussed in terms of a possible oxide formation at the surface in technologically relevant environments @xcite .",
    "the well known much lower thermodynamic stability of the bulk oxides of pd or pt @xcite suggests at first glance that this discussion has no direct relevance for these more noble metals that are equally , if not more often used in oxidation catalysis . using a",
    "constrained first - principles thermodynamics approach @xcite we could show in a preceding study @xcite , however , that the situation is not that clear - cut when considering for the possibility of sub - nanometer thin oxide films , so - called surface oxides .",
    "mapping out a wide range of @xmath3-conditions we specifically found for the pd(100 ) surface that the stability range of the well - characterized @xmath0 ( @xmath4 in brevity ) surface oxide structure @xcite does indeed extend up to pressure and temperature conditions relevant for technological co oxidation catalysis @xmath5k , @xmath6atm ) .",
    "this insight motivates to center a detailed kinetic modeling of the surface structure and composition during steady - state co oxidation at technologically relevant pressure conditions on the @xmath4 surface oxide .",
    "more precisely , the question of a possible oxide formation at the surface can be narrowed down to addressing the stability , formation and decomposition of the @xmath4 surface oxide structure in the reactive environment .",
    "theoretically , one is then still faced with the challenge to evaluate the kinetics of the surface elementary processes over time scales of the order of seconds or longer , while accurately accounting for the evolving atomistic structure of the surface . in this study , we meet the time - scale challenge with a first - principles statistical mechanics approach , combining density - functional theory ( dft ) for an accurate description of the kinetic parameters with kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations for the evaluation of the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics problem . at present , such an approach is preferentially carried out on the basis of a lattice model for the surface in order to keep the number of required dft - based parameters tractable . due to the different periodicity and pd - density of the @xmath4 overlayer  @xcite and the pd(100 ) substrate , a combined lattice model",
    "embracing both structures will be highly involved and will require numerous kinetic parameters for a manifold of conceivable atomistic pathways for the complex structural transition between the oxidized and pristine pd surface . before embarking on such an explicit modeling of the formation and decomposition of the surface oxide structure in the simulations",
    "it is thus appropriate to first assess whether the stability range of the @xmath4 surface oxide does indeed extend to the catalytically relevant environments , when the kinetics of the ongoing co@xmath1 formation is fully accounted for . in this study",
    "we determine this stability range by focusing on the onset of the decomposition of the surface oxide structure when the partial pressure ratio @xmath7 exceeds a critical value .",
    "we identify this onset once the average o concentration in the @xmath4 structure is reduced below the value corresponding to the intact surface oxide , which allows us to restrict our kmc modeling to the @xmath4 lattice .",
    "the central result of our kmc simulations , which we had briefly highlighted before @xcite , is that at ambient pressures the surface oxide is stabilized at the surface up to co : o@xmath1 partial pressure ratios just around the catalytically most relevant stoichiometric feeds ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this suggests an interpretation of the morphological changes observed in recent reactor scanning - tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements @xcite under o - rich feeds in terms of a formation of the @xmath4 structure at the surface .",
    "the precise value for the critical partial pressure ratio we compute depends furthermore sensitively on temperature , so that both local pressure and temperature fluctuations may induce a continuous formation and decomposition of the oxidic phase during steady - state operation under ambient stoichiometric conditions .",
    "we therefore expect that a full understanding of the catalytic activity of the pd(100 ) surface in such technologically relevant environments can only be obtained from a modeling that explicitly accounts for the corresponding on - going structural changes , which will then also be able to address the actual role played by the surface oxide for the catalytic activity itself .",
    "nevertheless the rather high peak turnover frequencies obtained in our simulations even at the intact surface oxide show already that the formation of this structure in the reactive environment can not simplistically be equated with a `` deactivation '' of the model catalyst .",
    "our target is to describe the steady - state catalytic co oxidation over the @xmath4 surface oxide by explicitly accounting for the kinetics of the different elementary processes taking place in the system . properly evaluating the time evolution of such",
    "a system requires simulation cells that are large enough to capture the effects of correlation and spatial distribution of the chemicals at the surface .",
    "furthermore , most of the considered processes are highly activated and occur on time scales that are orders of magnitude longer than e.g. a typical vibration ( @xmath8s ) . due to these so - called rare events we need to evaluate the statistical interplay between the different elementary processes over an extended time scale that can reach up to seconds or more .",
    "since this is unfeasible for molecular dynamics simulations , we employ kinetic monte carlo simulations , where the time evolution is efficiently coarse - grained to the rare - event dynamics . in a kmc simulation , each kmc - step corresponds to the execution of a rare event , while appropriately accounting for the short - time dynamics of the system in between . in the generated sequence of system states ,",
    "each state is assumed to be independent of all previous states , i.e. the kmc algorithm provides an efficient numerical solution to the master equation of a continuous time markov process  @xcite .    in order to keep the number of considered elementary processes in a tractable range",
    "the kmc simulations are performed on a lattice .",
    "obviously , the chosen lattice model has to properly reflect the important structural features of the real system . for this model",
    "a list of _ all relevant _ elementary processes @xmath9 on the lattice is set up with the corresponding rate constants @xmath10 that characterize the probability to escape from the present system state by the process @xmath9 . starting in a given initial system configuration the sum over the rate constants of all _ possible _ processes in this current configuration is evaluated , @xmath11 .",
    "one process @xmath12 is then randomly chosen by @xmath13 with @xmath140,1]$ ] being a random number .",
    "since the probability of selecting a process @xmath12 is weighted by its rate constant @xmath15 a process with a large rate constant is more likely to be chosen than a process with a small rate constant .",
    "the selected process is executed and the system configuration is updated . this way the kmc algorithm simulates a sequence of poisson processes and an explicit relationship between kmc time and real time",
    "can be established  @xcite .",
    "this evolution of real time after each kmc step is given by @xmath16 where @xmath170,1]$ ] is a second random number  @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredients to a meaningful kmc simulation are therefore the identification of all relevant elementary processes @xmath9 and the determination of the corresponding rate constants @xmath10 . for the latter we rely on the modern first - principles kinetic monte carlo approach  @xcite and calculate the rate constants using dft and transition - state theory ( tst ) .",
    "concerning the elementary processes during the co oxidation over the @xmath4 surface oxide we consider adsorption , desorption , diffusion and reaction of the chemicals , and follow the recipe of how to determine the rate constants for these processes from dft and tst given in ref .  .",
    "in the next section the resulting expressions for the rate constants are briefly reviewed . the first - principles data required to evaluate the rate constants with these expressions",
    "is then given in section  [ subsec : parameters ] .",
    "the rate constant of adsorption of a gas phase species @xmath12 on a surface site of type @xmath18 depends on the impingement rate and the local sticking coefficient , @xmath19  @xcite @xmath20 the only system - specific parameters entering the impingement rate are the mass @xmath21 of the impinging gas phase molecules and the surface area @xmath22 .",
    "an explicit , accurate evaluation of the local sticking coefficient @xmath19 is highly involved and requires a determination of the full , high - dimensional potential energy surface ( pes ) of the adsorption process , on which molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have to be performed for a statistically relevant number of trajectories  @xcite . in the present study",
    "the local sticking coefficient is instead roughly estimated as  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the highest barrier along the minimum energy pathway ( mep ) and @xmath25 is the so - called active area . within the concept of an active area",
    "it is assumed that only particles of a species @xmath12 with an initial lateral position within a certain area @xmath25 around the adsorption site @xmath18 can actually stick to this site . the rate constant of adsorption in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateads ] ) will then actually become independent of the total impingement area @xmath22 and only the active area @xmath25 has to be known .",
    "@xmath26 is a factor that reduces the number of impinging gas phase particles by the fraction that is not traveling along the mep and might thus be reflected at some higher barrier along a different pathway .",
    "since the desorption process is the time - reversed process of adsorption the desorption rate constants are connected to the adsorption rate constants by the detailed balance criterion and can thus be obtained by applying  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the change in the gibbs free energy between a particle in the gas phase and in the adsorbed state .",
    "@xmath28 is approximated by the difference between the chemical potential of the particle in the gas phase , @xmath29 and the free energy of the particle in the adsorbed state @xmath30 . to evaluate the desorption rate constant using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratedes ] ) we thus need to determine , in addition to the adsorption rate constant , the vibrational partition function of the particle in the adsorbed state , @xmath31 , the temperature and pressure dependent part of the gas phase chemical potential , @xmath32 , as well as the binding energy , @xmath33 of the particle at its adsorption site @xmath18 .      in a diffusion process",
    "a particle @xmath12 moves from a site @xmath18 to a site @xmath34 .",
    "if an appropriate saddle point along the diffusion pathway can be identified , harmonic tst can be applied to obtain the corresponding rate constant of diffusion  @xcite    @xmath35    with @xmath36 and @xmath37    the diffusion barrier @xmath38 denotes the maximum barrier along the mep of the diffusion process and is given by the energy difference of the transition state ( @xmath39 ) and the initial state ( @xmath40 ) at site @xmath18 .",
    "the reverse process of the diffusion @xmath41 is simply the backward diffusion @xmath42 and therefore the rate constants of these two processes have to fulfill the detailed balance criterion . to calculate the diffusion rate constants the factor @xmath43 ( given by the ratio of the vibrational partition functions in the transition state ( ts ) , @xmath44 , and the initial state @xmath31 ) as well as the diffusion barriers have to be known .      if a suitable reaction coordinate can be identified that contains a saddle point , again tst can be used to determine the reaction rate constant . in a general form the reaction rate constant",
    "can then be written as  @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath12 denoting the initial state and @xmath46 the final state of the reaction process .",
    "as for the diffusion events the factor @xmath47 can be obtained from the ratio of the partition functions in the transition and initial state .",
    "in addition the reaction barrier , @xmath48 , defined as the energy difference in the transition and initial state , has to be determined .      the most crucial input parameters to determine the rate constants as discussed in the previous section are the energy barriers for adsorption , diffusion and reaction , as well as the binding energies at a certain adsorption site .",
    "we calculate the total energies that are needed to evaluate these quantities using dft and within the full - potential ( linearized ) augmented plane wave + local orbital ( l)apw+lo method  @xcite as implemented in the code  @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy is treated within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the pbe  @xcite xc - functional . all surfaces are simulated using the supercell approach with inversion symmetric slabs consisting of five pd(100 ) layers with the reconstructed surface oxide layer plus additional o / co on both sides .",
    "we verified that further increasing the number of pd(100 ) layers to seven changes the binding energies of both adsorbates by an insignificant amount ( @xmath49mev per adsorbate ) .",
    "the vacuum between consecutive slabs is at least 14 .",
    "the outermost adsorbate layers , the surface oxide and topmost palladium substrate layer are fully relaxed .",
    "all calculations of gas - phase molecules ( o , co , co@xmath1 ) are done in rectangular supercells with side lengths of @xmath50bohr ( for o ) , @xmath51bohr ( for o@xmath1 and co ) and @xmath52bohr ( for co@xmath1 ) .",
    "the muffin - tin radii are set to @xmath53bohr for palladium , @xmath54bohr for oxygen and @xmath55bohr for carbon . inside the muffin - tins the wave functions",
    "are expanded up to @xmath56 and the potential up to @xmath57 . for the @xmath4 surface unit cell a @xmath58 $ ] monkhorst - pack ( mp ) grid ( 8 irreducible k - points ) has been used to integrate the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and for larger surface unit cells the mp - grid has been reduced accordingly to assure an equivalent sampling of the bz . for the gas - phase molecule calculations in the large rectangular supercells",
    "@xmath59-point sampling was employed .",
    "the energy cutoff for the expansion of the wave function in the interstitial is @xmath60ry and for the potential @xmath61ry .",
    "the chosen computational setup is thus exactly the same as in the preceding thermodynamic study on this system  @xcite . as detailed there  @xcite using these basis set parameters",
    "the reported binding energies per oxygen atom or per co molecule are converged to within 50mev , which is fully sufficient for the arguments and conclusions presented here .",
    "having established the theoretical framework for the kmc simulations the next crucial step is to build a suitable lattice model that represents the investigated system .",
    "for this , we use the insight gained in our preceding constrained thermodynamics study  @xcite that identified the @xmath4 as most relevant oxidic structure under catalytically interesting gas phase conditions ( @xmath62bar , @xmath63k ) .",
    "as initially discussed in section i we thus concentrate the kmc simulations on this particular structure and develop a first - principles kmc lattice model that allows for a proper mapping of the @xmath4 surface oxide structure .      in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a schematic illustration of the surface oxide on pd(100 ) is shown .",
    "the @xmath4 surface oxide structure characterized in uhv corresponds essentially to a ( o - pd - o)-trilayer of pdo(101 ) on top of the pd(100 ) substrate  @xcite .",
    "each @xmath4 surface unit - cell contains four pd atoms in the reconstructed oxide layer . in this stoichiometric termination of the surface oxide two of the pd atoms",
    "are fourfold coordinated and two are twofold coordinated by oxygen .",
    "there are also two kinds of oxygen atoms , two of them sit on - top of the reconstructed pd layer ( upper o atoms ) and two at the interface to the pd(100 ) substrate ( lower o atoms ) forming the previously mentioned trilayer structure .    at first sight",
    "the surface oxide structure exhibits six high - symmetry adsorption sites within the @xmath4 surface unit cell , where either oxygen or co can be adsorbed .",
    "@xcite these are two bridge sites ( br ) , two twofold by oxygen coordinated top sites ( top2f ) and two fourfold by oxygen coordinated top sites ( top4f ) . the difference between each of these doubly existing adsorption sites arises only from the arrangement of the underlying pd(100 ) lattice .",
    "these small structural deviations seem to have little consequences on the binding at these different prominent adsorption sites .",
    "the computed binding energies of o and co in the two bridge sites differ by less than 0.1ev .",
    "similarly for the two top2f and top4f sites the difference is even smaller , @xmath64mev ( a more detailed discussion of the binding energetics can be found in ref .  ) . in our kmc model",
    ", we therefore neglect these small differences and build the lattice from the half sized @xmath4 surface unit - cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , each containing three different adsorption sites , bridge , twofold top and fourfold top .    inspecting the computed energetics at these three different adsorption sites in more detail the kmc lattice model can even be further simplified .",
    "we find that in the top2f and top4f sites the co is bound much weaker , i.e. by @xmath65ev , compared to the bridge site .",
    "in addition , the two top sites correspond only to very shallow pes minima , with diffusion barriers of less than 50mev to a neighboring bridge site . considering further that due to the computed strongly repulsive interactions  @xcite it is not possible to adsorb co at a top site next to an already occupied bridge site",
    ", we realize that the metastable top sites will effectively never be occupied . for oxygen",
    "the situation is even more pronounced , since here the additional adsorption of an o atom at the @xmath4 surface oxide is only possible in the bridge site , whereas the two top sites are not even metastable .",
    "the two different top sites are therefore disregarded in setting up the kmc lattice representation of the surface oxide .    on the other hand , considering only the adsorption into prominent high - symmetry sites at the perfect @xmath4 structure is not sufficient to address the co - induced decomposition of this lattice . for this",
    ", we assume that the surface oxide layer starts to destabilize by the removal of the upper oxygen atoms from the trilayer structure .",
    "we therefore also include the corresponding hollow sites that are completely occupied by these surface oxygen atoms in the perfectly stoichiometric @xmath4 structure as explicit sites in the kmc model , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the basis for the final kmc lattice model is thus formed by the fixed reconstructed pd layer and the lower o atom in the pdo trilayer . on this lattice",
    "there are two different active site types ( br and hol , cf",
    ". left part of the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each site can either be vacant , or filled with one oxygen atom , or one co molecule , whereas multiple adsorption at a site is not possible .",
    "considering all non - concerted processes possible on this lattice we obtain a total number of 26 possible processes .",
    "this includes five adsorption processes , the unimolecular adsorption of co into br or hol sites and the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath1 into adjacent br ",
    "hol or hol  hol sites , as well as the corresponding five desorption processes .",
    "furthermore there are eight site and element specific diffusion processes describing the diffusion of o / co from br@xmath66br , hol@xmath66hol , br@xmath66hol and hol@xmath66br sites , as well as four reaction processes including the reaction of o@xmath67 + co@xmath67 , o@xmath68 + co@xmath68 , o@xmath67 + co@xmath68 and o@xmath68 + co@xmath67 .",
    "since the reaction processes are modeled as associative desorption there are an additional four processes for the dissociative adsorption of co@xmath1 .",
    "this list of non - concerted processes is exhaustive with respect to the chosen kmc lattice setup .",
    "however , it can not be excluded that there might be also other , more complex , concerted processes which could have an influence on the here discussed system .",
    "all kmc simulations are performed on the final lattice model containing @xmath69 half @xmath4 surface unit cells , i.e. 100 br and 100 hol sites , with periodic boundary conditions . to ensure that the size of the chosen lattice is sufficient simulations",
    "were also performed on larger lattices containing up to 1250 br and hollow sites , respectively , without observing significant differences concerning the investigated quantities .",
    "these quantities of interest for the present study are the average surface occupations @xmath70 of a particle @xmath12 on a site @xmath18 under steady - state conditions , which is evaluated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the time step of the @xmath73th monte carlo move . in all simulations we checked carefully using different starting configurations and varying simulation lengths that the system actually reached steady - state , before the average surface occupations were evaluated .      for all 26 processes that are possible in the kmc model ,",
    "the rate constants have to be determined .",
    "the respective expressions for the four different process types , i.e. adsorption , desorption , diffusion and reaction , have been described in section  [ subsec : rates ] . here",
    "we determine the corresponding parameters entering the equations for the different rate constants , following the procedure described in more detail in ref .  .      to calculate the rate constants of adsorption in eq",
    "( [ eq : rateads ] ) we specify the active area @xmath25 for the impingement of each species on each site as simply half the surface area of the surface unit cell in the kmc lattice . as shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] this area corresponds to half the surface unit cell of the @xmath4 structure ( @xmath74@xmath75 ) i.e. @xmath76 for the adsorption of co and @xmath77 for the adsorption of o@xmath1 .    to obtain an estimate for the local sticking coefficient @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sticking ] ) we perform dft calculations to determine first of all if there are any significant barriers , @xmath78 , along the mep for any of the five different adsorption processes . for the co molecule this was done by vertically lifting the co in an upright geometry from a bridge resp . hollow site . for different heights of the co molecule above its adsorption site the energy of the whole system",
    "was then minimized with respect to all other degrees of freedom . for neither of the two sites a barrier was found along this desorption resp .",
    "adsorption pathway , i.e. @xmath79ev . for the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath1 molecules a pes was mapped out in which the energy is given as a function of the bond length between the two o atoms and the height above the surface of their center of mass ( so - called elbow - plot ) . the lateral position of the center of mass within the surface unit cell , as well as the orientation of the o@xmath1 molecule were kept fixed .",
    "since there are only two hollow sites within the @xmath4 surface unit cell a lifting of two oxygen atoms would correspond to a complete removal of all upper oxygen atoms in the surface oxide structure due to the periodic supercell setup of the dft calculations .",
    "therefore , for these calculations the size of the @xmath4 surface unit cell was doubled in the direction of the involved sites .",
    "we find that the dissociation of an o@xmath1 molecule in this particular orientation appears to be non - activated .",
    "a similar result is also found for the o@xmath1 adsorption in neighboring bridge - hollow sites , i.e. @xmath80ev . for the adsorption in two neighboring bridge sites , though , the pes reveals a high barrier of @xmath81ev .",
    "a second parameter entering the sticking coefficient in eq .  ( [ eq : sticking ] ) is the factor @xmath26 representing the reduction in sticking due to the fraction of impinging molecules not following the mep .",
    "since the kmc simulations are performed in a temperature range of @xmath82k , where the impinging gas phase molecules can still be considered as rather slow , it is assumed that the molecules are quite efficiently steered along the mep and thus the value of @xmath26 is approximated by @xmath83 for all five adsorption processes . with these parameters the sticking coefficients are unity for the four barrier - free adsorption processes .",
    "for the activated adsorption of o@xmath1 in two neighboring bridge sites the sticking coefficient is as small as @xmath84 even for a temperature of @xmath85k . even if the crude way of extracting the approximate activation barrier from the restricted elbow plot would thus introduce an error of many orders of magnitude in the sticking coefficient , this adsorption process will therefore still be insignificant compared to the adsorption of o@xmath1 in two neighboring hollow or neighboring bridge and hollow sites .",
    "the results of the kmc simulations reported below where indeed found to be unaffected , even when lowering the activation barrier for this adsorption process by up to 0.5ev .      having determined the five different adsorption rate constants the respective desorption rate constants can be calculated using detailed balance via eq .",

    "the vibrational partition function in the adsorbed state entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratedes ] ) is set to unity , @xmath86 , for all five desorption processes . in the gas phase",
    "this approximation would certainly be reasonable over the here investigated temperature range ( @xmath82k ) , i.e. only the first vibrational state of the o@xmath1 and co molecules is excited . in the adsorbed state , though , this might be changed due to the lower frequency modes resulting from the adsorbate - substrate bond , which could then lead to a somewhat larger partition function , @xmath87 , and therefore slightly smaller desorption rate constants . since this enters only linearly into the desorption rate constant we nevertheless found that considering such increased partition functions did not significantly affect the conclusions drawn from the simulations below .",
    "the temperature and pressure dependent part of the gas phase chemical potential @xmath32 is calculated by approximating the o@xmath1 and co gas phase with ideal gas phase reservoirs and evaluating the translational , vibrational , rotational , electronic and nuclear partition functions using statistical thermodynamics  @xcite .",

    "although we find the kmc simulations to be dominated by adsorption / desorption processes of the reactants ( as anticipated in the constrained thermodynamic approach assuming equilibrium with the gas - phase reservoirs ) , the kinetics of the ongoing oxidation reaction thus still leads to a slight decrease in the stability of the surface oxide . in turn",

    "though almost no reaction processes are detected in the steady - state , since under these conditions the surface is already completely filled with co. then again this corresponds to gas - phase conditions where also in the constrained thermodynamics approach a co covered pd(100 ) surface is the most stable structure ( cf .",

    "similar to the results for @xmath131k the surface oxide structure is completely stabilized for co pressures of @xmath151atm . at a pressure ratio of @xmath162 , i.e. here @xmath163atm , there are still 94% of all hollow sites occupied by oxygen ( solid ( green ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "this result depends , however , critically on the barrier for the reaction of o@xmath125+co@xmath124 .",

    "we can therefore determine the onset of the surface oxide decomposition to fall into the pressure range 0.1atm @xmath166atm . even considering the uncertainties in the reaction rate constants and the limitation to a single kmc lattice , these results agree thus rather nicely with the reactor stm experiments by hendriksen _",

    "furthermore we find that under these feeds the simulated turnover frequencies for the intact surface oxide alone are already of similar order of magnitude as those reported by szanyi and goodman  @xcite for the pd(100 ) surface under comparable gas - phase conditions . while a quantitative comparison is outside the scope of the present work , we note that contrary to the prevalent general preconception at least this particular surface oxide is thus clearly not `` inactive '' with respect to the oxidation of co.",
    "we have employed first - principles kmc simulations to investigate the stability of the @xmath4 surface oxide structure at pd(100 ) against co - induced decomposition under steady - state operation conditions of the co oxidation reaction .",
    "the focus has been particularly set on the thin surface oxide , since this structure was identified as the most stable oxidic `` phase '' under catalytically relevant gas - phase conditions in a preceding constrained first - principles thermodynamics study  @xcite .",
    "the developed kmc model describes the co oxidation on the @xmath4 surface oxide , accounting for all non - concerted processes that are possible on the chosen kmc lattice .",
    "this includes 26 site and element specific adsorption , desorption , diffusion and reaction processes .",
    "the respective kmc rate constants have been obtained from dft total energy calculations together with harmonic transition state theory .    monitoring the onset of the surface oxide decomposition at increasing co pressures , the central result of the kmc simulations is that much in contrast to thicker bulk - like oxide films the stability of the @xmath4 surface oxide can well extend to gas - phase conditions that are relevant for technological co oxidation catalysis . while the accuracy of present - day dft functionals does not permit us to conclude on precise values for the critical co : o@xmath1 partial pressure ratio above which decomposition sets in , our results show undoubtedly that at ambient pressures this ratio is close to the most interesting stoichiometric feed conditions ( @xmath2 ) and will furthermore shift decisively towards more co - rich conditions with increasing temperature .",
    "on the basis of these results we conclude that the surface oxide structure can actually be present under catalytic reaction conditions at ambient pressures and our simulated turnover frequencies indicate that it is then also catalytically active towards the oxidation of co. for the catalytically most relevant feeds the system appears furthermore to be rather close to a transition between the @xmath4 surface oxide structure and a reactant covered pd(100 ) surface . particularly in stoichiometric to slightly o - rich feeds even local fluctuations in both temperature or the reactant partial pressures might then lead to significant local or global changes in the structure and composition of the surface . under steady - state operation conditions oscillations between these two states",
    "are thus conceivable , so that in its active state the catalyst surface might exhibit parts that correspond to pd(100 ) covered by the reactants , as well as by patches of surface oxide , and potentially it is precisely the on - going formation and decomposition of the oxidic structure that is key to understand the catalytic function of this surface under such technologically relevant pressures . for a full understanding of the catalytic co oxidation at the pd(100 ) surface in corresponding environments it thus appears not to be sufficient to concentrate on either the reduced pd(100 ) surface or on an oxidic structure , but both surface states as well as the morphological transition between the two will have to be included in an appropriate model .",
