    "since the discovery of large thermopower with low resistivity in na@xmath2coo@xmath1@xcite , co oxides with the cdi@xmath1-type coo@xmath1 layer such as ca - co - o and bi - sr - co - o have been studied as thermoelectric materials@xcite .",
    "these materials have large thermopower comparable to conventional thermoelectric materials , which is considered to be due to the degeneracy of spins and orbitals@xcite .",

    "the layered rh oxides with the cdi@xmath1-type rho@xmath1 layer are found to have good thermoelectric properties similar to co oxides@xcite , which indicates that rh ions in these rh oxides have similar electronic states to co ions in the layered co oxides@xcite . especially the bi - ba - rh - o compound which is isomorphic to the bi - sr - co - o compound shows pseudogap and negative magnetoresistance@xcite .",

    "k@xmath1co@xmath15 was used as a self - flux . as - grown crystals were removed from the products by washing with distilled water .",

    "compared to @xmath17 of na@xmath2coo@xmath1 , correlation in k@xmath0rho@xmath1 is weak because @xmath17 increases almost linearly with @xmath21 up to 300  k(see eq .",

    "we evaluate the fermi energy of this compound from the slope in the thermopower below 140  k using the following equation@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 represent the elementary charge , the boltzmann constant , and the fermi energy , respectively .",

    "@xmath39 for a two - dimensional system is written as@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 represent the planck constant , the interlayer distance , the carrier concentration , and the effective mass , respectively . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath45  @xmath11 from crystallographic analysis@xcite .",
    "if we adopt @xmath43 evaluated from the composition , we will estimate the effective mass from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) to 80 times larger than the bare mass of electrons .",
    "this value mostly comes from the narrow @xmath46 bands .",
    "the band calculations of nacoo@xmath1 and narho@xmath1 revealed that the electronic states are similar@xcite .",
    "we further note that the calculated band width of narho@xmath1 is comparable to that of curho@xmath1@xcite .",
    "thus the actual band widths of rh oxides can be regarded comparable to those of co oxides .",
    "the mobility is evaluated from @xmath16 to be 3.4  cm@xmath32/v@xmath48s at 300  k , which is comparable to that of na@xmath2coo@xmath1@xcite .",

    "this relation indicates that k@xmath0rho@xmath1 has smaller electron specific heat coefficient @xmath8 than na@xmath2coo@xmath1 , because ot the smaller thermopower slope , which means that the correlation is weaker in rh oxides .",
    "we can also estimate @xmath8 from kadowaki - woods relation(@xmath51  @xmath19cm(mol@xmath48k / mj)@xmath32 ) using the @xmath27 coefficient in @xmath16@xcite .",
    "the estimated values are of the order of @xmath52  j / mol@xmath48k , and reasonably agree .",
    "now we discuss the @xmath21-dependent @xmath18 of k@xmath0rho@xmath1 .",
    "first possibility is that the carrier concentration changes with temperature .",
    "@xmath18 of k@xmath0rho@xmath1 increases with temperature , and changes its sign around 50  k. in the drude model ( free carrier in one band ) , the change in the sign of @xmath18 is unphysical .",
    "second possibility is that there are two kinds of carriers .",
    "the sign of @xmath18 is negative below 50  k , which means that electrons are majority carrier as long as mobilities for electrons and holes are equal .",
    "then the change in the sign of @xmath18 around 50  k indicates that holes are dominant at high temperature .",
    "this behavior is observed in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath53 .",
    "positive @xmath17 with negative @xmath18 in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath53 is ascribed to the ratio of the densities between holes and electrons@xcite , and the @xmath54 has an anomaly around 20  k where @xmath18 changes its sign . in k@xmath0rho@xmath1 ,",
    "no anomalies are detected even in @xmath54 around 50  k , which implies that the two - carrier model is unlikely .",
    "third possibility is that @xmath21-dependent @xmath18 in k@xmath0rho@xmath1 is caused by a special geometry of the crystal structure .",
    "in fact , @xmath21-dependent @xmath18 of triangular- and kagom - lattice systems is theoretically suggested by means of high - temperature expansion formulae@xcite and consistent with experiment@xcite .",
    "koshibae and maekawa suggest that the electronic states in triangular - lattice system of the co oxides are effectively regarded as four interpenetrating kagom lattices@xcite . from the structural similarities ,",
    "layered rh oxides are expected to show such behavior .",
    "the high - temperature @xmath18 of these systems depends on temperature as@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the unit cell volume , the transfer integral , and the electron concentration , respectively .",
    "this indicates that @xmath18 is linear in @xmath21 .",
    "let us apply eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) to k@xmath0rho@xmath1 according to the previous study in bi@xmath59sr@xmath60rho@xmath61@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath21-dependence of @xmath18 of various layered co / rh oxides .",
    "we need to express that the co / rh ions are stable in the low - spin state and the electronic structure should be same in the layered co / rh oxides .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) indicates that @xmath62 dependes on @xmath57 and carrier concentration . in real materials such as ca - co - o and bi - sr - co - o ,",
    "the @xmath21-linear part of @xmath18 has weak relation with carrier concentration@xcite .    to see the relation between the thermopower and @xmath18",
    ", we also put thermopower at 300  k in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the rh oxides show smaller @xmath62 and thermopower than the co oxides@xcite , which may be due to the difference between @xmath64 and @xmath65 orbitals .",
    "the misfit oxides ( nos . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 7 ) have @xmath21-independent thermopower at 300  k , which has been explained by the heikes formula .",
    "since the heikes formula is independent of the band width @xmath57 , @xmath62 has little to do with the magnitude of @xmath66 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) shows that the carrier concentration dependence of @xmath18 is almost independent of @xmath58 where the carrier concentration is nearly half ( @xmath67 ) , and accordingly the four - times difference in @xmath62 between na@xmath68coo@xmath1 and k@xmath0rho@xmath1 is ascribed to the difference in @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , the estimated @xmath57 s from these @xmath62 in na@xmath68coo@xmath1 and k@xmath0rho@xmath1 are @xmath6925  k@xcite and @xmath69160  k , respectively .",

    "<S> we report measurements and analyses of resistivity , thermopower and hall coefficient of single - crystalline samples of the layered rh oxide k@xmath0rho@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity is proportional to the square of temperature up to 300  k , and the thermopower is proportional to temperature up to 140  k. the hall coefficient increases linearly with temperature above 100  k , which is ascribed to the triangular network of rh in this compound . </S>",
    "<S> the different transport properties between na@xmath2coo@xmath1 and k@xmath0rho@xmath1 are discussed on the basis of the different band width between co and rh evaluated from the magnetotransport . </S>"
