    "various approaches of quantum gravity , such as , string theory ( st ) , doubly special relativity ( dsr ) , black hole physics ( bhp ) predict that there should exist a minimum length scale of the order of the planck length ( @xmath2 ) , or , in other words , the existence of a maximum energy scale in nature .",
    "this prediction motivates to modify the heisenberg s uncertainty principle to some generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) in the context of the quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the gup model that has been proposed from string theory and black hole physics contains the existence of minimum measurable length , whereas dsr provides a gup model which incorporates the existence of a maximum observable momentum .",
    "this maximum momentum scale has been obtained in the context of dsr theory for the consideration of the frame independent invariant upper bound of energy scale into the theory @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the above two scenarios , the minimum length scale and the maximum momentum scale can be combined into a single deformed uncertainty principle ( dup ) , which has the dual nature @xcite .",
    "however , the modified heisenberg s algebra that can be generated from this dup relation is not relativistically covariant .",
    "hence , it is very difficult to apply the dup in any relativistic scenario .",
    "so , here we mainly concentrate on the relativistically covariant modified heisenberg s algebra , which is constructed from the gup model that incorporates the minimum length scale only . indeed , later on",
    ", we will see that this modified algebra deforms the coordinate representation of the momentum operator , whereas the position operator remains undeformed .",
    "on the other hand , standard general relativity ( gr ) is not enough to describe the phenomena that recently appeared in astrophysics and cosmology , such as , the late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite . an easy way to explain",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe is to consider an additional fluid which has a negative equation of state parameter ( dark energy ) ; this new fluid counteracts the gravitational force , and leads to the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "the simplest dark energy candidate is the cosmological constant @xmath3 leading to the @xmath3cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , this model has two serious problems : the fine tuning problem @xcite , and the coincidence problem @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "different dark energy models gave rise into existence , and try to explain the recent accelerating phase of the universe , such as , time - varying @xmath4 cosmologies , quintessence , k - essence , phantom and others ( for instance see @xcite ) .    now , it is known from cosmic microwave background observations , that our universe had gone through the inflationary phase at its early stage , and then entered into the radiation , and matter dominated eras , in which the expansion became decelerating .",
    "so , at the early stage of high energy regime , it was accelerating , and , in this present low energy regime , it is again accelerating .",
    "quantum gravity effects played an important role at the early universe , see for instance @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mystery behind the origin of magnetic fields with @xmath5 g ( microgauss ) strength @xcite ( having approximately the same energy density as the cosmic microwave background radiation ) observed in the intergalactic scales , has some explanation in the context of gup @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a minimum length , specifically gup , * * prevent the complete evaporation of black holes @xcite .",
    "in particular it has been shown that a black hole with temperature greater than the ambient temperature should radiate photons , as well as , ordinary particles until it reaches the planck size , whereas in the planck scale , it stops radiating , and , its entropy reaches zero @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it will be very interesting to investigate whether the gup corrected modified theory can explain the present day accelerating phase , or , not . because , these theoretical approaches predict that the minimum length effects are quite universal at any stage .",
    "hence , they must have to describe the late time accelerating phase in order to keep the consistency in the theory .",
    "since , it is known that the dark energy , is the proposed candidate to explain the present day acceleration ; so , we can study the consequences of the gup modification on the dark energy models .",
    "we have already mentioned that the modified heisenberg s algebra corresponding to the gup model that incorporates the existence of minimum length , modifies the coordinate representation of momentum operator . as a consequence , the dispersion relation of momentum become modified and finally the klein - gordon equation deforms accordingly . from this modified klein - gordon equation",
    "one can easily expect the deformation of a lagrangian density in field theory .",
    "as , in the context of dark energy we have a field theoretic model , namely , the quintessence scalar field models which is bounded as follows  @xmath6 , and could describe the acceleration of the universe when @xmath7 . ] @xcite , so , we can modify it in light of gup . therefore , in order to study the late - time acceleration of the universe , in this work , we are interested on the scalar field models ( quintessence ) in which the lagrangian has been modified by the gup .",
    "note that , for this lagrangian the gravitation equations follows from the einstein - hilbert action with the usual variational principle .    from the analysis of the recent data",
    "@xcite it appears that the eos parameter for the dark energy could have values @xmath8 .",
    "the limit @xmath9 is called phantom divide line or phantom barrier . as , the usual quintessence scalar field model can not explain this phase , so , our another motivation is to modify the scalar field model in such a way that it can explain the recent phase .",
    "indeed , here we will show the modified model will drag a correction term into the effective equation of state parameter @xmath10 , and it concludes that , @xmath10 can cross the above phantom barrier .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in section [ gupmd ] ,",
    "we give the basic definitions and properties of gup and we derive the modified klein - gordon equation . in section [ fequa ] , we consider a quintessence scalar field cosmology follows from gup .",
    "we use lagrange multiplier and we write the gravitational action as that of two scalar field cosmology with a mixed kinetic term .",
    "furthermore , we consider a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime and write the field equations and the modified eos . in section [ cosmoevol ] , we write the field equations in the dimensionless variables , the dynamical system which arises is a slow - fast dynamical system , where we study the fixed points of the system in the slow manifold . furthermore , we perform numerical simulations for two well known scalar field potentials",
    ". finally , in section [ discu ] , we draw our conclusions .",

    ", we have the modified klein gordon equation has the following form@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the laplace operator , whereas for the metric @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in contrary with the classical klein - gordon equation in equation ( [ kg.01 ] ) , there is the term @xmath36 , which is the quantum correction term .",
    "furthermore , we remark that equation ( [ kg.01 ] ) is a fourth - order singular perturbed equation .",
    "equation ( [ kg.01 ] ) could arise from a variational principle , that is , there exists a function @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 , where @xmath39is the euler lagrange operator .",
    "the lagrangian of the fourth - order klein - gordon equation has the following expression @xcite,@xmath40 where the new operator @xmath41 is @xmath42;@xmath43 is the covariant derivative , i.e.@xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",

    "note that , the last term of the above action ( [ ac.04 ] ) can be written equivalently as follows @xmath58    the action integral ( [ ac.04 ] ) provide us with a higher - order theory of gravity in which the higher - order terms follow from the term @xmath59 .    in order to simplify the calculations ,",
    "we introduce a lagrange multiplier , and , consider the new variable @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 ; therefore , incorporating the lagrange multiplier @xmath62 into ( [ ac.05 ] ) , and by solving the lagrange s equation @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 . hence , applying integration by parts , equation ( [ ac.05 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath65    therefore , the gravitational action ( [ ac.04 ] ) becomes @xmath66 in which ,   @xmath67\\ ] ] the last action describes a field which is coupled with the field @xmath68 , where the extra term follows from the perturbation effects of gup .    finally , from action ( [ ac.08 ] ) , we have that the gravitation equations@xmath69are @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the energy - momentum tensor for the two fields @xmath72 , and , @xmath73 is the energy- momentum of the matter component .",
    "we remark that the kinetic metric which is defined by the two fields @xmath72 can not be written in a diagonal form , since the coordinate  transformation @xmath74 which diagonalizes the kinetic metric depends on @xmath75 , i.e. it is singular transformation . which means that the action ( [ ac.08 ] ) can not be written in that of the quintom model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the second fluid @xmath60 , is not a real fluid but it follows from the higher - order derivatives of the field equations .    in particular , the reduction of the order of the field equations from a fourth - order theory to a second - order , by using a lagrange multiplier , it means that in the same time the number of the dependent variables is increased .",
    "an other analogue is the @xmath76-gravity in the metric formalism @xcite .",
    "the last gravitational theory for nonlinear @xmath76 function is reduced with the use of the lagrange multiplier in a brans - dicke theory with vanished brans - dicke parameter @xcite , the so called ohanlon massive dilaton theory @xcite . for other applications of lagrange multipliers in different theories of gravity ,",
    "see @xcite , and for a discussion on the degrees of freedom in alternative theories of gravity , see @xcite .    in the following section we continue with the derivation of the field equations in a spatially flat flrw spacetime .",
    "let us consider a spatially flat flrw spacetime with line element @xmath77 and , with gravitational action ( [ ac.08 ] ) , where the matter tensor @xmath78 describes a dust fluid with energy density @xmath79 . moreover , from the conservation law @xmath80 ( bianchi identity ) , and , for the space ( [ frw.01 ] ) , we have that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the present value of the energy density . from the cosmological principle",
    ", we have that the fields @xmath72 inherit the symmetries of the metric ( [ frw.01 ] ) , hence , @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , for the space ( [ frw.01 ] ) , the gravitation equations ( [ einstein ] ) follow from the following lagrangian ] @xmath84    lagrangian ( [ ac.09 ] ) can be seen as the lagrangian of a particle moving in a riemannian manifold with metric @xmath85 and effective potential @xmath86 , that is , @xmath87 where , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is given by the following line element@xmath90    for the euler - lagrange equations of ( [ ac.10a ] ) we have that these are given by the following expression@xmath91 where @xmath92 are the christoffel symbols of @xmath89 , and the nonzero christoffel symbols are @xmath93 and@xmath94    therefore from ( [ ac.10c])-([ac.10e ] ) , we have that the second friedmann s equation which is the euler - lagragne equation of ( [ ac.09 ] ) with respect to the scale factor , @xmath95 is given as follows @xmath96 and the klein - gordon equations for the two field  @xmath72 , are @xmath97 which follow from the conservation law @xmath98 furthermore , the first friedmann s equation can be seen as the hamiltonian function which follows from lagrangian ( [ ac.09 ] ) , and it is ) can be derived from the euler - lagrange equation with respect to a new variable , @xmath99 which arises from the lapsed time @xmath100 , for instance see @xcite.],@xmath101    here , we would like to note that , the set of the field equations ( [ ac.10])-([ac.12b ] ) form a singular perturbation dynamical system .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to prove that , equation ( [ ac.12a ] ) is the constrained equation @xmath102 , and , if we replace @xmath60 from ( [ ac.12a ] ) in ( [ ac.12b ] ) , then we will have a fourth - order equation , which is the modified klein - gordon equation for the field , @xmath68 , in gup . furthermore , in the limit in which @xmath103 , that is , the deformation parameter @xmath13 is vanished and we have the classical uncertainty principle , lagrangian ( [ ac.09 ] ) is that of quintessence scalar field with dust fluid , and in the same time equations ( [ ac.11])-([ac.12b ] ) reduced to the field equations for the last model .",

    "we have shown that , for an exponential potential , the outer solution of the field equations admits only unstable fixed points , which correspond to the matter dominated era , the radiation epoch , and , to the solution where the universe is dominated by the kinetic part of the scalar field . for large  values of the lapse time , we demonstrate that the cosmological parameters are constants .",
    "finally , we have performed numerical simulations of the field equations for two well known potentials @xmath250 in both cases , the eos parameter @xmath0 can take values lower than minus one .",
    "that result is important , since we can have a phantom behavior which follows for the quantum corrections of a quintessence scalar field model .",
