    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , though it can fit most of the present data , leaves a few fundamental problems unsolved , one of which is the gauge hierarchy problem . since the second revolution of string theories , a crop of models with extra dimensions have been proposed to solve various theoretical problems . in an attractive model of large extra dimensions or tev quantum gravity ( add model ) @xcite , the fundamental planck scale can be as low as a few tev .",
    "this is made possible by localizing the sm particles on a brane ( using the idea of d - branes in type i or ii string theory ) , while gravity is free to propagate in all dimensions .",
    "the observed planck scale ( @xmath5 gev ) is then a derived quantity .",
    "extensive phenomenology studies have been carried out in recent years .",
    "signatures for the add model can be divided into two catergories : sub - planckian and trans - planckian .",
    "the former is the one that was studied extensively , while the latter just recently received more attention , especially black hole production in hadronic collisions .",
    "a black hole ( bh ) has been illusive for decades , as we can not directly measure any properties of it , not to mention the production of black holes in any terrestrial experiments .",
    "this is due to the fact that in order to produce black holes in collider experiments one needs a center - of - mass energy above the planck scale ( @xmath6 gev ) , which is obviously inaccessible at the moment .    in models of large extra dimensions ,",
    "the properties of black holes are modified and interesting signatures emerge @xcite . the fact that the fundamental planck scale is as low as tev also opens up an interesting possibility of producing a large number of black holes at collider experiments ( e.g. lhc ) @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite showed that a bh localized on a brane will radiate mainly in the brane , instead of radiating into the kaluza - klein states of gravitons of the bulk . in this case , the bh so produced will decay mainly into the sm particles , which can then be detected in the detector .",
    "this opportunity has enabled investigation of the properties of bh at terrestrial collider experiments .",
    "there have been a number of such studies @xcite at hadronic colliders .",
    "a typical signature of the bh decay is a high multiplicity , isothermal event , very much like a spherical  fireball . \" on the other hand , bh production has also been studied in cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) serve as a very energetic beam hitting on the atmosphere as the target .",
    "the primary ingredient of uhecr is probably protons or light nuclei , or could be photons or even neutrinos .",
    "if it is made up of protons , it could produce a large number of bh s up at the top of the atmosphere , producing a giant air shower .",
    "if it is neutrinos , it could produce very interesting horizontal air showers @xcite , or black holes within a km - sized neutrino telescope @xcite .",
    "an important quantity of a bh is its entropy @xmath7 . to fulfill the thermodynamical description , a bh requires a large entropy of order of 25 @xcite .",
    "such an entropy requirement implies that the bh mass must be at least five times the fundamental planck scale @xcite .",
    "this mass requirement makes the bh production not as large as previously calculated in a number of works @xcite , first pointed out in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , the signature of large multiplicity decay of a bh can only happen when the entropy is large . even taking into account this mass requirement , the event rate is still large enough for detection . on the other hand , there were arguments from voloshin that the cross section should be multiplied by an exponential factor @xmath8 @xcite ( we shall get back to this point later in sec .",
    "however , this suppression factor becomes too severe for the production rate to be interesting , contrary to the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , because of the large entropy requirement .",
    "there have been continuous theoretical efforts to calculate the production and decay of bh s in particle collisions @xcite .",
    "other interesting trans - planckian phenomena include string balls @xcite , @xmath0-branes @xcite , and tev string behaviors @xcite . dimopoulos and",
    "emparan @xcite pointed out that when a bh reaches a minimum mass , it transits into a state of highly excited and jagged strings  a string ball ( sb ) .",
    "the transition point is at @xmath9 where @xmath1 is the string scale and @xmath3 is the string coupling .",
    "naively , sb s are stringy progenitors of bh s .",
    "the bh correspondence principle states that properties of a bh with a mass @xmath10 match those of a string ball with @xmath11 .",
    "we can then equate the production cross sections of sb and bh at the transition point .",
    "in fact , we shall use this argument to write down the cross section for the sb at the transition point .",
    "the existence of string balls could be argued from the string point of view .",
    "when the energy of the scattering reaches the string scale , the scattering of particles is no longer described by point - particle scattering but replaced by string - string scattering .",
    "as the energy goes further up , the strings become highly excited , jagged and entangled string states , and become like a string ball .",
    "when the energy reaches the transition point , it turns into a bh .",
    "previously , in the discussion of a bh , we mentioned a large entropy requirement on the bh in order for the object to be a bh .",
    "such a large mass requirement makes the production cross section smaller than previously thought . here in the case of sb s ,",
    "the mass requirement is substantially lower , thus the production rate is significantly higher .",
    "hence , an sb is more interesting in the experimental point of view if it decays with a distinct signature .",
    "dimopoulos and emparan @xcite argued that the decay of a sb is similar to that of a bh , i.e. , a high multiplicity decay into the sm particles , though in some intermediate stages the sb decays more likely into bulk particles .",
    "another interesting trans - planckian object is the @xmath0-brane .",
    "a bh can be considered a @xmath12-brane . in particle collisions , if one considers bh production , one should also consider @xmath0-brane production .",
    "in fact , the properties of @xmath0-branes reduce to those of a bh in the limit @xmath13 . in extra dimension models ,",
    "in which there are large extra dimensions and small extra dimensions of the size of the planck length , let a @xmath0-brane wrap on @xmath14 small and @xmath15 large dimensions .",
    "it was found @xcite that the production of @xmath0-branes is comparable to bh s only when @xmath16 , i.e. , the @xmath0-brane wraps entirely on the small dimensions only . if @xmath17 , the production of @xmath0-branes would be suppressed by powers of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fundamental scale of the @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "therefore , here we only consider the case in which @xmath16 .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 branes is not well understood .",
    "one interesting possibility is cascade into branes of lower dimensions until they reach the dimension of zero . whether the zero brane is stable depends on the model .",
    "another possibility is the decay into brane and bulk particles , thus experimentally the decay can be observed . or it can be a combination of cascade into lower - dimensional branes and direct decays .    in this work , we study the production rates of the bh s , sb s , and @xmath0-branes in hadronic collisions , with emphasis on the lhc and the vlhc .",
    "the organization is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the relation between the fundamental planck scale and the string scale . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the production of bh s , sb s , and @xmath0-branes . in sec .",
    "iv , we show our numerical results for the lhc and vlhc .",
    "we discuss the decays in sec .",
    "v and conclude in sec .",
    "first let us address more clearly the configuration of the space - time .",
    "let there be @xmath21 total extra dimensions with @xmath22 small extra dimensions and @xmath23 large extra dimensions .",
    "when we say small extra dimensions , we mean the size is of order of @xmath24 , the fundamental planck scale .",
    "the observed 4d planck scale @xmath25 is then a derived quantity given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the volumes of the extra @xmath22 and @xmath23 dimensions , respectively , given by @xmath29 where we have expressed the lengths @xmath30 in units of planckian length @xmath24 . where @xmath31 is the radius of the torus .",
    "] suppose the small extra dimension has the size of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , then @xmath34 the fundamental planck scale @xmath19 is lowered to the tev range if the size @xmath35 is taken to be very large , of order @xmath36 .",
    "the relation of the observed planck scale to the string scale @xmath1 is given by @xcite @xmath37 where we again take the small extra dimensions of size @xmath32 . from eqs .",
    "( [ nm ] ) and ( [ nmm ] ) we can relate the string scale with the fundamental planck scale as @xmath38 where we take the proportional constant of order @xmath39 , which depends on different compactification configurations .",
    "we shall also use the more conventional definition of the fundamental planck scale @xmath4 related to @xmath19 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gravitational constant in @xmath42 dimensions ( used in the einstein equation : @xmath43 ) .",
    "then @xmath4 is related to the string scale @xmath1 as @xmath44 for a constant @xmath45 of order @xmath39 . in the next section",
    "we shall simply use @xmath46 for discussions and cross - section calculations .",
    "a black hole is characterized by its schwarzschild radius @xmath47 , which depends on the mass @xmath48 of the bh . a simplified picture for bh production is as follows . when the colliding partons have a center - of - mass ( c.o.m .",
    ") energy above some thresholds of order of the planck mass and the _ impact parameter _",
    "less than the schwarzschild radius @xmath47 , a bh is formed and almost at rest in the c.o.m .",
    "the bh so produced will decay thermally ( regardless of the incoming particles ) and thus isotropically in that frame .",
    "this possibility was first investigated for the lhc in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , black hole production in hadronic collisions is calculated in @xmath49 subprocesses : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are incoming partons . the black hole so produced is either at rest or traveling along the beam pipe such that its decay products ( of high multiplicity ) have a zero net transverse momentum ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "giddings and thomas @xcite and dimopoulos and landsberg @xcite demonstrated that a bh so produced will decay with a high multiplicity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out the `` @xmath53 '' subprocesses , such that the bh is produced with a large @xmath52 before it decays .",
    "the `` @xmath53 '' subprocesses can be formed when the c.o.m .",
    "energy of the colliding particles is larger than the bh mass ; the excess energy will be radiated as other sm particles . ) , and everything , including the `` extra partons , '' will be hidden behind the horizon .",
    "thus , the entire energy is contained within the bh , which is considered a quantum state rather than a particle . in this picture",
    ", there is no transverse momentum given to the bh , unless by the initial - state radiation of the incoming partons .",
    "this was already studied by a monte carlo approach in ref .",
    "] in such subprocesses , the `` others '' are just the ordinary sm particles and usually of much lower multiplicity than the decay products of the bh . therefore , the signature is as follows : on one side of the event there are particles of high multiplicity ( from the decay of the bh ) , the total @xmath52 of which is balanced by a much lower number of particles on the other side .",
    "such a signature is very clean and should have very few backgrounds .",
    "the next natural question to ask is how large the event rate is .",
    "collider phenomenology is only possible if the event rate is large enough , especially if we want to study bh properties .",
    "it was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the bh production rate is so enormous that the lhc is in fact a bh factory .",
    "however , this has not taken into account the entropy factor of the bh .",
    "it was shown in ref . @xcite",
    "that with a large entropy requirement ( @xmath54 ) the bh production rate decreases substantially , but still affords enough events for detection .",
    "for example , the production cross section is as high as 1 pb for @xmath55 tev and @xmath56 with @xmath57 at the lhc .",
    "this implies @xmath58 events with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath59 . of course , if we relaxed this entropy constraint , the production cross sections would be increased tremendously , but the cross sections have to be interpreted with care because of the presence of large string effects in this regime .",
    "the schwarzschild radius @xmath47 of a bh of mass @xmath48 in @xmath20 dimensions is given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is introduced for convenience and @xmath4 is the fundamental planck scale in the model of large extra dimensions already defined in eq .",
    "( [ m*-md ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath47 is much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "bh production is expected when the colliding partons with a center - of - mass energy @xmath62 pass within a distance less than @xmath47 .",
    "a black hole of mass @xmath48 is formed and the rest of the energy , if there is any , is radiated as ordinary sm particles . this semiclassical argument calls for a geometric approximation for the cross section for producing a bh of mass @xmath48 as @xmath63 in the @xmath49 subprocess , the c.o.m .",
    "energy of the colliding partons is just the same as the mass of the bh , i.e. , @xmath64 , which implies a subprocess cross section @xmath65 on the other hand , for the @xmath66 subprocesses the subprocess cross section is @xmath67    another important quantity that characterizes a bh is its entropy given by @xcite @xmath68 the variation of @xmath7 versus the ratio @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sbh ] . to ensure the validity of the above classical description of a bh @xcite ,",
    "the entropy must be sufficiently large , of order 25 or so . from the figure we can see that when @xmath70 , the entropy @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , to avoid getting into the nonperturbative regime of the bh and to ensure the validity of the semiclassical formula , we restrict the mass of the bh to be @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is of order 5 .",
    "voloshin @xcite pointed out that the semiclassical argument for the bh production cross section is not given by the geometrical cross - section area , but , instead , suppressed by an exponential factor , @xmath74^{\\frac{n+2}{n+1 } } \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{s_{\\rm bh}}{n+1 } \\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] there are , however , counter arguments @xcite that the simple geometric formula should be valid . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have considered both forms of cross sections : the naive @xmath75 and the @xmath75 multiplied with the exponential factor of eq .",
    "( [ supp ] ) .",
    "the suppression factor renders the cross section too small for detection , because the exponential factor contains the entropy @xmath7 , which has to be sufficient large ( e.g. , @xmath76 ) to define a black hole .",
    "the suppression is more than two orders of magnitude and , therefore , we shall not be concerned with this suppression factor anymore .",
    "this seems to contradict the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which rizzo concluded that even when voloshin s suppression factor is included , the cross section is still large enough , because he did not impose a large entropy requirement on the validity of the bh .",
    "if he had done so , he would also have gotten a very large suppression .",
    "nevertheless , careful interpretation is needed if the bh has only a small entropy .",
    "dimopoulos and emparan @xcite pointed out that when a bh reaches a minimum mass , it transits into a state of highly excited and jagged strings , dubbed string ball .",
    "they are the stringy progenitors of bh s and share some properties of bh s , such as large production cross sections at hadronic supercolliders and similar signatures when they decay .",
    "they made an important observation @xcite that the minimum mass @xmath77 ( the transition point ) above which a bh can be treated general - relativistically is @xmath2 , where @xmath1 and @xmath3 are the string scale and the string coupling , respectively .",
    "below this transition point , the configuration is dominated by string balls .",
    "since the mass of a string ball is lower than a bh , the corresponding production cross section is larger than that of a bh .",
    "thus , at the lhc , string ball production may be more important .    according to the bh correspondence principle",
    ", the properties of a bh with a mass @xmath10 match those of a string ball with a mass @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the production cross section of a string ball or a bh should be smoothly joined at @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 the production cross section for string balls with mass between the string scale @xmath1 and @xmath80 grows with @xmath81 until @xmath80 , beyond which , due to unitarity , it should stay constant .",
    "therefore , we can use the bh cross section and match to the string ball cross section at the transition point @xmath2 .",
    "this string ball cross section then stays constant between @xmath80 and @xmath2 .",

    "the evaporation rate is governed by its hawking temperature , given by @xcite @xmath163 which scales inversely with some powers of @xmath48 .",
    "the heavier the bh , the lower is the temperature .",
    "thus , the evaporation rate is slower .",
    "the lifetime of the bh also scales inversely with the hawking temperature as given by @xmath164 from the above equation , it is obvious that the lifetime of a bh becomes much longer in models of large extra dimensions than in the usual @xmath165 theory .",
    "however , the lifetime is still so short that it will decay once it is produced and no displaced vertex can be seen in the detector . for another viewpoint on the bh decay",
    ", please see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an important observation is that the wavelength @xmath166 of the thermal spectrum corresponding to the hawking temperature is larger than the size of the bh .",
    "this implies that the bh evaporates like a point source in @xmath81-waves , therefore it decays equally into brane and bulk modes , and will not see the higher angular momentum states available in the extra dimensions .",
    "since on the brane there are many more particles than in the bulk , the bh decays dominantly into brane modes , i.e. , the sm particles in the setup .",
    "furthermore , the bh evaporates ",
    "blindly \" into all degrees of freedom . the ratio of the degrees of freedom for gauge bosons , quarks , and leptons is @xmath167 ( the higgs boson is not included ) .",
    "since the @xmath168 and @xmath169 decay with a branching ratio of about 70% into quarks , and the gluon also gives rise to hadronic activities , the final ratio of hadronic to leptonic activities in the bh decay is about @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "another important property of the bh decay is the large number of particles , in accord with the large entropy in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , in the process of evaporation .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the average multiplicity @xmath171 in the decay of a bh is order of @xmath172 for @xmath48 being a few times @xmath4 for @xmath173 .",
    "since we are considering the bh that has an entropy of order 25 or more , it guarantees a high multiplicity bh decay .",
    "the bh decays more or less isotropically and each decay particle has an average energy of a few hundred gev .",
    "therefore , if the bh is at rest , the event is very much like a spherical event with many particles of hundreds of gev pointing back to the interaction point ( very much like a fireball ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bh is produced in association with other sm particles ( as in a @xmath174 subprocess ) , the bh decay will be a boosted spherical event on one side ( a boosted fireball ) , the transverse momentum of which is balanced by a few particles on the other side @xcite .",
    "such spectacular events should have a negligible background .",
    "highly excited long strings emit massless quanta with a thermal spectrum at the _",
    "hagedorn _ temperature .",
    "( the hagedorn temperature of an excited string matches the hawking temperature of a bh at the corresponding point @xmath175 . )    at @xmath176 , the wavelength @xmath166 corresponding to the thermal spectrum at the hagedorn temperature is larger than @xmath177 .",
    "this argument is very similar to that of the bh , and so the string ball radiates like a point source and emits in @xmath81-waves equally into brane and bulk modes . with many more particles ( sm particles ) on the brane",
    "than in the bulk , the sb radiates mainly into the sm particles .",
    "when @xmath178 goes below @xmath2 , the sb has the tendency to puff up to a _ random - walk size _ as large as the @xmath166 of the emissions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it will see more of the higher angular momentum states available in the extra dimensions .",
    "thus , it decays more into the bulk modes , but it is only temporary .",
    "when the sb decays further , it shrinks back to the string size and emits as a point source again @xcite .",
    "most of the time the sb decays into sm particles . on average",
    ", a sb decays into invisible quanta somewhat more often than a bh does .",
    "high multiplicity decay of the bh should also apply to the sb , at least when the mass of the sb is close to the correspondence point @xcite .",
    "naively , we expect that if the sb mass decreases , the multiplicity will decrease .",
    "thus , the signature of the sb is very similar to the bh , except that it may have lower multiplicity .",
    "the decay of @xmath0-branes is not well understood , to some extent we do not even know whether it decays or is stable . nevertheless , if it decays one possibility is the decay into lower - dimensional branes , thus leading to a cascade of branes . therefore , they eventually decay to a number of @xmath12-branes , i.e. , bh - like objects .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that when the @xmath0-branes decay , their masses might not be high enough to become bh s .",
    "therefore , the final @xmath12-branes might be some excited string states or string balls . whether the zero brane is stable or not depends on models .",
    "another possibility is decay into brane and bulk particles , thus experimentally the decay can be observed . or it can be a combination of cascade into lower - dimensional branes and direct decays . since the size @xmath106 is much smaller than the size of the large extra dimensions , we expect @xmath0-branes to decay mainly into brane particles .",
    "however , the above is quite speculative .",
    "in this work , we have calculated and compared the production cross sections for black holes , string balls , and @xmath0-branes at hadronic supercolliders ( lhc and vlhc ) .",
    "provided that the fundamental planck scale is of order of 1 to a few tev , large numbers of bh , sb , and @xmath0-brane events should be observed at the lhc . at the vlhc ( @xmath179 tev ) ,",
    "the events rates are enormous .",
    "we have also given rough estimates for the sensitivity reaches on the fundamental planck scale @xmath4 at various @xmath125 , based on the number of raw events .",
    "the sensitivity of bh and @xmath0-brane production is roughly 2 tev at the lhc , @xmath180 tev for @xmath152 tev , @xmath181 tev for @xmath155 tev , @xmath182 tev for @xmath158 tev , and @xmath183 tev for @xmath161 tev .",
    "finally , we offer a few comments as follows .    1 .   the production cross sections for bh estimated in this work are significantly smaller than others in the literature , because we have imposed a stringent entropy @xmath7 requirement on the bh .",
    "such a requirement is necessary to make sure the object is a bh . had",
    "this requirement relaxed , the cross section would have increased substantially . for the purpose of comparing with others results , we also show the cross sections for smaller values of @xmath184 in table [ table - y ] .",
    "the cross sections listed for @xmath185 should be interpreted with care , because the smaller the ratio @xmath186 the stronger the string effect is and the classical description for bh may not be valid . 2 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that a bh with an angular momentum @xmath187 is likely to be formed in particle collisions when the incoming partons are collided at an impact parameter . in such a case , the radius of the bh decreases and thus the naive cross - section formula @xmath188 implies a smaller cross section for each angular momentum @xmath187",
    ". the higher the angular momentum , the larger is the suppressions .",
    "nevertheless , when all @xmath187 ( including @xmath189 ) are summed , the total cross section gives a factor of @xmath190 enhancement to the case of nonspinning bh .",
    "@xmath0-brane production is negligible if @xmath191 , because of the large volume factor suppression .",
    "but when @xmath16 ( the @xmath0-brane wraps entirely on the small extra dimensions of the size of the planck length ) , the production cross section is sizable .",
    "moreover , the cross section is a few times larger than the bh production for the case of @xmath192 , where @xmath193 .",
    "the production cross section for sb s is enormous because it does not suffer from a mass threshold as large as for the bh .",
    "the minimum mass requirement is between @xmath1 and @xmath80 .",
    "we typically choose @xmath119 as the starting point for the sb .",
    "such a large event rate makes the tests for string ball properties and bh correspondence principle possible . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , since only a very small fraction of the decay products of a bh has missing energies , the mass of the bh can be determined .",
    "moreover , the energy spectrum of the decay products can be measured and fitted to the black - body radiation temperature .",
    "thus , the hawking radiation relationship between the mass and temperature of a bh can be tested . here ,",
    "similar to the bh , both the mass and the temperature of the sb can be determined by measuring the spectrum of the decay products .",
    "thus , the relationship between the mass of the sb and the hagedorn temperature can be tested .",
    "we have emphasized the importance and the advantages of using the @xmath120 subprocess for production of bh s , sb s , and @xmath0-branes , which allows a substantial transverse momentum kick to the object , and at the same time produces an energetic high @xmath52 parton , which provides a critical tag to the event . 6 .   at the lhc and vlhc , multiparton collisions and overlapping events",
    "may be likely to happen .",
    "a careful discrimination is therefore necessary , especially in the case in which the bh is produced at rest or is moving along the beam - pipe ( i.e. , in @xmath49 subprocess ) .",
    "the @xmath120 subprocess affords an easier signature experimentally .",
    "the high @xmath52 parton emerging as a jet , a lepton , jets , or leptons provides an easy tag .",
    "7 .   in this study",
    ", we do not consider the difference in the decays of bh , sb , and @xmath0-brane .",
    "if we could distinguish the decay signatures of the bh and sb , we might be able to test the bh correspondence principle at the transition point .",
    "we can also test the decays of @xmath0-branes in more detail .",
    "there just appears a short review article @xcite on bh production at hadronic colliders and by ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos .",
