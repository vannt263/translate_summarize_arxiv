    "in the field of artificial intelligence , neuro - fuzzy refers to combination of artificial neural networks and fuzzy logics trying to use benefits of these two fields .",
    "perhaps the most important advantage of neural networks is their adaptivity .",
    "adaptivity comes from learning capability of neural networks which allows these networks to perform well even when the environment varies over time like what human brain does .",
    "another significant benefit of neural networks relates to their huge connectivity ( again inspired from real brain ) that offers high fault tolerance and parallel processing power which is also assumed to be the reason of high efficiency of biological systems . on the other hand , fuzzy logic performs an inference mechanism under cognitive uncertainty and provides an inference morphology that enables approximate human reasoning capabilities to be applied to knowledge - based systems .",
    "however , in fuzzy inference systems , it usually takes a lot of time to design and tune membership functions and rules . to overcome this problem , similar to what is done in neuro - fuzzy systems ,",
    "learning techniques of neural networks can automated this tuning process to reduce development time .",
    "therefore , it can be said that current neuro - fuzzy systems like anfis @xcite , rulenet @xcite and garic @xcite are fuzzy systems that use a learning algorithm derived from neural network theory to determine their parameters ( fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules ) by processing training data .",
    "however , eventually all of these neuro - fuzzy systems are trying to approach an ideal soft - computing tool where the nature of its computing or inference be as similar as possible to computation and inference in human brain .",
    "although now we can see significant progresses in this area in the software domain , samples of successful hardware which could even approach computing capabilities of real brain are very rare .",
    "one of the main obstacle in front of this purpose relates to the ability of efficiently modeling and construction of synapses .",
    "actually , highly parallel processing power of biological systems comes from large connectivity between neurons through synapses ( each neuron in human brain is connected to about 10000 other neurons through these synapses ) and it is widely believed that the adaptation of synaptic weights enables the biological systems to learn and function .",
    "therefore , efficient construction of synaptic weights is a critical factor in the success of final system .",
    "after the first physical realization of memristor @xcite , it becomes clear that this passive element can be a perfect representative of synapse since similar to synapse , its conductance can be precisely modulated by passing charge and flux through it .    in the past few years and by the discovery of memristor and improvements achieved in the construction of powerful digital hardware , extensive works are in progress to build an artificial brain that can adaptively interact with the world in real time . among",
    "then we can name projects like ifat 4 g at john hopkins university , brainscales in the european union s neuromorphic chip program , brain simulator c2 introduced by ibm , and modular neural exploring traveling agent ( moneta ) .",
    "the most recent one between these projects , _",
    "i.e. _ moneta which is the part of the darpa s synapse program , is a software developed by the researchers at boston university which will run on a brain - inspired microprocessor under development at hp labs in california @xcite . in this still under construction system , in spite of internal structure of real brain ,",
    "all units are implemented in digital with separate memory and computational units .",
    "however , it has been argued that by constructing memristive memories ( to store synaptic weights ) and putting them very close to computational circuits that read and write them , signalling losses and power consumption can be minimized @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce another approach to construct a simple neuro - fuzzy computing system which differs significantly from other systems in this category .",
    "in fact , we believe that structures similar to what is proposed in this paper merit more to be called neuro - fuzzy compared to currently available systems .",
    "this is because of the fact that as can be seen in the rest of the paper , in our proposed system neural network and fuzzy logic fields are completely involved with each other and it is hard to distinguish that which part belongs to fuzzy logic and which part relates to neural networks .",
    "moreover , there is no use of exact mathematical techniques . as another advantage , in this system memristor crossbar",
    "is used to store synaptic weights but by this difference that memory is assimilated with computational units like what we have in human brain .",
    "in addition , because of large connectivity between input and output neurons , this proposed structure is completely fault - tolerant .",
    "actually we have shown that even if during the fabrication process or execution phase of the system near half of the memristors become faulty , system can still continue working satisfactory .",
    "on the other hand , learning in our structure is based on the creation of fuzzy relations which is shown to be equal to primary hebbian learning rule and therefore all synaptic weights will be always non - negative .",
    "however , in spite of almost all developed learning methods , there is no need to precisely adjust these weights which are represented by memristors .",
    "finally , our neuro - fuzzy system is hierarchically expandable and since it is constructed with analog circuits , its computations are almost in real - time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "inference method in our proposed neuro - fuzzy system is described in section [ neurofuzzy ] .",
    "section [ hardware ] is devoted to the explanation of the hardware implementation of proposed inference method based on memristor crossbar structure .",
    "the reason that we have considered our proposed system as a neuro - fuzzy one is presented in section [ reason ] .",
    "eventually , a few experimental results are presented in section [ simulation ] , before conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper we propose a new fuzzy structure with biological support which can do some inferential tasks in fuzzy form .",
    "in addition , this fuzzy structure has learning capability like human brain but in spite of neural networks , it performs any operation based on concepts of fuzzy logic .",
    "this means that in our proposed structure , inputs and outputs of the structure are fuzzy numbers and any calculation in the structure for doing inferential processes is done in fuzzy without using any precise and accurate mathematical techniques .",
    "figure [ figa:1 ] shows such a typical single input single output ( siso ) system where in this system , fuzzy input and output variables are considered to be discrete for simplicity .",
    "if this system was a non - fuzzy system , its input or output would be a single crisp number .",
    "however , since this system is a fuzzy one , its input and output should be fuzzy numbers or set of pairs like what is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figa:1 ] . since the construction of this system with this kind of input and output terminals is impossible ( from hardware aspect )",
    ", we modify input and output terminals of the fuzzy system of fig.[figa:1 ] such as the one presented in fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] . in this figure ,",
    "i_th input and the _ j_th output of the system represent concepts @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "note that resolution or domain of input or output variables can be increased by adding input or output terminals to the system where each of these newly added terminals will represent new values of input or output variables .",
    "now , if in the system of fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] , the input applied to the _",
    "i_th input terminal which represents concept @xmath0 be @xmath2 ( @xmath3 : membership function of input fuzzy number ) and the output at the _",
    "j_th output terminal which represents concept @xmath1 be @xmath4 ( @xmath5 : membership function of output fuzzy number ) , the system of fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] will be equal to the fuzzy system of fig .",
    "[ figa:1 ] but by this difference that the construction of the fuzzy system shown in fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] is much simpler .",
    "consequently , input of the system of fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] is a vector of membership degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath6 $ ] , and the output of this system is also a vector of membership degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath7 $ ] where combination of these membership grades with those concepts which are assigned to input and output terminals creates input and output fuzzy numbers . as a result",
    ", we again have a totally fuzzy system with fuzzy input and fuzzy output variables .",
    "for example , consider a typical fuzzy system shown in fig .",
    "[ figa:3 ] . in this example",
    ", input of the system is a fuzzy number @xmath8 which can be roughly considered as a fuzzy representation of crisp number @xmath9 and the output of this system for this input is a fuzzy number @xmath10 where its deffuzzification may probably result in a crisp number @xmath11 .",
    "now , let s see how the fuzzy inference system of fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] which relates the fuzzy input variable to fuzzy output variable can be constructed .",
    "it is well known that the compositional rule of inference describes a composition of a fuzzy set and a fuzzy relation .",
    "any fuzzy rule in the form of @xmath12 is usually represented by a fuzzy relation @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "having given input linguistic value @xmath14 , we can infer an output fuzzy set @xmath15 by the composition of the fuzzy set @xmath14 and the relation @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , doing any inference between fuzzy input and output variables requires a fuzzy relation @xmath13 between these variables .",
    "each fuzzy relation can be represented by a surface which we call it _ fuzzy relation surface _ or frs .",
    "value of this surface at any point is from a kind of membership degree and therefore will be always non - negative . in literature ,",
    "several implication methods have been proposed to construct a fuzzy relation based on given input and output fuzzy sets @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show another method to construct fuzzy relation based on available training fuzzy data when input and output fuzzy sets are not known . as can be seen in the rest of this paper , our proposed method has the ability of learning as well .",
    "figure [ figa:4 ] shows one typical frs for the fuzzy system of fig . [ figa:3 ] .",
    "note that since input and output variables of the fuzzy system of fig .",
    "[ figa:3 ] are discrete , this surface has became discrete as well .",
    "one reason that we have made input and output of this system and consequently its representing fuzzy relation discrete is that the hardware implementation of continues fuzzy system is very difficult if not impossible . as stated before , it is evident that based on the requirements of the application that this fuzzy system is intended for , resolution and range of its corresponding discrete fuzzy relation ( surface ) can be increased simply by increasing the number of input and(or ) output terminals of the system .    in its simplest form",
    ", any fuzzy relation can be defined as follows @xcite :    let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be two universes of discourse . binary fuzzy relation , denoted by @xmath13 , are fuzzy sets which map each element in the product set @xmath18 to a membership grade @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "so any fuzzy relation can be expressed as : @xmath22    now the problem is to determine the membership function of the fuzzy relation @xmath13 based on given input and output fuzzy sets . in this section",
    ", two different situation will be considered : ( i ) input and output fuzzy sets are available and ( ii ) input and output fuzzy sets are not in hand but instead of them , some fuzzy input - output training data are available .",
    "consider that input fuzzy set @xmath23 with membership function @xmath24 and output fuzzy set @xmath25 with membership function @xmath26 are available and the goal is to determine the membership function of the fuzzy relation described by : @xmath27 based on the knowledge of @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a fuzzy implication scheme . here , we consider a new and simple implication method defined as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 can be any monolithically increasing function .",
    "note that since we are dealing with fuzzy systems , function @xmath32 does not need to be defined precisely .",
    "equation [ eqfr ] says that the membership value of the constructed fuzzy relation at any point @xmath33 should be directly proportional to the sum of the values of the input s membership function at point @xmath34 and the output s membership function at point @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , whatever both values of input and output membership functions at points @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively be higher , the membership value of fuzzy relation @xmath13 at point @xmath33 should be higher as well .",
    "although this implication method is not similar to other common methods , it has this benefit that as can be seen later , its hardware implementation is straightforward .",
    "now , consider the case in which input and output fuzzy sets are not available but we want to construct a fuzzy relation based on @xmath36 existing fuzzy input - output training data .",
    "each fuzzy input - output training data for any siso system consists of two fuzzy numbers : input fuzzy number denoted by @xmath14 and output fuzzy number denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the _ i_th fuzzy training data can be considered as @xmath37 where : @xmath38    in above equations , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are universes of discourse and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are membership functions of fuzzy numbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "similar to what is done in previous subsection , we propose to construct a fuzzy relation representing the relation between input and output fuzzy variables as : @xmath43    however , when all training data are not entirely available at the beginning or when they are entering one by one , fuzzy relation can be formed iteratively . in this case ,",
    "entrance of any new data should update the current fuzzy relation which its updating rule can be written as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the newly observed fuzzy input - output training data . here",
    "it is worth to discuss a bit more about our proposed method to construct fuzzy relation based on fuzzy training data .",
    "actually , this implication method is inspired from the ink drop spreading concept in active learning method @xcite because of three reasons : ( i ) it has biological support , ( ii ) its hardware implementation is very simple and ( iii ) it does not obey from exact mathematical techniques .",
    "figure [ figfuzrelcreation ] shows this process graphically . in this figure ,",
    "fuzzy relation is interpreted as an image where in this image the intensity of the pixel at location @xmath46 is directly proportional to @xmath19 and pixels with higher intensity are depicted darker . when a new training data is being observed , the value of the fuzzy relation at any point like @xmath46 should be increased ( should be made darker ) .",
    "however , increasing amount of fuzzy relation at point @xmath46 should be proportional to membership grades of observed input and output fuzzy numbers at points @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively . since most of naturally created fuzzy numbers have bell like shapes ( gaussian - like membership functions ) , updating the fuzzy relation due to this new fuzzy input - output training data can be equated with the distillation of one ink drop and then spreading it on the image representing this fuzzy relation .",
    "this process is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figfuzrelcreation ] as well . in a similar way ,",
    "updating the fuzzy relation with the next fuzzy input - output training data will be equal to dropping another ink drop on the fuzzy relation image .",
    "as individual ink drop patterns overlap , the overlapping area become increasingly darker .",
    "the effective radius of distilling ink drop on the image is to somehow related to the amount of uncertainty in measuring input and output numbers .",
    "for example , when we can measure input and output data with infinite precision , they will become simple crisp numbers and therefore the radius of distilling ink drop should approach zero .        gradually by the entrance of more and more data ( by progressing in the learning process and spreading more data ) , a pattern will be formed on this image . finally , this pattern will represent the fuzzy relation which connects input and output fuzzy variables .    to conclude , any fuzzy inference needs a fuzzy relation which in its simplest form can be represented by a 2-dimensional matrix ( like the one shown in fig . [ figfuzrelcreation ] ) .",
    "consequently , any fuzzy inference hardware that one would like to propose should at least have a structure for storing and manipulating matrixes .      in this section , we explain how inference is done in our proposed method . for this purpose , assume that fuzzy relation is created and based on this relation and given input fuzzy number , we want to determine corresponding output fuzzy number . in literature , several different approaches have been proposed to design fuzzy inference systems having linguistic descriptions of inputs and outputs @xcite",
    ". however , most of these inference systems have this disadvantage that their hardware implementation is not simple .",
    "for example , consider _ min _ and _ max _ operators which are frequently in use in fuzzy inference systems .",
    "it is well known that their hardware implementation is not efficient compared to some other t - norm or t - conorm operators .",
    "therefore , it is evident that the construction of large scale systems like human brain based on these inference methods is very hard if not impossible . actually , this is because of the fact that these operators are not inherently consistent with the physical behavior of circuit elements . to avoid this problem",
    ", we propose a new but unusual inference method as described below .",
    "suppose that we have a fuzzy relation @xmath13 and input fuzzy number @xmath47 .",
    "now , we propose to compute the membership function of output fuzzy number @xmath15 corresponds to the input fuzzy number @xmath14 as : @xmath48 where @xmath17 is the universe of discourse of output fuzzy number @xmath15 .",
    "if we refer back to our proposed structure shown in fig .",
    "[ figa:2 ] and consider the input of the structure as a vector of membership grades like @xmath49^t$ ] , in this case output of that structure can be written as : @xmath50^t=\\mathbf{\\mu_r}\\times\\mathbf{\\mu}_{a'}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a transposition operator and @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , our proposed inference method is nothing else than a simple vector to matrix multiplication .",
    "this process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figinfab ] graphically in two cases : ( i ) input of the system is a crisp number and ( ii ) input of the system is a fuzzy number .",
    "note that to have better understanding , fuzzy relation in this fuzzy system is considered to be continuous .",
    "figure [ figinfaa ] shows that when the input of the fuzzy system is a crisp number , like @xmath0 ( @xmath53 is equal to 2 in fig .",
    "[ figinfaa ] ) , output of the system which is acquired by our proposed inference method will be the curve ( representing output fuzzy number ) of intersection of the fuzzy relation with the plane @xmath0 multiplied by @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ figinfbb ] shows the other case in which the input of the system is a fuzzy number .",
    "however , without loos of generality and to better illustrate the concept behind our inference method , input fuzzy number is considered to be discrete with only two non - zero samples at points @xmath55 and @xmath56 with membership grades of @xmath2 and @xmath57 respectively . when this input is applied to the structure , output fuzzy number @xmath15 will be the weighted sum of two fuzzy numbers obtained by intersecting of the fuzzy relation with planes @xmath0 and @xmath58 which can be written as : @xmath59 where @xmath60    this equation means that each sample of input fuzzy number creates a distinct output fuzzy number which is the curve of intersection of the fuzzy relation with the specific plane .",
    "then , these fuzzy numbers are aggregated ( summed ) with each other with different gains to create the output fuzzy number ; as the membership grade of one sample in fuzzy input number be higher , contribution of its corresponding fuzzy number in the creation of final output fuzzy number will be more .",
    "therefore , our proposed inference method ( eq . [ eqinfmul ] or eq . [ eqcomp ] ) which is only a simple vector to matrix multiplication is not so much irrelevant and illogical .",
    "note that since multiplying the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqinfexam ] by a constant will not change the output fuzzy number ( its defuzzification before and after this multiplication will result in a same crisp number ) , the height of the output fuzzy number does not need to be equal to 1 .    in the following sections",
    ", we will show how this proposed inference method can be simply implemented by using memristor crossbar structure . in addition , the reason that made us to consider this system as a neuro - fuzzy one will be explained as well .",
    "in this section , at first physical properties of the forth circuit element _",
    "i.e. _ memristor will be discussed and then the working procedure of memristor crossbar and its application will be explained . finally , we will show that how the fuzzy inference system that we developed in previous section can be implemented with this memristor crossbar structure .",
    "after the first experimental realization of the forth fundamental circuit element _",
    "i.e. _ memristor @xcite whose existence was previously predicted in 1971 by leon chua @xcite , extraordinary increased researches are in process in variety of fields like neuroscience , neural networks and artificial intelligence .",
    "it has become clear that this passive element can have many potential applications such as non - volatile memory construction @xcite , creation of analog neural network and emulation of human learning @xcite , building programmable analog circuits @xcite , constructing hardware for soft computing tools @xcite , implementing digital circuits @xcite and in the field of signal processing @xcite .",
    "memristor , different from other electrical elements namely resistor , capacitor and inductor , denotes the relationship between flux(@xmath61 ) and electric charge ( @xmath62 ) as @xcite : @xmath63    by rewriting this equation , memristance of the memristor can be expressed as : @xmath64 which shows that the unit of memristance is ohm .",
    "in fact , a memristor can be thought of as a resistive device that its resistance varies in dependence of its current or flux .",
    "memristor is an electrically switchable semiconductor thin film sandwiched between two metal contact with a total length of @xmath65 and consists of doped and un - doped regions which its physical structure with its equivalent circuit model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "the internal state variable @xmath66 determines the length of doped region with low resistance against un - doped region with high resistivity .",
    "this internal state variable and consequently the total resistivity of the device can be changed by applying external voltage bias @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "if the doped region extends to the full length @xmath65 , the total resistance of the device will be at its lowest level denoted as @xmath68 and if the un - doped region extends to the full length @xmath65 , the total resistance of the device will be at its highest level namely @xmath69 .",
    "for example , the mathematical model for the total resistance of the memristor reported by hp can be written as @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the initial state for state variable @xmath66 , @xmath72 is the average ion mobility and @xmath73 is the amount of electric charge ( integral of current ) that has passed through the device . above equations",
    "show that passing current from memristor in one direction will increase the memristance of the memristor while changing the direction of the applied current will decrease its memristance .",
    "in addition , it is obvious that in this element , passing current in one direction for longer period of time ( which means @xmath73 has higher absolute value ) will change the memristance of the memristor more .",
    "moreover , by setting the passing current into zero , the memristance of the memristor will not change anymore .",
    "finally , note that determining the memristance of the memristor at any time can be done by passing a small current through the memristor and measuring the dropped voltage across it ( see eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) .    as a result , memristor is nothing else than the analog variable resistor where its resistance can be adjusted by changing the direction and the duration of the applied voltage .",
    "therefore , memristor can be used as a storage device in which analog values can be stored as a memristance instead of voltage or charge . here",
    "it should be emphasized that memristor - based storage devices have some advantages compared to those storage devices which use capacitors . at first ,",
    "the former can be fabricated much denser than the later one through the nano - crossbar technology @xcite .",
    "second , memristor can hold the stored data unchanged theoretically for an infinite period of time without refreshing @xcite . finally , unlike capacitors",
    ", memristors can be used in the memristor crossbar structure which has so many potential applications ( one of them is demonstrated in this paper ) .",
    "a crossbar array basically consists of two sets of conductive parallel wires intersecting each other perpendicularly .",
    "the region where a wire in one set crosses over a wire in the other set is called a crosspoint ( or junction ) .",
    "crosspoints are usually separated by a thin film material which its properties such as its resistance can be changed by controlling the voltage applied to it .",
    "one of such materials is memristor which is used in our proposed crossbar - based circuits in this paper .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a typical memristor crossbar . in this circuit ,",
    "memristors which are formed at crosspoints are depicted explicitly to have better visibility . in this crossbar ,",
    "memristance of any memristor can simply be changed by applying suitable voltages to those wires that memristor is fabricated between them .",
    "for example , consider the memristor located at coordinate ( 1 , 1 ) ( crossing point of the first horizontal and the first vertical wires ) of the crossbar .",
    "memristance of this memristor can be decreased by applying a positive voltage to the first vertical wire while grounding the first horizontal one ( or connecting to negative voltage ) .",
    "dropping a positive voltage across the memristor will cause the current to pass through it and consequently , the memristance of this passive element will be decreased . in a similar way",
    ", memristance of this memristor can be increased by reversing the polarity of applied voltage .",
    "as stated before , application of higher voltages for longer period of time will change the memristance of the memristor more .",
    "this means that the memristance of any memristor in the crossbar can be adjusted to any predetermined value by the application of suitable voltages to the specific row and column of the crossbar .",
    "however , here it should be emphasized that in this paper , there will be no need to adjust the memristance of the memristors accurately and only increasing or decreasing the memristance of the memristor will be sufficient .",
    "to summarize , memristor crossbar is a 2-dimensional grid that analog values can be stored in its crosspoints through the memristance of the memristors .",
    "consequently , it seems that the memristor crossbar is a perfect structure to construct and store 2-dimensional patterns like fuzzy relations . in this case",
    ", vertical and horizontal wires of the crossbar will represent different discrete values of input and output variables respectively and memristors in crosspoints will have the role of entries of 2-dimensional matrixes representing fuzzy relations .    against these mentioned advantages ,",
    "memristor crossbar structure has some drawbacks .",
    "first of all , reading the memristance of the memristors at any point of the crossbar is partly difficult .",
    "but the second and the most important disadvantage of memristor crossbar structure relates to the inherent physical limitation of memristor . as stated before ,",
    "memristance of the memristor can be between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , it seems that storing analog values through the memristance of the memristors needs a linear mapping from input space to interval @xmath76 $ ] . in the next section ,",
    "we show how these problems can be solved by slightly modifying the structure of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and how this structure can be used to construct and store fuzzy relations .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the memristor crossbar - based analog circuit that we have proposed to construct fuzzy inference system introduced in previous section .",
    "as can be seen later , this structure has biological support and can be considered as a single - layer fuzzy neural network which conforms with the hebbian learning rule but with very new interesting properties compared to today s conventional neural networks .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] consists of a simple crossbar that each of its rows is connected to the negative input terminal of a simple opamp . through these opamp - based circuits added to rows of the crossbar we will be able to read the pattern stored in the crosspoints of the crossbar . since these opamps have a fixed resistor with resistance @xmath69 ( maximum memristance value of the memristors used in the crossbar ) as a feedback , combination of each of these opamps and those memristors which are connected directly to the same horizontal wire that opamp is connected to it creates a simple opamp - based summing circuit .",
    "note that in the uppermost row of the crossbar , instead of memristor , a resistor with resistance @xmath77 is fabricated in each crosspoint .",
    "since this row of the crossbar is connected to an opamp with a feedback resistor @xmath77 , it again forms a simple inverting summing circuit that adds inputs of the crossbar with the same gain _",
    "i.e. _ -1 . therefore , at any time output of this summing circuit , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 , can be written as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the input signal ( represented by voltage ) connected to the _ j_th vertical wire of the crossbar and @xmath81 is the number of columns of the crossbar .",
    "note that the hat sign in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] is used to distinguish inputs and outputs of the structure from those concepts which are assigned to rows and columns of the circuit .",
    "the reason of using this summing circuit will become clear in the rest of this section .",
    "now , by applying standard opamp circuit analysis techniques , output voltage of the opamp connected to the _ i_th row of the crossbar can be expressed as : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the current memristance of the memristor at coordinate @xmath84 of memristor crossbar and @xmath85 is the number of rows of the crossbar .",
    "note that to write this equation , memristor is treated like a simple resistor .",
    "this is true only when the memristance of the memristor be almost constant during the calculation of output voltages .",
    "this can be guaranteed by applying input voltages @xmath86 ( for @xmath87 ) to columns of the crossbar for very short period of time during the execution phase .",
    "another condition that this structure should satisfy is that the memristance of all memristors in the crosspoints of the crossbar should initially be equal to @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , in all of our proposed structures in this paper , storing any value at coordinate @xmath84 of the crossbar is done by decreasing the initial memristance of the memristor located at this coordinate by the given value . in other words ,",
    "current stored value at coordinate @xmath84 denoted by @xmath88 can be written as : @xmath89    by this trick , there will be no need to use linear mapping as mentioned in previous section .",
    "by substituting [ eq6 ] and [ eq4 ] into [ eq5 ] we will get : @xmath90    now , by assuming that the stored value in every crosspoint is always much smaller than @xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath91 , which can be satisfied by scaling data before storing , eq .",
    "[ eq6 - 1 ] can be simplified to : @xmath92 or equivalently can be expressed in matrix form as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 $ ] , @xmath96^t$ ] , and @xmath97 .",
    "it is evident that although we will use this structure for performing fuzzy operations , any matrix multiplication in the form of eq .",

    "this is because of the fact that memristance of the memristor will remain fixed theoretically for an infinite period of time when there is no applied voltage or current .",

    "for this purpose , it is sufficient to behave as follows :    for @xmath135 repeat these steps :    * connect membership grades of fuzzy number @xmath41 and the negative of membership grades of fuzzy number @xmath42 to their corresponding columns and rows of the crossbar respectively .",

    "entrance of any new training data simply updates the stored pattern .",
    "hence , by presenting more training data to the structure , gradually a pattern ( fuzzy relation ) will begin to form on the crossbar .    here , three important aspects of this described procedure should be emphasized .",
    "first , @xmath108 should be decreased by the increase of @xmath36 to satisfy the condition @xmath136 .",

    "creating fuzzy relation based on crisp data is possible either by using large number of training data to form a pattern or by converting crisp training data to their corresponding fuzzy numbers before applying them to the structure ( for example by using gaussian membership function ) .",
    "the third and the most important note pertains to how to create voltages corresponding to membership grades of input and output fuzzy numbers and how to apply(remove ) them to(from ) inputs and outputs of the structure . as will be demonstrated in the section of simulation results as well ,",

    "the neuromorphic paradigm is attractive for nanoscale computation because of its massive parallelism , potential scalability , and inherent defect- and fault - tolerance @xcite . in biological systems ,",
    "the synaptic weights between neurons can be precisely adjusted by the ionic flow through them and it is widely believed that the adaptation of synaptic weights enables biological systems to learn and function . however , before the first physical realization of memristor , experimental construction of these neuromorphic systems which consist of neurons and synapses , especially in the electronic domain , has remained somewhat difficult .",
    "the primary problem was the lack of a small and efficient circuit that can emulate essential properties of synapses namely : having low power consumption , ability to be fabricated in high density ( human brain has about @xmath137 synapses ) and plasticity .",
    "after the first experimental realization of memristor @xcite , it became widely accepted that memristor is a good candidate to emulate synapse .",
    "this is because of the fact that memristors can be fabricated in high density through the crossbar technology .",
    "in addition , similar to biological synapse , the conductance of the memristor can be changed by passing current from it or applying voltage to it @xcite .",
    "based of these evidences , several authors have tried to use memristor as a synapse and showed that this passive element can facilitate hardware implementation of artificial neural networks and their corresponding learning rules such as spike time dependent plasticity ( stdp ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ figconvneur : a ] shows the memristor crossbar - based structure that has been proposed in almost all of these works . in this figure , each fabricated memristor at each crosspoint represents one synapse which connects one presynaptic to one postsynaptic neuron . in this case , every neuron ( shown by a triangle ) in the input layer is directly connected to every neuron in output layer with unique synaptic weights . if in fig .",

    "this means that when one input and one output neuron fire simultaneously , the weight of that synapse which is connecting these neurons should be increased ( strengthened ) . for this purpose , in fig .",
    "[ figconvneur : a ] memristance of the memristor connecting these neurons should be modified ( actually it should be decreased ) . however , unfortunately it is well known that hebbian learning rule ( although is very simple ) is not enough to train neural networks and other complex methods like backpropagation learning algorithm are needed @xcite .",
    "moreover , hardware implementation of currently in use learning methods like stdp on this structure is difficult and needs some auxiliary circuits @xcite . in addition , in these kinds of learning rules synaptic weights may be either increased or decreased .",
    "these mentioned drawbacks have caused the efficient hardware implementation of neural networks very difficult .",

    "however , in learning phase , we can see some differences . in the structure representing hardware implementation of artificial neural networks such as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ figconvneur : a ] , learning is usually carried out based on methods like back propagation or stdp . on the other hand ,",
    "learning in our proposed method is based on the creation of fuzzy relation between input and output variables or concepts .",

    "[ figa ] based on available fuzzy training data described in section [ fuzreltrdat ] . in this process ,",
    "simultaneous application of input and output fuzzy numbers to inputs and outputs of the structure is equivalent with the simultaneous firing of input and output neurons and the value of applied membership grades to each of input or output terminals actually determines the firing strength of each neuron . by this statement",
    "we mean that each simultaneous firing of input and output neurons generates one fuzzy input - output training data .",
    "therefore , in our belief , all of neurons are active at the same time during learning phase but with different confidence degrees where output of each neuron determines the confidence degree of its activation .",
    "in fact , when we connect @xmath54 to the column of the crossbar representing concept @xmath0 it means that the neuron in input layer which represents concept @xmath0 is firing with the confidence degree of @xmath54 . by interpreting applied membership grades as a firing strength of neurons , the concept of ink drop spread introduced in section [ inkdrop ] to create fuzzy relation on the crossbar ( see fig .",
    "[ figfuzrelcreation ] ) becomes equal to primary hebbian learning rule in neural networks .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ figfuzrelcreation ] from another point of view says that weights of those connections which are connecting simultaneously firing input and output neurons should be strengthened .",
    "however , the amount of increase of the weight of each connection should be proportional to the firing strength of those input and output neurons .",
    "when confidence degrees of firing of both input and output neurons are high , the weight of the connection connecting these input and output neurons should be increased more ( see eq .",
    "[ eqfr ] or eq .",
    "[ updateink ] ) .",
    "note that if we have crisp input - output training data instead of fuzzy one , ink drop spread method in fig .",
    "[ figfuzrelcreation ] will become completely the same as hebbian learning rule in conventional neural networks .",
    "therefore , it seems that our proposed fuzzy inference system implements the same function as neural networks and also learns in a similar way . in this case",
    ", a simple question may arise : _",
    "what is the benefit of our proposed structure and inference method compared to conventional neural networks?_. to answer this question , the reader should note that in reality , by these explanations we tried to show that neural networks and fuzzy are not two disjoint fields .",
    "in fact , we strongly believe that the reason which causes hebbian learning not to be able to learn neural networks properly is the misinterpretation of the nature of input and output signals in neural networks .",
    "let s look at neural networks from another point of view for a short time .",
    "suppose that each neuron represents one and only one concept like @xmath0 where @xmath34 can be a numerical or linguistic variable .",
    "note that in this situation , spatial location of each neuron in the entire system determines its corresponding concept .",
    "in addition , assume that output ( firing strength ) of each neuron in the network specifies the confidence degree of the activation of that neuron or its corresponding concept .",
    "in this case , combination of those neurons ( or concepts ) lied in one layer and their corresponding confidence degrees ( outputs ) simply creates a fuzzy number .",
    "now , application of primary hebbian learning method to this described neural network with this kind of input and output signals will result in a creation of fuzzy relation on the matrix representing connection weights .",
    "note that changing the functionality of neural networks to work with confidence or membership degrees is not in contrast with biological findings but in return it offers some interesting properties .",
    "first of all , as we will illustrate in the section of simulation result , in spite of conventional neural networks a simple primary hebbian learning method ( or equivalently creating fuzzy relation ) is completely enough to learn these kinds of networks .",
    "consequently , as we showed in this paper their hardware implementation becomes more simple than other learning methods in artificial neural networks such as stdp or backpropagation .",
    "second , since in hebbian learning the connection weights are only strengthened , they will always be non - negative .",
    "note that we have the same case in our proposed fuzzy inference system since the created fuzzy relation on the crossbar is always non - negative .",
    "it is clear that working with non - negative weights is much simpler than working with weights which can have both positive and negative values .",
    "third , if after the training of the conventional neural networks , we plot the matrix which is holding connection weights as a surface it will have no meaningful shape and no information can be obtained from it .",
    "however , corresponding surface in a neural network which works with confidence or membership degrees is a fuzzy relation where its shape describes the overall behavior of input and output variables versus each other .",
    "remember that human brain remembers most concepts and relations through the images ( surfaces ) .",
    "fourth , in the field of artificial neural networks and based on biological findings , it is common to put a threshold on the outputs of neurons .",
    "however , putting threshold on confidence or membership degrees ( output of our proposed structure ) seems to be more logical than putting threshold on meaningless output values in conventional neural networks .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that that in sec .",
    "[ fuzreltrdat ] we told that by increasing the number of training data , @xmath108 should approach zero .",
    "in this case , signals that propagate in the network will become similar to spike and therefore we would have spiking neural networks .    to summarize , in this section we tried to show that it is possible to look at the working procedure of neural networks from another aspect .",
    "if we accept that biological neurons transmit information in the form of confidence degrees , then the computational task which is done in conventional neural network will become equal to our proposed fuzzy inference method with extra advantages .",
    "in this section , we want to verify the efficiency of our proposed hardware and fuzzy inference method by conducting several simulations . in the first simulation ,",
    "we show how mathematical functions can be constructed in an unprecise manner and how function composition can be done in our proposed structure . for this purpose , consider the creation of two fuzzy relations representing two different functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 on two distinct samples of the circuit shown in fig .",

    "it is worth to mention that since in combinational circuits like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ figcomb : a ] output of one circuit directly connects to inputs of other circuit , input signals of one circuit will come from previous circuits .",

    "[ figmultinpfun ] will cause fuzzy relations to be created on the crossbar .",
    "figures [ fuzxyzrel : a ] and [ fuzxyzrel : b ] show these formed fuzzy relations on the crossbar separately after this training process .",
    "now , similar to what is done in previous simulation , _",
    "i.e. _ by application of randomly generated crisp data and defuzzification of produced output fuzzy number , the model of function defined in eq .",
    "[ eq161 ] can be reconstructed .",
    "the result of this modeling test is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig161:b ] .",
    "the mean square error ( mse ) between the target function and constructed model is 0.021 .",
    "this simulation clearly demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed inference method in modeling multi - input functions .    nowadays , nano - scale devices and molecular electronics promise to overcome the fundamental physical limitation of lithography - based silicon vlsi technology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been demonstrated that nano devices such as nanoscale crossbars can be fabricated efficiently by using bottom - up self - assembly techniques without relying on lithography to define the smallest feature size @xcite . however , non - determinism in bottom - up self - assembly chemical processes at molecular scale results in more defects compared to highly controlled lithography - based manufacturing processes currently used in cmos technologies @xcite .",
    "therefore , defect tolerance is necessary for circuits which are realized through the usage of nano - scale devices @xcite . in the next simulation",
    ", we will illustrate the excellent fault tolerance capability of our proposed hardware .",
    "figure [ fig161:c ] shows the result of modeling test obtained by repeating the above simulation but this time with the hardware which has some defects . in this test",
    ", we have assumed that approximately half of the memristors in the memristor crossbar of the circuit of fig .",
    "[ figmultinpfun ] is not working .",
    "this means that these randomly chosen memristors have the memristance @xmath69 and their memristance can not be changed during the training process . in other words , we have assumed that these faulty memristors behave completely the same as a simple resistor with the resistance of @xmath69 and nothing can be stored at these points .",
    "the training set and the value of other parameters in this simulation are the same as the previous test .",
    "the mean square error ( mse ) between the target function and constructed model is 0.0281 .",
    "figure [ fig161:c ] indicates that although 50 percent of all of the memristors in the crossbar are working incorrectly , our proposed hardware still can model functions with acceptable accuracy .",
    "in this paper we proposed a new fuzzy inference system and a simple method to create fuzzy relation based on input and output fuzzy sets .",
    "in addition our proposed scheme has this benefit that fuzzy relation can be formed in it based on fuzzy training data and therefore offering learning capability . since one of the main problems of fuzzy systems relates to their efficient hardware implementation , we have also designed simple memristor crossbar - based circuit as a hardware implementation of our proposed inference method .",
    "simulation results show that this structure can effectively be used to construct multi - input functions .",
    "moreover , we illustrated that samples of this memristor crossbar - based analog circuit can be sequentially connected to each other to create a cellular structure on which complex functions can be constructed .",
    "finally , according to the similarities between our proposed fuzzy inference method and recently suggested memristor crossbar - based circuits for constructing artificial neural networks , we showed that if input and output signals of neural networks be of a kind of confidence degree , then the computational task which is done in conventional neural network will become equal to our proposed fuzzy inference method with extra advantages .",
