    "collisions of deformed nuclei , such as @xmath1u , are an interesting alternative to those of more spherical @xmath2au nuclei at rhic because changes in the nuclear orientation allow wider variations in energy density within the same system @xcite .",
    "previously , studies of u+u collisions were discussed in the context of elliptic flow . the quantity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the elliptic flow parameter and @xmath5 is the initial spatial eccentricity , provides valuable information about the matter created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . in a dilute system , @xmath3 scales like @xmath6 , where @xmath7  is the charged particle density and @xmath8 is the transverse area of the overlap zone . in central au+au collisions at @xmath9 = 200 gev @xmath3 reaches the limit predicted by ideal hydrodynamics for strongly - interacting matter @xcite which can be interpreted as a signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "it was argued that u+u interactions could provide higher densities and a larger spatial eccentricity , testing whether @xmath3 saturates , as predicted by ideal hydrodynamics , or increases further with @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "charmonium production is another key observable for studying the properties of the hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "some time ago @xmath0  suppression was proposed as a signal of qgp formation  @xcite .",
    "the suppression is expected to arise from color screening of the binding potential in a qgp , similar to debye screening in a classical electromagnetic plasma .",
    "the magnitude of the suppression depends on the charmonium binding energy and the energy density of the medium , related to the temperature .",
    "therefore , studies of @xmath0  production , particularly at low transverse momenta , reveal the thermodynamic properties of the medium .",
    "the suppression of @xmath0  production has been studied in detail at the cern sps and at rhic .",
    "the na50 and na60 experiments at the cern sps , @xmath9 = 17.3 gev , observed strong @xmath0  suppression as a function of collision centrality  @xcite .",
    "results from the phenix collaboration at rhic show that the @xmath0  suppression in midrapidity au+au collisions at @xmath9 = 200 gev is similar to that observed at sps energies  @xcite even though the energy densities and temperatures reached at rhic are much higher than those at the sps .",
    "moreover , the forward rapidity @xmath0  suppression at rhic is stronger than at midrapidity .",
    "such a pattern suggests that either additional processes compensate for the effects of color screening or the suppression has different origins at the two energies .",
    "there are several processes which may affect charmonium production in nucleus - nucleus collisions . for comprehensive reviews of different aspects of quarkonium in - medium interactions ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize a few relevant features , some of which we address in more detail later .",
    "suppression by cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects such as parton shadowing and absorption by nuclear matter are very important , although not yet established with satisfactory precision @xcite .",
    "for example , parameterizations of gluon shadowing differ significantly between models @xcite . at rhic energies ,",
    "cnm effects are studied in d+au collisions .",
    "changing the shadowing parametrization can significantly affect the magnitude of the absorption cross section required to match the measured nuclear modification factor @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , feed - down from radiative or hadronic decays account for 40 - 50% of the observed @xmath11 quarkonium states ( @xmath0  and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the higher mass quarkonium states have very different radii and formation times and should thus also have different absorption cross sections . while the experimentally measured @xmath13 absorption cross section is significantly larger than the @xmath0 at fixed - target energies , the difference decreases with increasing @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the energy and @xmath14 dependence of @xmath15 absorption is unknown @xcite .",
    "the importance of absorption for higher bottomonium states is also not known .    if color screening dominates the @xmath0  in - medium interaction , the characteristic pattern of sequential charmonium  melting \" should be observed .",
    "the binding energies of higher mass charmonium states , @xmath13 and @xmath15 , are smaller than the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore these states dissociate at lower energy densities compared to @xmath0  so that , at higher @xmath16 their feed - down would no longer contribute to the measured @xmath0   yield .",
    "the remaining , direct , @xmath0   production would be suppressed at larger energy densities .",
    "this process would result in a step - like dependence of the @xmath0  survival probability as a function of energy density @xcite .",
    "a similar sequential melting would apply to bottomonium .    suppression due to interactions with comoving partonic and hadronic matter has also been postulated .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of comover dissociation is similar to that of nuclear absorption @xcite .",
    "the effects are generally assumed to be small although they strongly depend on the model @xcite .",
    "@xmath0  production may be also enhanced by statistical coalescence in qgp . in this case , the @xmath0  yield , @xmath17 , is proportional to the square of the number of charm quarks in the system , @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 .",
    "the charm yield is expected to be proportional to the number of binary @xmath20 collisions , @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 . the @xmath23 production rate is not expected to be modified in the qgp . if the density of charm quarks is high enough , then secondary @xmath0  production by coalescence of uncorrelated @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks at hadronization can occur @xcite .",
    "combinations of the above effects have previously been used to describe the @xmath0  data . despite different assumptions about the initial state of the system , models including cold matter effects together with different combinations of color screening , comover absorption , and coalescence give quantitatively similar results at rhic @xcite .",
    "it is expected that u+u collisions could provide additional means for distinguishing between these effects .    by selecting particular orientations of u+u collisions ,",
    "different path lengths through nuclear matter , resulting in different effective nuclear absorption cross sections and available energy densities , could be studied .",
    "interactions with the long axes of u nuclei aligned along the beam (  tip+tip \" or ",
    "tt \" configurations ) give the highest energy densities as well as the longest path , @xmath26 , through the matter .",
    "in contrast , @xmath26 is shortest in the configuration where the short axes of the u nuclei are aligned along the beam axis (  side+side \" or ",
    "ss \" configurations ) .",
    "different orientations of u+u interactions could study nuclear absorption with reduced uncertainties due to shadowing , as we will show . in general ,",
    "u+u interactions provide an additional check on models which describe the au+au data because some effects , such as shadowing , should be similar in u+u and au+au interactions .",
    "we investigate the feasibility of complementing au+au collisions with u+u studies of charmonium production and suppression to distinguish between scenarios of @xmath0  in - medium interactions .",
    "we also discuss cnm effects in u+u collisions .",
    "here , we discuss two types of cold nuclear matter effects : nuclear absorption and shadowing .",
    "shadowing , the modification of the parton densities in nuclei relative to free protons , is an initial - state effect .",
    "nuclear absorption , the breakup of the charmonium state as it traverses nuclear matter , is a final - state process .",
    "the two effects are assumed to factorize .",
    "we neglect interactions with hadronic comovers .",
    "we employ the computational framework for studies of cold nuclear matter effects described in ref .",
    "the nuclear parton densities , @xmath27 , where @xmath14 is the atomic mass number , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the transverse and longitudinal location of the parton in position space , @xmath30 is the parton momentum fraction and @xmath31 is the interaction scale , factorize into the nucleon density in the nucleus , @xmath32 , independent of the kinematics ; the nucleon parton density , @xmath33 , independent of @xmath14 ; and a shadowing ratio , @xmath34 that parameterizes the modifications of the nucleon parton densities in the nucleus so that @xmath35 the effect of shadowing is stronger in central collisions , while at asymptotic distances shadowing disappears . averaging over impact parameter , @xmath36 ,",
    "the minimum bias result measured in nuclear deep - inelastic scattering is regained .",
    "we use the eps09 shadowing parametrization @xcite and assume that the impact parameter dependence of shadowing is proportional to the local nuclear density @xcite and exhibits a relatively sharp transition region around @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsi_surv_probab_shadowing ] .",
    "if one assumes instead that the impact parameter dependence is proportional to the path length @xmath26 , @xmath38 exhibits a weaker transition region @xcite .",
    "we discuss the consequences of different assumptions of this @xmath36 dependence in the next section . at rhic energies",
    "quarkonium production is dominated by gluon fusion .",
    "therefore , shadowing generally refers to gluon shadowing in this context .",
    "we employed the woods - saxon density distribution for deformed nuclei @xcite to describe @xmath39 , @xmath40)^{-1 } \\\\",
    "r_c \\equiv r_0(1 + \\beta_2 y_{20 } + \\beta_4 y_{40})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the density at the center of the nucleus , @xmath42 is the total effective radius , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are legendre polynomials , dependent on @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the polar angle , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the deformation parameters are @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51  fm and @xmath52  fm . in the ss orientation , @xmath53 and @xmath54  fm while in the tt orientation , @xmath55 and @xmath56  fm .",
    "to implement nuclear absorption on quarkonium production , the production cross section is weighted by the survival probability , @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the longitudinal production point and @xmath60 is the point at which the state is absorbed .",
    "the nucleon absorption cross section , @xmath61 , typically depends on the spatial location at which the state is produced and how far it travels through the medium .",
    "in this section , we investigate whether it is possible to separate the cnm effects of shadowing and absorption in u+u collisions .",
    "nuclear absorption depends on the nuclear path length @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , it is expected to be considerably different in the tt and ss orientations of u+u collisions . because @xmath26 also depends on the impact parameter , @xmath36",
    ", the effective magnitude of nuclear absorption also changes with @xmath36 .",
    "the dependence of shadowing on the tt and ss orientations is expected be less significant . moreover ,",
    "if the difference between collisions in the tt and ss orientations does not depend ( or depends only weakly ) on the strength of the shadowing , then the ratio of quarkonium production in tt and ss orientations would be effectively independent of the shadowing parametrization .",
    "this would greatly simplify the extraction of absorption effects because the systematic error due to shadowing would be significantly reduced .",
    "we first investigate shadowing and nuclear absorption separately and then discuss the combined intensity of these cnm effects in u+u collisions . in order to estimate the strength of each effect , we compare results in the tt and ss orientations where the difference between the two cases should be most apparent .",
    "we assume that it will be possible to select these configurations with an efficiency appropriate for charmonium studies , as discussed later .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "there are several strategies which can be used to select tt and ss ( or tt- and ss - enriched ) event samples . in general , the number of binary collisions in central and mid - central collisions in tt configurations is higher than in ss configurations at the same @xmath36 , leading to higher multiplicities in tt configurations . therefore tt - enriched head - on ( @xmath62 ) events could be selected by experimental cuts on the measured charged - track multiplicities .",
    "this method could be extended to other centralities .",
    "the centrality class can be established by employing zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) which measure the energy of spectator nucleons traveling in the forward and backward directions .",
    "tt - enriched events would be then selected from the centrality class by a multiplicity cut .",
    "results obtained in monte carlo glauber simulations show that the charged track multiplicity @xmath63 in central tt collisions is @xmath64 higher than central collisions in the ss configuration at @xmath65 .",
    "the difference decreases with @xmath36 although @xmath66 is still 10% higher at @xmath67  fm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the multiplicity difference is suitable for offline event selection .",
    "selection of tip and side orientations in @xmath68u collisions would be probably more challenging because the overall multiplicity will be lower .",
    "however , the number of binary collisions in @xmath69tip interactions should be significantly higher than in @xmath69side collisions .",
    "the relative difference could be large enough for separation to be feasible in those cases .",
    "another approach for selecting collision orientation was proposed in ref .",
    "tt and ss configurations have different elliptical eccentricities and , consequently , different magnitudes of anisotropic flow . the ` reduced flow vector ' was proposed in addition to multiplicity cuts to select ss and tt samples with high purity .    in any case , selecting a particular collision geometry requires detailed modeling and simulations of experimental observables .    note that , for cnm studies , high - purity samples are not required : the min - bias data are dominated by ss configurations . thus tt - enriched samples with sufficiently longer path lengths @xmath26 than min - bias collisions in the same centrality class would be appropriate for studying nuclear absorption .",
    "experimental cuts could thus be adjusted to optimize the balance between the desirable @xmath70 for physics and the efficiency of event selection .",
    "as shown in sec .  [ sec : cnm ] , the strength of gluon shadowing is one of the largest uncertainties in the determination of cold nuclear matter effects on @xmath0  production .",
    "the effects of shadowing are almost identical for au+au and u+u collisions averaged over impact parameter . thus the relative uncertainty can be reduced by studying @xmath0  production in u+u and au+au collisions within the same centrality class . as outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the @xmath0  yield , @xmath17 , produced by statistical recombination is proportional to the number of charm quarks in the system : @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . we define the relative nuclear modification factor @xmath71  as @xmath74 the ratio of @xmath0  yields scaled by the number of binary @xmath20 collisions , @xmath75 , in au+au and u+u collisions respectively . if the @xmath0 s are produced by coalescence and suppression is indepedent of nuclear absorption and energy density , then @xmath76 .",
    "the min bias ratio @xmath71  has an advantage over @xmath77 , the ratio of the @xmath0   yield in more central bins relative to that in the most peripheral bin , because @xmath71   does not depend on shadowing , see figs .",
    "[ fig : jpsi_rdau ] and [ fig : ups_rdau ] .",
    "as we have seen , shadowing can vary significantly between central and peripheral collisions but has a rather weak dependence on impact parameter . indeed ,",
    "if no selection is made on orientation in u+u collisions , the shadowing dependence will cancel in the ratio .    with the large data samples taken by star and phenix in 2009 and 2010 ( and even larger data sets expected for rhic ii )",
    ", the precision of the @xmath0  yields will be driven by systematic rather than statistical uncertainties .",
    "the dominant systematic error ( @xmath78 ) in @xmath79  interactions is the estimate of the integrated luminosity @xcite which does not cancel between d+au and au+au measurements , as seen in ref .",
    "@xcite where the systematic error on @xmath80 is much larger than that on @xmath77 . in the case of @xmath71 ,",
    "systematic uncertainties would mostly cancel when au+au and u+u data are taken by the same detector .",
    "these features of @xmath71  make it useful for testing models of @xmath0  production and in - medium interactions as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "the dependence of nuclear absorption on @xmath36  is rather small , but can be detected if large data sets are collected .",
    "furthermore @xmath71@xmath81 will provide an additional test of models which reproduce @xmath82 .",
    "we have investigated cold nuclear matter effects on charmonium production in u+u collisions .",
    "such collisions provide an interesting opportunity to study @xmath0   in - medium interactions since model - dependent uncertainties can be significantly reduced .",
    "we propose a new observable , @xmath71 , which is free from some of the uncertainties associated with @xmath83 and @xmath77 .",
    "the experimental techniques for quarkonium measurements at rhic are well established ; there are abundant au+au data ; and u+u collisions are planned at rhic in the near future . therefore , our proposed observable @xmath71  represents an additional , important handle on @xmath0  in - medium interactions .",
    "moreover , the energy density achievable in u+u relative to au+au collisions is up to @xmath84 larger , extending the range of energy densities available for testing quarkonium suppression due to color screening .",
    "furthermore , u+u collisions would be also useful for cold nuclear matter studies at lower energies , as part of a rhic beam energy scan program .",
    "nuclear absorption is expected to be larger at lower energies @xcite while there may be antishadowing of the nuclear gluon distribution rather than shadowing .",
    "therefore cold nuclear matter effects could be tested more directly by lower energy u+u collisions .",
