    "pulsar psr b1913 + 16 ( psr j1915 + 1606 ) was the first binary pulsar to be discovered @xcite .",
    "its 7.75-hr binary period and 300 km  s@xmath2 projected orbital velocity suggested that it would exhibit a rich set of potentially measurable relativistic effects , and that has turned out to be the case .",
    "subsequent studies have shown that the pulsar s companion must also be a neutron star . with tidal and rotational stellar distortions eliminated as complicating factors for any dynamical analysis , the system is an essentially clean laboratory for testing relativistic gravity . in this respect ,",
    "the largest remaining complications depend on reference - frame accelerations related to the structure and dynamics of our galaxy .    over the past 35 years , we and our colleagues have timed psr  b1913 + 16 at arecibo observatory with steadily improving equipment and analysis techniques . among the best known results are measurement of the general relativistic advance of periastron at a rate some 35,000 times that of mercury in the solar system @xcite ; the effect of gravitational radiation damping , causing a measurable rate of orbital decay @xcite ; and detection of changes in the pulse shape , resulting from geodetic spin precession @xcite .",
    "our results continue to be fully consistent with general relativity and have placed strong constraints on alternative , previously viable , relativistic theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide our latest analysis of the pulsar and its orbit , based on timing observations from 1974 through 2006 .",
    "our highest quality dataset consists of 7650 five - minute integrations of the pulse profile at wavelengths near 20  cm , each subsequently reduced to a topocentric time - of - arrival ( toa ) measurement at arecibo observatory .",
    "these data span the years 1981 through 2006 ; earlier measurements are consistent with these but ( owing to their much larger uncertainties ) have little effect on the final results . in 2004",
    "we made a special effort to observe regularly throughout the year , so as to improve quality of the astrometric results .",
    "parameters of the observing equipment and associated measurement uncertainties are presented in table [ table : obsys ] .",
    "further details of the princeton mark i observing system are given by @xcite , while the mark ii and iii are described in @xcite .",
    "the latest system , the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) , consists of four spectrometers optimized for pulsar work , each having 512 frequency channels across a 100 mhz bandwidth and synchronously accumulating the pulsar signal into 1024 phase bins across the full pulsar period .",
    "data were analyzed with the program tempo , using the jpl de405 solar system ephemeris and the relativistic timing model of @xcite .",
    "the damour - deruelle approach is particularly desirable because it leaves open the question of the correct relativistic theory of gravity : one solves for phenomenological parameters whose precise relation to a gravitational theory can be investigated later .",
    "further discussion of the damour - deruelle model and its application to binary pulsars in tempo can be found in @xcite .",
    "important quantities determined in this way include those related to the pulsar s celestial position , spin , and orbit .",
    "the first category includes right ascension @xmath7 , declination @xmath8 , proper motions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , epoch @xmath11 , pulse repetition frequency @xmath12 , spindown rate @xmath13 , and a glitch epoch and frequency discontinuity @xmath14 .",
    "fitted orbital parameters include five keplerian quantities : the projected semimajor axis of the pulsar orbit @xmath15 , eccentricity @xmath16 , epoch of periastron passage @xmath17 , period @xmath18 , and longitude of periastron @xmath19 ; and the following relativistic or `` post - keplerian '' parameters : average rate of periastron advance @xmath20 , variations in gravitational redshift and time dilation @xmath21 , and orbital period derivative @xmath22 . as with most other pulsars that have been timed carefully over several decades , a number of `` nuisance parameters '' must also be measured to account for unmodeled long - term timing irregularities .",
    "these extra fitted terms have no clear physical interpretation beyond being somehow related to the poorly understood structure and dynamics of the spinning neutron star .",
    "their mathematical form is somewhat arbitrary ; as described further below , we have experimented with a number of higher - order time derivatives of the pulsar rotation frequency , and one additional frequency discontinuity .",
    "the astrometric and basic spin parameters determined from the full data set are listed in table  [ table : astromfits ] .",
    "a significant result for proper motion has been obtained for the first time .",
    "while the pulsar position is determined from the annual variation of toas as the earth moves about its orbit , proper motion is determined from a secular variation of this annual signal . timing noise or other systematic effects",
    "can contaminate such measurements .",
    "we now believe that the previously reported value of psr b1913 + 16 s proper motion @xcite was biased by timing noise , a problem which was exacerbated by the concentrated but @xmath23biennially spaced observing campaigns frequently employed for this source . to circumvent these problems , we observed psr b1913 + 16 several times over the course of calendar year 2004 to achieve thorough data coverage around the earth s orbit . by merging the 2004 data with observations made in 1985 - 1988 , which also had good coverage throughout those years , we have now obtained a robust measurement of the pulsar s proper motion .",
    "see section [ sec : vel ] for further analyses of the proper motion result .    as in other pulsars , the measured spindown rate @xmath24 is assumed to be the result of an electromagnetic braking torque on the spinning , strongly magnetized neutron star .",
    "its value is deterministic and ( at the level of accuracy quoted in table  2 ) independent of the span of data over which it is fitted .",
    "in addition , the pulsar experienced a well - defined `` classical '' glitch in may 2003 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath25 of the event is smaller than almost all seen in the population of normal ( not recycled ) pulsars , with only some of the glitches in psr b0355 + 54 having a comparably small magnitude @xcite .",
    "ours is only the second glitch to be detected in a recycled pulsar , with the other ( the smallest known among all pulsars ) occurring in the millisecond pulsar psr b1821@xmath2624 in globular cluster m28 @xcite .    the remaining timing parameters  higher - order derivatives @xmath27 , @xmath28 ,  ,  and ( in some fits ) another small frequency discontinuity in mid-1992  were introduced to the timing solution in an _ ad hoc _ manner , in order to `` whiten '' the remaining post - fit residuals .",
    "although we offer no clear or unique physical interpretation for these parameters , their combined effects are almost certainly a consequence of stochastic timing - noise processes in the neutron star interior @xcite . unlike the case of the well - fitted may 2003 glitch , the values of these fitted parameters are not independent of the data span analyzed and can not be expected to extrapolate the timing behavior accurately to future epochs .",
    "identifying the mid-1992 behavior as a discrete event is highly uncertain , in part because of coarse sampling around that time .",
    "our data can be fit almost as well by introducing several additional frequency derivatives instead of a second discrete event .",
    "similar results were obtained by fitting multiple harmonically related sinusoids to the timing noise with the routine `` fitwaves '' @xcite of program tempo2 @xcite , instead of the multiple frequency derivatives described above .",
    "since we are unable to converge on a unique glitch parameter solution for the mid-1992 behavior , we do not include this event in table  [ table : astromfits ] .",
    "fitted orbital parameters for psr b1913 + 16 are listed in table [ table : orbfits ] . as we have emphasized before @xcite",
    ", values for each of the damour - deruelle post - keplerian parameters expected in general relativity can be expressed in terms of the keplerian parameters and the initially unknown masses of the pulsar and its companion , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the appropriate expressions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath31^{2/3 }      { \\rm deg~yr}^{-1 } , \\\\",

    "we have substituted values for @xmath18 and @xmath16 from table [ table : orbfits ] , and used the constants @xmath32  s and 1 julian yr @xmath33  s. the figures in parentheses represent uncertainties in the last quoted digit , determined by propagating the uncertainties listed in table [ table : orbfits ] . in each case , the uncertainties are dominated by the experimental uncertainty in orbital eccentricity , @xmath16 .",
    "( 1 ) may be solved for the total mass of the psr b1913 + 16 system , yielding @xmath34 . the additional constraint privided by eq .",
    "( 2 ) permits a solution for each star s mass individually , @xmath4 and @xmath35 . as far as we know , these are the most accurately determined stellar masses outside the solar system .",
    "it is interesting to note that since the value of newton s constant @xmath36 is known to a fractional accuracy of only @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be expressed more accurately in solar masses than in grams .      according to general relativity",
    "a binary star system should radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves .",
    "peters and matthews ( 1963 ) showed that the resulting rate of change in orbital period should be @xmath39 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting values obtained for @xmath29 and @xmath30 and propagating uncertainties appropriately , we obtain the general relativistic predicted value @xmath40    equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) apply in the orbiting system s reference frame .",
    "relative acceleration of that frame with respect to the solar system barycenter will cause a small additional contribution to the observed @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed discussion of this effect and other possible contributions to @xmath41 .",
    "recent progress in determining the galactic - structure parameters allows us to update the relevant quantities and compute a new value for the kinematic correction to @xmath41 . using @xmath42  kpc for the distance to the galactic center and @xmath43  km  s@xmath2 for the circular velocity of the local standard of rest @xcite , and @xmath44  kpc for the pulsar distance @xcite",
    ", we obtain the kinematic contribution , @xmath45 : @xmath46 thus , we find the ratio of observed to predicted rate of orbital period decay to be @xmath47 agreement between the observed orbital decay and the general relativistic prediction is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : parabola ] , which shows how excess orbital phase ( relative to an unchanging orbit ) has accumulated since the pulsar s discovery in 1974 .",
    "we note that the overall experimental uncertainty embodied in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is now dominated by uncertainties in the galactic parameters and pulsar distance , not the pulsar timing measurements .",
    "even better agreement between observed and expected values of @xmath41 would be obtained if the true value of @xmath48 or @xmath49 were slightly smaller , or @xmath50 slightly larger .",
    "for example , observed and expected values agree if @xmath51 kpc , which is within the @xcite error envelope .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether improved future estimates of these quantities will show one or more of these conditions to be true .",
    "two other relativistic phenomena are potentially measurable in the psr b1913 + 16 system : geodetic precession and gravitational propagation delay .",
    "spin - orbit coupling should cause the pulsar s spin axis to precess @xcite , which should lead to observable pulse shape changes . @xcite",
    "first detected such changes , which were observed and modeled further by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the pulsar beam is elongated in the latitude direction and becomes wider in longitude with increasing distance from the beam axis in latitude .",
    "these models suggest that in the next decade or so , precession may move the beam far enough that the pulsar will become unobservable from earth for some decades , before eventually returning to view .",
    "[ sec : propresults ] the excess propagation delay @xcite caused by passage of pulsar signals through the curved spacetime of the companion is largest at the pulsar s superior conjunction .",
    "the maximum amplitude varies with time because the impact parameter at superior conjunction depends strongly on the current value of @xmath52 . in this respect",
    "the orbital geometry was particularly unfavorable in the mid-1990s ( see damour & taylor 1992 ) , but in coming years the propagation delay should start to become observable . @xcite",
    "characterize the measurable quantities as range @xmath53 and shape @xmath54 , of the shapiro delay , where @xmath55 is the orbital inclination .",
    "as orbital precession carries our line of sight deeper into the companion s gravitational well , future observations should permit the robust measurement of these two parameters , and hence two additional tests of relativistic theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "our pulsar proper motion measurement ( section [ sec : astroresults ] ) , combined with the distance estimate discussed in section [ sec : radresults ] , corresponds to a transverse velocity ( with respect to the solar system barycenter ) of 75  km@xmath56s@xmath2 with a galactic position angle of @xmath57 ; i.e. , directed 36 degrees above the galactic plane .",
    "the @xmath58 distance uncertainty places similar limits on velocity accuracies .",
    "we can now estimate two components of the pulsar systemic velocity in _ its own _ standard of rest by combining the measured pulsar transverse velocity and distance , the solar motion with respect to our local standard of rest @xcite , and galactic quantities @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
    "the third component of motion , which is inaccessible via proper motion measurements , lies close to the direction of galactic rotation at the pulsar s position .",
    "the pulsar s galactic planar and polar velocity components relative to its standard of rest are 247 km / s almost directly away from the galactic center and 51 km / s toward the galactic north pole , respectively .",
    "( this is significantly larger than the measured velocity in the solar system barycenter frame because the pulsar s standard of rest velocity fortuitously cancels much of the pulsar s peculiar velocity with respect to it . )",
    "the systemic velocity of b1913 + 16 is significantly larger than other well - measured double neutron star binary system velocities , including the j0737 - 3037 ( transverse velocity 10 km / s ; stairs et al .",
    "2006 ) , j1518 + 4905 ( transverse velocity 25 km / s ; janssen et al .",
    "2008 ) , and b1534 + 12 ( transverse velocity 122 km / s ; thorsett et al .",
    "2005 ) systems .",
    "we have analyzed the full set of arecibo timing data on pulsar b1913 + 16 to derive the best values of all measurable quantities .",
    "a significant proper motion has finally been determined .",
    "a small glitch was observed in the pulsar s timing behavior , the second known glitch in the population of recycled pulsars",
    ". the measured rate of orbital period decay continues to be almost precisely the value predicted by general relativity , providing conclusive evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation .",
    "uncertainties in galactic accelerations now dominate the error budget in @xmath59 , and are likely to do so until the pulsar distance can be measured more accurately .",
    "we expect that the shapiro gravitational propagation delay will yield additional tests of relativistic gravity within a few more years .",
