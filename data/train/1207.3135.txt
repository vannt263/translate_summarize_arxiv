    "<S> the hybridization , @xmath9 , is energy ( @xmath10 ) dependent and enhanced by the strong scattering potential at the vacancy . @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the coulomb interaction between the two localized levels . </S>",
    "<S> see eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> ]    experimental evidence of magnetic local moments ( mlm ) in irradiated graphene at very low temperatures has been recently reported in  @xcite . in another experiment using irradiated samples  @xcite , the kondo effect with surprisingly high kondo temperatures ( @xmath13-@xmath14 k , obtained by fitting resistivity data to conventional spin-@xmath15 kondo laws  @xcite ) was observed . </S>",
    "<S> _ a priori _ , the latter observation appears to be at odds with the observations of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at the temperatures of the manchester group experiment ( @xmath16k )  @xcite , the measured spin-@xmath15 mlm of the vacancies created by irradiation should be quenched by the kondo effect observed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the authors of  @xcite reported a @xmath17 with a rather weak dependence on gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> however , theories of the kondo effect in graphene  @xcite predict a critical coupling below which mlm are stable at the dirac point ( dp ) whilst @xmath17 remains small around the dp  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the puzzle described above calls for re - visiting the magnetic properties of isolated single atom vacancies in graphene . here we show that earlier theories  @xcite must be modified to account for the strong scattering potential of the vacancy . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> the later is responsible for a dramatic change of the energy dependence of the hybridization with the @xmath1 band of a level localized at a reconstructed vacancy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the energy @xmath10 dependence of the hybridization is changed to @xmath18^{-1}$ ] near the dp ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) , which is different from the pseudogap behavior @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) considered earlier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it becomes possible for vacancy mlm to be quenched at @xmath21 k ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of defect - induced magnetism in graphene has been widely discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) , mainly using various types of static mean - field theories . however , a recent study  @xcite using dynamical mean - field theory concluded that vacancies should allow for the formation of mlm that are _ ferromagnetically _ coupled to the conduction band of graphene . within hartree - fock , this happens because of the strong local correlations  @xcite and the large enhancement of the local density of states in the neighborhood of the vacancy  @xcite . however , the analysis of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite focuses only on the contribution to the vacancy magnetic moment from @xmath1-band electrons . _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ calculations using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , can account for the contribution of the dangling @xmath0 orbitals and are also able to describe the possible reconstructions of the vacancy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such studies predict different values for the vacancy mlm  @xcite .    indeed , provided the dangling @xmath0 orbitals </S>",
    "<S> are not passivated , the vacancy reconstructs  @xcite following a jahn - teller distortion . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a carbon pentagon with a strong bond resulting from two of the dangling @xmath0 orbitals ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) is formed . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining dangling @xmath0 orbital is mainly localized at the apical atom ( opposite to the reconstructed bond ) , and appears as a level at @xmath22 ev  @xcite below the dp ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> double occupation of this orbital is strongly suppressed by a rather strong coulomb repulsion @xmath23 ev  @xcite , which leads to the formation of a mlm . however , in flat graphene , symmetry forbids the hybridization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , meaning that the electron in the dangling @xmath0 orbital can not hybridize with @xmath1 band and thus exchange with conduction electrons . in absence of other contributions to the mlm  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this fact is hard to reconcile with the observed vacancy effects on charge  @xcite and spin transport  @xcite .    the above picture changes if we recall that graphene is a membrane that becomes easily rippled under the effect of strain and temperature  @xcite . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> dft - gga calculations  @xcite indicate that , under rather small ( @xmath24% ) isotropic compression , regions containing reconstructed vacancies do ripple  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rippling is achieved by means of sp@xmath6-sp@xmath7 hybridization of the carbon bonds  @xcite , which admixes the @xmath0 with p@xmath25 orbitals at a given atom , resulting in new @xmath0 orbitals pointing along directions that are no longer perpendicular to the @xmath26 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in a typical sp@xmath6-sp@xmath7 hybridized configuration , a carbon atom can stick out of the graphene plane . </S>",
    "<S> if the atom contains a dangling @xmath0 orbital , as in the case of the apical atom of a reconstructed vacancy , the @xmath0 orbital will be able hybridize with the @xmath1 band . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the hybridization energy , @xmath27 , can be substantial already for small deviations from planarity  @xcite : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the angle subtended by the dangling @xmath0 orbital atom and the graphene plane , and @xmath31 is the atomic s - p splitting . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in rippled graphene @xmath1 electrons are allowed to hop on and off the dangling @xmath0 orbital , thus leading to an effective ( anti - ferromagnetic , af ) exchange with the conduction band . however </S>",
    "<S> , this also means that the mlm of the dangling @xmath0 orbital may be quenched by the kondo effect . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this possibility is not negligible , since the strong scattering potential of the nearby vacancy substantially modifies the local density of states  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath39 is the hybridization with the @xmath1-band , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41  @xcite ) . in the last term , the limit @xmath42 must be taken in order to describe a single - atom vacancy on the a sublattice at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the apical atom corresponds to the b sublattice atom within the same lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion operators @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) destroy ( create ) @xmath1-band electrons of spin @xmath46 on sites belonging to a and b sublattices .    to begin with , we retain only the nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath47 ev  @xcite ) and consider the chemical potential to be at the dp ( i.e. @xmath48 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a nonzero @xmath49 and the next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath50 $ ] will be discussed at the end . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spectrum of @xmath51 contains a localized level ( a zero - mode , zm ) pinned at the dp , which is orthogonal to a continuum of waves scattering off the vacancy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the zm wavefunction is not square normalizable since @xmath52 , but its overlap with the @xmath5-orbital is the largest , which means that the dominant contribution to @xmath38 is from the coulomb interaction between the electrons in the zm and the @xmath5-orbital  @xcite , i.e. @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) destroys ( creates ) electrons in the zm , and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is the hund s coupling and @xmath62 is the coulomb repulsion between electrons in the zm and the @xmath5 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the relative value of these parameters determines whether the vacancy spin is a doublet or a triplet . </S>",
    "<S> however , the extended nature of the zm makes it difficult to obtain accurate estimates for @xmath12 and @xmath11 ( some estimates , obtained on dimensional grounds , are provided in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in absence of accurate input , below we explore the possible magnetic phases for both the doublet and the triplet .    treating electrons in scattering states as non - interacting , </S>",
    "<S> allows us to integrate them out exactly . </S>",
    "<S> their influence on the @xmath5-level can be encapsulated in a self - energy function  @xcite , whose imaginary part is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , being @xmath65 the local density of states at the apical atom  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter exhibits a singular behavior @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) around the dp  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can mimic the effect of the self - energy by representing the @xmath1 band as a electron reservoir with energy - dependent tunneling into the @xmath5-level  @xcite , leading to @xmath68 , \\label{eq : am } \\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a high - energy cut - off of order of the width of the @xmath1 band . since ( for small angle @xmath30 ) @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> charge fluctuations in the dangling @xmath0 orbital are small at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> however , the charge state of the zm is determined by the magnitude of the parameter @xmath73 : @xmath74 ( doublet ) for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ( triplet ) for @xmath77 . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the charge fluctuations can be integrated out using a schrieffer - wolff transformation , which leads to a kondo model : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the _ total _ spin operator of the vacancy : @xmath82 , for the doublet ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 , for the triplet ( @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for @xmath86 and the potential @xmath87 depend on the total spin of the vacancy  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    however , for @xmath88 , the charge fluctuations in the zm level are not negligible and the description in terms of eq </S>",
    "<S> .   breaks down . in such a case , we must deal with the full anderson model , eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> having @xmath88 requires fine tuning as it corresponds to a quantum phase transition between the doublet and the triplet , which will be analyzed elsewhere  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that @xmath89 is large enough so that using eq .   with a cut - off @xmath90 is sufficient .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we carry out a scaling analysis of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative scaling equations for @xmath91 and @xmath92 read : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is assumed to be a slowly varying function of @xmath95 , which is the case since near the dp @xmath96^{-1}$ ] and @xmath97 with logarithmic accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as @xmath95 is reduced , @xmath98 and @xmath99 grow and the vacancy enters the strong coupling regime . for @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion was reached in  @xcite based on an analysis of the orthogonality catastrophe in defective graphene . in the strong coupling regimem where @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) , ( [ eq : rg ] ) break down . </S>",
    "<S> however , the kondo temperature can be related to the crossover scale @xmath102 where @xmath100 ( provided @xmath103 before @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of   yields @xmath105 for @xmath106  @xcite . note that , this means a dramatic enhancement of @xmath17 compared to the vanishing ( exponentially small ) @xmath17 of the pseudo - gap  @xcite ( flat - band  @xcite ) kondo models .    </S>",
    "<S> in the strong coupling regime , we have to rely on other methods different from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rg ] ) . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , there are remarkablesimilarities of the present kondo model with one studied by bulla and vojta  @xcite using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) . </S>",
    "<S> these authors considered a spin-@xmath15 kondo model where @xmath107 , with @xmath108 . with logarithmic accuracy </S>",
    "<S> , we can borrow their results for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , two stable strong coupling fixed - points ( fps ) are known to exist : a particle - hole asymmetric local moment ( alm ) fp , at which the vacancy magnetic moment is decouples from the band , and a singlet strong - coupling fixed point ( ssc ) fp , at which the single electron in dangling @xmath0 orbital forms a singlet with the conduction band electrons , and vacancy magnetic moment is thus quenched . </S>",
    "<S> the flow between alm and ssc fps is controlled by a critical point  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .stable phases for the kondo model of eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> ssc stands for singlet strong coupling , alm for asymmetric local moment , and ussc for underscreened strong coupling ; @xmath103 and @xmath111 indicate which coupling ( either @xmath112 or @xmath113 ) in eq . becomes relevant first . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the triplet case ( @xmath85 ) , to the best of our knowledge , there are no nrg results available . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case we can tentatively assume that , as @xmath114 flows to strong coupling , half of the vacancy spin-@xmath115 will be quenched . </S>",
    "<S> applying an argument due to nozires and blandin  @xcite , the residual spin-@xmath15 couples ferromagnetically ( fm ) to the conduction band , that is , for @xmath116 , it is described by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the residual vacancy spin , and @xmath119 . in this strong - coupling coupling picture , </S>",
    "<S> one electron is captured at the first site ( site @xmath120 in our notation above ) of the wilson chain  @xcite representation of @xmath121 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : am ] ) , thus projecting out this site . </S>",
    "<S> the residual spin-@xmath15 couples to the next site of the wilson chain , whose spin is described by the operator @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization function for this site can be obtained by tridiagonalization , which allows to relate the local green s functions at sites @xmath120 and @xmath115 with @xmath120 site projected out ( see  @xcite , chap . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) : @xmath123 , with @xmath124 . hence @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , with logarithmic accuracy , @xmath126 in eq .  , which , together with @xmath127 , implies that @xmath128 renormalizes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath129 describes a stable _ underscreened kondo _ fp . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as in the double case , for large particle - hole asymmetry , @xmath87 , it is also reasonable to expect the existence of a strong - coupling fixed similar to the alm fp , and a critical point in the @xmath8-@xmath86 plane that controls the flow between the two fps . </S>",
    "<S> the possible phases of are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us consider the effect and the next neighbor hopping , @xmath130 , and a small doping @xmath131 . at first sight , </S>",
    "<S> both perturbations introduce particle - hole asymmetry  @xcite , which , for @xmath132 , can be regarded as additional contributions to the bare value of @xmath87 in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the initial conditions for the scaling equations   are modified from their schrieffer - wolff values  @xcite , which favors the flow towards the alm fp . for @xmath131 , </S>",
    "<S> the flow towards the alm fp can be seen as the first stage of a two - stage flow  @xcite , whose final stage occurs at much lower temperatures and may be a crossover from the alm to a more conventional kondo - singlet fp ( see below ) . the rg flow for the triplet case will be analyzed elsewhere  @xcite .    , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , @xmath17 is determined from the equation : @xmath149 where @xmath150 , @xmath135 is the kondo coupling for @xmath151  @xcite , and @xmath152 is the local green s function at the apical atom . the results of a numerical solution of this equation are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) , it can be seen that turning on a finite @xmath49 or @xmath130 strongly suppresses @xmath17 . for finite @xmath130 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath17 appears to vanish at small @xmath153 , which we interpret as the alm fp being favored over the ssc fp . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of @xmath131 seems to be slightly different because the curve for @xmath17 changes its concavity , suggesting a finite but small @xmath17 at small @xmath86 ( finite - size effects prevent us from obtaining accurate results for @xmath17 below @xmath22 k ) . </S>",
