    "the fractional laplacian , understood as a positive power of the classical laplacian , has been present for long time in several areas of mathematics , like fractional calculus and functional analysis .",
    "however , although this operator was used for some differential equations in physics , it was not until the first part of the last decade when it became a very popular object in the field of partial differential equations .",
    "indeed , equations involving fractional laplacians have been one of the most studied research topics in the present century .",
    "nowadays hundreds of papers can be found in the literature with the phrase `` fractional laplacian '' in their titles .",
    "we recall that the fractional laplacian on @xmath8 can be defined for @xmath2 and good enough functions @xmath9 as , see  @xcite , @xmath10 the trigger that produced the outbreak in the field was the paper by l. caffarelli and l.  silvestre @xcite .",
    "the essence of that work is to immerse the fractional laplacian ( a nonlocal operator ) on @xmath8 into a ( local ) partial differential equation problem in @xmath11 , where the known methods of pdes can be applied .",
    "since the appearance of that paper there has been a substantial revision of a big amount of problems in differential equations where the laplacian is replaced by the fractional laplacian .",
    "of course in this trend the numerical analysis should have to be present .",
    "several recent works can be found in this direction , see @xcite .",
    "one of the main troubles to overcome in the numerical approach is the nonlocality of the operator .    on the other hand , in the past few years",
    "the language of semigroups has been used as a versatile tool in the study of different aspects and scenarios for the fractional laplacian with a great success . see @xcite . in particular , in @xcite it was possible to define the fractional discrete laplacian applying this approach . therefore the semigroup language gives us the chance to define and study the fractional discrete laplacian .",
    "an obvious question arises immediately : can this language be used to develop some kind of numerical analysis for the fractional laplacian ?",
    "this is exactly our aim here , to present a discretization method to approximate the fractional laplacian .",
