    "since the first detection of a cosmic ray ( cr ) particle with energy in excess of @xmath0ev by j. linsley at the volcano ranch in 1963  @xcite , the origin of these particles , the most energetic produced in nature , is an enduring problem in astroparticle physics .",
    "these uhecrs that come to earth have sizeable hadronic cross section : their first interaction in the atmosphere occurs roughly at the column depth of @xmath1  g  @xmath2 .",
    "given that the proton column density in the galaxy for most of the uhecr arrival directions is of order @xmath3  g  @xmath2 , and for the universe as a whole even smaller  of order @xmath4  g  @xmath2 per gpc , the particles arriving at earth had no prior interactions with protons except perhaps in the source or its vicinity . adding the requirement of stability and limiting ourselves to known particles , it follows then that primary particles propagating over cosmological distances should be photons , neutrinos , protons or nuclei .",
    "uhecrs are detected at ground level through the extensive air showers they induce in the atmosphere .",
    "measurements of the height of the shower maximum exclude to a large extent the presence of photons or neutrinos so that the bulk of uhecrs detected on earth are protons and/or nuclei ranging from hydrogen to iron elements .",
    "current experimental progress on the determination of the abundance of each element goes beyond the scope of this review , so that the chemical composition is considered here as possibly ranging from protons to iron nuclei .",
    "there is now evidence , mainly from the stringent upper limits on the uhe photon and neutrino fluxes  @xcite , that uhecrs are accelerated by electromagnetic processes and are not the products of the decay of supermassive particles as suggested in the top - down scenarios .",
    "while the energy spectrum and the chemical composition measurements provide constraints helping in inferring properties of the acceleration processes , the identification of the sources can only be achieved by capturing in the arrival directions a pattern suggestive in an evident way of a class of astrophysical objects .",
    "this remains however a difficult task , mostly because of the very small value of the uhecr intensity ( flux per steradian ) at earth  of order @xmath5km@xmath6  sr@xmath7  yr@xmath7 above @xmath8eev ( 1  eev=@xmath9ev )  together with the fact that they experience magnetic deflections during propagation . to collect an increased influx of events , a jump in cumulated exposure as well as improved instrumentation",
    "have been achieved in the past decade .",
    "the pierre auger observatory , located in the province of mendoza ( argentina ) and covering 3000 km@xmath10 , has been allowing since 2004 a scrutiny of the uhecr sky  except in the northernmost quarter  with a total exposure of @xmath11km@xmath10  sr  yr  @xcite .",
    "another scrutiny , mainly of the northern sky , has been provided by the telescope array , located in utah ( usa ) and covering 700 km@xmath10 , operating since 2008 with a total exposure of @xmath12km@xmath10  sr  yr  @xcite .",
    "these latest - generation experiments have allowed an unprecedented sensitivity in searching for anisotropies .",
    "the object of this paper is to review the different searches performed in the last decade in the quest to find uhecr sources by making use of the data collected at these observatories .",
    "the general paradigm motivating the search for anisotropies at ultra - high energies is presented in detail in section  [ sec : uhecr - propagation ] .",
    "the intervening magnetic fields in the extragalactic space and in the galaxy are responsible for making this task difficult by generically isotropizing the arrival directions .",
    "worse , there are large uncertainties in the estimates of the strength for these fields .",
    "the larger deflections are expected to be due to the galactic magnetic field , whose strength is estimated to be of order several microgauss in the disk of the galaxy as inferred from optical and synchrotron polarization measurements and faraday rotation measures of pulsars and extragalactic sources .",
    "cr particles with energies in excess of @xmath13eev have then a larmor radius exceeding the dimensions of the galaxy .",
    "roughly , deflections are expected to behave as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the charge of the crs .",
    "the highest energy particles are thus expected to have sufficient magnetic rigidity to approximately maintain their initial arrival directions provided that the electric charge is not too large . moreover , the horizon of the highest energy particles ( @xmath16eev ) is limited as compared to that of particles of lower energies , because the thresholds of interactions with background radiations filling the universe and leading to large energy losses are then reached . in this way , only the foreground sources are expected to populate the observed sky maps at these energies .",
    "the erasure of the contribution of remote sources provides a natural mechanism to suppress the unresolved isotropic `` background '' , so that uhecrs should originate from the nearby universe , with source distances not exceeding 100  mpc or so . with strong nearby sources present , clusters of events",
    "could stand out from the isotropic background .",
    "searches for excess of close pairs of events could reveal the clusters of events on the sky thus indicating the presence of such sources .",
    "studies of the arrival directions that would be suggestive of such discrete sources without recourse to catalogs of astrophysical objects are summarized in section  [ sec : small - angle - anis ] .",
    "on the other hand , and even without compelling indications for discrete sources , a correlation between uhecr arrival directions and the positions of a class of astrophysical objects could reveal an anisotropy that would trace the sources .",
    "such a correlation would validate the prospects to study individual sources with sufficient exposure .",
    "searches for these cross - correlations with different astrophysical objects and , more generally , with the matter distribution in the nearby universe are presented in section  [ sec : large - angle - anis ] .    besides the cross - correlation approach , the non - uniform distribution of sources and the corresponding anisotropic distribution of arrival directions of uhecrs may be revealed by studying the decomposition of the observed flux in spherical harmonics . for a sufficient exposure , a dipole moment in the angular distribution",
    "could thus be captured , which is due to the density gradient of crs embedded in the galaxy .",
    "a quadrupole pattern could arise as well if nearby sources are distributed along a plane of matter such as the supergalactic plane .",
    "studying the large - scale patterns contained in the arrival direction distribution as a function of energy is thus another important piece of information to decipher .",
    "such studies are reviewed in section  [ sec : multipole - expansion ] .",
    "that no prominent source has been detected so far calls into question the understanding of uhecrs prior to the construction of the latest - generation experiments .",
    "magnetic deflections blur the picture to a larger extent than anticipated .",
    "this does not preclude that sources may be identified on a collective basis rather than on an individual one in the future , but another jump in statistics appears necessary .",
    "prospects for such charged - particle astronomy are discussed in the conclusion of this review .",
    "both protons or nuclei of ultra - high energies attenuate when propagating in the intergalactic space due to interactions with the background radiation : cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , radio and infrared backgrounds .",
    "these interactions occur at the center - of - mass energies accessible to accelerators , so the cross sections are known , or  in the case of nuclear photodisintegration  can be estimated .    depending on the energy of the primary particle and its nature , different processes dominate the attenuation . for protons , there are two dominant processes : @xmath17 pair production on the cmb , which is important at energies @xmath18  eev  @xcite , and pion photoproduction on the cmb at energies of around @xmath19  eev . at energies around and above @xmath20  eev ,",
    "with which we are mostly concerned in this paper , it is thus the second process which is important , causing the so - called greizen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite .",
    "the gzk effect leads to a cutoff in the spectrum at energies higher than @xmath21  eev ; at higher energies it limits the propagation distance for protons to several tens of mpc .    in the case of nuclei , the dominant energy loss results from nuclear photodisintegration .",
    "the nucleon binding energies are of order of a few mev with relatively small variation .",
    "the photodisintegration process becomes thus efficient when the energy of a background photon boosted in the nucleus rest frame is of the order of several mev , the energy necessary to split off an individual nucleon , which is the most frequent outcome of the reaction .",
    "the relevant parameter governing the reaction is thus the @xmath22 relativistic factor of nuclei .    for light nuclei ,",
    "the @xmath22 factor is high enough at the energies of interest to induce photodisintegrations on the cmb background , so that the attenuation of light nuclei is much faster than that of protons , qualitatively , the faster the lighter nucleus . for heavy nuclei like iron",
    ", the @xmath22 factor remains below @xmath23 even at energies as high as @xmath1  eev .",
    "the photodissociation occurs then on infrared background photons with energies about an order of magnitude higher than the typical cmb photon energy .",
    "since these photons are less abundant than the cmb photons , the attenuation of heavy nuclei is relatively slow and is comparable to that of protons . in any case , for both light and heavy nuclei , the result of a photodissociation is most often a nucleon and a lighter nucleus with the same @xmath22 factor , which in turn is subject to further photodisintegration .",
    "the resulting uhecr spectrum and composition have been studied in detail both for protons  @xcite as well as for heavier nuclei  @xcite , and specific benchmark scenarios can be obtained by numerical simulations with any of several existing propagation public codes  @xcite .    ,",
    "obtained using the interaction rate tables from  @xcite and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) model from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=278 ] , obtained using the interaction rate tables from  @xcite and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) model from  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=278 ]    the resulting energy loss lengths strongly depend on the energy of the particles .",
    "examples for protons and iron nuclei are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_loss_length ] , where contributions from the extragalactic background light and the cmb are separated .",
    "the cross sections for pair production can be analytically computed via the bethe - heitler formula , while those for pion photoproduction have been precisely measured in accelerator - based experiments and can be accurately modeled  @xcite . in contrast , the cross sections for photo - disintegration of nuclei , especially for exclusive channels in which charged fragments are ejected , have only been measured in a few cases so that phenomenological models have to be used to estimate them .",
    "a comprehensive estimation of the systematic uncertainties affecting the uhecr propagation , mainly due to the photodisintegration cross sections and to the lack of knowledge of the energy spectrum and redshift evolution of the ebl can be found in  @xcite .",
    "overall , the attenuation of uhecrs eliminates the contribution of distant sources to the observed intensity on earth . due to this mechanism",
    ", all the observed uhecrs should be coming from nearby sources , the higher the energy , the smaller the size of the collection region .",
    "trajectories of charged particles are bent by the intervening magnetic fields , so that the flux from a discrete source is spread over a region of the sky , the size of which depends on the rigidity of the particles .",
    "the absolute magnitude of deflections is such that a particle of unit charge and energy @xmath24eev is deflected by @xmath25 over a distance of 1  kpc in a regular field of magnitude @xmath26 g , and by @xmath27 over a distance of 50  mpc in a random field of magnitude @xmath28  ng and correlation length of @xmath28  mpc .",
    "the extragalactic magnetic fields are assumed to be random and are known quite poorly . from recent measurements of the faraday rotations of extragalactic sources ,",
    "the strength of these fields is constrained from above by @xmath29  ng for coherence lengths larger than @xmath28  mpc @xcite .",
    "some simulations indicate that the fields in voids are even smaller .",
    "for instance , according to @xcite , for protons of @xmath30eev propagating over distances of the order of 500  mpc , the angular deflections should be of the order of @xmath31 except in directions of galaxy clusters and filaments where the encountered magnetic fields are more intense and deflections are thus larger .",
    "hence , given the reduced horizon of particles at the highest energies , the angular deflections in extragalactic space should remain within a few degrees for the majority of nuclei , except for iron having both a larger electric charge and a deeper horizon .",
    "on the other hand , coherent fields with strength up to @xmath32 g are known to exist in the galaxy within a disk of @xmath33pc thickness , roughly described by a structure with arms with reversing field direction between the arms and displaying variations of strength within them  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , there are uncertainties in the way the field falls off along the direction perpendicular to the disk and in the galactic halo .",
    "the main features are a northerly directed poloidal component falling off slowly with the distance from the disk , and oppositely directed toroidal fields in the halo  @xcite . depending on the initial direction outside the galaxy , deflections for protons of @xmath1  eev are of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "additional turbulent fields with significant variations from arm to arm are also present on correlation lengths of @xmath35pc . however , since no systematic change in the propagation direction is expected from multiple small deflections induced by these fields , a net root mean square deflection is a few times smaller than the deflections induced by the regular components  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of cr astronomy is the study of the astrophysical sources producing these particles .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , there is hope for finding discrete sources at the highest energies thanks to the gzk effect , because the isotropic background of cr arrival directions caused by sources distributed throughout the distant universe is suppressed . with dominating foreground sources in our part of the universe",
    ", clusters of events could be detectable .",
    "searches for clusterings at small and intermediate angular scales performed at the pierre auger observatory and the telescope array are presented in this section .      to search for over - densities of events over the exposed sky ,",
    "a simple and popular technique is to build a smoothed sky map by attributing the observed number of events within a circular window with some specific radius to each sampled point on the exposed sky .",
    "the probability of the observed number of events in each sample point is then computed from the binomial distribution by estimating the expected number of events for an isotropic distribution within each circular window .",
    "a significance sky map is then derived .",
    "conventionally , positive ( negative ) significances correspond to over - densities ( under - densities ) .",
    "however , by not specifying _ a priori _ the targeted regions of the sky where the excesses are searched for as well as the angular window radius and the energy threshold , the probability / significance sky map obtained in this way suffers from the numerous performed trials . in a simple situation in which each trial would be independent from every other , obtaining a probability as low as any specified threshold could always be reached by increasing the number of trials .",
    "hence , the number of trials needs to be accounted for in the estimation of the final probability / significance characterizing an excess . in some sense",
    ", this final probability is the original one `` penalized '' for the various scans performed on the parameters intervening in the analysis . in the toy case aforementioned , the penalization factor would just be the number of trials .",
    "in most cases of interest , each trial is however not independent of every other . to calculate the penalized probability of an apparent excess of events , monte - carlo simulations are then the relevant tool allowing for a perfect mimic of the procedure applied to the analyzed data set , reproducing the various correlations between each trial .",
    "mock samples are generated following an isotropic distribution folded into the directional exposure of the considered experiment .",
    "the same number of events as in the actual data is generated , keeping the same energy distribution . on each of these mock samples ,",
    "the set of parameters scanned of the actual data is optimized to capture the most significant excess anywhere on the sampled grid of the exposed sky .",
    "the final probability of the original excess ( and so its associated significance ) is then the number of samples yielding to more significant excess anywhere in the scanned parameter space normalized to the total number of generated samples .",

    "the exposed sky was sampled using circular windows with radii varying from 1@xmath37 up to 30@xmath37 in 1@xmath37 steps , while the energy thresholds were varied from 40  eev up to 80  eev in steps of 1  eev .",

    "other parameters like the energy threshold in the uhecr data set may also be scanned to maximize the excess . in this case , to derive the global significance of the excess , a penalty factor should be applied to account for the effective number of trials , in a way similar to that described in the previous section .",

    ", they populate the structures proportionally to the total amount of matter .",

    "a search for such a correlation is the most straightforward way to check whether objects of a given class are sources of uhecrs or not .",
    "the correlation function between the uhecr events and a given catalog of objects is calculated by counting the number of pairs ( event)-(catalog object ) separated by an angular distance within the range defined by a given angular bin , in a way similar to that described in section  [ sec : small - angle - anis ] for the case of the auto - correlation function .",
    "like in that case , for reasons of small statistics , one usually considers the cumulative number of pairs , that is all pairs with separation smaller than that given .",
    "the @xmath54-value of the excess , if any , is determined either from the monte - carlo simulation in a way similar to that described in section  [ sec : small - angle - anis ] , or semi - analytically by calculating numerically the probability that a single uhecr event falls within a given angular distance from _ any _ of the sources , and then using the binomial distribution .    as in the case of autocorrelations ,",

    "increased statistics is thus necessary to probe the anisotropy contrast levels that may exist in this energy range and contain valuable information about the old - standing question on the way the transition between galactic and extragalactic crs occurs .",
    "also , a current limitation of the measurements is that neither spectra nor anisotropies can yet be studied as a function of the mass of the particles with adequate statistical precision , measurements that would allow a distinction between galactic and extragalactic angular distributions .      above @xmath8eev",
    ", the whole flux of uhecrs is expected to be of extragalactic origin .",
    "although the actual sources of uhecrs are still to be identified , their distribution in the sky is expected to follow , to some extent and as already stressed in previous sections , the large - scale structure of the matter in the universe .",
    "it is thus interesting to highlight again that above 8  eev , the amplitude shown in fig .  [ fig:1stharm ] with a @xmath54-value as low as @xmath181 . assuming that the only significant contribution to the anisotropy is from a dipolar pattern , the amplitude of this signal converts into a @xmath186 dipole amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this hint may constitute in the near future the first detectable signature of extragalactic crs observed on earth .    to characterize further",
    "the angular distribution above 10  eev , the dipole moment on the sphere is of special interest .",
    "an unambiguous measurement of this moment as well as of the full set of spherical harmonic coefficients requires full - sky coverage .",
    "currently , this can be achieved piecemeal by combining data from observatories located in both the northern and southern hemispheres . to this end , a joint analysis using data recorded at the pierre auger observatory and the telescope array above @xmath20  eev has been performed in  @xcite . thanks to the full - sky coverage , the measurement of the dipole moment reported in these studies does not rely on any assumption on the underlying flux of crs .",
    "the main challenge in combining the data sets is to account adequately for the relative exposures of both experiments .",
    "a band of declinations around the equatorial plane is exposed to the fields of view of both experiments , namely for declinations between @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "this overlapping region has been used for designing an empirical procedure to get a relevant estimate of the relative exposures : for an isotropic flux , the integrated energy spectra measured independently by both experiments in the common band would have to be identical .",
    "the commonly covered declination band could thus be used for cross - calibrating empirically the energy spectra of the experiments and for delivering an overall estimate of the relative exposures .",
    "since the shapes of the exposure functions are not identical in the overlapping region , the observed energy spectra are not expected to be identical in case of anisotropies . for small anisotropies",
    "however , this guiding idea can nevertheless be implemented in an iterative algorithm delivering finally estimates of the relative exposures and of the multipole coefficients at the same time .",
    "the uncertainties on the recovered coefficients , however , are larger than expected from equation  [ eqn : rms_alm_bis ] due to the effect of the uncertainty in the relative exposures of the two experiments .",
    "this propagation of uncertainty mainly impacts the resolution in the dipole coefficient related to variations of the flux in declination .",
    "eev smoothed out at a 60@xmath38 angular scale , in km@xmath6  yr@xmath7  sr@xmath7 units  @xcite.,width=384 ]    the resulting entire mapping of the celestial sphere has revealed a dipole moment with an amplitude @xmath189 , captured with a chance probability of @xmath190  @xcite .",
    "no other deviation from isotropy has been observed at smaller angular scales .",
    "the recovered moment can be visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap_augerta ] , where the average flux smoothed out at an angular scale of @xmath191 per solid angle unit is displayed using the mollweide projection , in km@xmath6  yr@xmath7  sr@xmath7 units . this map is drawn in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the direction of the reconstructed dipole is shown as the white star .",
    "large - scale anisotropies of crs with energies in excess of @xmath13eev are closely connected to the sources and the propagation mode of extragalactic uhecrs , see _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite . due to scattering in the extragalactic magnetic fields ,",
    "large deflections are expected even at such high energies for field amplitudes in the nanogauss range and extended over coherence lengths of the order of one megaparsec , or even for lower amplitudes if the electric charge of uhecrs is large . for sources distributed in a way similar to the matter in the universe , the angular distribution of uhecrs",
    "is then expected to be influenced by the contribution of nearby sources , so that the milky way should be embedded into a density gradient of crs that should lead to at least a dipole moment .",
    "the contribution of nearby sources is even expected to become dominant as the energy of crs increases due to the reduction of the horizon of uhecrs induced by energy losses that are more important at higher energies .",
    "once folded through the galactic magnetic field , the dipole pattern expected from this mechanism is transformed into a more complex structure presumably described by a lower dipole amplitude and higher - order multipoles . however , in these scenarios , the dipole moment could remain the only one within reach given the sensitivity of the current generation of experiments .",
    "on the other hand , the detection of significant multipole moments beyond the dipole could be suggestive of non - diffusive propagation of uhecrs from sources distributed in a non - isotropic way .",
    "at ultra - high energies , the popular tropism that cosmic - ray astronomy may be feasible relies on two assumptions : on the possibility that the messengers have high enough rigidities to beat the magnetic blurring , and that the reduced particle horizons caused by energy losses eliminate or suppress the isotropic background from distant sources . however , for the same reason , the pattern recognition of the astrophysical sites harboring the accelerators which could be performed from uhecr arrival directions is made difficult by the very small intensity of these particles .",
    "it is also possible that the rigidity of the particles is not sufficient : properties of intervening magnetic fields are uncertain , and the mass composition of uhecrs in the highest - energy region remains largely unknown .",
    "thorough searches for various possible anisotropies of uhecrs conducted by the pierre auger and telescope array collaborations during the past decade have been summarized in this review .",
    "the data show a remarkable degree of isotropy at all energies , with only a few hints on a possible anisotropic distribution , like large - scale patterns in the eev energy range , and the concentration of events ( the hot spot ) in the northern hemisphere at the highest energies @xmath45  eev ( ta energy scale ) .",
    "the large - scale pattern above @xmath192eev ( auger energy scale ) is best revealed through the first harmonic analysis in right ascension of the auger data .",
    "these indications still require confirmation with larger statistics .    with the data above @xmath193  eev released by both collaborations , it is worth mentioning that other explorations of possible indications of anisotropies were performed by numerous authors outside of these collaborations which were not covered in this review , _",
    "e.g. _ searches for clustering of events  @xcite ; searches for correlations with extragalactic matter  @xcite ; studies of the lensing effect of the galactic magnetic field to probe whether the observed arrival directions could correlate with extragalactic objects once unfolded  @xcite ; and others .",
    "overall , although a few intriguing correlations with positions in the sky tracing special astrophysical environments have been uncovered , none of the corresponding significances is large enough to provide a compelling signal of anisotropy at present , especially in view of the multiple searches conducted .",
    "the apparent isotropy can be explained by several factors .",
    "one of them is the possibility that uhecrs are composed of a mix of light and intermediate / heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field in the halo of the galaxy may be underestimated due to the low density of electrons in these regions , so that even for protons , the magnetic deflections could still be large at the highest energies .",
    "the extragalactic fields , though bound by @xmath194  ng at large scales , may be larger in the @xmath194  mpc vicinity of our galaxy in case it is embedded in a filament .",
    "the absence of obvious bright sources on the uhecr sky , if not due to large magnetic deflections , may indicate that the sources are too numerous and individually weak .",
    "this can be quantified by setting lower bounds on the density of sources .",
    "roughly , the absence of repeaters implies that the number of contributing sources has to be larger than the square of the number of events @xcite . using the events above 70  eev detected at the auger observatory , the best up - to - date derived bounds , whose",
    "validity domains are limited for magnetic deflections smaller than the angular scale @xmath46 used to search for the repeaters , range from @xmath195mpc@xmath196 at @xmath197 up to @xmath198mpc@xmath196 at @xmath199  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the density of galaxies is roughly @xmath200mpc@xmath196 .",
    "first attempts to get at full - sky surveys at ultra - high energies are being developed between the two collaborations .",
    "the full - sky coverage is obviously advantageous to probe all possible sources of uhecrs , and is indispensable for the harmonic analysis aimed at revealing possible anisotropies at large angular scales .",
    "also , a multi - messenger approach could give clues for deciphering the origin of the cosmic ray particles .",
    "in this context , a full - sky study conducted in a collaboration among auger , telescope array and icecube , has recently reported on the search for correlations between uhecrs and very high - energy neutrino candidates detected by icecube  @xcite . it is interesting that the smallest post - trial @xmath54-values ( corresponding to significances slightly greater than @xmath201 ) are obtained when considering the correlations between the directions of cascade events observed by icecube and those of the uhecrs on an angular scale of @xmath202 . with increased statistics ,",
    "this kind of meta - analysis will help to understand whether or not a contribution to the neutrino signal observed by icecube arises from the sources of the observed uhecrs .",
    "present detector exposures are already providing us with important constraints on the origin of uhecrs .",
    "even larger exposures will lead to much better constraints and hopefully will eventually make possible the detection of the brightest sources .",
    "the telescope array collaboration is building an extension of the surface detector array , reaching a detection surface of about @xmath203km@xmath10 .",
    "this will boost the uhecr statistics in the northern hemisphere which , apart from the sensitivity to sources in the northern sky , is crucial for the all - sky surveys . at the auger observatory ,",
    "an upgraded instrumentation is being deployed to equip the detectors with an additional plane of 4  m@xmath10 of plastic scintillators above each station .",
    "this will provide us with additional high - statistics measurements of the showers , helping to produce composition - sensitive observables in an energy range including the highest energies , and will open a possibility to perform mass - discriminated anisotropy searches if the composition is mixed with light and heavy elements  @xcite .",
    "the operation of such an upgraded array is anticipated between 2018 and 2024 .",
