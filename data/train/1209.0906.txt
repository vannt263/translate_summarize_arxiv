    "therefore , the tle array coupled to radiation fields can be interpreted as a dicke state @xmath13 coupled to a lorentzian - like continuum , as shown in fig .",

    "the remaining part of the dos which does not fit the lorenzian distribution can be treated as an effective excitonic polarization decay .      to show that this effect can be realized in a solid - state environment we consider in detail how to use a multiple - quantum - well ( mqw ) structure as the two - level - emitter array .",
    "in such a mqw structure , each single quantum well can be regarded as a two - level emitter .",
    "the quantum - well exciton will be confined in the growth direction ( chosen to be _",
    "z_-axis ) and free to move in the _ x_-_y_-plane .",
    "due to the relaxation of momentum conservation in the _",
    "z_-axis , the coupling between the photon fields and the quantum wells is one - dimensional .",

    "z_-axis , the interacting hamiltonian can be written exactly the same as the form in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "furthermore , quantum wells have the remarkable advantage that the phase factor @xmath52 in @xmath35 can be fixed during the quantum - well growth process , and since the photon fields travel in mqw only along the _",
    "z_-axis , a one - dimensional waveguide is not required .    to elaborate on the physical parameters necessary to realize the single - photon dicke state we assume a mqw structure with a period of 400 nm , where each quantum well consists of one gaas layer of thickness 5 nm ( sandwiched between two algaas slabs ) .",
    "the exciton energy @xmath53 of a single quantum well can take the value@xcite we utilized in fig .  1 ( i.e. , 1.514 ev ) , such that the resonant photon wavelength @xmath54 820 nm .",
    "to realize the dicke state at all we already demanded that the photon be off - resonance with the array . in principle",
    "the on - resonance regime can be reached by tuning the quantum well array energies after the dicke state has been realized . to identify when the state has been created a pair of identical photons with wavevector @xmath2 are produced by the two - photon down - conversion crystal , as shown in fig .",
    "one of the photons is directed to the detector-1 ( d1 ) and the other is along the growth direction of the mqw .",
    "the distance between the crystal and d1 is arranged to be the same as that between the crystal and the mqw .",
    "once there is a click in d1 , there should be one photon simultaneously sent into the mqw .",
    "the photon incident on the mqw generally passes through the mqw and registers a count in detector-2 ( d2 ) , but it could also excite one of the multiple quantum wells and form a delocalized exciton .",
    "the presence of a count in d1 and the absence of a count in d2 therefore tells us that the mqw has been prepared in the superposition state @xmath35 . since the interaction between the photon fields and the mqw structure is identical with eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , the exciton dynamics of the @xmath35 and the density of states of the photon fields in mqw can show the same behaviors as those in fig .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) ( here one unit of time is @xmath55 picosecond ) when the mqw contains corresponding number @xmath1 of the quantum wells .    for a mqw structure containing a large number of quantum wells (",
    "i.e. , @xmath56 ) , the dynamical evolution of the superposition state @xmath35 shows rabi - like oscillations .",
    "however , one should note that the rabi - like oscillations here are different from the rabi oscillations reported in secondary emission spectra@xcite of excitons in the mqw structures .",
    "the secondary emission occurs when the mqw is illuminated by coherent light , and emission occurs in a direction different from the excitation direction .",
    "however , in our system , the incident excitation is a _ single photon _ , and the detector-2",
    "( see fig .",
    "3 ) receiving the emitted photon is positioned along the excitation direction .",
    "furthermore , the mqw system we consider is bragg - arranged ( i.e. , the inter - well spacing equals half the wavelength of light at the exciton frequency ) , for which the rabi oscillations in secondary emission can not appear@xcite .",
    "therefore , the rabi - like oscillations in fig .",
    "1(c ) are different from those in secondary emission but are a result of the coherent oscillations between the delocalized exciton state @xmath13 and the resonant photon state @xmath51 .      while we have argued that the oscillations one would observe in this large mirror - less cavity are quantum - mechanical in nature ( akin to vacuum rabi splitting )",
    ", there is still some ambiguity . in the earlier work of svidzinsky _",
    "@xcite they employ a semi - classical explanation of a similar phenomena .",
    "thus the question remains open as to whether @xmath57 can truly be considered a single resonant state with neglible phase decoherence , and whether the dicke state retains its long - range spatial coherent nature on a sufficient time - scale .",
    "there may be alternative classical and semi - classical explanations of the oscillations one may see in experiment .",
    "similar problems were overcome in the field of cavity and circuit - qed by observation of other quantum features ( e.g. , the scaling of the energy spectrum@xcite ) .",
    "however , in quantum wells we are restricted to certain types of measurements .",
    "recently , great advances have been made in measuring the excitonic states in quantum wells via four - wave mixing techniques@xcite .",
    "we can also , in principle , make measurements on the emitted photons ( e.g. , as in fig .",
    "3 ) . as a first test one could measure the emitted photons at d2 to verify the single - particle nature of the dynamics with a simple violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality@xcite , or observation of anti - bunching .",
    "we will not go into detail on this here , but essentially it corresponds to the detection of only single - photons .",
    "in other words , after we detect the single photon at d2 , no more measurements will occur until another photon is injected into the sample .",
    "this is a trivial application of the cauchy - schwartz inequality , but indicates that we are operating in the single - excitation limit .    in order to verify the quantum coherence of the delocalized state in the mqw",
    "rigorously one could apply a test like the leggett - garg ( lg ) inequality@xcite .",
    "the lg inequality depends on the fact that at a macroscopic level several assumptions about our observations of classical reality can be made : realism , locality , and the possibility of non - invasive measurement . in 1985 ,",
    "leggett and garg derived their inequality@xcite to test the first and last assumptions , which when combined they called `` macroscopic realism '' .",
    "the experimental violations of this inequality in a `` macroscopic '' superconducting circuit@xcite , polarized photon state@xcite , electron - nuclear spin pairs@xcite , have recently been seen .",
    "given a dichotomic observable @xmath58 , which is bound by @xmath59 , the leggett - garg inequality is : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "a violation of this inequality suggests either the assumption of realism or of non - invasive measurements is being broken .    to apply this to the system we have been discussing we must formalize further how",
    ", for large @xmath1 , the mqw system can be mapped to an effective two - level system [ as shown in fig .",
    "the dynamics of this effective model can be described by a markovian master equation : @xmath63=\\frac{1}{i\\hbar}[\\widetilde{h}_{\\textrm{eff}},\\rho]+\\sigma[\\rho ] , \\label{liou}\\ ] ] where @xmath64=&\\kappa(s\\rho s^{\\dag}-\\frac{1}{2}s^{\\dag}s\\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho s^{\\dag}s)+\\gamma(r\\rho r^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}r^{\\dagger}r\\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho r^{\\dagger}r ) .",

    "the state @xmath69 is the vacuum state which in the full basis is @xmath70 , i.e. no excitation in the dicke state or in the resonant state @xmath2 . in the self - energy @xmath71 $ ] ,",
    "the @xmath72 operators describe the loss of the photon from the mqw system with rate @xmath73 , and the @xmath74 . with this master equation , in fig .",
    "4(a ) we plot @xmath75 using the observable@xcite , @xmath76 considerable violations ( @xmath77 ) of the lg inequality [ eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) ] appear in the region above the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "the violations resulting from the quantum oscillations between the states @xmath13 and @xmath51 indicate the quantum coherence of the delocalized state in the mqw structure .",
    "a direct application of this inequality to the example of a quantum well array seems extremely challenging because the measurement of a photon leaving the system , and the four - wave mixing measurements of the excitonic states @xcite , are fundamentally invasive . to test the inequality unambiguously",
    "would require a fast projective ( quantum non - demolition ) measurement of the single photon state @xmath57 , or the dicke state @xmath78 .",
    "such measurements are now in principle possible in optical@xcite and microwave @xcite cavities , but not in the effective cavity we describe here",
    ".    some progress can be made by making further assumptions .",
    "it was shown by huelga et al@xcite and others@xcite that the assumption of markovian dynamics eliminates the need to assume non - invasive measurement if we can reliably prepare the system in a desired state ( then the invasive nature of the second measurement , e.g. , because of the destruction of the photon , does not affect the inequality ) . under this markovian assumption",
    "the inequality can be written in terms of population measurements of the state we wish to measure ( which in general we describe as a single - state projective operator @xmath79 , for some measurable state of the system @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the expectation value of the zero - time population @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the two - time correlation function .",
    "note that if the zero - time state is the steady state then this is equivalent to the original@xcite lg inequality , but again demands non - invasive measurements .",
    "if the zero - time state is not the steady state , but some prepared state e.g. @xmath85 , @xmath86 , then a violation of this variant of the leggett - garg inequality indicates behaviour only beyond a classical markovian regime , i.e. a strong indication of the quantumness of this delocalized state , though not irrefutable proof .",
    "we now consider the above inequality in two different regimes .",
    "if we can deterministically prepare the state @xmath87 ( dropping the @xmath2 subscript for brevity ) as described in fig .  3 , we can construct the inequality ( eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) ) with @xmath88 by preparing that state so @xmath89 , and then ( invasively ) measuring the state of the quantum wells at time @xmath7 later ( see below ) .",
    "this is then equivalent to the test to eliminate purely markovian dynamics@xcite .",
    "in general such a measurement will be invasive ( and can generally be described by some positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) ) , but since we are not concerned with events after the second measurement , we can just assume that it is proportional to the probability of obtaining the dicke state @xmath87 at that time .",
    "in other words , we can assume the second measurement is just a normal projective measurement , @xmath90 .",

    "4(b ) , we plot @xmath93 as a function of time ( solid black curve ) .",
    "the behavior is oscillatory but damped due to the couplings to the markovian photon dissipation and the excitonic polarization decay .",
    "a considerable violation @xmath94 of the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) appears in the region above the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "the violation there comes from the coherent oscillations between the states @xmath95 and @xmath51 , and is beyond the classical markovian description .",
    "the dicke state @xmath87 describes a particular coherent superposition of a single excitation across all @xmath1 quantum wells .",
    "it has been shown that four - wave mixing and pump probe techniques @xcite can be used to measure the state of multiple excitations across multiple wells .",
    "thus it seems feasible that such an experiment can be used to determine the excitation density .",
    "if we assume that only the @xmath87 plays a role here , and the other dicke states ( @xmath96 ) are unoccupied , then this is sufficient for our purposes , as it will tell us if the array contains a single excitation or not .",
    "however , whether the @xmath87 can be in general distinguished from the other dicke states with such a measurement is an interesting open problem , and requires further study .",
    "similarly , if we could deterministically prepare the state @xmath57 , we could construct the inequality ( eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) , with @xmath97 ) by preparing that state ( so @xmath98 , and then measuring when a single photon is detected at detector d2 . the second measurement needed to construct the correlation functions in eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) is then simply given by the superoperator @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the vacuum state .",
    "again , we can assume the second measurement is just a normal projective measurement ( after rescaling by @xmath73 ) , @xmath101 .",
    "thus , while the photon measurement is much simpler than the quantum well one described earlier , in our scheme it is not clear if we can determinstically know when @xmath57 is created in the same way that @xmath87 is , as @xmath57 is an effective state of the field modes . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we plot @xmath102 as a function of time ( dashed red curve ) .",
    "again a considerable violation @xmath94 of the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) appears , and indicates behavior beyond the classical markovian description .    of course ,",
    "ultimately we can not distinguish classical non - markovian dynamics from quantum dynamics with this method , though certain complex markovian systems can produce non - monotonic and complex behavior@xcite which it is important to eliminate . to really show that the large array of quantum wells is behaving like a cavity without a mirror and exhibiting quantum rabi oscillations",
    "more work needs to be done on full state tomography techniques and precise measurements of excitonic states , so that either the full leggett - garg inequality , or some other test , can be investigated .",
    "in summary , we investigated the dynamical evolution of the delocalized state of a two - level - emitter array state .",
    "when the array contains a large number of emitters , the dynamical evolution shows rabi - like oscillatory behavior . by showing that the dos of the radiation field in the tle array is lorentzian - like",
    ", the whole system can be mapped to an effective two - level system ( e.g. , like a single excitation cavity - qed system ) . for the physical implementation we suggested a multiple - quantum - well structure and discussed relevant parameters .",
    "we also applied the original leggett - garg inequality , and a markovian variation of it , to examine the quantum coherence of the mqw structure .",
    "in addition to the mqw structure , there are other experimentally - accessible systems that can mediate one - dimensional coupling between two - level emitters and the photon fields .",
    "below we provide two potential candidates :    ( i. ) _ metal nanowire _ :  @xmath1 two - level quantum dots positioned near a metal nanowire@xcite as shown in fig .",

    "<S> this effect is generally characterized by an enhanced emission intensity that scales as the square of the number of atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a particularly interesting consequence of this cooperative interaction was discussed by svidzinsky _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite . in their work </S>",
    "<S> they showed that there could be cooperative delocalized effects even when just a single photon is injected into a large cloud of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the state that is created via this mechanism is a highly - entangled dicke state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting open question is if such a state can be realized and manipulated in a solid - state environment .    to answer this question we analyze what happens when a single - photon is injected into a large _ one - dimensional _ array of two - level - emitters ( tle ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that because of the cooperative interaction between light and matter the structure acts like an effective optical cavity without mirrors@xcite , and realizes a one - dimensional variation of the dicke - state discussed by svidzinsky _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the delocalized state formed in this emitter - array can exhibit quantum behaviour through the coherent oscillatory dynamics of the state . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how such a phenomenon might be realized in a multiple - quantum - well ( mqw ) array and discuss physically - realistic parameters . to show how the quantum features of such an experiment might be verified , we apply the leggett - garg ( lg ) inequality@xcite , and a markovian extension@xcite , to examine the quantum coherence of the delocalized state over the mqw structure . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss two other potential candidates for experimental realization . </S>"
