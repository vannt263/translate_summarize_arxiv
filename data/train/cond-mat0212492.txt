    "let us start with a trivial but important remark on measurement in quantum mechanics : in general a single measurement on an @xmath0-particle system is neither equivalent to many measurements on the @xmath0-particle system , nor to @xmath0 measurements on @xmath0 one - particle systems .",
    "the only exception is the case of a product @xmath0-particle state where all particles are described by the same single - particle wavefunction .",
    "not surprisingly the particles must be bosons forming a bose - einstein condensate , and a measurement on this @xmath0-particle state can be replaced with @xmath0 measurements on @xmath0 one - particle systems in the same single - particle wavefunction .",
    "the importance of this `` nonequivalence '' principle can be seen in the explanation of an interference experiment ref.@xcite in an excellent paper by javanainen and yoo @xcite , and then elaborated in refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors consider a fock state @xmath1 with @xmath2 atoms in a condensate of wavefunction @xmath3 and @xmath2 in a condensate with an orthogonal wavefunction @xmath4 .",
    "a single particle density matrix of the state ( [ n/2 ] ) predicts that on average a density measurement will give a distribution of atoms @xmath5 without any interference fringes between the two condensates .",
    "this single particle distribution is an average over many density measurements on the same fock state ( [ n/2 ] ) .",
    "simulation of a destructive density measurement @xcite based on the full @xmath0-particle wavefunction ( [ n/2 ] ) , and the actual experiment @xcite , give distributions with an interference term @xmath6 for a given experimental realization the phase @xmath7 is chosen randomly from the interval @xmath8 .",
    "the outcome of a density measurement is the same as if before the measurement all @xmath0 atoms were not in the state ( [ fock ] ) but in an absurd single condensate with a wavefunction @xmath9 with a relative phase @xmath7 that is not known before we actually measure the density distribution .",
    "it turns out @xcite that it is enough to measure only a small fraction of the large total @xmath0 to prepare the remaining atoms in one of the condensate wavefunctions ( [ jyvarphi ] ) , or , in other words , to establish a definite phase @xmath7 .",
    "destructive measurement of atomic positions , which effectively annihilates measured atoms from the trap , drives the remaining atoms into a condensate state with a randomly picked condensate wavefunction .",
    "these interesting conclusions can not be obtained without full knowledge of the @xmath0-particle state ( [ n/2 ] ) : the single particle density distribution ( [ jysingle ] ) is a ( misleading ) average over many experiments with different outcomes @xmath7 . to predict possible outcomes of individual measurements on an @xmath0-particle state",
    "it is essential to know its @xmath0-particle wavefunction .",
    "a perfect condensate is a state where all @xmath0 atoms are in the same single particle state described by a single particle wavefunction @xmath10 , @xmath11 when we include interactions between atoms but neglect depletion of atoms from the condensate wavefunction , then @xmath12 is a solution of the celebrated gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "including small quantum depletion in the framework of the number - conserving bogoliubov theory @xcite leads to pair- correlated eigenstates @xcite .",
    "for example , the state without any quasiparticles ( the bogoliubov vacuum ) has a pair - correlated form @xmath13 operators @xmath14 annihilate in a basis of functions @xmath15 orthogonal to the condensate wavefunction @xmath12 .",
    "this general pair - correlated ansatz ( [ z1 ] ) has been known for a while , see e.g. the review by leggett @xcite , but a general solution for the coefficients @xmath16 and corresponding wavefunctions @xmath15 has been found only very recently in ref.@xcite ( the solution in the special case of a uniform condensate was given in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the two - particle creation operator @xmath17 has to commute with all quasiparticle annihilation operators ( see appendix a ) @xmath18=0 , \\ ; \\mbox{for all}\\ ; m.\\ ] ] the @xmath0-particle state ( [ z1 ] ) is a foundation on which one can build theory of bec entirely in the language of @xmath0-particle wavefunctions .    in our two recent papers @xcite we studied depletion from a condensate with a dark soliton",
    "the dark soliton state is a collectively excited condensate with a notch in the condensate wavefunction . in the thomas - fermi limit of strong interactions",
    "the notch behaves like a soliton with a wavefunction close to the notch proportional to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a position of the soliton measured in units of the healing length .",
    "the anomalous bogoliubov mode with a wavefunction @xmath21 dominates quantum depletion from the condensate within the soliton . in ref.@xcite",
    "we found an average number of atoms @xmath22 depleted into the non - condensate mode @xmath23 and a single particle density distribution which close to the soliton at @xmath24 looks like @xmath25 for @xmath26 the distribution has a hole at @xmath24 , but with increasing quantum depletion @xmath22 the hole is filling with atoms .",
    "this single particle result means that on average over many experiments the notch of a depleted dark soliton appears filled with atoms ( it appears grey , not dark ) , but it gives no clue what to expect as an outcome of a single destructive density measurement .",
    "we address this issue in the following sections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ darktf],[darknd],[darkgns ] we apply the number conserving bogoliubov theory ( shortly summarized in appendix a ) to the dark soliton , and simulate density measurement on different @xmath0-particle quantum states that all may pass under the same label : `` depleted dark soliton '' .",
    "we find that images of the `` depleted dark soliton '' depend qualitatively on the actual @xmath0-particle state .",
    "to simulate the measurements we adapted the numerical algorithm of ref.@xcite which is described in appendix b. we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the dark soliton state @xcite of a condensate in a 1d harmonic trap can be defined as an antisymmetric solution of the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath27 in this paper we use the dimensionless oscillator units . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) limit of @xmath28 the dark soliton state",
    "is @xmath29 with @xmath30 where the chemical potential @xmath31 and the healing length @xmath32 .",
    "a perfect condensate with all @xmath0 atoms in the dark soliton mode @xmath12 is not an energy eigenstate because interactions between atoms continuously deplete atoms from the condensate wavefunction @xmath12 .",
    "the bogoliubov theory is a systematic way to describe small quantum fluctuations around the gross - pitaevskii solution , and to find stationary states of a depleted condensate .",
    "solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations ( see appendix a ) reveals many different modes of the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "however , only the negative energy ( anomalous ) mode ( [ modex ] ) has a wavefunction localized in the soliton notch @xcite .",
    "> from all modes the anomalous mode will contribute the most to the density of incoherent atoms in the soliton notch . in the following , similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we truncate the bogoliubov spectrum to the anomalous mode alone and look for the bogoliubov vacuum state in the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 creating in the mode @xmath23 .",
    "the anomalous mode solution of the bdg equations ( [ bdg ] ) with @xmath35 is @xmath36 with functions @xmath37 see ref.@xcite . for @xmath28 equations ( [ uvs ] )",
    "are dominated by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the two functions become the same , @xmath40 . as a result in the tf limit",
    "the anomalous mode does not mix with other modes and the dominant eigenfunction is @xmath41 as has been verified numerically in ref.@xcite . to find the asymptotic behavior of @xmath42 for @xmath28 we have to be more careful and still keep @xmath43 for a moment .",
    "the eigenvalue can be obtained from the general prescription presented in appendix  a and it is @xmath44 knowing @xmath42 we can find an average number of depleted atoms @xmath22 in the bogoliubov vacuum state ( [ zds ] ) . in the particle fock representation",
    "the unnormalized vacuum state ( [ zds ] ) is a sum @xmath45 for depletion greater than unity but small with respect to the total number of atoms @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath46 , we may use the stirling formula , and then replace the sum by an integral . as a result we find expressions for @xmath22 and its dispersion @xmath47 @xmath48    the single particle density distribution in the vacuum state ( [ zds],[solz ] ) is @xmath49 the first term on the rhs is the dark soliton density profile with a hole at @xmath50 , while the second one stands for the depleted atoms localized in the soliton notch .",
    "a good measure of depletion is a ratio of atomic density in the notch at @xmath50 to the density near the notch @xmath51 suggesting that for sufficiently large number of atoms , the notch will not be visible . for the parameters of the hannover experiment @xcite , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 atoms and the ratio is @xmath55 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ singss ] ) predicts an average over many experimental realizations . for a single experiment one",
    "has to choose randomly positions of @xmath0 atoms according to the @xmath0-particle probability distribution . in general",
    "this is rather a formidable task , but , as shown by javanainen and yoo @xcite ( see appendix  b ) , for a state spanned on only two modes , and with a sequential algorithm that chooses a position of @xmath56-st atom after positions of @xmath57 atoms have already been `` measured '' , this problem is polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "in general we expect that a single measurement of a depleted dark soliton will show the same atomic density distribution as if all @xmath0 atoms were initially prepared in a condensate with one of wavefunctions @xmath58 the real parameters @xmath59 are chosen at random and fluctuate from experiment to experiment . in the special case of @xmath60 the condensate wavefunction ( [ qvarphi ] )",

    "[ fig2 ] we show how definite values of @xmath70 and @xmath64 are established in the course of measurement of subsequent atomic positions . it is enough to measure only a small fraction of atoms to suppress fluctuations of @xmath7 and @xmath64 , see fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "( upper plot ) and @xmath64 during the density measurement performed on the state @xmath71.,width=325 ]    a density measurement of the bogoliubov vacuum state ( [ zds],[solz ] ) always gives a displaced dark soliton with @xmath72 in eq.([qvarphi ] ) . at first sight",
    "this may seem obvious because the wavefunctions @xmath12 and @xmath23 are real , and all amplitudes in the state ( [ solz ] ) are also real .",
    "however , this simple argument does not take into account the possibility that the measurement of a small fraction of atoms may localize the state of remaining atoms not in a single condensate ( [ qvarphi ] ) , but in a superposition of several condensates @xcite with different parameters @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , as we can see in eq.([qphi ] ) , density distributions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the same so the density measurement can not distinguish @xmath75 from @xmath76 .",
    "a real superposition of two condensates with opposite phases has real amplitudes , just like the state ( [ solz ] ) .",
    "we checked that a measurement of a fock state @xmath77 , instead of the bogoliubov vacuum state ( [ zds],[solz ] ) , indeed results in a real superposition of two condensates with nonzero @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which appears as a displaced grey soliton .",
    "what makes a difference is the fact the bogoliubov vacuum ( [ solz ] ) is a superposition over many fock states .",
    "it is the phase coherence between different fock states , all with real amplitudes , that enforces the observed @xmath72 .",
    "in current experiments @xcite the dark solitons are generated with the help of the phase imprinting @xcite . as we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the depletion in the condensate before the imprinting is negligible , then the soliton state right after imprinting can be idealized by the state without any atoms depleted from the solitonic condensate @xmath12 to the anomalous mode @xmath23 , @xmath78 this state is not a stationary state . to obtain time evolution of this state",
    "we consequently truncate the bogoliubov hamiltonian to the anomalous mode where @xmath79 with @xmath80 with this hamiltonian the initial perfect condensate @xmath81 evolves    , eq .",

    "[ singps ] we show how a single particle density evolves in time . after about 15  ms ( for the parameters of the hannover experiment @xcite ) the hole in the single particle density distribution fills up with depleted atoms .",
    "we simulated single realizations of destructive density measurements of the state @xmath82 . a generic density distribution after evolution for 10  ms is shown in fig .",
    "[ histps ] .",
    "we see that the soliton is dark and it is displaced with respect to the trap center .",
    "but for the state @xmath83.,width=325 ]    inspection of the state after 10  ms shows that @xmath84 with a tiny @xmath85 . in principle",
    "the time evolution might generate any phase @xmath86 , but the parameters of the experiment @xcite are such that there is not enough time to get any more significant @xmath7 from the idealized initial state ( [ initps ] ) before the linearized bogoliubov theory breaks down .",
    "in a realistic experiment the dark soliton is created in neither the stationary nor the zero depletion state discussed in the previous two sections .",
    "the two states may appear `` natural '' to a theorist s eye accustomed to such highly idealized examples .",
    "however , these states are not realistic from experimental point of view .",
    "the soliton is phase imprinted on a condensate with a @xmath87 thermal cloud i.e. in a highly excited non - stationary state .",
    "we do not know what the actual state , or ensemble of states , is , but we can still test how robust is the picture developed in the previous sections with respect to imperfections of the quantum state .    to get an idea what are images of a generic non - stationary state we model the state by a state with random phases .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is diagonal in the fock basis of _ quasiparticles _ so we expect a generic non - stationary state in to have apparently random phases in _ particle _ fock representation . to be more specific ,",
    "we take as an example the bogoliubov vacuum ( [ solz ] ) with randomized phases @xmath88 , @xmath89 single particle density in this state is exactly the same as for the bogoliubov vacuum , see eq .",
    "( [ singss ] ) , but possible outcomes of density measurements can be very different in the two states .",

    "not surprisingly , we again see a displaced grey soliton , this time with @xmath93 .",
    "but for the state @xmath90 after evolution over 0.7  ms.,width=325 ]    these two examples demonstrate that phase disorder in particle fock representation can change qualitatively possible results of density measurements .",
    "in refs.@xcite we have considered influence of quantum fluctuations on a density profile of a bose - einstein condensate excited to a solitonic state .",
    "we have shown that the soliton notch may be filled with atoms that are depleted from the condensate due to interactions between particles .",
    "the analysis has been performed by calculating a single particle density matrix .",
    "however , such a matrix provides informations about the density profile that is a result of average over many experimental realizations . to obtain predictions for a single experimental realization one has to choose randomly positions of atoms according to the multiparticle probability density .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of outcome of the destructive density measurement in a single experiment . applying the number conserving bogoliubov theory of a bec",
    "we calculate @xmath0-particle quantum states of a depleted condensate with a dark soliton .",
    "the @xmath0-particle wavefunctions are used to see what happens after the depleted condensate is subject to an ideal destructive ( density ) measurement of atomic positions .",
    "we have found that :    * for a bec excited to a stationary state , i.e. the bogoliubov vacuum state without any quasiparticles , a destructive measurement reveals density distribution which appears like a displaced * dark * soliton with an empty notch .",
    "average displacement is proportional to the average number of incoherent atoms in the notch .",
    "* for the non - stationary state that evolves from an initial state without any incoherent atoms in the soliton notch ( i.e. a perfect condensate with a dark soliton ) a destructive measurement reveals , similarly like in the previous case , a displaced * dark * soliton .",
    "the longer the evolution lasts the larger the depletion of the condensate becomes ( and thus also average displacement of the soliton ) . *",
    "the previous two cases are related to highly idealized states of a bec . to analyze influence of imperfections ( in the preparation of the soliton condensate ) on the result of density measurement we introduced random phases in amplitudes of different fock states corresponding to the bogoliubov vacuum state .",
    "in such a non - stationary state the measurement reveals a displaced * grey * soliton .",
    "both the average displacement and the average density of atoms in the notch of this * grey * soliton are proportional to the number of atoms depleted from the condensate .",
    "very different @xmath0-particle quantum states may correspond to the same single particle density matrix .",
    "however , different states result in qualitatively different results of destructive density measurements . in view of the strong dependence of measurement results on a quantum state",
    ", it is an open question what @xmath0-particle state is relevant for the present day dark soliton experiments @xcite .",
    "the phase imprinting method @xcite prepares neither an energy eigenstate nor the initial state without any depleted atoms .",
    "certainly , further experiments would be helpful to settle this problem .",
    "quantum fluctuations of a condensate are an intriguing result of interatomic interactions that introduce two - particle and higher correlations into the state of the system .",
    "bec as a correlated system might be a very interesting toy model for condensed matter physics .",
    "depletion to the notch of the dark soliton gives a unique opportunity to detect quantum fluctuations simply by density measurement .",

    "<S> the dark soliton created in a bose - einstein condensate becomes grey in course of time evolution because its notch fills up with depleted atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this is the result of quantum mechanical calculations which describes output of many experimental repetitions of creation of the stationary soliton , and its time evolution terminated by a destructive density measurement . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a description is not suitable to predict the outcome of a single realization of the experiment were two extreme scenarios and many combinations thereof are possible : one will see ( 1 ) a _ displaced dark soliton _ without any atoms in the notch , but with a randomly displaced position , or ( 2 ) a _ grey soliton _ with a fixed position , but a random number of atoms filling its notch . in either case the average over many realizations will reproduce the mentioned quantum mechanical result . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we use @xmath0-particle wavefunctions , which follow from the number - conserving bogoliubov theory , to settle this issue .    </S>",
