    "in the present talk , i will report about a recent study of the process @xmath2 , also known as @xmath3 reaction  @xcite .",
    "this process has recently received considerable attention  @xcite , triggered by the results presented by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) collaboration of the energy spectrum of electrons recoiling from scattering with solar neutrinos .",
    "in fact , while over most of the spectrum , a constant suppression of about 0.5 is observed relative to the standard solar model ( ssm ) predictions  @xcite , above 12.5 mev there is an apparent excess of events . accordingly with the ssm , the @xmath3 reaction is the only source of solar neutrinos with energy higher than 14 mev ( their end - point is about 19 mev ) .",
    "this fact has led to questions about the reliability of the calculations of the @xmath3 reaction cross section , upon which the ssm bases its currently accepted value for the astrophysical @xmath0-factor , 2.3 @xmath4 kev b  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sk collaboration  @xcite has shown that a large enhancement , by a factor of about 17 , of the @xmath3 @xmath0-factor would essentially fit the observed excess of recoiling electrons .    the theoretical description of the @xmath3 process , as already known since long time , constitutes a challenging problem from the standpoint of nuclear few - body theory . in fact , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3 reaction is extremely sensitive to : ( i ) small components in the wave functions , in particular the d - state admixtures generated by the tensor interactions ; ( ii ) relativistic corrections and many - body terms in the weak transition operator ; ( iii ) p - wave capture contributions .",
    "the outline of the talk is as follow : i will first briefly review the main steps of the calculation , in particular discussing the method used to describe the initial and final state wave functions and the model of the weak transition operators .",
    "then i will present the @xmath0-factor results and discuss their implication for the sk solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "this section is divided in three parts : in subsection  [ subsec : xs ] , i first summarize all the relevant formulas for the @xmath3 astrophysical @xmath0-factor and the cross section ; a detailed description can be found in ref .  @xcite . in subsection  [ subsec : chh ] , i then discuss the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics method used to describe the initial and final state wave functions ; finally in subsection  [ subsec : cc ] , i present the model for the weak transition operator .      the astrophysical @xmath0-factor at center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath3 cross section and @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the fine structure constant and @xmath11 the @xmath12 relative velocity .",
    "the cross section @xmath7 is written as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 = 19.29 mev ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the proton , @xmath1 , and @xmath18 rest masses , respectively ) , and the transition amplitude is given by @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the fermi constant , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent , respectively , the @xmath12 scattering state with relative momentum @xmath24 and @xmath18 bound state recoiling with momentum @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the leptonic weak current , @xmath27 ( the lepton spinors are normalized as @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 is the nuclear weak current , @xmath30 .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude upon the spin projections of the leptons , proton and @xmath31he has been omitted for ease of presentation .",
    "the c.m .",
    "energies of interest involved in the @xmath12 weak capture reaction , are of the order of 10 kev : the energy at which the reaction is most probable to occur , known as the gamow - peak energy , is in fact 10.7 kev .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to expand the @xmath12 scattering state into partial waves , and perform a multipole decomposition of the nuclear weak charge , @xmath32 , and current , @xmath33 , operators .",
    "standard manipulations lead to  @xcite @xmath34 where the lepton tensor @xmath35 is written in terms of electron and neutrino four - velocities , while the nuclear tensor @xmath36 is given in terms of the reduced matrix elements ( rmes ) of the coulomb @xmath37 , longitudinal @xmath38 , transverse electric @xmath39 , and transverse magnetic @xmath40 multipole operators between the initial @xmath12 state with orbital angular momentum @xmath41 , channel spin @xmath0 ( @xmath0=0,1 ) , and total angular momentum @xmath42 , and final @xmath18 state .",
    "the present study includes s- and p - wave capture channels , i.e. the @xmath43s@xmath44 , @xmath31s@xmath45 , @xmath31p@xmath44 , @xmath43p@xmath45 , @xmath31p@xmath45 , and @xmath31p@xmath46 states , and retains all contributing multipoles connecting these states to the @xmath47=0@xmath48 ground state of @xmath18 .",
    "the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics ( chh ) method , developed for the four - body problem in refs .",
    "@xcite , has been used to calculated the bound- and scattering - state wave functions .",
    "i first describe the method for the @xmath18 wave function .      in the study of the four - nucleon systems",
    ", there are two sets of jacobi coordinates , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , corresponding to the partitions 1 + 3 and 2 + 2 , respectively ( note that by definition @xmath51 ) .",
    "their explicit expressions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the chh method ,",
    "the magnitudes of the jacobi variables are replaced by the so - called hyperspherical coordinates , which in the four - body case are given by : @xmath52 @xmath53 the @xmath18 wave function can be now expanded as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 are hyper - radial functions , yet to be determined , and @xmath56 are known functions , which contain all the spin , isospin , angle and hyper - angle dependence and a jastrow correlation factor .",
    "this factor accounts for the strong state - dependent correlations induced by the nucleon - nucleon interaction and improves the behaviour of the wave function at small interparticle distances , thus accelerating the convergence of the calculated quantities with respect to the number of required basis functions",
    ". the hyper - radial functions @xmath57 and the bound state energy @xmath5 are then obtained applying the rayleigh - ritz variational principle , @xmath58 .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath59 consists here of the argonne @xmath60 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - ix three - nucleon  @xcite interactions . to make contact with earlier studies  @xcite , however , and to have some estimate of the model dependence of the results , the older argonne @xmath61 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - viii three - nucleon  @xcite interaction models have also been used",
    "both these hamiltonians , the av18/uix and av14/uviii , reproduce the experimental binding energies and charge radii of the trinucleons and @xmath18 in exact green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) calculations  @xcite . the results of the @xmath18 binding energy calculated with the chh method are given in table  [ tb : be ] and compared with the gfmc values .",
    "depending on the hamiltonian model , the chh results  @xcite are within 12 % , of those obtained with the gfmc method .    .binding energies in mev of @xmath62he calculated with the chh method using the av18 and av18/uix , and the older av14 and av14/uviii , hamiltonian models .",
    "also listed are the corresponding exactgfmc results  @xcite and the experimental value . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : sfc_contr ]    by comparing the av18 and av18/uix results , it can be concluded that inclusion of the three - nucleon interaction reduces the total @xmath0-factor by about 20 % .",
    "this decrease is mostly in the @xmath31s@xmath45 contribution , and can be traced back to a corresponding reduction in the magnitude of the one - body axial current matrix elements .",
    "the latter are sensitive to the triplet scattering length , for which the av18 and av18/uix models predict , respectively , 10.0 fm and 9.13 fm ( see table  [ tb : scl ] ) .",
    "this 20 % difference in the total @xmath0-factor values for av18 and av18/uix emphasizes the need for performing the calculation using a hamiltonian model that reproduces the binding energies and low - energy scattering parameters for the three- and four - nucleon systems .",
    "this is true for the av18/uix model , but not for the av18 model .",
    "the different contributions to the astrophysical @xmath0-factor when the older av14/uviii potential model is used are given in the last column of table  [ tb : sfc_contr ] . by comparing these results with the ones obtained with the av18/uix , it can be observed that both the s- and p - wave contributions are not significantly changed ; in particular , the @xmath31s@xmath45 capture @xmath0-factor values differ for only about 3 % .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this is due to the procedure of constraining the model dependent two - body axial currents by fitting the gamow - teller matrix element of tritium @xmath63-decay , as discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "note that the av14/uviii hamiltonian also reproduces the low - energy properties for the three- and four - nucleon systems .",
    "the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment detects solar neutrinos by neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "it is sensitive , according to the ssm  @xcite , to the very energetic neutrinos from the @xmath64b weak decay ( @xmath65 ) and from the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "the sk results are presented as ratio of the measured to the ssm predicted events when no neutrino oscillations are included , as function of the recoil electron energy . over most of the spectrum ,",
    "this ratio is constant at @xmath66  @xcite . at the highest energies ,",
    "however , there is an excess of events relative to the @xmath67ssm prediction .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] where the sk results from 825 days of data acquisition  @xcite are shown by the points ( the error bars denote the combined statistical and systematic error ) ; the dotted line is the @xmath67ssm prediction .    to study the effects of the new value for the @xmath0-factor presented here , 10.1 @xmath4 kev  b ( see table  [ tb : sfact ] ) to the sk spectrum , it is useful to introduce the ratio @xmath10 of the @xmath3 flux to its ssm value , defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the observed suppression factor due to neutrino oscillations . therefore , if @xmath3 neutrino oscillations are ignored , then @xmath70 , while if the @xmath3 neutrinos are suppressed by @xmath66 , then @xmath71 . the long - dashed and solid lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratio ] indicate the effect of these two different values of @xmath10 on the ratio of the electron spectrum with both @xmath64b and @xmath3 to that with only @xmath64b ( the ssm ) .",
    "two other arbitrary values of @xmath10 ( 10 and 20 ) are shown for comparison .",
    "[ fig : ratio ]",
    "in this talk , i have reported about a recent new calculation of the astrophysical @xmath0-factor for the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "the chief conclusion of this calculation is that the best estimate for the @xmath0-factor at 10 kev , close to the gamow - peak energy , is 10.1 @xmath4 kev  b. this value is @xmath72 4.5 times larger than the value adopted in ssm , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , of 2.3 @xmath4 kev  b. it is therefore important to point out the differences between the present and the previous study of ref .",
    "@xcite : ( i ) all p - wave contributions are included ; ( ii ) the chh method has been used to describe the initial and final state wave functions , corresponding to the latest generation of realistic interactions . the chh method is known to be more accurate than the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it better describes the small components of the wave function to which the one - body axial current operator is most sensitive .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath73 relativistic corrections in the one - body axial current operator are included . in @xmath31s@xmath45 capture , for example",
    ", these terms increase by 25 % the @xmath74 and @xmath75 matrix elements calculated with the one - body axial current operator .",
    "finally , the implications of this new estimate for the sk solar neutrino data have been investigated .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , from which it can be concluded that the enhancement of the @xmath0-factor reported here , although large , is not enough to completely resolve the discrepancies between the present sk results and the ssm predictions .",
    "however , this accurate calculation of the @xmath0-factor , and the consequent absolute prediction for the @xmath3 neutrino flux , will allow much greater discrimination among the proposed solutions to this problem , based on different solar neutrino oscillation scenarios .",
