    "in fact , our experiments with @xmath286 primes @xmath287 show that scaling by @xmath288 is more natural and the ratio @xmath289 stabilises in a reasonably narrow strip between roughly @xmath290 and @xmath291 , see figure  [ fig : maxg ] .",
    "we also notice that for all primes checked the value of @xmath284 is always achieved for @xmath293 with @xmath294 ( that is , for curves with cyclic group of points ) .",
    "moreover , for some primes the same value is also achieved for some pairs @xmath293 with @xmath78 . in our experiments",
    "the value of @xmath284 has never been achieved with @xmath295 .        for primes @xmath297 , where we have computed @xmath298",
    "this ration has achieved @xmath80 for @xmath299 , where @xmath284 and @xmath300 are achieved with the same value of @xmath25 with @xmath301 .",
    "also , only four times ( for @xmath302 ) the value of @xmath298 has been below @xmath303 .",
    "unfortunately these extreme values of both types are invisible on figure  [ fig : gi ] .",
    "we do not know whether these primes are just some sporadic exceptions or whether there are infinitely many such primes .",
    "more generally , it is certainly interesting to evaluate or at least obtain nontrivial theoretic estimates on @xmath304 this may also help to explain the presence of several horizontal lines on figure  [ fig : gi ] ( slightly emphasised there to improve their visibility ) .",
    "clearly , one expects that the value of @xmath284 is achieved for @xmath293 for which @xmath305 , where @xmath306 , is small , so that @xmath307 has a large absolute value which leads to a large value of @xmath277 .",
    "however this is offset by the fact that for @xmath128 having many divisors so the value of @xmath277 is `` split '' between @xmath308 values of @xmath309 .",
    "this effect is observed in the numerical results which are presented below , which show that if @xmath310 then @xmath311 is small but not necessary very small . in particular ,",
    "most of the time @xmath284 and @xmath300 are achieved on different values of @xmath25 , namely in about @xmath312 of the cases within the above range of primes @xmath1 ( more precisely for @xmath313 primes out of the total number of @xmath286 primes @xmath287 ) .",
    "furthermore , it seems that the remaining @xmath314 cases in which @xmath284 and @xmath300 are achieved on the same value of @xmath25 , are the ones that mainly ( but not entirely ) responsible for the presence of horizontal lines on figure  [ fig : gi ] .",
    "indeed , the same lines are clearly visible on figure  [ fig : gi - t ] where the ratios @xmath298 are plotted only if they come from the same value of @xmath25 .",
    "as we have mentioned , we do not have any solid theoretic explanation to the observed facts .",
    "there is certainly more to investigate here , numerically and theoretically , in order to understand the behaviour of @xmath309 ."
