    "recently , we have investigated cosmological applications and confronted them against astrophysical data the following class of gravitational lagrangians :    @xmath0 within the first - order palatini formalism @xcite . here",

    "the numerical parameters @xmath3 are to be determined by astrophysical data .    applying ( palatini ) variational principle compiled with flat flrw metric",

    "particularly , the dynamics of @xmath6cdm model is described by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a density parameter for the dust matter .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite the equation ( [ ab11 ] ) leads to two classes of cosmological models implemented by different solutions of generalized einstein equations .      solving equations of motion by @xmath17 one obtains generalized friedmann equation under the form @xmath18 ^ 2}\\times\\\\ \\times\\left[2\\omega_{0,m}(1+z)^3+\\omega_{0,\\alpha}\\omega_{0,m}(1+z)^6-\\frac{2 - 3\\delta}{\\delta}\\omega_{0,\\beta}\\omega_{0,m}(1+z)^{3(\\delta+1)}\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are dimensionless ( density like ) parameters .",
