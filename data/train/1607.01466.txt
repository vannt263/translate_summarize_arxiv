    "we introduce the intrinsic hyperboloid approach in the dynamic , lorentzian spacetime .",
    "this approach is developed in @xcite to prove , under the maximal foliation gauge , the global stability of minkowski space for einstein equations with massive scalar fields , which reads as @xmath1 with the stress - energy tensor     we fix the convention that , in the einstein summation convention , a greek letter is used for index taking values @xmath2 and a little latin letter is used for index taking values @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the ricci curvature tensor and the scalar curvature of the lorenzian metric @xmath7 respectively . applying the conservation law @xmath8 , which is due to the bianchi identity ,",
    "gives the einstein klein - gordon system @xmath9 it is obvious that @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being minkowski , trivially solves the system .",
    "to construct nontrivial global solutions of ( [ ricci])-([gkg ] ) , it is natural to consider the cauchy problems with the initial data set being small perturbations of the trivial one",
    ".    we first briefly review the framework for studying the cauchy problem of the einstein equations .",
    "let @xmath12 be globally hyperbolic which means that there is a cauchy hypersurface , which is a spacelike hypersurface with the property that any causal curve intersects it at precisely one point .",
    "this allows @xmath13 to be foliated by the level surfaces @xmath14 of a time function @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the future directed unit normal to @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the second fundamental form of @xmath14 in @xmath13 defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the covariant differentiation of @xmath20 in @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the induced metric of @xmath7 on @xmath14 .",
    "we decompose @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lapse function and @xmath24 is the shift vector field .",
    "assuming @xmath25 , then the metric @xmath7 can be written as @xmath26 and the einstein equations are equivalent to the evolution equations @xmath27 together with the constraint equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean curvature of @xmath14 in @xmath30 , @xmath31 denotes the covariant differentiation of @xmath21 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the ricci curvature and the scalar curvature of @xmath21 on @xmath14 .",
    "the maximal foliation gauge imposes @xmath34 this implies @xmath23 satisfies the elliptic equation @xmath35 and the second fundamental form @xmath17 satisfies the codazzi equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnetic part of the weyl curvature , defined in ( [ 7.23.8 ] ) .    the first proof of the global stability of minkowski spacetime for generic , asymptotically flat data is provided in the monumental work @xcite , where the einstein vacuum bianchi equation is thoroughly and systematically treated .",
    "heuristically , we regard the nonlinear wave equation verifying the standard null condition as the vastly simplified model for the einsteinian bianchi equation .",
    "then ( [ ricci])-([gkg ] ) is a coupled system between such nonlinear wave equations and the klein - gordon equation in the einsteinian background . due to the presence of the massive scalar field ,",
    "the approach we introduce in this paper is to twist the hyperboloidal energy method devised in the flat spacetime in @xcite for the klein - gordon equations to the lorentzian spacetime , in the sense of incorporating it to the intrinsic energy scheme devised in @xcite .",
    "such generalization triggers fundamental changes to the geometry of the intrinsic framework in @xcite for the einstein equations , which by itself is very challenging even merely for the vacuum case .",
    "our approach is robust for treating both the scalar field and the einstein part of the equation system .",
    "this will be fully confirmed in @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will use the linear klein - gordon equation to motivate the use of the intrinsic hyperboloids . to begin with ,",
    "let us recall some basics of the invariant vector fields for the free wave @xmath38 .",
    "we assume the initial data for @xmath39 have compact support .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 a set of vector fields , which consists of the translation @xmath41 the scaling vector field @xmath42 and the generator of lorentz group @xmath43 this set of vector fields is named as commuting vector fields due to the fundamental property @xmath44=0 \\mbox { or } 2\\box_\\bm\\ ] ] with the second identity occurring only when @xmath45 .    in order to get the decay estimate @xmath46 by the energy approach , we rely on two ingredients : one is the boundedness of the energy or the generalized energy ; the other is the klainerman - sobolev inequality .",
    "the standard klainerman - sobolev inequality @xmath47 relies on the full set of @xmath40 derivatives , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denotes the application of the differential operators in @xmath40 to @xmath51 up to @xmath52 times . for the free wave equation @xmath38 , by using @xmath53 as a multiplier , one can obtain the conserved energy @xmath54 by using the canonical morawetz vector field , @xmath55 as a multiplier , one can obtain the conserved generalized energy , which is uniformly comparable for @xmath56 to @xmath57 in view of ( [ 3.30.3.16 ] ) , one can see that ( [ 6.4.2.16 ] ) and ( [ 3.30.4.16 ] ) hold with @xmath39 replaced by    for a differential operator @xmath58 , we use @xmath59 to mean the @xmath52-time application of @xmath58 to @xmath51 .",
    "these estimates together with ( [ 3.30.5.16 ] ) imply that @xmath61 which gives more information for @xmath39 than desired .",
    "to see the difference in the treatment for the klein - gordon equation , we consider the linear klein - gordon equation @xmath62 in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "due to ( [ 3.30.3.16 ] ) there holds @xmath63=2 \\box_{\\bm } \\neq 2 ( \\box_{\\bm}-1)$ ] .",
    "thus the scaling vector field @xmath64 can not be used as a commuting vector field for ( [ 3.30.2.16 ] ) .",
    "similar to ( [ 6.4.2.16 ] ) , we can obtain the conserved energy @xmath65 which stays conserved if @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath60 except @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the free wave , the boundedness of energy does not hold for the full set of the commuting vector fields in @xmath40 . the klainerman - sobolev inequality ( [ 3.30.5.16 ] ) can not be used directly . to get the decay estimates for the klein - gordon equations , in @xcite the klainerman - sobolev inequality is applied on the canonical hyperboloids @xmath66 which are the surfaces orthogonal to @xmath64 .",
    "the klainerman - sobolev inequality on hyperboloids merely relies on the lorentz boosts @xmath67 which are commuting vector fields of ( [ 3.30.2.16 ] ) and tangent to the hyperboloids . by virtue of this tool , the standard sharp decay estimate    the area element of @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70    can be derived from the boundedness of energies on hyperboloids .",
    "thus , in order to get the sharp decay for the solutions of ( [ 3.30.2.16 ] ) , the same order of commuting vector fields are applied and energies have to be controlled up to one order higher compared with the free wave case .",
    "this coincides with the case when we treat klein - gordon equation ( [ gkg ] ) coupled with the einstein bianchi equations , for which ( [ 3.30.2.16 ] ) and the free wave are the simplest toy models for each part .",
    "we also observe that the two weighted multipliers , @xmath64 and @xmath71 , can not be used to obtain bounded generalized energy for ( [ 3.30.2.16 ] ) .",
    "this fact together with the fact that the scaling @xmath64 is not a commuting vector field for ( [ 3.30.2.16 ] ) , demonstrates that decomposing @xmath72 in terms of the null frame @xmath73 does not improve the decay along the good direction @xmath74 .",
    "this is another difference compared with the free wave .",
    "contributed by the commuting vector fields @xmath33 , @xmath72 exhibits much stronger decay along the tangential directions of @xmath75 ; however , @xmath72 has the weakest decay along @xmath76 , the future directed unit normal of @xmath77 .",
    "the weakest decay is much weaker than that a free wave exhibits along its only bad direction @xmath78 .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) depicts the method in @xcite , where the data with compact support in @xmath79 are given at @xmath80 .",
    "the energy argument is divided into two steps .",
    "the first step is the local energy propagation from @xmath80 to the initial hyperboloidal slice @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .",
    "the second step is to propagate energy on hyperboloids @xmath77 from @xmath81 to the last slice @xmath83 , in the region enclosed by a minkowskian light cone as the boundary , along which the solution varnishes due to finite speed of propagation .",
    "this figure gives us the blue - print of treating the einstein - klein - gordon system .",
    "-0.5 cm    in order to set up the cauchy problem for the einstein - klein - gordon system ( [ ricci])-([gkg ] ) appropriately , to match with , in particular , the scenario that the data for klein - gordon equation have compact support , we consider the initial data set @xmath84)$ ] for ( [ ricci])-([gkg ] ) , which verify the einstein constraint equations ( [ intr.2 ] ) and @xmath85 $ ] is compactly supported within @xmath86 , the unit euclidian ball . outside of the co - centered euclidean ball of radius @xmath87 ,",
    "there glues a surrounding schwarzschild metric specified at theorem [ 2.15.1 ] .",
    "see figure [ fig1](b ) .",
    "we will call the region with @xmath88 , exterior to the schwarzschild outgoing light cone @xmath89 as the schwarzschild zone @xmath90 , where @xmath89 initiates from the euclidean sphere @xmath91 with the value of @xmath92 specified in section [ 8.07.1 ] .",
    "we still need to determine the foliation of hyperboloids in the curved spacetime .",
    "there are two options at this point . one way is based entirely on the symmetry and geometry in minkowski space .",
    "this method has been developed in @xcite and @xcite for the einstein equations under the wave coordinates .",
    "the philosophy of the regime is to close the energy argument without aiming at achieving sharp decay for geometric quantities .",
    "this allows the stability result to be achieved within a much smaller framework compared with @xcite .",
    "however it is less precise on the asymptotic behavior of the solution ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 47 ) ) .    in this paper and @xcite , we take the other option which constructs intrinsic hyperboloids adapted to the curved spacetimes .",
    "we not only prove the global nonlinear stability , but also give a comprehensive , analytic , global - in - time depiction of the solution .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce the geometric framework , which equips the nonlinear analysis with sets of tetrads , recovering the symmetry and playing the role of coordinates , all of which are adapted to the dynamical spacetime .",
    "the global existence of such tetrads will be justified simultaneously with the quantitative depiction of the spacetime .",
    "when setting up the geometric framework , it is necessary to discriminate , among all the symmetry in the minkowski space , the most crucial geometric information that needs precision from those allowing error to be controlled analytically . for this purpose ,",
    "we run a simple energy argument for @xmath93 by taking the approach as in @xcite , that is to consider @xmath94\\phi.\\ ] ] the error integral contributed by one term contained in the commutator on the right hand side of ( [ 3.30.9.16 ] ) takes the form @xmath95 where the deformation tensor is defined by @xmath96 with @xmath97 denoting the connection induced by the metric @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath98 is the lorentz boost in minkowski space , @xmath99 since @xmath7 is not the minkowski metric . with @xmath100 in @xmath101 , the derivative of @xmath39 contracted with this term",
    "is evaluated at the bad direction @xmath102 along which it does not decay strongly . under local",
    "coordinates the expression of @xmath103 contains @xmath102 derivatives of the metric @xmath7 , paired with large weights .",
    "the best decay for @xmath103 expected by the approach from @xcite is below the borderline @xmath104 for applying gronwall inequality to control energies . to salvage the energy argument",
    ", we construct a set of approximate lorentz boosts @xmath105 and the intrinsic hyperboloids @xmath106 , adapted to the einstein background , so that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 denotes the unit normal of the constructed foliation of hyperboloids .",
    "these @xmath105 and @xmath108 can be viewed as the corresponding replacements of @xmath33 and @xmath102 in the curved spacetime .",
    "the construction of these @xmath105 and @xmath108 needs to preserve the following features :    1 .",
    "@xmath109=0 $ ] and @xmath110 are tangent to @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath111 exhausts the chronological future of an origin @xmath112 , with the origin to be appropriately chosen .",
    "all the hyperboloids are asymptotic to the outgoing light cone @xmath113 emanating from @xmath112 .",
    "the origin @xmath112 is chosen at @xmath114 , which can be done due to the local extension of the solution .",
    "we may choose @xmath115 so that @xmath113 intersects @xmath116 outside of @xmath117 .",
    "the freedom of such choice is fixed in section 2 , which is crucial for the proof of the main results of this paper .",
    "we leave the details of the constructions to section 2 - 3 .",
    "see proposition [ 2.20.18.16 ] for using the first feature to prove @xmath118 and more results on @xmath119 .",
    "the geometric constructions equip us with the approximate lorentz boost , scaling , and translation vector fields . with them",
    "we can run the commuting vector field approach to the einstein bianchi equations , which can be viewed as an extension of the approach in @xcite , where the regime is based on the construction of the rotation vector fields and the intrinsic null cones .",
    "the task , in our situation , is much more involved , due to the difficulties caused by the massive scalar field , the geometry of the hyperboloids , as well as the complexity of the analytic control on the lorentz boosts . in what follows",
    "we focus on addressing the following two basic issues .    1 .",
    "for the weyl part of curvature , we will run the regime of bel - robinson energies defined by the weighted multipliers @xmath64 and @xmath71 .",
    "for closing the top order energy , we encounter the issue of requiring higher order @xmath105-energy for the massive scalar field .",
    "however , in order to close the energy estimates , we have to control the energies of the weyl tensors and the massive scalar field , up to the same order in terms of the @xmath105-derivatives .",
    "the intrinsic hyperboloids , in principle , are defined from the minkowskian counterparts by a global diffeomorphism , which needs to be justified simultaneously with the proof of the global existence of the solution . in minkowski space ,",
    "the density of the foliation of the canonical hyperboloids approaches infinity near the causal boundary .",
    "the control on the intrinsic foliation is considerably more delicate since , analytically , terms of @xmath120 type appear frequently , with @xmath121 when approaching the causal boundary @xmath113 .    to solve the first issue , it is crucial to use the einstein bianchi equations , see lemma [ 7.23.12 ] , which allows us to perform the integration by parts when treating the worst type of terms .",
    "we then take advantage of the null forms in the einstein bianchi equations , together with the expected strong decay from the scalar field .",
    "this enables the top order energies to be closed at a sharp level .",
    "we will sketch briefly the energy scheme in section 4 .",
    "the second issue is connected to the set - up of the wave zone , the region where we run the energy estimates .",
    "we have to take account of the gravitational influence to the causal structure of the foliation of the intrinsic hyperboloids . in this paper , we focus on controlling the intrinsic geometry of the chronological future @xmath122 for @xmath123 and for all @xmath15 in the schwarzschild zone .",
    "this geometric control is significant for dealing with the problem of leakage , for demonstrating that a constructed function is almost optical , and for justifying an excision procedure on the wave zone for the energy scheme .",
    "these aspects will be explained in the sequel .    in the minkowskian set - up ( figure [ fig1](a ) ) , a light cone",
    "is used to cut the family of hyperboloids , as the boundary of the wave zone .",
    "the cone needs to be uniformly away from the asymptote .",
    "the set - up of such boundary in the curved spacetime is more subtle .",
    "first of all , this boundary should be chosen in the schwarzschild region , to guarantee the dynamical part of the solution is contained in its interior .",
    "it ought to be a canonical schwarzschild light cone @xmath124    the value of @xmath125 can be found in section [ 8.07.1 ] .    for the ease of analysing energy flux therein .",
    "more importantly , we need a function measuring the  distance \" from any point in the entire wave zone to @xmath113 , which is the asymptote of the hyperboloids . this nonnegative function needs to be bounded uniformly away from zero in the wave zone , for the purpose of running the energy estimates .",
    "this task intuitively could be achieved if @xmath124 is spaced away uniformly from @xmath113 in terms of a canonical optical function in @xmath90 .    in lorentzian spacetime",
    "the light cones are usually characterized by the level sets of an optical function @xmath126 ( see @xcite ) which is defined as the solution of the eikonal equation @xmath127 with prescribed boundary or initial conditions .",
    "then the optical function @xmath126 naturally measures the distance to the causal boundary . to obtain",
    "the information of @xmath126 would require geometric controls on the foliations of light cones @xmath128 .",
    "however , since such light cones are not involved in our analysis , we do not use the actual optical function . in our framework",
    ", @xmath106 conceptually replaces the role usually played by @xmath128 .",
    "the geometric control on the hyperboloids @xmath106 lies at the core of our analysis . to achieve the desired analytic feature , we choose @xmath129 to be the proper time to @xmath112 , where @xmath129 verifies the eikonal equation @xmath130 throughout the chronological future @xmath131 , we define an alterative function , still denoted by @xmath126 , which does not verify ( [ 5.8.1.16 ] ) , yet taking the role of measuring the distance to @xmath113 .",
    "in particular , we can show that this function @xmath126 , vanishing on @xmath113 , is sufficiently close to the canonical optical function near @xmath113 in @xmath90 . to show such property ,",
    "we perform in section [ almost ] a full analytic comparison between the radial normal of the schwarzschild frame and the normal vector field on @xmath14 , induced by the foliation of the intrinsic hyperboloid @xmath132 .",
    "the main estimates are established in theorem [ 4.10.6 ] throughout @xmath133 , which is the major building block of this paper .",
    "these estimates and their higher order counterparts will be used in the main energy scheme in @xcite .",
    "next we address the issue of the leakage .",
    "let @xmath134 be a point inside the wave zone , near the boundary @xmath124 .",
    "the distance maximizing timelike geodesic connecting @xmath134 and @xmath112 is not entirely contained in the wave zone .",
    "see figure [ fig1](b ) . this phenomenon can be easily seen in minkowski space . in minkowskian case",
    "the deformation tensors of the boosts vanish and the deformation tensor of the scaling vector field has a standard value . however , in the dynamical spacetime , deformation tensors @xmath119 and @xmath135 need to be analyzed , which is done by integrating along the aforementioned time - like geodesics with the help of the structure equations which contain both the curvature components under the hyperboloidal frame and the second fundamental forms ; see section [ 5.10.1.16 ] .",
    "whether the path of the integration is contained in the wave zone determines how to control the integrand .",
    "the geometric information outside of the wave zone can not be provided by the energy estimates .",
    "such information is obtained simultaneously with the main estimates in section 5 by geometric comparisons and bootstrap arguments .",
    "now we explain , as part of the energy scheme , the excision of a region which is related to the so - called last slice of hyperboloids , denoted by @xmath136 . as a standard method for proving global results of non - linear dynamical problem",
    ", one can suppose a set of bootstrap assumptions hold till certain maximal life - span .",
    "due to various concerns , we set the maximal life - span in terms of the proper time , labeled by @xmath137 .",
    "once the bootstrap assumptions can be improved for all @xmath138 , by the principle of continuation , the solution and the quantitative control can be extended beyond @xmath137 .",
    "the wave zone is a region which is enclosed by the initial slice @xmath116 , the last slice @xmath136 as well as the cone @xmath124 .",
    "consider the energy estimates on @xmath14 , which are crucial for controlling @xmath139 .",
    "when @xmath140 where @xmath141 , we no longer expect a regular subset of @xmath14 within the wave zone to do the energy estimates ( see figure [ fig4 ] in section [ engsch ] ) .",
    "the subset of wave zone with @xmath140 will be excised for obtaining the @xmath14-energy .",
    "this may lead to the loss of control of @xmath139 in a region with @xmath15 large within the wave zone , which would fail the energy control on @xmath106 .",
    "our strategy is to show that the region of excision is fully contained in @xmath90 , where @xmath139 and other geometric quantities can be controlled by the main estimates .",
    "this proof has to be done merely depending on local energy estimate , and the assumption that the foliation of @xmath106 exists up to @xmath138 , which is the case in this paper ( see section 6 ) .    as the other application of the main estimates ,",
    "we show that the hawking mass is convergent to the adm mass of the surrounding schwarzschild metric along every hyperboloid .    finally",
    ", we comment on the analysis of the intrinsic geometry in @xmath90 .",
    "this analysis is independent of the long - time energy estimates in the wave zone .",
    "the idea is to use the transport equations to perform the long - time geometric comparison .",
    "we define a set of quantities which encode the deviation between the intrinsic and the extrinsic tetrads , and derive the transport equations for them along well - chosen paths . in order to prove the function",
    "@xmath126 is almost optical , we uncover a series of cancelations , contributed by the schwarzschild metric and the structure equations of the hyerboloidal foliation .",
    "it necessitates delicate bootstrap arguments and weighted estimates     the primitive version of such weighted estimates can be seen in @xcite .    .",
    "the obtained main estimates are crucial for the applications in section 6 - 7 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections 2 - 3 we carefully set up the analytic framework of the foliation of intrinsic hyperboloids , and",
    "provide the geometric construction of the intrinsic frame of the lorentz boosts , since such set - up and construction have never appeared in the literature . in section [ engsch ]",
    "we sketch the energy scheme in the proof of global stability of minkowski space for ( [ ricci])-([gkg ] ) . in section [ almost ] , by assuming the foliation of the intrinsic hyperboloids and the maximal foliation exist till the last slice of hyperboloid , we provide a thorough depiction of the intrinsic geometry in the schwarzschild zone , presented in theorem [ 4.10.6 ] , as the main estimates of this paper .",
    "the region considered there is the most sensitive region for having the geometric control on hyperboloids .",
    "the set of main estimates depends merely on local - in - time energy estimates and the smallness of the given data on the initial maximal slice .",
    "we then give applications of the main estimates .",
    "the one in section [ wza ] is to control the region of the excision . in section [ mass ] , we give the asymptotic behavior of the hawking mass along all hyperboloids .",
    "by standard energy and iteration argument , we first solve the cauchy problem of ekg back to the past to certain fixed @xmath142 .",
    "let @xmath143 be the spacial origin of the given initial slice .",
    "we denote by @xmath144 the geodesic through @xmath143 with velocity @xmath145 , where @xmath16 is the future - directed time - like unit normal of the initial slice @xmath146 .",

    "@xmath115 is chosen so that the given cauchy data at the initial slice is fully contained in @xmath148 , where @xmath149 denotes the causal future of @xmath112 .",

    "@xmath115 is chosen such that @xmath113 intersects at @xmath80 outside of @xmath117 .",
    "now by the shift of @xmath151 , as well as an abuse of notation , @xmath80 at @xmath112 and the initial data is prescribed at @xmath152 , according to the time coordinate after the shift .",
    "we use @xmath122 to denote the chronological future of @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath153 be the time - like radius of injectivity of @xmath112 , which is defined to be the supremum over all the values @xmath154 for which the exponential map @xmath155 is a global diffeomorphism from @xmath156 to its image in @xmath122 , where @xmath157 is the canonical hyperboloid in @xmath158 and @xmath159 is the time - like geodesic with @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
