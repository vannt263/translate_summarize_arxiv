    "dwarf galaxies are probably the most common type of galaxies in the universe . at the low end of the mass and luminosity distributions , they span a very wide range of properties and morphologies .",
    "dwarf galaxies can be divided into two large groups : dwarf irregulars ( dirs ) and dwarf ellipticals ( des ) ( we include in this group the so - called dwarf spheroidal galaxies ) . in the simplest scheme ,",
    "the key differences between the two groups are that dirs have large amounts of gas and high current star formation activity producing many hii regions and blue stars , while des lack gas and contain only old ( @xmath9 gyr ) stars .",
    "morphologically , dirs tend to be patchy small blue galaxies like ngc 6822 or ic 1613 , while des show a smooth luminosity distribution ( e.g.  ngc 147 ) and in many cases are hardly distinguishable from the sky background , like sextans or the small andromeda companions .",
    "however , this picture has been shown to be too simple and the separation between both groups is quite diffuse , if any .",
    "on the one hand , there are objects with large amounts of gas but showing an apparently low star formation rate ( sfr ) , such as pegasus ( aparicio , gallart , & bertelli 1997a ) or lgs 3 ( aparicio , gallart , & bertelli 1997b ) .",
    "these systems have few or no hii regions and lack the patchy morphology of more active dirs .",
    "but , since these galaxies are equally gas rich , the different appearances among dirs may be the result of episodic star formation , in such a way that some of them are in an active phase of star formation while others are currently quiescent .",
    "on the other hand , growing evidence exists that objects traditionally considered to be des have a substantial intermediate age stellar population .",
    "this was first shown by the discovery of carbon stars in most of the de satellites of the milky way ( see azzopardi 1994 and references therein ) and then beautifully shown in the deep color - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams obtained for some of these galaxies , like carina ( smeker - hane , stetson , & hesser 1994 ) , leo i ( lee et al .",
    "1993a ) , fornax ( stetson 1997 ) and phoenix ( martnez - delgado , aparicio , & gallart 1998 ) .",
    "there is also some evidence of an intermediate age population in the larger de andromeda companions , particularly in the cases of ngc  185 ( martnez - delgado , aparicio , & gallart 1997 ) and ngc  205 ( davidge 1992 ) .",
    "therefore it is not clear where the true dividing line between dirs and des ( if any ) should be placed ; even the gas content , which should tell us about a galaxy s potential to form stars is not a clear indicator , since galaxies which are apparently devoid of gas , such as fornax ( stetson 1997 ) , somehow manage to keep forming stars .",
    "all this calls to a revision of our current understanding of the nature of dwarf galaxies .",
    "in order to further explore the differences among the dwarf galaxy population , we have undertaken a study of the newly rediscovered antlia dwarf galay .",
    "the galaxy had been noted by crowin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) ; feitzinger & galinsky ( 1985 ) and arp & madore ( 1987 ) , but was overlooked for a decade",
    ". whiting , irwin & haw ( 1997 ) rediscovered the galaxy from inspection of the uk schmidt telescope plates covering the entire southern sky .",
    "deep ccd images on the 1.5 m telescope at cerro tololo observatory performed by these authors revealed it completely resolved into individual stars , indicating that it was probably a new local group member . from wide band and h@xmath10 images",
    ", these authors observed no hot blue stars nor any obvious trace of star forming regions .",
    "they concluded that the galaxy is a typical de similar to the milky way satellites and to the tucana dwarf .",
    "they estimate the distance to be about 1.15 mpc and its diameter 12 kpc .",
    "we have performed deep @xmath0 photometry of the galaxy resolving a large number of stars .",
    "in contrast to whiting et al . ( 1997 ) , our results show that star formation is currently taking place ( or stopped just a few myr ago ) in the central part of antlia , making it similar to the smallest , faintest dir galaxies like pegasus , lgs 3 or phoenix .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ obs ] briefly presents the observations . in",
    "[ cmmain ] an overview of the cm diagram is given and used to estimate the distance to antlia and its metallicity . in ",
    "[ light ] the integrated light distribution is discussed . the star formation history ( sfh )",
    "is sketched in  [ sfh ] , through comparison to other well studied faint dirs .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in  [ conclusiones ] .",
    "observations of the antlia dwarf were made at las campanas observatories on the nights of april 10 - 12 and april 14 , 1997 under photometric conditions , using the dupont 2.5 m telescope with a 2048@xmath112048 thinned tektronics chip with 0.259pixels , a gain of 2.2 e@xmath12/adu , and a read noise of 6.6 e@xmath12 .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table 1 .",
    "all images were bias subtracted using the overscan region , and corrected for residual 2-dimensional structure using a bias frame .",
    "dome flats were used to remove pixel - to - pixel and large scale variations in the chip response .",
    "a fringe frame was created from a median all of the images taken on the night of april 14th of high latitude nearly - blank fields and was subtracted from all @xmath13 band images , after matching the sky levels .",
    "the sky in the resulting frames is flat to within 0.7% .",
    "photometry of the stars in antlia has been performed using the new daophot / allstar / allframe software , made available to us by dr .",
    "stetson ( see stetson 1994 ) .",
    "a master frame has been produced using the best seeing images , both @xmath14 and @xmath13 , obtained throughout the run . the total integration times are 2400 sec in @xmath14 and 2400 sec in @xmath13 and the fwhm of the stellar images is 0.8  for the combined image .",
    "three find / allstar / substar passes have been used to identify stars in this master frame . the resulting list , consisting on 6831 stars ,",
    "has been given to allframe to perform the photometry in the 16 individual frames using quadratically varying psfs computed for each individual frame .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath13 magnitudes for the stars have been obtained as the robust average of the magnitudes obtained in the individual frames .",
    "only stars that have been measured in at least three images have been considered .",
    "the resulting @xmath14 and @xmath13 photometry lists have been paired using daomaster .",
    "a final list of 5566 stars is the result of this process .",
    "this catalogue of stars has been filtered using the error parameters given by allframe , retaining only stars with acceptable chi and sharp parameters and @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "aperture corrections have been obtained using a large number of well measured stars in one @xmath14 and one @xmath13 image of antlia .",
    "they are accurate to @xmath17 mag in @xmath14 and @xmath18 mag in @xmath13 .",
    "extinction for each night and the final transformation to the johnson - cousins standard system has been computed using several standards in the list of landolt ( 1992 ) observed repeatedly throughout each of the nights .",
    "color terms have been found to be comparable to the dispersion of the data and have not been used .",
    "the standard errors of the extinctions are always smaller than 0.01 , while the standard errors in the zero points are @xmath17 magnitudes in @xmath14 and @xmath19 magnitudes in @xmath13 . the total errors in the zeropoint of the photometry are therefore about 0.01 in both @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath13 image of antlia . for the analysis of the stellar content ( see  [ cmmain ] and  [ sfh ] ) , the observed field has been divided into several parts .",
    "region a corresponds to the central part of antlia ; region b covers the optical external part of the galaxy and regions c map the foreground field stars . a finding chart of the resolved stars with well measured photometry is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( see  [ foreground ] ) .",
    "the central part is displayed in fig .",
    "3 , which shows the beautiful resolution into stars of the central part of antlia . the circle indicates a possible hii region in the center of this region , which corresponds to a large concentration of blue stars . that this central object is actually an hii region needs to be confirmed with deep @xmath20 observations",
    "the cm diagrams of regions a , b and c ( see fig . 1 ) are shown in fig .",
    "panels [ a ] and [ b ] show the cm diagrams of the inner ( a ) and outer ( b ) galaxy .",
    "panels [ c ] and [ d ] are cm diagrams of the external ( c ) regions .",
    "they show only a randomly chosen fraction of the stars in these regions such that sampled areas are the same as those of regions a and b , respectively ; no attempt has been made to correct for the difference in crowding between the galaxy and field regions .",
    "these diagrams have been used to remove foreground stars from diagrams [ a ] and [ b ] . to do so , for each star in the foreground frames ( [ c ] & [ d ] ) , we select all the stars of the corresponding galaxy frame which lie within a range of magnitude and color around the selected foreground star . this range is the allframe error corresponding to the magnitude of the foreground star . in a second step , one of the selected stars is randomly chosen and removed . if no stars happen to be inside the error interval , then the nearest one within 0.5 magnitudes is removed .",
    "the resulting clean diagrams are plotted in panels [ e ] and [ f ] .",
    "field subtraction in the central region ( a ) is quite independent on the particular subsample of field stars used , due to the low percentage of foreground stars .",
    "this is not the case for the low surface brightness outer region ( b ) , and particularly affects the blue stars and those above the trgb .",
    "thus , it can not be ruled out that the few stars that remain in these regions in the outer galaxy result from bad field subtraction .",
    "foreground stars as well as those removed from regions a and b are plotted with small dots in fig .",
    "the open circles mark the stars that have been left in the cm diagrams as galaxy members after the field subtraction , and the filled triangles mark blue stars from panels [ e ] and [ f ] in fig .",
    "the antlia @xmath21 $ ] cm diagram shows characteristics typical of the cm diagrams of other dir galaxies , with evidence for both an old and a young population . the old and intermediate age population clump together in what we are calling the _ red - tangle _ ( see aparicio , & gallart 1994 ) , which corresponds to the rgb and agb locii .",
    "the red tangle is the most prominent feature of the antlia cm diagram , running from @xmath21\\simeq [ 1.0,24.0]$ ] to @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "there is also a considerable population of blue stars ( @xmath23 ) in the cm diagram of the central region ( panel [ e ] of fig .",
    "it is remarkable that these blue stars are entirely absent from the cm diagram of the outer part of the galaxy ( panel [ f ] ) .",
    "the presence of these stars in the central region , as well as the candidate hii region ( fig .",
    "3 ) , support the idea that antlia is a dir galaxy rather than a de ( see  [ sfh ] ) .",
    "most of the bright stars ( @xmath24 ) are likely foreground stars .",
    "the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "4 have not been corrected for interstellar extinction .",
    "however , the extinction must be considered in the forthcoming calculation of metallicity and distance .",
    "the galactic coordinates of antlia are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which lies in a region of moderate gradient and between the isolines corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the extinction maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) . neglecting internal reddening",
    ", we assume @xmath29 . using the extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) with @xmath30 ,",
    "the extinctions in @xmath14 and @xmath13 are @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ".      the average stellar metallicity can be obtained from @xmath33 , which is the color index of the rgb half a magnitude below the trgb ( see da costa & armandroff 1990 ; lee , freedman , & madore 1993b ) . we have estimated @xmath34 from the median of the stars with colors in the interval @xmath35 and with magnitudes in the interval @xmath36 ( the magnitude of the trgb is @xmath37 ; see  [ distancia ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath38 , with a color dispersion of @xmath39 .",
    "similar values are obtained using stars in the outer region b : 1.46 and 0.08 , respectively .",
    "the photometric error yielded by allframe at this magnitude is about @xmath40 .",
    "as shown by aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) and gallart , aparicio , & vlchez ( 1996a ) , the actual external errors affecting the photometry can not be in general estimated from this and are quite dependent on other observational effects ( crowding , blending and others ) .",
    "however , the fact that we obtain quite similar values for the color dispersion in central and outer regions indicates that these effects are small and that probably , most of the observational dispersion is due to signal - to - noise at these magnitudes . in these conditions ,",
    "allframe errors may be a reasonable estimate of the actual total errors .",
    "furthermore , considering that at the magnitude we are dealing with , the photometric uncertainty is small compared with the color dispersion we measure , it is reasonable to assume that the latter is a good representation of the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "we will use it below to estimate the dispersion in metallicity .",
    "the resulting dereddened value for the color index of the rgb is @xmath41 .",
    "using the calibration by lee et al .",
    "( 1993b ) , we obtain a metallicity @xmath42=-1.6\\pm 0.1 $ ] , corresponding to @xmath43 and in good agreement with the estimate by whiting et al .",

    "the absolute magnitude of the trgb is slightly dependent on the metallicity , which we have estimated above in  [ metalicidad ] . to obtain the magnitude of the trgb we have used the luminosity function ( lf ) of the stars in the color interval @xmath45 drawn from the central galaxy ( region a ) , after correction for foreground contamination ( diagram [ e ] in fig .",
    "we have computed the lf by counting the stars lying inside an interval of @xmath46 magnitudes about a central value of @xmath13 .",
    "the central value has been varied in steps of 0.02 magnitudes to obtain the lf while reducing the dependence of the results upon the particular choice of bin center .",
    "finally , an edge detecting sobel filter @xmath47 $ ] has been aplied to the lf .",
    "this produces a sharp peak at the trgb corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "the error has been obtained from the width of the peak at 1/3 of its heigh .",
    "the same process applied to the foreground stars alone yields a noisy distribution with a dispersion which is 3.5 times smaller than the height of the peak detected for region a. the resulting dereddened value is @xmath49 .",
    "the error has been calculated from the quadratic addition of the sobel filter and extinction errors .",
    "the color index of the trgb is necessary to calculate the bolometric correction to be used in the @xmath50-distance calibration .",
    "it has been estimated from the median color index of the stars with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we find @xmath53 which when corrected for external extinction yields @xmath54 .    using the calibration by lee et al .",
    "( 1993b ) , we obtain a distance modulus @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath7 mpc .",
    "the intrinsic error of the method is about @xmath56 ( see lee et al .",
    "this is the adopted error since it is larger than the photometric and extiction ones .",
    "although marginally compatible , our distance is slightly larger than the result by whiting et al .",
    "the reason for the disagreement might be an upward shift of the trgb in whiting et al .",
    "cm diagram due to crowding effects at the level of their limiting magnitude .",
    "antlia lies @xmath57 south from ngc 3109 and both galaxies lie at the same distance , inside the error intervals ( see capaccioli , piotto & bresolin 1992 ; lee 1993 ; davidge 1993 ) . assuming the same distance for both galaxies , their minimum physical separation is @xmath58 kpc .",
    "however , if the distance of ngc 3109 is assumed to be @xmath59 mpc ( capaccioli et al .",
    "1992 ; lee 1993 ) , and the errors are considered , the true separation could be as large as 180 kpc . in spite of their close proximity",
    ", the difference in the velocities makes not clear whether antlia is gravitationally bound to ngc 3109 . assuming a mass of @xmath60 for ngc 3109 ( jobin & carignan 1990 ) , and circular orbits , antlia would be unbound if the relative velocity exceeded only @xmath61 .",
    "the radial velocity of ngc 3109 is 406 kms@xmath3 ( hartmann 1994 and 1997 ) , while that of antlia is 361 kms@xmath3 ( fouqu et al .",
    "this means that the galaxies would be unbound if the realtive distance is @xmath62 kpc .",
    "considering that still smaller values will be in general expected for non - circular orbits , it is more likely that either they are both bound to the larger mass of the local group ( although van den bergh 1994 places ngc 3109 just beyond the gravitational limit of the local group ) , or they are members of a common filament feeding into the local group region .",
    "to determine the total magnitude , color , and surface brightness distribution of antlia , we have fit its surface brightness distribution with ellipses of ellipticity @xmath63 and semi - major axis at position angle @xmath64 ( measured from north to east ) , in both the @xmath14 and the @xmath13 bands , after masking out stars which were too bright to be members of the galaxy ( e.g.  @xmath65 ) .",
    "the sky was subtracted using the median surface brightness distribution in the ellipses beyond a radius of @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting @xmath14-band surface brightness distribution is shown in figure 5 as a function of the ellipse semi - major axis @xmath67 . in both the @xmath14 and @xmath13 bands ,",
    "the surface brightness distribution is fairly flat to a radius of @xmath68 , which corresponds roughly to the extent of the central galaxy defined by region ( a ) , and then falls off more steeply at larger radii .",
    "this is comparable to the profiles of the faint andromeda companions and i , and ii , & and iii , reported by caldwell et al .",
    ". the @xmath14 band surface brightness can be well fit by a double exponential profile with central surface brightness @xmath69 and exponential scale length @xmath70 in the inner regions ( @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 at larger radii .",
    "this gives an angular diameter at the @xmath74 isophote of @xmath75 ; this corresponds to an isophote of @xmath76 .",
    "given the distance of the galaxy , the break in the surface brightness profile occurs at @xmath77 kpc , and the inner and outer scale lengths are 0.36 kpc and 0.14 kpc , respectively .",
    "integrating the surface brightness profiles within the @xmath14 and @xmath13 bands out to the @xmath74 isophote , we find @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , uncorrected for internal or galactic extinction .",
    "the quoted errors are an upper limit computed assuming that every point in fig .",

    "( 1991 ) , the internal extinction of antlia can be estimated to be @xmath81 .",
    "using the extinction law by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with @xmath30 this yields @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "after correction for internal and external extinction and considering the error in the distance modulus , the total absolute magnitude of antlia is @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the luminosity of antlia is therefore comparable to the faintest dirs , making antlia an extremely faint galaxy in spite of its recent star formation .",
    "the mean color of antlia is quite blue : @xmath86 , and is comparable to the colors of galaxy types scd & i m ( @xmath87 ) for the coleman et al .",

    "the color magnitude diagrams presented in  [ cmmain ] clearly show that antlia has had an extended star formation history , as evidenced by its old and intermediate age red - tangle and its population of young , blue stars .",
    "we can sketch the sfh of antlia in more detail by comparing antlia with two faint , low surface brightness dirs whose cm diagrams are similar to antlia s and whose star formation histories have been well studied : pegasus ( aparicio et al .",
    "1997a ) and lgs 3 ( aparicio et al .",
    "the sfhs of these galaxies have been determined from their resolved stellar content ( former references ) , hence from information similar to the one available for antlia .",
    "it turns out , as we will see below , that antlia has characteristics intermediate between these two galaxies .",

    "1994 ) of 0.1 gyr and @xmath89 for antlia and lgs 3 and the same age and @xmath90 for pegasus , is overplotted in the four diagrams .",
    "the isochrone qualitatively shows that the blue stars present in the cm diagrams of the central region of antlia are likely young main - sequence ( ms ) and/or blue - loops ( bl ) stars a few hundred myr old , indicating that recent star formation activity has taken place in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "the few stars observed above the trgb ( within @xmath91 magnitude ) in antlia s central cm diagram are likely intermediate - age agb stars , similar to what are observed in pegasus and , to a lesser extent , in lgs 3 .",
    "these stars indicate star formation activity at intermediate ages .",
    "a few of these blue stars and likely intermediate age stars are also seen in the outer regions of antlia , but , as stated above , they may also result from incomplete field subtraction in the more highly contaminated outer regions .",
    "the fact that antlia lacks an extended agb red tail structure like pegasus ( seen redward of @xmath92 , at @xmath93 ) , is consistent with its low metallicity ( aparicio & gallart 1994 ) .",
    "if star formation has been very recent in the central region , hii regions would be expected . however , conspicuous hii regions are not necessarily required if the star formation is going on at a slow rate .",

    "interestingly , a feature is seen in our images of antlia that could be a small hii region .",
    "it is marked with a circle in fig .",
    "3 and its position corresponds to the clump of blue stars at @xmath94 shown in fig .",

    "the stars are counted as blue when they are at least 0.5 magnitudes bluer than that @xmath99 ; otherwise , they are counted as red .",

    ", it seems that the past sfr was much higher than it has been in the most recent 1 gyr .",

    "nevertheless at the distances of the dir galaxies , it is difficult to ascertain whether what we are observing as a `` halo '' consists of a purely `` old '' ( age @xmath9 gyr ) population , or that at the low densities in the outer regions , star formation procedes much more slowly than in the dense center , such that the quantity of young stars at any time is much smaller than in the central region , and hence virtually unobservable . note that the structure of the red - tangle in both the central and the outer region is very similar , suggesting similar sfh from 1 gyr to 15 gyr for both parts of the galaxy . although appealing , we argue that this hypothetical , truly dual , core - halo structure in dir galaxies should be further investigated . the analysis of the stellar population in a large enough area containing both kind of ( core - halo ) population , through comparison with model cm diagrams ( see aparicio et al . 1997a and 1997b and gallart et al .",
    "1997b ) may cast some light to this issue .",
    "we have presented photometry of resolved stars in the recently discovered antlia dwarf galaxy . although it is an intrinsically faint , low surface brightness galaxy , antlia has characteristics of dir galaxies rather than des , at least from the point of view of the relatively large amount of recent star formation detected in its central region .",
    "its hi mass is also compatible with a dir galaxy .",
    "future measures of its hi and hii contents will help towards understanding its properties .",
    "the stellar component of the galaxy has an average metallicity @xmath42=-1.6\\pm 0.1 $ ] , corresponding to @xmath43 , simlar to the less enriched dirs and des .",
    "this places antlia nicely on the relationships @xmath42-m_{\\rm v}$ ] and @xmath42-\\mu_{\\rm v}$ ] shown by caldwell et al .",
    "antlia is at a distance of @xmath7 mpc , at what is considered to be the outskirts of the local group .",
    "it is also a close companion ( @xmath120 ) of ngc 3109 , although their relative velocity ( 45 kms@xmath3 ) makes it unlikely that they form a gravitationally bound pair .",
    "they would be bound only if their relative distance is smaller than 37 kp and the orbit is circular .",
    "antlia has a light distribution which is well described by a double exponential , with a relatively flat distribution within @xmath121 which steepens at larger radii . its central surface brightness is @xmath69 , and its isophotal diameter along the semi - major axis is @xmath75 or @xmath122 , making it an intrinsically small low surface brightness galaxy .",
    "antlia s integrated absolute magnitude within @xmath74 is @xmath84 , making it among the lowest luminosity galaxies known .",
    "it is also quite blue ( @xmath123 ) , and is comparable in color to very late type scd",
    "/ im galaxies .",
    "the antlia sfh has been discussed through comparison with the cm diagrams of pegasus and lgs 3 .",
    "star formation is currently going on ( or has stoped within the last few myr ) in the central @xmath124 kpc of antlia , at a rate at least twice as large as the average for the entire galaxy lifetime ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this rate is similar to and probably intermediate between that of pegasus and lgs 3 .",
    "little or no star formation is currently taking place in the outer region of the galaxy .",
    "this behaviour seems to be quite common in dwarf galaxies and might be indicative of a core - halo structure in which the gas participating in the star formation would be concentrated towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that the question of whether the outer part of the galaxy showing little or no current star formation is or not a _ true _ halo , composed solely by an old ( @xmath9 gyr old ) population should be further investigated .",
    "given the integrated star formation history , we estimate that the total mass into stars and stellar remnants is @xmath6 m@xmath2 .",
