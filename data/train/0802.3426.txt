    "effective field theory ( eft ) provides a controlled framework for exploiting the separation of scales in nuclei .",
    "it is crucial to formulate a power counting that justifies a systematic truncation of the lagrangian leading to observables with the desired accuracy .",
    "nuclei offer a non - trivial challenge because one wants such a perturbative expansion in addition to the non - perturbative treatment of certain leading operators , which is required by the existence of shallow bound states . by now , mainly few - body systems have been studied within eft , and , while much remains to be understood , many successes have been achieved @xcite .",
    "similar to other approaches , the extension of efts to larger nuclei faces computational challenges @xcite . as a first step in this extension",
    ", we specialized to very low energies where clusters of nucleons behave coherently @xcite . even though many interesting issues of nuclear structure are by - passed , we can describe anomalously shallow ( `` halo '' or `` cluster '' ) nuclei and some reactions of astrophysical interest .",
    "since they are strongly bound , alpha particles play a central role in this framework .",
    "many nuclear states have energies close to thresholds for break - up into alpha particles and nucleons , the most famous being the excited ( `` hoyle '' ) state of @xmath2c near the triple - alpha ( @xmath3 ) threshold .",
    "these states should be describable within the halo / cluster eft , which is formulated with contact interactions among nucleon ( @xmath4 ) and alpha - particle ( @xmath5 ) fields . together with the @xmath6 interaction ,",
    "the @xmath0 interaction is an important input for such calculations .",
    "while we have studied the @xmath6 interaction elsewhere through both neutron - alpha ( @xmath7 ) @xcite and proton - alpha ( @xmath8 ) @xcite scattering , we focus here on @xmath0 scattering .",
    "consideration of this system is required before tackling other states with two or more alpha particles , such as @xmath9be and @xmath2c .",
    "the internal alpha - particle dynamics is characterized by an intrinsic momentum scale @xmath10 associated with the binding mechanism .",
    "a naive guess is that this scale is set by the pion mass @xmath11 mev .",
    "the @xmath0 interaction consists of the long - range photon exchange and short - range strong interactions . at low energies ,",
    "the latter can be represented by contact interactions .",
    "the central issue is the relative importance of these contributions .",

    "much below 100 mev , the deviation from pure - coulomb @xmath0 scattering is dominated by the @xmath20 wave @xcite . the large near - threshold @xmath20-wave phase shift has been interpreted as resulting from a ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) = ( @xmath23 , 0 ) state @xcite at an energy @xmath24  mev above threshold in the center - of - mass frame , with a tiny width @xmath25 ev .",
    "the momentum corresponding to this @xmath26be state sets a smaller scale @xmath27 mev , which must arise from the larger underlying scale @xmath10 by a fine - tuning of the parameters of the underlying theory .    in the halo eft ,",

    "power counting is dependent on how the various parameters scale with @xmath29 and @xmath10 .",

    "the leading contribution for momenta @xmath43 comes entirely from the unitarity term @xmath44 in the inverse amplitude . to this order",
    ", the @xmath26be system would be at the so - called unitary limit , exhibiting conformal invariance @xcite , and @xmath45c would acquire an exact efimov spectrum @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss later , this exact pattern is modified by the coulomb interaction , which breaks scale invariance and thus moves the @xmath26be ground state away from threshold .",
    "we will see that in leading order we can describe the ground state , and higher - energy , scattering data can be systematically accounted for in higher orders .",
    "at this point , we simply fit the eft parameters to data . in the future , many - body methods @xcite should allow the calculation of these parameters from the underlying efts , which in turn will have their parameters obtained from lattice qcd @xcite .    to the extent that the halo / cluster eft is built on fields for clusters , it is closely related to phenomenological few - body cluster models @xcite .",
    "the latter have had many applications , ranging from the general analysis of halo structures @xcite to the successful confrontation with data for specific processes , such as decays of @xmath2c resonances @xcite .",

    ", we study the alternative expansion scenario and perform a detailed comparison to phase - shift data for the @xmath0 system .",
    "as we will see , among the many findings our new method entails are a new expansion for the @xmath0 amplitude around the resonance , which differs from the effective - range expansion ; the existence of inconsistencies between recent resonance measurements and old scattering data ; a more precise determination of low - energy parameters ; and an extraordinary amount of fine - tuning .",

    "we start with a summary of some basic ideas in halo eft @xcite , extended to include the main equations needed to deal with coulomb interactions .",

    "[ app : ceft ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pc ] we discuss the significant differences in scales between alpha - cluster systems and the @xmath37 system considered by kong and ravndal  @xcite .",
    "we consider here the scattering of two alpha particles of charge @xmath46 and reduced mass @xmath47 , at a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath48 .",
    "we want to build an eft that provides a controlled expansion for observables at momenta around the @xmath23 resonance , @xmath49  mev  @xmath50 .",
    "the energy of the resonance , @xmath24 mev , is much smaller than either the alpha - particle excitation energy @xmath51  mev or any energy set by pion exchange , such as two - pion exchange between alpha particles or one - pion exchange among nucleons , @xmath52  mev .",
    "thus , we expect an alpha particle to behave in a first approximation as a rigid entity ( `` core '' or `` cluster '' ) , which we represent by a scalar - isoscalar field @xmath53 .",
    "the smaller effects from deformations and other core - structure properties are accounted for in a derivative expansion .",
    "the breakdown momentum scale @xmath10 of this eft will be set by the lowest - energy degrees of freedom that are not incorporated explicitly in the lagrangian .",
    "since these include the nucleons within the alpha particle which can be resolved with a momentum @xmath54 mev and the pions which can be resolved with momenta of the order of the pion mass @xmath11 mev a reasonable estimate is @xmath55 mev .",
    "the eft provides an expansion of observables in powers of the ratio between the low - energy scales @xmath56 and @xmath29 and the high - energy scale @xmath10.be ground state .",
    "this argument is based on an extension of the halo eft to include explicit pion fields .",
    "in fact , it had been pointed out before @xcite that the long - range interaction of alpha particles is related to two - pion exchange , but in the context of nucleon scattering on an alpha particle built out of four nucleons .",
    "since the pion mass is not much smaller than the typical nucleon momentum in the alpha particle , we see no rationale ( for realistic values of the quark masses ) for an expansion in powers of @xmath57 in a theory with `` elementary '' alpha particles . ] around the resonance @xmath58 , we expect an expansion parameter of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "as the energy increases the expansion deteriorates and one should not expect the eft to be applicable to laboratory ( lab ) energies much above @xmath60  mev , a conservative estimate that corresponds to a cm momentum of about @xmath61  mev .",
    "since at low energies only @xmath20 waves contribute significantly to @xmath0 scattering beyond pure coulomb scattering , we introduce an auxiliary scalar dimeron field @xmath62 with `` residual mass '' @xmath30 , which couples to two @xmath5 fields .",
    "( observables are independent of the choice of fields . )",
    "we thus start with the following strong - interaction effective lagrangian : @xmath63\\phi + \\sigma\\,d^{\\dagger}\\bigg[i\\partial_0+\\frac{{{\\mathbf \\nabla}}^2}{4m_{\\alpha } } -\\delta\\bigg]d+g\\,\\big[d^{\\dagger}\\phi\\phi+(\\phi\\phi)^{\\dagger}d\\big ] + \\ldots\\ , , \\label{eq : lolag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath31 is a coupling constant .",
    "the `` @xmath65 '' represent interactions with higher derivatives .",
    "the sign @xmath66 is used to match the sign of the effective range @xmath67 .",
    "the existence of this sign merely reflects the non - physical , auxiliary character of the dimeron field  @xcite . in momentum space ,",
    "associated with the displayed bilinear terms are the @xmath5 propagator @xmath68 and the dimeron propagator @xmath69 other terms in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lolag ] ) can be treated as insertions of interaction vertices in feynman diagrams or corrections to the propagators ( [ eq : alprop ] ) and ( [ eq : dprop ] ) .",
    "different assumptions about the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath29 translate into different relative weights for the terms in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dprop ] ) , where @xmath70 . for example , in the present scenario all terms are of the same size , while in the @xmath35 case the energy and kinetic terms are of subleading order and the dimeron propagator reduces in leading order to @xmath71 .",
    "( the latter form gives rise in the amplitude not to a resonance but to a bound - state pole  @xcite at a momentum @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is given by eq .",

    "we postpone a discussion of the relative importance of various terms until the next section .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are introduced into the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : lolag ] ) in the standard way , that is , by both changing the derivatives into gauge - covariant ones , and introducing gauge - invariant interactions generated by the electromagnetic field strength . for practical calculations one usually works in a fixed gauge .",
    "the coulomb gauge is very convenient , since it allows a clear separation between coulomb and transverse photons .",
    "the former provides the leading electromagnetic interaction and is driven by the sommerfeld parameter @xmath74 with @xmath75 the fine - structure constant and @xmath76 the inverse of the `` bohr radius '' of the @xmath0 system .",
    "this parameter is enhanced by the presence of @xmath14 in the numerator , which , as we are going to see , makes @xmath77 large around the resonance and requires a non - perturbative resummation of coulomb photons . on the other hand ,",
    "transverse photons are suppressed @xcite by two powers of @xmath78 , and when in loops by extra powers of @xmath79 . since numerically @xmath80 , these interactions contribute to orders where they can be accounted for in perturbation theory beyond the precision we are working with .",
    "they can become significant only at energies comparable to the excitation energy of the @xmath5 core .",

    "( [ eq : tcs ] ) it is clear that the effect of a non - perturbative coulomb dressing of the strong - interaction amplitude apart from multiplying the amplitude by @xmath101 and from renormalizing the short - range parameters is to effectively replace the unitarity term @xmath44 by @xmath102 . in order to estimate the relative sizes of the various contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcsres ] ) , we turn now to a discussion of power counting . as we are going to see , at each order",

    "one considers @xmath103 and @xmath104 , with other couplings scaling with @xmath10 according to naive dimensional analysis . in this case",
    "the contribution of the bare dimeron propagator to the scattering amplitude at momentum @xmath43 comes not only from the dimeron mass , but also from its kinetic term .",
    "the simplest strong - interaction contribution is a bare dimeron propagator attached to initial and final external legs , which ( as seen by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : dprop ] ) by @xmath105 ) is of @xmath106 .",
    "a non - coulomb bubble diagram times another dimeron propagator brings an extra factor of @xmath107 . as a consequence , the bubble - chain resummation is necessary .",
    "the resulting denominator acquires the form @xmath108 .",
    "interesting in this power counting is the fact that at momenta @xmath43 the first two terms are suppressed by @xmath28 compared to the last one .",
    "therefore , all that is left at lo if the coulomb interaction is turned off is the unitarity term @xmath109 . in this limit , the @xmath26be system exhibits conformal invariance @xcite and the corresponding three - body system , @xmath45c , acquires an exact efimov spectrum @xcite .",
    "this scenario is a possible realization of the unitary limit .",
    "this picture is significantly modified when the coulomb interaction is turned on . in a non - relativistic system an @xmath110 potential breaks scale invariance and introduces the scale @xmath76 in the propagation of two charged particles . as we have seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcs ] ) , the unitarity term is modified .",
    "the balance between strong - interaction terms and coulomb - modified propagation depends on both the intrinsic strong - interaction scale and @xmath76 .",
    "we note that the scales are very different in @xmath0 than in @xmath37 scattering . while for the latter @xmath111 , for the @xmath0 system , @xmath112  mev and @xmath113  mev , so @xmath114 .",
    "for momenta @xmath58 , we are therefore in the deep non - perturbative coulomb region .. ] this case corresponds to large values of @xmath77 , where the function @xmath115 is significantly different from the usual unitarity term @xmath116 . using stirling s series @xcite , @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) gives @xmath118 the unitarity term is thus replaced by @xmath119 .",
    "this term is now a factor @xmath120 smaller in magnitude than the unitarity term in the absence of coulomb , and comparable to the effective - range term coming from the dimeron kinetic term .",
    "this can be captured automatically if we take @xmath121 , as it appears to be the case numerically .",
    "if all higher - order parameters are natural , in the @xmath20 wave the shape - parameter term @xmath122 is down by @xmath123 compared to the effective - range term @xmath124 , and so should be each of the successive terms . on the other hand , the @xmath99-wave scattering-``length '' term @xmath125 is down by @xmath126 compared to the @xmath20-wave scattering length @xmath127 , and further energy dependence and higher angular momenta bring in further powers of @xmath123 .    in this power counting , the coulomb - distorted short - range amplitude @xmath83 is given in lo by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcsres ] ) . including corrections in perturbation theory , we obtain up to nlo : @xmath128\\ , , \\label{eq : ampsc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is given by a higher - derivative term in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lolag ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to an expansion of the ere formula , @xmath129 for small @xmath94 . to this order ,",
    "all waves higher than @xmath20 are purely coulombic .",
    "higher orders can be calculated similarly .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ampsc2 ] ) holds for generic momenta @xmath43 .",
    "however , it fails in the immediate proximity of @xmath130 .",
    "this situation is familiar from another application of the halo eft to a resonance @xcite .",
    "the power counting works for @xmath43 except in the narrow region @xmath131 where the lo denominator nearly vanishes and a resummation of the nlo term , here associated with the shape parameter , is required .",
    "as one gets closer to the resonance momentum @xmath130 , higher - order terms in the ere are kinematically fine - tuned as well .",
    "this happens because the imaginary part of the denominator is exponentially suppressed by a factor @xmath132 and the real part gets arbitrarily small .",
    "( for @xmath7 scattering , multiple kinematical fine - tunings are prevented in the @xmath133 wave by the presence of an imaginary term @xmath134 @xcite . )",
    "this kinematical fine - tuning is not a conceptual problem . from the eft point of view , each new fine - tuning is equivalent to reshuffling the series and redefining the pole position . such a procedure works fine with a small number of kinematical fine - tunings , but is not practical in the present case .",
    "a better alternative is to perform an expansion around the resonance pole position .",
    "the situation here is analogous to the @xmath35 system , where we can choose to expand the amplitude around the bound - state pole @xcite rather than around zero energy .    a great simplification results from the fact that the resonance lies in the deep coulomb regime , where eq .",

    "the real terms shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : happrox ] ) can be seen as an expansion in powers of @xmath135 .",
    "of course in an asymptotic expansion at some point the remaining terms can no longer be expanded ; at that point the remainder should be treated exactly . in lowest orders ,",
    "however , we can use the successive terms shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : happrox ] ) : numerically , the terms up to @xmath136 work to better than 3% for @xmath137  mev .",
    "the expansion ( [ eq : happrox ] ) makes the physics around the resonance quite transparent . since the `` size '' of the resonance , @xmath138 , is much larger than the bohr radius @xmath139 ,",

    "we can thus lump these terms together , defining @xmath142 and so on .",

    "a better agreement should be achieved by an n@xmath211lo calculation .",
    "however , that introduces an extra parameter that is mostly determined by the scattering data , and this agreement could mask any possible inconsistencies that the phase shifts might have with the resonance parameters .",
    "the high nlo @xmath190/datum suggests that the resonance width and the @xmath20-wave scattering data set are not compatible with each other or , at least , one of them has overestimated precision . as a test we performed fits to scattering data without the input from the resonance width , within our nlo eft and the conventional ere framework . in both cases , description of @xmath20-wave phase shifts is much better but the resonance width is underpredicted , @xmath212  ev with ere and @xmath213  ev with eft .",

    "oddly , this tendency continues as one lowers the upper limit in the fit .",
    "reanalyses of the existing low - energy data or even new measurements seem necessary to resolve this discrepancy .",

    "the parameters of the @xmath23 resonance are indeed quite surprising . as we remarked , this resonance is associated with two poles of @xmath83 , the momenta of which are much smaller in magnitude than @xmath76 . as a consequence , there is an exponential suppression of the width , which is evident in eq .",
    "( [ eq : widthstrong ] ) .",
    "yet , the width is somewhat _",
    "large _ given the position of the resonance .",
    "it is remarkable that in order to fit both the resonance position and width one needs @xmath218 fm , nearly a factor 10 smaller in magnitude than the coulomb contribution to the energy - dependent term , @xmath219 fm .",
    "that is , although both @xmath220 fm and @xmath221 fm as expected from dimensional analysis , they approximately cancel producing a balance that is about 10% of either .",
    "this balance would itself have natural size if the width were a factor of 10 smaller than measured , or else if @xmath130 were 15% larger .",
    "instead , the existing cancellation effectively leads to either @xmath222 or @xmath223 .    since the position of the resonance determines to a first approximation @xmath224 , the seemingly accidental cancellation in @xmath189 translates into an exceptionally large @xmath73 , which is effectively @xmath225 or @xmath226 .",
    "the coulomb - modified parameter @xmath96 is thus suppressed by another power of @xmath28 compared to the assumed scaling when coulomb interactions are turned off .",
    "the values of ere parameters show that , as anticipated by the power counting we proposed , the strong - interaction effective - range term is comparable to both the scattering - length term and the electromagnetic @xmath88 .",
    "a power counting based on the scalings appropriate for @xmath35 scattering would instead miss the resonance in lo unless one also counted @xmath227 as @xmath29 , which is a numerical stretch .",
    "even so , the width would be far off , since @xmath228 , and convergence questionable .    although the results presented in this section were based on eq .",

    "in this paper , we have studied @xmath0 interactions within the framework of halo / cluster eft . from this perspective , the @xmath0 system is most extraordinary .",
    "eft is model independent to the extent that includes all interactions allowed by known symmetries .",
    "it is equivalent in the @xmath0 system to a truncation of the ere .",
    "the halo eft can be viewed as a formulation of the ere that can be used for other systems made of shallow - bound alpha particles and , together with results from refs .",
    "@xcite , also nucleons .",
    "we have designed a power - counting scheme that seems realistic for the @xmath0 system , but requires even more fine - tuning than the one in the @xmath35 system .",
    "it assumes that the parameter @xmath30 in the eft lagrangian scales as @xmath229 in the absence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "interesting in this scenario is the fact that at lo without coulomb the @xmath26be system would exhibit conformal invariance and @xmath45c would display an exact efimov spectrum .",
    "these exact features are broken by the coulomb interaction but some remnants of this behavior are manifest in the experimental spectra , such as the shallowness of the @xmath23 @xmath26be resonance .",
    "we have incorporated two new ideas in the halo / cluster eft .",
    "the most effective way of implementing an eft with resonances seems to be an expansion around the resonance pole , since it avoids the need for multiple kinematical fine - tunings and improves convergence .",
    "our study was significantly simplified by treating the coulomb function @xmath230 in a power series expansion in @xmath231 .",
    "this simplification may be very relevant when treating interactions with several alpha - particle clusters .",

    ", the rather high @xmath190 when the resonance width is fitted and the deterioration of the calculated width as one restricts the fit to lower - energy scattering data suggest that either the resonance width or the @xmath20-wave phase shifts have overestimated precision .    despite the phenomenological success of the proposed power counting",

    ", the observed resonance energy ( together with a natural - sized effective range @xmath189 ) tells us that @xmath236 . a similar scaling for @xmath96 emerges in @xmath7 scattering @xcite , but here we need a further cancellation between the finite pieces in @xmath30 and coulomb loops .",
    "this brings @xmath234 up by two orders of magnitude , or more than two inverse powers of the expansion parameter @xmath237 , to @xmath238 fm .",
    "uncomfortable as this fine - tuning by a factor of nearly 100 in the energy - independent part of the amplitude @xmath83 might be , it is not the whole story . as we have shown , both the resonance width and the higher - energy phase shifts require a fine - tuning also in the energy dependence of the amplitude .",
    "this @xmath239% additional cancellation ( together with the observed resonance energy ) further enhances @xmath234 by another factor of 10 , or about another inverse power of @xmath28 , leading effectively to @xmath240 fm , which is indeed the order of magnitude we obtain in our fit .",
    "this fine - tuning of a factor of @xmath241 1000 in @xmath0 completely overshadows the fine - tuning of @xmath241 10 from @xmath242 ( or from the pion decay constant @xmath243 mev ) down to @xmath244 mev in the @xmath35 @xmath245 channel .",
    "it has important consequences : for example , if the strong - interaction effective range @xmath67 were just 15 - 20% larger it would make the ground state of @xmath1be bound , presumably with far - reaching effects in nucleosynthesis .",
    "this context frames a fascinating picture for the @xmath0 system : a nearly conformally invariant system that is plagued by cancellations between strong and coulomb interactions .",
    "of course , fine - tuning has long been discussed in nuclear physics , but usually in connection to the position of the hoyle state of @xmath2c ( see , for example , ref .",
    "an immediate question is to which extent the latter arises from the fine - tunings we discussed here .",
    "together with previous and ongoing work on the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 systems @xcite , our results provide a framework for the description of cluster states in nuclei using eft , which can be seen as a generalization of the ere to systems that involve more than two bodies .",
    "an important extension of this work is to systems of more than two alpha particles .",
    "the strong @xmath0 interaction obtained here , together with an exact treatment of the coulomb interaction , should provide the necessary ingredients .",
    "since @xmath114 as discussed above , one might be able to simplify the calculation of coulomb effects by developing a perturbation scheme in powers of @xmath246 from the start .",
    "moreover , we conjecture that the @xmath2c hoyle state is a remnant of an efimov state that appears in the unitary limit .",
