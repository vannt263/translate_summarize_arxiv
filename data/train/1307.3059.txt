    "the @xmath5 methanol maser transition near 6.7 ghz discovered by menten ( 1991 ) is known to be closely associated with high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are thought to be a probe of just before and/or after the onset of the ultra compact ( uc ) h region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "various morphologies of the 6.7 ghz methanol masers have been obtained with past interferometric and vlbi observations . the linear distribution and velocity gradient of the masers",
    "have often been explained as an edge - on rotation disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a rotation disk hypothesis is supported by detections of internal motions surrounding a radio continuum source ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "several ring - like distributions of masers have been applied to a disk model with rotation plus expansion / infall motion ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , de buizer ( 2012 ) resolved the near- and mid - infrared emission at the locations of four methanol maser rings , and did not find consistent morphology of ir emission based on the hypothesis that the masers reside in the circumstellar disks .",

    "de buizer ( 2003 ) searched for h@xmath11 outflow signatures in massive young stellar objects with the linear distribution of methanol masers to test whether the outflows are perpendicular to the linear distributions .",
    "their search revealed that h@xmath11 emission is distributed almost parallel to the distribution of methanol masers in their sample sources .",
    "in addition , multi - epoch vlbi observations have shown the internal motions of methanol masers in massive star - forming region on1 , which suggested that the masers trace the expansion of the uc h region or a bipolar outflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 6.7 ghz methanol maser emission has been detected on size scale of 1000 au from young stellar objects , and can be a powerful tool to investigate the environment close to the forming high - mass protostar . however , internal motions of the 6.7 ghz methanol masers have been reported in limited number of sources so far ( e.g. g16.59 - 0.05 for @xcite ; g23.01 - 0.41 for @xcite ; on1 for @xcite ; @xcite ; iras 20126 + 4104 for @xcite ; w3(oh ) for @xcite ; afgl 5142 for @xcite ) .",

    "recent near - ir images imply that several h@xmath11 knots are distributed across irs2 , which suggest two bipolar outflows , powered by sources in irs 2 ( @xcite ) . in s269 , several signposts of star - forming activities such as oh and h@xmath11o masers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , high - velocity co wing emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and a herbig - haro object ( @xcite ) have been detected .",

    "the monitoring observations of 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission from 1999 to 2003 revealed that the three main methanol maser features have a sinusoidal time variation with a period of 668 days ( @xcite ) . from past vlbi observation of 6.7-ghz methanol masers in s269 using the european vlbi network ( evn ) , minier ( 2000 , hereafter m00 ) detected two maser groups named a and b ; there is a single maser spot at velocity of 14.70 km  s@xmath3 in group a , and eight maser spots at a velocity range of 15.0415.43 km  s@xmath3 distributed in a linear structure of @xmath015 mas at southeast  northwest direction with a clear velocity gradient in group b. the vlbi image by m00 showed that two groups were separated by @xmath15 mas in 1998 november , and suggested that the methanol masers are probably associated with irs 2 .",

    "as described in introduction , the 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission has been considered to trace various structures in high - mass star - forming region . here ,",
    "we discuss possible scenarios where 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission is associated with a bipolar outflow or a disk .",
    "the bipolar outflow scenario is the simplest explanation for the increase of the angular separation between two maser groups a and b. the axis of outflow would be a line joining the two maser groups a and b , in the direction at position angle of @xmath19 . a possible schematic diagram of the outflow model is shown in figure  [ fig : outflow ] .",
    "the viewing angle of the outflow ( @xmath106 ) is estimated to be 87@xmath23 , from the projected relative velocity of 13 km  s@xmath3 ( @xmath107 ) and the velocity difference between groups a and b of 0.6 km  s@xmath3 ( @xmath108 ) .",

    ". the location of the central star would be somewhere on the line segment between groups a and b. the solid angle of the outflow , @xmath111 is @xmath116 , and the opening angle of the outflow , @xmath117 , is an appearance angle of group a or b from the central star . here , we assume that the central star is located at the midpoint between the groups a and b. we obtain @xmath118 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 , adopting @xmath119 as the appearance angle of group a or b from the midpoint that @xmath120 6.5 km  s@xmath3 as half of the absolute velocity of the expansion between groups a and b , @xmath121 au as half of the distance between groups a and b , and a typical gas density for methanol maser environment @xmath122 @xmath123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "group c is also located on the extension of the line , and groups a , b and c could be associated with the same outflow .",
    "however , the direction at a position angle of @xmath19 is not consistent with a large - scale bipolar outflow in the southeast  northwest direction traced by several h@xmath11 knots ( knots 1,2,3,4,5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the internal motion of groups a and b could be driven by another outflow .",
    "the near - ir images have suggested the existence of a second outflow with a different axis traced by h@xmath11 knot 6 as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the second outflow is powered by sources in irs 2 , the outflow axis would be a line to connect irs 2 and h@xmath11 knot 6 .",

    "measurements of the absolute positions and proper motions of the methanol masers are necessary in order to confirm the relation between the maser spots and the h@xmath11 knots in southeast  northwest direction .        the disk scenario has often been proposed to interpret the maser distribution in a linear distribution with a velocity gradient , and could be another candidate to explain the observational results of the methanol masers . if the velocity gradient of the methanol maser emission is due to a rotation disk , the enclosed mass in the keplerian law is estimated to be @xmath125 , assuming an edge - on view of the disk with a disk radius of 1000 au , the total extent of the methanol masers .",
    "the estimated value is too small as a high - mass star forming region , in which 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission is exhibited .",
    "this fact has already been pointed out by m00 , which suggested the possibility that methanol masers are associated with a fraction of the rotation disk , resulting is an underestimate of the enclosed mass .    here",

    "using the estimated @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the resulting enclosed mass is @xmath138 , which makes this scenario unlikely .",
    "if the location of group a is allowed to be at the far side of the disk ( @xmath139 ) , much smaller values of the enclosed mass can be derived .",
    "when @xmath140 is @xmath141 , the minimum value of the enclosed mass is calculated to be @xmath142 , in a disk property with @xmath143 km  s@xmath3 and @xmath144 au .",
    "the enclosed mass of @xmath145 is still somewhat large as a single high - mass protostar .",

    "<S> we present the first internal motion measurement of the 6.7-ghz methanol maser within s269 , a small h region in the outer galaxy , which was carried out in 2006 and 2011 using the japanese vlbi network ( jvn ) . </S>",
    "<S> several maser groups and weak isolated spots were detected in an area spanning by @xmath0 200 mas ( 1000 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> three remarkable maser groups are aligned at a position angle of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> two of three maser groups were also detected by a previous observation in 1998 , which allowed us to study a long - term position variation of maser spots from 1998 to 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> the angular separation between the two groups increased @xmath2 mas , which corresponds to an expansion velocity of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> some velocity gradient ( @xmath4 km  s@xmath3 mas@xmath3 ) in the overall distribution was found . </S>",
    "<S> the internal motion between the maser groups support the hypothesis that the methanol masers in s269 could trace a bipolar outflow . </S>"
