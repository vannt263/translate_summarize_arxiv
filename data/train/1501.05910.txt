    "during the last years an intensive effort is being made to construct effective theories ( understood as a systematic framework that provides the classical equations of motion plus certain quantum corrections ) for quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the main motivation is to obtain testable results in scenarios where the complete knowledge of the underlying fundamental quantum gravity theory is not necessary , in such a way that quantum cosmology becomes an empirical science . in this respect",
    ", there are already several proposals and approaches in order to find quantum - gravity corrections to the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in the particular case of loop quantum cosmology",
    "@xcite , there are three key ingredients that one should consider in order to construct such an effective theory : _ holonomy _ corrections , _ inverse - triad _ corrections , and _ quantum - dynamical _ corrections .",
    "the origin of the first two corrections lies in the variables that are used in this specific theory : holonomies of connections and fluxes of spatial triads .",
    "holonomy corrections appear in a process of regularization , and they take the form of higher powers of the connection that amend the classical hamiltonian @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse - triad corrections are produced because , in order to avoid infinities , the inverse of a given triad is replaced by the poisson bracket between the corresponding triad and certain holonomy , which constitutes a classical identity @xcite .",
    "this procedure prevents , at the quantum level , the operator associated with the inverse of the triad from diverging , even when the triad itself tends to zero .",
    "the latter ( quantum - dynamical ) corrections are not specific to a loop quantization and arises due to the distributional character of quantum mechanics and the noncommutativity of the basic operators . in the present paper",
    "we will focus on these corrections , so let us analyze their origin in more detail .    in the procedure of quantization each classical degree of freedom",
    "is replaced by an infinite set of quantum degrees of freedom , usually described by a probability distribution ( wave function ) .",
    "another way to parametrize these degrees of freedom is by decomposing the wave function in its infinite set of moments .",
    "these moments then appear in the classical hamilton equations as quantum corrections . nonetheless , this distributional character is not specific of the quantum theory .",
    "in fact , only ideally , classical mechanics is non - distributional .",
    "when the initial conditions are not known with infinite precision , this uncertainty can be described by an initial probability distribution , and it is then necessary to consider the evolution of such a distribution on the classical phase space . as explicitly shown in @xcite , the evolution of a classical distribution can also be described in terms of its moments . and , interestingly , it turns out that the equations of motion for these classical moments can be obtained from the equations of motion for the quantum moments just by imposing a vanishing value of the planck constant .",
    "this is a neat classical limit of a quantum theory , which implements the idea presented in @xcite that the limit of a quantum theory is not a unique orbit on phase space , but an ensemble of classical orbits .",
    "note that the mentioned classical and quantum probability distributions are defined on different spaces .",
    "thus , their decomposition in moments allows us to compare their evolution .",
    "in addition , moments represent observable quantities that could be , in principle , experimentally measured .    therefore , one can distinguish two different origins of quantum - dynamical corrections . on the one hand ,",
    "the fact that an extensive ( as opposed to a dirac delta ) distribution needs to be considered makes the presence of moments in the equations of motion unavoidable .",
    "nonetheless , these kind of terms are also present in the evolution of a classical distribution and thus they are not genuinely quantum .",
    "for instance , as in the quantum case , they generically prevent the centroid of a classical distribution ( the expectation value of the position and momentum ) from following a classical trajectory on the phase space . on the other hand , the _ purely quantum _ or _",
    "terms arise due to the noncommutativity of the basic operators . in the equations of motion they appear as a power series in @xmath0 . following the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "the first ones will be named _",
    "distributional _ effects , whereas the latter ones _ purely quantum _ effects .",
    "it is important to stress that , if quantum cosmology is to become a testable theory , one needs to discriminate between purely quantum effects and effects that might appear just due to different technical or measurement errors , which would imply a classical probability distribution .",
    "let us briefly mention that this formalism based on a decomposition of the wave function in terms of its moments was first presented in @xcite for the case of a particle on a potential .",
    "a similar formalism was derived in @xcite for generic hamiltonians and on a canonical framework , but making use of a different ordering of the basic variables .",
    "furthermore , this formalism has been adapted to the case when the dynamics is ruled by a hamiltonian constraint , as opposed to a hamiltonian function @xcite .",
    "this is of particular importance in the context of general relativity , where the hamiltonian is a linear combination of constraints .",
    "it has also been extensively applied to different models of quantum cosmology : isotropic models with a cosmological constant have been studied in @xcite whereas , in the context of a loop quantization , bounce scenarios have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the problem of time has also been analyzed in @xcite within this framework .",
    "finally the classical counterpart of the formalism developed in @xcite , for the analysis of the evolution of a classical distribution in terms of its moments , was presented in @xcite and applied to the case of a particle on a potential in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will revisit , from the perspective of a classical probability distribution , the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the evolution of quantum moments on a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the numerical analysis of the present model in terms of a wave function is presented in @xcite , both for a geometrodynamical and a loop quantization . here",
    "moments will be defined in terms of geometrodynamical variables .",
    "our goal is to find differences and similarities between the quantum and classical ( distributional ) evolution of this cosmological model , given the same initial data for both cases , in order to study whether any moment has some distinctive or characteristic behavior under either the quantum or classical evolutions .",
    "as already commented above , the great advantage of the present formalism is that it considers the evolution of moments , which are observables , and no mention to an abstract mathematical object , as the wave function , has to be made .",
    "therefore , choosing the same initial data for both classical and quantum sectors is straightforward .",
    "this kind of question is very difficult to be posed in terms of a wave function , since one needs to somehow define its classical probability distribution analog and choose the _ same _ initial data .",
    "( this can be done via , for instance , the wigner transform but in general it is not positive definite and thus can not be strictly understood as a probability distribution . ) finally note that the present analysis is different from tying to define a _",
    "classicalization _ of a given quantum system .",
    "this latter is usually addressed by appealing to the wkb limit or different decoherence processes that annihilate the quantum interference ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_formalism ] the formalism for the evolution of classical and quantum probability distributions in terms of their corresponding moments is briefly summarized . section [ sec_cosmology ] presents the specific cosmological model under consideration . in sec .",
    "[ sec_numerical ] the results obtained with different numerical implementations are described .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusions ] discusses the main conclusions .",
    "let us assume a quantum mechanical system parametrized by the conjugate variables @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum moments associated to this system are given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the subscript weyl stands for totally symmetric ordering .",
    "the order of a moment @xmath5 is defined as the sum between its two indices @xmath6 .",
    "note that through this decomposition the wave function that describes the quantum state of the system gets replaced by its infinite set of moments @xmath5 , which only depend on time .",
    "moments that correspond to a valid wave function must fulfill certain relations due to the schwarz inequalities , see @xcite for a systematic derivation of such relations .",
    "the simplest , and probably most important , example is the heisenberg uncertainty principle that , with this notation , takes the following form : @xmath7    the dynamical information of these moments is encoded on an effective hamiltonian @xmath8 , which is obtained by performing a taylor expansion of the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator around the centroid : @xmath9 in order to obtain the evolution equations for the moments @xmath5 , as well as for the expectation values ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , it is enough to compute the poisson brackets between each of these variables and the above hamiltonian @xmath8 . in this way one obtains the following infinite set of ordinary differential equations : @xmath12 which is completely equivalent to the flow of states generated by the schrdinger equation .",
    "note that the first two equations are the usual hamilton equations plus certain correction terms that depend on the moments .",
    "if all moments were vanishing , these terms would completely disappear .",
    "one of the consequences of these terms is that the centroid of a quantum distribution @xmath13 does not follow a _",
    "classical point orbit _ ( the orbit obtained with an initial dirac delta distribution , for which all moments vanish ) .",
    "even so , this effect is not genuinely quantum since , as will be shown below , also happens for classical probability distributions .",
    "a closed formula for the poisson brackets between any two moments , which has been left indicated in eq . ( [ eqg ] ) , can be found in ref .",
    "for practical purposes , generically one needs to truncate the infinite system by introducing a cutoff by hand in order to be able to solve it .    on the other hand ,",
    "let us assume an ensemble on the classical phase space coordinatized by the conjugate variables @xmath14 .",
    "such an ensemble will be described by a probability distribution function @xmath15 , which will obey the liouville equation .",
    "this distribution function defines a natural expectation value operation on the classical phase space for any function @xmath16 in the following way , @xmath17 where the integration should be taken along the domain of the probability distribution .",
    "following the same procedure as in the quantum case , the classical moments are then defined as @xmath18 where @xmath13 are the coordinates of the centroid of the distribution : @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "[ for notational simplicity , and for the moment being , the same notation @xmath13 will be used for the centroid of both classical and quantum distributions .",
    "nonetheless , in subsec . [ sec_cosmologymoments ] specific notations will be introduced for each of them , to be used when the meaning is not clear from the context . ] on the contrary to the quantum case , here all variables commute and , therefore , the ordering inside the expectation value is irrelevant .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the evolution of these classical variables is obtained , as in the quantum case , by expanding the expectation value of the hamiltonian around the position of the centroid : @xmath21 in order to get the evolution equations for the classical expectation values @xmath13 and moments @xmath22 one just needs to compute the poisson brackets of different variables with this hamiltonian .",
    "the flow generated by the liouville equation for the probability distribution @xmath23 is then equivalent to the infinite set of equations obtained by this procedure .",
    "it turns out that the difference between the quantum and classical equations are just terms that appear in the former equations multiplied by even powers of planck constant @xmath24 , and are missing in the classical equations .",
    "such @xmath24 factors are present in the quantum system due to the noncommutativity of the basic operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , the classical equations of motion for the moments and expectation values can be obtained from their quantum counterparts by imposing a vanishing value of the planck constant .",
    "thus the classical limit of a quantum system , understood as @xmath27 , turns out to be very neat in this formalism . in particular , as can be seen , such a limit does not give a unique trajectory on the classical phase space but an ensemble of them .    due to the properties of the equations mentioned above ,",
    "it is possible to classify the quantum effects depending on its origin . on the one hand , _ distributional _ effects arise because , due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation , all quantum moments can not be vanishing .",
    "these effects are also present in the classical setting when considering the evolution of a spread probability distribution , for instance in the usual situation where the initial data are not known with infinite precision . on the other hand , the _ noncommutativity _ or _",
    "purely quantum _ effects appear in the quantum equations as explicit @xmath24 terms .",
    "as commented above , the origin of such terms lies in the noncommutativity of the basic operators . on the contrary to distributional effects , these are not present in the classical setting and are , thus , genuinely quantum .",
    "there are two classes of hamiltonians that have very special properties regarding the classical and quantum evolution they generate @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the quantum equations derived from any harmonic hamiltonian , which are at most quadratic on the basic variables , do not contain any @xmath24 term .",
    "therefore , the evolution that is generated by such a hamiltonian both in the classical and quantum settings is exactly the same . on the other hand , the hamiltonians that are linear in one of the basic variables , e.g. in @xmath10 ,",
    "generate the same evolution for the infinite set of variables @xmath28 as for their classical counterparts @xmath29 for all integer @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the cosmological model that will be considered on this paper is described by a hamiltonian linear in @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , when the cosmological constant is vanishing this hamiltonian will turn out to be linear in both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , for that case , the hamiltonian will be harmonic and the quantum and classical ( distributional ) evolutions it generates will be completely indistinguishable .    finally , let us comment that the stationary states can also be considered within the present formalism .",
    "the stationary states correspond to fixed points of the dynamical system under consideration and thus its corresponding moments can be obtained by solving the algebraic system of equations obtained by dropping all time derivatives from the equations of motion for @xmath31 . in particular , following this procedure ,",
    "the moments of the classical and quantum stationary states of the harmonic and the quartic oscillators were studied in @xcite .",
    "let us assume a cosmological model of a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe with a massless scalar field @xmath32 as matter content and positive cosmological constant @xmath33 . as usual in general relativity , this system is described by a hamiltonian constraint , as opposed to a physical hamiltonian . nonetheless , it is possible to deparametrize the system and use the conjugate momentum of the scalar field @xmath34 , which is a constant of motion , as a physical hamiltonian .",
    "the friedmann equation corresponding to this system reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scale factor and the prime stands for derivative with respect to the cosmic time . by choosing newton constant as @xmath37 for convenience ,",
    "it is straightforward to solve this equation for @xmath34 and define our physical hamiltonian as , @xmath38 where the absolute value has been taken to extend this hamiltonian to the region @xmath39 . in this way",
    ", the scalar field @xmath32 will play the role of time .",
    "nevertheless , this hamiltonian must still be written in terms of the canonical variables .",
    "such variables are directly related to the scale factor of the universe as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "then , the physical hamiltonian takes the following form @xmath42^{(1 + 2x)/(1-x)}|}.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath43 characterizes different possible cases of lattice refinement of an underlying discrete state , characteristic of a loop quantization @xcite .",
    "a value around @xmath44 seems to be favored by several independent phenomenological and stability analysis in the context of loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the ( geometrodynamical ) quantization studied here , with the usual canonical commutation relation , in principle this parameter does not play any role .",
    "thus , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath44 will be chosen since it turns out to be very convenient because it leaves the hamiltonian as a linear function of the position : @xmath45 the hamilton equations take then the following form , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the sign function and the dot stands for derivative with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the solution to these equations can be found analytically @xcite but here , in order to complement the discussion of that reference and to show in a more intuitive way the dynamics of this system in terms of the chosen variables , the corresponding phase space diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasespace ] . with the chosen value of the parameter @xmath43",
    ", @xmath10 is proportional to the volume of the universe @xmath48 , and one would then naturally define it as positive definite . nonetheless , for illustrational purposes , both negative and positive values of the position @xmath10",
    "have been plotted .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in the diagram , the phase space is symmetric under a change of sign in @xmath10 ( as the whole system is symmetric under a change of sign of @xmath36 ) . for positive",
    "@xmath10 ( as well as for negative @xmath10 ) , the phase space contains three disjoint regions separated by the lines @xmath49 .",
    "the upper and lower sectors correspond to @xmath50 , whereas in the middle sector @xmath51 .",
    "this latter region is the one that in principle is not allowed by the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) ( the momentum of the scalar field would need to be imaginary ) but has been constructed extending the hamiltonian by taking the absolute value inside the square root ( [ h_pphi ] ) .",
    "the explicit equation for the orbits can be obtained analytically , @xmath52 with @xmath53 an integration constant .",
    "note that positive values of the constant @xmath53 correspond to the upper and lower sectors , whereas negative values stand for orbits in the middle region . between those solutions , there is also the degenerate solution @xmath54 , that corresponds to a universe with zero volume .    in the upper region",
    "all orbits begin at the positive infinite of @xmath11 and vanishing @xmath10 , with a value @xmath55 of the affine parameter , and reach the asymptote @xmath56 at an infinite value of @xmath10 but at finite value of the affine parameter @xmath57",
    ". we will be interested in this region that corresponds to an expansion of the universe .",
    "the lower region is the time reversed of this latter one .",
    "there the system begins with an infinite volume and collapses .",
    "in fact , every orbit of this region is the analytic extension of the orbit with the same integration constant @xmath53 of the upper region for values @xmath58 of the affine parameter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the middle region is nonphysical and corresponds to bouncing solutions that begin with infinite volume , collapse until a minimum value of @xmath59 with @xmath60 and then expand again .",
    "since we will be working just in the upper sector , from here on , the absolute values that appear in the hamiltonian , as well as in the equations of motion , will be removed without loss of generality .    .",

    "in this appendix , the purely quantum terms for the equations of the moments @xmath195 and @xmath196 are shown .",
    "these are the terms with an explicit @xmath24 factor that appear in the right - hand side of their corresponding equations of motion : @xmath204 where dots stand for terms with no @xmath24 factors .",
    "as can be appreciated , the purely quantum terms that appear in these two equations are pretty similar , in the sense that the same moments appear ( except one ) with similar polynomial coefficients depending on the expectation values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as on the cosmological constant .",
    "nonetheless , the effect of such terms are very different on each case . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath195 is quite similar as @xmath205 during the whole evolution , keeping @xmath197 around one but increasing with time . on the other hand , for an initial gaussian state",
    ", @xmath172 takes a constant value around @xmath206 , independently of the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the behavior of the latter ratio @xmath172 can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] for the evolved gaussian initial state . in that case",
    ", it begins with a value of one , since both quantum and classical moments are initially equal and decreases until reaching again the constant value of 1/2 ."
