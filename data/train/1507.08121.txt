    "cooperative transmission methods have attracted significant interest over the past decade due to their applicability in size , power , hardware and price constrained devices such as cellular mobile devices , wireless sensors , ad - hoc networks and military communications @xcite .",
    "such systems exploit the broadcast nature and the inherent spatial diversity of wireless paths and are typically distinguished between regenerative ( decode - and - forward ) or non - regenerative ( amplify - and - forward ) relaying schemes . in general , the digital processing nature of regenerative relaying is considered more efficient than non - regenerative relaying , since the latter typically requires costly rf transceivers in order to avoid forwarding a noisy version of the signal @xcite .",
    "+ the performance of cooperative systems can be substantially improved by optimum allocation of the limited overall power to the source and relays of the network in order to minimize the overall energy consumption for given end - to - end performance specifications . among others ,",
    "this can be efficiently achieved by accurately accounting for the detrimental effects of multipath fading @xcite and the references therein .",
    "based on this , the authors in @xcite derived upper and lower bounds for the outage probability ( op ) of multi - relay decode - and - forward ( df ) networks over independent but non - identically distributed ( i.n.i.d ) nakagami@xmath1 fading channels . in the same context",
    ", the authors in @xcite analyzed the symbol error rate ( ser ) and op of df systems with relay selection over i.n.i.d nakagami@xmath1 fading channels , with integer values of @xmath2 , whereas a comprehensive analytical framework for a dual - hop multi - antenna df system under multipath fading was derived in @xcite .",
    "likewise , the performance of df systems over different fading environments was investigated in @xcite whereas analysis for the ser of dual - hop df relaying for @xmath3-ary phase - shift keying ( @xmath4psk ) and @xmath3-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( @xmath4qam ) over nakagami@xmath5 fading channels was reported in @xcite .",
    "in addition , optimum power allocation ( opa ) in dual - hop regenerative relaying with respect to pre - defined thresholds for the ser and op was analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this problem was also addressed in @xcite and @xcite for multi - node df relaying based on asymptotic ser and for a given network topology over rayleigh fading channels , respectively .",
    "finally , the authors in @xcite proposed power allocation schemes for the case of multi - relay df communications in the high - snr regime over nakagami@xmath1 fading channels .",
    "+ nevertheless , all reported investigations have been carried out in the context of either asymptotic or dual - hop scenarios as well as considering only rayleigh or nakagami@xmath5 fading channels , which is mainly due to the presence of cumbersome integrals that involve combinations of elementary and special functions @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , it is recalled that these fading models are based on the underlying concept of homogeneous scattering environments , which is not practically realistic since surfaces in most radio propagation environments are spatially correlated @xcite .",
    "this issue was addressed in @xcite by proposing the @xmath6 distribution , which is a generalized fading model that has been shown to provide particularly accurate fitting to realistic measurement results , while it includes as special cases the well known rayleigh , nakagami@xmath5 and hoyt distributions @xcite .",
    "based on this , several contributions have been devoted to the analysis of various communication scenarios over generalized fading channels that follow the @xmath7 distribution , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "motivated by this , the present work is devoted to the evaluation of the end - to - end ser in regenerative cooperative communication systems with multiple relays for @xmath4psk and @xmath4qam constellations over generalized fading channels as well as the corresponding opa analysis .",
    "specifically , the contributions of this work are summarized below :    * exact closed - form expressions are derived for the end - to - end ser of @xmath4psk and @xmath4qam based multi - relay regenerative networks over generalized multipath fading environments for both i.n.i.d and i.i.d scenarios . * simple asymptotic expressions are derived for the above scenarios for high snr values . * the corresponding amount of fading is derived for quantifying the respective fading severity . *",
    "optimal power allocation based on the convexity of the derived asymptotic expressions is formulated , to minimize the corresponding ser under sum - power constraint in all nodes . *",
    "the derived expressions are employed in evaluating the performance of the considered system and extracting useful insights . *",
    "it is shown that a 3db gain is achieved by opa for even a small number of relays . *",
    "it is shown that post - rayleigh fading conditions result to an improved performance by up to 4db compared to communications over severe fading channels . *",
    "it is shown that a maximum gain of about @xmath8db occurs , compared to ordinary direct communication , even if only few nodes are employed in non - severe fading conditions .",
    "this renders the resource constrained communication system a meaningful alternative for increasing the quality of service of demanding emerging wireless systems . *",
    "a simple algorithm is proposed for the computation of the generalized lauricella function .",
    "the reminder of the present paper is organized as follows : section ii revisits the considered system and channel models .",
    "the exact and asymptotic ser expressions for @xmath0qam and @xmath0psk constellations over generalized multipath fading channels are derived in section iii . the optimum power allocation scheme based on sum - power constraint",
    "is provided in section iv while section v presents the corresponding numerical results along with related discussions and insights . finally , closing remarks",
    "are given in section vi .",
    "we consider a multi - node cooperative radio access system consisting of a source node @xmath9 , intermediate relay nodes _",
    "@xmath10 _ , with @xmath11 , and a destination node @xmath12 , as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "each node in the system is equipped with a single antenna while a half - duplex decode - and - forward protocol is adopted .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid inter - relay interference the nodes in the system transmit signals through orthogonal channels . in phase i , the source broadcasts the signal to the destination and to all relay nodes in the network which yields @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the source transmit power , @xmath16 is the transmitted symbol with normalized unit energy in the first transmission phase , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the complex fading coefficients from the source to the destination and from the source to the @xmath19 relay , respectively , whereas @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the corresponding additive - white - gaussian noise ( awgn ) with zero mean and variance @xmath22 . in the next time slot ,",
    "if the @xmath23 relay decodes correctly , then it forwards the decoded and re - encoded signal to the destination with power @xmath24 ; otherwise , @xmath25 yielding @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the complex fading coefficient from the @xmath23 relay to the destination and @xmath28 is the corresponding awgn . it is also assumed that each path experiences narrowband multipath fading that follows the @xmath7 distribution and that mrc diversity scheme is employed at the destination . as a result ,",
    "the combined output received signal is expressed as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the optimal mrc coefficients for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively with @xmath34 representing the complex conjugate operator .",
    "it is recalled that @xmath35 distribution has been shown to account accurately for small - scale variations of the signal in non - line - of - sight communication scenarios .",
    "this fading model is described by the two named parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and it is valid for two different formats that correspond to two physical models @xcite .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the instantaneous snr @xmath38 is given by @xcite , @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average snr per symbol , with @xmath41 denoting statistical expectation , and @xmath42 denotes the channel variance .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the euler gamma function and the modified bessel function of the first kind , respectively @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given in terms of @xmath36 in two formats , as depicted in table i along with the fading distributions that are included in @xmath7 as special cases . in terms of physical interpretation",
    "@xmath36 denotes the scattered - waves power ratio between the in - phase and quadrature components of the scattered waves in each multipath cluster in format-@xmath47 and the correlation coefficient between the in - phase and quadrature components of each multipath cluster in format-@xmath48 .",

    "in this paper , we analyzed the end - to - end performance and optimum power allocation of regenerative cooperative systems over generalized fading channels .",
    "novel exact and asymptotic closed - form expressions for the ser assuming @xmath4psk and @xmath4qam modulated signals were derived over independent and identically distributed as well as independent and non - identically distributed channels .",
    "the derived analytic expressions were then used to draw insight of the different fading parameters in the generalized @xmath7 fading conditions and their impact on the end - to - end system performance .",
    "the offered results were subsequently employed in developing an optimum power allocation scheme which was shown to significantly outperform conventional equal power allocation strategy .",
    "it was also shown that the optimum power allocation scheme is practically independent of the scattered - waves power ratio parameter from source - to - destination , while it is dependent upon the number of multipath clusters as well as the selected modulation scheme and that it overall provides significant performance enhancement .",
    "the generalized lauricella function is defined by the following non - infinite single integral , @xmath51 the numerical evaluation of the above representation was also discussed in ( * ? ? ? * appendix v ) and can be straightforwardly evaluated with the aid of the following proposed matlab algorithm :    ....    function fd = lauricella(a , b1 , ... , bn , c , x1 , ... , xn ) ;      f = gamma(c).*gamma(a).*gamma(c - a ) ;     q = @(t )   f.*t.^(a - 1).*(1 - t).^(c - a - 1 ) . * ...      ( 1 - x1.*t).^(-b1 ) ... ( 1 - xn.*t).^(-bn ) ;     fd = quad(q,0,1 ) ....",
    "we provide the proof for the convexity of the ser expression by using . for mathematical tractability",
    ", we consider the proof for three relay - nodes . based on this",
    ", the proof for larger number of nodes scenario follows immediately . to this end",
    ", the asymptotic ser can be expressed as @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 are related to the channel parameters .",
    "let @xmath55 be functions which represent each term of @xmath56 .",
    "for example , we assign @xmath57 [ aa ] the second order derivative of @xmath58 w.r.t @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 the hessian matrix of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , can be determined as follows : @xmath63 the principal minors of the matrix @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . to this effect ,",
    "the symmetric hessian matrix @xmath68 is positive semi - definite ( psd ) . since @xmath69 and @xmath70 is psd , i.e. , @xmath71 , by the second order test in @xcite both @xmath58 and @xmath61 functions",
    "are convex .",
    "following the same methodology , it is shown that the functions @xmath72 are also convex .",
    "hence , by the sum rule of convexity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ( 3.2.1 ) ) it follows that the total function @xmath73 is convex w.r.t @xmath74 .",
