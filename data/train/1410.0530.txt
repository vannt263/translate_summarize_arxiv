    "historically , the definition of noise was related to the sound : a noise is an unwanted , unpleasant and confusing type of sound .",

    "an attempt to provide a more academic definition comes from music : noise is a non - harmonious or discordant group of sounds . again , however , the definition is not free from ambiguities because one man s",
    "noise is another man s music @xcite .",
    "a more scientific definition closer to our interest in electrical devices comes from communications : a noise is an electric disturbance that interferes with or prevents reception from a signal or information .",
    "for example , the buzz in a telephone call .",
    "thus , we realize that once we have a precise definition of what is a signal , the meaning of what is noise becomes perfectly clear : it is the difference between the measured value and the signal .      as discussed above , the answer to what is noise in electrical devices depends on our definitions of the electrical signal . for most dc applications ,",
    "the signal is just a time average value of the current . for frequency applications ,",
    "the signal is equivalently defined as a time average value , but using a shorter time interval ( related to the inverse of the operating frequency ) . in other applications , mainly digital applications ,",
    "the signal is related to a time average value of the voltage in a capacitor .",
    "hereafter , we will assume that the electrical signal is the dc value of the current , referenced by the symbol @xmath0 .",
    "all fundamental and practical issues discussed here for the dc signal ( and its noise ) can be easily and straightforwardly extended to those other types of electrical signals .",
    "what is measured in a laboratory for the dc signal is the time average value of the instantaneous current @xmath1 in a unique device during a large period of time @xmath2 : @xmath3 once we have defined the signal @xmath0 as the dc value , in principle , the noise can be quantified by time averaging the difference between the measured value of the current @xmath1 and the signal in a unique device : @xmath4 the square of the difference avoids positive and negative cancellations .",
    "+ at this point , it is very important to realize that @xmath1 presents very rapid fluctuations that can not be captured by the standard laboratory apparatuses .",
    "any experimental setup that measures the current fluctuations behaves as a low - pass filter ( i.e. the current fluctuations at frequencies higher than the apparatus cut - off frequency are not measured ) .",
    "therefore , the experimentally accessible information about the current fluctuations is not given by eq .",
    "( [ noise2 ] ) , but by the power spectral density of the fluctuations @xmath5 ( and its related magnitudes ) . from the wiener - khinchine relation ,",
    "the power spectral density can be defined as the fourier transform of the time average definition of this autocorrelation function @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",

    "( [ noise3 ] ) is consistent with the definition of the total noise defined in eq .",
    "( [ noise5 ] ) is non - negative and symmetric with respect to @xmath12 .",

    "( [ noise4 ] ) requires the knowledge of the measured value of the current during all @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we have to make predictions about the evolution of the electronic device while being ( continuously ) measured . in a classical scenario , such discussion about measurement",

    "we can compute the noise power spectral density @xmath5 from the ensemble average version of the autocorrelation defined in eq .",

    "it is important to emphasize ( for a posterior discussion ) that the probability @xmath42 implies a two - measurement process for each electronic device .",
    "the system evolves freely ( without interaction with the measurement apparatus ) from @xmath31 till @xmath23 when the current is measured , giving the value @xmath30 .",
    "then , the system evolves freely again until time @xmath43 , when the system is measured again giving @xmath44 . in summary , even if the ergodicity argument is invoked , the noise computation through the autocorrelation function requires , at least , two measurements at different times in a single device ( and the average over all @xmath21-devices ) .",
    "we anticipate that our computations with bohmian mechanics will not assume ergodicity ( which is not an obvious property for open systems out of equilibrium @xcite ) , but the prior expressions requiring a continuous measurement of the current .",
    "let us emphasize that the previous discussion is valid for either classical or quantum devices .",
    "the adjective _ quantum _ emphasizes that the signal and the noise are computed or measured in an electrical device governed by quantum laws @xcite",
    ". if the electronic device is not ergodic , expression ( [ noise4 ] ) requires a continuous measurement of the current @xmath1 . on the contrary , for an ergodic electron device , expression ( [ noise7 ] )",

    "any theory has usually two different planes .",

    "quantum noise is sensible to the ( ammeter ) measuring process . as stated in eq .",
    "( [ noise8 ] ) , in order to obtain the noise , the quantum system has to be measured , at least , twice .",

    "a typical scenario when discussing quantum noise in electrical devices is a flux of electrons impinging upon a partially transparent barrier ( located in the middle of the active region ) .",

    "each electron , after measurement at time @xmath23 , will appear randomly at the left or at the right of the barrier . the time averaged number of transmitted electrons will be proportional to @xmath2 , but the number of transmitted electrons fluctuates instantaneously because of the randomness of the transmission .",
    "these fluctuations of the number of transmitted electrons ( when compared with the dc signal ) are named partition noise @xcite .",

    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] that to reproduce the collapse of the wave function in bohmian mechanics we have to include a suitable interaction with an external apparatus .",

    "[ sec3 ] , it has been demonstrated @xcite that the error due to the exclusion of the apparatus from the simulations is almost negligible for the computation of the trajectories . in this way we can decrease enormously the computational burden , removing all the degrees of freedom related to the apparatus from our computations .    we can provide a more didactic discussion on why the previous technical approximation for the measuring apparatus works quite well when using bohmian trajectories . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we conclude that the reason why the wave function evolution in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] was wrong is due to the wrong possibility that an electron that is transmitted at time @xmath23 is later reflected at time @xmath43 .",

    "we can , for all practical purposes , completely ignore the reflected part of the wave function .",

    "+ finally , let us emphasize that , in principle , the measuring apparatus has also a role in the classical simulation of electronic devices .",
    "such interaction with the apparatus is included at a classical level , at best , by a proper boundary conditions for the scalar potential of the hamiltonian ( i.e. the poisson equation ) ensuring overall charge neutrality .",
    "obviously , this kind of approximation can also be included here .",
    "once we have _ practically _ eliminated the apparatus from our computations , a second kind of approximation regards the interactions among the electrons of our device .",
    "the active region of the electronic device can contain hundreds of electrons .",
    "also in this case , as we mentioned , the many - particle schrdinger equation can be solved only for very few degrees of freedom . a standard way to proceed consists then on reducing the complexity of the problem by _ tracing out _ certain degrees of freedom .",

    "given this last specification , we can provide an answer to the question : _ what is the ultimate origin of quantum noise according to the orthodox interpretation ? _ as we see in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the transmission or reflection of a single electron impinging upon a tunneling barrier becomes unpredictable .",
    "this is an example of a new source of randomness present only in quantum devices . according to the orthodox theory",

    "the wave function follows a deterministic law dictated by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the partition noise in the tunneling barrier discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] is due to the action of the operator which implements the random collapse of the wave function ( selecting the final wave function stochastically among the set of available eigenstates ) .",

    "it is important to notice that the measurement of the system does not introduce any additional randomness .",
    "the ultimate origin of the unpredictability is the fact that the uncertainty principle does not allow us to known the ( well - defined in the bohmian theory ) initial position of the particles in each experiment .    in summary , according to the orthodox interpretation , the partition noise has its origin in the stochasticity of the orthodox measurement process . on the contrary",
    ", bohmian mechanics says that the origin of noise is the uncertainty of the initial position of the trajectory in each realization of the experiment .",
    "although both theories give the same predictions , in the authors opinion , the latter has a more natural , common and understandable explanation of the origin of quantum noise . while following deterministic laws ,",
    "the transmission or reflection of a bohmian electron is unpredictable in a given experiment .",
    "a classical dice is a simpler example of a system following deterministic laws that becomes unpredictable .",
    "collapse in bohmian mechanics is so naturally derived that the quantum measurement problem , in general , and quantum noise , in particular , are somehow demystified .",
    "we underline that bohmian mechanics achieves the non - unitary evolution of the wave function of a measured system simply slicing the enlarged wave function in the configuration space ( without introducing any measurement - associated randomness ) .",
    "we accept that preferences between the explanation of the origin of quantum noise in terms of the orthodox or bohmian interpretations are subjective .",
    "therefore , in this paper we have also developed objective arguments about the computational advantages of the bohmian formalism .",
    "the facts that the measuring apparatus , what we call the ammeter , is directly included into the hamiltonian of the schrdinger equation and that the current values are computed from trajectories ( not from the wave functions ) allow us to study system plus apparatus scenarios ( or look for reasonable approximations ) .",
