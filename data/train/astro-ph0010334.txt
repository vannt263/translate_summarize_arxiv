    "h ii galaxies are a subsample of dwarf galaxies with a strong star formation activity leading to intense nebular lines easy to detect in objective prism surveys .",
    "the optical properties of h ii galaxies are dominated by their strong emission line spectra superposed on a weak blue continuum .",
    "the question , posed by sargent & searle ( 1970 ) of whether these are young galaxies forming stars for the first time seems now to have been answered by recent studies .",
    "h ii galaxies show an underlying stellar population of intermediate to old ages ( telles & terlevich 1997 , doublier _ et  al .",
    "_ 1997 , marlowe _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 1999 , cairs _",
    "et  al .  _ 2000 ) .",
    "the optical / near - ir colors of their underlying galaxies are similar to late type dwarf galaxies , although their structural parameters derived from brightness profiles indicate that h ii galaxies are more compact than late type quiescent dwarfs ( telles & sampson 2000 ; telles _ et  al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "their morphological classification splits them into two groups : type i includes the most luminous h ii galaxies , all of which present an overall irregular morphology . types ii s , on the other hand , are more compact and rounder and present a luminosity profile similar to that of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( telles , 1995 ) .",
    "the few h ii galaxies found to have a bright neighbor ( maybe by chance ) are all type ii s of regular morphology , contrary to what one would expect if galaxy interactions could be held responsible for the morphological disturbances found in type i s ( telles & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , h ii galaxies as a class are not preferentially clustered around faint low mass galaxies ( telles & maddox 2000 ) , but some are found to have hi companions ( taylor 1997 ) .",
    "the triggering mechanism of the present starburst in h ii galaxies is not at all clear , yet for these dwarfs internal processes must play a major role .",
    "here we show echelle data obtained at the william herschell telescope ( 4.2 m ) at the `` observatorio del roque de los muchachos '' ( orm ) at la palma on a sample of type ii dwarfs .",
    "our high resolution echelle data show a strong variation in the line profiles across the emitting region and even in the most compact sources , there is an indication of separate knots of star formation ( sf ) evolving concurrently within the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the presence of multiple knots of star formation within the line emitting regions are also observed on high spatial resolution images , in particular in the near - ir .",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) also identified knots which are possible super stellar clusters ( ssc ) .",
    "their individual properties may impose further constraints on the history of sf of a galaxy as well as indicate possible mechanisms able to trigger the present burst .    for our sample here",
    "we have defined different apertures across the h@xmath0 luminosity profile and have extracted the spectra corresponding to different emitting knots in every object .",
    "also the _ total _ spectra was obtained to mimic single aperture observations ( melnick _ et  al .",
    "_ 1988 ) , when it includes the ensemble of individual knots .",
    "the structure found in h ii galaxies has profound implications on several topics . in particular on issues such as star formation and its possible sequential propagation in h ii galaxies , and",
    "how is the ism structured in these galaxies .",
    "another issue central in this field of research is the validity of the interpretation , and use of the empirical correlations , of size and luminosity _ vs _ their supersonic line widths for high redshift galaxies .",
    "these correlations were first found for giant h ii regions by melnick ( 1979 ) , terlevich & melnick ( 1981 ) and melnick _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1987 ) and extended to h ii galaxies by melnick _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1988 ) and telles & terlevich ( 1993 ) .",
    "the fact that giant h ii regions and h ii galaxies have supersonic motions and follow the same correlations have made us use and refer to the whole emsemble of objects as a single family .",
    "this may indicate that process of massive cluster formation is similar in both h ii galaxies and giant h ii regions and it is the main reason as to why we will not differenciate between them in discussing their dynamical properties . here",
    "we describe in section  [ data ] and  [ analysis ] our selected sample and observational strategy , and section  [ results ] presents full detail of the results for each galaxy .",
    "a general discussion and a summary of the results is given on section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we have carried out long - slit echelle observations of a sample of 7 h ii galaxies ( see table 1 ) with the utrecht echelle spectrograph at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope at the `` roque de los muchachos '' observatory , la palma , spain , on the nights of 30 - 31/05/1997 .",
    "exposures of 1200s were obtained using a 2148@xmath22148 tek ccd and the 79.0 lines / mm echelle , reaching typical of s / n per pixel @xmath3 30 at h@xmath0 .",

    "the spectral resolution ( fwhm ) of our setup was 0.13   in the region and 0.18   in the region .",

    "it is clear that even the apparently most compact of our h ii galaxies ( e.g. um461 ; which spans across 11 \" ) splits into several components , or emitting knots .",
    "some of these may be true centers of stellar formation but others could simply be high density condensations ionized from the outside by the stellar radiation .    the emitting knots in every galaxy present different properties ( intensity , line width , etc . )",
    "however in all cases the velocity dispersion extracted from the @xmath9 fit to the spectra of every galaxy is , within the errors , identical to the velocity dispersion inferred for the main emitting knot found in every galaxy .",
    "this is a result now well established in the field of giant h ii regions ( e.g. muoz - tuon 1994 , sabalisck _ et  al .",
    "_ 1995 , muoz - tuon _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "in the seven galaxies in our sample the main knot peak intensity amounts to half , or more , of the total intensity derived for the total fit .",
    "the other main components of other knots , in every galaxy , amount to less than an order of magnitude of the peak intensity of the total fit , and in many cases their line width is smaller than that derived for the main emitting knot .",
    "this is also the case for all secondary components required to fit low intensity line asymmetries , or shoulders , although the peak intensity of these lines is usually much smaller . on the other hand ,",
    "the secondary components required to fit the wing emission of some of the knots in every galaxy contribute by much less than an order of magnitude to the total emission and are in all cases very broad lines with line width values well above the value measured for the main emitting knot .",
    "note however that uncertainties in the fit to low intensity wings are much larger .",
    "thus , the line emitting properties of h ii galaxies , including their supersonic @xmath1 value are in all our cases dominated by the emitting properties of the most intense knot . and",
    "thus , similarly to giant h ii regions , it seems that the main emitting knot reflects an intrinsic property generated by the recent starburst event ( see tenorio - tagle _ et  al .",
    "_ 1993 , and muoz - tuon _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "mrk 59 has a ne - sw oriented `` comet - like '' optical appearance ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "more recent studies have played special attention to this sub - class of h ii galaxies ( see noeske _",
    "et  al .  _ 2000 ) .",
    "it shows a conspicuous bright region , which clearly dominates the emission , located at the tip of an extended tail .",
    "the optical nucleus contains a rich substructure in nebular emission .",
    "we have defined five sub - regions in total .",
    "a clear peak in luminosity ( main knot ) is however identified with a size ( measured on the baseline of the h@xmath0 line spatial profile ) of @xmath4 10 arcseconds . at a much lower intensity level",
    ", there is an extended emission centered @xmath4 7 arcseconds from the main knot . in a similar way we have identified other intensity peaks showing emission along the slit which we named regions 2 and 3 . in this galaxy",
    "the main knot intensity totally dominates the output of the emitting region .",
    "this is a very compact dwarf .",
    "its image displays a single optical knot with some `` disk - like '' extended emission in broad band ( see figure  1 ) . on the long slit echelle ccd frame ,",
    "one can see a clearly defined h@xmath0 line as well as the [ nii ] doublet .",
    "the nebular emission spatial distribution is almost point - like with a slight asymmetry presenting an extended , lower intensity @xmath10 emission .",
    "the nebular luminosity profile , led us to define three apertures from which we have extracted and analyzed the spectra .",
    "we refer to them as main knot ( which overwhelmingly dominates the emission ) , region 2 and region 3 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line in the three apertures presents a remarkably symmetric profile , which however can not be well fitted by a single gaussian due to the presence of low - intensity wings .",
    "in fact a minimum of three gaussians are needed to obtain a good fit .",
    "the values derived for the three components are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "this is a classical example of a very nearby blue compact galaxy .",
    "its broad band optical morphology presents a typical core - halo structure with an extended light distribution .",
    "it has been the target of hst for studies of its stellar content ( schulte - ladbeck _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "the distance to vii zw 403 derived from these studies , and adopted here , is 4.4 mpc .    from our data ,",
    "we have identified along the slit a clear peak in emission : the main knot ; which produces half of the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the spectrum of the main knot is well fitted by a single gaussian with the possible presence of low intensity wings , too weak for being modeled .",
    "no signs of line splitting are seen at our present spectral resolution .",
    "besides the main knot there are two additional intensity maxima ( knots 2 and 3 ) very close to each other .",
    "the spectrum from knot 2 displays a gaussian - like @xmath11 line . on knot 3",
    "however , there seems to be a secondary component .",
    "the line can be reproduced by using two gaussians , very close in wavelength ( less than 1 ) .",
    "moving along the slit , immediately behind the two secondary knots one finds an extended emission ( named `` extension '' in table  [ tab2 ] ) , which despite the poor s / n we have fitted using a gaussian , with parameters similar to those obtained from the fit to the _ total _ spectrum of the galaxy .",
    "our echelle observations were taken with the slit oriented e - w ( p.a.= 90 ) crossing the optical core of the galaxy .",
    "this object has been of particular interest because it shows a very `` blobby '' structure , most visible in near - ir images ( telles _ et  al .  _ 2000 )",
    ". however , our present observation crosses the bright nucleus which , as described below , also presents a well resolved structure .",
    "bi - dimensional spectroscopy with integral field units will be very valuable in the near future to unveil its internal kinematics and help us answer the question of the origin of the present starburst .    from the luminosity profile across the slit",
    "we have identified two main peaks of nebular emission ( see figure  1 ) , labeled as main knot ( the brightest one ) and knot 2 .",
    "two more apertures have been defined for the analysis ; _ total _ includes the whole emission from the galaxy and an extension which rescues the extended , low intensity emission besides knot 2 .",
    "the main knot , shows the dominant h@xmath0 emission component .",
    "for the fitting to be successful also at the base of the line ( low - intensity wings ) , a second gaussian is needed .",
    "this has a much lower intensity but it is broader than the main component .",
    "the parameters obtained from doing the fitting with only one gaussian are also presented on table 2 and referred to as _",
    "global_. the secondary , low intensity , broad component is also present in the integrated ( _ total _ ) spectrum , which is clearly dominated by the emission from the brightest main knot .",
    "um461 appears along the slit as a point - like source ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we extracted its spectra from an aperture covering the main knot .",
    "a secondary much weaker second peak , west from main knot was also detected ( knot 2 ) . to compare the line profiles with those obtained using a single aperture spectrum , a third aperture covering all emission",
    "have been taken ( _ total _ ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission from the three apertures can be nicely fitted with a single gaussian profile .",
    "the main knot dominates the total nebular emission of the galaxy and therefore the spectra from the main knot and the total are rather similar .",
    "it is important to notice that the second - weak knot ( knot 2 ) , although clearly spatially separated from the main one , shares its main kinematic parameters ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "its optical appearance , as seen at the dss is that of a halo which engulfs a heart - like core with two clearly visible nuclei .",
    "our slit was positioned in the e - w direction ( p.a.=90 ) crossing the two nuclei .",
    "first thing to notice ( see figure  1 ) is that these two peaks are also visible in nebular emission .",
    "there the contrast is much larger , with a clear bright knot ( main knot ) and a much weaker one , separated by about 10 arcsec ( knot 2 ) .",
    "to make a comparison and to find the spatial trend of the emission lines two more apertures were defined : an aperture covering the region in between knots 1 and 2 ( interknots ) and an aperture including the whole emitting region ( _ total _ ) . in this galaxy [ nii ] ( 6583  )",
    "is also detected on the bright knot .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission of the brightest knot shows a good gaussian behavior on the line core , however at least a second gaussian is needed to account for the emission arising from the line base .",

    "our echelle data has led us to built a comprehensive data base of sizes , velocity dispersion and luminosities of the galaxies of our sample ; not only of the total parameters but also for the starbursts sub - structures found on each of them ( table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] describes the derived physical parameters of our sample .",

    "we use the current value of h@xmath16@xmath17(suntzeff _ et  al .",

    "these correlations have often been obtained using single aperture spectroscopy and their validity under better spectral and spatial resolution is a key issue to be verified .",
    "note that in each of our galaxies , the difference in the velocity centroids of the various components is in all cases less than 1   ( from table  [ tab2 ] ) , and thus , the velocity shift between components can not account on its own for the velocity dispersion detected in the total spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "the velocity dispersion in our data set thus reflects an intrinsic property of each of the components and in some cases this is indeed supersonic ( @xmath13 @xmath23 c@xmath24 ; the sound speed in the ionized gas ) .",

    ", we conclude that irrespectively of the structure that a galaxy ( or a giant h ii region ) may have , the main emitting knot is likely to be sitting at the bottom of the gravitational potential well of its host galaxy , and therefore the overall motions are dominated by the mass of the complexes of gas and stars .",

    "without a doubt ,",
    "one of the most intricate issues in the field of giant h ii regions , and now also of h ii galaxies , is the origin of their supersonic velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 @xmath23 @xmath33 ) .",
    "it has long been established that a simple agglomeration of a large number of h ii regions can not lead to the dominant supersonic line profiles , and thus , giant h ii regions , and h ii galaxies , constitute a different class of objects .",
    "different not only because of the size of their emitting regions and the fact that they are powered by recent violent bursts of star formation , but also because of their essence : their peculiar inner dynamics .",
    "it is now well established that the supersonic line width correlates with the size of the emitting region ( size @xmath19 @xmath22 ) and luminosity ( @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 ) of the ionized regions ( terlevich & melnick 1981 , melnick _",
    "et  al .  _ 1987,1988 ,",
    "telles & terlevich 1993 ) .",
    "the fact that the correlations are similar to the relations inherent to virialized stellar systems such as globular clusters , spiral bulges and the cores of elliptical galaxies , led terlevich & melnick to postulate that giant h ii regions and h ii galaxies are themselves virialized systems and thus that the measured gas velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 ) should directly relate to their total mass . in their original scenario terlevich &",
    "melnick envisaged a gravitational potential that forced the collective motion of clumps of gas to present the supersonic @xmath1 values .",
    "however , in our sample and in the recent finding in giant h ii regions the massive emitting knots present a relative velocity unable to explain the observed supersonic @xmath1 values ( see tenorio - tagle _ et  al .  _",
    "1993 1996 , and references therein ) . instead , the brightest knots present an intrinsic value of sigma formerly ascribed to the whole ionized region .",
    "this fine tuning regarding the size of the supersonic @xmath1 region and its luminosity has brought the empirical correlations into a much better agreement with what is expected from a virialized system .",
    "on the theory ground , virialization is now believed to have lots to do with the motion of the low - mass stars moving in the gravitational potential of the system while undergoing winds .",
    "this enhances their cross - section and allows them to cause the stirring of the gas left - over from the star formation event ( see tenorio - tagle _ et  al .",
    "_ 1993 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "some authors have claimed that the supersonic line widths could result from a plethora of unresolved expanding shells caused by the mechanical energy of the large number of massive stars powering each of the sources ( see chu & kennicutt 1994 and references therein ) . in the latter case",
    "however , there is no obvious way to explain the empirical correlations and thus it has been argued that the measured line widths follow the correlations simply due to a lack of resolution in the integrated spectra obtained from single aperture observations ( but see also tenorio - tagle _ et  al .  _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "our results confirm and extend the empirical correlations found for giant h ii regions and h ii galaxies .",
    "this fact has profound implications both on the observations of h ii galaxies and on the interpretation of their supersonic line width .",
    "enhanced spectral and spatial resolution seems to unveil an intricate structure in h ii galaxies .",
    "note that the previously measured ( single aperture ) supersonic motions in fact arise from regions of much smaller dimension than that occupied by the full extent of the ionized gas .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] and figure  [ fig4 ] for compact h ii galaxies , accurate determinations of the size and luminosity of the region presenting the supersonic @xmath1 values nicely outline the correlations .",
    "h ii galaxies when resolved , present several emitting knots with a variety of shapes , luminosity and @xmath1 values .",
    "however , we have shown that in these cases the global integrated value agree very closely with the properties derived for the main emitting knot .",
    "this is simply because the intrinsic properties ( luminosity , velocity dispersion ) of a galaxy are dominated by the central ( core ) component .    a fine calibration of these relations for local h ii galaxies may be of great importance if used as a distance indicator of galaxies at large redshift , since h ii galaxies are easy to find at great distances ( see also melnick _ et  al .  _",
    "particularly , as the global line emitting properties reflect the intrinsic properties of the central core component , observations even with poor spatial resolution could accurately define the luminosity and @xmath1 values of the dominant central core in every galaxy .",
