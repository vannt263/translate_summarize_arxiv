    "in the last decades , traffic problems have attracted much attention of a community of physicists because of the observed nonequilibrium phase transitions and various nonlinear dynamical phenomena .",
    "a number of traffic models have been proposed to investigate the dynamical behavior of the traffic flow , including fluid dynamical models , gas - kinetic models , car - following models and cellular automata ( ca ) models@xcite .",
    "these dynamical approaches represented complex physical phenomena of traffic flow among which are hysteresis , synchronization , wide moving jams , and phase transitions , etc . among these models , the cellular automata approaches can be used very efficiently for computers to perform simulation@xcite .",
    "the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model is a basic ca models describing one - lane traffic flow@xcite .",
    "based on the nasch model , many ca models have succeeded in modeling a wide variety of properties of vehicular traffic@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the problems of traffic jams , environmental pollution and energy dissipation caused by traffic have become more and more significant in modern society . financial damage from traffic due to",
    "energy dissipation and environmental pollution is huge every year . in accordance with previously reported results in refs.[15 ] ,",
    "more than 20% fuel consumption and air pollution is caused by impeded and  go and stop  traffic .",
    "most recently , the problem of energy dissipation in traffic system has been investigated in the framework of car following model , city traffic model and nasch model with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , respectively@xcite . and",
    "analytical expressions for energy dissipation have also been provided in the nondeterministic nasch model with pbc in the case of @xmath6 and free - flow state@xcite .",
    "however , the effects of boundary condition on energy dissipation have not been discussed yet .",
    "the most significant difference between systems with open and periodic boundary conditions is the vehicle density @xmath7 . in a periodic system , which has no maximum current phase ,",
    "vehicle density is considered as an adjustable parameter . in systems with open boundary conditions ( obc ) , however , there are two adjustable parameters , namely the injection rate @xmath8 and the extinction rate @xmath2 , and the vehicle density @xmath7 is only a derived parameter . compared with periodic systems",
    ", it implies that open systems show a different behaviour of quantities such as the global density , the current , the density profile and even the microscopic structure of traffic phase@xcite .",
    "therefore , energy dissipation in the ca model with obc , which is relevant to many realistic situation in traffic , should be further investigated .    in this paper , we investigate the energy dissipation rate within the framework of the deterministic and nondeterministic nasch model with obc .",
    "the behaviours of the energy dissipation rate in different traffic phase are distinct .",
    "theoretical analyses are presented in low - density , high - density and maximum current phase in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "the influences of the speed limit @xmath9 on the energy dissipation are also investigated .",
    "energy dissipation caused by braking is related not only to the velocity of vehicles , but also to the headway distribution .",
    "thus , the behaviour of the energy dissipation rate is more complex than simpler quantities , and should be further investigated .",
    "the results of this article may lead to a profound understanding of some features of traffic system or may provide schemes for reducing energy dissipation of the existing traffic network .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the description of the model and the definition of energy dissipation rate . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical studies are given , and the influences of the injection and extinction rate on energy dissipation rate are considered . and",

    "finally , the conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "our investigations are based on a one dimensional cellular automaton model introduced by nagel and schreckenberg .",
    "the model is defined on a single lane road consisting of @xmath10 cells of equal size numbered by @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath10 and the time is discrete",

    "@xmath30 which means out of the system , a vehicle with speed @xmath31 is created with probability @xmath32 .",
    "the vehicle immediately moves forward in accordance with the nasch rule .",
    "if the site @xmath33 is occupied by a car , the injected vehicle at site @xmath30 is deleted . at @xmath34",
    "a  block  occurs with probability @xmath35 and causes a slowing down of the vehicles at the end of the system .",
    "otherwise , a vehicle may leave freely from the end of the system .",
    "it should be mentioned that for @xmath6 the model above in the nondeterministic case is different from parallel updated asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) with open boundary conditions@xcite . in the asep model ,",
    "if the site @xmath10 is occupied then the particle on that site exits with probability @xmath2 , irrespective of their velocity . in the model above , however , the extinction of the vehicle at site @xmath10 depends not only on the probability @xmath2 , but also on the braking probability @xmath36 even if the vehicle with @xmath37 is at site @xmath10 and there is no  block  at site @xmath38 , it may fail to exit because of being randomly delayed .",
    "this difference may influence the current and phase transition , which will be analysed in the following section . in the deterministic case , however , the model above with @xmath39 is identical with parallel updated asep with obc , for there is no stochastic delay .",

    "the particles are  self - driven  and the kinetic energy increases in the acceleration step . in the stationary state ,",
    "the value of the increased energy while accelerating is equivalent to that of the dissipated energy caused by speed - down , and the kinetic energy is constant in the system . in the simulation , the system size @xmath49",
