    "since polaron physics is governed by lattice dynamics on the unit - cell scale , the discrete nature of the crystal can not be neglected.@xcite    the resulting problem of an interacting e - h pair with coupling to quantum phonons represents a long - standing open question in condensed matter physics . whereas some exact results are available without phonons,@xcite standard methods such as perturbation theory , and variational or adiabatic approximations@xcite are often of uncertain reliability .",
    "furthermore , computational approaches are very demanding , and we are not aware of any exact results for quantum phonons .    here",
    "we present unbiased numerical results for the quantum lattice x - p within a simple e - h model , obtained by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "this method , well established in the field of polaron physics , treats all couplings on the same footing and is not restricted to a specific x size or parameter region .",
    "our model study of several different hamiltonians yields important results for the effects of carrier - phonon interaction on x properties .",

    "spin degrees of freedom are not taken into account , and we assume a tight - binding band structure with @xmath19 symmetry for both e and h , neglecting the existence of a band gap ( which here only leads to a shift of energies ) .",
    "of course this model is too simple to make a direct comparison with materials .",
    "nevertheless , it does describe the physics of a coulomb - bound , itinerant e - h pair whose constituents couple individually to quantum phonons and  in the absence of coupling to the lattice  captures the familiar crossover from a small to a large exciton with increasing bandwidth ( see sec .

    "important aspects arise from the fact that the coupling of e and h to the lattice can either be of cooperative or compensating nature .",
