    "then , a time - dependent driving voltage is applied to a electrostatically coupled metallic gate placed on top of the dot . as a consequence ,",
    "dc transport is impossible and the system response is purely dynamical .",
    "the low - frequency admittance measured with cryogenic low - noise amplifiers can be understood from the serial combination of a charge relaxation resistance and a quantum capacitance  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the linear regime ( small ac amplitudes ) the charge relaxation resistance is quantized for a single spin - polarized channel  @xcite , a theoretical prediction that was experimentally confirmed  @xcite . for drivings with larger amplitudes ( nonlinear regime ) ,",
    "the system works as an on - demand single - electron source  @xcite , in analogy with single - photon sources  @xcite , with alternate sequences of electron emission and absorption during a driving period in the fast ( ghz ) regime .",
    "when the voltage pulse has a lorentzian shape  @xcite , recent progress has shown that the holes can be efficiently removed from the stream of excitations  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena imply the observation of quantized currents ensured by charge quantization , which might be useful in metrology applications  @xcite and quantum computation designs  @xcite .",
    "now , tunneling electrons feel repulsive interactions that yield coulomb blockade , a prominent effect in small - capacitance conductors which manifests itself as an increased resistance of a quantum dot junction at finite bias voltages  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the effect is quite ubiquitous in nanoscale systems and arises not only in quantum dots but also in carbon nanotubes  @xcite , molecular transistors  @xcite , and optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to investigate the role of coulomb blockade effects in single - electron sources",
    ". this is the goal we want to accomplish in this work .",
    "we begin by noticing that electron - electron interactions have been widely analyzed in the quantum @xmath0 circuit  @xcite .",
    "however , these works have mostly focused on the linear regime ( for an exception , see ref .",
    "the nonlinear regime is interesting because both the capacitance and the charge relaxation resistance acquire an explicit time dependence  @xcite .",
    "this result was found for noninteracting electrons . here , we give full expressions for the capacitive and the dissipative parts of the current valid in the case of strong interactions that lead to coulomb blockade effect .",
    "we predict that this effect should be visible as a splitting of the dynamical current peaks for both emitted and absorbed electrons .",
    "importantly , we find that the charge remains quantized for large enough charging energies .    .",

    "we consider a single - level quantum dot ( energy @xmath2 ) coupled to a fermi sea of electrons ( fermi energy @xmath1 ) .",
    "the coupling region between the dot and the reservoir is typically a pinched - off quantum point contact that we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] with a tunnel barrier .",
    "this part represents the resistive component of the quantum circuit , through which electrons can hop on and off the dot .",
    "the position of @xmath2 can be tuned with a dc gate potential applied to the point contact  @xcite ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] ) . additionally , the dot is coupled to a nearby gate terminal with an externally applied harmonic potential @xmath4 .",
    "this is the capacitive part of the @xmath0 circuit . finally , a charging energy @xmath3 is required to charge the dot with two electrons having opposite spins .",
    "the situation considered in this paper is experimentally relevant for small dots .",
    "the case of large dots with many quantum levels was treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a hartree - fock approximation was employed to account for coulomb interactions and screening effects . here",
    ", we consider the anderson model with a single level and a constant interaction energy .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to the fermi liquid limit connected to the korringa - shiba relation  @xcite , unveiling strong departures of the charge relaxation resistance from universality  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical discussion starts with the anderson hamiltonian of a mesoscopic capacitor , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 describes the single reservoir , @xmath7 is the tunnel coupling between the reservoir and the quantum dot ( qd ) and @xmath8 models the qd :    @xmath9    with @xmath10 the occupation number operator and @xmath11 including both the qd energy level , @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 denotes the zeeman splitting due to interaction with an external magnetic field ) , and the oscillating potential applied to the gate , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ac amplitude and @xmath16 is the driving frequency .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath17 and @xmath4 can be tuned independently , as experimentally demonstrated  @xcite , with a dc and ac voltage , respectively , applied to the quantum point contact and the gate electrode : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this allows us to treat the position of the qd level relative to the fermi energy and the ac amplitude as separate parameters in our calculations . in the hamiltonian @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 labels the electron spin and hereafter we consider the nonmagnetic case ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "equation   thus represents the electronic charge conservation . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on @xmath34 because it can be directly expressed in terms of the qd green s function without further manipulation , as shown below . the physical current @xmath33 ( since it amounts to a flux ) can then be obtained immediately from eq .  .",
    "let @xmath40 be the lesser green s function  @xcite for the dot operators .",
    "clearly , the qd occupation @xmath41 can be written in terms of the lesser green s function . the current is hence calculated as @xmath42 where in the last line we express the lesser dot green s function in a mixed time - energy notation .",
    "this representation is especially useful for nonstationary scattering problems in the adiabatic limit  @xcite .",
    "its connection with the original double time picture and the corresponding fourier transform is discussed in app .",
    "[ app : fourier ] .",
    "our regime of interest here is the adiabatic case ( small frequency @xmath16 ) but arbitrary values of the ac amplitude @xmath15 . in that case , the green s function is expected to display small deviations around a frozen state in time characterized by a stationary scattering matrix with time - dependent parameters .",
    "this approximation is good when @xmath43 is the smallest energy scale of our problem . for a prototypical @xmath0 circuit  @xcite , @xmath44  @xmath45ev , which is at least fifty times smaller than the tunnel coupling @xmath46  @xmath45ev",
    "therefore , the electron interacts only weakly with the ac potential before tunneling into or out of the qd .",

    "second - order terms and beyond are neglected , which suffices for the purposes of this work .",
    "( inductive - like effects have been studied in ref .",
    "we stress that the zeroth - order ( frozen ) term in @xmath16 is still time dependent .",
    "no assumption has been made on the strength of the amplitude , which can be arbitrarily large , driving the system into the nonlinear regime .    substituting eq .   into eq .  , we find similar expansions for the occupation and the current , @xmath50 from the definition given by eq .",
    ", it follows that the leading order for the current is first order in @xmath16 . to be consistent",
    ", we therefore keep the current terms in eq .   up to second order in @xmath16 .",
    "the physical implication says that @xmath51 represents a capacitive - like contribution while @xmath52 is understood as a dissipative component  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation can be substantiated by introducing a quantum @xmath0 circuit model ( a capacitor and a resistor in a series with an applied ac potential ) with time - dependent capacitance and resistance functions , @xmath53 this relation is valid at low frequency for both the linear and the nonlinear regimes . in eq .",
    "@xmath54 is the differential capacitance and @xmath55 the differential resistance .",
    "both depend on time because they constitute a generalization of the linear - response quantum capacitance @xmath56 and charge relaxation resistance @xmath57  @xcite to the nonlinear ac transport regime  @xcite . combining eq .   with eq .",
    ", we can find expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , our goal is first to obtain an equation for @xmath58 in the presence of coulomb interactions and oscillating voltages .",
    "the temporal evolution of the dot green s function is determined from the commutator of @xmath59 with @xmath20 ( heisenberg equation of motion ) .",
    "it is convenient to consider the time - ordered green s function @xmath60 .",
    "after some straightforward steps , we find that the time - ordered green s function satisfies the integral ( dyson ) equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is the tunnel self - energy with @xmath64 the isolated reservoir ( dot ) green s function in the absence of the ac driving potential .",
    "the retarded / advanced and lesser green s functions can then be otained from the langreth s analytic continuation rules  @xcite .    to consider the effect of @xmath3",
    ", we now generate an additional integral equation for the correlator @xmath65 in eq .  :",
    "@xmath66 where three new correlation functions arise .",
    "since we are interested in the coulomb blockade regime , we can neglect charge and spin excitations .",

    "thus , we obtain an integral equation that depends on the dot green s function only , @xmath73 importantly , we have changed our notation @xmath74 in order to distinguish between the green s function corresponding to the the coulomb blockade regime ( @xmath75 ) and that for noninteracting electrons ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "this is done for later convenience since we will show that interacting results can indeed be expressed using noninteracting quantities .    a frequency expansion of eq .   yields ( we refer the reader to appendix  [ app : serie.0 ] for details ) :    [ eq : gs0 ] @xmath77    where the superscript `` @xmath78 '' labels the retarded / advanced green s function and the tunnel self - energies read @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",

    "the weight factors depend themselves on shifted occupations calculated in the absence ( @xmath152 ) and in the presence ( @xmath153 ) of interactions . nevertheless , the analytic expression for the resistance is too lengthy to be included here . for the numerical calculations we shall use the definition @xmath154    .",

    "[ fig : cqrqcbueac10](a ) ] , we depict @xmath54 in units of @xmath118 . as expected , the capacitance , which mimics the instantaneous density of states , undergoes a double splitting for finite charging energies ( cf . the case @xmath72 showed in solid black line with the case @xmath138 in dashed blue line ) .",
    "the four - peak structure arises from multiple passings ( upward and downward ) of the resonances @xmath2 and @xmath133 across the fermi energy .",
    "our calculations predict that four peaks ( two in each half cycle ) will appear in the coulomb blockade regime ( @xmath126 ) and for sufficiently low temperature .",
    "further increase of @xmath3 leads to a recovery of the two peaks but with reduced amplitude .",
    "in general , for energies @xmath155 ( with @xmath156 ) the resonance lying at @xmath133 is not able to fulfill the resonant condition and we recover the @xmath72 case but with half - height peaks due to the @xmath157 occupation ( on average ) of each spin level .",
    "we show the differential resistance @xmath158 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cqrqcbueac10](b ) . already for @xmath72",
    "we find departures from the universal charge relaxation resistance value @xmath159 .",
    "these deviations are stronger as @xmath3 increases and lead to _ negative _ values of @xmath158 for certain values of time .",
    "therefore , we can not identify the product @xmath160 with a delay time since this interpretation is physically meaningful in linear response only .",
    "in fact , at some points the resistance diverges .",
    "analogous resistance divergences have been found in the thermoelectric trasnport  @xcite but here the effect is purely electric .",
    "equation   dictates that the differential resistance is inversely proportional to the derivative of the differential capacitance . as a consequence , @xmath158 diverges whenever this derivative vanishes .",
    "this implies that the resistance divergences are correlated with the maxima or minima of @xmath161 , as can be easily inferred from a close inspection of fig .",

    "parameters : @xmath139 and @xmath96.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a natural question is then whether the strong fluctuations of the nonlinear resistance away from its quantized value persist in the linear regime . to examine this",
    ", we take the limit @xmath162 in eqs .   and  .",
    "we find for @xmath163 the expressions @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "interestingly , eqs .   and",
    "depend on the mean frozen occupation .",
    "the capacitance is a weighted sum of densities of states and will therefore show two peaks at @xmath167 and @xmath168 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : cqrqcbvac0](a ) where we depict the capacitance as a function of the dot level ] . even in the presence of interactions",
    "the capacitance can be traced back to a spectroscopic measure of the dot spectral function . however , the charge relaxation resistance is no longer constant as in the noninteracting case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cqrqcbvac0](b ) we observe a strong energy dependence of @xmath158 with @xmath2 .",
    "only when the dot level is clearly off resonance ( either @xmath169 or @xmath170 ) do we recover the universal value @xmath171 . in both cases",
    "the reason is clear  either for @xmath2 well above @xmath1 or for a deep level configuration , interactions play no role and the noninterating result is restored . in the electron - hole symmetry point",
    "[ @xmath172 the system behaves effectively as a single - channel conductor because the occupation per spin is @xmath157 . for dot energies in between the electron - hole symmetry point and the off - resonant situation",
    ", the charge relaxation resistance acquires its maximum value , which is sample - dependent .",
    "we attribute this resistance increase to the maximal charge fluctuations that operate around the point @xmath173 and its symmetric counterpart @xmath174 .",
    "we notice that significant enhancements of @xmath175 have been previously reported in the literature for interacting @xmath0 circuits  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated coulomb blockade effects in a coherent source of single - electrons driven by a monochromatic excitation . using a nonequilibrium green s function approach valid for arbitrarily large amplitudes of the ac potential , we have found that the current peaks associated to electron emission and absorption become split in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the effect is particularly intense for the emitted charge , with additional quantization steps as a function of the ac forcing .",
    "our model is capable of describing the noninteracting case ( @xmath72 ) up to strong interactions ( @xmath176 ) within the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "while for @xmath72 our theory produces two - electron or two - hole pulses , for @xmath176 our model predicts single - electron or single - hole pulses . for intermediate values of @xmath3",
    "one may have two single - electron or single - hole pulses separated in time .",
    "our model system is a mesoscopic capacitor but our results are equally relevant for different single - electron sources such as those formed with dopant atoms in silicon  @xcite or dots embedded in coplanar cavities  @xcite .",
    "further investigations should address the role of cotunneling processes which are dominant in the coulomb blockade valley at temperatures @xmath177 .",
    "one possibility is to relax the conditions given by eqs .   and   and to make a step further in the equation - of - motion hierarchy .",
    "in particular , spin - flip cotunneling processes would lead to kondo correlations that would alter the picture discussed here .",
    "in general , we expect the minimum between current peaks ( dips ) to rise ( lower ) due to the buildup of a many - body kondo resonance pinned at the fermi energy .",
    "an additional peak should then appear in the quantum capacitance since it is proportional to the local density of states .",
    "however , a new energy scale ( @xmath178 with @xmath179 the kondo temperature ) would arise and a more careful analysis should be carried out .",
    "another assumption of our model is the spin degeneracy in both the dot level and the coupled reservoir [ cf .",
    "introducing a zeeman splitting @xmath13 would lead to extra splittings that would compete with the existing ones depending on the strength of @xmath13 as compared with @xmath102 , @xmath3 and @xmath107 .",
    "we note that the original experiments by fve _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite applied a strong magnetic field that drove the system into the quantum hall regime .",
    "moreover , the dot coupled to a gate with a large capacitance and charging effects were then negligible . to test our predictions , we would need a smaller dot in the absence of magnetic fields ( or with zeeman fields smaller than the characteristic energy scales ) .",
    "finally , we have focused on the adiabatic regime ( low frequencies ) .",
    "this approximation is valid if one is interested in the capacitance and the charge relaxation resistance .",
    "arbitrary frequencies are beyond the scope of the present work but are certainly interesting ( for @xmath72 see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in fact , for larger frequencies ( larger than the ghz scale considered in this work ) photon - assisted tunneling takes place  @xcite and our frequency expansion breaks down . it would be highly desirable to take into account large frequencies and amplitudes in a unified framework for the purely ac transport of electrons in nanostructures .",
