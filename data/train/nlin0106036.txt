    "<S> a novel approach is suggested for the statistical description of quantum systems of interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> the key point of this approach is that a typical eigenstate in the energy representation ( shape of eigenstates , se ) has a well defined classical analog which can be easily obtained from the classical equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the occupation numbers for single - particle states can be represented as a convolution of the classical se with the quantum occupation number operator for non - interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> the latter takes into account the wavefunctions symmetry and depends on the unperturbed energy spectrum only . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of occupation numbers @xmath0 can be numerically found for a very large number of interacting particles . using the model of interacting spins </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this approach gives a correct description of @xmath0 even in a deep quantum region with few single - particle orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> 2    in many physical systems such as complex atoms , heavy nuclei and interacting spins , highly excited eigenstates in the unpertured many - particles basis can be treated as a chaotic superposition of a very large number of components , for a relatively strong interaction among particles ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has been used in @xcite in order to develop a statistical description of closed systems with a finite number of fermi - particles . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it was analytically shown that for a strong enough interaction , a smooth dependence of occupation numbers on the energy occurs , which is related to global properties of chaotic eigenstates .    as is known , the direct numerical computation of excited eigenstates is strongly restricted due to a very large number of many - particles states , which grows extremely fast with the number of particles . however , the mean values of occupation numbers turn out to depend on the average shape of chaotic eigenstates in the unperturbed basis , not on exact , specific values of their components @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we develop a novel approach to quantum systems with chaotic behaviour in the classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> this approach takes into account both the chaotic properties of the classical system , and the specific features of the unperturbed single - particle spectrum . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , one can avoid diagonalization of hamiltonian matrices of a huge size which may be practically unfeasible . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of approach can be applied to generic hamiltonian systems with two - body interaction of the type :    @xmath1    here @xmath2 describes @xmath3 _ non - interacting _ particles with @xmath4 as single - particle hamiltonians , and @xmath5 stands for a long - range two - body interaction between the particles . in what follows , we assume that the single - particle spectrum is determined by a finite number @xmath6 of single - particles energies @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; however , the approach is valid for more generic systems with an infinite spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath2 determines the many - particle states @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 , @xmath11 as creation - annihilation operators ) , that form the basis in which the exact eigenstates of @xmath12 are represented . as usual , we assume that the basis is ordered according to increasing unperturbed energy values @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of occupation numbers ( don ) for single - particle states is defined by the relation , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the occupation number operator giving the occupation numbers @xmath16 equal to @xmath17 or @xmath18 for fermi - particles , and to @xmath19 for bose - particles . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers @xmath20 indicate how many particles in a many - particle _ basis _ state @xmath21 , occupy a particular single - particle state @xmath22 . correspondingly </S>",
    "<S> , the occupation numbers @xmath23 give the probability that one of @xmath3 particles in a many - particle _ exact _ state with the _ total _ energy @xmath24 , occupies a particular single - particle state @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the total number @xmath25 of many - body states equals @xmath26 for fermi and @xmath27 for bose - particles .    </S>",
    "<S> one should note that while in the above expression for the don , the eigenfunctions @xmath28 depend on the total hamiltonian @xmath12 , the term @xmath20 depends on the unperturbed spectrum only . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is crucial for our semiquantal approach . due to the chaotic structure of exact eigenstates </S>",
    "<S> , one can make an average of the don over a small energy window @xmath29 around the fixed value @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this averaging procedure is similar to that used in the conventional statistical mechanics developed for systems with a finite number of particles in contact with a heat bath , or for isolated systems of an _ infinite _ number of _ non - interacting _ particles .    </S>",
    "<S> expression ( [ nqu ] ) for the mean values @xmath23 can be considerably simplified by introducing the so - called _ shape of eigenfunctions _ , se , </S>",
    "<S> ( envelope of eigenstates in energy representation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the se has been studied in details both in the model with random two - body interaction @xcite , and in dynamical models of interacting particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of the average quantity se ( thus neglecting correlations between different components @xmath28 ) represents the key point of our approach .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the unperturbed many - body energy spectrum has an intrinsic degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is typical for spin systems , and is more complicated in comparison with those studied before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below we show how this difficulty can be overcome . </S>",
    "<S> let us redefine the state @xmath30 by means of a indexes pair @xmath31 , where @xmath32 labels the `` unperturbed energy '' @xmath33 of the many - body state , while @xmath34 labels its degeneracy @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> if there are @xmath36 different `` unperturbed '' energies , one can write , @xmath37 , therefore , one has , @xmath38    according to standard definition@xcite , the se is given by : @xmath39 by substituting @xmath40 with @xmath41 as an average over @xmath42 , we obtain an approximate expression for the don in terms of the se , @xmath43 needless to say , if an unperturbed spectrum has no degeneracy , eq.([crus ] ) can be written in a similar way by taking an average over a small window of energy around @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , expression ( [ crus ] ) depends on two terms of different nature . </S>",
    "<S> the first one , @xmath44 , refers to the unperturbed many - particle spectrum and reflects the specific properties of a single - particle spectrum , as well as quantum features related to fermi - dirac or bose - einstein statistics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the second term , @xmath45 , refers to global properties of eigenstates and describes _ interaction _ effects . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the basic idea of our  semiquantal \" approach is to substitute the latter term ( se ) by its classical analog which can be easily found from classical equations of motion .    </S>",
    "<S> classical analogs of the se have been studied in different models , see , for example , @xcite ) . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , one has to derive the distribution @xmath46 for the probability to find the unperturbed energy @xmath47 for @xmath2 , given the conserved total energy @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be obtained by generating many different initial classical configurations on the energy surface @xmath48 or sampling the @xmath49 values generated by one single trajectory onto the energy surface and computing the correspondent distribution of @xmath50 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two procedures have been found to give the same results in the chaotic region@xcite . in order to facilitate the comparison with the quantum se , in our numerical simulations the bin size of @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> equals the energy distance between neighbour values of @xmath33 . in the same way </S>",
    "<S> one can define the classical distribution of occupation numbers , @xmath51 ( see also @xcite ) . for the quantum - classical comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the bin size of @xmath52 is taken to be equal to the spacing between close single - particle energy levels @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that in this semiquantal approach ( sa ) it is possible to study specific systems of , let us say , @xmath53 interacting particles occupying @xmath54 single - particle levels . </S>",
    "<S> surely , one expect this approach to be valid for highly excited chaotic states in a deep semiclassical region . </S>",
    "<S> however , by direct numerical simulations we have found that the sa gives correct results even for energy values close to the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> the model that we have studied , consists of @xmath3 3-d interacting spins placed in a magnetic field @xmath55 directed along the @xmath56-axis . in order to have a proper many - body operator one should require a coupling between _ all spins _ ( not only between neighbors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian thus reads , @xmath57 using the well known relations @xmath58 , one can write , @xmath59 + & \\\\   </S>",
    "<S> + \\frac{1}{4}(j_x - j_y )   \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1 } \\sum\\limits_{j = i+1}^{n } [ s_i^+ s_j^+ + s_i^- s_j^- ] + & \\\\ \\frac{1}{4 } ( j_x+j_y ) \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1 } \\sum\\limits_{j = i+1}^{n } [ s_i^+ s_j^- + s_i^- s_j^+ ] \\label{h00 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in the mean field approximation , we put @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction can be further simplified by the particular choice @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our hamiltonian @xmath62 has the following form , @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{h0}\\ ] ]    for simplicity , the @xmath3 classical constants of motion @xmath64 have been set to 1 , therefore , the only free classical parameters are the total conserved energy @xmath24 and the interaction @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the classical model has been studied in @xcite and it was numerically found to be chaotic and exponentially unstable in a wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in order to have strong chaos , one needs the interaction @xmath65 between particles to be strong enough . </S>",
    "<S> a convenient choice is to take the interaction strength @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> one should stress that this situation is the most difficult for theoretical studies , see discussion in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantization follows the standard rules , which gives , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the action of creation and annihilation operators is defined by : @xmath70    where @xmath71 are the non - symmetrized states ( first quantization states ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath72 single - particle energy levels @xmath73 with @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the unperturbed many - particle energy spectrum consists of a number of degenerate levels with the spacing equal to @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that both the ground state @xmath76 and the upper level @xmath77 are non - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the classical limit is recovered when spins are allowed to have any possible orientation , that is @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> the choice we have done ( @xmath61 ) allows to reduce the dimension of the hilbert space by , approximately , one half . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because the operator @xmath5 in ( [ h0 ] ) connects only those unperturbed many - body states that are separated by the spacing @xmath80 . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the subset of the many - body states containing the ground state . from these states </S>",
    "<S> we construct the completely symmetrized states @xmath81 ) , in the second quantization , can be written as : @xmath82 with @xmath83 here @xmath84 , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 the creation - annihilation operators satisfying the standard relation @xmath87= \\delta_{hk}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> as to the coefficients @xmath88 , @xmath89 , they have quite complicated expressions ; however , they can be easily computed numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure we have used in our numerical simulations consists of the following steps : a ) compute the classical values @xmath90 , and @xmath91 as described above ; b ) compute the quantum values @xmath90 and @xmath91 by diagonalization of the total hamiltonian ( [ cal0 ] ) ; c ) compute @xmath90 and @xmath91 by using the semiquantal approximation according to expression ( [ crus ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the results for the don are summarized in fig.[n4 ] . for the convenience of comparison , symbols refer to the quantum and sa results , while the classical data are presented as hystograms , . </S>",
    "<S> note , that each particle can have energy within the interval @xmath92 $ ] . in order to make the quantum - classical comparison as close as possible </S>",
    "<S> , we took the classical bin size equal to @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> all distributions have been normalized in such a way that @xmath93 . in cases ( </S>",
    "<S> a ) and ( b ) we choose the same energy , close to the ground state and two different @xmath94 values . in ( c ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) instead , we choose a higher energy value . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) should describe a situation more classical than the former ( higher energy should correspond to higher temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that , while classical and quantum data only disagree in the _ deep _ quantum region ( a ) ( energy close to the ground state and small @xmath94 ( _ big _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 ) ) , there is a very nice correspondence between quantum and sa data in all cases ( including region ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this nice correspondence is far from trivial since sa does not take into account quantum correlations inside exact eigenstates , together with possible correlations between the two terms , @xmath95 and @xmath96 in expression ( [ nquan ] ) , both expected to be strong in the deep quantum region .    </S>",
    "<S> it is very interesting to explore the occurence of the bose - einstein ( be ) distribution in our model . </S>",
    "<S> a similar problem has been studied in detail for the model of two - body random interaction @xcite where the conditions for the appearence of fermi - dirac distribution have been found for few interacting fermi - particles .    by assuming , a priori , the validity of the be - distribution @xmath97^{-1}$ ] in our closed system </S>",
    "<S> , one can find the  temperature \" @xmath98 and the  chemical potential \" @xmath99 via the standard relations , @xmath100 here @xmath101 is the numerically computed energy obtained from the single - particle quantum distribution ( see details in @xcite ) , and @xmath3 is the number of particles . notice that , due to interaction , @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between be and sa distributions are shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , even for relatively small @xmath103 , the distribution @xmath90 can be closely approximated by be - distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the expectation that a strong enough interaction between particles can play the role of an internal heat bath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the standard quantum distributions can be used , with a corresponding renormalization of the energy @xmath101 ( see details in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus in our model there is no need to increase further the number of particles , since even for @xmath103 a remarkable agreement with be distribution has been found .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that an exact quantum treatment of the last example calls for a diagonalization of a huge matrix of size @xmath104 , while , with the semiquantal approach , all computations required few minutes on a standard portable pc .    in conclusion , we suggest an effective semiquantal approach to closed systems of interacting particles , based on the chaotic structure of eigenstates . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , the computation of the distribution of occupation numbers can be easily performed by making use of the classical analog of the shape of eigenstates in the unperturbed many - particle basis . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the model of 3-d spins with anisotropic ising interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the data show that semiquantal computations give results which are very close to the exact ones . </S>"
