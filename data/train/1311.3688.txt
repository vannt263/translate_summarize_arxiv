    "preparation and control of p - type conductivity is still a challenge towards fabrication of inn - based photonic devices .",
    "several authors have demonstrated that p - type conductivity in inn can be achieved by introduction of mg as acceptor impurity  @xcite .",
    "it is known however that p - type regions in inn are embedded as buried channels in between high - density electron layers that form on the surface and at the interface between inn and substrate ( or buffer layer ) due to intrinsic defects and elements as oxygen or hydrogen that act as shallow donors  @xcite .",
    "this behavior affects the confirmation of the conductivity type and impedes the characterization of the p - type region by conventional electrical methods like electrical hall - effect or hot probe measurements .",
    "this difficulty is not only attributed to the high sheet charge density on the surface but also to the large difference between electron ( 1000 - 2500@xmath6/vs ) and hole mobility ( 20 - 75@xmath6/vs ) .",
    "electrolyte capacitance - voltage measurement ( ecv ) is commonly applied for the determination of hole concentrations while mobility values are estimated by fitting sheet conductivities from hall - measurements of samples with different thicknesses .",
    "indications for successful p - type doping were only found for mg concentrations of @xmath3@xmath1 to @xmath4@xmath1  @xcite , which is explained by the necessity to overcome a fairly high intrinsic donor concentration caused by lattice defects and residual shallow donors like hydrogen or oxygen  @xcite for low mg concentrations and an increasing defect density for very high mg concentrations .",
    "the influence of the polarity of the buffer layer on growth and physical properties of inn was investigated  @xcite .",
    "these results were confirmed by other groups  @xcite .",
    "we recently demonstrated the ability of infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry ( irse ) to identify the different carrier types and determine the free - charge carrier parameters concentration and mobility in a series of inn samples ( set  a ) with systematically varied mg concentration  @xcite .",
    "irse measurements were followed by a dedicated model dielectric function ( mdf ) line shape analysis which provides access to phonon mode and free charge carrier parameters of the group - iii nitride thin film sample constituents . in combination with additional nir - vis - vuv and optical hall - effect measurements ( generalized ellipsometry with applied external static magnetic field ) , p - type conductivity in the mg concentration range",
    "@xmath3@xmath1@xmath7[mg]@xmath7@xmath8@xmath1 could be concluded from the appearance of a dip structure in the infrared spectral region related to a loss in reflectivity of p - polarized light as a consequence of reduced longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon plasmon ( lpp ) coupling , by vanishing free - charge carrier induced birefringence in the optical hall - effect measurements , by a sudden change in phonon - plasmon broadening behavior despite continuous change in the mg concentration , and a strongly reduced mobility for the p - type samples .",
    "the free - charge carrier concentration and mobility parameters were determined by applying kukharskii s model that accounts for the lpp coupling .",
    "the same approach is applied here to investigate the free - charge carrier parameters in a second sample set ( set  b )  @xcite grown in a different reactor in this sample set , the mg concentrations were chosen in the range for which p - type conductivity was reported earlier  @xcite in order to investigate the critical mg concentrations for transitions between n- and p - type conductivity . in this work , we show that the mg concentration range for p - type conductivity found in sample set  b is consistent with the results reported for sample set  a , i.e. , the doping mechanisms are independent on a particular reactor setup .",
    "the determined free - charge carrier parameters for sample set  b are in excellent agreement with the results reported before for sample set  a  @xcite . in the set",
    "b , two samples with mg concentration of @xmath5@xmath1 are identified as compensated n - type inn with very low electron concentrations by strongly reduced lpp broadening compared to the p - type samples of similar plasma frequencies .",
    "the broadening parameters of the upper and lower lpp branch of the n - type samples in the second sample set follow the expected lpp broadening behavior in dependence of the plasma frequency and prove the expected different broadening behavior for electron and hole phonon - plasmons as pointed out in earlier publication  @xcite .",
    "the results of sample set  a as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are included here for comparison .",
    "for the samples discussed here , the optical axes of the materials constituents , which are optically anisotropic with uniaxial optical properties , is oriented parallel to the surface normal .",
    "therefore , without applying a magnetic field during the measurement , no mode conversion of light polarized parallel ( p ) to polarization perpendicular(s ) to the plane of incidence and vice versa will occur and standard ellipsometry can be applied  @xcite .",
    "the standard ellipsometric parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined by the ratio @xmath11 of the complex valued fresnel reflection coefficients @xmath12    the ellipsometry data was analyzed by using a layer - stack model including the sapphire substrate , the gan template layer  @xcite , the undoped inn buffer layer , and the mg doped bulk inn layer .",
    "the light propagation within the entire sample stack is calculated by applying a @xmath13 matrix algorithm for multilayer systems assuming plane parallel interfaces  @xcite . in order to reduce parameter correlation ,",
    "the measurements are obtained at multiple angles of incidence and analyzed simultaneously . a regression analysis(levenberg - marquardt algorithm )",
    "is performed , where the model parameters are varied until calculated and experimental data match as close as possible  @xcite . the sapphire model dielectric function ( mdf ) , uncoupled phonon mode parameters , and @xmath14 values for gan and inn",
    "were taken from our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of free - charge carriers to the mdf and phonon - plasmon coupling was described by applying kukharskii s model  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the frequencies of the lpp@xmath17/lpp@xmath18 branches and @xmath19 the according lpp broadening parameters .",

    "_ n _ is the free - charge carrier concentration .",
    "the plasma frequency @xmath27 and plasma broadening parameter @xmath20 provide access only to the coupled quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "conclusions about carrier concentration and mobility from the irse measurements are therefore only possible by assuming a value for the effective mass of electrons or holes , respectively .",
    "further , the sign of the charge @xmath31 is not accessible without applying an additional magnetic field during the measurement , i.e. direct determination of the carrier type is not possible from irse .",
    "however , the broadening parameters @xmath19 are independent of the effective mass of the carriers and directly obtained from the model analysis . as discussed in previous publication , holes are expected to reveal much lower mobility and thus higher broadening parameters @xmath19 compared to electrons  @xcite .",
    "thus , a different broadening behavior is expected for p - type conducting samples compared to n - type conducting samples and the lpp broadening parameter can be taken as indicator for a change of the conductivity type  @xcite . in order to achieve the best match between experimental and model data free - charge carrier contributions in the doped bulk inn layer , the gan template layer and the not intentionally doped inn buffer layer were included in the model analysis .",
    "the band structure of inn could so far only be studied theoretically due to the lack of intrinsic inn samples  @xcite .",
    "all unintentionally doped inn samples reported in literature show n - type conductivity .",
    "consequently , burstein - moss effect calculations always need to be applied in order to extract the intrinsic band - gap parameters .",

    "an extrapolated value for the effective electron mass parameter for intrinsic inn of @xmath32 with negligible anisotropy at the @xmath33-point was reported  @xcite .",

    "contributions of electronic interband transitions between the valence bands were not reported for spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on group - iii nitride semiconductors and would be expected to be outside the accessible spectral range due to the small valence band splittings in inn .",
    "two sets of inn films with varying mg concentrations grown on c - plane gan / sapphire templates by molecular beam epitaxy were investigated .",
