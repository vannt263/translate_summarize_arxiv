    "clustering and percolation in continuum systems are concepts of great interest in many areas of physics .",
    "see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . in a many - body disordered system , the central problem in continuum percolation",
    "consists in determining the critical density ( for a given temperature ) at which the system presents a cluster that spans the system volume .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the crucial question of what is a cluster .",
    "the answer to this question is many - sided .",
    "a cluster is a set of particles that can be considered as a unit separated from the rest of the system and that can manifest itself in an experiment . what we define as a cluster in a given system depends on the properties of interest .",
    "therefore , there is a degree of arbitrariness in the cluster definition .",
    "the main premise here is that any proposed definition allows a separation of the system into a number of disjoint sets of particles which is appropriate to describe the phenomenon under study .",
    "for example , if one intends to explain an insulator  conductor transition , and the particles of the system are the conducting objects , we should call cluster to any set of contacting particles that is not in contact with any other particle in the system @xcite . a good example",
    "is also found in deposited granular matter where clusters correspond to mutually stabilizing sets of particles called arches @xcite .",
    "the first physically sound cluster definition for a simple fluid was given by hill @xcite by contrast with the mathematical clusters introduced by mayer @xcite . in hill s",
    "theory , the concept of cluster is directly related to the idea of _ bonded pairs_. a bonded pair is a set of two particles that are linked by some direct mechanism . then , a cluster is defined as a set of particles such that any pair of particles in the set is connected through a path of bonded pairs .",
    "the definition of bonded pair becomes then the essential part of the theory and a number of definitions have been used . among others",
    ", we can mention the energetic criterion and the geometric criterion for bonded pairs proposed by hill himself @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "two particles are considered bonded at a given time if the negative of the pair potential energy is higher than the relative kinetic energy of the pair ( see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . in the second case ,",
    "two particles are bonded at a given time if they are within a distance @xmath1 .",
    "these later geometrical clusters are referred to as stillinger s clusters ( see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have introduced a new definition of cluster based on hill s theory where the bonded pairs are defined as particles that remain within a certain distance @xmath1 during a time interval @xmath0 .",
    "we call these clusters _ chemical clusters _  since the stability requirement on each connection remind us of a covalent bond .",
    "note that a very similar dynamic definition was advanced previously by bahadur and mcclurg @xcite . in the same paper",
    ", we have also presented a different approach to cluster identification where the concept of bonded pairs is meaningless . in this case , we identify as a cluster any set of particles that remain interconnected ( in the stillinger s sense ) at every instant over a time interval @xmath0 . each particle within a given cluster may move around without forming a stable bond with any other particle whereas it stays connected to the group .",
    "we have termed these later clusters _ physical clusters _ for they exist without the presence of specific particle  particle bonds .    some preliminary studies of the properties of chemical and physical clusters in lennard  jones systems where presented in ref .",
    "moreover , an integral equation theory was presented there and later on successfully used @xcite to calculate the cluster pair correlation function for chemical clusters .",
    "also , a first theoretical attempt to treat the case of physical clusters was advanced in ref . @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of an exhaustive investigation of the percolation of chemical clusters for a variety of values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have encountered that chemical clusters percolate at progressively higher densities as @xmath0 grows from zero . beyond a moderate value of @xmath0 , the percolation line coincides with the low - density branch of the liquid  solid coexistence curve .",
    "this represents , to our knowledge , the first application of continuum percolation where the percolation line coincides to such degree with a coexistence line of a simple fluid .",
    "we also show that the percolation line for physical clusters , although it moves towards higher densities as @xmath0 grows , reaches a maximum density within the fluid phase beyond which the system percolates irrespective of how large is @xmath0 . from these findings , we conclude that stable chemical clusters can not exist in a simple fluid although physical cluster do exist at relatively high densities .",
    "we also point out that transient chemical clusters ( by contrast with stable clusters ) may help to explain differences in experiments carried out on the same system when probing different timescales .",
    "in a many - body system , two particles at time @xmath2 are considered to form a _ bonded pair _ ( in the stillinger s sense ) of proximity @xmath1 , if they are within a distance @xmath1 from each other at time @xmath2 .",
    "then , a set of particles at time @xmath2 is called a _ stillinger s",
    "cluster _ of proximity @xmath1 , if every particle in the set is connected through a path of pair - bonded particles and no other particle in the system is bonded to any of them .",
    "this cluster definition is a basic standpoint for the following more realistic definitions .",
    "two particles at time @xmath2 are considered to form a _ bonded pair _ of lifespan @xmath0 and proximity @xmath1 , if they were within a distance @xmath1 from each other over the entire time interval @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "then , a set of particles at time @xmath2 is called a _ chemical cluster _ of lifespan @xmath0 and proximity @xmath1 , if every particle in the set is connected through a path of pair - bonded particles and no other particle in the system is bonded to any of them . a chemical cluster with lifespan @xmath4",
    "is called a _ stable _ chemical cluster . here",
    ", @xmath5 means any time long enough for the cluster to be detected by an experimental setup .",
    "a chemical cluster of lifespan @xmath6 and proximity @xmath1 corresponds to a stillinger s cluster of proximity @xmath1 .",
    "we would not normally expect to find stable chemical clusters in a simple fluid since particles do not tend to form stable particle  particle bonds .",
    "however , if we use an experimental technique able to resolve short times , we might be able to detect the presence of ephemeral ( small @xmath0 ) chemical clusters .",
    "moreover , if interactions are significantly stronger and dynamics significantly slower , as is the case in colloidal systems , most experiments are able to detect the existence of chemical clusters ( see for example the relation between percolation of chemical clusters and the sol - gel transition @xcite ) . of course , chemical clusters are easily detected in true chemical bonding ( _ e.g. _ polymerisation ) and in strongly interacting molecules ( _ e.g. _ hydrogen bonding @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that we identify a given set of particles at time @xmath7 as a stillinger s cluster of proximity @xmath1 .",
    "we then focus on this set of particles alone . as the system evolves in time , the particles of this stillinger s",
    "cluster approach other particles in the system , which we will disregard in our analysis . eventually , the original stillinger s cluster fragments into two or more disconnected subclusters  in the stillinger s sense . each of these subclusters can be now considered individually , disregarding the remaining particles in the system",
    " even those that were part of the parent cluster and now belong to a different subcluster .",
    "again , during the evolution , each subcluster may fragment .",
    "if we continue this analysis systematically until time @xmath2 is reached ( _ i.e. _ over a period of time @xmath0 ) , each final subcluster , which is a product of numerous fragmentation events , is called a _ physical cluster _ of lifespan @xmath0 and proximity @xmath1 . a physical cluster with lifespan @xmath4",
    "is called a _",
    "stable _ physical cluster .",
    "again , @xmath5 represents a time long enough for the cluster to be detected by an experimental setup .",
    "a physical cluster of lifespan @xmath6 and proximity @xmath8 corresponds to a stillinger s cluster of proximity @xmath1 .",
    "we expect to find stable physical clusters in a simple fluid .",
    "in fact , any sample of liquid should correspond to a single physical cluster .",
    "the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation technique used to identify both chemical and physical clusters was introduced and described in ref .",
    "this technique is a slight modification of a standard @xmath9 md simulation @xcite where bonded pairs ( for chemical cluster ) and entire stillinger s clusters ( for physical clusters ) are tracked down along a time interval of length @xmath0 .",
    "we report results for a lennard  jones system , _",
    "i.e. _ particles that interact through@xmath10   .\\label{e1}%\\ ] ] quantities are then expressed in lennard  jones reduced units in the rest of the paper : @xmath11 for length , @xmath12 for time , and @xmath13 for energy .",
    "quantities in reduced units are indicated with an asterisk    the results that we present in the following section are based on a leapfrog md simulation of @xmath14 particles in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions . a cut off distance equal to @xmath15 was used in the lennard ",
    "jones pair potential .",
    "we have set the proximity value to @xmath16 .",
    "this value was chosen because it corresponds roughly to the maximum distance at which two lennard  jones particles attract most strongly .",
    "besides , at @xmath17 lies the boundary between the first and the second neighbour shell in the supercooled liquid state @xcite .",
    "this can be considered the maximum distance for which a particle should be considered directly connected from a geometrical point of view .    in most cases ,",
    "quantities are averaged over @xmath18 configurations generated after stabilization .",
    "a few simulations performed with 4000 particles yielded results indistinguishable from those obtained with the 500-particle - system .",
    "a system is said to be in a percolated state if a cluster that spans the periodic replicas is present 50 percent of the time @xcite .",
    "then , a percolation transition curve ( the percolation loci ) , which separates the percolated and the non - percolated states of the system , can be drawn above the gas ",
    "liquid coexistence curve in the @xmath19 phase diagram .     and lifespan @xmath20 0 ( circles ) , 0.5 ( pentagons ) , 1.0 ( squares ) , 5.0 ( diamonds ) , 8.0 ( down triangles ) , and 10.0 ( up triangles ) . ]",
    "in fig . [ figure1 ] we show the phase diagram of the lennard  jones fluid in the @xmath19 plane . the gas ",
    "liquid coexistence curve corresponds to the gibbs ensemble monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results from panagiotopoulos @xcite and the liquid ",
    "solid coexistence line corresponds to the mc calculations of hansen and verlet @xcite .",
    "the percolation line for chemical clusters of proximity @xmath17 and lifespan @xmath21 and @xmath22 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the special case with @xmath23 corresponds to _ instantaneous _ stillinger s clusters .",
    "as we can see , the percolation line shifts towards high values of @xmath24 as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this is to be expected in a simple liquid because , for a given temperature , the density needs to be increased in order to promote caging and so extend the lifespan of particle",
    " particle bonds .     and lifespan @xmath20 0 ( circles ) , 1 ( pentagons ) , 5 ( squares ) , 10 ( diamonds ) , 100 ( down triangles ) , 1000 ( up triangles )",
    ". the solid vertical line corresponds to the critical density @xmath25  ( see text ) . ]",
    "interestingly , for @xmath26 we find that the percolation line coincides with the liquid branch of the liquid  solid transition curve . rigorously speaking , if @xmath27 , any state of the system to the left of the liquid ",
    "solid coexistence line is non - percolated whereas any state in the solid side of the phase diagram is percolated .",
    "the reason for this resides in the fact that simple liquids have to make a transition to a crystalline state in order to generate long - lasting particle",
    " particle bonds . in a crystalline state",
    "the neighbours of each particle remain the same for extremely long periods of time . of course",
    ", a similar effect can be achieved in a glassy state , but we are only concerned with equilibrium states here . from this result",
    "we can say that stable ( @xmath4 ) chemical cluster do not exist in the fluid phase of a simple liquid .",
    "it is worth mentioning that using different values of @xmath1 ( at least in the range @xmath28 @xmath29 ) shifts all the percolation curves but they still converge to the liquid ",
    "solid transition line for large @xmath0 .",
    "larger values of @xmath1 requires larger values of @xmath0 to achieve convergence .    our findings on the properties of the chemical cluster percolation line for large @xmath0 suggests that we could use this analysis to predict the liquid ",
    "solid transition line using a relatively simple simulation technique and the appropriate cluster identification criterion .",
    "previously , much effort have been made to find a match between percolation and the gas  liquid transition , especially in the two - state magnetic lattice model of a fluid @xcite .",
    "this studies have been unsuccessful so far , which can be appreciated in the type of device ( ghost spin ) needed to prevent inconsistencies in the theory @xcite .",
    "as we can see , chemical clusters are a more realistic definition of clusters and shows that the percolation line should describe the liquid ",
    "solid transition rather than the gas  liquid transition . whether there exists a suitable definition of cluster that yields a match between percolation and gas  liquid transition",
    "is still unresolved .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", the percolation behaviour of physical clusters is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "in contrast with chemical clusters , physical clusters percolate at moderate densities ( far from the liquid ",
    "solid transition ) even at very large values of @xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in fact , the percolation curve seems to converge to a limiting line beyond which the system is always percolated no matter how large is @xmath0 .",
    "this suggest that there exist a critical density @xmath25 ( @xmath31 ) in the supercritical phase above which physical clusters percolates irrespective of the temperature and the required lifespan @xcite .",
    "this line is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , and it can be thought of as a dividing line between a gas - like phase ( to the left of @xmath25 ) and a liquid - like phase ( to the right of @xmath25 ) . within the gas - like phase ,",
    "physical clusters percolate only at finite lifespan . in the liquid - like phase physical clusters",
    "always percolate the system . within the liquid - like phase except in a small neighbourhood around @xmath25 nearly all particles in the system remain interconnected in a single large physical cluster , _",
    "i.e. _ , no fragmentation takes places within any finite time interval .",
    "the main objection we have to this separation into liquid - like and gas - like regions of the supercritical phase is that states that we would normally assign to a liquid reside in the gas - like side of the phase diagram .",
    "the density @xmath25 is certainly higher than the thermodynamic critical density @xmath32 .",
    "all the states comprised between the gas ",
    "liquid coexistence curve , the vertical line that passes through @xmath25 and the horizontal line that passes through @xmath33 ( the thermodynamic critical temperature ) are in a liquid state . according to our physical cluster properties , however , they should be in a gas - like state .",
    "interestingly , a different separation of the supercritical phase proposed by fisher and widom @xcite does also meet the gas  liquid coexistence line at a density above @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , the fisher  widom line does not coincide with the dividing line we present here .",
    "in this work , we have shown that chemical clusters and physical clusters defined in ref . @xcite",
    "have very different behaviour at large lifespan .",
    "in particular , chemical clusters present a percolation curve that coincides with the low - density branch of the liquid  solid transition curve for any @xmath0 beyond a moderate value .",
    "physical clusters , in contrast , present a percolation curve that converges to a vertical line in the @xmath19 plane located at moderate densities when @xmath0 tends to infinity .    the percolation properties of chemical clusters suggest that we can predict the liquid  solid transition in a simple fluid by calculating the percolation line at moderate lifespan values . an integral equation theory for chemical clusters has been developed previously @xcite .",
    "moreover , a numerical technique has been used recently @xcite  to solve the equations , but only at small values of @xmath0 .",
    "this technique may allow us to predict the position of the liquid ",
    "solid coexistence line without the need of free energy calculations by setting @xmath0 to larger values ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that is not possible to find stable ( long lifespan ) chemical clusters in the fluid phase of a simple fluid .",
    "as soon as we exceed a moderate value of @xmath0 we require the system to crystallise in order to find chemical clusters of lifespan @xmath0 .",
    "this finding seems rather intuitive ; however , until now , percolation models where not consistent with this picture .    for small values of @xmath0",
    ", we find a family of percolation curves for chemical clusters ranging from the classical instantaneous ( stillinger s ) cluster percolation up to the liquid  solid transition .",
    "each of these percolations curves may be observable as viscoelastic sol  gel - like transitions measured at different shear frequencies @xcite .",
    "indeed , working at very high shear frequencies will result in a sol ",
    "gel transition line at relatively low densities .",
    "high frequencies probe short timescales and any ephemeral ( small @xmath0 ) stress - bearing percolating cluster will develop a dominating elastic response in the system .",
    "conversely , working at very low frequencies will result in a sol ",
    "gel transition line at relatively high densities .",
    "low frequencies probe long timescales and the particle ",
    "particle bonds have to last long enough ( large @xmath0 ) for any percolating cluster to develop a dominating elastic response ."
