    "in 2014 costantino , geer and patureau introduced a new class of non - semisimple witten - reshetikhin - turaev type quantum invariants of closed 3-manifolds .",
    "the theory is indexed on some rather complicated algebraic structures : if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are abelian groups called the _ structure group _ and the _ periodicity group _ respectively and if @xmath3 is a `` small '' subset of @xmath1 called the _",
    "critical set _ then a very general construction provides an invariant of decorated closed 3-manifolds for every _ pre - modular @xmath1-category @xmath4 relative to @xmath5 _ which satisfies some non - degeneracy condition .",
    "such relative pre - modular categories , introduced here in definition [ relative_pre - modular_graded_categories_def ] , are ribbon categories with three important new features : they carry a @xmath1-structure , they have finiteness properties only up to the action of @xmath2 and , more importantly , they are not necessarily semisimple , with the deviation from semisimplicity being measured by @xmath6 .",
    "the costantino - geer - patureau invariants have to be evaluated against closed 3-manifolds @xmath7 equipped with @xmath4-colored ribbon graphs @xmath8 and cohomology classes @xmath9 with @xmath1-coefficients , but not arbitrary ones : @xmath8 and @xmath9 should satisfy a certain compatibility condition and , more importantly , a certain admissibility condition and [ admissibility ] ] , the lack of which makes it impossible to even lay down the definition .",
    "the construction extends the multivariable alexander polynomial , the kashaev invariant and the akutsu - deguchi - othsuki invariant to framed colored links in arbitrary 3-manifolds . a small survey of these results is provided by @xcite .",
    "in @xcite blanchet , costantino , geer and patureau extended these quantum invariants to @xmath10-graded tqfts in the case of a non - degenerate relative pre - modular category @xmath11 of finite - dimensional complex - weight representations of the so called _ unrolled _ version of quantum @xmath0 at a root of unity .",
    "this category features @xmath12 as its structure group with critical set @xmath13 , and the periodicity group @xmath14 appears as the grading group for vector spaces .",
    "when the order of @xmath15 is a multiple of 4 then the braiding on @xmath10-graded vector spaces is the super - symmetric one .",
    "the representations for mapping class groups of surfaces issued from these graded tqfts feature some new interesting phenomena , as the actions of dehn twists along separating curves have infinite order .",
    "it seems however reasonable that the construction should generalize to a larger class of non - degenerate relative pre - modular categories .",
    "this brings us to the goal of the present paper : we want to find conditions for a non - degenerate pre - modular @xmath1-category @xmath4 relative to @xmath5 under which its associated costantino - geer - patureau quantum invariant can be extended to a @xmath2-graded etqft .",
    "moreover , since we are inspired by the construction provided in @xcite , we also want our result to agree with the @xmath10-graded tqfts defined for @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that the only additional requirement we have to make for @xmath4 in order to carry out the whole plan is actually fairly simple : we call it _ relative modularity _ , and it takes the form of a non - degeneracy condition , which is given here in definition [ relative_modular_graded_categories_def ] , that is just slightly stronger than the one we need in order to define costantino - geer - patureau invariants . since in particular this property is established for @xmath16 in lemma a.4 of @xcite , our construction extends the blanchet - costantino - geer - patureau @xmath10-graded tqfts down to 1-dimensional manifolds .",
    "our etqfts will then be symmetric monoidal functors defined on symmetric monoidal 2-categories @xmath17 of decorated cobordisms satisfying some admissibility conditions , and taking values in symmetric monoidal 2-categories @xmath18 of complete @xmath2-graded linear categories .",
    "we state here our main result .",
    "[ main ] if @xmath4 is a modular @xmath1-category relative to @xmath5 then @xmath19 extends to a @xmath2-graded etqft @xmath20    the functor @xmath21 can actually be described in terms of the relative modular category @xmath4 which is used as a building block : connected objects of @xmath17 are mapped to complete @xmath2-graded linear categories which are @xmath2-graded extensions of homogeneous subcategories of projective objects of @xmath4 , and arbitrary objects are mapped to tensor products of these categories .",
    "furthermore , generating 1-morphisms of @xmath17 can be translated into @xmath2-graded linear functors between these @xmath2-graded linear categories , and they can be interpreted as algebraic structures on them . this description presents us immediately with a new phenomenon : the functor @xmath21 is fully monoidal , but the images of certain objects of the domain 2-category are in general non - semisimple .",
    "this result , which apparently contradicts theorem 3 of @xcite , can in fact be explained as follows : in the definition of the admissible cobordism 2-category @xmath17 we forbid some non - admissible decorated cobordisms by removing them from the categories of morphisms .",
    "this makes some `` critical '' objects into non - dualizable ones , thus making room for non - semisimplicity .",
    "we claimed that the symmetric monoidal functor of 2-categories @xmath21 extends @xmath19 , but what does this mean ?",
    "the idea comes from the analogy with the following well - known property : every 3-dimensional tqft yields a quantum invariant of closed 3-dimensional manifolds . here is a recipe to read it off directly .",
    "a closed 3-dimensional manifold can be interpreted in a unique way as a cobordism between two copies of the empty surface .",
    "therefore a tqft associates with it a linear endomorphism of a certain vector space which , as a consequence of monoidality , is isomorphic to @xmath22 , the unit for the tensor product on vector spaces .",
    "such a map is just a product with some fixed complex number .",
    "since morphisms of a cobordism category are given by isomorphism classes of cobordisms , this complex number actually depends only on the diffeomorphism class of the closed 3-manifold , so we can intepret it as a quantum invariant . to compute it ,",
    "it is sufficient to evaluate the linear endomorphism against a generator of the vector space associated with the empty surface .",
    "the situation directly generalizes to the level of 2-categories , so that every 3-dimensional etqft yields a 3-dimensional tqft .",
    "the procedure to recover it is completely analogous .",
    "a closed surface can be interpreted in a unique way as a cobordism between two copies of the empty 1-dimensional manifold .",
    "therefore a tqft associates with it a linear endofunctor of a certain linear category which , as a consequence of monoidality , is equivalent to @xmath23 , which is in turn equivalent to the unit for the complete tensor product of complete linear categories .",
    "such a functor is , up to equivalence of categories , just a tensor product with some fixed vector space , which we can interpret as a tqft vector space . to compute it",
    ", it is sufficient to choose a specified linear equivalence of categories , to translate the linear functor associated with the closed surface into a linear endofunctor of @xmath23 and to evaluate it against the 1-dimensional vector space @xmath22 , which is a generator under direct sum .",
    "everything we said extends word by word to the @xmath2-graded case : every 3-dimensional @xmath2-graded tqft yields a quantum invariant of closed 3-dimensional manifolds and every 3-dimensional @xmath2-graded etqft yields a 3-dimensional @xmath2-graded tqft .",
    "in particular , hidden behind the higher structure of the symmetric monoidal functor @xmath21 , we still have a recipe which associates a complex number with every admissible decorated closed 3-manifold and a @xmath2-graded vector space with every admissible decorated closed surface .",
    "this recovers the quantum invariants of @xcite and generalizes the tqfts of @xcite to all relative modular categories .",
    "the definition of the witten - reshetikhin - turaev quantum invariants of 3-manifolds contained in @xcite made use of surgery presentations which where colored with finite dimensional representations of the restricted version of quantum @xmath0 at a root of unity .",
    "a famous result by turaev which first appeared in @xcite generalized this construction by characterizing its building blocks : non - degenerate pre - modular categories .",
    "this allowed him to associate with every such category @xmath4 a quantum invariant . ]",
    "@xmath24 of decorated closed 3-manifolds , where this time surgery presentations are colored with objects of the indexing category rather than representations of quantum @xmath0 .",
    "it has been known for some time that these quantum invariants can be extended etqfts every time the category @xmath4 is modular .",
    "one possible way to construct these semisimple etqfts is to plug @xmath24 into a machinery called the _ extended universal construction _",
    ", which is derived from @xcite , to obtain a functor of 2-categories @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a symmetric monidal 2-category of @xmath4-decorated cobordisms of topmost dimension 3 , @xmath27 is the symmetric monoidal 2-category of complete linear categories and @xmath28 is a functor called the _ covariant extended quantization functor associated with @xmath24_. it can then be shown that @xmath28 is symmetric monoidal if , and in fact only if , @xmath4 is modular .",
    "the idea of this paper is to try and adapt the same procedure to the non - semisimple setting of costantino , geer and patureau .",
    "their construction , which again is based on surgery presentations , provides a quantum invariant . ]",
    "@xmath19 of admissible decorated closed 3-manifolds for every non - degenerate pre - modular @xmath1-category @xmath4 relative to @xmath5 . by means of the extended universal construction",
    "we can extend @xmath19 to a functor of 2-categories @xmath29 however , unlike in the semisimple case , @xmath28 is not an etqft on the nose , and its deviation from monoidality can be parametrized using the periodicity group @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , we can define a @xmath2-graded extension @xmath30 of @xmath28 with target the symmetric monoidal 2-category of complete @xmath2-graded linear categories .",
    "the idea is to replace the image of an object of @xmath17 under @xmath28 , which is a complete linear category , with a suitably defined complete @xmath2-graded linear category which integrates the obstruction to monoidality into its structure .",
    "we can then show that the resulting functor @xmath21 is indeed symmetric monoidal , and thus provides a @xmath2-graded etqft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin by introducing the main ingredients of our construction , with relative modular categories being defined in section [ relative_modular_graded_categories ] and admissible cobordisms being defined in section [ admissible_decorated_cobordisms ] . in sections from [ seventh_section_graded ] to [ graded_morita_reduction ] we state surgery axioms and we derive their consequences on the extended quantization functors obtained via the extended universal construction , much in the spirit of @xcite . in section [ gradation_section ]",
    "we prove the failure of @xmath28 to be an etqft , we carefully analyse its deviation from monoidality and we define the @xmath2-graded extended quantization functors @xmath21 and @xmath31 . our main results are contained in sections [ monoidality_section ] and [ simmetry_section ] , where we show that @xmath21 is indeed a @xmath2-graded etqft .",
    "sections [ image_of_objects_section ] and [ image_of_1-morphisms_section ] are devoted to a description of the image of @xmath21 in terms of the corresponding relative modular category @xmath4 .",
    "appendix [ cobordisms ] and appendix [ ribbon_graphs ] fix the notation we use for cobordisms and ribbon graphs , appendix [ linear_categories ] and appendix [ graded_linear_categories ] contain definitions and properties of complete linear categories and of complete @xmath2-graded linear categories and appendix [ extended_universal_construction ] contains the details for the extended universal construction .",
    "this section is devoted to the definition of the algebraic structures which are going to play the leading role in the construction .",
    "they are a non - semisimple analogue of modular categories and , since their definition involves a lot of different ingredients , we first set the ground by recalling classical concepts like ribbon categories , group structures , colored ribbon graphs , traces on ideals and ambidextrous objects .",
    "let us begin by recalling the very basic notions for the whole construction .",
