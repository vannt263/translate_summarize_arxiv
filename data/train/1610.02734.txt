    "see @xcite for the original definition in the one - dimensional case . a wandering domain @xmath8",
    "is called _ contracting _ if the diameter of @xmath10 converges to zero as @xmath11 . in the early 20th century , bohl @xcite and denjoy @xcite constructed examples of @xmath0 diffeomorphisms on a circle which have contracting wandering domains in which the union of the @xmath7-limit sets of points is a cantor set . following these results ,",
    "similar phenomena were observed for high dimensional examples , see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of wandering domains is the key of classification of one - dimensional unimodal as well as one - dimensional multimodal maps , in real analytic category , which were developed in @xcite , see the survey of van  strien @xcite .",

    "topics about the existence of non - trivial wandering domains in nonhyperbolic dynamics were first studied by colli - vargas @xcite for some two - dimensional example which is made up of an affine thick horseshoe with @xmath13-persistent homoclinic tangencies . moreover , their conjecture was recently proved to be true by the first and third authors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem a ) : any two - dimensional diffeomorphism in any newhouse open set is contained in the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) closure of diffeomorphisms having contracting non - trivial wandering domains for which the union of the @xmath7-limit sets of points contains a non - trivial basic set .",
    "this result moreover implies an answer in the @xmath14 category to one of the open problems of van strien @xcite which is concerned with the existence of wandering domains for the hnon family , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "there is another well - studied nonhyperbolic phenomenon different from a homoclinic tangency , which is called a heterodimensional cycle .",

    "thus a natural question is the following :    let @xmath1 be a diffeomorphism having a heterodimensional cycle .",
    "is the diffeomorphism @xmath1 contained in the @xmath14 closure of diffeomorphisms having contracting non - trivial wandering domains ?",
    "the next theorem is one of the main results in the present paper , which gives corollary [ co1 ] as an affirmative answer to this question .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath1 be a diffeomorphism on a three - dimensional manifold which has a heterodimensional cycle associated with two saddle periodic points at which both the derivatives for @xmath1 have non - real eigenvalues .",

    "the tatjer condition consists of some topological requirements for the tangency given in ( [ c1])([c3 ] ) in section [ sec3 ] .",
