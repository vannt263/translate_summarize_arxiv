    "interacting particle systems are mathematical models used to study collective properties of n - body systems evolving with time @xcite .",
    "replacing the actual evolution rules ( given by a classical or a quantum hamiltonian ) by a stochastic dynamics leads one to formulate many properties of the system in terms of probability theory and allows the use of powerful mathematical methods @xcite .",
    "hence , universal properties of nonequilibrium statistical physics are successfully explored through the investigation of stochastic processes , that are governed by simple dynamical rules at the microscopic level but that display a rich macroscopic behavior @xcite .",
    "when defining such models , some specific features of the original physical problem have to be discarded , but if the relevant and fundamental characteristics are retained ( such as symmetry properties and conservation laws ) it is expected that the large scale and large time behavior of the system will be described correctly @xcite .",
    "building a simple representation for complex phenomena is common procedure in statistical physics , leading to the emergence of paradigmatic models : the harmonic oscillator , the random walker , the ising magnet and so on .",
    "these `` beautiful models '' often display wonderful mathematical structures @xcite .    in the field of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ,",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) has reached the status of a paradigm @xcite .",
    "the asep is a lattice - gas model of interacting particles .",
    "each of these particles is a random walker that hops from a site to one of the neighboring locations , but a move is allowed only if the target site is empty .",
    "this exclusion constraint mimics short - range interactions amongst particles . in order to drive this lattice gas out of equilibrium ,",
    "non - vanishing currents have to be established in the system and this can be achieved by various means : by starting with a non - uniform initial condition that takes an infinite amount of time to relax , by coupling the system to external reservoirs that drive currents through the system ( transport of particles , energy , heat , etc . ) or by introducing some intrinsic bias in the dynamics that favors motion in a privileged direction , each particle being an asymmetric random walker that drifts steadily along the direction of an external driving force .",
    "in particular , the case where moves are allowed in only one direction is said totally asymmetric ( tasep ) .",
    "the asep has been invented several times and in different contexts due to its simplicity .",
    "it was probably first proposed as a prototype to describe the dynamics of ribosomes along rna @xcite . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "brownian motions with hard - core interactions were first studied by spitzer @xcite who coined the name _",
    "exclusion process_. the asep also appeared naturally in the description of transport processes in systems with strong geometric constraints such as macromolecules transiting through capillary vessels and that can not overtake each other @xcite , or anisotropic conductors known as solid electrolytes where electrons hop from a vacant location to another and repel each other via coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "popular modern applications of the exclusion process include molecular motors that transport proteins within the cells along actin filaments @xcite and , last but not least , the asep and its variants are ubiquitous in discrete models of traffic flow @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view , the asep is one of the simplest but nontrivial models for which the hydrodynamic limit can be rigorously proved . at large scales ,",
    "the distribution of the particles of the asep emerges as a density field that evolves according to the burgers equation with a vanishingly small viscosity @xcite .",
    "the burgers equation is the textbook prototype for shock formation : a smooth initial distribution can develop a singularity ( a discontinuity ) in finite time .",
    "a natural question that arises is whether this shock is an artifact of the hydrodynamic limit or if , under some specific conditions , the original asep does display some singularity at the microscopic scale @xcite .",
    "this question was answered positively @xcite : a shock does exist at the level of the particle system and its width is of the order of the lattice size . however , defining precisely the position of the shock at the microscopic level requires a trick which is achieved by introducing a new type of particle called a _ second - class particle _ , which amounts to coupling two tasep models which initially differ at a single location @xcite .",
    "this second - class particle , denoted by 2 , has the same dynamics as a normal ( or first - class ) particle , denoted by 1 , but first - class particles treat it as a hole ( denoted by 0 ) . the local dynamical rules thus take the following simple form : @xmath6 where all transitions occur with a same rate .",
    "it was proved rigorously in @xcite that the dynamics of the unique second - class particle mimics the motion of the shock in an infinite system .",
    "alternatively , by considering a finite density of second - class particles in a periodic system , the shape of the microscopic fronts were exactly calculated @xcite .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the two species case of first- and second - class particles is to the multispecies exclusion process where there is a hierarchy amongst @xmath4 different species ( or classes ) of particles @xcite ( @xmath4-asep ) : a particle of class @xmath0 views particles of classes @xmath7 as holes and is viewed as a hole by particles of classes @xmath8 ; in other words , `` higher '' classes have lower overtaking priority , as will be defined precisely in the next section .",
    "the stationary state of this simplest multispecies generalization of the asep is highly nontrivial : it was first constructed by pablo ferrari and james martin @xcite in the tasep case through a mapping to queueing processes .",
    "their construction was inspired by earlier combinatorial results @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the ferrari - martin algorithm was re - expressed as a matrix product representation in which the weight of a configuration in the @xmath4-asep is written as a linear combination of weights of configurations of the @xmath5-asep .",
    "this matrix ( product ) ansatz hence allows one to derive steady - state properties of a given model knowing those of a _",
    "simpler system_.    more general spectral properties of the multispecies asep on a ring were investigated in @xcite where models with different total number of species were related to each other in a different manner . in that work ,",
    "the key observation was that particles of two consecutive classes can not be distinguished by particles of other classes .",
    "thus , identifying two consecutive classes @xmath9 and @xmath10 defines a natural projection from the @xmath4-asep onto the @xmath5-asep . because one can identify any two consecutive classes of particles , there are @xmath4 different such projections .",
    "these mappings together with their commutation relations endow the set of all possible models with a poset structure represented by a hasse diagram @xcite .",
    "the existence of this structure leads to canonical inclusion relations and duality in the spectrum of the markov matrix .",
    "in particular , through the identification mapping , the eigenvectors of the @xmath4-asep either vanish or project onto eigenvectors of the @xmath5-asep . however , these projections blur some essential information ( namely , the difference between the two consecutive classes @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) that can not be retrieved easily . in particular , they do not allow one to build the eigenvectors of a model knowing those of a simpler system .",
    "the above descriptions of the matrix ansatz and of the identification maps indicate that they operate in reverse directions and , hence , that they should be related .",
    "this also suggests that the matrix ansatz may have a range of applicability that exceeds stationary - state properties ; the matrix ansatz should be useful also to build `` excited states '' of the @xmath4-asep knowing those of the @xmath5-asep . in this perspective",
    ", the matrix ansatz could be viewed as a ` lifting procedure ' from the @xmath5-asep to the @xmath4-asep that creates a new species of particles by separating a given class into two consecutive subclasses .",
    "further , we have seen that there are @xmath4 different choices for the identification maps from the @xmath4-asep to the @xmath5-asep .",
    "are there also @xmath4 different matrix product representations that would correspond to splitting a species @xmath9 into two consecutive classes @xmath9 and @xmath10 ?",
    "could there be @xmath4 different generalizations of the ferrari - martin algorithm ?",
    "the objective of the present work is to answer these questions in the tasep case by reformulating them in the appropriate mathematical framework and stating them in rigorous terms .",
    "we will introduce a generalized matrix ansatz which constructs a lifting operator from the @xmath5-tasep to the @xmath4-tasep .",
    "this will provide with a new and much broader perspective about this technique and shed light on the recursive structures that underlie the @xmath4-tasep dynamics . as a result , the problems stated above will be solved and families of quadratic algebras that encode these recursions will be constructed .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section  [ model ] , we define the dynamical rules of the @xmath4-asep , describe the characteristics and some spectral properties of the markov matrix , define identification operators between different systems ( sectors ) and formulate the fundamental problem addressed here . from section  [ measure ] onwards , we restrict our consideration to the tasep case , unless explicitly stated otherwise . in section  [ measure ] , we recall the ferrari - martin algorithm of the stationary state of the @xmath4-tasep and describe the associated matrix product representation .",
    "the main results are derived in section  [ mainsection ] : we construct a set of generalized matrix ansatz and we prove that this allows us to define a family of conjugation operators from the @xmath5-tasep to the @xmath4-tasep ; each of these matrix ansatz leads to a different quadratic algebra and we find explicit representations for all these algebras ; finally , we find a generalized ferrari - martin algorithm corresponding to each algebra .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the appendices contains examples and technical details .",
    "the @xmath4-asep on the ring @xmath11 with @xmath12 sites is defined by the following dynamical rules .",
    "each site @xmath13 , is assigned with a variable ( local state ) @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce a stochastic process such that nearest neighbor pairs of local states @xmath15 are interchanged with the following transition rates : @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 being real nonnegative parameters , with the choice @xmath19 without loss of generality .",
    "we have to replace @xmath20 or reverse the variables @xmath21 , if we wish to compare the present work with @xcite . ] in particular , for @xmath22 the model is totally asymmetric and is called the @xmath4-tasep ; for @xmath23 , the model is said partially asymmetric ( @xmath4-pasep ) ; @xmath24 is the symmetric case ( @xmath4-ssep ) .",
    "the dynamics is formulated in terms of the continuous - time master equation for the probability @xmath25 of finding a configuration @xmath26 at time @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a step function defined as @xmath30    this model can be regarded as an interacting multispecies particle system by interpreting the local state @xmath31 as representing the site @xmath32 occupied by a particle of the @xmath0th kind . in the conventional terminology , a particle of the @xmath0th kind for @xmath33",
    "is called `` @xmath0th - class particle .",
    "'' we can view the local state @xmath34 as a vacant site ( or a hole ) , which is often denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "however , for later convenience , it is better to use @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 and we shall stick to that convention .",
    "let @xmath36 be the basis of the single - site space @xmath37 .",
    "the tensor product @xmath38 corresponds to the configuration @xmath39 on the ring .",
    "the probability vector at time @xmath27 can be written as @xmath40 in this language , the master equation ( [ a : master1 ] ) becomes @xmath41 where the ( total ) markov matrix @xmath42 is of size @xmath43 by @xmath43 .",
    "this markov matrix can be written as the sum of local linear operators @xmath44 acting only on the @xmath32th and the @xmath45th components of the tensor product : @xmath46 where the action of the local markov matrices on a bond is given by @xmath47    note that off - diagonal elements of @xmath42 are @xmath48 or @xmath35 , and the diagonal elements are expressed as @xmath49 with nonpositive integers @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the sum of entries in each column of @xmath42 is @xmath35 , assuring the conservation of the total probability @xmath52 .",
    "the master equation can be solved formally as @xmath53 give information for physical properties of the model .",
    "the markov matrix has the eigenvalue 0 , and we call the corresponding right eigenvectors stationary states .",
    "all the other eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts ( perron - frobenius theorem @xcite ) , which characterize the relaxation to the stationary states .",
    "we remark that the markov matrix @xmath42 is hermitian only for @xmath24 , where it becomes the hamiltonian of the @xmath54-invariant heisenberg spin chain .      in view of the transition rule ( [ rule ] )",

    "let @xmath77 be the set of all labels for the basic sectors : @xmath78    we now introduce an alternative labeling of the basic sectors @xcite that will be very useful in the following : let @xmath79 be the total number of particles of classes @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 we have @xmath82 with the convention @xmath83 , and thus each basic sector of the @xmath4-asep can be labeled by the set @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",

    "then , the decomposition @xmath141 holds and is independent of the choice of the intermediate sectors @xcite .",
    "a crucial property of the identification operators is that they provide a conjugation between different sectors .",
    "more precisely , for any two sectors such that @xmath142 the following diagram commutes :    @xmath143    which means @xmath144 we shall call this type of relation a _ conjugation relation _ , relating the dynamics governed by @xmath92 and that governed by @xmath145 . the identification operator @xmath146 intertwines the two markov matrices @xmath92 and @xmath145 , and",
    "we call @xmath146 a _ conjugation matrix_. the relation ( [ mphi = phim ] ) was the key @xcite in proving the spectral properties ( [ spec - supset - spec ] ) and ( [ spec =- l(p+q)-spec ] ) . each right eigenvector @xmath147 with eigenvalue @xmath148 in the sector @xmath86 can be projected down by @xmath149 to the sector @xmath150 , and @xmath151 is also a right eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath148 in the sector @xmath86 ( under the assumption @xmath152 ) .",
    "in particular , the stationary state of a sector @xmath86 is mapped by the identification operator to the stationary state of any sector @xmath150 such that @xmath153 .",
    "the identification operator @xmath149 always maps an upper ( more complex ) sector @xmath86 into a lower ( simpler ) sector @xmath150 .",
    "this implies that identification matrix @xmath146 can not help us to construct a right eigenvector in the sector @xmath86 knowing the eigenvector with the same eigenvalue in a smaller sector @xmath150 .",
    "it would be very useful if we could _",
    "lift _ information from lower sectors to upper sectors in the hasse diagram .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work can be formulated as follows : can we construct a matrix @xmath154 which lifts up right eigenvectors from a lower sector @xmath150 to an upper sector @xmath86 ?",
    "this would be possible if we could define an operator @xmath154 from @xmath155 to @xmath91 such that the following diagram commutes : @xmath156 equivalently , for any sectors @xmath157 the conjugation matrix @xmath154 satisfies @xmath158 note that the directions of the vertical arrows are opposite as compared to those in the previous diagram ( [ diagcomm ] ) , which is a crucial difference .",
    "equivalently , comparing equation ( [ psim = mpsi ] ) with equation ( [ mphi = phim ] ) , we observe that the order of the products is opposite .",
    "the property ( [ psim = mpsi ] ) has the following important consequence : let @xmath159 be any eigenvector of @xmath145 with eigenvalue @xmath148 .",
    "then @xmath160 which means that @xmath161 is an eigenvector of @xmath92 with the same eigenvalue @xmath148 ( if @xmath162 ) . in other words ,",
    "the map @xmath154 allows to lift eigenvectors from a smaller sector to a larger sector and provides a constructive information from a simpler system to a more complex one ( whereas the identification operator @xmath146 erases information ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath154 is a very nontrivial property of the model . in the next section ,",
    "we review the construction of the stationary state , which will be generalized later to define @xmath154 .",
    "from this section on , we set @xmath108 and @xmath22 , _ i.e. _ we consider the tasep case , unless explicitly stated otherwise . in the @xmath4-tasep dynamics , each particle can hop to its right nearest - neighbor site if the target site is empty or occupied by a higher - class particle .",
    "a stationary state is a right eigenvector of the markov matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 .",

    "the solution to this problem came from two completely different directions .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the stationary state provided by the matrix product representation for the @xmath132-tasep could be interpreted in terms of weights in a binary tree .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite , these weights were rewritten in terms of dyck paths which also appear as trajectories of a queueing process and therefore the @xmath132-tasep was reinterpreted as a queueing process .",
    "this fact was generalized to the @xmath4-tasep which was mapped into a system of coupled queueing processes @xcite : this construction leads to the ferrari - martin algorithm for the stationary state of the @xmath4-tasep that we review in the next subsection .",

    "the multispecies exclusion process exhibits rich combinatorial properties that can be encoded in a recursive structure known as the hasse diagram .",

    "successive identifications allow one to reduce the initial multispecies system to the one - species system . in this procedure ,",
    "information is irreversibly lost .    in this paper , we have shown that the matrix product representation , which was originally used as a method for representing the stationary state , allows one to define conjugation operators that relate systems with different values of @xmath4 in the tasep case . therefore , the matrix ansatz provides a method to lift information from a simple system to a more complex one : it allows one to calculate not only the stationary state but some excited states as well , that describe how the system relaxes towards its steady state . more precisely , each link in the hasse diagram corresponds to a lifting operator and is associated to a different quadratic algebra .",
