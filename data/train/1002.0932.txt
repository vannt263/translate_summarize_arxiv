    "define _ levels _ in @xmath134 as follows : @xmath142 the _ radial average _ of a function @xmath143 with respect to these levels is @xmath144 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the radial average of @xmath145 gives an eigenfunction @xmath146 of the laplacian on @xmath134 with eigenvalue @xmath97 .",

    "these @xmath149 are similar to the spherical functions with eigenvalue @xmath97 on the tree as defined for example in .",
    "use the facts that @xmath151 and @xmath152 in equation to obtain @xmath153      assume first that @xmath161 .",
    "note that @xmath162 , and @xmath163 for @xmath27 .",
    "we use @xmath164 to find the recursion relation @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "this leads to @xmath167 for constants @xmath154 and @xmath155 defined by @xmath168 @xmath169 note that @xmath170 as the square root is nonzero due to the exclusion of @xmath171 .",
    "using the geometric series formula twice in equation , taking care with the @xmath172 term , we obtain @xmath173 observe that for the infinite sums to converge , we need @xmath174 .",
    "for @xmath175 it is easy to check that @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath175 , and that there is a real number @xmath178 so that the sums obtained from equation converge for @xmath179 .",
    "however for the eigenvalue @xmath180 we have @xmath181 and the infinite sum for @xmath182 will only converge for @xmath31 .",
    "the square root in equation is zero iff we have @xmath171 , which implies @xmath183 . in this case",
    "using the geometric series formula and the series @xmath185 , we obtain the required expression from . for the convergence of the two infinite sums obtained here we require @xmath186 which implies @xmath187 , which is consistent with the general case above .",
    "to finish the proof of our theorem , we use a refined version of the tauberian theorem by wiener - ikehara from ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.4 ) ) , which is a refinement of the tauberian theorem in @xcite .",
    "this theorem requires a function @xmath192 which converges for @xmath193 and has a simple pole at @xmath194 .",
    "we choose @xmath195 .",
    "the residue of @xmath192 at @xmath194 is @xmath196 that means @xmath197 for some function @xmath198 which is analytic for @xmath193 .",
    "check that @xmath198 is analytic for @xmath199 when @xmath200 .",
    "indeed , @xmath198 has poles wherever @xmath192 does , except we have removed the pole at @xmath194 . as @xmath192 has poles on the line @xmath201 at @xmath202 for any @xmath203",
    ", @xmath198 has no poles on @xmath204 for @xmath200 .",
    "note also @xmath205 .",
    "let @xmath209 vanish for @xmath208 , be non - decreasing , continuous from the right and such that @xmath210 exists for @xmath211 .",
    "suppose that for some number @xmath212 , there is a constant @xmath90 ( necessarily @xmath213 ) such that the analytic function @xmath214 converges to a boundary function @xmath215 in @xmath216 as @xmath217 .",
    "let @xmath218 be the supremum of all possible numbers @xmath219 .",
    "then @xmath220      notice that as a consequence of when @xmath56 is even , @xmath209 will jump only at integer values of @xmath18 ( the case where @xmath56 is odd works similarly , except jumps occur only when @xmath223 is an integer ) . in this case , writing @xmath224 $ ] or equivalently @xmath225 we have @xmath226 letting @xmath227 we obtain the following estimates for the @xmath228 and @xmath229 respectively : @xmath230 @xmath231 as this must hold for all @xmath232 , we obtain @xmath233 this means that for large integers @xmath234 we have an approximation of @xmath235 and hence @xmath51 as follows @xmath236 where from the definition of @xmath237 we require @xmath54 to be even ( because when @xmath56 is odd , we take @xmath238 in equation ) .",
    "using equation it is clear that for any real @xmath18 such that @xmath239 for a non - negative integer @xmath240 , we have @xmath241 .",
    "remark : we now discuss why we required that @xmath85 was non - bipartite . most of the proof above can be used to show a weaker result , but theorem [ t1 ] will not hold for bipartite @xmath85 . the method of proof works for the bipartite case up to lemma [ lua ] , where we have to consider the effects on @xmath98 of @xmath242 , the eigenvalue of the laplacian which occurs exactly when @xmath85 is bipartite .",
    "the series for @xmath243 requires @xmath31 to converge , and we obtain @xmath244 as before the residue of @xmath245 at @xmath194 equals @xmath90 , but now the function @xmath246 only converges to a boundary function for @xmath247 .",
    "the tauberian theorem can still be applied , but only shows @xmath248 the difference between this estimate and that in equation is that the left and right estimates differ by a factor @xmath249 instead of the factor @xmath157 obtained in the non - bipartite case , and it is no longer possible to deduce a precise limit from the estimates ( note that @xmath209 can jump at any integer value @xmath18 ) .",
