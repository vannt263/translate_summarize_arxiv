    "this finding stimulated a lot of experimental and theoretical activity .",
    "data accumulated during 1997 allowed to increase the statistics by roughly a factor @xmath8 .",
    "the measurements of dis at high @xmath0 based on all available @xmath1 data are presented and compared to the sm expectations in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the same data are then used to search for new particles possessing direct couplings to lepton - quark pairs , namely leptoquarks and squarks in susy models where r - parity is violated ( ) .",
    "preliminary results on leptoquark production are shown in section  [ sec : leptoquarks ] , together with some remarks on particular phenomenological aspects at hera .",
    "analogous constraints on resonant -squarks production are presented in section  [ sec : rpvsusy ] .",

    "these errors are dominated by the uncertainty on the electromagnetic energy scale of the calorimeter and vary between @xmath12 at low @xmath0 and about @xmath13 at the highest @xmath0 .",
    "p0.40p0.60    & = 0.7    the nc dis expectation agrees well with the data at @xmath14 , while at larger @xmath0 deviations are observed with a slight deficit of events between 10000 @xmath15 and @xmath16 and a slight excess at @xmath0 @xmath17 @xmath16 .",

    "tevatron experiments exclude first generation lq masses below @xmath27  @xcite , independently of any assumption on @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , for low @xmath23 , an important discovery potential remains for hera .",
    "for example , if @xmath29 , the d@xmath30 experiment excludes masses only up to about @xmath31 , while h1 rules out masses below @xmath32 if @xmath33 , and @xmath34 if @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the delphi  @xcite and opal  @xcite experiments at lep recently performed a search for single lq production and exclude lq masses below @xmath36 for @xmath37 , which because of the smaller centre of mass energy can not be competitive with the sensitivity achieved at hera .",
    "h1 also carried out a search for lepton flavor violating lqs  @xcite , looking for lqs decaying into @xmath38 events observed by h1 and discussed in  @xcite fail significantly the kinematical constraints that should hold for the process @xmath39 . ] and @xmath40 through the coupling @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",

    "[ fig : lqtau ] for several fixed values of @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    ", h1 excludes lqs lighter than 255 gev , which significantly improves the limit of about @xmath45 obtained from third generation lq searches carried out at the tevatron  @xcite , unless @xmath28 is much smaller .",
    "indirect limits on @xmath46 are also improved by typically one order of magnitude .",
    "p0.50p0.50    & = 0.5",
    "the most general superpotential consistent with the gauge symmetry and supersymmetry of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains yukawa terms of superfields which violate lepton ( @xmath47) and baryon ( @xmath48)number .",
    "these interactions can give rise to rapid proton decay . in order to avoid this problem , one introduces additional discrete symmetries which forbid some or all of the dangerous yukawa couplings .",
    "a radical solution is achieved by requiring r - parity conservation where r - parity is defined by @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the spin of a given particle , so that the particle content of the mssm can be classified in sm particles with @xmath51 and superpartners with @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48violating yukawa interactions in the superpotential being odd under @xmath53 vanish . however , phenomenologically it is already sufficient to forbid the @xmath48violating interactions and to constrain the @xmath47violating terms such that they are consistent with the remaining , much weaker experimental bounds .    in such a scenario",
    "one can have the term @xmath54 in the superpotential , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the lepton and quark @xmath57-doublet superfields , respectively , @xmath58 is the down - quark @xmath57-singlet superfield , and @xmath59 denote the dimensionless yukawa couplings .",
    "the indices @xmath60 refer to the fermion generations .",
    "most interestingly at hera , the @xmath53violating couplings with @xmath61 can give rise to resonant squark production  @xcite .- processes at hera can be found in  @xcite . ] in @xmath62 scattering , the possible production channels are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in particular valence @xmath65 quarks allow to probe @xmath66 squarks and @xmath67 couplings .",
    "the present indirect bounds on @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite leave an interesting search window for hera with the exception of @xmath69 in which case the limit from neutrinoless @xmath70 decay precludes the observation of effects at hera .",
    "the possible squark interpretations of the observed excess of events in nc dis reported in  @xcite have been studied in detail in  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider scenarios with a single nonvanishing coupling @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that gluinos are heavier than squarks , so that @xmath71 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "the resonantly produced squark can then decay into @xmath72 via the @xmath73-coupling @xmath67 resembling a scalar leptoquark , and into a neutralino @xmath74 or a chargino @xmath75 plus a quark via @xmath53-conserving gauge interactions . in the latter cases ,",
    "the final state is determined by the subsequent neutralino and chargino decays .",
    "the heavier gauginos may cascade down to the lightest one , while the lightest neutralino may finally decay into @xmath76 or @xmath77 , involving again the coupling @xmath78 .",
    "similar - decay channels exist for the @xmath79 with the exception of the @xmath80-mode .",
    "an illustrative example is shown in fig .  [ fig : sqgauge ] . in  @xcite ,",
    "a classification is given of all possible final states in terms of several distinguishable event topologies .",
    "recently , the susygen  @xcite package has been extended to include @xmath73-susy processes at hera .",
    "the new version which will be released shortly allows a complete event generation for all possible channels .",
    "p0.50p0.50    & = 0.5      the h1 collaboration @xcite analysed final states containing an @xmath81 and several jets .",
    "since the lepton appears late in the cascade decay chain , it is expected to be degraded in energy .",
    "consequently , the main selection criteria require an @xmath81 candidate reconstructed at high @xmath82 together with two forward jets .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of the 289 events selected is shown in fig .  [ fig : dndms3 ] and compared with the distribution of the @xmath83 events expected in the sm .",
    "the agreement is good . in the `` wrong sign '' channel , @xmath84 multijet , one candidate",
    "is observed , while @xmath85 are expected .",
    "p0.40p0.60    & = 0.6      combining the lq - like channel @xmath86 jet with the @xmath87 multijet channels , one can put mass - dependent limits on the couplings @xmath67 .",
    "to this end , four different sets of values have been chosen for the mssm parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , leading to four typical scenarios for the lightest neutralino  : photino - like states with mass 40 , 100 , and 150 gev , and a zino - like state with mass 40 gev . given @xmath67 and the squark mass ,",
    "the relevant widths and branching ratios are fixed . the h1 analysis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqlimits ] excludes squark masses up to 262 gev for @xmath91 .",
    "as expected , in the case of @xmath92 , the h1 bound is not competitive with the best indirect constraint coming from the non - observation of neutrinoless @xmath70 decay .",
    "however , for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the best indirect limits from atomic parity violation are improved by the h1 direct bounds in a large region of the parameter space .",
    "especially , for large @xmath95 masses , the upper bounds on @xmath93 and @xmath94 are decreased by as much as a factor 4 .",
    "p0.40p0.60    & = 0.5    the @xmath73 squark scenarios considered above are also constrained by the first generation lq searches at the tevatron .",
    "however , these bounds become rather weak when @xmath96 is small , a possibility which exists due to the presence of @xmath53-conserving decays .",
    "recently , the tevatron experiments have performed a dedicated search @xcite analysing final states with like - sign electrons plus jets .",
    "these may originate from the decay of pair - produced squarks .",
    "assuming five degenerate squark flavours , squark masses below 252 gev are excluded .",
    "if one squark ( e.g. the lightest stop ) is much lighter than the others , the cross section is significantly smaller .",
    "the corresponding mass bound is estimated  @xcite to decrease to about @xmath97 .",
    "results on neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering at high momentum transfer derived from the @xmath62 data taken by the h1 and zeus experiments in 19941997 , have been presented and compared to the standard model expectations .",
    "the differential cross sections in terms of @xmath0 are found to be in good agreement with the sm predictions .",
    "a slight excess at high @xmath0 observed in the 19941996 data still persists with the 1997 data included , but with less significance .    using the same data , a search for leptoquarks and for squarks with r - parity violating couplings has been performed",
    "no evidence was found for the existence of such species .",
    "the resulting bounds on leptoquark / squark masses and yukawa couplings to lepton - quark pairs improve the constraints from other colliders and from low energy experiments in important regions of the parameter space .",
