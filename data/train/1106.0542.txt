    "it is now widely accepted that ` feedback ' from radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) keeps the bulk of the diffuse x - ray gas hot in the cores of clusters of galaxies ( e.g. rafferty et al .",
    "2008 ; cavagnolo et al .",
    "although the underlying plasma microphysics are complex ( mcnamara & nulsen  2007 ) , it is also clear that agn heating is not always and everywhere 100 per cent effective .",
    "some gas does succeed in cooling , perhaps in an episodic way when the agn is in quiescence , and accumulates in a reservoir of cool ionized and molecular gas ( e.g. edge  2001 ; edge et al .",

    "2007 ) , giving rise to star formation ( crawford et al .  1999 ; odea et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the associated emission line nebulosity has been the subject of many investigations over the years , focussing variously on the kinematics of the gas , the origin of its filamentary morphology , its relationship to the radio source , the role of galaxy interactions and mergers , and the nature of the excitation source .",
    "progress on the latter front came with the simulations of ferland et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who showed that extra heating by dissipative mhd processes or non - thermal excitation by high energy cosmic rays could account for the unusually strong ro - vibrational 2  lines and other emission line ratios which are at odds with the predictions of photoionization models .",
    "an issue that has seldom been addressed is whether this cool gas reservoir plays an active role in the feedback cycle or whether it is just an interesting byproduct thereof , serving merely to show that cooling and agn feedback are taking place but of no greater significance .",
    "it is of particular interest to know whether the cool gas actually fuels the accretion on to the supermassive black hole . for many years",
    ", it has been hypothesized that ` hot feedback ' in the form of quasi - spherical bondi accretion of partially - cooled x - ray gas could be the mechanism at work ( e.g. allen et al .",
    "2006 ; narayan & fabian  2011 ) .",
    "this model has , however , encountered problems and appears to be energetically infeasible except in low - power systems ( e.g. soker  2010 ; rafferty et al .",
    "2006 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "2011 ) , leading to the development of the ` cold feedback ' model in which the agn accretes directly from the cool gas reservoir ( see pizzolato & soker  2005 ,  2010 and references therein ) .",
    "non - linear overdensities in the x - ray gas throughout the inner 30  are assumed to cool and flow steadily inwards .",
    "blobs with an overdensity exceeding a critical factor @xmath4 relative to the ambient medium undergo catastrophic cooling , contract and enter a free - fall plunge over the final 10 , creating a reservoir of cool gas for star formation and black hole accretion .",
    "pizzolato & soker  ( 2010 ) demonstrated that the infalling blobs efficiently lose angular momentum via drag forces and mutual collisions , thereby removing a potential obstacle to the accretion .",
    "the means by which the molecular gas couples to the agn output  and thereby regulates the cold feedback process  are , however , unclear ; outflows driven by jets or collimated winds may be involved ( e.g. soker & pizzolato  2005 ; wagner & bicknell  2011 ) .    aspects of the cold feedback model are steadily gaining observational support . in ngc 1275 ,",

    ". there may be some parallels with the radio galaxies 3c  31 and 3c  264 which both exhibit double - horned co profiles from @xmath23  of molecular hydrogen , possibly acquired through cannibalism with gas - rich galaxies over the past few tens of  ( lim et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "once within the bcg , the accretion stream will interact with the local interstellar medium . depending on the relative velocity of impact ,",
    "this collision may generate shocks and disturbed kinematics . the locally elevated 2  velocity dispersion in the south - eastern 2  peak and nearby dust feature ( fig .  [ fig:2ahst ] ) may be signatures of just such an interaction .",
    "hydrodynamic interaction may lead to a loss in angular momentum of the accreted material , driving gas into the circumnuclear regions as a potential fuel source for the agn .",
    "mutual collisions among the 2  cloud ensemble in its dense inner regions provide a further mechanism for angular momentum loss , as argued by pizzolato & soker  ( 2010 ) .    whilst the smooth rotation curve of fig .",
    "[ fig:2ah2kinemcut ] suggests that the 2  is rotating in the potential of the bcg , the existence of two distinct 2  peaks could suggest that the 2  clouds are on highly elliptical orbits , with the peaks corresponding to their apastrons ( see e.g. fig .",

    "the distortions of the 2  isovelocity contours in fig .",
    "[ fig:2ah2 ] point to departures from simple circular motions , possibly in the form of disk warping and elliptical orbits .",
    "we note a resemblance to the twin peaks of molecular gas which are commonly observed within the central kiloparsec  of barred and starburst galaxies ( e.g. kenney et al .",
    "1992 ; jogee et al .  2005 ) .",
    "such peaks result from gas being driven into the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) of the barred potential , which is associated with the transition from the highly elongated family of x@xmath24 loop orbits to the smaller and more circular x@xmath25 orbit family .",
    "the x@xmath24 orbits are aligned with the major axis of the bar , whose leading edges typically exhibit radial dust - lanes along which gas flows into the nuclear regions . whilst there is no obvious evidence for a bar in the bcg , the presence of the nearby companion galaxy , or triaxility intrinsic to the bcg itself , may induce a non - axisymmetric potential with analogous dynamical consequences for the accreted gas .",
    "we are , however , unable to infer whether the observed 2  peaks correspond to gas flowing along the major axis of a bar in the early stages of inflow , or whether the material has already been funelled down to the ilr , and do not pursue this interpretation any further .",

    "one explanation could be that the current radio outburst may have initially evacuated gas from the inner regions or otherwise suppressed star formation ; the resolved lateral extent of the current 5  ghz radio source ( i.e. perpendicular to the inferred jet direction ) in sanders et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is @xmath33  ( 3.5 ) . the molecular gas could be supported by the associated magnetic field and thus prevented from collapsing to form stars , as argued by fabian et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and ferland et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the  filaments in ngc 1275 and the excitation of their line emission .",
    "it is also possible that the current star formation rate is unrepresentative of the average value on gyr timescales ; the star formation rate could increase and consume the gas more quickly in the future .",
    "magnetic support of the gas , if sufficiently strong , could hinder the accretion onto the black hole .",
    "outflows driven by the radio source provide a further means to disrupt its fuel supply . in section 3.2",
    ", we noted that some of the diffuse co emission within the bcg is found at relatively high velocity , suggestive of an outflow .",
    "less than 1 per cent of the current outburst enthalpy would suffice to accelerate @xmath34  of molecular gas to a velocity of 600 , so the energetics are feasible and similar to the fraction of the outburst energy required to drive the metal outflows in clusters ( kirkpatrick et al . 2009b , 2011 ) .",
    "if such mechanisms are , however , not effective in regulating the accretion and the bulk of the 2  is instead accreted rapidly by the black hole over several orbital timescales , this could generate an outburst exceeding @xmath3  ( for @xmath28 ) .",
    "such an outburst would be comparable with most powerful currently known , in ms0735.6 + 7421 ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ) and hydra a ( wise et al .",
    "further simulations of cold feedback including the effects of magnetic fields and outflows on the molecular gas are required to discriminate between such possibilities .",
    "not withstanding these uncertainties , the new observations of 2a 0335 + 096 presented here , revealing an ample supply of cool molecular gas available to fuel the radio source on the required timescale of 25 - 100  and offset icm cooling , further bolster the case for cold agn feedback .",
