    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are cosmic gamma ray emissions with typical fluxes of the order of @xmath1 to @xmath2ergs @xmath3 with the rise time as low as @xmath4 s and the duration of bursts from @xmath5 to @xmath6 s. the distribution of the bursts is isotropic and they are believed to have a cosmological origin , with the observations showing that grbs originate at extra - galactic distances .",
    "the large inferred distances imply isotropic energy losses as large as @xmath7 ergs for grb 971214 and @xmath8 ergs for grb 990123 . for detailed reviews of grbs properties see @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the widely accepted interpretation of the phenomenology of grbs is that the observable effects are due to the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding fireball , whose primal cause is not yet known @xcite .    one fundamental question related to grbs is how many intrinsically different categories they have .",
    "each type may correspond to an intrinsically different type of progenitor , as well as to a different type of central engine . from the grb sample collected by batse",
    ", a clear bimodal distribution of bursts was identified @xcite .",
    "two criteria have been used to classify the bursts .",
    "the primary criterion is duration , and a separation line of 2 s has been adopted to separate the double - hump duration distribution of the batse bursts .",
    "the second criterion is the hardness - usually denoted as the hardness ratio within the two energy bands of the detector . on average ,",
    "short grbs are harder , while long grbs are softer .",
    "hence the observations show the existence of two classes of grbs , long - soft , and short - hard , respectively .",
    "the short grbs are hard because of the harder low - energy spectral index of the grb spectral function @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , short grb spectra are broadly similar to those of long grbs , if only the first 2 seconds of data of the long grbs are taken into account . afterglows observation shed some light into the physical nature of these two types of grbs .",
    "the host galaxies of long grbs are exclusively star forming galaxies , predominantly irregular dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observations suggest that most , if not all of the long grbs are produced during the core collapse of massive stars , called collapsars , as has been also suggested theoretically @xcite .",
    "both the observations and the theoretical models also support the idea that long grbs are associated with supernova explosions @xcite .    the observations of swift and of hete led to a very different picture for the short grbs @xcite .",
    "the basic result of all these observations is that short grbs are intrinsically different from the long grbs .",
    "most of the short grbs are found at the outskirts of elliptical galaxies , where the star forming rate is very low .",
    "even if they can be associated with star forming regions , they are rather far away from the active zones @xcite . in several cases",
    "a robust host galaxy has not been identified , but the host galaxy is of early type .",
    "deep supernova searches have been performed , but with negative results @xcite .",
    "this suggests that short grbs may be associated with mergers of compact objects , like neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole mergers , white - dwarf - neutron star or black hole mergers etc . @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the conversion of neutron stars to strange quark stars may be the energy source for the cosmological gamma ray bursts was suggested in @xcite .",
    "neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries can accrete sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to become strange stars . at the moment of its birth",
    "the strange star is very hot , with an interior temperature of around @xmath9 k. by approximating the strange matter by a free fermi gas , the thermal energy of the star is @xmath10 ergs , where @xmath11 is the average mass density , @xmath12 g/@xmath13 is the nuclear density , @xmath14 is the radius of the star in units of @xmath15 cm , and @xmath16 is the temperature in units of @xmath17 k. for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 the thermal energy of the newly formed quark star is @xmath21 . in the original model of @xcite",
    "it was assumed that the star would cool by emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos , and that the neutrino pair annihilation process @xmath22 operates near the strange star surface .",
    "the energy deposited due to this process is @xmath23 ergs , where @xmath24 is the initial temperature .",
    "the time scale for the deposition is around 1 s. on the other hand , the processes @xmath25 and @xmath26 play an important role in the energy deposition .",
    "the integrated neutrino optical depth due to all these processes is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass density in units of @xmath17 g/@xmath29 .",
    "the deposition energy can be estimated to be @xmath30 ergs . here",
    "the value of the neutron drip density , @xmath31 has been used , and it has been assumed that all the thermal energy of the star is lost in neutrinos .",
    "the process @xmath32 inevitably leads to the creation of a fireball , and this fireball will expand outward .",
    "the expanding shell interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium , and its kinetic energy is radiated through non - thermal processes in shocks .",
    "however , this model did not consider any internal dynamics , e.g. heat transport , viscous damping , shock dissipation etc , which can affect the neutrino emission dramatically .",
    "in fact the numerical simulations indicate that the temperature on the neutrinosphere is rapidly changing with time , steady neutrino emission is not possible .",
    "the presence of oscillations of the resulting quark star produced by the phase transition induced collapse of a neutron star is one of the most intriguing features of the simulations performed with our newtonian numerical code introduced in @xcite .",
    "recently , the collapse process with a conformally flat approximation to general relativity was also simulated in @xcite .",
    "the works of @xcite focus on the gravitational wave signals emitted by the collapse process .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider another important implication of this result , namely , the effect of the oscillations of the newly formed quark star on the neutrino emission .",
    "the oscillations can enhance the neutrino emission rate in a pulsating manner , and the neutrinos are emitted in a much shorter time scale .",
    "therefore the neutron - quark phase transition in compact objects may be the energy source of grbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the phase transition process from neutron stars to hybrid stars , which consists of a mixture of strange quark matter and hadronic matter , is summarized in section ii .",
    "we describe our numerical code , which is used to simulate the dynamical evolution of star after phase transition in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the neutrino and antineutrino emission from the neutrinosphere and the electron / positron pair creation rate due to neutrino and antineutrino annihilation process . in section",
    "v , we calculate mass ejection from stellar surface by absorbing neutrinos / pairs and their subsequent acceleration by the pairs outside the star .",
    "in section vi we apply our model to grbs . finally a brief summary and discussion is presented in section vii .",
    "the quark structure of the nucleons , suggested by quantum chromodynamics , indicates the possibility of a hadron - quark phase transition at high densities and/or temperatures , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "theories of the strong interaction , like , for example , the quark bag models , suppose that breaking of physical vacuum takes place inside hadrons .",
    "if the hypothesis of the quark matter is true , then some of neutron stars could actually be strange stars , built entirely of strange matter @xcite .",
    "the central density of compact stellar objects may reach values of up to ten times nuclear - matter saturation density , and therefore a phase transition to deconfined quark matter , or pion and kaon condensates , should take place at least in the central region of the neutron stars . in the case of the transition to quark matter , in addition to a phase of unpaired normal quark matter , present at low densities , several superconducting phases , such as the * two - flavor color superconductor * ( 2sc ) phase or the gapless color - flavor - lock ( cfl ) phase can also occur at the large baryon densities reached at the central regions of a compact star .",
    "the transition from the hadronic to the quark phase could proceed in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "a transition from hadronic matter to normal quark matter or to a 2sc phase takes place , due to the increase of the baryonic density at the center of the star .",
    "this increase in density may be due to mass accretion from the fall - back material or rapidly spin - down of the star .",
    "the newly formed hybrid or quark star , containing some 2sc quark matter , can become meta - stable , and decay into a star containing a cfl phase @xcite . * pure hadronic compact stars above a threshold value of their mass are metastable .",
    "the metastability of hadronic stars originates from the finite size effects in the formation process of the first strange quark matter drop in the hadronic environment @xcite . *",
    "a phase transition between the hadronic and quark phase occurs when the pressures and the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the pressures and the chemical potentials in the hadron and quark phase , respectively . * in the present section , unless otherwise explicitly specified , we use the natural system of units with @xmath38*. if the transition pressure is less than that existing at the center of the compact object , the transition can occur . for finite values of the surface tension , complicated structures can develop in the mixed phase , such as drops , rods , and slabs @xcite .",
    "the formation of a mixed phase is the result of two competing processes : the size of the barrier that the system has to overcome in order to form a structure , and the size of the perturbation of the system .",
    "one method to see if the phase transition can proceed or not is to compare the temperature reached by the system immediately after the conversion with the height of the barrier .",
    "if the temperature is not much lower than the height of the barrier , the structure formation proceeds thermally , and it is very rapid @xcite . if the temperature is low , new structures can form only via quantum nucleation , which is a very slow process @xcite .    * the thermal nucleation rate of quark drops can be estimated in the framework of the nucleation theory as @xmath39 , where the prefactor @xmath40 ( the product of the dynamical prefactor and of the statistical prefactor ) is the product of a density and a growth factor , @xmath41 represents the work needed to form the smallest drop capable of growing , and @xmath42 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath43 corresponds to the maximum of the free energy of the drop in the new phase .",
    "the dynamical prefactor for the nucleation rate of bubbles or droplets in first - order phase transitions for the case where both viscous damping and thermal dissipation are significant has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "this formalism was applied for the study of the nucleation of quark - gluon plasma from hadronic matter in @xcite . by taking into account the explicit forms of the temperature dependent quark matter equation of state , of the dissipative factors and of the statistical prefactor , one obtains a complicated dependence of the prefactor on the temperature . however , the prefactor in this model is based on poorly known physical parameters ( like , for example , the shear viscosity of the hadronic phase ) . in order to obtain some qualitative estimates of the nucleation rate",
    "we use the thermodynamical approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the form of the prefactor can be obtained from general thermodynamical considerations as @xmath44 , and it is very little dependent on some particular choices ( for example in the low temperature limit the prefactor in the expression for @xmath45 can be replaced by the baryon chemical potential ) .",
    "this form for the prefactor does not include any kinematics , e.g. the microscopic processes required to transform a gas of hadrons into a gas of quarks .",
    "in the expression of the nucleation rate the dominant term is the exponential . *",
    "the free energy is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the pressure difference , @xmath48 is the surface tension , @xmath49 is the curvature energy density and @xmath50 is the difference in the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath51 is the total baryon number in the quark drop @xcite .",
    "the free energy has a maximum at the critical radius @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding free energy is @xmath55 /3c^{2}.\\ ] ] the number @xmath56 of drops of the new phase formed inside the old phase in a volume @xmath57 in a time @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the spacing between two drops in the mixed phase .",
    "the number of drops in a volume @xmath57 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "the number of drops produced while the front moves over a distance @xmath62 must be of the order of the drops that are present in the mixed phase , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the velocity of the front and @xmath65 its surface area .",
    "therefore in order for thermal nucleation take place the condition @xmath66 must be satisfied .",
    "the process of absorption of a hadron into a pure quark matter phase can also be described phenomenologically as the fusion of a small drop of quarks growing into a much larger drop .",
    "* the nature of the conversion process from the neutron to the quark matter is not yet fully understood , and there is no clear theoretical evidence if it is a deflagration or a detonation . indeed , for realistic equations of state of quark and neutron matter and when matter is assumed to be in @xmath67 equilibrium , detonation is difficult to achieve @xcite .",
    "however , it would be still possible to obtain a detonation if the matter immediately after the front is not yet in @xmath67-equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that neutrino trapping delays @xmath67 stability . according to the analysis of @xcite , when the drop starts expanding",
    ", the process of conversion can be extremely fast , within the layer in which deconfinement is energetically favorable , even in the absence of the weak processes . in this case , the conversion front moves at the velocity of the deflagration front @xmath68 , which approaches the velocity of sound .",
    "as the conversion layer moves outward , the front enters the region of mixed phase , where @xmath68 decreases until it vanishes at the low density boundary of the mixed phase . *",
    "if the conversion is indeed extremely fast , taking place at speeds close to the speed of sound , then the typical time scale for the transition can be estimated as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the radius of the neutron star and @xmath71 is the speed of the sound .    a simple phenomenological model for the evolution of the quark phase can be obtained by assuming the relation @xmath72 @xcite , which gives for the transition time scale @xmath73 from a microscopic quark drop to a quark matter distribution of a macroscopic size the expression @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the neutron star radius in units of @xmath15 cm , @xmath76 is the initial size of the quark drop @xcite , and @xmath77 , which could be as large as @xmath78 @xcite , is the number of quark drops inside the core of the neutron star . in this case @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the phase transition may take place in a time scale much shorter than submillisecond .",
    "in this paper we focus on studying the phase - transition induced collapse of neutron star to a hybrid quark star , which consists of a mixture of strange quark matter and hadronic matter , and want to demonstrate that this process can produce relativistic ejecta , which could be a mechanism for grbs . in order to avoid other complications we would like to simulate a non - rotating , phase - induced collapse of a compact object , with a mixed phase of quark matter and nuclear matter . in this model gravitational radiation will not be emitted .",
    "hence we can focus on studying the neutrino and pair emissions and subsequently gamma - ray emission via interaction between the interstellar medium from this system . in our simulations",
    ", we will not simulate the phase transition process .",
    "instead , we assume that a fast phase transition has happened ( e.g. , via a detonation mode ) so that the initial neutron star has converted to a quark star in a timescale shorter than the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "we assume that the normal matter inside the initial neutron star has suddenly changed to quark matter at t=0 .",
    "this is achieved by changing the eos at t=0 after the initial hydrostatic equilibrium neutron star has been constructed .",
    "we then simulate the resulting dynamics of the system triggered by the collapse .",
    "our numerical code is based on the three - dimensional numerical simulation in newtonian hydrodynamics and gravity .",
    "the quark matter of the mixed phase is described by the mit bag model and the normal nuclear matter is described by an ideal fluid eos .",
    "this code has been used to study the gravitational wave emission from the phase - induced collapse of the neutron stars @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main equations and the numerical scheme involved .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",

    "such schemes have the ability to resolve discontinuities in the solution ( e.g. , shock waves ) by construction .",
    "moreover , they have high accuracy in regions where the fluid flow is smooth . in general",
    ", integrating the hydrodynamics equations by a hrsc scheme involves the choices of an appropriate numerical flux formula and a reconstruction method of the state variables @xmath94 for solving the riemann problems at the cell interfaces . in our code",
    ", we use the roe s approximate riemann solver @xcite for the numerical fluxes and the third - order piecewise parabolic method @xcite for the reconstruction . for the temporal discretization",
    ", we use a basic two - step method to achieve second - order accuracy in time .    in the simulations",
    ", we introduced a very low density atmosphere outside the star .",
    "the  artificial ",
    "atmosphere is not physical , but it is important for the stability of the hydrodynamical code .",
    "this is due to the problem that the hydrodynamical codes can not in general handle vacuum regions where the density is zero . in order to avoid a significant influence of the atmosphere on the dynamics of the physical system , it is necessary to choose the density of the atmosphere @xmath95 to be much smaller than the density scale of interest . for the results reported in section 3.4 , we set @xmath95 to be @xmath96 .",
    "the effects of different atmospherical values have been compared in @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for neutron stars is highly uncertain .",
    "we could try all possible existing realistic eos in our study . however , the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that during the phase - transition induced collapse of a neutron star extremely intense , pulsating and very high energy neutrinos can be emitted .",
    "the effect is governed mainly by the amount of pressure reduction after the phase transition as compared to the initial neutron star model . for simplicity we will use a polytropic eos for the initial equilibrium neutron star : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are constants . on the initial time slice ,",

    "where @xmath102 , we have a pure quark core ( region i ) , which is described by the mit bag model equation of state , so that the pressure @xmath87 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the bag constant , and @xmath105 is a critical density for which all the hadrons are deconfined into quarks",
    ". it should be noticed that @xmath106 is not in the usual form of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the ( rest frame ) total energy density .",
    "it is because in our newtonian simulations , we use the rest mass density @xmath83 and specific internal energy @xmath91 as fundamental variables in the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "we assume that the quark core is absolutely stable .",
    "the quark core is surrounded by a mixed phase of quark and nuclear matter ( region ii ) that can exist if the density of the region is higher than a certain critical value @xmath109 ( quark seeds can spontaneously produce everywhere when @xmath110 ) .",

    "@xmath114 is not necessarily equal to @xmath99 .",
    "finally , we have a normal nuclear matter region ( region iii ) , extending from @xmath115 to the surface of the star , so that in this region * @xmath116 a more detailed discussion about such hybrid quark stars can be found in @xcite .    the total energy density @xmath108 , which includes the rest mass contribution , is decomposed as @xmath117 .",
    "we choose @xmath118 in our simulations to take into account the possibility that the nuclear matter may not be stable during the phase transition process , and hence some quark seeds could appear inside the nuclear matter , or the convection , which can occur during the phase transition process , can mix some quark matter with the nuclear matter . in the presence of the quark seeds in the nuclear matter , the effective adiabatic index will be reduced .",
    "the possible values of @xmath119 range from 145 mev to 190 mev @xcite . for @xmath120",
    ", the quarks will be deconfined from nucleons .",
    "the value of @xmath121 is model dependent ; it could range from 4 to 8 @xmath122 @xcite , where @xmath123 is the nuclear density .",
    "there are two issues regarding our eos model to be addressed : ( 1 ) it should be noted that , for simplicity , we do not include the change in the internal energy from the phase transition when setting the initial data for the collapse .",
    "the binding energy released in the phase transition effectively leads to a slightly harder eos due to the thermal pressure .",
    "this could be modeled by using a larger value of @xmath114 ( comparing to the one we used in this work ) . however , as long as the eos after the phase transition is softer than that of the initial neutron star , the star will still collapse and stellar pulsations will be triggered .",
    "( 2 ) furthermore , the parameter @xmath109 in our eos model should be considered as the density below which the matter is dominated by hadronic matter .",
    "it is noted that strange quark matter ( if it is more stable ) can not convert back to hadronic matter by decreasing the density .",
    "however , when a fluid element originally in the mixed phase moves to the lower density region ( @xmath124 ) , the fluid element will mix with a large amount of hadronic matter .",
    "hence , we approximate that the pressure in the outer region of the star is dominated by the hadronic part , which is modeled by an ideal gas .    in the simulations , we choose @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 mev and @xmath128 .",
    "the transition density @xmath109 is defined to be at the point where @xmath106 vanishes initially .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixed_eos ] ) , we have used a very simple linear combination of strange quark matter eos and hadronic matter to represent the eos of mixed phase , which consists of a mixture of strange quark drops and hadronic matter .",

    "the equation of state used by us reproduces quite well the eos proposed in @xcite to describe the mixed quark - hadron phase .",
    "it is important to note that the main purpose of our paper is to focus on the study of the dynamical response of the star after a sudden phase transition , no matter what the fine details of the phase transition are .",
    "a full and exact description of the phase transition would require a very precise knowledge of the physical parameters describing both quark and hadronic matter .",
    "however , taking into account the uncertainties in our present knowledge of the properties of matter at high densities , our investigations could certainly give at least a qualitative picture of the astrophysical implications of hadron - quark phase transitions in compact stars .",
    "*      for a new born compact star , the internal temperature is so high that neutrinos will be trapped inside the star for at least a few seconds ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a general review ) .",

    "hence , the oscillation period is smaller for more massive stars because they have higher density .",

    ", the two shells will merge into one single shell and move at a new bulk velocity of @xmath270 ( correspondingly , with the lorentz factor @xmath271 ) . during the process",
    ", a portion of the initial bulk kinetic energy will be dissipated as random internal energy .",
    "we denote the average lorentz factor of the random internal energy as @xmath272 .",
    "since momentum and energy are conserved in the collision , we have @xcite , @xmath273 @xmath274 it is then easy to get the solution for @xmath275 and @xmath272 as @xmath276 @xmath277 @xmath278 the efficiency of transferring bulk kinetic energy into internal energy is @xmath279    when two shells collide , the emission from the shock - accelerated electrons will correspond to a single pulse in the light curve of the grb .",
    "the rising time of the pulse is mainly determined by the time needed for the shocks to cross the two shells . since the merged shell is moving toward us ultra - relativistically with a lorentz factor of @xmath271 , only a small part of the shell ( with an opening angle of @xmath280 ) will be seen by us .",
    "the decay time of the pulse is then mainly determined by the arrival time lag of a photon emitted at the angle of @xmath281 as compared with the photon emitted simultaneously at the line of sight .",
    "usually , the decay time is longer than the rising time , so we can use the decay time to characterize the width of the pulse , i.e. @xcite @xmath282      according to our simulations , at least more than 10 shells can be ejected during the phase transition of a neutron star in the first 3 ms . among these shells ,",
    "a few will have isotropic energies larger than @xmath78 ergs and expand ultra - relativistically with lorentz factors larger than @xmath283 ( cf .",
    "tables 1 - 4 ) .",
    "note that although our simulations only last for about 3 ms , the actual duration of the oscillation process may last for several hundreds milliseconds , as argued at the end of our section 6.1 . during this period , tens or even hundreds of ultra - relativistic shells might be ejected , each with an energy larger than @xmath284 ergs .",
    "the total energy enclosed in these relativistic shells may be @xmath253  @xmath252 ergs .",
    "we suggest that the collision between these shells can give birth to a grb .",
    "to describe this process in a quantitative way , we first study the collision between two specific ( but typical ) shells .",
    "we assume @xmath285 .",
    "we further assume that the second shell is ejected after a time interval of @xmath286 ms .",
    "it is then straightforward to find that they will collide at a radius of @xmath287 cm , and at the time of @xmath288 s. note that due to relativistic effect , the observed elapsed time since the beginning of the phase transition is only @xmath289 ms .",
    "the merged shell will move at a lorentz factor of @xmath290 , with the co - moving internal energy characterized by @xmath291 .",
    "the efficiency of transferring the bulk kinetic energy into internal energy is @xmath292 .",
    "the pulse will have a width of @xmath293 ms .",
    "in realistic cases , the shells are ejected with variable masses , variable lorentz factors , and variable time intervals , respectively .",
    "the conditions then become very complicated . for example , if @xmath262 is much larger than @xmath259 ( @xmath294 , but we still assume @xmath295 ) , then the solution can be expressed as @xmath296 , @xmath297 , @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 . in this case , the pulse width will be very small . on the other hand , if @xmath262 is only slightly larger than @xmath259 ( still with @xmath295 ) , then @xmath301 and @xmath302 will be very large so that a pulse much wider than @xmath260 can be generated . however , in this case , the energy transfer efficiency will be extremely low ( @xmath303 ) for this single pulse .    in the standard fireball model , it is generally believed that the total duration of a grb reflects the active period of the central engine . in our simulations ,",
    "the shells are ejected mainly in a few * hundred * milliseconds .",
    "so , this mechanism is most proper for explaining short grbs .",
    "the duration may reasonably range between a few ms and several * hundred * ms if the neutrino emission and the mass ejection are the only processes to damp out the stellar oscillations .",
    "it is also possible for the duration to extent to more than 1 s. for example , if we take @xmath304 and @xmath305 ms , then the observed elapsed time for this pulse will be larger than @xmath306 s. note that the total isotropic energy of the shells can be @xmath253  @xmath252 ergs , and this is also consistent with the energy requirement of most short grbs .",
    "if some extent of anisotropy exists in the process ( which is quite possible if the effects of strong magnetic field of the compact star are further included , see the discussion in the last paragraph of this section ) , then the energy release can even meet the requirement of those rigorous energetic events , such as grb 051221a @xcite .",
    "also , as noted above , if two shells are ejected with similar lorentz factors , they may collide at a very late time .",
    "we further notice from tables 1  4 that there are many high energy shells that moves at trans - relativistic speeds ( with lorentz factors significantly less than @xmath243 ) .",
    "late collisions can also be produced by these energetic shells when they finally catch up with the decelerating external shock ( that produces grb afterglow ) .",
    "such late collisions may manifest themselves as flaring activities ( emerged in the afterglow phase ) , as frequently observed 1000  10000 s after the trigger of grbs @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "the shells are ejected periodically , with a period of @xmath307 ms .",
    "however , it is quite unlikely that we could observe any obvious periodicity in the @xmath250-ray light curve .",
    "the reason is that the shells have different masses , velocities , and energies .",
    "the periodicity will then be most likely smeared out at the time of collision .",
    "the energy releases in our simulations are basically isotropic .",
    "the reason is that we did not include the effects of rotation and macroscopical magnetic field in our calculations .",
    "when these effects are considered , the energy releases should show some features of anisotropy .",
    "this is an interesting point that needs to be investigated in further details .",
    "in this paper we have studied the possible consequences of the phase - induced collapse of neutron stars to hybrid stars .",
    "we have found that both the density and the temperature inside the star will oscillate with the same period , but almost 180@xmath0 out of phase , which will result in the emission of intense pulsating neutrinos .",
    "the temperatures at the peaks of pulsating neutrino fluxes are 10 - 20 mev , which are 2 - 3 times higher than non - oscillating case .",
    "since the electron / positron pair creation rate sensitively depends on the temperature at neutrinosphere , the efficiency of pair creation increases dramatically .",
    "we want to point out that the intense pulse neutrino and pair luminosity can be maintained due to the oscillatory fluid motion , which can carry thermal energy directly from the stellar core to the surface .",
    "this process can replenish the energy loss of neutrino emission much quicker than the neutrino diffusion process .",
    "part of neutrino energy , roughly ( 1 - 1/@xmath308 ) , and pairs inside the star will be absorbed by the matter very near the stellar surface .",
    "when this amount of energy exceeds the gravitational binding energy of matter , some mass near the stellar surface will be ejected , and this mass will be further accelerated by absorbing pairs created from the neutrino and antineutrino annihilation processes outside the star . unlike inside the star , the surface properties ,",
    "e.g. position of the neutrinosphere , surface temperature etc .",
    ", are very sensitive to the surface perturbation .",
    "the neutrino and pair luminosities can be varied from pulse to pulse .",
    "this results in the large variation of the lorentz factor of the mass ejecta .",
    "the internal collisions among these mass ejecta may produce the short time variabilities of the gamma - ray bursts , which can be as short as submilliseconds .",
    "although mass ejecta are ejected periodically , each ejecta can have different masses and lorentz factors as explained before .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic period could not be observed .",
    "although we can only simulate the oscillating stars for a few millisecond , we can speculate that this may be a possible mechanism for short gamma - ray bursts based on the following reasons .",
    "@xcite have estimated that the viscous damping time for such oscillating system is of order of 10 s. by assuming that if neutrinos and pair emissions are the only damping mechanisms , the pulsations can last less than @xmath309 @xcite , which is roughly the characteristic time scale of short gamma - ray bursts .    the phase - transition from a neutron star to a strange star",
    "was simulated in @xcite , with the conclusion that this process is most likely not a gamma - ray burst mechanism .",
    "they mimic the phase - transition by the arbitrary motion of a piston deep within the star , and they have found that the mechanic wave will eject @xmath310 baryons , which causes the baryon contamination for the gamma - ray bursts . in our simulations , we assume a sudden change of equation of state to mimic the phase - transition , and we use the newtonian hydrodynamic code to study the response of the stellar interior , after such a sudden change of the eos . in our simulations we find that the mass ejection by the motion of the fluid is very small .",
    "we estimate that the major mass ejection would result from the heating of neutrinos and pairs on the stellar crust , which is not modeled in the simulations .",
    "our total energy output and total mass in ejecta are close to that of @xcite ( cf .",
    "tables 1 - 4 )",
    ". however , the neutrino energy injection is pulsating , and hence the mass ejection is also pulsating .",
    "the masses of individual ejecta range from @xmath311 to @xmath312 , with output energy in the range of @xmath78 ergs to @xmath253 ergs .",
    "therefore , some ejecta can not be relativistic , and they can not contribute to grbs . however , there are still many relativistic ejecta in each simulation model , which can have lorentz factors @xmath313100 , and with a total energy of @xmath314  @xmath252 ergs .",
    "we conclude that this could be a possible mechanism for short grbs",
    ".    finally , we want to remark that our numerical simulations describe a spherically symmetric , non - rotating , and collapsing stellar object .",
    "also the effect of the magnetic fields was not taken into account .",
    "therefore , the radiation emission produced in this model is isotropic .",

    "<S> we study the dynamical evolution of a phase - transition - induced collapse neutron star to a hybrid star , which consists of a mixture of hadronic matter and strange quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the collapse is triggered by a sudden change of equation of state , which result in a large amplitude stellar oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the system is simulated by using a 3d newtonian hydrodynamic code with a high resolution shock capture scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the temperature and the density at the neutrinosphere are oscillating with acoustic frequency . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are nearly 180@xmath0 out of phase . consequently , extremely intense , pulsating neutrino / antineutrino fluxes will be emitted periodically . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy and density of neutrinos at the peaks of the pulsating fluxes are much higher than the non - oscillating case , the electron / positron pair creation rate can be enhanced dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> some mass layers on the stellar surface can be ejected by absorbing energy of neutrinos and pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these mass ejecta can be further accelerated to relativistic speeds by absorbing electron / positron pairs , created by the neutrino and antineutrino annihilation outside the stellar surface . </S>",
    "<S> the possible connection between this process and the cosmological gamma - ray bursts is discussed .    * keywords * : dense matter : stars : neutron stars : stellar oscillations : phase transition- quark stars : gamma ray bursts . </S>"
