    "<S> * in systems with broken inversion symmetry spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) yields a rashba - type spin splitting of electronic states , manifested in a kdependent splitting of the bands . </S>",

    "<S> a concomitant shift in the te - sublattice is inducing an almost perfect collective feorder , up to @xmath892% oriented along the @xmath7  direction perpendicular to the sample surface ( si .2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting symmetry breaking inside the @xmath0gete(111 )  triple - layers is responsible for the bulk rashba - splitting . of importance for the surfacesensitive uvsarpes on unpoled samples </S>",
    "<S> is that the spontaneous polarization of fe domains persist in the subsurface region , as this ensures a net spin polarization also for the bulk states ( si .3 ) . due to the small probing depth of arpes , measured energy- , angle- and spin - resolved spectra can hardly be compared directly with a calculated bandstructure because photoemission intensities do not relate directly to dispersions of bare bands . </S>",
    "<S> the task to describe the surface electronic structure differs from that in the bulk in several ways . due to </S>",
    "<S> the broken crystal symmetry the bulk spin - resolved band - structure calculations is different compared to a semi - infinite surface [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the star - like feature in a constant energy map ( cem ) from bulk initial states orients along @xmath9 , whereas surface - like initial states orient along @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for certain binding energies and momenta , the canted spin of the bulk states is opposite to what is predicted for surface states with rather tangential helicity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , mixing the spectral weights from surface and bulk states inevitably result in a competition of spin textures between bulk and surface states which in our case facilitate their discrimination in a spin - resolved experiment . since arpes data critically depend on photoemission final states , to build a bridge between sarpes and theoretical bandstructure calculations we use so - called onestep photoemission model ( 1sm , see methods ) . in this most rigorous interpretation besides bulk states also surface evanescent ( ss ) and surface - bulk - resonance ( sbr ) states are considered . to better understand their spectral weights </S>",

    "<S> the ss / sbr and sbr / bulk transitions appear gradually , but as a whole the sbr is the primary spectral weight dispersing across the gap , forming metallic states at @xmath11 , and degenerating with bulk rashba bands at lower binding energies ( @xmath12 ) .    </S>",
