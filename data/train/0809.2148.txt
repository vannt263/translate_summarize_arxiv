    "ognitive radio ( cr ) , since the name was coined by mitola in his seminal work @xcite , has drawn intensive attentions from both academic and industrial communities .",
    "generally speaking , there are three basic operation models for crs , namely , _ interweave _ , _ overlay _ , and _ underlay _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the interweave method is also known as _ opportunistic spectrum access _ ( osa ) , originally outlined in @xcite and later introduced by darpa , where the cr is allowed to transmit over the spectrum allocated to an existing primary radio ( pr ) system only when all pr transmissions are detected to be off . in contrast to interweave , the overlay and underlay methods allow the cr to transmit concurrently with prs at the same frequency .",
    "the overlay method utilizes an interesting `` cognitive relay '' idea @xcite , @xcite . for this method",
    ", the cr transmitter is assumed to know perfectly all the channels in the coexisting pr and cr links , as well as the pr messages to be sent .",
    "thereby , the cr transmitter is able to forward pr messages to the pr receivers so as to compensate for the interference due to its own messages sent concurrently to the cr receiver . in comparison with overlay ,",
    "the underlay method requires only the channel gain knowledge from the cr transmitter to the pr receivers , whereby the cr is permitted to transmit regardless of the on / off status of pr transmissions provided that its resulted signal power levels at all pr receivers are kept below some predefined threshold , also known as the _ interference - temperature _ constraint @xcite , @xcite . from implementation viewpoints , interweave and underlay methods could be more favorable than overlay for practical cr systems .    in a wireless environment",
    ", channels are usually subject to space - time - frequency variation ( fading ) due to multipath propagation , mobility , and location - dependent shadowing . as such , _ dynamic resource allocation _ ( dra ) becomes crucial to crs for optimally deploying their transmit strategies , where the transmit power , bit - rate , bandwidth , and antenna beam are dynamically allocated based upon the channel state information ( csi ) of the pr and cr systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) . in this paper , we are particularly interested in the case where the cr terminal is equipped with multi - antennas so that it can deploy joint transmit precoding and power control , namely _ cognitive beamforming _",
    "( cb ) , to effectively balance between avoiding interference at the pr terminals and optimizing performance of the cr link . in @xcite ,",
    "various cb schemes have been proposed considering the cr transmit power constraint and a set of interference power constraints at the pr terminals , under the assumption that the cr transmitter knows perfectly all the channels over which it interferes with pr terminals . in this work , however , we propose a _ practical _",
    "cb scheme , which does not require any prior knowledge of the cr - to - pr channels . instead , by exploiting the time - division - duplex ( tdd ) operation mode of the pr link and the channel reciprocities between the cr and pr terminals ,",
    "the proposed cb scheme utilizes a new idea so - called _ effective interference channel _ ( eic ) , which can be efficiently estimated at the cr terminal via periodically observing the pr transmissions .",
    "thereby , the proposed learning - based cb scheme eliminates the overhead for pr terminals to estimate the cr - to - pr channels and then feed them back to the cr , and thus makes the cb implementable in practical systems .",
    "furthermore , the proposed learning - based cb scheme with the eic creates a new operation model for crs , where the cr is able to transmit with prs at the same time and frequency over the detected available spatial dimensions , thus named as _ opportunistic spatial sharing _ ( oss ) . on the one hand ,",
    "oss , like the underlay method , utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than the interweave method by allowing the cr to transmit concurrently with prs . on the other hand",
    ", oss can further improve the cr transmit spectral efficiency over the underlay method by exploiting additional side information on pr transmissions , which is extractable from the observed eic ( more details will be given later in this paper ) . therefore , oss is a more superior operation model for crs than both underlay and interweave methods in terms of the spectrum utilization efficiency .",
    "the main results of this paper constitute two parts , which are summarized as follows :    * first , we consider the ideal case where the cr s estimate on the eic is _ perfect _ or noiseless .",
    "for this case , we derive the conditions under which the eic is sufficient for the proposed cb scheme to cause no adverse effects on the concurrent pr transmissions .",
    "in addition , we show that when the pr link is equipped with multi - antennas but only communicates over a subspace of the total available spatial dimensions , the learning - based cb scheme with the eic leads to a capacity gain over the conventional zero - forcing ( zf ) scheme @xcite even with the exact cr - to - pr channel knowledge , via exploiting side information on pr transmit dimensions extracted from the eic . *",
    "second , we consider the practical case with _",
    "imperfect _ estimation of eic due to finite learning time .",
    "we propose a _ two - phase _",
    "protocol for crs to implement learning - based cb .",
    "the first phase is for the cr to observe the pr signals and estimate the eic , while the second phase is for the cr to transmit data with cb designed via the estimated eic .",
    "we present two algorithms for crs to estimate the eic , under different assumptions on the availability of the noise power knowledge at the cr terminal . furthermore , due to imperfect channel estimation , the proposed cb scheme results in leakage interference at the pr terminals , which leads to an interesting _ learning - throughput tradeoff _ ,",
    "i.e. , different choices of time allocation between cr s channel learning and data transmission correspond to different tradeoffs between pr transmission protection and cr throughput maximization .",
    "we formulate the problem to determine the optimal time allocation for estimating the eic to maximize the effective throughput of the cr link , subject to the cr transmit power constraint and the interference power constraints at the pr terminals ; and derive the solution via applying convex optimization techniques .",

    "the cb designs in @xcite assume that in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] , cr - tx has perfect knowledge of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in this work",
    ", however , we remove the assumption on any prior knowledge of @xmath68 and @xmath69 at cr - tx for the design of cb , since in practice the cr and pr systems usually belong to different operators , and it is thus difficult to require prs to estimate cr - to - pr channels and then feed them back to the cr . as such , the most feasible method for the cr to learn some knowledge of cr - to - pr channels is to observe the pr signals propagating through pr - to - cr channels and then apply the channel reciprocities between cr - tx and pr@xmath49 s .",
    "thus , in this paper we propose a _ learning - based _ cr transmit strategy , where the cr first observes the received pr signals to extract cr - to - pr channel knowledge , and then designs the cb based upon the obtained channel knowledge .",
    "however , there are several issues related to this approach , which are pointed out as follows :    * what cr - tx can possibly estimate are indeed the `` effective '' channels , @xmath70 , from pr@xmath49 , @xmath50 , instead of the actual channels , @xmath71 s , if the pr transmit beamforming matrices , @xmath55 s , are not known at cr - tx . *",
    "the proposed cb schemes in @xcite require that the channels associated with @xmath68 and @xmath69 be separately estimated at cr - tx .",
    "as such , cr - tx needs to synchronize with pr tdd transmissions , which requires knowledge of the exact time instants over each transmit direction between pr@xmath38 and pr@xmath39 . *",
    "if cr - tx designs @xmath65 based on the effective channels , @xmath70 s , it is unclear whether the effect of its resulted interference at pr@xmath49 s can be properly controlled since the signals from cr - tx interferer with pr@xmath49 via the equivalent channel , @xmath72 , which can be different from @xmath73 if the pr receive beamforming matrix @xmath59 differs from @xmath55 .    therefore , to make the learning - based cb feasible for practical systems ,",
    "the above issues need to be carefully addressed , without critical assumptions or prior knowledge on pr signal processing procedures . in this paper",
    ", we propose an effective solution to resolve the aforementioned issues , while utilizes a new idea , namely _ effective interference channel _ ( eic ) , as will be presented next .",
    "for the learning - based cb scheme , suppose that prior to data transmission , cr - tx first listens to the frequency band of interest for pr transmissions over @xmath74 symbol periods .",
    "the received baseband signals can then be represented as @xmath75 where @xmath76 if @xmath77 , and @xmath78 if @xmath79 , with @xmath80 denoting the time instants when pr@xmath38 transmits to pr@xmath39 and pr@xmath39 transmits to pr@xmath38 , respectively , and @xmath81 due to the assumed tdd mode ; @xmath82 s are the encoded signals ( prior to power control and precoding ) for the corresponding pr@xmath49 , and for convenience it is assumed that @xmath82 s are independent over @xmath83 s and @xmath84={\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ i $ } } } _ { d_j\\times d_j}$ ] , @xmath50 ; @xmath85 s are the additive noises assumed to be independent cscg random vectors with zero - mean and covariance matrix denoted by @xmath86 .",

    "if @xmath93 , there will be no active pr transmissions in the observed frequency band .",
    "define @xmath94 as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , if @xmath97 and @xmath98 otherwise .",

    "note that @xmath116 should be a covariance matrix and hence @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "next , we denote the aggregate `` effective '' channel from both pr@xmath49 s to cr - tx as @xmath119 while under the assumption of channel reciprocity , we denote the _ effective interference channel _ ( eic ) from cr - tx to both pr@xmath49 s as @xmath120 .    in the rest of this paper ,",
    "cb schemes based on the eic instead of the actual cr - to - pr channels will be studied .",
    "note that with the eic , the first two items of implementation issues raised in section [ sec : system model ] are resolved .",
    "the first issue is resolved since the eic is defined over the effective channels from pr@xmath49 s to cr - tx instead of the actual channels , while the second issue is resolved since the eic does not attempt to separate the two channels from pr@xmath49 s to cr - tx , and thus synchronization for cr - tx with each transmit direction between pr@xmath38 and pr@xmath39 is no longer required .",
    "however , we still need to address the third issue on analyzing the effect of the cr s interference on the pr transmissions with the eic - based cb design .",
    "we will first address this issue for the ideal case where the estimation of @xmath120 is perfect or noiseless in section [ sec : beamforming ] , in order to gain some insights into this problem .",
    "then , we will study this problem for the more practical case where @xmath120 is imperfectly estimated due to finite values of @xmath74 in section [ sec : tradeoff ] .",
    "in this section , we design the cr transmit covariance matrix , @xmath65 , in terms of the equivalent transmit beamforming matrix , @xmath121 , which contains information of both transmit precoding and power allocation at cr - tx , under perfect learning of the eic , i.e. , the noise effect on estimating @xmath114 from @xmath115 is completely removed . for this case , @xmath122 in ( [ eq : effective channel ] ) , and from ( [ eq : pr signal covariance matrix ] ) it follows that the eic can now be expressed as @xmath123 from ( [ eq : eic ideal case ] ) , due to independence of the channels @xmath68 and @xmath69 , it follows that @xmath124 .",
    "thus , if the number of antennas at cr - tx , @xmath40 , is strictly greater than the total number of transmit data streams between pr@xmath38 and pr@xmath39 , @xmath125 , then the eic - based cb design will have at most @xmath126 number of spatial dimensions or degrees of freedom ( dof ) @xcite for transmission , where all these dimensions lie in the null space of @xmath120 .",
    "based on this observation , we obtain the following proposition :    [ proposition:1 ] under perfect learning of the eic , if the conditions @xmath127 hold , means that for two given matrices with the same collum size , @xmath2 and @xmath128 , if @xmath129 for any arbitrary vector @xmath130 , then @xmath131 must hold . ] then the eic - based cb design satisfying the constraint @xmath132 will have no adverse effects on pr transmissions , i.e. , @xmath133 .",
    "the conditions in the above proposition can also be expressed as @xmath134 , @xmath50 , where @xmath135 denotes the subspace spanned by the row vectors in @xmath136 .",
    "intuitively speaking , these conditions hold when the transmit signal space of pr@xmath49 after propagating through the pr - to - cr channel @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138 , if being reversed ( conjugate transposed ) , will subsume the equivalent channel from cr - tx to pr@xmath49 , @xmath139 , as a subspace , for both @xmath50 . note that @xmath73 and @xmath72 may not have the same column size , and @xmath140 and @xmath59 may differ from each other for any @xmath50 . as such , the validity of these conditions needs to be examined for practical systems .",
    "thus , before we proceed to the proof of proposition [ proposition:1 ] , we present two typical examples of multi - antenna transmission schemes for the pr link as follows , for both of which the conditions @xmath127 are usually satisfied .",
    "are not satisfied , the proposed cb scheme will cause certain performance loss to pr transmissions even under perfect channel learning . ]    _ spatial multiplexing _ : when the pr csi is unknown at transmitter but known at receiver , the spatial multiplexing mode is usually adopted to assign equal powers and rates to transmit antennas ( e.g. , the v - blast scheme @xcite ) . for this case , the transmit covariance matrix at pr@xmath49 , @xmath50 , reduces to @xmath141 , with @xmath142 denoting the transmit power of pr@xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath143 , and @xmath55 s are both scaled identity matrices .",
    "it then follows that @xmath144 holds regardless of @xmath59 .",

    "at a first glance , this result is counter - intuitive since @xmath120 contains only partial information on @xmath71 s .",

    "note that this dof gain is achieved by the cr via exploiting side information on pr transmit ( on / off ) status or signal dimensions extracted from the observed eic .",
