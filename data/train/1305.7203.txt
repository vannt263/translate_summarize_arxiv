    "one of the most fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics has been the understanding of topologically ordered states of matter.@xcite topologically ordered states are gapped many - body states that possess quasiparticle excitations with fractional statistics and fractional charges , topology - dependent ground state degeneracies , different patterns of long - range entanglement@xcite , and many other exotic characteristics .",
    "the most common topological states seen experimentally are the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states .",
    "there is also increasing support from numerical simulations and experiments@xcite that topologically ordered states are found in frustrated magnets .",
    "topological order.@xcite [ fig : genon ] , width=220 ]    recently , a new direction in the study of topologically ordered states , called twist defects , or extrinsic defects , has attracted increasing research interest.@xcite an extrinsic defect is a point - like or line - like defect either in a topological state , or on the interface between two topologically distinct states , which leads to new topological properties that are absent in the topological state without the defect .",
    "a crucial distinction between extrinsic defects and the more familiar quasiparticle excitations is that the former are not deconfined excitations of the system ; rather , the energy cost for separating point defects , for instance , will generally depend either logarithmically or linearly on their separation .",
    "a simple example of an extrinsic defect is the  genon \" defined in ref . .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : genon ] , a branch - cut line is introduced in a bilayer topological state , across which the two layers are exchanged.@xcite the genon in this case is defined as the branch - cut point where the branch - cut line ends . from its definition",
    "one can see that a bilayer system with genons is topologically equivalent to a single layer system on a riemann surface.@xcite using such a mapping , the topological properties of genons such as quantum dimension and ( projective ) braiding statistics can be studied systematically.@xcite even when the topological state in each layer is an abelian theory , the genons have non - abelian statistics . this has led to a recent experimental proposal for synthesizing a wide variety of possible topological qubits using the simplest abelian bilayer fqh states.@xcite it has also been shown that the braiding statistics of genons can allow for universal topological quantum computation ( tqc ) even in cases where the host topological state without the genons is not by itself universal for tqc.@xcite    extrinsic defects with the same type of non - abelian statistics as some of the genons studied in ref .",
    "have also been proposed in other physical systems .",
    "these include lattice defects in certain exactly solvable @xmath0 rotor models,@xcite fqh states in proximity with superconductivity ( sc ) , and fractional quantum spin hall ( fqsh ) states in proximity with sc and ferromagnetism ( fm ) .",
    "@xcite the latter fqsh proposals are generalizations of earlier proposals of realizing majorana zero modes on the boundary of the quantum spin hall insulator@xcite . in these fqsh realizations ,",
    "the extrinsic defect is a point on the boundary of the system where the boundary condition changes , while the rest of the boundary is in a gapped state . for abelian states ,",
    "the extrinsic defects realized in the superconducting proximity proposals reviewed above can be mapped to genons in suitable bilayer abelian states@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a general theory of extrinsic defects in abelian topological states , which generalize the extrinsic defects reviewed above to the most generic possible form . for two - dimensional topological states ,",
    "there are two general forms of extrinsic defects .",
    "these are line defects , which separate two different or identical topological states , and point defects , which may live in a topological state ( such as genons ) or live on line defects ( such as the fm / sc domain wall on the fqsh edge ) .",
    "we demonstrate that all extrinsic defects can be mapped to _ boundary defects _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , boundary lines of topological states with point defects separating different boundary regions .",
    "generically , the boundary lines may be gapped or gapless .",
    "the gapped cases are of interest for us since they support point defects that have nontrivial topological properties .",
    "we prove a classification of topologically distinct line defects of general abelian topological states , extending the results of previous works@xcite .",
    "in particular , it was proven recently in ref . that a gapped boundary in an abelian state is determined by a",
    " lagrangian subgroup \" which consists of certain maximal subsets of topological quasi - particles that have trivial self and mutual statistics . in this paper",
    ", we prove that _ every such lagrangian subgroup corresponds to a topologically distinct gapped edge , and that lagrangian subgroups therefore provide a classification of topologically distinct gapped edges .",
    "assuming that the notion of topological boundary conditions studied in ref .",
    "is equivalent to gapped boundaries of local hamiltonians , this proves the classification that was conjectured in ref . .",
    "our proof is constructive , in the sense that given an arbitrary lagrangian subgroup @xmath1 , we show explicitly what _ local operators to add to the edge theory to gap the edge in a way that corresponds to @xmath1 . _ _",
    "we further show that the nontrivial point defects on the boundary are then classified by the domain wall between gapped edges corresponding to different lagrangian subgroups .",
    "we compute the quantum dimension for generic point defects , which demonstrates that the point defects are non - abelian , and we develop an understanding of the zero modes that are topologically localized to the point defects .",
    "these `` generalized parafermion '' zero modes vastly generalize the well - known majorana fermion zero modes that are currently under intense theoretical and experimental investigation.@xcite although it is generally not possible to geometrically braid the point defects that live on the boundary , we demonstrate that effective  braiding \" operations can be realized in general by quasi - particle tunneling processes between pairs of defects .",
    "such braiding operations are topologically robust unitary transformations of the topologically degenerate states .",
    "we show that they can always be mapped to the braiding of genons in a bilayer system .",
    "we also studied the quantum phase transitions between different gapped boundary states realized on the same line defect .",
    "interestingly , the transition between two different types of boundary states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , corresponding to two different lagrangian subgroups , can be realized by nucleation of a periodic array of @xmath2 regions in @xmath1 .",
    "the domain walls between @xmath1 and @xmath2 regions define a periodic array of lattice defects , each of which supports non - abelian zero modes .",
    "this approach allows us to describe the quantum phase transition by a quantum spin chain that characterizes the coupling between the topological zero modes .",
    "alternatively , the spin chain can be formulated as a `` generalized parafermion chain , '' and we expect that their phase transitions may be described by generalized parafermion conformal field theories .",
    "we would like to further clarify the relation of our work with some previous works in the literature .",
    "gapped edges have been considered in recent years in several works .",
    "ref . constructed a set of gapped edges for quantum double models , which are microscopic models of topologically ordered states described at low energies by an emergent discrete gauge theory .",
    "these are restricted to time - reversal invariant bosonic systems .",
    "it is not clear whether that construction provides a complete classification of all possible gapped edges for those models .",
    "subsequently , ref . developed a systematic microscopic analysis of gapped edges for a class of exactly soluble bosonic lattice models  the levin - wen models@xcite  which pertain to both abelian and non - abelian states of time - reversal and parity symmetric bosonic systems .",

    "as pointed out in ref . , it is not clear whether topological boundary conditions are equivalent to gapped boundaries of local hamiltonians ; ref",
    ". further proved that the existence of a lagrangian subgroup is a necessary and sufficient condition for when an abelian topological phase of bosons or fermions , realized by a local hamiltonian , can possibly admit a gapped edge .",
    "ref . also studied topological boundary conditions in topological quantum field theories ( tqfts ) from a mathematical point of view , utilizing the framework of category theory .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that it is not clear whether the topological boundary conditions of tqfts that are classified in ref .",
    "are equivalent to gapped edges of local hamiltonians , which are the focus of this paper and of ref . .",

    "general topologically ordered states in 2 + 1 dimensions are characterized by the topological properties of a set of topologically non - trivial quasiparticle excitations , @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of quasiparticles .",
    "when two quasiparticles are observed from far away , they in general behave like a superposition of single quasiparticle states .",

    "the topologically non - trivial quasiparticles are described by integer vectors @xmath28 , where two integer vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 describe topologically equivalent quasiparticles if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an integer vector .",
    "therefore the integer lattice in @xmath32 dimensions , modulo this equivalence relation , defines a discrete group consisting of the quasiparticles , with the number of topologically distinct quasiparticles given by @xmath33 .",

    "if all diagonal elements of @xmath23 are even integers ( referred to as @xmath23 being even ) , then all local particles are bosons , and the theory describes a topological phase of bosons ; otherwise we say @xmath23 is odd , and the microscopic degrees of freedom must contain fermions ( possibly in addition to bosons ) .",
    "different @xmath23-matrices can specify equivalent topological states if they have the same quasiparticle content .",

    "the lagrangian ( [ edgel ] ) is gapless .",
    "when an abelian topological state admits a gapped edge , it can be obtained by adding additional backscattering terms in ( [ edgel ] ) to generate an energy gap in the edge theory .",

    "the topological phases @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not necessarily have to be distinct : if @xmath56 , there can still be many different kinds of line defects . these correspond to situations where quasiparticles are permuted amongst themselves as they cross the boundary , in a way which preserves their topological quantum numbers.@xcite such line defects are `` invisible , '' in the sense that braiding and fusion of quasiparticles on either side of the line defect yields the same results .    in order to understand the properties of general boundaries ,",
    "it is helpful to apply a folding process , which has been employed previously in ref . , and which we review here . in order to understand the boundary between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for concreteness we can consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 on a sphere , or plane , and",

    "therefore , to study line defects , it suffices to consider all possible boundaries between generic topological phases and the trivial gapped phase .",
    "given the possibility of different kinds of gapped edges between topological phases , it is also possible to have domain walls and junctions between them ( see fig .",

    "[ pointfig]b ) , then we may apply the folding , in conjunction with deformations of the location of the edges , several times in order to map the original configuration onto a domain wall between different gapped edges separating a topological phase and @xmath18 .",
    "we note that this folding does not directly apply if the whole system is on a spatial manifold of arbitrary topology , or for arbitrary configurations of point defects , but it is useful to understand the topological behavior of each point defect by considering it in isolation on a plane , and then applying the folding process .",
    "therefore , in what follows we need only focus on gapped boundaries between a generic abelian topological phase and the trivial phase @xmath18 , and domain walls between different such gapped boundaries .",

    "the interactions between the edges and domain walls can be used to realize topologically protected unitary transformations on the ground state subspace .",
    "the overall phase of these transformations is not topologically protected , which is why it is referred to as _ projective non - abelian braiding statistics . by studying the action of this `` braiding '' on the wilson line operators that define the ground state subspace",
    ", we found that the projective non - abelian statistics can be understood in terms of dehn twists , or modular transformations , of the corresponding abelian cs theory on the high genus surface , generalizing earlier results.@xcite",
    "_    for bosonic topologically ordered states , the topological zero modes occur only at domain walls between gapped edges associated with different lagrangian subgroups .",
    "therefore for bosons , in the absence of any symmetries , we expect that lagrangian subgroups fully classify the topologically distinct gapped edges .    for fermionic states , due to the possibility of majorana zero modes protected by fermion parity symmetry in one - dimension , two gapped edges can be topologically distinct even if they correspond to the same lagrangian subgroup .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian subgroups classify gapped edges of fermionic systems , up to this additional @xmath262 topological classification arising from purely one - dimensional physics .    finally , we pointed out that the critical phenomena between topologically distinct gapped edges can be understood in terms of a generalized quantum spin chain or , equivalently , a generalized parafermion chain .",

    "can both be integer if and only if @xmath545 has unit determinant .",
    "since @xmath545 is an even symmetric integer matrix with vanishing signature and unit determinant , it follows from a mathematical theorem @xcite that it is always possible to find a @xmath551 transformation @xmath40 such that @xmath552 where @xmath553 is an @xmath237 identity matrix .",
