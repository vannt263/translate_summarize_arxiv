    "since the development of ultrafast lasers , numerous studies have been devoted to elucidating the photoexcited carrier dynamics by using nonlinear laser spectroscopic techniques such as optical pump and optical probe spectroscopy , four wave mixing , and transient gratings  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved photo - luminescence has also been used to investigate hot carrier relaxation and exciton formation  @xcite . with the development of mid - infrared ultrafast light sources ,",
    "the wavelength of the optical probe has been extended to the lower energy region and it has become possible to access the intraband transitions , i.e. , the free carrier responses , or the intra - exciton transitions with sub - ps temporal resolution . as such , the mid - infrared probe method has been used to study , e.g. , electron - hole ( e - h ) droplet formation in cucl  @xcite and conversion dynamics of orthoexcitons to paraexctions in cu@xmath0o  @xcite .",
    "the advent of terahertz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) has enabled researchers to investigate the lower end of the terahertz frequency range  @xcite .",
    "unlike optical methods , thz - tds enables the determination of the complex optical conductivity from which one can quantitatively evaluate the carrier density and the scattering time of the photoexcited carriers @xcite , without resorting to the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "the technique has been used to investigate the buildup of plasma screening in a high - density e - h system in gaas  @xcite and formation of excitons in gaas quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "carrier dynamics in indirect gap semiconductors , in particular in si , has also been extensively studied .",
    "near - infrared and visible pump - probe studies  @xcite , and more recently time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite , have revealed the ultrafast dynamics of hot carrier relaxation at very high carrier densities ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the photoexcited dynamics at lower carrier density in si is not fully understood yet , despite their inevitable importance in optoelectronic applications . from the viewpoint of many - body quantum phenomena in e - h systems ,",
    "an unambiguous understanding of the cooling dynamics of the photoexcited e - h system will be crucial for the realization of theoretically predicted low - temperature quantum degenerate phases such as exciton bose - einstein condensation and the e - h bcs state  @xcite . a quantitative description on the slow formation time of excitons on the order of several hundreds of ps , as observed in our previous study  @xcite ,",
    "is also needed for gaining an understanding of the fundamental optical properties of si .",
    "the current study addressed the carrier thermalization dynamics of photoexcited e - h system in si and the slow formation dynamics of excitons by using optical pump and thz probe measurements .",
    "we evaluated the time - dependent fraction of free carriers and excitons from the spectral shape analysis of the complex optical conductivity in the terahertz frequency range and estimated the effective carrier temperature by using the saha equation .",
    "this analysis was partly motivated by the scheme reported by kaindl et al .",
    "the cooling dynamics of the carrier system was analyzed numerically by calculating all the relevant phonon relaxation rates .",
    "the observed cooling rate was quantitatively reproduced without adjustable parameters .",
    "accordingly , the observed long formation time of excitons in si after above - gap photoexcitation was well accounted for by the carrier thermalization dynamics dominated by electron ( hole ) - phonon scattering .",
    "we used the optical pump and thz probe technique to study the transient photoexcited free carrier responses and to investigate the formation dynamics of excitons through the observation of the 1s-2p transition around 12 mev ( @xmath33 thz )  @xcite .",
    "the output from a multi - pass amplifier seeded by a 14-fs mode - locked ti : sapphire oscillator was used as a light source .",
    "the duration of the amplified pulse was 30 fs with the repetition rate of 1 khz , and the center wavelength was 800 nm ( 1.55 ev ) .",
    "the output from the amplifier was divided into three beams , respectively for thz generation , thz detection , and the optical pump .",
    "the thz probe pulse was generated from a 300 @xmath4 m thick gap(110 ) crystal by optical rectification of the laser pulse .",
    "the waveforms of the thz pulse transmitted after the sample with and without the optical pump were recorded by electro - optic sampling with a 300 @xmath4 m gap crystal  @xcite .",
    "the complex transmittance change was then obtained by fourier transformation , thereby yielding a photo - induced change in the complex dielectric function , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the change in the real part of the optical conductivity .",
    "the frequency range of our experimental setup was between 0.5 thz ( 2 mev ) to 6 thz ( 25 mev ) . to make a homogeneous optical excitation in the lateral direction ,",
    "the sample was irradiated with a pump pulse with a spot size of 3 mm in diameter , which was larger than the thz - probe spot size of d=4@xmath7 ( @xmath7 ranged from 0.05 mm ( 6 thz ) to 0.6 mm ( 0.5 thz ) ) in our experimental setup .    as a sample",
    ", we used a high purity and high resistivity ( 10 k@xmath8 cm at room temperature ) si single crystal with an optically flat ( 001 ) surface . to achieve a nearly homogeneous optical excitation in the depth direction , the sample was mechanically polished to a thickness of 22 @xmath4 m , which was smaller than the penetration depth of 27 @xmath4 m at 1.5 ev",

    "[ ex_form ] ( a ) ) .",
    "accordingly , the temporal decrease in @xmath21 can be attributed to the formation of excitons .",
    "it should be noted here that the lifetime of the indirect excitons in si is 1 @xmath4s  @xcite , so that the dynamics observed in the current temporal region is free from the lifetime effect .",
    "since it is considered that thermalization of the electron system occurs within 1 ps through the electron - electron collisions  @xcite , the observed long formation time of excitons can be presumably attributed to the thermal relaxation process of carriers in the lattice system . as shown in fig .",

    "these acoustic phonons with large wave number have high energy .",
    "when @xmath9 becomes low , the number of such high energy acoustic phonons becomes small .",
