    "one of the best opportunities for precision tests of flavour physics will be provided by the study of @xmath2 transitions , induced by interactions at very short distances .",
    "a measurement of the inclusive decay @xmath3 , ideal from a theory perspective , appears to be extremely challenging experimentally .",
    "more promising is the measurement of exclusive channels such as @xmath0 , @xmath4 . in this case",
    "a clean theoretical interpretation requires , however , the control of nonperturbative hadronic form factors . direct calculations of form factors suffer from sizable uncertainties .",
    "these can be greatly reduced through a combined analysis of the rare decays @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "this option allows us to construct precision observables for testing the standard model and for investigating new physics effects .",
    "in particular neither isospin nor @xmath6 flavour symmetry are required and form factor uncertainties can be eliminated to a large extent .",
    "a detailed study has recently been given in @xcite , where further details can be found .",
    "similar ideas had been considered independently in @xcite .    from experiment",
    "only upper limits are available for the branching ratios of the neutrino modes : @xcite @xmath7 the most accurate experimental results for @xmath1 are from belle @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated , non - resonant branching fraction is measured to be @xmath8 consistent with results from babar @xcite .",
    "the recent paper @xcite also contains information on the @xmath9-spectrum in terms of partial branching fractions for six separate bins .",
    "similar results from cdf were reported in @xcite .",
    "we define the kinematic quantities @xmath10 ( where @xmath9 is the dilepton invariant mass squared ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the differential branching fractions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 can then be written as @xmath15 @xmath16 the coefficient @xmath17 is given by a short - distance wilson coefficient at the weak scale , which is known very precisely .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 contains the wilson coefficient @xmath19 combined with the short - distance kernels of the @xmath14 matrix elements of four - quark operators evaluated at @xmath20 . the coefficient @xmath18 multiplies the local operator @xmath21 . at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "the result can be extracted from the expressions for the inclusive decay @xmath22 given in @xcite , where also the wilson coefficients and operators of the effective hamiltonian and further details can be found .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 is a short - distance quantity , which is precisely known , similarly to @xmath17 .",
    "the long - distance hadronic dynamics of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is contained in the matrix elements @xmath24\\,\\frac{m^2_b - m^2_k}{q^2}q^\\mu \\label{fpf0def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath25 \\label{ftdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are parametrized by the form factors @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath10 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath30 in ( [ fpf0def ] ) , and hence @xmath27 , drops out when the small lepton masses are neglected as has been done in ( [ dbknnds ] ) and ( [ dbkllds ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 is independent of unknown hadronic quantities in the small-@xmath32 region due to the relations between form factors that hold in the limit of large kaon energy @xcite @xmath33 here we have kept the kinematical dependence on @xmath34 in the asymptotic result .",
    "in contrast to @xmath26 the form factor @xmath28 is scale and scheme dependent .",
    "this dependence is of order @xmath35 and has been neglected in ( [ ftfp ] ) .",
    "we remark that the same result for @xmath31 is also obtained in the opposite limit where the final state kaon is soft , that is in the region of large @xmath36 @xcite . from this observation",
    "we expect ( [ ftfp ] ) to be a reasonable approximation in the entire physical domain .",
    "this is indeed borne out by a detailed analysis of qcd sum rules on the light cone @xcite , which cover a range in @xmath32 from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the impact of the @xmath31 term is numerically small , about @xmath39 of the amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "a @xmath40 uncertainty , which may be expected for the approximate result ( [ ftfp ] ) , will only imply an uncertainty of @xmath41 for @xmath18 or the @xmath42 differential rate . in practice , this leaves us with the form factor @xmath43 as the essential hadronic quantity for both @xmath13 and @xmath42 .",
    "we employ the parametrization proposed by becirevic and kaidalov @xcite in the form @xmath44 the parameter @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 @xmath45 represents the position of the @xmath47 pole and is taken as fixed , following @xcite .",
    "the remaining three quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are treated as variable parameters .",
    "qcd sum rules on the light cone ( lcsr ) give @xcite @xmath51 @xmath50 only affects the overall normalization of the decay rates and cancels in appropriate ratios .",
    "combining theoretical constraints @xcite , we adopt the following default ranges for the shape parameters @xmath52 with @xmath53 as our reference values .",
    "the latter are also obtained @xcite as the best fit to the shape of the measured @xmath42 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit ] .      in this section",
    "we comment on the theoretical framework for @xmath54 and on nonperturbative effects beyond those that are contained in the form factors .",
    "it is well known that , because of huge backgrounds from @xmath55 , the region of @xmath9 containing the two narrow charmonium states @xmath56 and @xmath57 has to be removed by experimental cuts from the @xmath9 spectrum of @xmath54 . the overwhelming background from @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "is related to a drastic failure of quark - hadron duality in the narrow - resonance region for the _ square _ of the charm - loop amplitude , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the parts of the @xmath9 spectrum below and above the narrow - resonance region remain under theoretical control and are sensitive to the flavour physics at short distances .",
    "a key observation here is that the amplitude is largely dominated by the semileptonic operators @xmath60 which have large coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these contributions are perturbatively calculable up to the long - distance physics contained in the form factor @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath14 matrix elements of four - quark operators , such as @xmath63 , are more complicated , but still systematically calculable .",
    "schematically , the @xmath14 rate is proportional to @xmath64 represents contributions from four - quark operators , for instance charm loops or weak annihilation effects are negligibly small , although they are a leading - power effect @xcite . ] . because @xmath65 is numerically subleading ( @xmath66 of the total rate )",
    ", the impact of any uncertainties in its evaluation will be suppressed .    in the _",
    "low-@xmath9 region _",
    "@xmath65 can be computed using qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "this approach , which is based on the heavy - quark limit and the large energy of the recoiling kaon , should work well for the real part of the amplitude in view of the experience from two - body hadronic @xmath67 decays @xcite and @xmath68 @xcite .    in the _ high-@xmath9 region _",
    "the appropriate theoretical framework for the computation of @xmath65 is an operator product expansion exploiting the presence of the large scale @xmath69 .",
    "this concept has been used in @xcite in analyzing the endpoint region of @xmath70 , which is governed by few - body exclusive modes .",
    "a detailed treatment , including the discussion of subleading corrections , has been given in @xcite .",
    "power corrections are generally smaller than for low @xmath9 .",
    "uncertainties could still come from violations of local quark - hadron duality .",
    "the relative amplitude of oscillations in @xmath71 may be estimated to be of order @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we expect these local variations to be averaged out when the spectrum is integrated over @xmath32 @xcite such that the residual uncertainty will be reduced .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , global duality in this sense can not be expected to hold for the second order term @xmath74 in ( [ c94qc10 ] ) . on the other hand , this contribution is numerically very small , at the level of few percent , and duality violations will only have a minor effect .",
    "the decay @xmath76 followed by @xmath77 produces a background for the short - distance reaction @xmath78 at the level of @xmath79-@xmath80 , which has been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "this background has to be taken into account for a precise measurement of the short - distance branching fraction @xmath81 .",
    "it needs to be subtracted from the experimental signal , but this should ultimately be possible with essentially negligible uncertainty @xcite .",
    "our predictions for the branching fractions in the standard model are @xmath82 @xmath83    whereas the individual branching fractions ( [ bnnnum ] ) and ( [ bllnum ] ) suffer from large hadronic uncertainties , we expect their ratio to be under much better theoretical control .",
    "it is obvious that the form factor normalization @xmath50 cancels in this ratio .",
    "moreover , the shape of the @xmath9 spectrum is almost identical for the two modes .",
    "this is because the additional @xmath9-dependence from charm loops in @xmath1 , compared to @xmath0 , is numerically only a small effect outside the region of the narrow charmonium states . as a consequence ,",
    "also the dependence on the form factor shape will be greatly reduced in the ratio @xmath84 numerically we find @xmath85 this prediction is independent of form factor uncertainties for all practical purposes .",
    "it is limited essentially by the perturbative uncertainty at nlo of @xmath86 . using the experimental result in ( [ kllexp ] ) , the theory prediction ( [ rnum ] ) , and assuming the validity of the standard model , we obtain @xmath87 with an accuracy of @xmath88 , limited at present by the experimental error , this result is currently the most precise estimate of @xmath81 .    in order to obtain theoretically clean observables , the region of the two narrow charmonium resonances @xmath89 and @xmath90 has to be removed from the @xmath9 spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "this leaves two regions of interest , the low-@xmath32 region below the resonances , and the high-@xmath32 region above . for the present analysis",
    "we define these ranges as @xmath91 the resonance region @xmath92 corresponds to the @xmath9 range @xmath93 . for",
    "our standard parameter set the total rate for @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( non - resonant ) is divided among the three regions , low-@xmath32 , narrow - resonance , high-@xmath32 , as @xmath94 .",
    "we first concentrate on the low-@xmath32 region , where @xmath95 can be reliably calculated . to ensure an optimal cancellation of the form factor dependence",
    ", one may restrict also the neutrino mode to the same range in @xmath32 and define @xmath96 this ratio is determined by theory to very high precision . displaying the sensitivity to the shape parameters and the renormalization scale",
    "one finds @xmath97 the form factor dependence is seen to cancel almost perfectly in @xmath98 .",
    "the shape parameters affect this quantity at a level of only 0.5 per mille .",
    "one is therefore left with the perturbative uncertainty , estimated here at about @xmath99 at nlo .",
    "the independence of any form factor uncertainties in @xmath98 comes at the price of using only @xmath100 of the full @xmath78 rate .",
    "we therefore consider a different ratio , which is defined by @xmath101 in this ratio the fully integrated rate of @xmath78 is divided by the integrated rate of @xmath95 with only the narrow - resonance region removed .",
    "this ensures use of the maximal statistics in both channels . due to the missing region in @xmath95 the dependence on the form factor shape",
    "will no longer be eliminated completely , but we still expect a reduced dependence .",
    "numerically we obtain , using the same input as before , @xmath102 this estimate shows that the uncertainty from @xmath48 and @xmath49 is indeed very small , at a level of about @xmath103 . with better empirical information on the shape of the spectrum",
    "this could be further improved .",
    "we conclude that ratios such as those in ( [ r25def ] ) and ( [ r256def ] ) , or similar quantities with modified cuts , are theoretically very well under control .",
    "they are therefore ideally suited for testing the standard model with high precision .",
    "the branching fractions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are sensitive to physics beyond the standard model . in general",
    ", nonstandard dynamics will have a different impact on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the excellent theoretical control over the ratios @xmath98 or @xmath104 will help to reveal even moderate deviations from standard model expectations .",
    "one example is the scenario with modified @xmath105-penguin contributions @xcite , if these contributions interfere destructively with those of the standard model . in that case",
    "the ratios @xmath98 or @xmath104 could be significantly suppressed .",
    "the modified @xmath105-penguin scenario may be realized , for instance , in supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "another class of theories that do change the ratios are those where @xmath1 remains standard model like while @xmath0 receives an enhancement ( or a suppression ) .",
    "substantial enhancements of @xmath106 are still allowed by experiment , in fact much more than for @xmath1 .",
    "a first example are scenarios with light invisible scalars @xmath107 contributing to @xmath108 , which has been suggested in @xcite as an efficient probe of light dark matter particles .",
    "@xmath108 is also discussed in @xcite .",
    "this channel adds to @xmath0 , which is measured as @xmath109 .",
    "if the scalars have nonzero mass , @xmath108 could be distinguished from @xmath0 through the missing - mass spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mass of @xmath107 is small , or the resolution of the spectrum is not good enough , a discrimination of the channels may be difficult .",
    "the corresponding increase in @xmath106 could be cleanly identified through the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath104 .",
    "similar comments apply to the case where the invisible particles are light ( or massless ) neutralinos @xmath110 , which are still allowed in the mssm @xcite .",
    "substantial enhancements of @xmath109 over the standard model expectation through @xmath111 are possible in the mssm with non - minimal flavour violation @xcite .    a further example is given by topcolor assisted technicolor @xcite .",
    "a typical scenario involves new strong dynamics , together with extra @xmath112 bosons , which distinguishes the third generation from the remaining two .",
    "the resulting flavour - changing neutral currents at tree level may then predominantly lead to transitions between third - generation fermions such as @xmath113 .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath106 would result and might in principle saturate the experimental bound ( [ kmnunuexp ] ) .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath73 , which should still be detectable , would probe a @xmath112-boson mass of typically @xmath114 . a similar pattern of enhanced @xmath0 and sm like @xmath1 is also possible in generic @xmath112 models @xcite .",
    "the subject of new physics in @xmath2 transitions has been discussed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . new physics in @xmath5 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the strategy discussed here puts @xmath0 as a new physics probe in the same class as @xmath115 , the ` golden modes ' of kaon physics .",
    "suitable ratios of ( partially integrated ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay rates are essentially free of form factor uncertainties , while retaining sensitivity to interesting new physics scenarios . @xmath0 together with @xmath1 thus hold exciting opportunities for @xmath67 physics in the era of super flavour factories .",
