    "calculational schemes that are perturbative in the coulomb interaction are known to be inadequate for describing strongly interacting electrons in systems such as , for example , transition metal oxides , organic conductors and quantum dots @xcite and this necessitates the use of non perturbative methods , such as the renormalization group , dynamical mean field theory @xcite and various numerical methods . the @xmath4 expansion for",
    "@xmath0 fold replicated degrees of freedom ( with subsequent extrapolation to the physical value of @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) was successfully applied to magnetic impurities @xcite and in other areas of physics @xcite . in almost all applications to electronic systems ,",
    "this expansion uses semiclassical saddle point integration and its success in the case of the repulsive hubbard model @xcite is open to question because it is unclear where a suitable saddle point exists .",
    "an alternative version of the @xmath7 expansion was discovered by t hooft @xcite in the context of @xmath8 quantum chromodynamics and relies instead on dominance of diagrams of simple topology for @xmath9 .",
    "recently it was noticed @xcite that t hooft s topological classification of diagrams can be applied to the hubbard model , with collective excitations playing the role that gauge bosons play in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "this raises the challenge of reconstructing the large @xmath0 extrapolation for electron systems from the very beginning in a way that avoids saddle point integration .",
    "the symplectic extrapolation of the hubbard model @xcite,@xcite is interesting because , unlike the @xmath10 extension , it conserves the notion of two component spins and permits pairing . in the present paper ,",
    "we solve this model exactly in two special cases ( i ) in the bosonic sector on an infinite lattice at @xmath2 and ( ii ) on a dimer of two points for any @xmath0 .",
    "our solution at @xmath2 shows the existence not only of neutral spin fluctuations but also of charged pair fluctuations that are in the same multiplet and exactly degenerate with the spin fluctuations at zero doping .",
    "our solution of the dimer for any @xmath0 indicates a smooth interpolation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 without any apparent singularity . taken together these results",
    "indicate that ( i ) both spin and pair fluctuations must be included from the very beginning in any theory of weakly doped antiferromagnets and ( ii ) that the expansion in powers of @xmath4 about an appropriate @xmath2 limit is a legitimate procedure in this context .",
    "the symplectic extrapolation of hubbard s model @xcite that we consider here is based on @xmath11 , the group of unitary transformations on @xmath12 quaternions and it leads to the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath13 + \\sum_{x , y}t_{xy}% \\psi _ { x}^{+}\\psi _ { y }   \\label{symplectic }",

    "it will be shown below that this naive expectation is correct and that the symplectic extrapolation of the hubbard model contains indeed both neutral and charged collective excitations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we solve the @xmath10 hubbard model first for two points and any @xmath0 using @xmath22 pseudo spins and we also find the @xmath23 hamiltonian in the bosonic sector for an infinite lattice . in section 3",
    "we determine the @xmath9 asymptotics of the symplectic model after mapping it onto a model of the double exchange type and we also solve the symplectic model on a dimer for any @xmath0 using the group @xmath24 as a classifying symmetry . in section 4 we identify the spectrum of the asymptotic @xmath23 and @xmath25 hamiltonians .",
    "section 5 serves to counterbalance our extensive use of ancient boson operator methods by reformulating our problem in standard path integral language .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "for simplicity , we begin with an @xmath10 extrapolation @xcite of the hubbard model @xcite : @xmath26 which we simplify even further by specializing it to a dimer of only two points :    @xmath27    here @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath16 enumerates the electron species and we have chosen hopping amplitudes with a ( naive ) bandwidth of 1 . this hamiltonian describes electrons on a ladder of length @xmath0 with hopping along the rungs @xmath30 or tunnelling between two mesoscopic quantum dots on a semiconducting substrate , each doped with @xmath0 electron donors .",
    "the position @xmath31 on the dimer can be viewed as a pseudo spinor index and @xmath32 can be expressed entirely in terms of pseudo spin operators as follows : @xmath33 where the constant has physical meaning because it depends on electron filling .",
    "because the hamiltonian decomposes into blocks of distinct pseudo spins we may diagonalize it separately in each block and determine the optimal value of the pseudo spin at the end ( it is impossible to diagonalize the @xmath10 dimer for large @xmath0 by brute force because the dimension of its hilbert space explodes like @xmath34 ) . it",
    "it is useful to diagonalize the hopping term by interchanging the conventional representations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 because @xmath38 as @xmath9 a naive first approximation to the ground state is @xmath39 . to understand the action of the hamiltonian on states in the vicinity of @xmath40",
    ", we express it in terms of holstein - primakoff @xcite oscillators :    @xmath41    and then diagonalize it with the help of a bogoljubov transformation : latexmath:[\\ ] ] ( we have rescaled the oscillators to have conventional commutation relations ) .",
    "the lagrangian we need is just a slight generalization of the conventional one : @xmath157 correlators ( in imaginary time ) of harmonic variables such as @xmath158 and @xmath159 are well known to be given by the inverse of the quadratic form in the imaginary time action : latexmath:[\\[<b_{p_{1}q_{1}}(t)b_{p_{2}q_{2}}^{+}(0)>=<p_{1}q_{1};t|\\frac{1}{{\\it m}}%    interaction @xmath154  which , in @xmath161 space and in terms of the rescaled variables @xmath158 , reads : @xmath162 the operator @xmath163 picks out the coincident piece of the wave function and satisfies the projector relation @xmath164 .",
    "we decompose the full action into its  freeand  interacting  part by writing @xmath165 with @xmath166\\ ] ] where @xmath167 describes free propagation of particle hole pairs with @xmath168 .",
    "according to general principles , the free propagator @xmath169 is just the inverse of @xmath167 : @xmath170 the last expression resembles the particle hole propagator that enters into the calculation of bubbles and lindhard s function and this indicates that we are on the right track .",
    "next we switch on @xmath50 and exploit @xmath164 , the locality of the interaction , in a way reminiscent of the treatment of a friedel resonance : @xmath171 @xmath172 represents propagation and rescattering  of particle hole pairs or a sum of bubbles .",
    "the preceding argument shows that the spectrum of the @xmath23 hamiltonian corresponds to zeroes of the operator @xmath173 the locality of the interaction @xmath154 leads to a propagator of coincident pairs and to functions of a single label .",
    "fourier transforming we find @xmath174 but the correlation @xmath175 for free fields is also calculable via wicks theorem : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the hopping matrix . using conventional matsubara techniques",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath178 we conclude that the spectrum of the boson hamiltonian corresponds to the singularities of @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a susceptibility . at half filling , in d=2 dimensions and at @xmath181 the fourier transform of @xmath182 is well known @xcite to diverge logarithmically to @xmath183  because of an incipient antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "we conclude that the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath184 describes bubbles that have a pole near @xmath181 at half filling .",
    "this pole in the spin fluctuation channel is also seen in neutron scattering on cuprates @xcite .    at half filling the spectrum of the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath185 eq([rpade ] ) on an infinite lattice  is very similar to that of the @xmath152 model .",
    "again the hamiltonian describes bubbles and again the spectrum is dominated by fluctuations at @xmath181 except that there is now an extra band index .",
    "the excitations form a triplet of spin and pair fluctuations that are exactly degenerate at half filling .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to establish exact  results on the symplectic model in order to see whether the expansion in powers of @xmath4 about @xmath2 in this model makes any sense .",
    "the boson expansion helped us find the asymptotic hamiltonian for a finite number of points but as we have seen in the last section this method becomes inconvenient for dealing with infinite lattices where the bosons seriously overcount the degrees of freedom . in this section",
    "we return to main stream methods of condensed matter physics and discuss how to extrapolate to from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .    from the preceding sections it follows that a treatment of doped antiferromagnets and the hubbard model at low temperature near half filling requires a self consistent treatment of electron propagation and spin and pair fluctuations .",
    "this may be done either using the topological expansion given in @xcite or by using the more conventional saddle point method . for simplicity",
    "we adopt the saddle point method , although the topological expansion is presumably the more powerful approach .",
    "we may set up a @xmath4 expansion of the double exchange model by conventional hubbard - stratonovich transformation :    @xmath186    where @xmath187 is the hopping amplitude .",
    "like in preceding work on the @xmath8 hubbard model at large @xmath0 ( @xcite ) the phase factor ",
    "@xmath30  is essential to get the correct coefficient  @xmath188 for the coupling in the double exchange model and again the factor",
    " causes no difficulty because @xmath189 is purely imaginary at the saddle point . to see this , we integrate over the fermionic degrees of freedom and find the stationary point of the effective action : : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } z & = & \\int d\\overrightarrow{\\phi } d\\psi \\exp -s=\\int d\\phi \\exp -s_{eff } \\\\",
    "\\frac{s_{eff}(\\overrightarrow{\\phi } ) } { n } & = & \\int \\sum_{x}\\overrightarrow{% \\phi } _ { x}^{2}dt-\\log \\det \\left ( \\partial _ { t}+t^{hop}+\\mu \\sigma _ { 3}-i% \\sqrt{u}\\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\sigma } \\overrightarrow{\\phi } \\right ) + const   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "s\\bigskip _ { eff } & = & 0\\rightarrow i\\overrightarrow{\\phi } ( x , t)=\\frac{1% } { 2}\\sqrt{u}tr\\overrightarrow{\\sigma } < xt|\\frac{1}{\\partial _ { t}+t^{hop}+\\mu \\sigma _ { 3}-i\\sqrt{u}\\cdot \\overrightarrow{\\sigma } \\overrightarrow{\\phi } } %    ( there are @xmath0 species that contribute to @xmath191 , hence the factor @xmath4 ) . so the hypothesis that @xmath192 is real is consistent , but difficulties may be anticipated for @xmath193 .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that the spin fluctuations are quickly killed by doping while the pair fluctuation channel remains intact .",
    "the likely explanation is that the spin fluctuations correspond to longitudinal fluctuations of @xmath189 in the @xmath194 direction while the pair fluctuations correspond goldstone like rotations about the @xmath103 axis .",
    "one may also expand @xmath195 to second order in @xmath189 and confirm the existence of degenerate spin and pair fluctuations at half filling and @xmath2 without ever using boson operators ( but we do not see how to avoid them in the dimer problem ) .",
    "a detailed study of the extrapolation to @xmath3 via coupled integral equations will be given in a separate  paper .",
    "in this paper we have derived two exact results that serve as first steps towards a @xmath4 expansion of the symplectic hubbard model .",
    "firstly , we diagonalized the symplectic dimer for any @xmath0 using an underlying @xmath196 classifying symmetry .",
    "we found a smooth interpolation , without any singularities , between @xmath3 and @xmath2 which suggests that the expansion , in powers of @xmath4 , about the point @xmath2 is indeed legitimate .",
    "secondly , we determined the hamiltonian of the symplectic model for @xmath1 and found a multiplet of collective modes containing charged pair fluctuations and neutral spin fluctuations that are exactly degenerate with each other at half filling .",
    "this tells us that pair fluctuations in doped antiferromagnets are essential degrees of freedom    on the way to establishing these results we found analogous results for the @xmath8 extrapolation of the hubbard model and we also indicated how holstein - primakoff like boson operators may be replaced by more familiar and more powerful green s function techniques .",
    "the map of the original symplectic model onto a magnetic model that is reminiscent of a double exchange model proved crucial to our arguments .",
    "this map is interesting in its own right because it may provide us with a simple physical picture of the superconducting instability .",
    "the extrapolation from @xmath2 to @xmath3 requires a self consistent treatment of fermions interacting with their own triplet of collective modes and taking into account mutual renormalization of bosonic and fermionic fluctuations in a way similar to the flex approach . in the light of our results ,",
    "the flex approach is more closely related to the @xmath10 extrapolation of the hubbard model than the @xmath11 one as it ignores the pairing fluctuations of the latter model .",
    "the integral equations of the extrapolation to @xmath3 follow essentially from the topological classification given previously in @xcite , but the details remain to be worked out .",
    "several scenarios for the physics of pair fluctuations have been suggested , ranging from preformed pairs @xcite to postulating a quantum phase transition at a critical doping @xcite .",
    "also , various authors have added pair fluctuations on top of antiferromagnetic ones and obtained interesting results @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say , however , that the details of the competition between spin and pairing fluctuations still remain to be understood .",
