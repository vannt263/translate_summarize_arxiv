    "`` incommensurate peaks '' are observed to persist up to a temperature @xmath171 , above which magnetic peaks indicative of stripe structure can be regained by application of a @xmath172 magnetic field .",
    "the field - induced stripe spacing ( both above and slightly below @xmath171 ) is smaller than the zero - field stripe spacing observed below @xmath171 . as noted by the authors,@xcite the ferrimagnetic response is naturally explained by bond - centered stripes . in the high temperature field - induced stripe phase , the diagonal stripes have spacing @xmath23 .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "[ dbond ] suggest that this field - induced transition should be accompanied by a dramatic change in the low - energy spin wave dispersion , from linear to quadratic .",
    "we have also shown that ( as in the site - centered case@xcite ) the number of bands in a bond - centered configuration is set by the number of spins in the unit cell , rather than by the spacing @xmath9 .",
    "generally , for both vertical and diagonal stripes , site - centered stripes have @xmath173 spin wave bands , and bond - centered stripes have @xmath9 bands .",
    "the exception is the case of diagonal site - centered stripes with odd spacing @xmath9 , which has @xmath174 bands .",
    "an experimental consequence of this is that for a given value of @xmath9 , bond - centered stripes have @xmath9 spin wave bands , whereas site - centered stripes have at most @xmath34 bands .",
    "although not yet observed experimentally , this means that the upper bands can also be used to distinguish site- from bond - centered stripes .",

    "@xmath155 , only one spin wave band is expected , whereas for db3 , we expect to find three bands . the observance of a second band ( or eqivalently a spin wave crossing ) for diagonal @xmath23 sripes would rule out a site - centered configuration",
    "of course , negative evidence is dicier , and the observance of the smaller number of bands can not distinguish the two , as it can not rule out the possibility that the top band is too faint to be observed .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied regular arrays of antiphase domain walls in two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets and find that their location relative to the lattice_i.e . _ , whether they are site - centered or bond - centered  produces distinct effects which may be measurable in a diffraction probe such as neutron scattering . in particular , arrays of odd - width , bond - centered antiphase domain walls generically produce more elastic peaks than site - centered stripes .",
    "in addition , bond - centered stripes generically produce more bands than site - centered stripes . we further find that low - energy spin wave velocities are not always directly related to the exchange couplings in the model , and in particular for bond - centered configurations , rather isotropic spin wave cones are predicted for a wide range of parameters .",
