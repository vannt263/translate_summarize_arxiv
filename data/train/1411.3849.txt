    "a possible route could be provided by recording rotational interferograms for several vibrational states .",
    "alternatively , one could exploit the full rovibrational dynamics . in both cases , however , it might turn out to be difficult to disentangle effects that are due to the shape of the potential energy curve ( which is also known only approximately ) from those that are caused by the @xmath133-dependence of the polarizability anisotropy .",
    "additionally , the interferometric technique may be utilized to probe local electric fields , such as the radio - frequency fields at different positions within a ( linear ) paul trap .",
    "obviously , the rotational ramsey interferometer will work as well for other molecular ion species , provided the laser light does not drive resonant transitions .",
    "we would like to thank rosario gonzlez - frez and daniel reich for fruitful discussions .",

    "<S> a ramsey - type interferometer is suggested , employing a cold trapped ion and two time - delayed off - resonant femtosecond laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the laser light couples to the molecular polarization anisotropy , inducing rotational wavepacket dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> an interferogram is obtained from the delay dependent populations of the final field - free rotational states . </S>",
    "<S> current experimental capabilities for cooling and preparation of the initial state are found to yield an interferogram visibility of more than 80% . </S>",
    "<S> the interferograms can be used to determine the polarizability anisotropy with an accuracy of about @xmath0 , respectively @xmath1 , provided the uncertainty in the initial populations and measurement errors are confined to within the same limits . </S>"
