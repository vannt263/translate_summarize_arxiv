    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies surrounding the milky way have been the subject of intensive observational programs in recent years .",
    "thanks to the labours of a number of groups  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radial velocity surveys with multi - object spectrographs have now provided datasets of thousands of stars for the bright dsphs , like fornax and draco .",
    "early indications that the velocity dispersion profiles might be flat  @xcite have now been confirmed for all the bright dsphs out to the radius at which the mean surface brightness falls to the background  @xcite .",
    "the huge interest in the dsphs is of course provoked by the enormous mass - to - light ratios inferred from their stellar kinematics .",
    "ever since the pioneering work of @xcite , it has been apparent that the dsphs are the most dark matter dominated systems in the universe . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the substantial dark matter content makes the dsphs relatively simple .",
    "they are typically composed of intermediate - age to old stellar populations apparently embedded in massive dark halos . in the bright dsphs ,",
    "star formation therefore ceased many dynamical times ago , and so the stellar content should be well - mixed in the potential of the dark halo .",
    "this therefore offers one of the best opportunities to learn about the structure of dark halos in the local universe .",
    "since 2005 , there has been a succession of discoveries of very faint local group dwarfs in data from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "this includes at least ten new dwarf spheroidals  @xcite , one dwarf irregular  @xcite , as well as three satellites that have properties intermediate between dwarf galaxies and globular clusters  @xcite .",
    "all these objects have surface brightnesses and luminosities lower than any previously known galaxies , and consequently have come to be known collectively as the ultrafaints .",
    "it is often assumed , although without much evidence , that the ultrafaints are the low luminosity counterparts of the classical dwarfs .",
    "it is fair to say that the modelling of dsphs has not kept pace with the march of the observational data .",
    "a number of authors have inferred properties of the dsphs based on the jeans equations .",
    "typically , this takes the form of assuming a parametric light profile for the stellar component and inferring the velocity dispersion from the jeans equations given an assumed law for the dark matter halo , often of cusped or navarro - frenk - white form  @xcite .",
    "this is a legitimate procedure , although it does have substantial drawbacks .",
    "first , there is no guarantee that a physical distribution function exists for the model .",
    "for example , it is not possible to embed an isotropic cored stellar profile in a navarro - frenk - white halo , even though the jeans equations yield a solution  as the configuration falls foul of the central velocity dispersion theorem  ( @xcite ; see also ciotti & pellegrini ( 1992 ) for an earlier related result ) .",
    "second , the luminous and dark matter profiles are both posited _ a priori _ and it is therefore unlikely that this approach will lead to any insight beyond the starting assumptions .",
    "there is no physical connection between the luminous and dark matter , other than the fact that the velocity dispersions can support the model against gravitational collapse .    here",
    ", we shall take a different approach based on phase space modelling .",
    "this is harder than jeans modelling and has been pursued less often , but is also more powerful .",
    "a significant previous assault on the problem was made by  @xcite , although with a restricted class of models in which the baryonic and dark matter have the same characteristic scalelength .",
    "the flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles of dsphs , as is evident in the impressive data of  @xcite , suggests that an obvious starting point for the dsph stars is an isotropic , isothermal distribution function  @xcite .",
    "better still is to use their spatially limited analogues , the lowered or quasi - isothermals , which have tidal radii imposed by the milky way potential .",
    "these distribution functions are familiar in the modelling of self - gravitating star clusters  @xcite .",
    "let us again emphasise that this approach is tailored to give models that have flattish projected velocity dispersion profiles out to several half - light radii .",
    "the stellar component of the dsphs is of course not self - gravitating ,",
    "so we will develop the theory of lowered or quasi - isothermal distribution functions embedded in dark matter haloes .",
    "notice that this gives a physically motivated starting point which ensures the flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles in the inner parts of the dsphs .",
    "there is also a physical connection between the light profile and the dark matter , as the relaxation of stars towards a quasi - isothermal distribution function takes place in the dark matter potential .",
    "the same distribution in energy space gives rise to different light profiles in different dark matter potentials .    since detailed photometric and kinematic profiles are available only for a few of the dsphs , we do not model each galaxy individually .",
    "rather , we take advantage of the fact that half - light radii and central velocity dispersions are instead available for at least 28 dsphs , orbiting either the milky way or the andromeda galaxies .",
    "observational data show a clear correlation between these two physical quantities , highlighting a connection between the length scale of these systems , their kinematic properties and hence their dark matter content  @xcite .",
    "although the existence of the correlation is clear - cut , its precise form and origin is open to some dispute .",
    "we begin in  2 by re - visiting the data on half - light radii and velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite interpreted the data as a power - law correlation , and analysed the consequences in terms of a universal halo profile for all the dsphs .",
    "we show that , in such a context , a strict power - law correlation necessarily implies that the universal gravitational potential is a power - law of the radius .",
    "in other words , for realistic halo models , the correlation always shows deviations from the power - law form at large half - light radii .",
    "these residuals contain important physical information on the form of the dark halo potential .",
    "the next two sections sketch the theoretical framework to analyse the correlation . in  3 , we derive the behaviour of the correlation in the central parts of cusped and cored universal halos , by assuming an isothermal distribution function for the luminous stellar components .",
    "although these asymptotic results hold good if the luminous material is embedded deep within the dark halo , they eventually became unreliable .",
    "accordingly , ",
    "4 develops the theory of quasi - isothermal distribution functions in dark halo potentials , which enable us to extend the correlation into the regime where the power - law breaks down .",
    "this gives us families of distribution functions that build dsphs , for which the velocity dispersion profile is flat out to several multiples of the half - light radii and for which the correlation between velocity dispersion and half - light radius is essentially the same , modulo scaling transformations .",
    "we return to the hypothesis of universality , and fit a single dark halo model to the data on half - light radius and velocity dispersion in  5 .",
    "it is perhaps better though to perform an object by object analysis .",
    "this gives predictions on the mass of the dark halo for each dsph in  6 .",
    "we show that our modelling gives robust mass estimates out to about 1.7 times the half - light radius .",
    "this strong result is a direct consequence of using distribution function modelling for the luminous component instead of a parametric density profile .",
    "this eliminates , by construction , all non - physical solutions that a jeans analysis can not exclude .",
    "@xcite looked for a correlation between the half - light radius and central velocity dispersion of the form : @xmath12 or , equivalently , @xmath13 where the coefficient @xmath14 and exponent @xmath15 are chosen to give the best fit to the data on the dsphs . here , @xmath0 is the projected half - light radius , that is , the radius of the projected cylinder which contains a half of the total luminosity of the system , whilst @xmath16 is the projected or line of sight velocity dispersion at the centre .",
    "we will re - visit the fitting shortly , but it is worth exploring at outset the consequences of a strict power - law correlation like eqn  ( [ eq : powerlawnp ] ) .",
    "it has been claimed that the dsphs could actually be characterized by some kind of physical universality , for example concerning a common mass scale  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hypothesis of the uniformity of the properties of the dark matter halos embedding the local dsphs constitutes an obvious first step in trying to grasp the physical meaning of any correlations .",
    "let @xmath17 be the spherically symmetric gravitational potential characterizing all the dsphs , and let @xmath18 be the stellar density distribution of any dsph ( they can be different ) .",
    "given the overwhelming preponderance of dark matter in dsphs , the potential well @xmath19 is supposed to be generated by the dark matter halo only .",
    "the luminous components are test or tracer particles only .",
    "each luminous component may be described by its distribution function @xmath20 , which we assume to have the same functional form for all the dsphs .",
    "there is no evidence for anisotropic velocity dispersions , so we make the simplest possible assumption of isotropy .",
    "the distribution function @xmath20 must be a function of the energy only , namely @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a constant . as a consequence ,",
    "the luminous density distribution is a function of radius through the gravitational potential only : @xmath23\\ .\\ ] ] here , we do not need to fix the properties of the distribution function @xmath20 , and thus of the density @xmath24 , in any greater detail .",
    "we just require that the velocity dispersion parameter @xmath22 be closely related to the actual physical ( central ) velocity dispersion @xmath25 , as naturally happens on dimensional grounds .",
    "the equation which defines the half - light radius @xmath0 is @xmath26 a power - law relation @xmath27 is equivalent to the invariance of eqn  ( [ eq : rhdef ] ) with respect to the transformation @xmath28 for all positive real constants @xmath29 .",
    "this is an invariant transformation if and only if @xmath30=\\rho_*\\left[{{\\phi(\\beta^d r)}\\over{\\left(\\beta\\sigma\\right)^2}}\\right]\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : invarcond}\\ ] ] for reasonable , non - constant luminous densities @xmath24 , the condition  ( [ eq : invarcond ] ) is satisfied if and only if the gravitational potential itself has a power - law dependence on the radius , that is if @xmath31 it follows that the gravitational potential itself is a power - law : @xmath32 where @xmath33 . under the present universality hypothesis , the exponent @xmath15",
    "is directly determined by the shape of the dark matter potential only , that is , by the constant @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , the correlation can be re - written as @xmath35 the symbol @xmath36 indicates a simple coefficient , independent of the velocity dispersion parameter , but directly related to the value of the exponent @xmath34 and to the properties of the distribution function @xmath20 .",
    "different distribution functions @xmath20 can only affect the precise value of the coefficient @xmath36 , but can not modify the exponent @xmath15 .",
    "we have thus proved the general theorem that _ for a spherically symmetric , universal dark halo , a power - law correlation between half - light radius and central velocity dispersion can exist only if the potential is a power - law of the radius .",
    "_    of course , the gravitational potential of any dark halo is surely more complicated than a simple power - law .",
    "nonetheless , many popular dark halo models , such as the navarro - frenk - white or cored isothermal profiles , are well - approximated by power - laws in the inner parts . for dsphs",
    "in which the luminous material is embedded deep within a dark halo , a power - law approximation may work well .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that the power - law correlation  ( [ eq : powerlawnp ] ) will break down for objects with larger half - light radii .",

    "such dsphs , then , either they have a central density which is significantly higher than suggested by cosmological n - body simulations ( see upper panel in fig .  [",

    "@xcite claimed that all the dsphs shared a common mass scale of @xmath73 within 300 pc .",

    "the available data is limited to the very central parts of the putative dark halos , and the result is based on a stupendously bold extrapolation .    nonetheless , it is interesting to see if there are any objects for which the assertion of @xcite may be disproved .",
    "[ fig : comparis ] shows that even within the uncertainties , hercules and leo iv are not compatible with a common mass scale of @xmath73 . for hercules , this is because the central velocity dispersion was revised downward to @xmath74 kms@xmath75 by  @xcite , who used strmgren photometry to discriminate between foreground milky way dwarf stars and hercules giants .",
    "this compares with the value of @xmath76 kms@xmath75 originally given by @xcite . even allowing for generous model uncertainties , fig .",
    "[ fig : comparis ] shows the mass of hercules lies below @xmath77 at 300 pc ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this agrees with the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "another counter - example is provided by leo  iv . here ,",
    "300 pc corresponds to @xmath79 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : comparis ] shows that the interior mass is again at most @xmath80 .",
    "we conclude that the common mass - scale of @xcite is illusory .",
    "there are indeed dsphs for which the mass within 300 pc is @xmath73 , such as draco , u mi and fornax .",
    "there are also objects with such small half - light radii , like segue 1 and willman 1 , that the uncertainties of the mass extrapolation to 300 pc are large .",
    "consequently , they may be accommodated within a halo of mass @xmath81 , although much smaller masses are probable . however , there are some objects with intermediate half - light radii , like hercules and leo  iv for which the common mass - scale clearly fails .",
    "it is worth noting that the agreement betwen our masses and earlier investigators is often good .",
    "where results do differ  as for example in hercules or leo iv  it is often because velocity disperion measurements have been revised .",
    "such revisions are always downwards , as contaminants , binary stars and variables always introduce additional scatter if not properly accounted for .",
    "we are able now to refine the plot by @xcite , also extended later by @xcite . in both these works ,",
    "the evident correlation between absolute magnitude and mass - to - light ratio for dsphs was interpreted as the the existence of a common mass scale , and , in particular , as an apparent minimum dark halo mass , within the optical galaxy , of the order of @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "we can now extend the plot by two orders of magnitude in luminosity , and by more than one order of magnitude in mass - to - light ratio ( inside @xmath66 ) . even though the faint end is naturally characterized by larger uncertainties ,",
    "it is striking that a global correlation between luminosity and mass - to - light ratio is still strongly evident in our entire sample ( see the central panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] ) .",
    "we recall also that our sample contains together dsphs that orbit both the milky way and andromeda , but we do not notice any strong systematic difference in the plots of fig .  [",
    "fig : correlations ] between the two populations .",
    "we can not interpret the existence of such a correlation as the evidence of a common mass scale for the dsphs any longer , as we discarded the hypothesis in the previous section ( see [ sec : nocmass ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to look at the correlations between mass and mass - to - light ratio , as well as between luminosity and mass ( see the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] ) . in both these planes ,",
    "our 28 objects sample shows evidence for a correlation , although that considered first by @xcite seems to be the one with the smallest scatter .",
    "it is curious that the correlation between mass and mass - to - light ratio is in fact the one with the largest scatter .",
    "this is slightly unexpected , since the mass and mass - to - light ratio plane is the one in which the use of the same mass diagnostic technique for all the objects is likely to have introduced the largest ( regularizing ) effect . by contrast , in the other two planes , the luminosity comes just as a label for the dsphs , which is completely external to the phace space modelling .",
    "this may suggest that the formations phases of the dsphs are characterized by a physical mechanism that links directly the mass size of their dark matter halo , and then potential well , to the extent and properties of the star formation history they have undergone .",
    "segue 1 has received considerable attention recently as one of the most promising targets for indirect detection of dark matter using the gamma ray signal generated by self - annihilation of neutralinos  @xcite .",
    "this is because segue 1 is relatively nearby ( @xmath83 kpc ) and has a high galactic latitude .",
    "@xcite measured an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath84 kms@xmath75 , which led them to claim an enormous mass - to - light ratio within 50 pc of @xmath85 .",
    "our analysis is consistent with this result .",
    "although the masses are comparable to the results of @xcite , there are reasons to be cautious .    the case that segue 1 is a dark - matter dominated",
    "dwarf galaxy has been seriously undermined by the recent work of  @xcite , who showed that there is strong evidence from the sloan digital sky survey photometry for tidal effects in the outer parts of the object .",
    "this is hard to explain if indeed segue 1 is embedded within a dark halo with mass @xmath86 , as its tidal radius would then be much larger than its half - light radius .",
    "still more worryingly , @xcite raised the possibility of contamination in the @xcite sample , which may cause an artificial inflation of the central velocity dispersion .",
    "segue 1 is in a confused area of the sky , close to both leading and trailing wraps of the sgr stream and the orphan stream .",
    "@xcite showed that there are are kinematic signatures  which they identified with the trailing arm of sgr  close to the heliocentric velocity of segue 1 .",
    "as these stars are also located at roughly the same distance and have roughly the same metallicity as segue 1 , it is difficult to distinguish them from true segue 1 stars , rendering contamination all but inevitable . the available evidence is consistent with the interpretation that segue 1 is a star cluster , originally from the sgr , and now dissolving in the milky way , rather than a dark matter dominated dsph .",
    "the sgr dsph has recently been reassembled by @xcite , who reckoned that the luminosity in the core is @xmath87 .",
    "they also estimated that the total luminosity of the progenitor ( that is , the core plus the stellar debris in the leading and trailing tidal tails ) is @xmath88 , making it comparable to , though slightly fainter in brightness than , the small magellanic cloud .",
    "they estimate that the total mass of the sgr s dark matter halo prior to tidal disruption was @xmath89 .",
    "now , the mass given in table  [ table : resandcomp ] pertains only to the inner parts of the sgr core , namely within @xmath90 kpc . if we extend our nfw model out to @xmath91 kpc to include all the sgr core ( see e.g. , figure 10 of niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "2010 ) then the associated dark halo mass is @xmath92 .",
    "although the mass - to - light of the inner core is 25  ( see table  [ table : resandcomp ] and majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) , the mass - to - light ratio in the sgr tidal streams is in excess of 100 in solar units .    , as defined in eqn  ( [ eq : numapprox ] ) , displayed as a function of the ratio @xmath93 for different families of phase space models .",

    "however , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : massprofile ] and [ fig : comparis ] , these differences generate rather small differences in the enclosed mass @xmath54 .",
    "secondly , the shape of the probability distributions in fig .

    "let us consider the halo mass function , which can be written as , @xmath100 and is valid for any choice of the halo density profile .",
    "we take the limit @xmath101 , appropriate for the case in which the stars are deeply embedded in the halo .",

    "( [ eq : flatcond ] ) , corresponds to selecting families of models whose coefficient @xmath111 is almost constant in @xmath93 , no matter what the precise dark matter density distribution is .",
    "this is easy to see in figure  [ fig : newmassplot ] , which displays the coefficient @xmath112 as a function of @xmath93 for different families of models . the black lines and the associated transparent area represent the families of models used in this paper .",

    "by contrast , gray lines , and the associated gray shaded area represent families of models in which the requirement of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : flatcond ] ) is much less restrictive and @xmath114 . in this case , the global uncertainty on @xmath98 is larger than 50% .",
    "there are many examples of the modelling of the dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) using the jeans equations in the recent literature .",
    "typically , a photometric profile ( king or exponential or plummer ) is combined with a dark halo density law and an assumption as to the behaviour of the anisotropy parameter . from this , simply requiring that the model can hold itself up against the dark halo gravity field via the jeans equations gives a correlation between the scalelengths of the luminous and the dark matter , and a mass estimate of the halo .",
    "although straightforward and popular , it is not clear that jeans modelling can teach us much more .",
    "a first , and well - known , problem is that the overwhelming majority of the solutions thrown up by jeans modelling are unphysical .",
    "there is no phase space distribution function that can reproduce the model .",
    "that is , there is no combination of stellar orbits that builds the stellar density and velocity field .",
    "the second , and rather more subtle problem , has been pointed out recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "seemingly innocent assumptions made concerning the light profile and the anisotropy law in the jeans equations can lead to results that are not generic , but merely a consequence of imposing the initial conditions .",
    "this is particularly the case regarding inferences concerning the behaviour of the dark matter density at the very centre ( for example , whether it is cusped or cored ) .",
    "the future should see more effort devoted to phase space modelling , in which a distribution of stellar orbits provides the observables , namely the density and the velocity dispersion .",
    "this rich field has so far been scarcely touched .",
    "a pioneering effort is that of wilkinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who modelled the draco dsph with distribution functions . in these models ,",
    "the scalelengths of the luminous and dark matter are the same , which restricts their widespread applicability .",
    "wu s ( 2007 ) impressive work constructs axisymmetric two and three integral models for three classical dwarf spheroidals , draco , ursa minor and fornax .",
    "this paper has provided isotropic phase space models for all the milky way dsph galaxies .",
    "the observed flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles strongly suggests that the inner parts of the stellar populations are nearly isothermal , and so the families of lowered isothermal distribution functions made famous by michie ( 1963 ) and king ( 1966 ) are natural starting points . for the dsphs ,",
    "simple collisional relaxation has a physical timescale which is too slow to account for any central thermalization of velocities .",
    "however , a physical basis may be provided by the theory of tidal stirring  @xcite , in which dwarf irregular progenitors are transformed into dsphs by vigorous tidal shocking followed by bar and bending instabilities .",
    "the distribution functions are all isotropic in velocity space .",
    "first , from the point of view of good scientific practice , the simplest assumption should be preferred until evidence to the contrary is found . in this",
    "respect , notice that the case of the dsphs is very different to that of elliptical galaxies , in which there is strong evidence for velocity anisotropy from the plot of observed flattening versus the ratio of ordered to random motions  @xcite .",
    "second , it is striking that most of the studies allowing anisotropy laws  @xcite find fits suggesting that the dsph velocity distributions are nearly isotropic , especially in the central regions .",
    "third , numerical simulations of tidal stirring produce dsphs that are typically isotropic ( see figure 23 of mayer et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "clearly , though , the use of lowered isothermals is not the only possible way to construct models with a flattish velocity dispersion profile .",
    "for example , a tangentially bias in the structure of the orbits that increases with increasing radius could provide similar kinematic profiles .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that a formation scenario based on a collapse and subsequent tidal stirring can favour a tangentially biased velocity dispersion tensor in the outer parts .",
    "when lowered isothermal distribution functions are embedded in dark haloes , then the stellar distribution relaxes in the gravity field of the dark matter .",
    "this leads to a prediction as to the half - light radius @xmath0 as a function of the central velocity dispersion @xmath1 .",
    "modulo the overall scalings of the characteristic halo scalelength and the central dark matter potential , we have shown that this leads in practice to a one - parameter family of models .",
    "if the luminous length scale is much less than the halo scalelength , then the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 has a power - law form .",
    "in particular @xmath115 for a cored halo , and @xmath116 for an nfw halo . for systems",
    "whose luminous scalelength becomes comparable to the scalelength of the dark halo itself , significant deviations from a power - law correlation occur .    to match the observational data for any dsph",
    ", the existence of a theoretical curve between the dimensionless half - light radius and central velocity dispersion considerably restricts the set of suitable models .",
    "note that solutions to the jeans equations do not offer such a correlation  the set of physical solutions to the jeans equations is overwhelmed by the infinitely more numerous unphysical solutions .",
    "in fact , in our approach , only one further ingredient is needed to fix the model , and this we choose as the halo scalelength ( or equivalently the concentration of the dark halo ) .",
    "once this is fixed , then there is only one , for example , nfw model that can place the observed datum for a dsphs onto the theoretical curve .",
    "even better , the mass within @xmath117 times the half - light radius @xmath0 is insensitive to the choice of halo scalelength .",
    "a larger halo scalelength enforces a compensating lower central dark matter density to ensure that the @xmath118 ) datapoint lies on the theoretical curve , so that the mass interior to @xmath119 remains largely unchanged .",
    "this result  perhaps more surprisingly  is also true when the halo model itself is altered , for example from cusped to cored .",
    "accordingly , this enables us to provide reasonably reliable mass estimates for almost all the milky way dsphs out to @xmath119 .",
    "this result is valid for dsphs with flattish a projected velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "the mass results do not support the conjecture of @xcite that all dsphs have a common mass scale within 300 pc .",
    "hercules and leo  iv have a mass interior to 300 pc of at most @xmath80 . it is probable that some of the more puny objects , like segue 1 and willman 1 , also do not satisfy the putative common mass scale , but here the uncertainties of extrapolating the data on such physically small objects out to such a large distance as 300 pc does not allow us to be so definite .    the two most massive of the milky way dsphs are the most luminous , sgr and fornax .",
    "within 1.7 half - light radii , we estimate that sgr has a mass of @xmath120 and fornax @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , we do not reproduce the result of @xcite that physically smaller systems such as draco and sculptor are up to 5 times more massive than fornax despite being roughly 70 times fainter .",
    "the least massive of the milky way satellites are willman 1 ( @xmath122 ) and segue 1 ( @xmath123 ) . for 5 objects  namely boo ii , leo iv , leo v , segue 2 and and xv ",
    "we are only able to provide an upper limit to the mass .",
    "it may well be that these objects are still more runty and unimpressive !",
    "we also notice that the inferred values for the mass - to - light ratios for some of the most luminous dsphs  fornax and leo i particularly  could in fact militate against the validity of the standard approximation that the luminous component as a simple tracer . actually , and especially in the case of a cored dark halo , it is quite likely that the stellar component itself has a non negligible effect on the kinematic structure .",
    "the point that for some of the bright dsphs , stars may contribute equally with the dark matter in the central regions has been noted before @xcite .",
    "the discovery of so many new dsphs over the last few years has thrown open a rich field for theorists .",
    "it is clear that our earlier ideas of common mass scales and universal haloes are giving way under the wealth of new data .",
    "the methods introduced in this paper constitute the first steps in providing the dsphs with phase - space models . here , we have used the data on the half - light radius and central velocity dispersion to provide models for the whole sample .",
    "we plan to complement this with detailed models for some of the individual brighter dsphs in the near future , using the full photometric and kinematic profiles .",
    "we wish to thank giuseppe bertin for making interesting comments and suggestions , as well as the referee for a thorough reading of the paper .",
