    "this new astronomy will enable multi - channel observations of astrophysical phenomena such as @xmath0-ray bursts , supernovae , or flaring magnetars , unveiling an unprecedented view of the nature of the source and its environment .",
    "an important component in many astrophysical phenomena is strong magnetic fields , as demonstrated by the active role they play in the accretion processes of low - mass x - ray binaries and grbs @xcite .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic fields opens up the possibility for interesting effects . among them , which is the central topic of this work , is the coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational emissions that could yield synergistic multi - messenger observations .",
    "in particular , it is important to assess the conditions in which electromagnetic and gravitational emissions influence each other .",
    "there are already hints for such scenario .",
    "it is believed that the flare activity of magnetars seems to be associated with starquakes @xcite .",
    "these quakes are responsible not only for dramatic perturbations and rearrangements of the magnetic field , but also for the breaking of the neutron star crust and internal motions , possibly resulting in the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "detailed studies of magnetar flare activity have revealed a number of features in the afterglow , which can be associated with the crust oscillations as well as with alfvn waves propagating from the core towards the surface  @xcite .",
    "the link or coupling between electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves have been investigated for some cases .",
    "one of them looked at the propagation of gravitational waves linearly coupled to an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this configuration triggers magneto - hydrodynamics waves in the plasma @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the linear nature of the coupling limits the electromagnetic waves to low frequencies , in the best case a few tenths of khz , which will be easily absorbed by the interstellar medium or plasma . in order to produce high frequency and detectable electromagnetic waves ,",
    "non - linear couplings are needed , requiring much stronger gravitational waves . in most of these studies ,",
    "the gravitational waves were assumed to propagate on a flat space - time background .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption when the interaction between the gravitational and electromagnetic waves takes place far from the source .",
    "there have been only very few attempts to treat the electromagnetic - gravity coupling in the strong field regime  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the interaction of electromagnetic and gravitational waves in the vicinity of magnetized neutron stars or black holes immersed in strong magnetic fields using perturbation theory , paying particular attention to how gravitational modes drive the excitation of electromagnetic perturbations .",
    "our work also includes estimates of the energy transferred between the gravitational and electromagnetic sectors . as expected , we find that the excited electromagnetic waves have roughly the same frequency as the driving gravitational waves , i.e. , of the order of a few khz",
    ". electromagnetic waves at these low frequencies can be easily absorbed by the interstellar medium . as a consequence",
    ", one needs to associate them with secondary emission mechanisms ( e.g. , synchrotron radiation ) in order to be able to trace the effects of gravitational waves on the strong magnetic fields .",
    "the later process can be studied following the mechanisms described in  @xcite , and there is work in progress for the special case of strong gravitational fields .",
