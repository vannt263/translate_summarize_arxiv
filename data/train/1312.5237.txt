    "the degrees of freedom suitable for information transmission in free space are the helicity ( circular polarization ) states .",
    "the reason we prefer helicity to horizontal / vertical polarization is its conceptual clarity : the helicity is a poincar invariant  @xcite .",
    "the two casimir operators of the poincar group are the squares of the four - momentum operator @xmath97 and the pauli - lubanski vector @xmath98 . however , their eigenvalues are zero for massless fields and do not serve as ` good ' quantum numbers .",
    "this is because , based on physical grounds , we take only the @xmath99 subgroup of the little group generated by @xmath98 .",
    "instead , we label the states carrying this particular representation as @xmath100 by the eigenvalues of @xmath97 and @xmath98 themselves ( note that @xmath101 and @xmath102  @xcite , where @xmath5 . the momentum / helicity eigenstates @xmath100 satisfy the standard normalization condition @xmath103 .",
    "the ket notation for the eigenstates suggests that they are elements of a hilbert space but that is not really the case .",
    "the explicit realization of a separable hilbert space we are interested in is the space of square - integrable functions . but a momentum / helicity eigenstate is not square integrable and real - world physical processes do not generate such states .",
    "realistic photonic states are wave packets whose spatial localization is provided by a fourier transformation of a square - integrable momentum envelope function @xmath104 .",
    "the general form of such a state is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the relativistic volume element @xmath107 a lorentz transformation @xmath108 of wave packet  ( [ eq : wavepack ] ) induces a unitary transformation @xmath13 : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is wigner s angle  @xcite , whose explicit form can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for the special case of a boost in the wave packet propagation direction studied in this paper the phase is zero .",
    "this can be explicitly shown as follows .",
    "the little group for massless particles is the euclidean group in two dimensions @xmath111 , which is a semi direct product of the rotation group in two dimensions @xmath99 , and the group of translations in the plane @xmath112 .",
    "a general element @xmath113 can be written as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xcite . a nontrivial representation of the translation group in the hilbert space of massless particles yields particle states labeled by continuous internal degrees of freedom @xcite .",

    "the labels @xmath119 and @xmath120 denote , respectively , the four - momentum and the helicity of the photon .    we now show that the wigner angle @xmath121 vanishes when @xmath122 is a pure boost along the @xmath123-axis with velocity @xmath124 , with @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is an arbitrary ( null ) four - momentum vector .",

    "this has the form of a pure translation by the vector @xmath153 in the @xmath154-plane @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath155 as was to be shown .",
    "it is no surprise that boosts along the @xmath123 axis induce a different behavior of the wigner phase in contrast to boosts in any other direction , since the standard vector @xmath27 is defined so that its spatial part points in the @xmath123 direction .",
    "we have here chosen the @xmath123 axis to be the main direction of propagation of the wave packet for calculational convenience only .",
    "any other choice of this direction would of course yield the same results for appropriate definitions of standard vector @xmath27 and standard boosts @xmath128 .",
    "it is natural for the momentum distribution of a realistic wave packet to possess axial symmetry .",
    "one such choice is a gaussian profile whose form reads @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the mean value determining the average direction of wave packet propagation .",
    "this function is normalized in the following sense : @xmath158 but this is not a covariant normalization . for the case of wave packets used in relativistic situations ( meaning that at least one of the observers is moving at a relativistic speed ) ,",
    "we are interested in the following condition being satisfied : @xmath159 where we have redefined the envelope function @xmath160 ) ensures that the overall probability is conserved for a lorentz transformed wave packet .",

    ", we will assume that the variance of the distribution in the @xmath123 direction is much smaller than the variance in the radial direction , i.e. , @xmath162 .",
    "in the end we have to work with the approximated wave packet in spherical coordinates .",

    "we further define the kernel @xmath66 to be @xmath178    there are two covariant options for the upper bound angle @xmath179 .",
    "either it can be @xmath180 , which comes directly from the change of variables given by the transformation in eq .",

    "a closer analysis of eq .  ( [ eq : covnormspherint ] ) reveals that the approximation leads to two gaussian wave packets ( peaked at @xmath185 in the @xmath123 momentum component ) and therefore moving in the opposite direction .",
    "we are , however , interested in only the one with a positive @xmath123 component of the momentum .",
    "hence , the second option for @xmath179 corresponds to the physically interesting situation of just a single - direction traveling wave packet .",
    "of course , the other option would be to define the envelope function to be identically zero in the region corresponding to @xmath186 ( before applying a lorentz transformation ) and then we could set @xmath180 .    the second angle ( eq .  ( [ eq : aberrationangle ] ) ) can be derived from the usual formulas for the relativistic aberration of light given by how a polar angle @xmath187 of one observer is perceived by another inertial observer as a function of @xmath69 : @xmath188 by setting @xmath189 we obtain the angle @xmath179 in eq .",

    "<S> the main reason lies in the nontrivial dependence of the helicity on the momentum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the consequences is the impossibility to trace over the momentum degree of freedom , leading to some interesting effects for two inertial observers trying to communicate by sending such wave packets  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> when it comes to quantum communication over a noisy quantum channel , the important quantity is the classical or quantum channel capacity studied in quantum shannon theory  @xcite ( or @xcite for more mathematically oriented readers ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantum channel capacities quantify the highest achievable rate at which nearly perfect transmission of quantum  @xcite or classical  @xcite messages through a noisy quantum channel is possible . </S>",
    "<S> quantum codes prepared for this purpose by the sender can be used for transmission of classical  @xcite or quantum information  @xcite . in order to establish the channel capacity , </S>",

    "<S> the most suitable carriers of information seem to be photons with helicity ( circular polarization ) degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> our intention is to analyze a realistic scenario where the photonic states are spatially localized polychromatic wave packets whose momentum distribution is a reasonably chosen square - integrable function . </S>",
    "<S> we do not rely on less realistic schemes with momentum / helicity eigenstates  @xcite or linearly polarized wave packets  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we use the highly realistic and simple detection mechanism proposed in  @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the two main reasons that jointly contribute to the appearance of a noisy channel are ( i ) the lorentz transformation itself and ( ii ) the detection process . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , even the sender in his own reference frame can not simply undo the mapping @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the intentionally low level of sophistication of the detection process  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we identify the induced quantum channel to be a pauli channel whose parameters are functions of the boost and the wave packet variance . we calculate the classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite capacities of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the quantum capacity of a general pauli channel is not known to possess a calculable formula , but a lower bound on reliable quantum communication is known ( the hashing bound  @xcite ) , and an upper bound on the zero quantum capacity based on a no - cloning argument is known as well  @xcite . as one of the consequences we conclude that for two observers whose quantum capacity is initially zero ( due to a poorly prepared wave packet ) , it can be increased arbitrarily close to its maximum value by a boost in the right direction . </S>",
    "<S> the two observers can be initially at rest or moving with respect to each other . the amplification effect due to a lorentz boost exists for the classical capacity as well . </S>",

    "<S> the main consequence is that we do not need to evaluate the density matrix integrals in  ( [ eq : rhoout ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is not even desirable  we are interested in the channel and its capacities as functions of @xmath69 and @xmath18 ( certainly not of @xmath70 or @xmath71 ! ) and the above identification enables us to find analytic and perturbative expressions ( in @xmath18 ) for @xmath72 ( as illustrated for @xmath73 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( b.3 ) , ( b.12 ) and  ( b.4 ) ) .    based on this insight </S>",
    "<S> , we are now ready to write down an expression for the classical capacity and lower and upper bounds of the quantum capacity . following the prescription given in  @xcite for general unital qubit channels , we write @xmath74 for the classical capacity of a pauli channel  @xmath52 , where @xmath75 is the shannon entropy , @xmath76 and @xmath77 in our case . </S>",
    "<S> for a lower bound on the quantum capacity we use the hashing ( random coding ) bound  @xcite given by @xmath78 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum capacity of a pauli channel is zero if the following condition is satisfied  @xcite : @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an upper bound we draw our main conclusion from and together with @xmath80 and @xmath81 it is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : caps ] .    </S>",
    "<S> assume an inertial observer who prepares a poor wave packet @xmath1 whose spread @xmath18 leads to @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the quantum capacity is exactly zero ( recall that even the sender himself , equipped with our realistic detection scheme , can not reverse the mapping @xmath2 ) , and therefore no quantum communication is , in principle , possible ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : caps ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , one of the participants lorentz boosts himself in such a way that the envelope function eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : approxenvelop ] ) becomes sufficiently localized , then the hashing bound becomes strictly positive and reliable quantum communication is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely what we see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : capsboosted ] for negative rapidity @xmath69 , which means that the sender and the receiver are approaching each other . a similar increase as a consequence of the lorentz boost </S>",
    "<S> is witnessed for the classical capacity ( not depicted ) . moreover , from the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) of the @xmath72 functions it follows that both communication rates approach their maximal value one . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , in this limit , the envelope function becomes a delta function with all the helicity vectors aligned , turning the pauli channel into a noiseless channel .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore for the first time demonstrate an intricate connection between quantum shannon theory and special relativity . </S>",
    "<S> this follows the footsteps of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the relation between classical shannon theory and special relativity has been exposed . </S>",
    "<S> several comments are in place . </S>",
    "<S> first , here we consider a lorentz boost in the direction of propagation of the wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> a more general lorentz transformation would lead to a more complicated behavior due to the presence of a nontrivial wigner phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is a gap between cerf s bound and the nonzero hashing bound ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : caps ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli channel in this area is not a one - pauli channel ( defined as having any pair of @xmath85 zero ) for which the hashing bound equals the quantum capacity itself  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence it may happen that the method based on highly degenerate quantum codes showing superadditivity of the optimized coherent information for pauli channels  @xcite can lead to nonzero rates despite the hashing bound being zero . </S>",
    "<S> third , if a wave packet is used without the polarization unrotation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : unrotation ] ) ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : unrotation ] ) ) , the resulting channel turns out to be @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a qubit depolarizing channel  @xcite and @xmath88 is a one - pauli channel with @xmath89 and @xmath90 . because of the aforementioned property of the one - pauli channels , we have @xmath91 . by further using the bottleneck inequality for the quantum capacity </S>",
    "<S> we finally obtain @xmath92 thus , reliable quantum transmission is impossible .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind the possibility of increasing the channel capacity is the deformation of the wave packet due to the relativistic aberration of light . loosely speaking </S>",
    "<S> , the boost reduces the relative width of the wake packet in the transverse plane , which in turn allows for enhanced communication rates . </S>",
    "<S> note that the transverse component of the polarization vector can be controlled via polarizing plates ; it is the longitudinal component of the polarization vector which is not controllable by the observers . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we have shown , its detrimental effect on information transmission can be reduced by an appropriate lorentz transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from rigorously quantifying the rate at which two inertial observers can quantum communicate , our work also sheds light on the intriguing observation made in  @xcite on the presence of non - completely positive ( non - cp ) dynamics in relativistic transformations of photonic wave packets . </S>",
    "<S> here we conclude that it is more of a mathematical curiosity than having a real physical impact . to see this , we summarize the situation studied in this paper in the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> we first map a logical qubit @xmath58 to a realistic photonic wave packet @xmath1 . we either may decide to detect the wave packet using the detection given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) ( downward arrow labeled @xmath93 ) and obtain a helicity density matrix @xmath94 or we can lorentz boost @xmath1 to obtain @xmath95 ( wavy line ) and then detect . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a density matrix @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it may indeed happen that the dotted line connecting @xmath94 and @xmath29 represents a non - cp map ( depends on the boost direction ) , but the important point is that once @xmath94 is received , @xmath29 ca nt be obtained by a lorentz boost , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic protocol ends by obtaining a helicity density matrix  only wave packets are lorentz transformed ( that is , transmitted ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli channels @xmath96 and @xmath52 are mutually exclusive .      </S>",
