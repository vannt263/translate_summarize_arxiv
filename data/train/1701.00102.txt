    "there are no masers reported at the locations of g306.3@xmath00.9 and sourcea indicating an interaction with the mcs . by assuming a spherical geometry of the cloud",

    "these derived proton densities are much lower in comparison to the densities derived for other snrs , such as 3c 391 and g349.7@xmath250.2 @xcite , that are interacting with mcs .    however , although co is the most widely used proxy to track down molecular gas in the galaxy , not all portions of an mc containing h@xmath27 also contain co. new data from esa s herschel space observatory ( _ herschel _ ) @xcite confirmed this estimation by showing that almost one third of all molecular gas in the milky way had remained undetected .",
    "_ herschel _ s survey has established the three - dimensional distribution of the molecular gas across the milky way using a different tracer ( ionized carbon ( c+ ) ) for h@xmath27 .",
    "the densest mc cores of the ism , where most of the molecular gas resides , contain both h@xmath27 and co , but their immediate surroundings might be influenced by ultraviolet radiation from nearby stars , where h@xmath27 and c+ are found to coexist . `",
    "co - dark ' molecular gas is named for regions of h@xmath27 mixed with co that can not be traced by co emission .",
    "herschel _ data showed that co - dark h@xmath27 accounts for about 30 per cent of the milky way s entire reservoir of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "assuming there is a dense gas cloud at the location of sourcea , we can interpret the results such that the crs escaping from g306.3@xmath00.9 reaching the dense mc at the location of sourcea , causing the emission of gamma rays ( the illuminated cloud scenario ) .",
    "sourcea has a radius of extension of 0.@xmath2372 and the angular distance between the radio location of g306.3@xmath00.9 and best - fitting location of sourcea is 0.@xmath23576 , which corresponds to a physical distance of 81 pc considering an 8 kpc distance to the snr and assuming that sourcea is also at the same distance as the snr .",
    "@xcite has shown in their figure 5 left - most panel , the gamma - ray energy flux emitted from an mc of mass 10@xmath31 solar masses and at a distance of 1 kpc for the case , where the distance between the snr and mc is about 50 pc . using the dotted line , which refers to the emission at a time 2000 years after the sn explosion , we calculated the expected gamma - ray energy flux emitted for 1 kpc of distance , which is about 3 @xmath15 10@xmath32 mev @xmath8 s@xmath17 and 3 @xmath15 10@xmath33 mev @xmath8 s@xmath17 for 10 and 100 gev , respectively . after correcting for the distance of 8 kpc ,",
    "these values become @xmath14 @xmath15 10@xmath34 mev @xmath8 s@xmath17 and @xmath14 @xmath15 10@xmath16 mev @xmath8 s@xmath17 for 10 and 100 gev , respectively .",
    "if the distance to sourcea is about 1 kpc , the sed data point at 10 gev of sourcea shown in figure [ gfigure_3 ] is comparable to the expected gamma - ray energy flux from the illuminated clouds .",
    "if the distance of sourcea is the assumed 8 kpc , comparing the estimated gamma - ray energy flux values of the illuminated clouds with the measured sed data points of sourcea shown in figure [ gfigure_3 ] , we can conclude that the estimated gamma - ray energy flux values are lower than the measured ones .",
    "so , there might be a source of gamma rays other than the illuminated clouds that is contributing to the total gamma - ray emission coming from sourcea .",
    "in this work , we examined the elemental abundances , ionization state of plasma and the explosive origin of g306.3@xmath00.9 using _ suzaku _ observation and investigated the gamma - ray emission from g306.3@xmath00.9 and its neighborhood using the _ fermi_-lat data .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we found that the thermal x - ray emission from g306.3@xmath00.9 consists of two @xmath35 plasmas .",
    "the overabundances of si , s , ar , ca and fe in the hot temperature component confirm the ejecta - dominated nature of g306.3@xmath00.9 .",
    "the low - temperature component is associated with an ism material .",
    "the regional spectral analysis shows that @xmath35 , abundances , and @xmath9 of the nei component are generally highest for the whole spectrum , compared to the mean values found for the center and the rim .",
    "for example , abundances of si and fe are significantly higher for the whole snr than those for the center and the rim , which could be a result of systematic uncertainties .",
    "these systematic errors do not affect the conclusions drawn in this paper .",
    "we clearly detected the fe - k line emission in the ejecta component of this remnant .",
    "its centroid energy is supportive of the type ia sn origin .",
    "we compared the results of our spectral fit to the predicted abundances from cc @xcite and type ia sn @xcite models .",
    "the results show that neither type ia nor cc sn of 11@xmath36 and 12@xmath36 progenitors is conclusively favored for g306.3@xmath00.9 , while the cc sn of a 15@xmath36 progenitor is ruled out .",
    "g306.3@xmath00.9 is not detected in gamma - rays .",
    "x - ray observations of g306.3@xmath00.9 revealed that the snr is formed in a supernova explosion of type ia and there is no compact object . additionally , synchrotron emission from a pwn or x - ray filaments in the shell of the snr was not observed .",
    "so , we do not expect to see gamma - ray emission from g306.3@xmath00.9 that could be produced by electrons accelerated at the forward shock through the relativistic bremsstrahlung or inverse compton scattering processes .",
    "the alternative way of producing gamma rays would be through the hadronic process , where accelerated hadrons interact with the background gas and subsequently produce gamma rays from the neutral pion decay .",
    "if g306.3@xmath00.9 were in a dense molecular cloud region , we might have been able to detect hadronic gamma rays .",

    "due to the low molecular gas density at the location of sourcea , a significant contribution of the hadronic gamma - ray emission is not expected .",
