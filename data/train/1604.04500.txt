    "<S> the presence of these pathways will depend strongly on how the material is fabricated , and so the smallest measured @xmath51 value is probably the most reliable , and the most directly comparable to our calculations . we calculate @xmath51 to be more than two orders of magnitude smaller in mapi than the direct - gap semiconductors cdte and gaas , but larger than the fully indirect si . </S>",
    "<S> mapi resembles an indirect gap semiconductor for radiative carrier recombination , and a direct gap semiconductor for absorption .    . </S>",
    "<S> left : for cdte , gaas and mapi at room temperature , varying photoexcitation density _ </S>",
    "<S> n_. all have comparable direct band gaps and effective masses . at @xmath52@xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> the mapi spin - split indirect - gap saturates and the rate of radiative recombination becomes similar in all three materials . also shown </S>",
    "<S> are mapi calculated at 200k and 400k . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the indirect gap becomes more pronounced as @xmath33 decreases . * ( b ) * temperature dependence of radiative recombination for @xmath53@xmath38 . ]    the magnitude of b increases as the _ k_-space overlap between electron and hole distributions increases . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the rate of bimolecular recombination to depend on external parameters in an unusual manner . </S>",
    "<S> for example , increasing temperature smears @xmath54 and @xmath31 over a wider band of @xmath5 for fixed @xmath34 , causing to increase with @xmath33 . the temperature dependence of in gaas and cdte ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bcoeff ] ) is weaker and of opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> further , bimolecular recombination will increase abruptly with photoexcited carrier density once the electon pockets begin to fill up and overlap ( @xmath5510@xmath56@xmath57s@xmath58 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bcoeff ] ) , in sharp contrast to cdte and gaas . only at high carrier concentrations when a significant fraction of electrons and holes overlap does in mapi become comparable to in cdte , where it also adopts the conventional behaviour and begins to decrease with increasing @xmath34 . the strong carrier density , and therefore laser - fluence , dependence of suggests that global fits to time resolved data are not a reliable method to infer or lifetime from ( equation [ eq : lifetime ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of with carrier density will make high fluence transients multi - exponential , and break the expected relationship between light - emission and carrier - density sensitive experimental probes .    for photoexcitation densities @xmath59@xmath57s@xmath58 ( @xmath25 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath60 4@xmath6110@xmath62 at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these are the charge carrier densities relevant for device operation in sunlight . </S>",
    "<S> as is fairly constant below this charge carrier density , we can use equation [ eq : lifetime ] to derive a lifetime of order 10 - 100@xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this lifetime is consistent with values reported in literature for single crystal samples under 1 and 0.1 sun intensity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is limited temperature dependent trpl data available . </S>",
    "<S> most data is for polycrystalline films , whereas our results would best be compared to single crystal measurements . </S>",
    "<S> yet it has been observed that the carrier lifetime is highly temperature sensitive at low fluence while being temperature insensitive at high fluence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in minority carrier lifetime with decreasing sample temperature can be directly explained by a contraction of the fermi - dirac distribution near the spin - split band minima .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have considered mapi in an idealized static structure . in reality , the high temperature phase of mapi is cubic on average only ; the dipolar molecules between cages continually rotate , the cages flex and tilt . </S>",
    "<S> second - order jahn - teller deformations of the octahedra due to the pb 6@xmath64 lone pair directly distort the lead iodide bonds , generating local electric fields near the atomic core region where spin - orbit coupling is high . </S>",
    "<S> recent molecular - dynamics simulations by etienne et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest that the conduction band splitting persists in the presence of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> if the material has true inversion symmetry , as mapi is believed to in the orthorhombic phase below 162 k , no directional electric fields can exist , and so the spin - split indirect - gap should vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of radiative recombination should increase , increasing the competition with non - radiative recombination and thus increasing photoluminescent efficiency .    to assess the effect of dynamic disorder we performed _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ molecular dynamics at 300 k with a @xmath65 supercell . </S>",
    "<S> such supercells are able to accurately describe the phonon modes both at the @xmath9 point and the brillouin zone boundary ; these @xmath5-points contain the important low - energy vibrational modes responsible for disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we extract 100 realisations , each temporally separated by 0.25 ps , collected after an initial equilibration period . given the increased computational cost of this larger structure ( 96 versus 12 atoms ) , the electronic properties were calculated within the local density approximation ( lda ) including spin - orbit coupling . while our intent is to show the qualitative effect of disorder on the magnitude of the spin - split indirect - gap and the effective masses , the lda results for the ordered cells are in reasonable agreement with qs__gw _ _ ( table [ table : effectivemass ] ) .    between molecular dynamics snapshots , the spin - split band extrema and effective masses fluctuate . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from values averaged over the 100 instances ( table [ table : effectivemass ] ) , disorder causes the light effective masses to increase . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain the observed reduction in mobility as a function of temperature , in the temperature regime where the organic moieties are increasingly disordered . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the band minima spin - split @xmath12 _ also _ increases with disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the cage deformation plays a more important role in generating the directional electric field than the ordering of the moiety dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> this is indirectly supported by the success of the formamidinium based perovskites , with smaller dipoles but larger anisotropy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the model presented here shows good agreement with experiment , other mechanisms that suppress bimolecular recombination may be operative . in particular , electric fields generated by local ferroelectric domains or defect segregation could separate electrons and holes in _ real _ space @xcite , in contrast to the present work , where is suppressed by separation in _ reciprocal _ space . both mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> could contribute simultaneously to reduced recombination . </S>",
    "<S> we pointed to a limited body of evidence to support the latter ; along these lines it is noteworthy that high power conversion efficiencies have been reported only for lead - based halide perovskites . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the spin - split indirect - gap picture , as soc is weaker in lighter elements such as sn . in principle </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to obtain experimental evidence for the direct / indirect - gap picture , with optical probes of the ( weakly emissive ) indirect gap . </S>",
    "<S> sensitive photoluminescence ( pl ) or electroluminescence ( el ) would probe the emission from this state , absorption can be probed by sensitive external quantum efficiency ( eqe ) or photo - deflection spectroscopy ( pds ) . in our idealized structure </S>",
    "<S> we predict the splitting to be 75 mev , while in the actual , disordered case it will vary with the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect the splitting to decrease with temperature .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have provided a fully _ ab initio _ relativistic calculation of the hybrid halide perovskite radiative recombination lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> we considered only direct recombination , and with electron and hole populations described by a quasi - fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the bimolecular recombination rate is strongly temperature and carrier density sensitive , and that the long carrier lifetime and diffusion length are a direct consequence of large relativistic spin - orbit coupling combined with internal electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the relevant electric fields are mainly generated by dynamic deformation of the inorganic octahedral cage . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - split indirect - gap is generated by the pb lone - pair driven distortions , and the pb spin - orbit coupling of the conduction band . for perovskite alloys , for example formamidinium / methylammonium / caesium and iodine / bromine , the additional symmetry breaking due to occupational site disorder would be expected to further enhance these effects , which is consistent with their strong photovoltaic action .    </S>",
