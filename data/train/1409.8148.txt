    "in this talk , i review some recent developments of the svz sum rules , which i often call _ qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr ) _ instead of the popular name _ qcd sum rules _ for two reasons : the word _",
    "spectral _ is essential as one works in this approach with spectral functions .",
    "the 2nd reason is that _ qssr _ is near the abbreviation of the former soviet union state ( ussr ) from which originally come the three inventors of this method . to my opinion ,",
    "the svz sum rule @xcite is one of the most important discovery of the 20th century in high energy physics phenomenology ( sakurai price to svz in 1999 , pomeranchuck prices in 2010 for v. zakharov and in 2013 for m. shifman ) with a wide successful spectrum of applications in hadron physics @xcite as it permits to tackle in a semi - analytic way the complicated hadron dynamics using the qcd fundamental parameters despite our  poor understanding \" of qcd confinement .",
    "the approaches of spectral sum rules are not new . in the year of 60 - 70 , there were many different sum rules based on the old idea of duality @xcite , superconvergence @xcite and smearing @xcite . some attempts to improve these pre - qcd sum rules using perturbative qcd have been done @xcite using finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) contour techniques  la shankar @xcite for testing the breaking of the convergence of the weinberg sum rules @xcite when the perturbative current quark masses are switch on . as a consequence , some combinations of superconvergent sum rules for non - zero light quark masses have been proposed @xcite . in the same period , svz have presented a new sum rule with an exponential weight which permits to optimize the contribution of the low - energy region of the sum rule but has also extended the qcd results to lower energy by including , via an operator product expansion ( ope ) , non - perturbative condensates which can mimics in this region the main features of qcd confinement .",
    "from these short historical reminders , the svz sum rules are , like its predecessors , alternative improvements of the well - known kllen - lehmann dispersion relation , which for a hadronic two - point correlator @xmath3 reads : ( q^2)&&id^4x  e^iqx0| t j(x ) j^(0)|0 + & = & _ t_<^dtt+q^2+i1im ( t)+ ... [ eq : dispersion ] where @xmath4 , ... means arbitrary subtraction terms which are ( in general ) polynomial in @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is any hadronic current with definite quantum numbers built from quarks and/or gluon fields ; @xmath7 is the hadronic threshold .",
    "this well - known dispersion relation is a very important _ bridge between theory and experiment _ as it relates @xmath3 ( which can be calculated in qcd provided that @xmath5 is much larger than the qcd scale @xmath8 ) , with its imaginary part @xmath9 which can be measured at low energy from experiments . at present",
    ", there are different variants of qcd spectral sum rules in the literature .",
    "they have been mainly inspired from fesr @xcite and @xmath0-decay semi - hadronic width @xcite .      in this paper , we shall concentrate on the recent and modern applications of the original borel / laplace or exponential most popular svz sum rules@xcite : ( ) = _ t_<^ dt  e^-t  1im ( t )  .",
    "[ eq : lapl ] this sum rule is obtained when one takes an infinite number of derivatives @xmath10 of the correlator in @xmath5 but keeping the ratio @xmath11 ( sum rule variable ) fixed in the dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) . in this way",
    ", one can eliminate the substraction terms ( polynomial in @xmath5 ) and the dispersion becomes an exponential sum rule which has the nice feature to enhance the lowest resonance contribution and to suppress the ones of higher hadron masses ( similar exponential suppression is used on the lattice for extracting the lowest meson parameters ) .",
    "another related sum rules are the ratio and double ratios of sum rules : ( ) -dd ( )  and   r_ij = r_i_j  , [ eq : ratio ] for two different channels @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the former is often used in the literature for extracting the lowest ground state hadron mass as at the optimization point ( discussed later on ) @xmath14 where we have a cancellation of the leading @xmath15 pt corrections , while the second is useful for extracting with a good accuracy the splittings of hadron masses due , in addition , to the cancellation of the leading non - flavoured terms in the qcd expression of the sum rule  @xcite .",
    "the svz ideas are not only related to the discovery of sum rules . more important , they have proposed a new way to phenomenologically parametrize ( approximately ) the non - perturbative ( confinement ) aspect of qcd beyond perturbation theory using an operator product expansion ( ope )  la wilson in terms of the vacuum condensates of quark or / and gluons of higher and higher dimensions . in this way , the two - point correlator can be parametrized as : ( q^2 ) = _ d=0,2,4 , ...",
    "c_d 0| o_d |0q^d  , where @xmath16 is the dimension of the non - perturbative condensates @xmath17 and @xmath18 the corresponding wilson coefficients calculable using perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "they are classified in table [ tab : param ] with their fitted values from hadronic data .",
    "in addition to the well - known quark condensate @xmath19 entering to the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation : @xmath20 svz@xcite have advocated the non - zero value of the gluon condensate @xmath21 ( which they have found to be 0.04 gev@xmath22 from charmonium data ) and of some other higher dimension condensates .",
    "in a series of papers , zakharov et al @xcite have parametrized the contribution of the non - calculated large order terms of the pt series by the introduction of a quadratic term associated to the tachyonic gluon mass .",
    "the presence of this  operator \" is a priori shocking as a such term is forbidden by gauge invariance in qcd .",
    "however , this term is not of infrared origin like some other non - perturbative condensates but _ it is dual to the sum of higher order ultra - violet terms of the pt series_. better the series is known , lesser is the strength of this term which can vanishes after some high order terms of the pt series @xcite .",
    "its presence is seen in different dual ads / qcd models @xcite .",
    "however , its contribution in the sum rule analysis is tiny and can be quantified by the value of the tachyonic gluon mass @xmath23 from @xmath24 data @xcite , @xmath25-laplace sum rule @xcite , lattice data for the sum of pseudoscalar @xmath26 scalar two - point correlators @xcite : -(_s/ ) ^2 = ( 73)10 ^ -2  gev^2  .",
    "for the light vector and axial - vector channels , the spectral function i m @xmath27 can be measured inclusively from @xmath24 and @xmath28 data . in most cases , where hadron masses need to be predicted ,",
    "there are no data available .",
    "then , one often uses the minimal duality ansatz parametrization of the spectral function : f_r^2m_r^2n(t - m_r^2 )  i m ( t)_qcd  ( t - t_c )  , [ eq : ansatz ] where : @xmath29 is the resonance coupling to the current ; @xmath30 is related to the dimension of the current ; @xmath1 is the qcd continuum threshold .",
    "the qcd continuum comes from the discontinuity of the qcd diagrams in the ope in order to ensure the matching of the two sides of the sum rules at high - energies .",
    "the nave duality anstaz in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) works quite well in the different applications of the svz sum rules within the corresponding expected ( 10 - 20)% accuracy of the approach at lo of pt . a satisfactory test of this model from @xmath24 and",
    "charmonium data have been done in @xcite .",
    "if one uses the qcd expression of the correlator in the time - like region , the spectral function may oscillate@xcite and can slightly affect ( at the % level@xcite ) the result obtained from the sum rules .",
    "there are different steps for improving svz sum rules :      the question to ask is how one can approach the resonance mass for extracting an optimal information from the sum rules and in the same time the ope remains convergent .",
    "the original svz proposal is to find a window where the resonance contribution is bigger than the qcd continuum one and where the non - perurbative terms remain reasonnable corrections .",
    "numerically , the argument is handwaving as the percent of contribution to be fixed is arbitrary . in a series of papers ,",
    "bell and bertlmann @xcite have investigated this problem using the harmonic oscillator within the exponential moment sum rules .",
    "the analysis of the ratio of moments @xmath31 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillator ] , where one can observe that the exact solution ( ground state energy @xmath32 ) is reached when more and more terms of the series are added and the optimal information is reached at the minimum of @xmath31 for a truncated series .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiob ] , the @xmath0-behaviour of @xmath31 , in the bottomium channel , known to n2lo of pt qcd versus the sum rule variable @xmath0 for different truncation of the ope .",
    "the position of this minimum concide with the svz sum rule window but now it becomes more rigorous .     in gev versus @xmath0 in gev@xmath33 and for @xmath34 mev .",
    "the black continuous ( rep .",
    "short dashed ) curves are the experimental contribution including ( resp . without ) the qcd continuum ( it is about the @xmath35 ) .",
    "the green ( thick continuous ) is the pt contribution including the @xmath36 condensate to lo .",
    "the long dashed ( red ) curve is the contribution including the @xmath15 correction to the @xmath36 contribution .",
    "the short dashed ( blue ) curve is the qcd expression including the @xmath37 condensate and the dot - dashed ( red - wine ) is the qcd expression including the @xmath38 contribution .",
    ", width=245 ]      another free parameter in the phenomenological analysis is the value of the continuum threshold @xmath1 .",
    "many authors _ adjust its value _ at the intuitive mass of the next radial hadron excitation .",
    "this procedure can be false as the qcd continuum only smears all high mass radial excitations , and what is important is the area in the sum rule integral . as the value of @xmath1 is an external parameter like the @xmath0 sum rule variable",
    ", one can also require that the physical observables ( the lowest resonance parameters ) are insensitive to its change . in a such case , we consider the conservative value of @xmath1 from which one starts to have a @xmath0-stability until the one where one reaches a @xmath1 stability ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fb ] for the case of @xmath39 ) . in some cases",
    ", this @xmath1 stability is not reached due to the nave form of the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) . in this case , the complementary use of fesr can help due to the correlation between @xmath1 and the lowest resonance mass ( but not with the one of the radial excitation!)@xcite .",
    "another free parameter in any pt qcd analysis is the subtraction point @xmath2 at which the pt series are evaluated . like in the previous cases ,",
    "we consider a minimum sensitivity of the results versus its variation .",
    "this is signaled either by a stability plateau , an inflexion point or some extremas .",
    "some illustrative examples based on this criterion have been studied recently in series of papers @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpi ] the @xmath2 behaviour of the ratio @xmath40 used to determine the sum of light quark renomalization group invariant masses : @xmath41 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mud ] , where one can notice that the mean value @xmath42 from different values of @xmath2 corresponds to the inflexion point at @xmath43 gev @xcite ; we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdmu ] the @xmath2-behaviour of @xmath44 where a plateau in @xmath2 is obtained @xcite while the ones of the ratio @xmath45 and of @xmath46 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rbst ] and [ fig : fbc ] where , here , one has respectively a minimum and an inflexion point @xcite .     versus @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed region is similar as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpi].,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]     versus @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed region is the mean value with the weighted error while the two upper ( lower ) lines are when the error comes from the most precise one.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    .values of the pt qcd parameters from qssr : @xmath47 .",
    "the light running masses are evaluated at 2 gev . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "qssr phenomenology is vast and is discussed in details in the previous longer reviews and books @xcite .",
    "the common features emerging from these applications are the incredible success of the approach for predicting hadron properties using limited numbers of the universal and fundamental qcd parameters given in tables [ tab : param ] and [ tab : pert ] .",
    "this success has been reinforced by the precise extraction of @xmath15 from @xmath0-decay data @xcite .",
    "in addition to the results for the non - perturbative parameters in table [ tab : param ] , we show in table [ tab : pert ] the values of the pt running qcd parameters obtained from @xmath0-decays and qssr .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is in agreement with the world average and has first shows the running of @xmath15 from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the mass results are improvements of existing ones @xcite and , in general , agree with some other determinations @xcite , while the optimal lower bounds are new .",
    "the rle of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are essential for extracting the light quark masses from the pseudoscalar channels .",
    "however , one can notice _",
    "( en passant ) _ that the @xmath52 breaking ratio of condensates @xmath53 from different channels ( pseudoscalar @xcite , light @xcite and heavy@xcite baryons spectra ) and from various authors differs from recent lattice calculations @xmath54 @xcite which needs to be checked .",
    "we show in table [ tab : decay ] recent values and upper bounds of the heavy light decay constants obtained in @xcite .",
    "these results are in good agreement with older ones @xcite , with lattice calculations @xcite and other recent qssr estimates @xcite .",
    "exotics , especially charmonium and bottomium states have been intensively discussed these last few years ( see e.g. @xcite for molecules and four - quark states ; see e.g. @xcite for heavy and @xcite for light hybrid states ) . however , in most works for molecules and four - quark states , it is disappointing that the two - point correlator is only known at lo of pt qcd where the heavy quark masses used are ill - defined while some classes of non - perturbative condensates are known until dimension @xmath55 but some others like e.g. the gluon condensates contributions are not included in the ope .",
    "these weak points have been cured in recent works where n2lo pt corrections have been included @xcite which render more reliable the qssr predictions .",
    "the observed @xmath56 and @xmath57 almost concides with the predictions 3738(152)mev and 10687(232)mev for @xmath58 and @xmath59@xmath60 molecules , while , the experimental candidates @xmath61 and @xmath62 are too light compared with the prediction of @xmath63mev for a pure @xmath64@xmath65 molecular state .",
    "another recent qssr application is the eventual possibility for the @xmath66-meson to be the lowest scalar gluonium while its large coupling to @xmath67 and to @xmath68 can be due to the large violation of the ozi rule at this low energy .",
    "this result has been deduced by comparing qssr predictions for a glueball mass around 1 gev @xcite needed for a self - consistency of the ( un)subtracted sum rules ( similar result is found from lattice and a njl model @xcite ) with the phenomenological analysis of @xmath69 and @xmath70 scattering data using k - matrix approach which can separate the pole from the rescattering contribution @xcite .",
    "this feature of the @xmath66 has to be contrasted to the favoured g(1.6 ) glueball candidate where at this energy one expects a much better realization of the ozi rule such that it is expected to decay into pairs of @xmath71 gluonic states but couples weakly to goldstone pairs @xcite .",
    "we have presented in a compact form the developments of qcd spectral sum rules 35 years later .",
    "values of the qcd parameters and some decay constants from qssr are summarized in table [ tab : param ] to [ tab : decay ] .",
    "its applications are rich and have the advantage ( compared to lattice simulations ) to be analytical where one can control the size of different contributions .",
    "the successful applications of the sum rules motivate further studies and improvements of the approach by e.g. incuding radiative and quadratic corrections .      for a review , see e.g. : s. narison , _ cambridge monogr . part .",
