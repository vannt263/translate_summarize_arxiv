    "@xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall only give a minimal amount of background and we shall not discuss previous works , so as to avoid redundancy with the previous articles in the series .",
    "one can think of these wasserstein spaces as geometric measure theory analogues of @xmath2 spaces ( here with @xmath3 ) , but they recall much more of the geometry of @xmath0 . our goal is to understand precisely how the geometric properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related .",
    "our setting here is at the intersection of the previous papers @xcite and @xcite : as in the later we assume @xmath0 is a hadamard space , by which we mean a globally @xmath4 , complete , locally compact space , and as in the former we consider the isometry group of @xmath1 .",
    "note that a weaker result concerning the isometric rigidity was included in a previous preprint version of @xcite , which has been divided due to length issues after a remark from a referee .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that the isometry group of @xmath5 is strictly larger than the isometry group of @xmath6 itself , the case @xmath7 being the most striking : some isometries of @xmath8 are exotic in the sense that they do not preserve the shape of measures .",
    "this property seems pretty uncommon , and our main result is the following .",
    "[ theo : intro : isometry ] if @xmath0 is a negatively curved geodesically complete hadamard space then @xmath1 is isometrically rigid in the sense that its only isometries are those induced by the isometries of @xmath0 itself .    by `` negatively curved '' we mean that @xmath0 is not a line and the @xmath4 inequality is strict except for triangles all of whose vertices are aligned ,",
    "see section [ had ] for details .",
    "as stated , our proof of theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] depends on strong , yet unpublished results of lytchak and nagano @xcite ; but we shall treat many cases ( manifolds , trees , some more general polyhedral complexes ) without resorting to @xcite .    in",
    "the process of proving theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] , we also get the following result that seems interesting by itself .",
    "[ theo : side ] let @xmath9 be geodesic polish spaces and assume that @xmath10 is geodesically complete and locally compact .",
    "then @xmath11 is isometric to @xmath12 if and only if @xmath10 is isometric to @xmath13 .",
    "it is quite surprising that whether a fully general version of this result holds is an open question .",
    "note that the proof of theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] involves the inversion of some kind of radon transform , that seems to be new ( for trees it is in particular different from the horocycle radon transform ) and could be of interest for other problems .      in this preliminary section , for the sake of self - containment , we briefly recall well - known general facts on hadamard and wasserstein spaces .",
    "one can refer to @xcite and @xcite for proofs , further details and much more .",
    "given a polish ( _ i.e. _ complete and separable metric ) space @xmath0 , one defines its ( quadratic ) wasserstein space @xmath1 as the set of borel probability measures @xmath14 on @xmath0 that satisfy @xmath15 for some ( hence all ) point @xmath16 , equipped by the distance @xmath17 defined by : @xmath18 where the infimum is taken over all measures @xmath19 on @xmath20 whose marginals are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "such a measure is called a transport plan and is said to be optimal if it achieves the infimum . in this setting , optimal plans always exist and @xmath17 turns @xmath1 into a metric space .      given any three points @xmath23 in a geodesic polish metric space @xmath0 ,",
    "there is up to congruence a unique comparison triangle @xmath24 in @xmath25 , that is a triangle that satisfies @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "one says that @xmath0 has ( globally ) _ non - positive curvature _ ( in the sense of alexandrov ) , or is @xmath4 , if for all @xmath23 the distances between two points on sides of this triangle is lesser than or equal to the distance between the corresponding points in the comparison triangle , see figure [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "note that some authors call this property `` globally @xmath4 '' .",
    "equivalently , @xmath0 is @xmath4 if for any triangle @xmath23 , any geodesic @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and any @xmath32 $ ] , the following inequality holds : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the length of @xmath29 ( which is equal to @xmath35 ) .",
    "we shall say that @xmath0 is a hadamard space if @xmath0 is @xmath4 , complete and locally compact . by the generalized cartan - hadamard theorem ,",
    "this implies that @xmath0 is simply connected .",
    "our goal is now , as said above , to study the isometry group of @xmath1 .",
    "we have a natural morphism @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the push - forward of measures : @xmath38 an isometry @xmath39 of @xmath1 is said to be _ trivial _ if it is in the image of @xmath40 , to _ preserve shape _ if for all @xmath41 there is an isometry @xmath42 of @xmath0 such that @xmath43 , and to be _",
    "exotic _ otherwise .",
    "when all isometries of @xmath1 are trivial , that is when @xmath40 is an isomorphism , we say that @xmath1 is _ isometrically rigid_.    when @xmath0 is euclidean , @xmath1 is not isometrically rigid as proved in @xcite .",
    "our main result , theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] can now be phrased as follows : if @xmath0 is a geodesically complete , negatively curved hadamard space , then @xmath1 is isometrically rigid .",
    "we first prove this assuming the set of regular points ( namely those whose tangent cone is isometric to a euclidean space plus an extra assumption if the dimension is one , see section [ blurb ] for a precise definition ) is a dense subset of @xmath0 .",
    "the density of regular points holds in many examples such as manifolds , simplicial trees , polyhedral complexes whose faces are endowed with hyperbolic metrics such as @xmath44 buildings .",
    "building on results of lytchak and nagano @xcite , we shall prove that the density of regular points holds true for _ any _ geodesically complete , negatively curved hadamard space , completing the proof of theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] .    to prove isometric rigidity ,",
    "we show first that an isometry must map dirac masses to dirac masses .",
    "the method is similar to that used in the euclidean case , and is valid for geodesically complete locally compact spaces without curvature assumption .",
    "it already yields theorem [ theo : side ] , answering positively in a wide setting the following question : if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are isometric , can one conclude that @xmath10 and @xmath13 are isometric ?    the second step is to prove that an isometry that fixes all dirac masses must map a measure supported on a geodesic to a measure supported on the same geodesic .",
    "here we use that @xmath0 has negative curvature : this property is known to be false in the euclidean case .    then as in @xcite we are reduced to prove the injectivity of a specific radon transform .",
    "the point is that this injectivity is known for @xmath45 and is easy to prove for trees , but seems not to be known for other spaces .",
    "we give a simple argument for manifolds , then extend it to spaces with a dense set of regular points .",
    "finally , we prove that all geodesically complete , negatively curved hadamard spaces have a dense set of regular points .",
    "in this section we reduce theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] to the injectivity of a kind of radon transform , and also prove theorem [ theo : side ] .",
    "the characterization of dirac masses follows from two lemmas , and can be carried out without any assumption on the curvature . on the contrary , the assumption of _ gedesic completeness _ ,",
    "namely that any geodesic can be extended to a ( minimizing ) geodesic defined on @xmath46 , is crucial .",
    "note that when we ask a space to be geodesically complete , we of course imply that it is geodesic .",
    "note that all geodesics are assumed to be parameterized with constant speed and to be globally minimizing .",
    "[ lem : extension ] let @xmath10 be a locally compact , geodesically complete polish space . any geodesic segment in @xmath11 issued from a dirac mass can be extended to a complete geodesic ray .",
    "let us recall the measurable selection theorem ( see for example @xcite , corollary of theorem 17 ) : any surjective measurable map between polish spaces admits a measurable right inverse provided its fibers are compact .",
    "consider the restriction map @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the set of geodesic segments parameterized on @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 is the set of complete rays ( geodesics are assumed here to be minimizing and to have constant , non - necessarily unitary , possibly zero speed and all sets of geodesics are endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets ) .",
    "the fiber of a geodesic segment @xmath29 is closed in the set @xmath51 of geodesic rays of speed @xmath52 starting at @xmath53 .",
    "this set is compact by arzela - ascoli theorem ( equicontinuity follows from the speed being fixed , while the pointwise relative compactness is a consequence of @xmath10 being locally compact and geodesic , hence proper ) .",
    "moreover the geodesic completeness implies the surjectivity of @xmath54 .",
    "there is therefore a measurable right inverse @xmath55 of @xmath54 : it maps a geodesic segment @xmath29 to a complete ray whose restriction to @xmath49 $ ] is @xmath29 .",

    "for @xmath60 $ ] , let @xmath61 be the evaluation map at time @xmath62 .",
    "we know from the theory of optimal transport that there is a measure @xmath63 on @xmath48 such that @xmath64 , called the displacement interpolation of the geodesic segment .",

    "we therefore denote by @xmath69 the measure @xmath70 on @xmath0 ; for @xmath71 , we retrieve the original mesure @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath72 now defines a geodesic ray : since there is only one transport plan from a dirac mass to any fixed measure , @xmath73 .",
    "moreover the transport plan from @xmath69 to @xmath74 deduced from @xmath14 gives @xmath75 .",
    "but the triangular inequality applied to @xmath21 , @xmath69 and @xmath74 implies @xmath76 and we are done .",

    "but this is forbidden by the negative curvature assumption .",
    "a similar argument can be worked out in the case when @xmath96 induces an involution : given @xmath151 and their midpoint @xmath145 , one can find measures @xmath139 supported on @xmath83 and @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath139 has more mass on @xmath152 than on @xmath83 , such that @xmath154 is supported on @xmath146 and a point @xmath155 of @xmath29 , with more mass on @xmath155 .",

    "we can construct inductively a family @xmath229 of geodesics chosen as above , and such that their velocity vectors at @xmath173 span its tangent space @xmath230 which is isometric to @xmath231 .",

    "@xmath234 , and considering @xmath235 we get @xmath236 .    it remains to treat the case when @xmath201 is isometric to @xmath237 .",
    "recall that in that case , we further assume the existence of an open neighborhood @xmath238 of @xmath173 isometric to a short open segment .",
    "it is then clear that choosing any geodesic @xmath29 going through @xmath173 , @xmath239 for any @xmath240 .",

    "this is a consequence of deep results of lytchak and nagano @xcite on the structure of spaces with an upper curvature bound .      in this section ,",
    "we report the results we need from the paper @xcite , some of these results are also contained in @xcite .",
    "we then use them below to complete the proof of theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] in the general case . for simplicity",
    ", we give the statements for a geodesically complete hadamard space @xmath0 only , see @xcite for the full results .",
    "given @xmath193 a relatively compact open subset of @xmath0 , the authors introduce the set of _",
    "points @xmath242 defined by    @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a metric space and @xmath245 is the spherical join of @xmath246 and @xmath13 .",
    "we shall use the following results they prove :    [ ln1 ] let @xmath193 be a locally compact open subset of @xmath0 .",
    "then , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath247 satisfies @xmath248    ( this is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) . )    [ ln2 ] let @xmath193 be a relatively compact open subset of @xmath0 and assume that @xmath249 .",

    "let @xmath193 be a relatively compact open subset of @xmath0 .",
    "then , there exists an integer @xmath251 such that @xmath252 .",
    "moreover , the geometric dimension of @xmath193 coincides with its hausdorff dimension , namely @xmath253 .",

    "thus , it suffices to convince oneself that @xmath258 to this aim , lytchak and nagano prove that @xmath259 is a doubling metric space ( contrary to what precedes , this is strongly based on the geodesic completeness assumption ) .",
    "this property easily implies ( [ rdim ] ) .      in this section",
    ", we use the tools described above to prove the following statement , completing the proof of theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] .",

    ", we have to prove that @xmath59 is in the closure of @xmath195 .",
    "we first introduce a definition : we call the minimal dimension of a neighborhood of @xmath59 the _ local dimension _ at @xmath59 and denote it by @xmath261 ; moreover there is an open , relatively compact neighborhood @xmath193 of @xmath59 such that @xmath262 . to see this , recall that @xmath0 must have relatively compact balls , and apply theorem [ ln3 ] to @xmath263 :",
    "it is a decreasing sequence with positive integer value , thus has a limit which is reached for some @xmath197 .",
    "moreover , we get that @xmath261 is also the hausdorff dimension of @xmath193 .",
    "the theorem follows from two claims : first @xmath264 , second @xmath59 is in the closure of @xmath265 .    to prove the first claim ,",
    "observe that if @xmath13 is any non - empty space , the compactness of @xmath266 then yields that @xmath267 has dimension at least @xmath261 ; since @xmath268 , this shows that all points of @xmath265 have their space of direction isometric to @xmath269 . when @xmath270 , lemma [ ln2 ] further ensures that points in @xmath265 have a neighborhood isometric to an interval , proving the claim .",
    "we prove the second claim by contradiction . if @xmath59 were not in the closure of @xmath265 , by theorem [ ln1 ] it would lie in an open set @xmath271 of hausdorff dimension less than @xmath261 . by theorem [ ln3 ] , @xmath272 has dimension less than @xmath261 , contradicting the definition of local dimension .",
    "in this appendix we prove a side result , not needed in the proof of theorem [ theo : intro : isometry ] , showing that in the case of simplicial trees one can explicitly inverse the radon transform introduced above .",
    "let @xmath0 be a locally finite tree that is not a line .",
    "we describe @xmath0 by a couple @xmath273 where @xmath238 is the set of vertices ; @xmath274 is the set of edges , each endowed with one or two endpoints in @xmath238 and a length .    for all @xmath275 , let @xmath276 be the valency of @xmath59 , that is the number of edges incident to @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that no vertex has valency @xmath172 , since otherwise we could describe the same metric space by a simpler graph .",
    "note also that edges with only one endpoint have infinite length since @xmath0 is assumed to be complete .    in this",
    "setting , @xmath0 is geodesically complete if and only if it has no leaf ( vertex of valency @xmath85 ) .",
    "assume this , and let @xmath29 be a complete geodesic .",
    "if @xmath59 is a vertex lying on @xmath29 and @xmath277 are the connected components of @xmath278 , let @xmath279 be the union of @xmath59 and of the @xmath280 not meeting @xmath29 ( see figure [ fig : perpendicular ] ) .",
    "it inherits a tree structure from @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , @xmath279 depends only upon the two edges @xmath281 of @xmath29 that are incident to @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore let @xmath282 .",
    "a measure @xmath41 can be decomposed into a part supported outside vertices , which is obviously determined by the projections of @xmath14 on the various geodesics of @xmath0 , and an atomic part supported on vertices .",

    "two maps @xmath294 such that @xmath295 and @xmath296 are equal .",
    "more precisely , we can recover @xmath291 from @xmath297 by the following inversion formula : @xmath298 where the first sum is over the set of pairs of edges incident to @xmath59 .",
