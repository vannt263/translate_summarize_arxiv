    "one of the most important features of quantum mechanics is the einstein - podolsky - rosen  @xcite effect , in which strong correlations are observed between presently noninteracting particles that have interacted in the past .",

    "experiments on _ entangled _ particle states have verified the ` nonlocal ' nature of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "one disturbing feature of the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics is that the nonlocal nature of the entanglement process has been divorced from our common intuitive ideas about spacetime events and causality .",
    "the standard interpretation asserts that for photons ( or electrons ) positioned at a and b , separated by a spacelike distance , there is no exchange of classical information and superluminal signals between a and b are impossible according to special relativity . with the advent of the possibility of constructing quantum computers and performing ` teleportation ' experiments , the whole issue of the spacetime reality of the epr process becomes more problematic .",
    "there exists also the fundamental puzzle that contemporary quantum mechanics is nonlocal on a macroscopic level , whereas gravitation described by einstein s general relativity ( gr ) is a strictly local macroscopic theory .",
    "this causes a tension to exist between the two fundamental pillars of modern physics  @xcite .",
    "we can adopt three possible positions :    1 .",
    "there is no problem .",
    "quantum mechanics is nonlocal and we should accept that there is no possible causal phenomenon associated with a space and time interpretation of entanglement as dictated by classical special relativity and bell s inequality  @xcite .",

    "classical spacetime locally described by a flat , minkowskian metric with one light cone , is not adequate to explain the physics of quantum entanglement . the standard , classical description of spacetime must be extended when quantum mechanical systems are measured .    according to ( 1 )",
    "quantum entanglement is a _ purely quantum phenomenon _ and",
    "classical concepts associated with causally connected events in space are absent .",
    "this is the point of view advocated by practitioners of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "one should abandon any notion that physical space plays a significant role for distant correlations of entangled quantum states .",
    "for those who remain troubled by this abandonment of a causal spatial connection between entangled states , it is not clear how attempting to change quantum mechanics would help matters .",
    "this leaves the possibility ( 3 ) that classical special relativity is too restrictive to allow for a complete spacetime , causal description of quantum entanglement .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt position ( 3 ) and propose a scenario based on a ` bimetric ' description of spacetime .",
