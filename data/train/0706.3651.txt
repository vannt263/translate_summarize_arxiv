    "in 1932 , right after the discovery of the neutron , heisenberg @xcite tried to explain the nuclear force ( for instance , the proton - neutron interaction ) with the idea of  platzwechsel \" of a migrating particle , which had been known as the mechanism for the covalency in hydrogen molecule , first clarified by heitler and london in 1927 @xcite . this ",
    "molecule - type bonding \" mechanism can be written as @xmath12 since the  @xmath13 \" can not be identified to the neutron for obvious reasons , this idea was unsuccessful , and was abandoned . instead of a  migrating real \" particle ,",
    "yukawa @xcite introduced a  mediating virtual \" boson for explaining the nuclear force as @xmath14 this hypothetical particle was eventually discovered , and yukawa s idea of a mediating virtual particle was established as the fundamental concept for understanding all the forces including the electroweak interaction . in the present paper",
    "we point out that the @xmath7 meson , as a  real migrating \" particle , plays a unique role in producing strong bonding of nucleons as @xmath15 one can say that this is the revival of the forgotten heitler - london - heisenberg scheme for nuclear binding force . in the following sections we describe briefly how this view has come out from our theoretical studies of an exotic bound system @xmath4 .",
    "we also foresee perspectives of this view toward kaon condensation .",
    "full accounts of the results will be published soon @xcite .",
    "recently , exotic light nuclear systems involving a @xmath7 ( @xmath5 and @xmath16 ) meson as a constituent have been predicted based on phenomenologically constructed @xmath17 interactions @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient for this new family of nuclear states , often called _ kaonic nuclear clusters _ , is the strongly attractive @xmath18 @xmath19 interaction , which accommodates the @xmath20 bound state , identified to the known @xmath21 resonance in the @xmath22 channel ( hereafter , expressed as @xmath6 ) with a binding energy of @xmath23 = 27 mev and a width of @xmath24 = 40 mev @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath21 resonance is largely populated in the @xmath5 absorption at rest in @xmath25he  @xcite and also in nuclear emulsion @xcite , it is very likely to be the @xmath26 bound state .",
    "the @xmath19 interaction was also derived theoretically ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the most spectacular property of the predicted kaonic nuclei is in their extremely high densities ; the average density , @xmath27 @xmath28 , reaches about 3 times as much as the normal nuclear density @xmath29 @xmath28 .",
    "this is an enormous contrast to the normal nuclear systems , in which the nuclear density is always a constant .",
    "the @xmath7 produces extra binding of nucleons , which overcompensate the stiff nuclear incompressibility . in order to understand this feature we study the most fundamental unit , @xmath4 .",
    "the lightest system following the  @xmath30 ansatz \" , @xmath4 , was predicted to exist with @xmath31 mev/@xmath32 , @xmath23 = 48 mev and @xmath24 = 61 mev @xcite .",

    "the @xmath18-pair distribution has a shape closer to @xmath60 , whereas the @xmath43 part is widely distributed due to the smaller attractive interaction . when @xmath5 ( 1 ) resides with proton ( 2 ) with a probability of 0.5 , the @xmath18 component of the wave function @xmath64 in ( [ eq : phi ] ) dynamically increases to 1 due to the strong @xmath62 interaction .",

[ fig : pp2kx ] ( right ) .",
