    "in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in cavity optomechanical systems for a wide range of both experimental and theoretical investigations@xcite.the importance of optomechanical systems is due to their potential applications in different topics of physics.they are promising candidates for studying quantum effects in the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales@xcite , detection and interferometry of gravitational waves @xciteand measurement of small displacements@xcite . in a cavity",
    "optomechanical system the radiation pressure exerted by the electromagnetic field induces a coupling between the intensity of the cavity field and the mechanical motion of a movable mirror .",
    "it is pointed out that the necessary condition for observing quantum phenomena for the oscillating mirror , as a mesoscopic or macroscopic object , is the preparation of the mechanical oscillator at low phonon occupancy .",
    "although the ground state cooling of the mirror has not yet been achieved experimentally , it has been shown theoretically@xcite that the ground state cooling of the mirror is possible in the resolved sideband regime where the cavity bandwith is less than mechanical oscillation frequency of the mirror .",
    "another quantum phenomenon expected to be observed in optomechanical sytems is the mixing between the fluctuations of the cavity field around the steady state and the mechanical mode which leads to the normal mode splitting(nms ) in the displacement spectrum of the mirror@xcite .",
    "it is well known from cavity qed that nms is an absolute evidence of strong coupling between the subsytems with energy exchange taking place on a time scale faster than the decoherence of each mode .",
    "the appearance of nms in optomechanical systems is known as a direct consequence of ground state cooling of the mirror@xcite .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of optomechanical systems is their nonlinear optical peroperties .",
    "the strong interaction between the cavity filed and the mechanical oscillations makes the cavity behave like a nonlinear medium since the length of the cavity depends upon the intensity of the field in analogous way to the optical length of a nonlinear material@xcite .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that within the born - openheimer approximation the back action of the oscillating mirror in one edge of an optical fabry - perot cavity , driven by a nearly - resonant laser field , induces an intracavity kerr - like nonlinearity . besides this intrinsic nonlinearity ,",
    "the presence of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) @xcite or the optical kerr medium @xcite inside the cavity has opened up a new domain for combining nonlinear optics and optomechanics towards the enhancement of quantum effects .",
    "it has been demonstrated@xcite that the presence of an opa in the cavity causes a strong coupling between the oscillating mirror and the cavity mode resulting from increasing the intracavity photon number .",
    "thus the enhancement of radiation pressure - induced coupling not only considerably improves the cooling of the mechanical oscillator but also makes the observation of the nms of the movable mirror and the output field mode accesible@xcite . on the other hand , when the optomechanical cavity contains an optical kerr medium with @xmath0 nonlinearity , due to the photon - photon repulsion and the reduction of the cavity photon fluctuations , the normal mode splitting weakens and the effective temperature of the moving mirror increases@xcite .",
    "the above mentiond interesting results motivated us towards investigation of an optomechanical system which contains a nonlinear crystal consisting of a kerr medium and a degenerate opa .",
    "we will show that in the system under consideration the competition between the increasing of intracavity photon number due to the parametric gain process and the reduction of the number of photons due to the photon blockade mechanism arising from the presence of the kerr medium leads to some new interesting effects in the dynamics of the movable mirror in the low photon number limit and the resolved sideband regime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec.[sec1 ] we describe the model , derive the quantum langevin equations of motion for the system operators and find their steady - state mean values . in sec.[sec2 ] we linearize the quntum langevin equations of motion around the steady - state mean values , and analyze the stability conditions of the system . in sec.[sec3 ] we calculate the spectrum of small fluctuations in the position of the oscillating mirror , the effective frequency and effective damping rate of the mechanical oscilltor , and analyze the influence of the nonlinear gain and anharmonicity parameter on them . in sec.[field ] we investigate the influences of the parametric gain and kerr nonlinearity on the intensity and quadrature squeezing of the transmitted field . in sec.[ent ] we examine the entanglement between the optical and the mechanical mode .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec.[sum ] .",
    "we consider a kerr - down conversion optomechanical system composed of a degenerate opa and a nonlinear kerr medium placed within a fabry - perot cavity formed by a fixed partially transmitting mirror and one movable perfectly reflecting mirror in equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the movable mirror is free to move along the cavity axis and is treated as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with effective mass @xmath2 , frequency @xmath3 and energy decay rate @xmath4(where @xmath5 is the mechanical quality factor).the cavity field is coherently driven by an input laser field with frequency @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath7 through the fixed mirror .",
    "furthermore , the system is pumped by a coupling field to produce parametric oscillation and induce the kerr nonlinearity in the cavity . in our investigation",
    ", we restrict the model to the case of single - cavity and mechanical modes@xcite .",
    "the single cavity - mode assumption is justified in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , @xmath8 which @xmath9 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath10 is the cavity length in the absence of the cavity field .",
    "we also assume that the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity and the nonlinear parameter of the kerr medium are much smaller than the longitudinal - mode spacing in the cavity .",
    "furthermore , one can restrict to a single mechanical mode when the detection bandwidth is chosen such that it includes only a single , isolated , mechanical resonance and mode - mode coupling is negligible .",
    "it should be noted that in the adiabatic limit , the number of photons generated by the casimir , retardation , and doppler effects is negligible @xcite .        under these conditions , the total hamiltonian of the system in a frame rotating at the laser frquency @xmath6can be written as @xmath11 where ,    [ hamil ] @xmath12    the first two terms in @xmath13 are , respectively , the free hamiltonian of the cavity field with annihilation(creation ) operator @xmath14 and the movable mirror with resonance frequency @xmath3 and effective mass @xmath2 , the third term describes the optomechanical coupling between the cavity field and the mechanical oscillator due to radiation pressure force , and the last term in @xmath13 describes the driving of the intracavity mode with the input laser .",
    "also , the two terms in @xmath15 describes , respectively , the coupling of the intracavity field with the opa and the kerr medium ; @xmath16 is the nonlinear gain of the opa which is proportional to the pump power driving amplitude , @xmath17 is the phase of the field driving the opa , and @xmath18 is the anharmonicity parameter proportional to the third order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath19 of the kerr medium .",
    "the input laser field populates the intracavity mode through the partially transmitting mirror , then the photons in the cavity will exert a radiation pressure force on the movable mirror . in a realistic treatment of the dynamics of the system ,",
    "the cavity - field damping due to the photon - leakage through the incomplete mirror and the brownian noise associated with the coupling of the oscillating mirror to its thermal bath should be considered . using the input - output formalism of quantum optics@xcite",
    ", we can consider the effects of these sources of noise and dissipation in the quantum langevin equations of motion .",
    "for the given hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , we obtain the following nonlinear equations of motion    [ langevin ] @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the cavity decay rate through the input mirror and @xmath22 is the input vacuum noise operator that is charactrized by the following correlation functions @xcite    [ noise1 ] @xmath23    the brownian noise operator @xmath24 describes the heating of the mirror by the thermal bath at temperature @xmath25 and is characterized by the following correlation function @xcite @xmath26d\\omega,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state regime and in small fluctuations with respect to the steady state .",
    "thus we obtain the steady - state mean values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the new equilibrium position of the movable mirror and @xmath34 is the effective detuning of the cavity which includes both the radiation pressure and the kerr medium effects .",
    "it is obvious that the optical path and hence the cavity detuning are modified in an intensity - dependent way .",
    "the first modification which is a mechanical nonlinearity , arises from the radiation pressure - induced coupling between the movable mirror and the cavity field and the second modification comes from the presence of the nonlinear kerr medium in the optomechanical system .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite for a given sufficiently large pure @xmath19 nonlinearity inside an optical cavity , the effect of photon blockade occurs as a consequence of large phase shifts of the cavity detuning .",
    "it has also been predicted @xcite that the same photon - photon interaction can occur in the strong coupling regime in the optomechnaical systems . in our treatment",
    "the photon - photon interaction due to the radiation pressue is ignorable in comparison with photon - photon interaction due to the kerr nonlinearity . since @xmath35 satisfies a fifth - order equation , it can have five real solutions and hence the system may exhibit multistability for a certain range of parameters .",
    "in order to investigate the dynamics of the system , we need to study the dynamics of small fluctuations near the steady state .",
    "we assume that the nonlinearity in the system is weak and decompose each operator in eq.([langevin ] ) as the sum of its steady - state value and a small fluctuation with zero mean value , @xmath36 inserting the above linearized forms of the system operators into eq.([langevin ] ) , the linearized quantum langevin equations for the fluctuation operators take the form    [ fluc ] @xmath37    defining the cavity field quadratures @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the input noise quadratures @xmath40 and @xmath41 eq.([fluc ] ) can be written in the compact matrix form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vector of fluctuations , @xmath44 is the vector of noise sources and the matrix @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 here , we concentrate on the stationary properties of the system . for this purpose , we should consider the steady - state condition governed by eq.([matrixform ] ) . the system is stable only if the real part of all eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 are negative , which is also the requirement of the validity of the linearized method .",
    "the parameter region in which the system is stable can be obtained from the routh - hurwitz criterion@xcite , which gives the following three independent conditions :    @xmath48\\times\\omega_{m}^{2 } ( \\gamma_{m } + 2\\kappa)+ [ 2\\kappa   r_{1}\\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\omega_{m}^{2}(\\gamma_{m } + 4\\kappa^{2 } ) ] >   0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ routh1 ]    where we have defined @xmath49 and @xmath50 as    @xmath51",
    "since we are interested in the spectrum of fluctuations in position of the oscillating mirror in the presence of kerr - down conversion nonlinearity , it is convenient to solve the time - domain equation of motion ( [ matrixform ] ) by fourier transforming it into the frequency domain .",
    "the fourier transform of the time - domain operator @xmath52 is @xmath53 then solving the linearized quantum langevin equation for the position fluctuations of the oscillating mirror yields @xmath54 in which @xmath55,\\nonumber\\\\ f_{3}(\\omega)&=&f_{2}(-\\omega)^{*},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 @xmath57,\\nonumber\\\\   \\beta_{2}&=&-4g^{2}+\\delta_{1}^{2}-4\\eta^{2}|a_{s}|^{4}+ 4i g \\eta ( a_{s}^{2}e^{-i\\theta}-c.c.).\\nonumber\\\\   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in eq.([deltaq ] ) originates from the thermal noise while the second and third terms arise from the radiation pressure force .",
    "the displacement spectrum of the mirror is defined by @xmath58 using the following correlation functions in the frequency domain @xmath59 @xmath60\\delta(\\omega+\\omega),\\ ] ] the displacement spectrum of the oscillating mirror is obtained as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .      in order to determine the structure of the displacement spectrum of the moving mirror we need to determine the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath63 as the solution of eq.([matrixform ] ) in the frequency domain , or the zeros of @xmath64 in the denominator of coefficients in eq.([coefficient ] ) .",
    "first we assume that the radiation pressure coupling @xmath65 is zero and find the eigenvalues of @xmath63 as @xmath66 thus in the absence of optomechanical coupling the effective frequency of the normal modes depends on @xmath67 which is a function of nonlinear coefficiens @xmath18 , @xmath16 and intracavity intensity .",
    "now we assume that the optomechanical coupling @xmath65 is not zero , but the decay rates @xmath68 and @xmath21 are negligibly small in comparison with @xmath3 and @xmath67",
    ". then the zeros of @xmath64 are approximately given by @xmath69 hence , the kerr - down conversion medium can alter the radiation pressure contribution to the nms in two ways .",
    "firstly , both nonlinearity parameters @xmath16 and @xmath18 change the mean intracavity photon number considerably .",
    "secondly the parameter @xmath70 is a function of the gain and anharmonicity parameters .    in fig.[fig :",

    "it has been shown previously @xcite that within each optomechanical cavity the photon - phonon entanglement can be generated by means of radiation pressure .",
    "here we are interested in the generation of stationary entanglement between the movable mirror and the cavity field in the presence of kerr - down conversion medium . since our system is in a gaussian state and the linear nature of eq.([matrixform ] )",
    "preserves the gaussian nature of the initial state of the system , we can use the logarithmic negativity measure @xcite to quantify the entanglement .",
    "when the stability conditions of eq.([routh1 ] ) are fulfilled , we can solve eq.([matrixform ] ) for the @xmath157 stationary correlation correlation matrix ( cm ) @xmath158 @xmath159 where the elements of the correlation matrix @xmath158 are defined as @xmath160 and @xmath161 $ ] is the diagonal diffusion matrix in which we used the following apporximation @xmath162 where @xmath163^{-1}$ ] .",
    "then the photon - phonon entanglement can be quantified by the logarithmic negativity @xmath164 as @xmath165,,\\ ] ] where @xmath166^{1/2}$ ] , is the lowest symplectic eigenvalue of the partialtranspose of the @xmath167 cm , @xmath158 , with @xmath168 , and we used the @xmath169 block form of the cm @xmath170 with @xmath171 associated to the oscillating mirror , @xmath172 to the cavity mode , and @xmath173 describing the optomechanical correlations .     versus the normalized detuning @xmath130 for @xmath174 ( green thick curve ) , @xmath175(red dashed - dotted curve ) , @xmath176(blue dashed curve ) and @xmath177(orange thin curve ) .",

    "we have plotted @xmath164 versus the normalized detuning @xmath130 for a bare cavity , a cavity that contains only the kerr medium , a cavity that contains only the gain medium and a cavity that contains both the kerr and gain medium .",
    "we see that , as expected , while the kerr medium reduces the degree of phonon - photon entanglement , the gain medium increases it considerably .",
    "this result arises from the fact that the radiation pressure , which is responsible for the phonon - photon entanglement , increases considerably in the presence of the gain nonlinearity while decreases in the presence of the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "therefore similarly to what happens for the mirror cooling process there is a competition between the gain and kerr nonlinearities for increasing and decreasing quantum effects , respectively . in fig.[fig : figent2 ] we have plotted @xmath164 versus the normalized detuning for different values of the gain nonlinearity .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath16 increases the degree of entanglement increases .",
    "it should be noted that we can not increase @xmath16 arbitrarily because of the stability condition of the system .",
    "in this paper we considered the canonical optomechanical cavity composed of a partiallly transmitting mirror and one perfectly reflecting movable mirror containing a kerr - down conversion nonlinear medium .",
    "for this system we investigated the influence of the two nonlinearities on the dynamics of the oscillating mirror , the intensity and squeezing spectra of the transmitted field and the steady - state mirror - field entanglement . for the dynamics of the oscillating mirror",
    "we have found that in the peresence of the two nonlinearities , there is a competition between the two quantum processes ; the splitting of the pump photons in two degenerate subharmonic photons as well as increasing the intracavity photon number due to the nonlinear gain medium , and shifting the energy level of the cavity proportional to the anharmonicity parameter @xmath18 which blocks the entrance of a large number of photons into the cavity .",
    "this competition can lead to enhancement of the radiation pressure contribution to the normal modes of the cavity and nms below the threshold @xmath183 .",
    "also , it was demonstrated that in the presence of the kerr - down conversion nonlinearity the ground - state cooling of the mechanical mirror is possible .",
    "although with increasing the anharmonicity parameter @xmath18 the vibrational excitation and effective temperature of the mirror increases , the enhancement of the gain medium can compensate the increasing of the phonon number to some extent . in the investigation of the intensity spectrum and quadrature squeezing of the transmitted field",
    ", it was shown that the range of response frequency of the field undergoes a shift because of anharmonicity parameter @xmath18 but in this range of the frequency both the kerr and gain media increase the degree of squeezing . finally , we investigated the influence of the kerr - down conversion on the degree of stationary entanglement between the cavity and the mechanical modes .",
    "it was shown that the kerr nonlinearity reduces the degree of entanglement considerably , while the gain medium increases it .",
