    "four operating solar neutrino experiments ( chlorine@xcite , kamiokande@xcite , gallex@xcite ) and sage@xcite have detected neutrinos from nuclear fusion in the interior of the sun with approximately the numbers and energies expected from standard solar models@xcite . moreover ,",
    "sound speeds calculated from the standard solar models agree with the helioseismologically determined sound speeds to a rms accuracy of better than @xmath5% throughout essentially the entire sun@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , quantitative discrepancies have persisted for almost three decades between the predictions of the standard solar models and the observations of solar neutrino experiments@xcite .",
    "several suggested modifications of neutrino properties provide excellent fits to the existing solar neutrino data@xcite .    are there potential `` smoking gun '' indications of new physics ?",
    "yes , the most popular neutrino physics solution , the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite , predicts several characteristic and unique phenomena .",
    "the msw effect explains solar neutrino observations as the result of conversions in the solar interior of @xmath1 produced in nuclear reactions to the more difficult to detect @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "potentially decisive signatures of new physics that are suggested by the msw effect include observing that the sun is brighter in neutrinos at night ( the ` earth regeneration effect ' ) @xcite , detecting distortions in the incident solar neutrino energy spectrum@xcite , and observing that the flux of all types of neutrinos exceeds the flux of just electron type neutrinos@xcite . a demonstration that any of these phenomena exists would provide evidence for physics beyond the minimal standard electroweak model .",
    "the regeneration effect is an especially powerful diagnostic of new physics since no difference is predicted between the counting rates observed during the day and at night ( or , more generally , any dependence of the counting rate on the solar zeith angle ) by such popular alternatives to the msw effect as vacuum oscillations  @xcite , magnetic moment transitions  @xcite , or violations of the equivalence principle  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the sensitivity of new solar neutrino experiments , super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , icarus@xcite , borexino @xcite , heron @xcite and hellaz @xcite , to the earth regeneration effect .",
    "the msw effect predicts that , for certain values of the neutrino masses and mixing angles , @xmath0 interactions in the earth ( at night ) may convert @xmath2 or @xmath3 from the sun back into the more easily detectable @xmath1 .    an accurate evaluation of the systematic significance of experimental results will require the detailed monte carlo simulations that will be carried out by the experimental collaborations ; the collaborations will determine the best estimates and uncertainties for all the quantities that affect the experimental result",
    "these results will then be analyzed using computer codes that include the experimental details and which make use of optimal statistical techniques such as maximum likelihood analysis . in the absence of detailed monte carlo simulations of the experimental characteristics ( yet to be determined ) , we estimate in this paper the statistical significance of expected results by comparing the predictions of various msw scenarios with respect to the no - oscillation scenario including only statistical errors and analyzing the results with a @xmath6 statistic .",
    "the reader who wants to see the approximate power of the new experiments can turn immediately to fig .  [ isosigma ] , which shows the significance level ( statistical errors only ) with which new solar experiments could detect the regeneration effect .",

    "in addition to the familiar large mixing angle and small mixing angle msw solutions , we find an additional low solution ( large mixing angle , smaller neutrino mass difference ) that has an acceptable confidence level only when earth regeneration is included in the calculations .",
    "we then investigate the sensitivity of next - generation solar neutrino experiments to the earth regeneration effect .",
    "we begin by defining and calculating the zenith - angle exposure function in sec .",

    "this function depends only on the location of a neutrino detector on the surface of the earth ; it is independent of the characteristics of the detector .",

    "[ spectrum ] the moments of the electron recoil energy spectrum for super - kamiokande and sno that were computed including the earth regeneration effect .",
    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ modelsensitivity ] that the msw predictions for regeneration in the earth depend only slightly on the adopted density profile of the earth , the chemical composition of the earth , and the details of the solar model .",

    "[ equator ] the increase in the sensitivity to the regeneration effect that could be achieved by building detectors at the equator .",
    "we discuss and summarize our main results in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "we work in a two - neutrino mixing scheme involving @xmath1 ( produced in the sun ) and either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( produced by oscillations ) . soon after mikheyev and smirnov suggested the msw effect @xcite as a possible solution of the solar neutrino problems , several authors pointed out @xcite that day - night variations of the event rates in solar neutrino detectors could provide spectacular confirmation of the msw effect and thus of new physics .",
    "the msw solution of the solar neutrino problems requires that electron neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the center of the sun are converted to muon or tau neutrinos by interactions with solar electrons on their way from the interior of the sun to the detector on earth .",
    "the conversion in the sun is primarily a resonance phenomenon , which occurs at a specific density that corresponds to a definite neutrino energy ( for a specified neutrino mass difference ) .    during day - time , the higher - energy neutrinos arriving at earth are mostly @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) with some admixture of @xmath1 . at night - time , neutrinos must pass through the earth in order to reach the detector . as a result of traversing the earth , the fraction of the more easily detected @xmath1 increases because of the conversion of @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) to @xmath1 by neutrino oscillations .",
    "for the small mixing angle msw solution , interactions with electrons in the earth increase the effective mixing angle and enhance the conversion process .",
    "for the large mixing angle msw solution , the conversion of @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) to @xmath1 occurs by oscillations that are only slightly enhanced over vacuum mixing .",
    "this process of increasing in the earth the fraction of the neutrinos that are @xmath1 is called the `` regeneration effect '' and has the opposite effect to the conversion of @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) in the sun .",
    "because of the change of neutrino type in the earth , the msw mechanism predicts that solar neutrino detectors should generally measure higher event rates at night than during day - time .",
    "figure [ geometry ] illustrates a schematic view of a solar neutrino detector at the geographic latitude , @xmath8 . since the earth is spherically symmetric to @xmath9 , it is sufficient to consider the cross - section slice shown in the figure.% , which is not observable with existing or planned detectors . ]",
    "two lines determine the geometry : one line defines the zenith direction , and the other line is the trajectory of the neutrino .",
    "the zenith angle @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) between these two lines specifies the neutrino trajectory in the earth .",
    "the survival probability depends on the neutrino oscillation parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , on the neutrino energy , @xmath14 , and on the path ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) the neutrino travels through the earth .",
    "since @xmath10 changes due to the apparent motion of the sun , the neutrino survival probability should change with time as well , resulting in an asymmetric distortion of the angular distribution of events .",
    "real - time detectors , which record the times at which neutrinos interact within the detector , are best suited for studying the earth regeneration effect . in radiochemical experiments",
    "the time of detection is poorly known , since a typical run usually lasts between several weeks ( gallium ) and several months ( chlorine ) .",
    "kamiokande , a real - time neutrino electron scattering detector , did not see any signal for the earth regeneration effect .",
    "the kamiokande collaboration used this non - observation to rule out an important region in parameter space for which the predicted day - night asymmetry , or zenith - angle dependence , is large@xcite .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the kamiokande detector was insufficient to probe the full @xmath12 - @xmath13 parameter space for which there might be an appreciable day - night effect , measurable by super - kamiokande or sno .",
    "there are several calculations in the literature @xcite of the expected magnitude of the regeneration effect in future experiments .",
    "different groups of researchers have used different models of the earth in their calculations .",
    "no quantitative estimate has been made previously of the sensitivity of the measurable quantities to the adopted density profile of the earth ; each group has typically presented results using a specific density profile , often not the best available profile . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we describe direct numerical computations of the earth regeneration effect for six different models of the earth .",
    "thus we quantify the dependence of the calculated characteristics of the earth regeneration effect on the model of the earth and exhibit the corresponding uncertainties which turn out to be rather small .",
    "the density profiles in the six models of the earth are described in sec .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "the msw effect in the earth depends upon the electron number density as a function of radius . in this section , we determine best - estimates and a range of uncertainties for the total mass density and for the chemical composition .",
    "we use the best available earth models and chemical composition for most of the calculations performed in this paper , but we also carry out calculations for five older mass models in order to determine the uncertainties in the predicted msw effects that arise from uncertainties in the model of the earth s density profile . we use a best - estimate chemical composition for the core that is inferred from the seismological measurements . to test the sensitivity of the msw predictions to the assumed chemical composition of the earth , we make extreme assumptions that maximize or minimize the average charge to mass ratio and carry out calculations also for these extreme cases .",
    "the density distribution inside the earth is known with a precision of a few percent@xcite .",
    "a large set of seismic measurements has been used to obtain the most accurate model , prem@xcite ( the preliminary reference earth model ) , for the earth s density distribution .",
    "we will use the prem model for all of our best - estimate calculations .",
    "this model has also been used by lisi and montanino  @xcite as the basis of their recent analytic study of earth regeneration .",
    "other models are described in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . to determine the sensitivity to the assumed density profile",
    ", we have performed calculations with a representative set of six different earth models , all spherically symmetric and with the same radius , @xmath15 km .",
    "figure [ density ] shows the density profiles of the six earth models .",
    "the density distributions in these models are divided into five zones : a ) a crust with a thickness of a few tens of kilometers , b ) an upper mantle extending down from the crust to about 1000 km , c ) a lower mantle down to about 2900 km , d ) an outer core between 1250 km and 3480 km from the center , and e ) an inner core of radius @xmath16 km .",

    "the recent models given in @xcite and @xcite reproduce the total mass and moment of inertia with excellent precision . the older models @xcite",
    "give slightly worse fits to the mass and moment of inertia .",
    "the models listed in the third to sixth row in table  [ table ] are in conflict with seismological measurements .",
    "the set of six models represents a sample that allows for variations of the density distribution larger than the uncertainties in the prem model . as shown in sec .",

    "figure [ density ] shows that the largest differences between the six models of the earth are in the core , below 2000 km .",
    "the operating solar neutrino experiments , and those currently under development , are located at relatively high northern latitudes .",
    "solar neutrinos that are detected in these experiments never cross the inner core of the earth . among the real - time experiments that are currently operating or are under construction , super - kamiokande is most sensitive to the core distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the fraction of a year during which the neutrinos cross the outer core at the kamioka site is small ( @xmath17 7% ) .",
    "measurements of the propagation of seismological waves in the earth s interior and studies of the properties of minerals under high pressure , have been combined to determine the chemical composition of the earth s interior with relatively high accuracy @xcite . using the results of references",

    "have concluded@xcite that the minimum amount of iron in the core is @xmath23% .",
    "we determine a maximum value of @xmath24 in the core by assuming a composition of @xmath23% iron and @xmath25% light elements .",
