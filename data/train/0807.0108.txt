    "molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , where it serves as an important coolant and as a precursor for the formation of more complex molecules . in the cold and",
    "dilute interstellar medium no efficient gas phase routes exist for the formation of h@xmath0 .",
    "hence , the most likely route is to form the molecule on the surfaces of small dust particles .",
    "this process has been intensely studied over the past years @xcite .",
    "the general consensus is that molecular hydrogen can be formed by a diffusive langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism , in the very cold regions below @xmath120 k @xcite . at these low temperatures",
    "the hydrogen atoms are physisorbed on the dust particles , but can still easily move on the surface .",
    "once two atoms meet , they will react to form molecular hydrogen .",
    "if the surface temperature becomes too high , the residence time of atoms on the surface becomes so short that , at the low fluxes in the ism , the chance of two atoms meeting becomes negligible .",
    "observations show that molecular hydrogen is also formed in warmer areas ( @xmath2 20 k ) like photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) and post - shock regions",
    ". a possible mechanism at these conditions would be through an eley - rideal reaction where an incoming hydrogen atom reacts with another h atom that is chemically bound to the surface .",
    "since a considerable fraction of the interstellar grains is expected to consist of carbonaceous material , a popular model system for this process is hydrogen abstraction from graphite .",
    "this eley - rideal reaction has been studied by density functional theory ( dft ) and quantum wave packet calculations @xcite .",
    "based on these calculations several different mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the eley - rideal abstraction process .",
    "these include : direct eley - rideal @xcite , barrier - less abstraction of one hydrogen atom forming part of a para - dimer configuration @xcite and abstraction by rapidly diffusing h atoms in physisorbed states @xcite .",
    "however , due to computational limitations such detailed calculations are unable to take the full complexity of the h - graphite system into account .",
    "hence , in the calculations the flat surface approximation is often used and generally either none or only a single c atom on the simulated graphite surface were allowed to relax during the eley - rideal reaction .",
    "these simplifications are potentially problematic . by not allowing for relaxation of the c atoms on the surface zero barrier reaction channels , such as sticking of hydrogen atoms into specific dimer configuration @xcite",
    ", are in some cases artificially closed , making it impossible to evaluate the contributions from different proposed mechanisms to the eley - rideal abstraction process .",
    "calculations on the eley - rideal reaction by martinazzo and tantardini @xcite show a higher probability for reaction if the incoming h atom is 0.5 - 1.5   away from the target h atom instead of a direct hit on .",
    "this distance corresponds to the h - h distance in an ortho - dimer configuration ( see fig .",
    "1 ) on the graphite surface ( 1.42  ) . hence",
    ", surface corrugation and competing sticking reactions must be expected to influence the abstraction behavior . in these calculations , however , dimer formation was not a possible route since the flat surface approximation was used and only the carbon atom underneath the original hydrogen atom was allowed to relax .",
    "impact parameters corresponding to the para - dimer ( see fig .",
    "1 ) distance ( 2.84  ) were not included in the study .",
    "both experimental observations and theoretical calculations show that hydrogen atoms preferentially form adsorbate clusters on the graphite surface .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) investigations show that at a hydrogen atom coverage of @xmath1 0.5 @xmath3 more than 75 @xmath4 of all surface configurations are clusters @xcite .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1 85 @xmath4 of the hydrogen atoms are part of larger clusters .",
    "in particular , the existence of hydrogen dimer configurations has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "hornekr et al .",
    "@xcite identified two stable hydrogen dimer configurations on the graphite surface , an ortho - dimer and a para - dimer ( see fig .",
    "[ dimers ] ) .",
    "dft calculations show that formation of the para - dimer is barrierless and that formation of the ortho - dimer has a reduced barrier @xcite , which makes dimer formation a competing channel to eley - rideal abstraction at non - zero impact parameter .",
    "one set of experiments on the eley - rideal abstraction reaction forming hd has been reported @xcite . in these experiments",
    "a high cross section for the abstraction reaction was observed which varied from 17 @xmath5 at low coverage to 4 @xmath5 at high coverage .",
    "this variation in the cross section with coverage has been ascribed to a steering effect @xcite .",
    "however , other mechanisms could also contribute to the high cross section at low coverage .",
    "options include the barrier - less abstraction of one of the h atoms in a para - dimer configuration @xcite and abstraction by fast diffusing h atoms @xcite .",
    "we propose a further possibility , namely abstraction via a hydrogen dimer state , where the incoming atom is not immediately thermalized and some of its excess initial energy is used to overcome the barrier to h@xmath0 formation and desorption .",
    "the finding that adsorption into the hydrogen para - dimer state is barrierless @xcite make this a strong competing reaction channel .    hence , in total 5 different abstraction mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to eley - rideal abstraction of hydrogen on graphite :    1 .   direct eley - rideal @xcite .",
    "2 .   direct eley - rideal with steering @xcite .",
    "3 .   preferred direct eley - rideal with hydrogen atoms part of a para - dimer @xcite .",
    "4 .   a dimer mediated reaction where the incoming atom is first adsorbed into a dimer configuration and , before thermalizing to the substrate temperature , reacts with the other atom in the dimer to form h@xmath0 and desorb . 5 .",
    "eley - rideal reactions by fast diffusing h atoms in the physisorption state @xcite .",
    "however , due to the simplifications needed in the complex dft and quantum wave packet calculations a quantitative comparison between experimental data and theory has not been possible . in this paper",
    "we employ a hybrid approach in which we include the findings of ab - initio dft calculations in a monte carlo simulation program and then simulate eley - rideal abstraction experiments on a more realistic surface area with more complex hydrogen adsorbate configurations than what is possible in the dft and wave packet calculations . through this quantitative approach",
    "we aim to discriminate between the contributions of the different underlying mechanisms for hydrogen abstraction .",
    "the monte carlo simulation program is a so - called lattice - gas simulation program , where the atoms are confined to an adaptive grid depending on the initial coverage .",
    "the hydrogen atoms can chemisorb to the graphite surface at the sites directly on top of the carbon atoms as indicated in figure [ system ] .",
    "the puckering of the carbon atom upon chemisorption is included indirectly by using the barriers for chemisorption and binding energies from dft calculations that allow this motion .",
    "interaction between two hydrogen atoms is accounted for in a similar way as will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the hydrogen atoms can physisorb to the surface without a barrier .",
    "since the potential energy surface for physisorption is rather flat , there are probably no specific physisorption site , however since the lattice - gas model forces us to choose specific sites , we confine physisorption to the sites directly above the carbon atoms and an additional site at the center of the ring ( figure [ system ] ) .",
    "the simulation starts with a clean graphite surface .",
    "the first event will be a deposition attempt of the first atom .",
    "the time at which this attempt will occur is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of sites , @xmath8 is a random number between 0 and 1 , @xmath9 is the hydrogen flux in atoms per time per area , and @xmath10 is the current time .",
    "deposition times for subsequent sticking events are determined by the same expression ( eq .",
    "[ tdep ] ) .",
    "how the atoms will bind to the surface is determined by another random number and depends on the barrier for chemisorption in that specific position .",
    "if the site is already occupied by another hydrogen atom , an abstraction reaction is considered by comparing a boltzmann factor including the abstraction barrier against a random number . upon reaction",
    "both atoms will leave the surface in the form of h@xmath0 , else the incoming atom is deflected .",
    "the abstraction channel can be closed by making the barrier infinitely large .",
    "once hydrogen atoms populate the surface , they can diffuse , desorb , or recombine with other atoms to form h@xmath0 . for each surface hydrogen the time at which they will undergo one of these events is determined by @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the rate for diffusion , desorption , and reaction of atom @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "another random number determines which of the three events occur according to their relative probability of occurrence .",
    "reaction between two chemisorbed atoms can only occur if they form a dimer configuration .",
    "the rates are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the attempt frequency which is assumed to be 10@xmath18 hz for physisorbed atoms and 10@xmath19 hz for chemisorbed atoms @xcite and @xmath20 is the ` temperature ' of the atom that is involved .    in the experiments that we aim to reproduce ,",
    "the atoms arrive at the surface at normal incidence and at a temperature around 2000 k which is much higher than the surface temperature .",
    "furthermore , the atoms will gain energy due to the high binding energy if they chemisorb .",
    "the atoms will not be thermalized instantaneously , but will most likely gradually lose their energy to the substrate .",
    "the dissipation of the excess energy into the substrate is expected to be exponential @xcite . to reduce the computation complexity of the model we emulate this exponential energy loss by a simpler expression and use the following function to describe the temperature @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the surface and starting temperature respectively",
    ", @xmath24 is the time at which the atom has adsorbed on the surface .",
    "the sensitivity of the model to the exact functional form was checked and found to be small . for most cases we use @xmath25",
    "k , but also higher values of 7000 k and 10,000 k are considered , matching the binding energy of a monomer .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 can be chosen freely .",
    "[ therma ] studies the effect of this parameter .",
    "it displays the result of series of 10,000 simulations of one deposition event for a particular value of b. the top panel indicates the percentage of deposition attempts that resulted in sticking .",
    "the sticking fraction slowly approaches the monomer sticking barrier probability of 41 % for increasing @xmath26 .",
    "a value of @xmath26 above @xmath27 s@xmath28 for @xmath25 k is needed to get an initial sticking co - efficient in agreement with the experimental findings @xcite .",
    "finally , the bottom panel gives the relaxation time .",
    "for comparison shalashilin and jackson @xcite found for a hydrogen atom on a cu(111 ) surface that the thermal relaxation time is around 4 ps .",

    "notice that different functions for @xmath20 will result in a different expression for @xmath40 .",
    "as the order in @xmath10 increases , solving @xmath40 becomes more computationally expensive .",
    "the previous section described the general monte carlo algorithm . for all processes energy barriers",
    "are needed to determine the corresponding transition probabilities .",
    "these barriers are taken from independent dft calculations @xcite of the binding energies of the different configurations that are considered , sticking trajectories and diffusion trajectories . since",
    "many possible configurations are formed during the simulations , especially for high coverages , including all these different possibilities explicitly would make the monte carlo program very slow and would require a huge set of barriers that all have to be calculated independently . to overcome this problem a number of simplifications",
    "are introduced resulting in the following sets of energy barriers :      for the physisorption binding energy , the value of @xmath1 40 mev is used based on results from selective adsorption experiments @xcite . for diffusion",
    "an activation energy of 4 mev taken from @xcite was used .",
    "we will come back to this diffusion rate at the discussion of mechanism iv .",
    "for physisorbed atoms @xmath41 was used .      numerous different barriers for sticking of an isolated hydrogen atom ( a monomer ) into the chemisorption site on the graphite surface have been given .",
    "jeloaica and sidis found a barrier of @xmath10.2 ev using the coronene molecule as a model of a graphite surface @xcite .",
    "sha et al .",
    "obtained a barrier slightly above 0.2 ev using a slab super cell with 4 layers each containing 8 carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "hornekr et al .",
    "@xcite found a barrier for chemisorption into a monomer of 0.15 ev using a single layer super cell containing 32 carbon atoms .",
    "the influence of adding a second carbon layer was investigated and found to be negligible . using the same model surface a sticking barrier of 0.1 ev into the ortho - dimer and 0 ev into the para - dimer configurations",
    "were found .",
    "all possibilities for sticking into a trimer state , starting from the para - dimer , were seen to have non - zero sticking barriers between 0.1 and 0.15 ev . adding a fourth atom resulting in a triple para - dimer configuration again",
    "did not exhibit a barrier @xcite .",
    "barrierless sticking into the para - dimer state was also found by rougeau et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "even though there is a clear dependence on the local configuration of the impact site , we decided only to include variations in sticking barriers for dimers in the simulation .",
    "the program determines if the incoming atoms can form a dimer ignoring the larger configuration it might be part of and determines the barrier for sticking accordingly .",
    "this assumption will cause deviations between simulations and experimental results at high coverage , since it overestimates the formation of trimer configurations that contain para - dimers .",
    "no sticking barrier was used for physisorption of h atoms .",
    "the barriers for sticking used in the simulation are summarized in table [ echem ] .",
    "section [ sense ] tests the different mechanisms to their sensitivity to various input parameters .",

    "by comparing the results listed in table [ sumtable ] it is clear that a combination of mechanisms iv and v reproduces the experimental findings quite well . this section will discuss the influence of the parameter settings on the final result .",
    "the table already showed four different parameter choices varying the diffusion rate and the barrier for abstraction .",
    "the diffusion rate has , as mentioned before , a clear influence on the number of formed dimers , but it appears to have very little effect on the obtained cross sections for the mechanisms iv and v. lowering it to a very low value of @xmath42 s@xmath28 , which turns it into a combination of mechanisms i and iv , results in a lower cross section at low coverage .",
    "we found that reducing the diffusion rate even further eventually leads to a completely flat cross section and a very high pearson correlation coefficient . also for a pure mechanism v a higher diffusion rate gives a stronger coverage dependence of the cross section as was suggested by bonfanti et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the abstraction barrier has no effect on the dimer ratio , but it influences the cross section at low coverage .",
    "it generally gives a lower cross section for a higher barrier .",
    "for a pure mechanism i also a barrierless abstraction was considered ( see table [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "the cross section at low coverage did not raise to the values found in the experiments in this case .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 , which controls the thermalization of the sticking atoms , has a very narrow parameter range if only mechanism iv is considered .",
    "lower values than @xmath43 s@xmath28 result in very low sticking at low coverage and higher values will have only a limited effect on the cross section .",
    "if mechanism iv is used in combination with mechanism v the sticking will be increased because of the diffusion of the physisorbed atoms and also lower values than @xmath43 s@xmath28 can be used leading to a higher cross section for low deuterium exposure and high dimer ratios .",
    "the linearity in the initial hd mass spectrometer signal is however decreased .    adding mechanism iii as a third mechanism in the simulations",
    "had a negligible effect on the results .",
    "the cross section and initial signal curves remained unchanged within their uncertainties .",
    "the parameter , @xmath23 , which controls the initial energy of hydrogen atoms , has a different effect on the final results for the pure mechanism iv and the combination of iv and v. this parameter can not be controlled independently of @xmath26 , since the sticking probability is constrained within a certain window ( see fig .  [ therma ] ) . for a pure mechanism iv a increased value of @xmath23 results in a cross section which is too low and only weakly dependent on coverage .",
    "the correlation coefficient for the initial hd signal is higher as compared to @xmath23 = 2000 k. this parameter combination further shows an extremely high dimer ratio .",
    "only combinations of mechanism were found to yield similar high values .",
    "it appear that the high initial energy is only used to remove monomers and not for dimers to react or to desorb .",
    "the relaxation time is probably to fast for these events to occur .",
    "if a more elaborate implementation of this mechanism was considered , where the initial energy of atoms in dimers is high , because of their higher binding energy , the reaction from dimers would go up and the dimer ratio go down .",
    "the results would then probably closer resemble the @xmath23 = 2000 k results . for a combination of mechanisms",
    "@xmath23 has less of an effect . here",
    "only the saturation coverage shows a large change .",
    "finally we checked the influence of increasing the monomer sticking barrier to the value of 0.25 ev which is an upper value for the sticking barrier reported by other authors @xcite .",
    "this results in a higher cross section at low coverage and a higher dimer ratio in all simulated cases .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient of the initial mass spectrometer signal as a function of coverage goes down . in general",
    "this increase in the sticking barrier results in a better agreement with the experiments .",

    "good quantitative and qualitative agreement between the experimentally derived and the simulated eley - rideal abstraction cross sections are found if two different eley - rideal abstraction mechanisms are included .",
