    "over the past few years , rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling@xcite has attracted a considerable amount of attention both from the experimental and theoretical perspectives with the objective to better understand electrical and spin transport properties in disordered semiconductor systems at the nanoscale .",
    "@xcite one of the main reasons for this keen interest is that , from a practical point of view , nanodevices built from these systems present a high potential for technological applications , since in low - dimensional heterostructures with asymmetrically confined two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) the interaction between the spin and the electric charge can be controlled by external local electric fields.@xcite on the theoretical plane , the comprehension of these physical phenomena requires us to consider the complex dynamical interplay of charge and spin in confined nanostructures together with the motion of the carriers taking place in the presence of a disordered potential landscape .    in this context",
    ", 2degs under high perpendicular magnetic fields may constitute one of the preferred playgrounds for the fundamental study of rashba so interaction since the effect of disorder can be well captured semiclassically@xcite , with an electronic charge motion resulting from the combination of a fast cyclotron motion and a slow guiding center drift in the presence of an arbitrary potential energy . at low temperatures ,",
    "this characteristic motion is responsible for spectacular quantum signatures in macroscopic transport properties@xcite such as the well - known perfect quantization of the hall conductance together with the simultaneous vanishing of the longitudinal conductance .",
    "the origin of the hall plateaus can be found in the reservoir of localized states in the bulk of the system where the guiding center of the quantized cyclotron orbits drifts along quasiexclusively closed equipotential lines of the random potential landscape , by reason of the ineffective energy exchange between the two ( orbital and guiding ) degrees of freedom .",
    "simultaneously , macroscopic transport across the sample can only occur through the quasiballistic edge channels@xcite , as long as the chemical potential remains pinned away from the center of the disorder - broadened landau levels which corresponds to the percolation threshold for the disorder equipotential lines . at the plateaus transitions , a diffusive electronic propagation throughout the system sets in via a bulk percolating network of equipotential lines , with the electron at a single energy passing through several saddle points of the potential@xcite as recently evidenced experimentally by scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements.@xcite",
    "even though some previous works@xcite have already considered transport properties of 2degs with strong magnetic fields in the presence of rashba so interaction , none of them specifically addresses the peculiar quantum hall transport regime .",
    "a few theoretical papers have studied the problem of charge transport either in bulk clean systems@xcite or 2degs with simple confinement potential profiles@xcite ( quantum hall edge states toy model ) but , in general , little consideration has been given to the combined effects of rashba so coupling and zeeman interaction ( which also has to be included ) on the electronic bulk drift states .",
    "one of the main reasons is that one has to deal at high magnetic fields with the nonperturbative quantum problem of lifting the huge landau level degeneracy by long - range disorder , for which the usual techniques based on the formalism of perturbation theory turn out to be irrelevant .",
    "another difficulty resides in the formulation of a consistent transport theory , which requires including landau level mixing processes in the analysis , since the matrix elements of the current density necessarily relate adjacent landau levels .",
    "in addition , macroscopic transport coefficients at high magnetic fields are dominated by long range spatial inhomogeneities . as a consequence , experimentally measured ( macroscopic ) conductances are no longer related to ( microscopic ) conductivities by simple dimensional factors given by the sample geometry@xcite , but present percolation features characterizing the fractal nature of the global transport network . in this line",
    ", it has also been suggested@xcite that disordered quantum hall systems with so coupling may belong to a different universality class from spin - degenerate electron systems since they may present different critical exponent for the percolation correlation length under certain circumstances .",
    "the understanding of the nontrivial physics of quantum hall systems in the presence of rashba and zeeman couplings is also crucial to explore the spin ( angular momentum ) flow in this regime .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the spin hall conductance ( appearing since a voltage drop can generate a transverse spin current in the presence of so interaction ) diverges in clean systems whenever two so - split energy levels become accidentally degenerate .",
    "the same behavior has been predicted in other observables such as the spin polarization appearing as a response to an external electric field.@xcite experimentally , this resonant behavior has still not been measured due to difficulties in discriminating the origin of the spin accumulation@xcite ( thus the type of so interaction ) and to the lack of experimental probes that couple to the spin current . to make matters worse from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the spin hall current used in the former works@xcite does not satisfy a continuity equation@xcite ( which clearly makes the concept of spin accumulation at the sample edges problematic ) and we have to include the so - called spin torque contribution as a source term to preserve the spin density .",
    "this is a normal consequence of the presence of so interaction , since the spin is not a good quantum number .",
    "however , the spin current defined in this way ( and therefore the spin hall conductance ) is not uniquely determined since we can add to it any current , at the price of a modification in the spin torque term , still verifying the conservation laws . to avoid any ambiguity , it is therefore conceptually more natural to define a so - polarized current along the spin precession axis , an approach that will be presented in this work .      in this paper",
    "we develop an analytical theory of electronic transport for disordered quantum hall systems in the hydrodynamic ( local equilibrium ) regime taking into account both rashba and zeeman interactions . since this work uses original techniques based on phase space quantization@xcite ,",
    "we give beforehand a brief description of our main results .",
    "first , in sec . [ sec_equation_of_motion ] ,",
    "we present the so vortex green s function formalism .",
    "we show that the single - particle green s function can be found using a systematic expansion in powers of the magnetic length . in sec .",
    "[ sec_electron_density ] , we derive a general quantum - mechanical expression for the local spin - resolved electron density valid at high magnetic fields , which takes the form of a functional of an ( arbitrary ) potential energy .",
    "we provide in sec .",
    "[ sec_electron_current ] a detailed derivation of the local electron current density , discuss both the density - gradient ( edge ) and drift ( bulk ) contributions , and explain their spatial dispersion in the presence of disorder and / or confinement potentials ( i.e. , quantum wires under high magnetic fields ) .",
    "furthermore , in sec . [ subsec_nonequilibrium ] we consider the nonequilibrium current density in the linear response regime to compute an explicit formula for the local conductivity tensor in the presence of rashba so and zeeman interactions .",
    "we prove that the hall ( off - diagonal ) component of the tensor presents preserved quantized plateaus with average value given by integer units of the conductance quantum , @xmath2 , that are robust to finite rashba coupling .",
    "our general formula is also used to obtain the local hall conductivity in a disordered topological insulator film ( in the limit of vanishing coupling between top and bottom surfaces ) at high fields , explicitly proving from a microscopic derivation its half - integer quantization .",
    "we also point out how to define a local spin hall conductivity that has a physical meaning in the presence of so interaction .",
    "this observable is shown to give a dissipationless angular momentum flow presenting fingerprints of the particle spin imbalance below the chemical potential .",
    "we shall finally present in this section the derivation of the macroscopic transport coefficients in a high - temperature regime , and demonstrate that the longitudinal conductance is characterized by a classical percolation exponent , which remains unaffected by the presence of rashba so coupling .",
    "a general conclusion describing future directions of this work closes the paper , together with some calculation details given in the appendix .",
    "we now proceed to the theoretical analysis for arbitrary smooth disorder potentials , which allows great simplifications at high magnetic fields .",
    "the so vortex states , on which our quantum high magnetic field theory relies , are eigenstates of the clean hamiltonian @xmath3 which describes a single electron of charge @xmath4 , effective mass @xmath5 , and spin @xmath6 confined in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane , under a uniform perpendicular magnetic field @xmath7 and in the presence of both rashba so and zeeman interactions . the first term in eq .",

    "the next term is the so - called rashba hamiltonian@xcite describing the coupling between orbital and spin motions @xmath16,\\ ] ] with @xmath17 a spatially constant rashba so parameter ( for simplicity , we do not consider here random spatial fluctuations of the rashba coupling field ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) the pauli matrices .",
    "finally , the last term represents the zeeman interaction between the electron s intrinsic magnetic moment and the external magnetic field @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the land @xmath21 factor@xcite and @xmath22 the bohr s magneton with @xmath23 the bare electron mass .",
    "the energy spectrum corresponding to the hamiltonian is composed by discrete so - split rashba - landau levels@xcite and reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cyclotron pulsation and @xmath26 is a dimensionless quantity defining the gap between the nonequidistant so - split energy levels in units of the cyclotron energy @xmath27 .",
    "the multiple level crossings appearing in the spectrum are controlled by the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , measuring the relative strength of the rashba so coupling [ per magnetic length , @xmath30 and zeeman interaction@xcite to the cyclotron energy .",
    "they are defined by the following expressions : @xmath31 it is clear that the energy levels in eq .",
    "are highly ( macroscopically ) degenerate since they depend on just two quantum numbers ( while three are required to fully represent the quantum states ) : a positive integer @xmath32 , called the rashba - landau level index , and @xmath33 , the so quantum number which is a function of the former and takes the values @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise . an adequate treatment of the lifting of the rashba - landau level degeneracy by a random potential energy , within the characteristic quantum hall regime at high magnetic fields , is therefore clearly needed .",
    "working in the symmetrical gauge @xmath37 , a very convenient basis of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator is the set of semiorthogonal so vortex wave functions@xcite with real - space representation @xmath38 , @xmath39 these eigenfunctions are labeled by the collection of quantum numbers @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a doubly continuous quantum number corresponding to the position in the plane of the center of the localized ( vortex - like ) spinor wave function .",

    "this function plays the role of a convolution kernel , independent of the ( arbitrary ) potential energy @xmath68 , and gives the quantum contribution to the orbital motion of the electron in the @xmath69d plane . in this sense ,",
    "eq . can be understood as the quantum formulation of the decomposition of the electronic motion into orbital and guiding center ( or vortex ) degrees of freedom , the latter being characterized by the functions @xmath70 which have still to be determined .",
    "the local so vortex green s function @xmath70 can be found to obey the following exact equation of motion@xcite @xmath71 where the retarded ( resp .",

    "the non - commutative @xmath73 product condenses the dynamics in the phase space defined by the conjugated vortex variables @xmath75 , which for 2d electrons under a perpendicular magnetic field corresponds to the physical space for the components of the guiding center position @xmath76 . in this case",
    ", the squared magnetic length @xmath77 plays the role of a deformation parameter that allows one to smoothly recover ( semi)classical dominant terms for the guiding center dynamics from the continuous limit @xmath1 . in the local equilibrium regime , the potential operator @xmath60 will contain two different types of terms : first , an effective electrostatic contribution @xmath78 resulting from random impurity potentials , confinement and/or electron - electron repulsion taken into account at the mean - field level ; and second , an external contribution proportional to a spatially varying electrochemical potential @xmath79 applied to the sample : @xmath80 the electrochemical potential ( containing both contributions from the macroscopic electric field and the macroscopic chemical potential gradients ) can be related to a macroscopic electromotive field @xmath81 that induces in the system a nonequilibrium response as a consequence of a macroscopic voltage drop .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath82 appearing in dyson equation play the role of an effective potential energy seen by the vortex and can be evaluated exactly in the so vortex representation@xcite @xmath83 with the reduced matrix elements @xmath84 dependent on the spin projection given by @xmath85 these reduced matrix elements , expressed as a convolution of the bare potential energy @xmath86 with the electronic kernel encoding the information about the cyclotron motion , can obviously be physically interpreted as an average of the bare electrostatic potential @xmath86 over the ( integrated out ) fast orbital angular degree of freedom .      finding an analytical exact solution of dyson equation for an arbitrary @xmath69d potential @xmath68 and all possible values of the external magnetic field is unquestionably an overwhelming task . however , in this work we are only interested in the high magnetic field regime where the magnetic length @xmath0 becomes the smallest length scale ( with respect to the characteristic length scale related to the local variations of the smooth potential energy ) .",
    "this suggests that one possible strategy to follow@xcite in order to obtain a solution to the equation of motion in the presence of arbitrary smooth disorder potentials and macroscopic nonequilibrium electromotive fields is to expand the matrix elements of the potential given in eq . in a power series in ( the small parameter ) @xmath0 , @xmath87 with @xmath88 independent of @xmath0 , and to find the so vortex green s functions by writing them analogously , @xmath89 here , and subsequently , we drop the retarded and advanced superscripts , since the corresponding so vortex green s functions can be easily identified from the sign of their imaginary parts . the functions @xmath90 appearing in the series expansion of the so vortex green s function",
    "can then be computed solving iteratively the equation of motion order by order in powers of the magnetic length .",
    "this procedure allows us in turn to systematically obtain quantum microscopic expressions ( at finite @xmath0 ) for any local observable in the hydrodynamic regime , under the form of functionals of the arbitrary potential energy @xmath86 .    before providing the resulting expressions for the so vortex green functions , a few comments are in order",
    "it is important to note that the green s function decomposition of the electronic motion into a slow guiding center drift and a fast cyclotron motion reveals that the full dependence on the magnetic length of the electronic green s function has two distinct origins related to each of the coupled motions .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion discussed here only affects the vortex contribution to the electronic green s function , so that the computed formulas preserve through the structure factors some quantum - mechanical features such as wave function spreading and interference effects associated with the quantized cyclotron motion .",
    "further expansion in @xmath0 of these electronic kernels allows one to recover entirely semiclassical expressions for the observables , where only the quantization of the kinetic energy is kept intact while the full internal spatial structure resulting from quantum interferences is neglected .",
    "this distinction in the @xmath0 contributions is , however , rather subtle , since one has in principle the freedom to modify the @xmath73 product with a trivial rotation in the vortex phase space .",
    "for instance , one can make integrations by parts in eq .",
    ", so that the differential operator @xmath91 appearing in expression is then included into a new guiding center contribution , which will obey a dyson equation analogous to eq . with a new infinite - order differential operator product .",
    "in this case , the structure factor for the orbital motion is simply given by the product @xmath92 of two ( localized ) vortex wave functions .",
    "clearly , this phase space rotation corresponds to an infinite - order resummation of a whole class of @xmath0-dependent terms .",
    "it has been proved in previous works@xcite that the structure factor for the orbital motion is preferentially selected as early as the landau level degeneracy is lifted , essentially due to the specific structure of the @xmath73 product operator .",
    "quite remarkably , the @xmath73 product indeed generates@xcite within the guiding center dynamics a hierarchy of local characteristic energy scales built from the spatial derivatives of the effective potentials and corresponding to intrinsic invariants , such as the local gaussian curvature . for an arbitrary 2d potential @xmath93",
    "this means that at leading order one can safely replace the @xmath73 product with the usual product between functions , as long as the thermal energy scale exceeds the curvature energy scale .",
    "this leads to a considerable simplification since the system of partial differential equations obeyed by the so vortex green s functions then transforms into a system of algebraic equations . from the physical point of view",
    ", the existence of a hierarchy of energy scales expresses a stability property ( or robustness ) of the chosen representation of quantum states .",
    "because the @xmath73 product involves products of derivatives of the vortex coordinates acting along orthogonal directions , it is obvious that this formalism becomes exact for any 1d potential .",
    "this pinpoints the quantum - mechanical effects encapsulated within the structure factor , namely , the dragging of the nodal pattern related to the quantized orbital motion along the guiding center trajectory .",
    "in other terms , the operator @xmath91 in eq . realizes the 1d delocalization of the vortex states , which are originally localized in any direction .",
    "our quantum theory somehow corresponds to a generalization of the quantum drift state picture pioneered by trugman@xcite thirty years ago .",
    "we now come back to the derivation of the so vortex green s functions .",
    "the equation of motion satisfied by the leading - order component of the so vortex green s function can be trivially found setting @xmath94 in eqs . and .",
    "at this order , we can easily see that the matrix elements of the potential are diagonal both in the rashba - landau level index and the so quantum number @xmath95 and dyson equation takes a closed form .",
    "the so vortex green s functions present then a well - known simple pole structure @xmath96 where the energies read @xmath97 .",
    "we see that the main effect of the potential energy is to locally lift the macroscopic degeneracy of the rashba - landau energy levels with respect to the guiding center coordinates @xmath76 , while keeping @xmath54 and @xmath55 as good quantum numbers .",
    "it is anticipated that the leading - order so vortex green s functions do not contribute to drift transport , since the latter is related to the gradient of the potential energy .",
    "in other terms , the drift motion necessarily involves , up to some extent , rashba - landau level mixing processes which are subdominant at high magnetic fields , so that we have to carry on our analysis by including@xcite the first @xmath0 corrections to the so vortex green s functions .",
    "the subleading term [ linear in @xmath0 within expansion ] is obtained from the algebraic equation @xmath98 g^{(1)}_{n_1,\\lambda_{1};n_2,\\lambda_{2}}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega ) = \\\\ \\sum_{n_3,\\lambda_{3 } } v^{(1)}_{n_1,\\lambda_{1};n_3,\\lambda_{3}}(\\mathbf{r } ) g^{(0)}_{n_3,\\lambda_{3};n_2,\\lambda_{2}}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] whose solution reads @xmath99[\\omega -\\xi_{n_2,\\lambda_2}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\pm i0^+]}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the first - order contribution to the so vortex green s function therefore presents a familiar structure with two poles .",
    "the subdominant potential matrix elements are given by @xmath100,\\hspace{0.5cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 and the notation @xmath102 means exchanging indices and taking the complex conjugation in the former expression . as a difference to the dominant contribution , these subleading terms in the potential expansion induce a mixing between adjacent rashba - landau levels @xmath54 and different values of the so quantum number @xmath55 in the presence of a nonzero gradient of the smooth arbitrary potential .",
    "we would like to point out that the former recursive procedure can be done in principle up to any order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "however , higher order contributions in @xmath0 only lead to weak quantitative corrections for potentials which are smooth at the scale of the cyclotron radius , so they will be disregarded in the rest of this paper .",
    "as a first simple step , we shall consider the local electron density .",
    "the local spectral density at equilibrium can be computed from the lesser component of the electronic green s function evaluated at coinciding electron positions @xmath103 , @xmath104 and can be written as a sum of two spin - resolved components ( in the @xmath105 direction perpendicular to the @xmath69d plane ) @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",

    "we would like to stress again that eq .",
    "is far more general than any semiclassical expression that can be derived in the strict limit @xmath122 , since it still accounts for wave function broadening and electron delocalization encapsulated in the electronic kernels convoluted with the thermal vortex spectral density .",
    "more precisely , this quantum expression is expected to be accurate in a very wide regime of temperatures , as long as the thermal energy scale @xmath123 overtakes the ( quite small ) local curvature characteristic energy scale .",
    "@xcite from this expression it is not difficult to be convinced that the two spin - projected densities will contribute to the spatial dependence of the full electron density with unequal weights , as a result of the so rashba interaction .",
    "this effect , notifying us that the spin is no longer a good quantum number , can be traced back to the particular entangled structure of the so vortex wave functions whose two spatial components mix adjacent energy level indices @xmath54 , each one corresponding to different spin - polarized landau levels .      at high enough temperatures such that @xmath124 , we can make the replacement @xmath125 inside the ( smooth ) functionals of the potential energy and integrate the vortex dependence taking into account the normalization condition of the electronic kernels @xmath126 .",

    ", we would like to mention that our finding for the ( preserved ) classical percolation transport exponent in the presence of so interaction is fully consistent with previous studies focused on the critical behavior in the quantum hall regime@xcite .",
    "a change of the universality class is principally expected@xcite for the quantum percolation problem ( at zero temperature ) when considering so scattering with short - range correlations which severely spoil coherence of the tunneling events , thus altering the critical percolation exponent .",
    "in contrast , smooth forms of disorder@xcite are not expected to lead to drastic modifications of the percolation transition in the presence of so interaction .",
    "in summary , we have presented in this paper a derivation of the local particle and current densities for a 2deg in the quantum hall regime by taking into account the combined presence of a smooth disorder , rashba so interaction and zeeman coupling . to that purpose ,",
    "we have used a systematic gradient expansion controlled by powers of the magnetic length that allows us to obtain quantum functionals in the local equilibrium or hydrodynamic regime . in a first stage , we have presented the calculation of the leading - order quantum and semiclassical expressions for the electron density and spin polarization .",
    "these analytical expressions , accurate for a wide range of temperatures , can be used as a starting point to numerically investigate the effect of electron - electron repulsion at the mean - field level .",
    "in addition , both observables reveal clear signatures of the presence of rashba so interaction which could be experimentally studied using local probes .",
    "we have also derived within this formalism a general functional expression for the local current density that contains both landau level mixing processes and quantum effects due to 1d wavefunction delocalization .",
    "this local current density exhibits two types of dominant contributions , so - called density - gradient and drift currents , whose spatial distribution reflects the peculiar form of the quantized energy spectrum . as an important result ,",
    "we have shown , at the semiclassical level , that the microscopic conductivity tensor is quasilocal and the hall conductivity is quantized in precise integral multiples of the conductance quantum .",
    "the value of the hall plateaus is thus robust to rashba so interaction whenever it is finite , its effect being only to change their width .",
    "remarkably , this result also applies to the macroscopic hall conductance whose quantization remains unaffected , with the longitudinal conductance universal scaling exponent equal to that of the 2deg without so coupling . in the formal ( singular ) limit of infinite rashba coupling , which physically describes a decoupled topological insulator surface ( i.e. , a single dirac cone ) in the presence of smooth disorder , we also prove that the general nontrivial expression for the local hall component is half - integer quantized due to the nature of the level @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we have shown that the conserved so - resolved electron current allows us to define a physically meaningful spin hall conductivity as the difference between the two projections of the so - resolved components .",
    "this spin hall conductivity does not present any resonances but small jumps related to the spin imbalance below the chemical potential .",
    "future interesting directions of research would be to investigate interaction effects on the basis of our quantum functionals for the local charge and current densities , and to extend the theory for macroscopic transport coefficients towards lower temperatures by keeping track of wave function spreading effects .",
    "_ note added_. recently , we became aware of some very recent theoretical work ( ref . )",
    "studying the quantization of the hall conductivity in a model of a topological insulator surface in the presence of an additional schrdinger quadratic momentum dispersion .",
    "although we consider exactly the same hamiltonian as in ref . and agree on the quantized values of the hall conductivity in the two limiting cases ( pure quadratic dispersion or pure linear momentum dispersion ) , our conclusions in the presence of both contributions are strikingly different : ref .",
    "gets deviations to the half - integral or integral quantizations depending on the finite ratio of the schrdinger to the dirac magnetic energy scales ( i.e. , on the parameter @xmath28 within our notation ) , while we find in our work that the hall conductivity remains exactly quantized in integral units of @xmath2 . in other terms",
    ", we get the result that the quantization of the hall conductivity is purely dictated by the topology of the fermi surface .",
    "these different results seem to be rooted in the different formulations of transport : ref .",
    "makes use of a _ perturbatively based _ transport theory ( whose validity is questioned at high magnetic fields for a disorder with any finite correlation length ) , while we have derived the hall conductivity from a _ nonperturbative _ semiclassical transport theory in a smooth electrostatic potential .",
