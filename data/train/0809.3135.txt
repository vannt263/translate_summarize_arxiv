    "the analysis of rotation curves provides the most reliable means for ascertaining at least the gross distribution of gravitating matter within spiral galaxies , as alar toomre pointed out @xcite . in",
    "the same paper toomre formulated a complete mathematical model of an axisymmetric and infinitely thin disk rotating under its own gravity .",
    "the model offers a tool for determining the equilibrium mass distribution directly from the rotation law of a highly flattened system , such as a spiral galaxy .",
    "it is assumed in the framework of the model , that orbits of stars , gas , etc .",
    ", are circular , and that gravitational forces are balanced solely by centrifugal forces ; the effect of pressure is thus ignored . a few years earlier , following the work reported by @xcite , brandt discussed less general situation of a very flattened system regarded as an assembly of osculating homoeoids compressed to a circular disk @xcite .",
    "all these papers followed many other pioneering ones referred to in @xcite .",
    "the customary parametric few - component models relate the mass distribution of baryonic matter mainly to luminosity measurements .",
    "the obtained amount of luminous mass is usually insufficient to account for the observed rotation of galaxies and a massive spherical dark halo is introduced as a remedy for the missing mass .",
    "the thin disk model with the surface mass density reconstructed mainly from rotation curves performs very well with strongly non - monotonic rotation curves , whereas the customary models have difficulties in explaining them .",
    "the thin disk model can easily account for high local gradients of rotational velocity , typically giving a lower total mass . in an extreme example",
    ", the rotational velocity of an outer galactic region , falling off faster than keplerian , can not be explained by the presence of a massive spherically symmetric halo .",
    "however , such a feature may be explained using a flattened mass distribution with a suitably changing mass profile .",
    "the major difficulty in the practical use of the disk model lies with unambiguous mass density reconstruction . unlike for spherical symmetry",
    ", the density depends on the assumed extrapolation of the rotation curve beyond the last measurement point ( referred to in this paper as the cutoff radius ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the nonlocal relation between the surface density and the rotational velocity of a disk - like system . for a reliable reconstruction of the disk surface density",
    ", the rotation curve has to be known globally ( which , for observational reasons , is impossible ) or at least out to its keplerian falloff .",
    "therefore , the velocity measurements must be supplemented with independent data in order to constrain the sought mass distribution .",
    "this may be achieved , for example , by taking into account the amount of hydrogen measured in the outermost galactic regions as was done in @xcite .",
    "mass estimates of spiral galaxies are strongly model - dependent .",
    "rotational velocities , when interpreted in a spherical dark halo model , may greatly overestimate galactic masses as compared to the disk model .",
    "it is thus important to consider a phenomenologically acceptable model that gives a lower limit to the mass .",
    "the thin disk model may serve as such a reference model .",
    "ngc 4736 is an example of a spiral galaxy with a rotation curve of which outer parts can not be satisfactorily reconstructed when a spherical halo is assumed . by a simple examination one finds that in the circular orbit approximation , the rotation curve of this galaxy can not be created by a spherical matter distribution .",
    "by applying the thin disk model , with no constraining assumptions about the mass - to - light ratio profile , one can find a mass profile in this galaxy that perfectly conforms with its rotation curve , and agrees with the amount of hydrogen observed at large radii , beyond the cutoff radius @xcite . only insignificant ( if any ) amount of dark matter is required , whereas the customary models predict the galaxy to be dark matter dominated .",
    "in this paper we report also on another spiral galaxy , ngc 5457 , in which the amount of baryonic matter found in the disk model accounts for this galaxy rotation .",
    "the main objection against the use of the axisymmetric thin disk as a model of a spiral galaxy , is its instability with too short time scale @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to stabilize such a system is to add a sufficiently strong spherically symmetric potential .",
    "this is usually done by introducing a massive spherical halo of dark matter , which is believed to surround spiral galaxies .",
    "however , it should be noted that the galactic interior , irrespectively of its structure , produces at radii sufficiently large almost spherically symmetric potential that may stabilize the external circular orbits .",
    "putting the stability issue aside , the disk model is still useful for approximate description of the gravitational field of a flattened galaxy .",
    "suppose that the rotation curve of such a galaxy represents the velocity of the streaming motion of matter rotating on roughly circular orbits in the galactic disk .",
    "the disk model associates with this rotation curve a formal surface mass density that may be considered as an approximation of the column density of matter in this galaxy . to ensure its applicability",
    ", we use the model only for describing galaxies with rotation curves breaking the condition of spherical mass distribution at large distances from their centers .",
    "we assume that this non - sphericity can be attributed to flattening of these galaxies . in these regions",
    "we therefore expect the disk model to better reflect the oblateness of such galaxies than the models with massive spherical halo .",
    "what s more , the customary rotation curve modeling already assumes a resultant thin disk surface density as a superposition of the stellar disk component s surface density and of the column density of the spherical bulge component projected onto the thin disk s plane .",
    "based on these premises the use of the single global thin disk for modeling the whole mass distribution in a flattened galaxy seems justified .",
    "the only new qualitative thing is that the effective disk becomes extended further out to the outer part in the case when the sphericity condition is broken there , that is , when the massive spherical halo can not be introduced .",
    "the velocity of test bodies moving on circular orbits in the equatorial plane of a spherically symmetric mass distribution with a mass function @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 .",
    "by analogy with this relation we define the keplerian mass function @xmath2 of a galaxy with a rotation curve @xmath3 . for a galaxy with a massive spherical cdm halo , the keplerian mass function , at least for large radii , should agree with the true mass function of the galaxy .",
    "keplerian mass functions of some spiral galaxies decline or are non - monotonic in their outer parts , suggesting the presence of an extended , flattened and massive subsystem in these galaxies rather than a spherical one .",
    "the spherical dark halo may be excluded in favor of a large flattened subsystem if the sphericity condition  @xmath4  is broken at larger radii ( beyond the central bulge ) . in this case",
    "the global disk model seems more appropriate for reconstruction of the mass distribution .",
    "note , that the central spherical bulge may be represented by a column mass density in the disk plane since the details of the internal mass distribution are not very important for the determination of the gravitational field in the distant regions , thus the use of the disk model in the central regions is also acceptable .",
    "since there are many examples of disk - like mass configurations with their rotation laws satisfying the sphericity condition ( [ eq : sph_cond ] ) , violation of the condition at larger radii provides a strong argument for the presence of an extended flattened component and against a significant spherical halo .",
    "for example , the toomre thin disk of unit mass with the surface mass density @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is a dimensionless radius in cylindrical coordinates ) , rotates differentially with velocity @xmath7 @xcite , hence @xmath8 .",
    "as so , a spherically symmetric mass distribution is possible with the same rotation curve . in the approximation of circular orbits ,",
    "the sphericity condition is thus necessary , although not sufficient , for the presence of an extended and dominating spherical halo .",
    "figure [ fig : test ] shows two rotation curves that break inequality ( [ eq : sph_cond ] ) at large radii .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in combination with the observed local brightness @xmath9 , the determined surface density @xmath10 yields the corresponding local mass - to - light ratio profile @xmath11 . in the @xmath12 band , @xmath11 increases near the disk edge , c.f . figure [ fig : m101 ] .",
    "a similar increase was observed by sofue for several other galaxies @xcite .",
    "this rise would seem at first as the signature of the presence of dark matter in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , if stars were to comprise the whole baryonic mass of the galaxy , the @xmath11 ratio would be always that of stars , even in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "this is not the case for ngc 5457 , however .",
    "the increase of the local mass - to - light ratio in this galaxy is caused by the presence of large amounts of hydrogen beyond the stellar disk . if there is some gas , eg .",
    "hydrogen and helium , then the local mass  to  light ratio profile @xmath14 diverges as @xmath15 .",
    "but the gas contribution should be subtracted as it is nonluminous in the visible and infrared bands . as is seen in figure [ fig : m101 ] , after subtraction of the hydrogen and primordial helium contribution , the local mass  to ",
    "light ratio profile stops to increase at the disk edge .",
    "also in the @xmath16 band the ratio has decreased .",
    "this fact , together with the low mass  to  light ratio in the @xmath17 band , shows that the @xmath18 halo is not needed to account for this galaxy s rotation .",
    "furthermore , the fact of breaking the sphericity condition , practically excludes a massive and spherical halo of cdm in ngc 5457 .",
    "for the accuracy of determination of the mass distribution and its features in the disk component , local non - monotonic properties of rotation curves are important .",
    "they are not less important than the value of the rotational velocity .",
    "in particular , a local increase in the velocity field may be caused simply by a local decrease of matter density in the disk component and not by the increase of density in the spherical component of a galaxy .",
    "the important information about mass distribution carried by rotation curves may be simply overlooked if one assumes that the local mass distribution is proportional to the local brightness . in some cases the dark matter halo",
    "is introduced simply because the amount of luminous matter with the constant mass - to - light ratio found by the least square fitting method , can not account for the rotation at large radii .",
    "the example of the spiral galaxy ngc 4736 discussed in @xcite very well illustrates this observation .",
    "this shows also that determination of mass distribution in spiral galaxies is model dependent . for more reliable predictions",
    "it is thus important to have a generic model , more flexible and general than the parametric models with smooth profiles and constant mass - to - light ratios .",
    "it seems that the global thin disk model provides such a generic model , at least for flattened galaxies with rotation curves breaking at large radii the sphericity condition .",
    "due to observational cutoff in rotation data , the surface mass density reconstruction in the galactic disk ( and consequently in the whole galaxy ) , is subject to high uncertainties , which increase with the distance from the center . only in particular situations of rotation curves with almost keplerian tails , the cutoff errors can be eliminated and taken into account . the observationally determined part of a given rotation curve may be explained by various internal disk mass distributions depending on how the rotation law has been extrapolated beyond the cutoff radius . this uncertainty can be removed if additional constraints on the mass distribution in the outer parts , not covered with rotation measurements , are taken into account . in this respect",
    "the hydrogen distribution in the outer regions can be used .",
    "we have established for galaxies ngc4736 and ngc5457 that the observed amount of baryonic matter accounts for rotation of these galaxies in the approximation of the global disk model .",
