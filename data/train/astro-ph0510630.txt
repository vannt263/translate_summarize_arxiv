    "much of the radiation from supernova remnants is expected to be emitted in the infrared range , from heated grains and nebular emission lines .",
    "however , supernova remnants have generally proven to be difficult to detect in the infrared , especially in the galactic plane where regions are far brighter .",
    "two attempted infrared supernova remnant surveys used iras observations at 12100 @xmath0 m and found possible emission from 12 and 14 remnants @xcite , respectively , with only 7 in common between the two surveys , from the sample of 95 remnants in the portion of the galactic plane covered in the new survey presented in this paper .",
    "we present in this paper a new infrared survey of supernova remnants using the infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite on the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite . in the galactic legacy",
    "infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) @xcite , the four irac arrays  with filters centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 m and pixels of @xmath9 size  were used to map the inner galaxy within galactic longitudes @xmath1 and latitudes @xmath2 .",
    "glimpse is a significant advance both because of the large increase in angular resolution and sensitivity as well as covering a new set of infrared wavelengths .",
    "there are  supernova remnants remnants within glimpse as per the @xcite catalog .",
    "the 5-@xmath10 sensitivity of glimpse for point sources is 14.0 , 12.0 , 10.5 and 9.0 mag at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the raw ( 1-@xmath10 ) surface brightness sensitivity is 0.3 , 0.3 , 0.7 , and 0.6 mjy  sr@xmath11 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 m , respectively . at 5.8 and 8 @xmath0 m ,",
    "most of the galactic plane is filled with diffuse emission , and at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m point - source confusion is significant over much of the galactic plane .",
    "thus the primary limitation of this supernova remnant survey is not instrumental noise but rather confusion from other , overlapping astronomical sources .",
    "to provide a basis for comparison and possible classification of the infrared colors , we consider here the emission mechanisms expected to dominate the mid - infrared . figure",
    "[ h2modsconcept ] summarizes the predictions in a color - color diagram .    shocked gas cools through emission lines , and many important emission lines occur in the mid - infrared .",
    "the dominant coolant for shocked molecular gas , over a wide range of densities , is h@xmath12 line emission . fast shocks into moderately dense gas ( e.g. 100 km  s@xmath11 shocks into gas with density @xmath13 @xmath14 ) , cool via atomic fine - structure lines , for which we used a periodic table for fine structure lines to determine which should be the brightest @xcite",

    "for the mature supernova remnant 3c  391 with shocks into moderately dense ( @xmath16 @xmath14 ) gas , the 5 - 15 @xmath0 m spectrum showed very bright and , in addition to h@xmath12 lines @xcite .",
    "for the very young supernova remnant cas a , which is dominated by ejecta and freshly - formed dust , the 6 - 16 @xmath0 m spectrum showed very bright and @xcite .",
    "for the supernova remnant rcw  103 , a wide range of lines was detected over the wavelengths relevant to irac : h@xmath12 lines in all channels , br@xmath15 in channel 2 , in channel 3 , and in channel 4 @xcite .    except for the youngest ( @xmath17 yr ) , supernova remnants are dominated by swept - up interstellar matter , for which infrared emission from dust is inevitable , but the amount and color are not straightforward to predict . mid - infrared emission from the interstellar medium",
    "is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) bands , especially in the irac 5.8 and 8 @xmath0 m channels .",
    "figure  [ filters ] shows the spectrum of the reflection nebula ngc 7023 , illustrating how typical interstellar dust may contribute to the irac wavebands .",
    "grains are sputtered and vaporized in very strong shocks @xcite , which will reduce the infrared emission per unit mass .",
    "more importantly , in attempting to relate infrared features to the supernova remnants , grains are shattered in strong shocks @xcite .",
    "a size distribution with enhanced smaller grains will have a higher color temperature , because the smaller grains are out of thermal equilibrium and emit over a wide range of higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "the smallest grains , or macromolecular pah may be destroyed or altered in even slower shocks and are largely absent in dense , shocked clumps @xcite .",
    "thus it is nearly impossible to predict the colors of supernova remnants at irac wavelengths : the processes are too complicated ( and in competition with each other ) , and the shocks span too wide a range of properties for there to be a typical color .",
    "diffuse interstellar clouds have a wide range of 12/100 @xmath0 m ratios  possibly due to shock processing by prior supernova blast waves .",
    "given this range of possible initial conditions of the grains , it is even more unlikely that the processed grains will have predictable properties .",
    "that being said , observations of infrared emission from snrs to date have shown little or no evidence of significant dust emission ( pah or continuum ) within the wavelengths of the irac bands .",
    "we expect shocked dust to contribute more in the longest - wavelength irac channel than the others , whether the emission is from macromolecular pah or from small grains .",
    "synchrotron emission can contribute to all wavelengths from the radio to x - ray , and has been detected in the near - infrared from cas  a @xcite .",
    "the color of pure synchrotron emission in the irac bands would be approximately 0.6;0.7;0.8;1 .",
    "none of the supernova remnants we detected have this color .",
    "the one with colors closest to pure synchrotron is for a line of sight for which the mid - infrared spectrum was measured with _",
    "iso _ and was dominated by molecular line emission with negligible continuum @xcite .",
    "since many of the snr in our sample are very bright in the radio , we expect them to all have at least faint synchrotron radiation .",
    "the expected effect of this synchrotron radiation on the mid - infrared colors is to ` fill in ' the channels that do not have significant line or dust emission .",
    "simple models are presented below for the mid - infrared colors expected from the three main snr emission mechanisms described above .",
    "a summary of the derived color / emission mechanism templates is presented in figure  [ h2modsconcept ] .",
    "we now develop simple models to generate template colors for the three main emission mechanisms .    _",
    "ism_first , for the reflection nebula ngc  7023 , the colors in the irac channels 1;2;3;4 are 0.054;0.061;0.40;1 . for the region",

    "the origin of these colors is a combination of pah and nebular line emission , probably with a large pah contribution based on the similarity to ngc  7023 .",
    "the region and reflection nebula colors are very similar and will be difficult to distinguish , but for our purpose of classifying unprocessed interstellar medium this is not important .",
    "figure  [ h2modsconcept ] shows the colors of ngc  7023 and outlines a region of color - color space that could be attributed to sources with similar spectra .",
    "_ shocked molecules_the colors of a source dominated by molecular emission lines can be estimated using a three - temperature - component h@xmath12 excitation model that matches many lines over a wide range of energy levels for ic  443 @xcite .",
    "the irac colors of a shocked h@xmath12 clump are expected to be 0.42;0.52;0.90;1 .",
    "note the significantly enhanced emission in channels 1 and 2 .",
    "furthermore , there is a co fundamental band that falls within channel 2 , with total emission comparable to that of h@xmath12 in herbig - haro shocks with similar densities and shock velocities .",

    "therefore , we measure the irac color from two positions of the snr . a slice through the filament near 16;17;32.8;-51;06;28 yields colors 0.14;0.28;0.86;1 ( with 8 @xmath0 m brightness 14.5 mjy  sr@xmath11 ) , most likely dominated by shocked molecules ( but with some ionic contribution in channel 3 ) .",
    "much of the southern rim has such colors . a thin filament near 16;17;45.7;-51;04;58 ( table  [ detected ] ) is undetected in channel 1 despite being very distinct in channel 3 indicating ionic shocks .",

    "protrusions extend from this region in many directions , including narrow filaments and what appears to be a very large ` plume ' extending to the northwest of the region , directly across the western half of kes  32 .",
    "it is not clear which features are associated with the remnant and which are associated with the region .",
    "however , the high - resolution spitzer / irac image shows the ` plume ' connects directly to the region and is most likely associated with it .",
    "this contradicts an earlier conjecture that the plume , which can been seen in radio images , could be a jet of energetic particles from the stellar remnant of kes  32 @xcite .",
    "instead , we suspect that the plume originates from the region and is being ionized by the current generation of young stars within it .",

    "the irac colors suggest molecular shocks , consistent with their close association with the oh masers .",

    "none of the other maser spots in this remnant have associated 4.5 @xmath0 m spots , though some faint , patchy emission is in the vicinity of most of the masers associated with ctb  37a .",
    "the patch of green mid - infrared emission in the ne is almost certainly shocked h@xmath12 gas ; the colors in irac channels ( table  [ detected ] ) are similar to that expected for h@xmath12+co and not consistent with pah emission .",

    "the arc near 17;14;14.7;-38;31;13 has irac colors 0.07;0.04;0.42;1 , consistent with pah emission .",
    "since there are so many regions with similar colors , it is possible that some of these red filaments are unrelated to the remnant .",
    "we suspect , however , that many of the infrared structures within the radio remnant are in fact related to the remnant .",
    "for example , the relatively bright , semicircular region including the filament mentioned above , the bright patch and associated filaments centered around 17;14;22.6;-38;35;06 are all located at the transition between the bright radio half - shell and the fainter extended emission that appears to be the opening of the blowout , probably near the surface of the pre - explosion cloud .",

    "the correspondence between the 5.8 @xmath0 m filament detected by irac ( fig .",
    "[ ctb37acombined]b ) and the 6 cm radio rim detected with the vla ( fig .",
    "6 of kassim et al .",
    "1991 ) is precise , so the association of these features is beyond doubt .",
    "the filament is narrow  unresolved ( @xmath43 ) to irac .",
    "the filament is detected irac channels 24 , with color ratios ( table  [ detected ] ) measured toward 17;15;04.6;-38;33;40 .",
    "the 5.8/8 @xmath0 m ratio is much to high to be pah emission , and the filament is most likely dominated by emission lines from shocked gas .",
    "the radio extent of this remnant can be seen in sensitive vla images @xcite to extend across the nw part of ctb  37a and emerge from its northern rim .",
    "the second and third northernmost oh 1720 mhz masers in this region are at @xmath44 and -21 km  s@xmath11 , clearly distinct from the velocities of the other 8 masers that are associated with ctb  37a .",
    "there are also distinct molecular clouds at these velocities that are likely related to the remnants , with the -23 km  s@xmath11 cloud situated just west of g348.5 - 0.0 having the masers at its edge ; this cloud is most likely associated with g348.5 - 0.0 @xcite .",
    "the spitzer / irac images further support the idea that g348.5 - 0.0 is interacting with a dense cloud , because the infrared emission most likely traces relatively dense , shocked gas .",
    "the patch of green infrared emission in the northern part of ctb  37a is in the region where that remnant overlaps with g348.5 - 0.0 and could contain contributions from both remnants , but we associate it with ctb  37a based on the morphology ( infrared filaments follow the ctb  37a radio shape , not g348.5 - 0.0 , in this patch ) and associated maser velocities .",
    "there is no infrared emission that appears related to the two oh masers associated with g348.5 - 0.0 .",
    "the infrared filament along the radio rim of g348.5 - 0.0 is , however , clearly part of this remnant , and projecting it to the west , taking into account the curvature of the radio shell , it passes through the oh masers at -23 and -21 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this remnant and ctb  37a are a special case of two different remnants interacting with two different molecular clouds , all superposed in the same several arcmin of the sky .",
    "* g349.7 + 0.2*this is one of the brightest snrs in the survey , and owing to its great distance it is the most luminous .",
    "its x - ray brightness makes it one of the most luminous x - ray remnants and it may be younger than 3000 yr @xcite .",
    "the radio image was constructed by combining vla data in a , c , cd , and d configurations , with @xmath45 resolution @xcite .",
    "this remnant was shown to be interacting with a large molecular shell by @xcite , and oh maser emission was detected by @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared emission is detected in all irac bands ( fig .",
    "[ g349color ] ) ; it is very bright at 5.8 @xmath0 m and easily discerned at 4.5 and 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "there are 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath0 m emission peaks near 4 of the 5 oh 1720 mhz maser spots ( all except the first in @xcite ) ; these peaks are not as prominent at 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "shocked h@xmath12 line emission is a likely contributor to the 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath0 m wavebands .",
    "the 8 @xmath0 m image may contain an emission mechanism in addition to the h@xmath12s(5 ) line , such as [ ] 6.99 @xmath0 m .",
    "there is a filament of red ( mostly 8 @xmath0 m ) emission extending from the supernova remnant toward the west ; it extends beyond the boundary of figure  [ g349color ] and has colors similar to other extended emission in the field nearby .",
    "this is apparently part of the dense cloud with which the supernova remnant is interacting .",
    "the unusual morphology of the remnant , with its shell much brighter on the western side , is caused by the shock propagating into the long axis of a roughly cylindrical cloud .",
    "the colors of the detected snrs reveal a wide range of emission mechanisms .",
    "figure  [ colcol ] shows the observed colors for 1 - 2 spots per remnant together with bounding regions for molecular shocks , ionic shocks , and pah emission from figure  [ h2modsconcept ] .",
    "nine spots have colors consistent with molecular shocks ,   have colors consistent with ionic shocks , and   are consistent with pah emission from unshocked ism . of the remaining all but one",
    "are intermediate between molecular and ionic shocks and probably represent a mixture of shock types .",
    "one spot , the kes  69 ridge , falls sufficiently outside the bounds of emission mechanisms considered here that its colors can not be explained by the mechanisms discussed here .",
    "the snrs with colors suggesting molecular shocks include 3c  391 , kes  17 , g346.6 - 0.2 , g311.5 - 0.3 , g344.7 - 0.1 , kes  20 and g11.2 - 0.3 .",
    "two of these ( 3c  391 and g346.2 - 0.2 ) have associated oh 1720 mhz masers @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "only 14% of the entire sample of 95 remnants have oh 1720 mhz masers , so the association of these infrared colors with molecular shocks is not a chance coincidence .",
    "a total of 7 out of 18 irac - detected remnants have associated masers ; the 39% association rate is again clearly not by chance .",
    "the remnants with colors suggesting molecular shocks but lacking oh masers may not have the specific , narrow physical conditions required to generate the maser inversions .",
    "for example , 3c  391 has a strong interaction with a giant molecular cloud on its bright radio nw ridge , but the oh masers are only present in two spots to the edge of the main interaction @xcite .",
    "one of the remnants with irac colors in the ` molecular ' region of the color - color diagram is the historical snr g11.2 - 0.3 .",
    "as discussed above , the mid - infrared emission from this young snr may not be exclusively from molecular lines .",
    "dust continuum is also unlikely to be the source of the unusual colors , because it would make the 8 @xmath0 m band bright and move the colors to the left .",
    "synchrotron radiation could contribute an extra source of 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m emission and could possibly explain the colors .",
    "otherwise the colors could indicate unusual abundances ; further spectroscopic observations are needed to understand this snr .",
    "the snrs with colors suggesting ionic shocks are 3c  397 , w  49b , and 3c  391 ( nw ridge ) . the radio emission from all three is bright and highly structured , with bright near - infrared [ ] that correlates in detail with the radio structure .",
    "the remnants with colors suggesting a mixture of molecular and ionic shocks are rcw  103 , ctb  37a , g348.5 - 0.0 , and 3c  396 .",
    "in rcw  103 , spectroscopy clearly reveals bright lines from both molecular and ionic shocks @xcite . for ctb  37a and g348.5 - 0.0 , oh 1720",
    "mhz masers are associated suggesting likely shocked molecular gas .",
    "the presence of both types of shock in an snr is not unexpected , as the shocked dense clumps that cool via molecular lines are likely immersed in a lower - density medium that , when shocked , cools via ionic lines .",
    "this is clearly seen in the _ iso _ spectra of w  28 , 3c  391 , w  44 , ic  443 , and rcw  103 @xcite .",
    "the details of the emission mechanism for each snr remain to be determined with follow - up spectroscopy and comparison to ground - based observations .",
    "however , the irac survey already suggests a trend such that mid - infrared - detected snrs tend to have colors suggesting shocks into dense gas .",
    "while this is an obvious selection effect , because many important cooling lines of such shocks are present in the mid - infrared , the sheer number of such detections suggests that molecular cloud interactions are not uncommon : at least 6% of snrs in our survey show infrared colors suggesting molecular shocks .",
    "some of these supernova remnants suspected suspected to be interacting with molecular clouds have been studied relatively little and await further investigation .",
