    "the second and third terms constitute electron tunneling between dots @xmath14 and @xmath15 and between @xmath16 and @xmath17 with tunnel couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the last term describes the capacitive interaction between neighboring dots of opposite circuits . for the present purpose ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider only up to one spinless electron per double dot .",
    "each dot @xmath7 is coupled to a lead @xmath20 fully described by @xmath21 and @xmath22 with chemical potential @xmath23 and the fermi function @xmath24^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the dot - lead contact is established by the tunnel hamiltonian @xmath25 we assume within a wide - band limit that all coupling strengths @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    by established techniques @xcite , we derive for the reduced density operator of the dots , @xmath28 , the bloch - redfield master equation ( in units with @xmath29 ) @xmath30    -{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\text{leads } \\int_0^\\infty d\\tau     \\sum_\\ell [ v_\\ell,[\\tilde{v}_\\ell(-\\tau ) , r ] ] , \\label{bloch - redfield}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . the tilde denotes the interaction picture operator @xmath32 with @xmath33 $ ] the propagator in the absence of dot - lead tunneling .",
    "the inter - dot tunneling , however , has to be included in @xmath34 to ensure compliance with equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "this is in the present case of particular importance , because otherwise the master equation would provide a spurious current which may even be larger than the ratchet current .",
    "the central quantities of interest are the currents through the dot - lead contacts which we define as the time - derivative of the charge in the respective lead , @xmath35 .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain @xcite @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is formally obtained from @xmath39 by the replacement @xmath40 .    for the numerical solution of the master equation",
    ", we need to cope with the interaction picture representation of the tunneling operators @xmath41 . for the lead operators , we readily insert @xmath42 , while for the dot operators",
    ", we accomplish this task by decomposing both the master equation and the current operators into the eigenstates of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we have to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath44 reflects the respective electron number @xmath45 .",

    "the full expression for @xmath47 is somewhat lengthy so that we do not write it explicitly .",
    "before addressing the question how the ratchet acts back on the drive circuit , we work out the scenario in which electrons tunneling through the drive circuit entail an effective ac force on the ratchet . in doing so , we generalize the previous @xmath0 theory treatment @xcite to the case of delocalized ratchet electrons .",
    "the effective ac driving can be obtained from hamiltonian as follows .",
    "an electron on dot @xmath48 shifts the onsite energy @xmath49 by @xmath50 , while @xmath51 is shifted by @xmath50 if an electron resides on dot @xmath17 , i.e.  the ratchet detuning @xmath52 changes by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "hence the ratchet acquires the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath55 . for its treatment with fermi s golden rule",
    ", we need to compute the fourier transformed @xmath56 of the correlation function @xmath57 . for large bias voltage @xmath58 ,",
    "all levels of the drive circuit lie within the voltage window .",

    ", we obtain @xmath61 i.e.  a double lorentzian with peaks at @xmath62 . in the time domain , @xmath63 which underlines the ac character of the stochastic force @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath66 induces transitions between the one - electron eigenstates of the ratchet hamiltonian , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 and the level splitting @xmath70 . for sufficiently small @xmath50 , a golden rule calculation with",
    "the transition matrix element @xmath71 yields the rate @xmath72 .",
    "once the electron is in the excited state @xmath73 , it may tunnel to lead  1 or to lead  2 . in turn , if the ratchet double dot is in the empty state @xmath74 , an electron may tunnel from one of the leads to the ground state @xmath75 . by transforming the current operators @xmath76 into the basis @xmath77",
    ", we find that the transition rates are proportional to the overlaps @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",

    "its origin is the delocalization of the ratchet eigenstates for @xmath93 . in the present context ,",
    "this regime is the most intriguing one , because it contains both the current maximum at @xmath94 and the main current reversal at @xmath95 .",
    "the analytical result already allows an estimate for the size of the ratchet current .",
    "the lorentzian @xmath96 assumes its maximum @xmath97 if the ratchet and the drive circuit are in resonance , @xmath98 .",
    "the corresponding condition on the second factor of this expression is @xmath99 , so that the maximal ratchet current is roughly @xmath100 .",
    "interestingly enough , this value depends only on the parameters of the drive circuit and on the coupling strength , but not on the ratchet parameters .    in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the dot - lead coupling is @xmath101 , while the capacitive coupling @xmath50 is significantly smaller .",

    "two double quantum dots with similar geometry and similar tunnel couplings but with the much stronger interaction @xmath104 have already been realized @xcite , such that a considerably larger ratchet current should be achievable as well .",
    "let us now turn to the treatment of the drive circuit as a quantum system that is affected by the coupling to the ratchet .",
    "for this purpose , we compute the currents numerically by solving the master equation .",
    "figure  [ fig : i(e ) ] demonstrates that for the large drive circuit bias @xmath105 , the ratchet current agrees quite well with our prediction  . in particular , it exhibits a current reversal at @xmath95 , while the current maximum is obtained for @xmath106 , i.e.  in the coherent regime .",
    "the lack of perfect symmetry is due to the fact that on average , dot @xmath16 is slightly stronger populated than dot @xmath17 .",
    "the drive current ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : i(e ) ] ) is influenced by the interaction only close to @xmath107 . for larger @xmath108",

    "in contrast to this expectation , however , e.g.  for @xmath115 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : i(e ) ] ) , the ratchet current exhibits steps similar to those of coulomb blockade . the location of these steps is best visible in the differential transconductance @xmath116 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i(e , v)](b ) .",
    "they are based on the fact that transitions between states with different electron number require the corresponding energy difference to lie within the voltage window .",
    "thus , we can identify the states that govern the transport yielding a full quantum mechanical picture of the ratchet mechanism . by investigating the location of the steps upon variation of @xmath117 and @xmath118",
    ", we find that they relate to the transitions marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : i(e , v)](a ) .",
    "all relevant transitions involve two - electron states , since the ratchet current is interaction induced .",
    "-electron states @xmath119 of the couped double quantum dots for @xmath120 .",
    "the arrows mark the transitions that govern the ratchet current .",
    "( b ) differential transconductance @xmath121 highlighting the steps of the ratchet current as a function of the detuning and the bias at the drive circuit .",
    "all other parameters are as in fig .  [",
    "fig : i(e ) ] . ]",
    "a more profound discussion of the transport process requires knowledge about the structure of the eigenstates of hamiltonian . for @xmath112 ,",
    "they are given by the direct products of the ratchet states @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 and the according eigenstates of the drive dots , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the one - electron states read @xmath125 , where @xmath126 . obviously , the interaction does not affect the one - electron states , while any two - electron state acquires for finite @xmath50 an admixture of all other two - electron states",
    ". from standard perturbation theory follows that the admixture is of the order @xmath127 . for the small values of @xmath50 considered here ,",
    "the admixture is small as well and , thus , it is appropriate to keep the notation @xmath128 .",
    "the consequence of the interaction is that when an electron tunnels from lead  3 via the drive dots to lead  4 , the ratchet ground state gains a contribution of the excited ratchet state , i.e.  the drive current induces a transition of the type @xmath129 , where @xmath130 . since an excited ratchet electron will leave the dots predominantly towards a particular lead ( for @xmath131 to lead  2 ) , a ratchet current @xmath132 will flow .    with this general scenario in mind ,",
    "it is possible to explain how upon increasing @xmath108 , the particular tunnel events come into play . for zero bias voltage , both the ratchet and the drive circuit",
    "are at equilibrium in state @xmath133 .",
    "as soon as @xmath134 drops below the ground state energy of the drive circuit , both a drive current and a tiny ratchet current set in",
    ". a second step in the ratchet current is observed when both drive states lie within the voltage window and can be occupied .",
    "only then an electron in the drive circuit performs coherent tunnel oscillations and entail a significant ac force .",
    "the third step relates to the transition latexmath:[$|g , e\\rangle \\to    while transferring approximately the energy @xmath90 to the ratchet and thereby exciting it .",
    "energy conservation now requires that the drive electron finds in lead  4 an unoccupied state with energy @xmath136 , which is the case for @xmath137 . shortly after that , tunneling from lead  3 to the drive dot under ratchet excitation , i.e.  the transition @xmath138 is enabled as well , causing the forth current step .",
    "the latter two tunnel processes have a relatively low probability , so that their influence on the drive current is not noticeable . by contrast , their impact on the ratchet current is significant , because they immediately lead to the directed transport of an ratchet electron .",
    "since this scenario relies on the interaction - induced high - energy components of the drive circuit states , the full ratchet mechanism is active only at unexpectedly large voltages .",
    "the underlying formation of two - electron states is not included in the picture of stochastic ac driving and , thus , represents the relevant backaction .",
    "we have studied a coherent double - dot quantum ratchet similar to that of recent experiments @xcite , but with a driving stemming from tunnel oscillations in a close - by further double quantum dot .",
    "these tunnel oscillations turned out to be sufficiently strong and stable to induce ratchet currents of the order of those in related experiments .",
    "a particular feature of our model is that it includes both the ratchet and the drive circuit , which enabled us to go beyond the picture in which the drive circuit is not affected by the ratchet .",
    "this revealed that the states of the drive circuit acquire components with high energies , which represents the relevant backaction by the ratchet .",
    "the measurable consequences are unexpected steps in the ratchet current .",
    "moreover , our results imply that tunnel oscillations can be employed as on - chip sources of ac driving .",
    "thus we are confident that our results will stimulate further experimental theoretical effort in this direction ."
