    "it has been shown by pelez  @xcite that the complex poles corresponding to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons move toward the real axis on the second riemann sheet as a number of colors , @xmath3 , becomes large , and that in contrast to the vector mesons those corresponding to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states move away from the real axis , within the inverse amplitude method  ( iam ) using full @xmath6 amplitudes of the chiral perturbation theory  ( chpt)@xcite",
    ".    stimulated by this work , we have calculated how physical quantities such as phase shifts and cross sections behave on the real axis of the physical sheet as @xmath0 increases from 3 to some finite values@xcite . in this calculation",
    "we adopt an approximate version of the two - channel iam developed by oller - oset - pelez  ( oop)@xcite , which we call the oop version .",
    "we have obtained the result that while the vector mesons become narrower resonances , the light scalar meson nonet including the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states fade out as @xmath0 exceeds about 6 .",
    "this result has been confirmed by pelez in his new paper , excluding an exceptional case of the @xmath8 state@xcite .",
    "the same issue have been discussed by oller and oset@xcite using a different model , in which chiral @xmath9 amplitudes and possible preexisting tree resonance poles are introduced as ingredients of the model .",
    "their criterion whether a meson is dynamical or not is that the partial wave amplitude of the model can reproduce the experimental data without a nearby preexisting pole .",
    "the preexisting poles are assumed to survive in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "they have concluded that while the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons need each preexisting pole , light scalar mesons , possibly except for the @xmath7 state , do not necessarily need such poles .",
    "we note , however , that if energies to be fitted by the model are restricted to 1.2 gev , the preexisting pole is not needed for the @xmath10 state@xcite .",
    "thus , the above observations are consistent with the common understanding that the members of the vector meson nonet including @xmath1 and @xmath2 are typical of @xmath11 mesons in large @xmath0 qcd@xcite . on the other hand",
    "the behavior of scalar mesons is at variance with the nature of the @xmath11 mesons .    in this paper",
    "we study again the behavior of two - meson scattering amplitudes when @xmath0 increases from 3 under some different conditions from previous work , within the two - channel oop version with @xmath6 amplitudes given in ref .",
    "the @xmath6 amplitudes depend on values of the low energy constants  ( lec ) of chpt , denoted as @xmath12 , which are to be determined phenomenologically so as to reproduce experimental data .",
    "it would be difficult , therefore , to discriminate the nature of resonances by studying the @xmath13 world alone . in order to know the nature of the low mass mesons",
    ", it will be very useful to study how light vector and scalar meson states behave and how complex poles of @xmath7 and @xmath8 move when we increase @xmath0 from 3 to some values .",
    "although we do not go far away from the real @xmath13 world with @xmath14 chiral symmetry , we observe that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson survive as narrow width resonances , but the light scalar nonet fade out as @xmath0 exceeds a rather small number about 6 .",
    "this is the same result as in the previous work@xcite .    in the next section",
    "the explicit @xmath0 dependence of the oop amplitudes is given , the vector channel and scalar channel are discussed in section 2 and 3 , and the conclusions and discussion is given in the last section .",
    "in order to carry out the study we have to find the explicit @xmath0 dependence of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes in chpt have an explicit @xmath0 dependence through the pion decay constant and the lecs .",
    "since the pion decay constant @xmath15 is of @xmath16 and the lecs , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are to be of @xmath22 , but @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are of @xmath27,@xcite we put l_n(n_c)&= & + l_n , + f_^2(n_c)&= & , where @xmath28 satisfy the relations , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath31 with @xmath32 mev .",
    "we also assume that the meson decay constants are the same and equal to the pion decay constant @xmath33 as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ingredients of the iam consist of amplitudes of chiral order @xmath9 and @xmath6 of chpt .",
    "an @xmath9 amplitude , denoted by @xmath34 , has a form of a linear function of @xmath35 divided by @xmath36 , and it is of @xmath37 . a polynomial term of the latter amplitudes , denoted by @xmath38 , is written as a sum of polynomial functions with the lecs as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are quadratic functions of @xmath35 and meson mass squared . the polynomial term @xmath41 is of @xmath37 , because @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 as seen in eq.([nc ] ) .",
    "an @xmath44-channel loop term given by @xmath45 is of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the one - loop function regularized as the @xmath48 scheme at the renormalization scale @xmath49@xcite , where @xmath50 is a partial wave amplitude derived from @xmath34 . similarly @xmath51- and @xmath52-channel loop terms and tadpole terms are of @xmath46 , which are ignored in the oop version .",
    "thus , the oop version is expected to be more valid as @xmath0 becomes larger .",
    "the @xmath44-channel loop terms are indispensable to realize unitarity , although they are of @xmath46 .",
    "this difference of the @xmath0 dependence produces the different behavior of the amplitudes when @xmath0 becomes large .",
    "[ tab : ln ]    .@xmath53 [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     our set of the lecs used in this work are determined at the renormalization scale @xmath54 mev so as to reproduce experimental phase shifts qualitatively up to about 1.2 gev .",
    "we note that the iam and oop amplitudes contain the lecs non - linearly and the fitting region is extended to higher energies .",
    "our sets of @xmath28 and @xmath30 are tabulated in table i with the set of the large @xmath0 model,@xcite which correspond to @xmath28 .",
    "the change of the renormalization scale affects values of @xmath30 , but we do not consider the scale change explicitly because the @xmath30 terms fade out as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we emphasize that since the large @xmath0 set can reproduce the low energy scattering behavior rather well even at @xmath13 , except for unessential points , the results are almost the same if we take large @xmath0 set instead of our @xmath28 and put @xmath30 to the difference between our @xmath12 and the large @xmath0 set .",
    "at first , we discuss the behavior of vector mesons in the single channel calculation .",
    "the mass of a vector resonance is controlled by the combination of lec , @xmath55 , @xcite which is present in the term @xmath56 $ ] of @xmath37 , and the loop contribution to the real part is of @xmath46 , so that the mass stays at an almost constant value .",
    "this is the iam expression substituting for the preexisting pole . on the other hand",
    "the imaginary part of the loop term contributes to the width .",
    "the octet component of the isoscalar vector meson    = 10 cm    [ fig : rho ]    = 10 cm    [ fig : kstar ]    also has a constant mass and a residue of @xmath37 below the @xmath57 threshold .",
    "thus , the masses of the vector mesons are of @xmath27 , while the widths decrease as @xmath37 .",
    "if we extend the calculation to the multi - channel iam , the masses are almost unchanged , because the same combination of the lecs dominantly determine the masses . the @xmath0 dependence of the phase shifts and that of the cross sections of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    ". the same behavior is observed in the case of the large @xmath0 set , though the obtained masses are too small because of too large value of @xmath58 .",
    "induces a large cancellation in @xmath59 $ ] even at @xmath13 , so that the resultant amplitude gets a large uncertainty .",
    "but the narrowing width with increasing values of @xmath0 remains valid . ]",
    "thus , we can conclude that the vector mesons described by the oop version have the nature consistent with the @xmath11 mesons .",
    "this channel contains the controversial @xmath61 and the @xmath7 states . using the two - channel iam consisting of the @xmath62 and @xmath57 channels",
    ", we can reproduce experimental data fairly well below 1.2 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the phase shift and the cross section are shown in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath0 increases from 3 to 15 . in contrast to the vector channel we observe that the phase shift becomes flat and",
    "the cross section fades out as @xmath0 becomes large ; the sharp rise of the phase shift near the @xmath57 threshold and the large bump of the cross section near    = 10 cm    [ fig : fig00 ]    = 10 cm    [ fig : pole ]    500 mev seen at @xmath13 to 5 disappears at @xmath63 , and then the phase shift and the cross section become almost flat and fade out .",
    "similar drastic change in the @xmath0 dependence has also been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , though it is in different context .    the @xmath7 pole exists at @xmath64 mev at @xmath13 . where does the pole go as @xmath0 increases ?",
    "we approximately calculate the pole position by expanding the amplitude in powers of @xmath65 up to the first order , where @xmath65 is the momentum of the @xmath57 channel .",
    "we observe that the pole moves into the upper half plane of the iv sheet from the lower half plane of the ii sheet , winding around the branch point at @xmath57 threshold , and goes away from the real axis as shown in the left side of fig .",
    "4 . pole positions at larger",
    "@xmath0 can not be reliable owing to the rough approximation , but this behavior would remain intact .",
    "we briefly comment on effects of adding the @xmath66 channel to the oop amplitude .",
    "if we include the @xmath66 channel , we find that both real and imaginary part of @xmath67 $ ] develop zeros at almost the same point near 770 mev even at @xmath13 for a wide range of the lec sets . such unreasonable behavior is also seen in the isospinor channel with the @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels as will be noted .",
    "these zeros do not violate unitarity , but give very unreasonable behavior to the amplitude , that is too narrow resonant behavior with almost zero width .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the behavior of the amplitude , excluding a narrow strip including the zeros , is almost the same with the behavior of the two - channel model except for a shallow dip of the inelasticity at the @xmath66 threshold@xcite . the unpleasant behavior is not reported in the calculations with full @xmath70@xcite . if we eliminate the unreasonable behavior , the fading - out tendency as increasing @xmath0 remain valid , though the fading - out occurs at larger @xmath0 owing to the additional @xmath71 loop contributions .",
    "this channel contains the @xmath8 state and appears as a cusp - like sharp peak as seen in fig .",
    "= 10 cm    [ fig : fig(10 ) ]    the rising phase shift after the cusp bends down and becomes to a flat curve , and the cross section having a sharp peak fades out as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the pole appears at @xmath73 mev on the ii sheet at @xmath13 , and it moves from the ii sheet to the iv sheet , and leaves rapidly the real axis as shown in the left side of fig .  4 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we note that the real parts of the poles of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states are not necessarily degenerate with each other , though both of the peaks of the mass distribution at @xmath13 appear near the @xmath74 threshold owing to the cusp behavior of the @xmath8 state .",
    "the fading - out behavior of the phase shift and cross section with increasing @xmath0 is the same as that in the channels discussed above . as stated before there appears an artifact zero near 750 mev originated from the @xmath76 component in the oop version used in this work .",
    "so if we eliminate the zero by an interpolation method , we observe that the results by the two channel model are almost the same as those by the single channel calculation by virtue of the weak coupling between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels .",
    "the calculations making use of the full @xmath70 do not give such an unwanted zero  @xcite .",
    "= 10 cm    [ fig : fig(1/20 ) ]",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0 dependence of the vector and scalar channels stating from @xmath13 to finite values , 30 for the vector channel and 12 or 15 for the scalar channel within the approximate iam under the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath42 given by eq.([nc ] ) and @xmath77 .",
    "and we have observed that the vector mesons survive as sharper resonances at almost the same position , the resonant structures of the scalar channels fade out at rather low values of @xmath0 near 5 or 6 . by extending the observation we are led to conclude that the vector meson nonet has the nature consistent with the @xmath11 mesons in large @xmath0 qcd , but the light scalar meson nonet can not survive in large @xmath0 and then can not have the nature of the @xmath11 mesons .",
    "this conclusion is the same as obtained by pelez , excluding an exceptional case of the @xmath8 state,@xcite and it is also consistent with the results obtained in ref .",
    "our conclusion supports the arguments that the light scalar mesons are of the @xmath57 molecule@xcite , and of @xmath78 states@xcite .",
    "if the @xmath10 and @xmath79 states are composed of @xmath80 state , where @xmath81 denotes @xmath52 and/or @xmath82 quark , the similarity between the @xmath10 and @xmath79 both in mass and generating mechanism is expected",
    ". however , the pole positions of the both states can be different from each other by about 100 mev or more , and the generating mechanism of the @xmath8 state would be different from that of @xmath10 state : the @xmath79 state is generated by the strong channel coupling between @xmath83 and @xmath57 channels , but not as a bound state resonance like as the @xmath10 state , as seen in the exchange dynamics@xcite and in the chiral loop dynamics@xcite .",
    "there is also the argument that the @xmath8 and @xmath7 are not elementary particles within the hadronic dynamics@xcite .",
    "they have observed that the field renormalization constants @xmath84 of both states are close to 0 using the propagators of existing models , and concluded that a simple @xmath11 or four quark assignment for the @xmath79 should be considered with caution and it is certainly questionable for the @xmath10 .",
    "if the light scalar nonet are not @xmath11 mesons , we can not include them into mass spectra in the low meson dominance hypothesis , because the low mesons are supposed to participate in narrow resonance towers in large @xmath0 limit of qcd@xcite .",
    "our conclusion strongly indicates that all of the light scalar nonet are dynamical effects originating from unitarity , chiral symmetry and strong channel couplings .",
    "if the mesons in the scalar nonet are dominantly composed of hadronic or four quark component , but include @xmath85 with a small fraction as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we could find out the small @xmath85 component by increasing @xmath0 in theoretical models , because the large hadronic or four quark component fades out and the @xmath11 component remains .",
    "at least , our calculation within the two - channel oop approximation does not indicates that such an intriguing change will occur in larger @xmath0 region .",
