    "the recent beppo - sax observations of fading x - ray afterglows coincident with the positions of gamma - ray bursts grb  970228 ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) and grb  970508 ( piro et al.1998 ) have led to the first identifications of possible burst counterparts in the optical wave band ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ; djorgovski et al.1997 ) . in the optical spectrum associated with the latter burst ,",
    "absorption lines have been detected with a redshift of @xmath2 providing , for the first time , direct evidence for a gamma - ray burst at cosmological distances ( metzger et al.1997 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray fluence of grb  970508 measured by batse is @xmath3erg  @xmath4 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "therefore , if the absorption line measurements give a lower limit on the redshift of the burst , this implies an isotropic burst energy of @xmath5erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "an impulsive event releasing this amount of energy in a compact region naturally leads to a fireball and thence to a relativistic blast - wave .",
    "blast - wave models for gamma - ray bursts have been examined previously in the literature in several contexts .",
    "the most extensive body of work on this topic has been produced by mszros , rees and collaborators ( e.g. , mszros  & rees 1992a ; rees & mszros  1992 ; mszros , laguna & rees 1993 ; wijers , rees & mszros  1997 ; panaitescu & mszros  1998a , 1998b ; et al . ) .",
    "other recent papers include sari & piran ( 1995 ) , vietri ( 1997 ) , waxman ( 1997 ) , and katz & piran ( 1997 ) .",
    "the basic fireball / blast - wave model consists of some triggering event  either coalescing neutron stars or black holes ( mszros  & rees 1992b ) or the collapse of a massive star ( paczyski 1998 ) or a failed type ii supernova ( woosley 1993)depositing a large amount of energy , @xmath7@xmath8  ergs , in a small region with radius @xmath9@xmath10  cm . because of the unavoidable presence of baryonic material , it is expected that the initial fireball energy will be transformed into kinetic energy of these baryons rather than escape as radiation .",
    "this material expands until the internal motions of the baryons become sub - relativistic in the co - moving frame of the material , at which point it forms a cold shell with bulk lorentz factor @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the rest mass of the contaminating baryons .",
    "this shell continues to expand freely into the surrounding ambient medium until the integrated momentum impulse upon the shell by the swept - up matter is equal to the rest mass of the original material , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass density of the external medium .",
    "this defines the so - called deceleration radius @xmath15 ( rees & mszros  1992 ) . beyond this radius",
    ", the shell can no longer be regarded as freely expanding , and the bulk kinetic energy of the blast - wave begins to be reconverted into internal energy .",
    "if this internal energy is radiated promptly , then the deceleration of the blast - wave shell can be approximately described by @xmath16 , and the expansion is said to be in the radiative regime . on the other hand ,",
    "if the internal energy is radiated on a time scale which is long compared to the expansion time scale , then the expansion is in the non - radiative regime , and @xmath17 . in either case , for large initial lorentz factors ,",
    "@xmath18@xmath19 , relativistic effects ( e.g. , rees 1966 ) compress the time scale for the radiation such that the bulk of the blast - wave energy is emitted in the first tens of seconds in the observer s frame following the initial detonation event , thus producing the observed gamma - ray burst .",
    "several authors have pointed out that well after the prompt gamma - ray burst event the blast - wave shell will continue to decelerate and radiate ( vietri 1997 ; waxman 1997 ) .",
    "the recent detections by the x - ray , optical and radio communities of the aforementioned fading x - ray , optical and radio counterparts within the error boxes of grbs appear to support this picture . furthermore , model estimates of the temporal decay of these transients yield time - dependencies which agree with those observed , @xmath20 ( wijers et al .",
    "1997 ) ; and for the one of the bursts for which optical data are available ( grb  970508 ) , the optical spectral index is consistent with synchrotron emission from a power - law distribution of electrons , @xmath21 with @xmath222.3 ( djorgovski et al.1997 ) indicating , for example , a shock - accelerated electron population .    despite the successes of the blast - wave model in accounting for the prompt burst properties and its prediction of fading afterglows ,",
    "several important theoretical questions must be addressed in order to have a reasonably complete model :    * what is the nature of the coupling between the electrons , protons and magnetic field ( panaitescu & mszros  1998b ) ? to what extent",
    "can these components be in equipartition given that only the electrons can efficiently radiate away their energy ? * how does the magnetic field change as the blast - wave decelerates ?",
    "if it is initially formed through equipartition processes , but is not strongly coupled to the non - thermal electron energy density , how does it evolve ? * what is the nature of the acceleration mechanism ?",
    "are the electrons energized by repeated diffusion across the shocks themselves or by gyroresonant scattering with disturbances in the post - shock turbulent mhd fluid ? * what is the proper form for the injected electron energy distributions ?",
    "is it well described by a typical power - law spectrum ?",
    "if so , what determines the characteristic energies of the particles ?    in order to begin to address these questions , it is worthwhile to go beyond the simple , though useful , back - of - the - envelope estimates which have generally prevailed in the literature thus far . in this paper , we present a detailed calculation of the blast - wave deceleration and the evolution of the magnetic fields and electron distributions under various assumptions relevant to the above issues .",
    "we compute model light curves and spectra and use the available afterglow data to help discriminate between the various options .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows : in   2 , we describe the basic dynamics of an impulsively driven blast - wave which decelerates by accretion of ambient material . in   3 , we discuss the physical processes responsible for producing the observed radiation including prescriptions for magnetic field generation , the formation of non - thermal particle distributions and the relevant radiation processes .",
    "the numerical procedures for computing the deceleration of the blast - wave and the integration of the blast - wave shell emission are described in   4 .",
    "model spectra and light curves for gamma - ray bursts are presented and analyzed in   5 .",
    "lastly , in   6 , we discuss these results , explore prospects for further research and present our conclusions .",
    "we assume that a shell of material , with initial proper mass @xmath12 , is injected with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath23 and that its subsequent deceleration is determined by energy and momentum conservation as it accretes mass in the form of matter and internal energy from the ambient medium and loses inertia via radiative processes such as synchrotron or inverse compton emission .",
    "the internal energy of the material is assumed to be initially negligible compared to its rest mass energy .",
    "this corresponds to a time well after the random internal energy of the initial fireball has been converted into the bulk kinetic energy of the spherically expanding shell .",
    "we model the blast - wave as having a cross - sectional area which is a function of the distance traveled @xmath24 .",
    "this functional dependence can be parametrized as a power - law : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the initial radius and surface area of the blast - wave , respectively , and @xmath28 is a collimation factor to account for possible asymmetry of the explosion . in the calculations presented throughout this paper , we consider a spherical blast - wave with @xmath29 .",
    "a straight - forward application of energy and momentum conservation gives the equation of motion of the blast - wave shell as it sweeps up ambient matter .",
    "we obtain the following expression ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bulk lorentz factor of the material , @xmath32 is the total mass including internal kinetic energy , @xmath33 is the _ rest _ mass swept - up in a distance @xmath34 , and the distance traveled @xmath24 is measured in the stationary frame of the explosion .",
    "this frame will be referred to hereafter as the lab frame .",
    "as the blast - wave shell decelerates , its bulk kinetic energy is converted to internal kinetic energy .",
    "if this internal energy is not radiated away then it makes a significant contribution to the inertia of the blast - wave shell . in this case , the mass @xmath35 , in equation  [ equation_of_motion ] , is given by @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 identifies this as the non - radiative case .",
    "in the radiative case , the internal kinetic energy is immediately lost , and the inertia of the blast - wave shell consists only of the rest mass : @xmath38 note that since any radiation is assumed to be isotropic in the co - moving frame of the blast - wave shell , the bulk lorentz factor is unaffected by this radiation and equation  [ equation_of_motion ] still applies .    in the radiative case , @xmath39 , the equation of motion ( eq .  [ equation_of_motion ] )",
    "is separable , and the resulting integrals are elementary .",
    "the solution is @xmath40 ( blandford &  mckee 1976 ) . in the non - radiative case ,",
    "the deceleration is described by a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations : @xmath41 these equations also have an analytic solution .",

    "mass of the ambient material .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is given by @xmath44 for a spherical blast - wave in a uniform external medium , @xmath45 .",

    "energy conservation gives the rate of accreted kinetic energy as a function of time in the lab frame : @xmath58 this expression follows directly from the equation of motion ( eq .  [ equation_of_motion ] ) and therefore applies regardless of whether the blast - wave is radiative or non - radiative .",
    "since the above quantity is a lorentz invariant , it also gives the injected power in the co - moving frame of the blast - wave ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .      in general",
    ", the evolution of the blast - wave shell will be intermediate between the radiative and non - radiative limits . if we denote the radiated power in the co - moving frame as @xmath59 , then the relativistic mass of the material is @xmath60 where the latter integral is performed over co - moving time and represents the relativistic mass lost to radiation .",
    "converting to the lab frame coordinate using @xmath61 , and differentiating wrt @xmath24 , we obtain a more general form for equation  [ dmnrdr ] : @xmath62 this expression must be integrated numerically in conjunction with the equation of motion ( eq .  [ equation_of_motion ] ) .",
    "the radiated power @xmath59 is determined by the co - moving particle distributions and the relevant energy loss mechanisms .",
    "we address these issues in the following sections .",
    "we assume that some fraction , @xmath63 , of the accreted kinetic energy is injected directly into non - thermal electrons .",
    "energization of these electrons may occur via acceleration by shocks ( see e.g. , ellison , baring & jones 1995 ) or by gyroresonant scattering with plasma - wave turbulence induced by the swept - up material ( dermer , miller & li 1996 ) .",
    "however , since we do not model these processes in detail , we adopt a power - law injection spectrum for the electron momenta , @xmath64 . in terms of the initial electron lorentz factors , @xmath65 , this injection spectrum per unit co - moving time",
    "is @xmath66 here the time - dependent normalization of the injection spectrum is given by the prescribed fraction of the power available as kinetic energy : @xmath67 the minimum injected electron lorentz factor in the co - moving frame should be at least as large as the bulk lorentz factor of the blast - wave , @xmath68 .",
    "however , if the electrons are in equipartition with the protons , then the lower cut - off for the electron distribution will be approximately the typical energy of the incident protons in the co - moving frame , @xmath69 ( katz &  piran 1997 ; panaitescu & mszros  1998a ) .",
    "we parametrize the uncertainty between these two extremes with a parameter @xmath70 : @xmath71    the upper cut - off of the electron distribution is given by balancing the radiative losses with the power gained due to the acceleration . by balancing acceleration time scales for both shock and gyroresonant processes with synchrotron loss time scales , de  jager et al.(1996 ; see also de  jager &  harding 1992 ) argue that for a given magnetic field the maximum electron lorentz factor is : @xmath72      at a minimum , the post - shock magnetic field will be that of the ambient external field , amplified by the compression ratio ( @xmath73 for a strong shock ) and the lorentz transformation to the co - moving frame : @xmath74  gauss . here",
    "we have assumed an ambient magnetic field intensity typical for the ism of a few @xmath75 g . even for bulk lorentz factors of @xmath76 ,",
    "this field strength is too low for the electrons to be radiatively efficient .",
    "another source of the magnetic field energy is the remnant field which was created during the initial fireball event and which gets carried along with the expanding blast - wave material . however , if flux freezing holds , i.e. , @xmath77  constant , the field energy will decrease in proportion with the internal energy of the contaminating baryons , and by assumption we only consider the shell after it has expanded to the point at which the shell material is cold in the co - moving frame , hence the remnant field energy density should also be negligible .",
    "if gyroresonant processes mediate the approach to equipartition between the protons and electrons , then it follows that the magnetic field will also be in equipartition with the particles . in true equipartition ,",
    "the bulk of the internal energy will be deposited in components which are themselves not efficient radiators , namely the protons and the magnetic field . however , if strong coupling exists between the electrons , protons and the magnetic field such that these components remain in equipartition even as the electrons efficiently radiate away their kinetic energy , then we would expect the dynamics of the blast - wave to be in the radiative regime ( panaitescu & mszros  1998b ) . in practice",
    ", this would correspond to @xmath78 since the electrons would then be able to tap all of the available internal energy of the blast - wave shell . if the coupling between the magnetic field and particles is weak , then we would expect the internal energy in the protons and magnetic field to remain in the blast - wave and the blast - wave dynamics should be intermediate between radiative and non - radiative . in either case , we would expect that the generated magnetic field energy density will be proportional to the energy density of the swept - up material .",
    "this implies a magnetic field of the form : @xmath79 where we have assumed a compression ratio of 4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 contains all the uncertainties regarding particle - field coupling and the degree to which equipartition is achieved and maintained . in principle , @xmath80 will change with time depending on the complicated plasma physics processes taking place within the blast - wave .",
    "however , we will treat it as a constant and address the implications of this simplification in our discussion below .",
    "the radiation processes which we consider are synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton . an expression for optically thin emission spectra for these processes",
    "are given by dermer , sturner & schlickeiser ( 1997 ) where they use a @xmath81-function approximation for the synchrotron spectrum of a single electron which is centered at the cyclotron frequency and which is normalized by the total synchrotron power .",
    "when convolved with a smooth distribution of electron energies , this approximation provides a reasonably accurate representation of the optically thin synchrotron emissivity : @xmath82 . \\label{synch_spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath83 , @xmath84  g , @xmath85 is the thomson cross - section , and @xmath86 is the electron distribution function .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation breaks down at the end - points of the electron distribution . in order to obtain a more accurate photon spectrum",
    ", we apply a more sophisticated calculation ( crusius &  schlickeiser 1986 ; 1988 ) appropriate for an isotropic distribution of electrons .",
    "however , we note that since the sharp electron cut - offs are themselves approximations , the spectra and light curves due to electrons at these cut - offs should be regarded with caution .    using a similar @xmath81-function approximation , dermer et al .",

    "the non - thermal particle distribution is governed by the equation of continuity in energy space : @xmath90 the losses consist of radiative losses due to synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton emission and adiabatic losses : @xmath91 the first term on the rhs corresponds to the radiative losses where @xmath92 is the energy density of the synchrotron photons which can be up - scattered by an electron with lorentz factor @xmath93 in the thomson limit : @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the synchrotron photon number spectral density .",
    "the second term on the rhs of equation  [ particle_losses ] is the expansion losses where @xmath96 is the volume of the emitting material .",
    "however , since the relevant radiative loss time scales are much shorter than the expansion time scales , we neglect the adiabatic loss term .",
    "we also find that bremsstrahlung losses can be neglected compared to the synchrotron and ssc losses .",
    "the evolution of the particle distribution is computed by integrating equation  [ electron_continuity_eqn ] using an implicit finite differencing scheme ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath97 here @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and the source term , @xmath100 , is the injection function given by equation  [ injection_function ] .",
    "this implicit finite differencing scheme yields a tridiagonal system of equations which is readily inverted to give the electron distribution as a function of time .",
    "we note that the losses associated with the ssc term depend on the electron distribution function through @xmath92 and must be determined self - consistently .",
    "this is achieved by iteration until the electron distribution has converged .      if the kinetic energy deposited in the electrons is immediately radiated , then equation  [ dmdr ] is equivalent to @xmath101 .",

[ deraddt_est ] ) from this simple forward - stepped integration is then used as input for a variable step - size runge - kutta integrator and the process is repeated until convergence . only for very low magnetic fields , @xmath111 of the equipartition value , are several additional iterations required in order to obtain convergence .      using the electron distribution function from the integration of the equation of continuity and the expressions for the synchrotron and ssc emissivities , we compute the radiation in the co - moving frame of the blast - wave shell .",
    "because of light travel time effects , emission from the blast - wave shell at different lab frame times contributes to the observed flux at a given observer time .",
    "hence , in the observer frame , the flux at any given time will consist of an integration of the emission over the course of the blast - wave expansion .",

    "such a break would manifest itself as curvature in the high energy tail above @xmath203 . if the electron injection index is @xmath228 , then the peak in @xmath229 may actually correspond to the transition between cooled and uncooled power - law electron distributions .",
    "more likely , however , the peak in @xmath229 will correspond to the synchrotron emission from the electrons at the upper cut - off ( unless this upper cut - off energy is very high ) . in this case",
    ", there will be a spectral break between @xmath209 and @xmath230 below the peak in @xmath229 and an exponential cut - off above the peak ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "none of the bursts for which good spectra are available show an exponential cut - off above the @xmath229 peak or a spectral index change of @xmath231 at the peak itself ( tavani 1996 ; schaefer et al .",

    "as the low energy electron cut - off evolves downward due to cooling , the hard , low energy part of the synchrotron spectrum will also move downward in energy .",
    "the evolution of the bulk lorentz factor as the blast - wave decelerates contributes to this effect as well . at lower observer energies ,",
    "the light curve will peak later and the spectral index will get softer with time . however , the precise shape of the light curve in any given band is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties in the nature of the electron cut - off and the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "the general trend of hard - to - soft evolution should nevertheless hold , even if only qualitatively .",
    "once the blast - wave has evolved so that the emission of the cooled power - law electron distribution lies within the optical band - pass , a measurement of the electron distribution power - law index can be inferred from optical afterglow data . for the afterglow of grb  970508",
    ", the optical energy spectral index is @xmath232 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is consistent with a cooled power - law distribution with @xmath233 .",

    "in addition to the evolution of the electron distribution injection index , it is expected that the magnetic field will not stay at a constant fraction of its equipartition value .",
    "if there is some sort of time scale , @xmath237 , for particle - field equipartition to obtain , then one might expect that @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the dynamical time scale of the blast - wave expansion in the co - moving frame . from equation  [ peak_energy ] ,",
    "bursts which peak at 1  mev have weak magnetic fields with @xmath240 for @xmath158 .",
    "this implies a rather long equipartition time scale of @xmath241  s. even for a non - radiative burst , this time scale is reached only after the burst has almost completely decelerated .",
    "most likely , particle - field equilibration is a highly non - linear process and thus can not be parametrized as a simple linear function of time .",
    "the lack of a proper theory describing such processes poses a major uncertainty in using the characteristics of the prompt gamma - ray burst to set model parameters for extrapolation of the behavior of the blast - wave to describe the emission at much later times .",
    "nonetheless , for purposes of illustration , we present a calculation which largely matches the observed properties of typical prompt grb emission . in as much as the spectral slopes for grbs below the @xmath242 peak are consistent with @xmath209 ( schaefer et al.1998 ) ,",
    "the limiting values of @xmath243 and @xmath244 apply .",

    "[ standard_calc ] , it demonstrates the variety of afterglow behaviors which can be obtained .    in figure  [ best_bet]b ,",
    "the gamma - ray emission in the prompt burst extends up to 1  gev , well into the egret energy range ( cf .",
    "dingus 1995 ) , the initial rises in the x - ray and optical light curves follow that of the prompt burst itself by @xmath247  s and @xmath248  s , respectively . however , because of the steeper injection index implied by the prompt burst , the flux in the x - ray band decays as @xmath249 , significantly faster than that measured for grb  970508 ( piro et al .",
    "the optical light curve decays somewhat slower as @xmath250 since the optical emission corresponds to the flatter part of the spectrum near the peak in @xmath251 .",
    "the prompt burst spectrum evolves from hard to soft , and its time scale is @xmath252  seconds .",
    "the radio light curve is rising as @xmath253 and the radio spectral index is @xmath209 .",
    "furthermore , this model makes the prediction of tev emission due to ssc processes which should peak at a time comparable to the peak in the x - rays .",
    "in this paper , we have attempted a more realistic calculation of the dynamics and synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton emission for the blast - wave model of gamma - ray bursts . by matching the detailed characteristics of burst spectra",
    ", we have found relations ( eqs .",
    "[ gamma_limit ] &  [ xi_b_limit ] ) which place constraints on magnetic field strengths and bulk lorentz factors .",
    "if these relations are to be believed , then burst data can have a significant impact on models of magnetic field generation in turbulent plasmas .",
    "the apparent deficiencies of this calculation point towards areas of further research . in particular , the detailed temporal structure of individual bursts is not explicitly dealt with in this model . in the context of external shocks",
    ", it may be due to inhomogeneities in the external medium , or fluctuations in the electron injection and/or magnetic field equipartition parameters ( panaitescu & mszros1998a ) . for @xmath224 ,",
    "the generalized expression for the luminosity for energies @xmath254 ( eq .  [ peak_luminosity ] ) is @xmath255 where @xmath256 applies for relatively strong magnetic fields @xmath257 when the electrons just above the break are efficiently cooled and @xmath258 applies for relatively weak fields and uncooled electrons . from this expression we see that any burst light curve substructure must be due to variations in @xmath63 and @xmath157 , and indirectly , due to variations in @xmath80 through @xmath203 ( eq .  [ peak_energy ] ) .",
    "our treatment of the dynamics also ignores the structure of the shock region itself , and our approach essentially only considers the emission from the forward shock and neglects the reverse shock .",
    "panaitescu & mszros  ( 1998a ) have performed calculations similar to our own , but from a hydrodynamical perspective , and found that the reverse shock only makes a significant contribution to the emission at optical and uv energies .",
    "therefore , neglecting the reverse shock should not affect our results for the gamma - ray emission , but it could have a significant impact on the optical and radio afterglow emission .",
    "we also neglect the thickness , @xmath259 , of the shock shell in integrating the emission for a given observer time @xmath122 .",
    "this should not be important at early times when @xmath260 ( in the lab frame ) , but it could affect the afterglow emission at late times .",
    "it is unlikely that the blast - wave itself is spherical .",
    "if the initial fireball is created by the coalescence of two compact objects , then the orbital plane defines a natural axis of symmetry along which the blast - wave will propagate ( mszros  & rees 1992b ) .",
    "this sort of asymmetry could be accounted for in our model by a non - unity collimation factor , @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , if the observer line - of - sight does not lie within the opening angle of the blast - wave cone , then other effects due to relativistic beaming and the gradual deceleration of the shock front would be introduced . in this respect ,",
    "highly anisotropic blast - waves would share properties with relativistic jets in blazars .",
    "this analogy can be take even further by noting the similarity of the burst spectra we derive compared to that of gamma - ray blazars . like our model spectra , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these objects tend to have two peaks , one in the uv  x - ray range and one at gamma - ray energies",
    ". if the lower peak in blazar seds is due to synchrotron emission and corresponds to the @xmath222  mev peak in gamma - ray bursts , we can apply a similar analysis as we have discussed above to derive bulk lorentz factors and equipartition parameters for blazars .",
    "in particular , the recent asca observations of mrk  421 ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996 ) provide sufficient information to get actual values rather than simply upper or lower limits . using the light curves of mrk  421 measured in different x - ray energy bands , takahashi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed a cross - correlation analysis and found that the longer relative time lags of the lower energy data versus the higher energy data are consistent with synchrotron cooling of the underlying electron distribution .",
    "several authors have noted this effect and have calculated this temporal dependence for the cases of bursts and blazars ( e.g. , tashiro et al .  1995 ; tavani 1996 ;",
    "dermer 1998 ) .",
    "takahashi et al .  use the tev variability time scale ( kerrick et al .",
    "1995 ) to estimate a doppler factor and find @xmath261 ( cf .",
    "takahara 1994 ) . using this estimate and their time lag measurements ,",
    "they derive a magnetic field of @xmath262  g. from non - simultaneous data ( shrader & wehrle 1997 ) , the synchrotron portion of the sed of mrk  421 peaks at about @xmath263ev . using @xmath264 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ peak_energy ] ) , and @xmath265 , we find @xmath266 and an observer angle @xmath267 .",
    "we also obtain an equipartition field strength of @xmath268  g implying an equipartition parameter of @xmath269 .",
    "although the above value for the bulk lorentz factor is substantially larger than the mean value of @xmath270 found by applying the beaming model to a sample of radio - loud objects ( urry & padovani 1995 ) , its large value may indicate the special nature of gamma - ray loud blazars which are characterized not only by small observing angles but also by larger than typical bulk lorentz factors . despite the crudeness of this calculation",
    ", it illustrates the potential applicability of this sort of analysis to blazars as well as bursts .",
