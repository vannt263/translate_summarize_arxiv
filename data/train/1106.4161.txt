    "due to the largest cross section of all processes at the hadron colliders dijet production opens a possibility to search for a signal , @xmath3 , of new physics in the very early data .",
    "in particular , a bump in the dijet invariant mass distribution would indicate the presence of a resonance decaying into two energetic partons .",
    "however , due to the huge qcd background , @xmath4 , it is necessary to optimize signal significance ratio , @xmath5 , in order to enhance the bump .",
    "the distribution of dijets over the polar angle @xmath6 , being angle between the axis of the jet pair and the beam direction in the dijet rest frame , is directly sensitive to the dynamics of the underlying process .",
    "while the qcd processes are dominated by @xmath7-channel gluon exchanges , which lead to a rutherford - like distribution @xmath8 , exotic physics processes proceed mainly through the @xmath3-channel , where the spins of the resonance and of the initial and final parton states uniquely define the angular distributions .",
    "the absolute value of the dijet rapidity difference is related to the polar scattering angle @xmath6 with respect to the beam axis by @xmath9\\ge 0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the qcd background contribution on this variable is dominated by the exponential growing factor @xmath10 from the rutherford scattering .",
    "the choice of the other variable @xmath11 is motivated by the fact that rutherford scattering does not depend on it and the qcd distribution is almost flat .    in the next section",
    "we will consider a model independent signal distributions of new physics from resonances up to spin of one and corresponding @xmath12 cut optimizations for signal significance .",
    "present analysis is based on a study of dijet mass angular distributions  @xcite , which has been shown to play important role in disentangling of the resonance properties revealing the unique signature of the excited bosons .",
    "let us consider different possibilities for the spin of a resonance and its possible interactions with partons .",
    "the simplest case of the resonance production of a ( pseudo)scalar particle @xmath13 with spin 0 in @xmath3-channel leads to a uniform decay distribution on the scattering angle @xmath14    the spin-1/2 fermion resonance , like an excited quark @xmath15 , leads to asymmetric decay distributions for the given spin parton configurations @xmath16 and @xmath17 however , the choice of the variables , which depend on the absolute value of @xmath18 , cancels out the apparent dependence on @xmath18 . in other words , the distributions",
    "( [ g12 ] ) and ( [ g-12 ] ) for dijet events look like uniform distributions ( [ g0 ] ) .    according to the simple formula",
    "@xmath19 the uniform distribution leads to kinematical peaks at @xmath20 ( the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath21    according to @xcite there are only two different cases for the spin-1 resonances depending on their interactions with light fermions .",
    "usually the gauge bosons @xmath22 , @xmath23 and axigluons have minimal gauge interactions with the known light fermions @xmath24 which preserve the fermion chiralities and possess maximal helicities @xmath25 . at a isospin - symmetric @xmath26 collider , like the lhc",
    ", such interactions lead to the specific symmetric angular distribution of the resonance decay products over the polar angle @xmath6 , @xmath27 similar to the uniform distribution , eq .",
    "( [ gll ] ) also leads to kinematical peaks at @xmath20 ( the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath28    another possibility is the resonance production and decay of new longitudinal spin-1 bosons with helicity @xmath29 .",
    "the new gauge bosons with such properties arise in many extensions  @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) , which solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "they transform as doublets @xmath30 under the fundamental representation of the sm @xmath31 group like the sm higgs boson and , therefore , have not minimal gauge interactions with the known light fermions .",
    "while the @xmath22 bosons with helicities @xmath25 are produced in left(right)-handed quark and right(left)-handed antiquark fusion , the longitudinal @xmath32 bosons are produced through the anomalous chiral couplings with the ordinary light fermions @xmath33}+{\\rm h.c.}\\ ] ] in left - handed or right - handed quark - antiquark fusion  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous interactions ( [ lr ] ) are generated on the level of the quantum loop corrections and can be considered as effective interactions .",
    "the gauge doublets , coupled to the tensor quark currents , are some types of `` excited '' states as far as the only orbital angular momentum with @xmath34 contributes to the total angular moment , while the total spin of the system is zero .",
    "this property manifests itself in their derivative couplings to fermions and a different chiral structure of the interactions in contrast to the minimal gauge interactions ( [ ll ] ) .",
    "the anomalous couplings lead to a different angular distribution of the resonance decay @xmath35 than the previously considered ones . at first sight",
    ", the small difference between the distributions ( [ gll ] ) and ( [ glr ] ) seems unimportant .",
    "however , the absence of the constant term in the latter case results in novel experimental signatures .",
    "a striking feature of the distribution ( [ glr ] ) is the forbidden decay direction perpendicular to the boost of the excited boson in the rest frame of the latter ( the collins  soper frame  @xcite ) .",
    "it leads to a profound dip at @xmath36 in the collins  soper frame  @xcite in comparison with the scalar and gauge boson distributions .",
    "the same dips present also at @xmath37  @xcite ( the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath38    it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] that the excited bosons have unique signature in the angular distributions .",
    "they manifest themselves through the absolute minimum at @xmath20 and absolute maximum at @xmath39 .",
    "from fig .  [ fig : angular ] one can be seen that all signal distributions decrease at @xmath40 , while the qcd background increases exponentially with @xmath12 ( as discussed in the introduction ) .",
    "therefore , applying the cut @xmath41 ( i.e. considering dijet events with @xmath41 only ) one can enhance the signal significance , @xmath42 , choosing the maximum of the corresponding distribution .",
    "so , we can define the relative signal significance as the ratio of the integrals of the normalized signal distributions ( [ dy0 ] ) , ( [ dy1prime ] ) , ( [ dy1star ] ) to the qcd background distribution @xmath43    then the significance for the isotropic distribution @xmath44 reaches the maximum at @xmath45 ( the dotted curve in fig .  [ fig : sig ] ) .",
    "the gauge bosons with the minimal coupling ( [ ll ] ) possess almost similar distribution as the scalar and spin-1/2 particles ( the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] ) @xmath46 with the maximum at @xmath47{764 + 36\\sqrt{401}}/2 + 20/\\sqrt[3]{764 + 36\\sqrt{401}})-\\ln3 \\approx 1.34 $ ] .",
    "these numbers coincide with the selection cut @xmath48 applied by the cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite collaborations for the resonance search in dijet events . however , it is obviously not optimal for the excited bosons search due to very different shape of the angular distribution .",
    "indeed , direct expression of the signal significance function for the excited bosons @xmath49 lead to the maximum at @xmath50 ( the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] ) .",
    "therefore , application of the usually accepted cut at @xmath48 drastically reduces the number of signal events from the excited bosons . in other words , there are no model independent cuts for the resonance search with different spin properties .    since the peak of the excited boson distribution is shifted from the origin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) , one can expect that applying a more sophisticated cut @xmath51 the absolute maximum of the signal significance function of the two variables @xmath52 can be found .",
    "precise solution of this problem leads to the following values of the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the maximum .",
    "however , an impact of this solution is expressed in 1.3% gain in comparison with the maximum of the expression ( [ sig1star ] ) .    in order to confirm the event excess in the invariant dijet mass distribution one can use the various ratios of angular distributions ( see @xcite ) . they do not only allow to discover a resonance but also to reveal its properties . in @xcite new observable @xmath55 has been introduced , as the fraction of dijet events produced centrally versus the events number in more wide region for a specified dijet mass range . it has been used for quark contact interaction search at the following parameter values @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    "we will show that the same observable with appropriated parameters can be used for a resonance search as well .",
    "for example , in the case of the isotropic distribution one can maximize the deviation from the qcd ratio @xmath58 @xmath59 since @xmath60 and @xmath61 the absolute maximum appears at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    for the spin-1 resonances the expressions @xmath64 are",
    "more complicated and solutions can not be expressed through radicals .",
    "so , for the gauge bosons with the minimal interactions @xmath65 and the absolute maximum is reached at @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for the both considered cases",
    "there are only positive contributions to @xmath68 from the new physics and @xmath68 is always greater than @xmath69 .",
    "by contrast to this , the excited bosons represent more interesting case with absolute minimum and maximum at @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , correspondingly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] ) ,    due to a peculiar shape of the angular distribution @xmath74 .",
    "since the scalar resonances peak at origin more stronger than spin-1 gauge bosons with the minimal couplings and the maximum of the excited bosons distribution is shifted away from the origin , they have decreasing relative signal sensitivities at their maxima @xmath75 here we assume the same production cross section for all resonances .",
    "moreover , if the selection cut @xmath76 is applied for the case of the excited bosons search , it reduces 1.6 times the sensitivity than the optimal cut @xmath77 . for example , if a some insignificant 2@xmath78 excess is observed for the commonly accepted cut , it could become an evidence for the optimal cut in the excited bosons case .    in order to obtain absolute signal significances for some models",
    "we have used the calchep package  @xcite .",
    "let us compare two models  @xcite for the charged spin-1 resonances @xmath23 and @xmath79 with mass of 1 tev , which have the same production cross sections at the lhc in the leading order approximation .",
    "the signal events and qcd background have been generated with mrst2007lomod pdfs at 7  tev center - of - mass energy and the following jet cuts : @xmath80  gev and @xmath81 .    in order to optimize search the additional selection cut",
    "@xmath82 has been applied in the case of @xmath23 resonances and @xmath83 for the @xmath79 case .",
    "so , already 100  pb@xmath84 is enough to obtain 5@xmath78 signal significance in the first case and 230  pb@xmath84 for the second case .",
    "if we have applied @xmath82 cut for the excited boson @xmath79 , 560  pb@xmath84 will be necessary to reach the same sensitivity .",
    "it should be stressed also , that the ratio @xmath68 is less affected by the systematic errors .",
    "however , the impact of new physics from the different resonances to @xmath68 occurs as @xmath85 therefore , the contribution of spin-1 resonances and mainly the excited bosons are more suppressed than in ( [ propsig ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the excited bosons a unique possibility exists that the absolute minimum and maximum are present . in these cases we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , correspondingly .",
    "although the absolute minimum is 1.3 times dipper than the maximum value , more wider regions in the later case lead to smaller uncertainties .",
    "it will allow to verified once again the excited bosons signature .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to note that in this paper we have considered the novel optimization of angular cuts aimed at the most effective search for the new resonances with different angular distributions of their decay products .",
    "simple analytical formulas have been obtained .",
    "even for the same resonance spin there are different optimized cuts with respect to the resonance interactions .",
