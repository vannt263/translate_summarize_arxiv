    "in this paper i present an overview of the predictions for pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 tev at the large hadron collider , mainly based on the material presented during the workshop heavy ion collisions at the lhc - last call for predictions , held in the frame of the cern theory institute from may 14th to june 10th 2007 @xcite . such compilation ( see also @xcite , and @xcite for the analogous one for rhic ) should be useful for : ( a ) distinguishing pre- from post - dictions ; ( b ) assuming that a model tested at rhic ( and eventually sps ) energies can be extrapolated to the lhc , the huge lever arm in energy provides very strong constraints ; and ( c ) providing a frozen image of our present understanding of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "i have classified the predictions in : bulk properties ( section 2 ) : multiplicities ( see pre - rhic predictions in @xcite ) , azimuthal asymmetries , hadronic flavor observables and correlations at low transverse momentum ; and hard and electromagnetic probes ( section 3 ) : high transverse momentum observables and jets , quarkonium and heavy quarks , and leptonic probes and photons , extensively documented in @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the predictions presented here can be found in @xcite and will be referenced by the name of their first author .",
    "finally i draw some conclusions .",
    "multiplicity is a first - day observable .",
    "it plays a central role , as practically all other predictions require directly or indirectly such input . in fig .",
    "[ armestofig1 ] sixteen predictions for charged hadron multiplicities at mid - rapidity in central collisions can be found .        to compare the different predictions more accurately ,",
    "we re - scale them to a common observable ( @xmath1 ) and centrality class ( @xmath2 ) using the model @xcite .",
    "the re - scaling factors can be read from table [ armestotable1 ] and the corrected results found in fig .",
    "[ armestofig2 ] .",
    ".results in the monte carlo code in @xcite of the mean impact parameter , number of participants and binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , and charged multiplicity at mid-(pseudo-)rapidity , for different centrality classes defined by the number of participants . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     predictions can be roughly classified into those based on saturation physics ( abreu et al . ,",
    "albacete , armesto et al .",
    ", eskola et al . , fujii et al . , kharzeev et al . ) , data - driven predictions ( busza , jeon et al . ) , those based on percolation ideas ( dias de deus et al . ) , those containing strong shadowing ( capella et al . ) , monte carlo models ( topor pop et al .",
    ", bopp et al . , chen et al . , porteboeuf et al . )",
    "in which many physical mechanisms are combined , parton cascades ( el et al . ) , and those based on diffusion equations ( wolschin et al . ) .",
    "they tend to lie in the range @xmath3 , the lowest values corresponding to extreme saturation models and data - driven predictions .",
    "these values are generically much lower than pre - rhic predictions @xcite .",
    "most models contain now a large degree of collectivity in the form of saturation , strong gluon shadowing , percolation , etc .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries are another first - day observable .",
    "generically , @xmath4-integrated @xmath5 is expected to increase in all models .",
    "on the other hand , data - driven extrapolations @xcite tend to disagree with hydrodynamical models , and there are differences in the expectations for @xmath6 .",
    "gathering the predictions in rough categories and focusing on the difference between @xmath5 at small @xmath7 gev / c at rhic and at the lhc , we find :    * hydrodynamical predictions : drescher et al .",
    ", on the basis of a simple model , predict deviations from ideal hydro seen at rhic , to diminish at the lhc .",
    "bluhm et al .",
    "kestin et al . and eskola et al .",
    "predict @xmath5 at small @xmath4 to be similar or slightly smaller than at rhic on the basis of ideal hydrodynamics . increasing viscous corrections",
    "would further diminish @xmath6 , although the initial conditions for evolution have to be settled .",
    "* non - hydro predictions : porteboeuf et al .",
    "find a similar @xmath6 at the lhc than at rhic , in the epos model . on the other hand , chen et al . in the ampt model , and the absorption model of capella et al .",
    ", show a moderate to strong increase .",
    "the parton cascade of molnar indicates that at fixed viscosity - to - entropy ratio , @xmath6 should decrease with increasing energy .",
    "this offers a possible interpretation of the results in ampt or absorption models in terms of an effective diminishing of the viscosity - to - entropy ratio due to the increasing parton / particle density .",
    "three different groups of observables can be discussed :    * particle ratios are usually studied in the framework of statistical hadronization models . both andronic et al . and kraus et al .",
    "predict all antiparticle - to - particle ratios to be very close to 1 for the small @xmath8 gev expected at the lhc at mid - rapidity , with only @xmath9/p being slightly smaller .",
    "the latter group shows the sensitivity of multi - strange - to - non - strange hadron ratios on the temperature , and to deviations from the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "finally , rafelski et al .",
    "show how non - equilibrium scenarios reflect on an increase of multi - strange hadron yields and a decrease of non - strange resonances , for several total multiplicity predictions .",
    "so different statistical hadronization scenarios could be distinguished .",
    "this becomes of capital importance in regeneration models for open and hidden heavy flavor production , as shown by the differences between the equilibrium ( andronic et al . ) and the non - equilibrium ( kuznetsova et al . ) predictions .",
    "* net baryon number at mid - rapidity : p@xmath9 is generically predicted @xmath10 in a wide variety of models : those including the baryon junction mechanism like hijing b / bbar ( topor pop et al . ) or dpmjet ( bopp et al . ) , ideal hydro ( eskola et al . ) , epos ( porteboeuf et al . ) and rdm ( wolschin et al . ) . * baryon - to - meson ratios : ideal hydro ( kestin et al . ) and recombination ( chen et al . )",
    "models predicts larger values than models which consider the creation of large color fields ( topor pop et al . , cunqueiro et al . ) .",
    "the latter predict the cronin effect for protons to survive at the lhc .",
    "both observables will clarify the hadronization and baryon - transport mechanisms .      concerning the hbt radii , all models ( chen et al .",
    "in ampt , kestin et al . with ideal hydro , the non - equilibrium scenarios of sinyukov et al . and karpenko et al . , and the recent work @xcite ) predict an increase , although the density ( i.e. total multiplicity ) dependence of such increase varies from model to model .",
    "nevertheless , the predictive power is limited by the problems that the models face to reproduce rhic data ( i.e. the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and their relative magnitude ) , and the poor understanding of the role of dissipative effects .",
    "before discussing the predictions , let me stress that the control of the benchmark for hard and electromagnetic probes will be at the lhc as key an aspect as it was at rhic . for example , a basic ingredient as the extrapolation of nuclear parton densities to the lhc kinematical region , is under poor control .",
    "this can be seen e.g. in the factor @xmath14 uncertainty in the nuclear effects for the gluon distribution in pb at @xmath15 that can be extracted from the comparison of the results shown in @xcite and the recent work @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ armestofig3 ] , i gather thirteen predictions for the nuclear suppression factor @xmath16 in central collisions , for two values of @xmath17 and 50 gev / c .",
    "predictions can be roughly classified into those based on radiative and/or collisional energy loss in pqcd ( dainese et al .",
    ", renk et al .",
    ", qin et al . , wicks et al . , jeon et al . , liu et al . ,",
    "lokhtin et al . , vitev , and wang et al . ) , those based on absorption scenarios ( capella et al . and",
    "kopeliovich et al . ) , those based on percolation ( cunqueiro et al . ) and the opaque core - transparent corona model of pantuev .",
    "the generic expectation in pqcd - based models is that @xmath18 and increasing with increasing @xmath4 .     at @xmath17 (",
    "filled symbols ) and 50 ( open symbols ) gev / c from different models @xcite . on the right",
    "the authors of the predictions , the hadron species for which @xmath19 has been calculated , the centrality class , the density / multiplicity input , an indication in case the highest @xmath4 is 40 gev / c instead of 50 , and a brief description of the model ingredients , are provided .",
    "the error bars reflect the uncertainties coming from the multiplicity / density input but in capella et al .",
    ", qin et al . and wang et al . , where they correspond to the variation of kinematics for particle production , @xmath20 and nucleon / nuclear parton densities respectively.,height=427 ]    another aspect is the hadro - chemistry at large @xmath4 , which in pqcd - based models is expected to be modified both by the different energy loss of quarks and gluons ( barnafoldi et al . ) , by the modification of the parton cascade inside the medium ( sapeta et al . ) , and by additional mechanisms as conversions ( liu et al . ) .",
    "finally , jet reconstruction and other differential observables like the yield in the away - side peak ( see predictions in lokhtin et al . and wang et al .",
    "respectively ) will offer new possibilities to constraint models .",
    "all these aspects will help to verify the mechanism underlying the jet quenching phenomenon observed at rhic .",
    "concerning heavy quarks , radiative energy loss models predict that the modification of the suppression pattern due to the mass of the quark will be visible in @xmath21 for heavy mesons and double ratios @xmath22 up to quite large @xmath23 gev / c ( armesto et al .",
    ", wicks et al . ) .",
    "these doubles ratios have also discriminatory power on the mechanism for energy loss ( horowitz et al . ) .",
    "a common feature to all pqcd - based mechanisms is that hadronization is supposed to happen outside the medium , which could not be the case for low @xmath4 , where different mechanisms might be at work ( van hees et al . ,",
    "vitev ) .",
    "concerning quarkonium suppression and production , the main uncertainty in recombination models for the magnitude of the suppression or enhancement lies in the heavy quark cross section ( andronic et al . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath4-broadening as a tool to verify the recombination mechanism ( thews et al . ) suffers from large uncertainties due to cold nuclear matter effects which should be clarified ( kang et al . ) before any firm conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the pattern of the suppression of the different quarkonium states versus @xmath4 should be measurable at the lhc .",
    "it offers a possibility to distinguish ( vogt ) the different scenarios of sequential melting derived from either potential models or lattice computations , as well as new possibilities suggested in the framework of super - symmetric versions of qcd at strong coupling ( h. liu et al . ) .",
    "finally , predictions which could be directly compared with experimental data , based on co - mover dissociation plus recombination , can be found in @xcite . in any case , the considerable uncertainties in the mechanisms of quarkonium production and suppression limit our predictive power .      concerning photon production at large @xmath4 , predictions in the frame of pqcd - based models containing radiative energy loss are available ( arleo , vitev ) . at small @xmath4 , other mechanisms as thermal production ( arleo et al . ) , conversions @xcite or different types of factorization ( rezaeian et al . )",
    "could be at work .",
    "the measurement of @xmath5 for photons also offers some discriminatory power .",
    "ideal hydro models ( chatterjee et al . ) indicate that @xmath5 below @xmath24 gev / c should be dominated by the partonic phase of the expansion of the medium . at the lhc , both high- and low-@xmath4 photons",
    "will be measurable , but an accurate understanding of the benchmark will be key to disentangle a thermal contribution over the other possible , background effects .    concerning dileptons , nayak et al .",
    "propose the ratio real - to - virtual photons as sensitive to the temperature of the initial phase and weakly dependent on the details of expansion , eos , etc .",
    "dremin proposed the cherenkov effect as a mechanism which could mimic an apparent broadening of the @xmath25 .",
    "finally , predictions for the dilepton mass spectrum for both large- ( fries et al . ) and small-@xmath4 ( van hees et al . ) regions , are available .",
    "the intermediate mass region @xmath26 gev / c@xmath27 suffers from a large background from heavy meson semi - leptonic decays .",
    "therefore the understanding of the benchmark looks crucial again to disentangle a thermal component .",
    "we are getting closer and closer to the moment when rhic - tested models will be confronted to lhc experimental results .",
    "for every observation at rhic which is considered one of its major discoveries , an interpretation has been proposed and the corresponding predictions for the lhc have been computed . in this way :    * the charged multiplicity at mid - rapidity , sizably lower than expectations @xcite , is interpreted in terms of a large degree of coherence or collectivity in particle production .",
    "it leads to predictions for central collisions at the lhc smaller than 2000 charged particles per unit pseudo - rapidity at @xmath28 . *",
    "@xmath5 in agreement with ideal hydrodynamical models is interpreted as the creation of an almost perfect fluid , leading to the prediction that @xmath5 at small @xmath4 will be at the lhc similar or smaller than at rhic . *",
    "the observed strong jet quenching leads to the conclusions that the created medium is dense , partonic and opaque , resulting in an @xmath18 for central collisions at the lhc .",
    "this picture has already motivated many theoretical developments : applications of ads / cft , mechanisms for early thermalization , viscous hydro , the cgc , etc .",
    "major deviations from the generic expectations outlined here will enlarge our understanding of the physics of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions - note that naive , data - driven extrapolations @xcite tend to disagree with predictions from successful models at rhic .",
    "besides , the lhc experiments , with their unprecedented capabilities @xcite , will provide new observables like jets or higher quarkonium states - not or only marginally measurable at rhic - for which a large theoretical effort is still required .",
