    "in the recent years much interest has turned to the study of the casimir energy for spherical configurations .",
    "the issue concerns in particular the attempt to explain by means of qft the puzzling phenomenon of sonoluminescence @xcite , that is the emission of short intense pulses of light by collapsing bubbles of air in water . up to now the hypothesis that the casimir energy could play a role in the photon emission has not been supported enough by a satisfactory qft - model for the dielectric _",
    "ball_. to calculate the casimir energy for such a ball could be of great importance to compare , in the statical approximation , the order of magnitude of this energy with the effectively observed light pulses .",
    "many authors have already studied a perfectly conducting spherical shell in the vacuum of the electromagnetic field , we cite here only paper @xcite , other authors have investigated the conducting shell for massive fields @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose the more realistic model of a semi - trasparent shell . in calculating the ground state energy we use zeta regularisation techniques and jost function approach .",
    "the heat kernel coefficients for a penetrable sphere have alreay been calculated in a very recent work @xcite .",
    "we carry out the complete calculations in order to find the exact numerical dependence of the ground state energy on the radius of the sphere .",
    "we want to study the ground state energy ( gse ) of the scalar field @xmath0 ( to be quantized ) in the background of a potential @xmath1 .",
    "we will consider the following field equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the field .",
    "the spherical shell is a geometrical object with radius @xmath4 and a surface @xmath5 , to whom it can be associated a classical energy in terms of classical parameters .",
    "the total energy of the system reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the volume of the sphere , @xmath8 is the pressure , @xmath9 is the surface tension and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are other parameters .",
    "the classical energy is expressed in a general dimensionally suitable form which depends on powers of @xmath4 , this definition is useful ( as we will discuss later ) for its renormalization . the quantum contribution in ( 2 ) is the traditional expression for the vacuum energy of a scalar field whose energy eigenvalues are @xmath13 . to render the eigenvalues of the energy discrete we take a finite quantization volume with radius @xmath14 .",
    "+ the classical shell is static and spherically symmetric .",
    "it is described by a potential @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the magnitude of the potential .",
    "the semi transparency of the boundary will be imposed later . the quantum contribution to the total energy",
    "is divergent , for the regularization we adopt a zeta function technique .",
    "we define a regularized ground state energy @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary mass parameter , @xmath19 is the regularization parameter which we will put to zero after renormalization and @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of the wave equation @xmath21 \\phi _ { ( n)}(x)=\\lambda _ { ( n)}^2   \\phi _ { ( n)}(x ) .\\ ] ] now we introduce a zeta function .",
    "the zeta function of the wave operator with potential @xmath1 as defined in ( 5 ) is @xmath22 then we can express the ground state energy in terms of the zeta function @xmath23 since is valid the equalty @xmath24 we can write eq.(6 ) in the following form @xmath25 or @xmath26 that is @xmath27 the function @xmath28 represents the heat kernel . now taking the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for @xmath29 @xmath30 and making the substitution @xmath31 in eq.(11 ) , we get an expansion of @xmath32 in which it s easy to isolate all the divergent ( pole ) terms .",
    "this makes possible to define a total divergent contribution to the ground state energy @xmath33 the @xmath34 are the heat kernel coefficients . in the definition ( 13 )",
    "we have included the fractionary terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which do not contain poles , to satisfy a renormalization condition ( see below ) .",
    "actually only the first three terms seem to contribute to the ultraviolet divergencies . in a smooth background potential their corresponding cofficients",
    "are well known : @xmath37 the renormalized zero point energy can be defined as @xmath38 to keep the total energy of the system unchanged we add the subtracted object to the classical energy .",
    "then we have also a definition of a new classical energy @xmath39 the transition from @xmath40 to @xmath41 consists in the renormalization of the classical parameters contained in eq.(2 )",
    ". since the heat kernel coefficients are geometrical coefficients depending on the background ( and in our case containing powers of @xmath4 ) , to each classical parameter in the classical energy will correspond dimensionally a term in @xmath42 , then we renormalize the parameters as follows @xmath43 however in our particular case the @xmath44 and @xmath35 coefficients , corresponding respectively to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , will turn out to be zero , then only the last three parameters in ( 17 ) will undergo renormalization .",
    "these new parameters are to be inserted in the classical energy in ( 2 ) .",
    "the old classical parameters are infinite quantities ( i.e. unphysical ) because they do nt take into account the vacuum fluctuations . before applying this renormalization procedure",
    "we must note that the ground state energy proposed in ( 15 ) has not yet a unique meaning .",
    "for the uniqueness of @xmath45 we impose the renormalization condition @xmath46 which physically means that for a field of infinite mass we have no quantum fluctuations .",
    "we fulfil such requirement by subtracting all the contributions in @xmath47 proportional to positive or zero powers of the mass .",
    "that is we subtract also  fractionary , , terms up to the term resulting from the heat kernel coefficient @xmath48 .",
    "the remaining part , containing negative powers of @xmath3 , will go to zero for @xmath49 .",
    "+ this is our renormalizaton scheme , now we turn to the calculations .",
    "we use an approach appeared for the first time in @xcite . in the background of a spherical potential",
    "we have a radial schrdinger equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular momentum . in the general scattering theory with a continous spectrum @xmath8 we have the  regular solution , , @xcite defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the riccati bessel function .",
    "the asymptotics of the regular solution is expressed in terms of the jost function @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the riccati - hankel functions .",
    "now we examine the field at the boundary of our quantization volume .",
    "the potential has a compact support then , at the boundary , expression ( 21 ) becomes an exact equation , which can be considered as an equation for the eigenvalues @xmath57 .",
    "now taking for instance dirichlet boundary conditions : @xmath58 , we will have @xmath59 we see that eq.(22 ) is satisfied for @xmath60 , then we can write the sum in ( 4 ) as a contour integral using cauchy theorem @xmath61 where the contour @xmath62 encloses all the solutions of eq.(22 ) on the positive real @xmath8 axe and also the bound state solutions in the limit @xmath63 , which lie on the imaginary axes .",
    "we further simplfy eq.(23 ) by separating the contour in two pieces @xmath64 and @xmath65 and developing the hankel functions for large @xmath66 .",
    "then it is possible to recognize in the integrand a term @xmath67 which corresponds to the minkowski raum contribution .",
    "this term can be dropped .",
    "now we shift the two contours @xmath64 and @xmath65 to the imaginary axe and substitute @xmath68 , so that we get @xmath69^{1/2 -s }   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k } \\ln f_l(ik)\\ ] ] since at the end our quantization volume will go to infinity ( @xmath70 ) this equation will be independent from the boundary condition chosen for the quantization volume .",
    "eq.(24 ) is a very general and usefull representation of the ground state energy , where all the information about the background potential is contained in @xmath71 .",
    "+ in order to perform the substitution @xmath72 and the subtraction proposed in ( 15 ) we split eq.(24 ) in to two suitable parts , one of which is divercence free .",
    "we obtain this by adding and subtracting the leading uniform asymptotics of the integrand in eq .",
    "( 24 ) ( for more details on this procedure see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we define @xmath73 @xmath74^{1/2 -s }   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k } [ \\ln f_l(ik)- \\ln f^{as}_l(ik)]\\ ] ] and @xmath75^{1/2 -s }   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k }   \\ln f^{as}_l(ik)-e^{div}_{\\varphi } , \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the asymptotics of the modified jost function which we will take up the third order in @xmath77 .",
    "as the reader can check , the quantity @xmath78 introduced in ( 15 ) remains unalterated .",
    "+ now we need the modified jost function corresponding to our scattering problem , so we turn to study the potential .",
    "the initial field equation @xmath80 valid for @xmath81 can be divided into two parts : an equation for the free field @xmath82    and an equation for the field on the shell , which includes the required transparency conditions @xmath83    for the delta potential the regular solution is @xmath84 for the field inside and outside the radius @xmath4 . as above @xmath85 is the riccati - bessel function and @xmath86 are the riccati - hankel functions . combining eq.(30 ) with eq.(31 ) we get @xmath87 we solve for @xmath88 , keeping in mind that the wronskian determinant of @xmath89 is @xmath90 , then we find @xmath91 or @xmath92 and for the modified jost function we get @xmath93 which is in terms of the modified bessel functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "we need also the asymptotics of the jost function : @xmath97 , or more exactly the logarithmus of @xmath97 .",
    "the expansion of the product of the two bessel functions in ( 35 ) , for @xmath11 and @xmath98 equally large , is easily obtained with the help of @xcite .",
    "then we find the needed asymptotics as a sum of negative powers of @xmath98 with coefficients @xmath99 depending on @xmath16 .",
    "the asymptotics up to the third order reads @xmath100 here as above is @xmath96 and @xmath101 .",
    "now the ground state energy @xmath102 can be explicit calculated .",
    "+ let us first begin with an analytical simplification of @xmath103 .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath3 corresponds to the @xmath36 term of the heat kernel expansion ; although this term seems to generate no divergency it will be as well subtracted as mentioned in the second section of this paper , because of our initial renormalization condition .",

    "we have obtained an explicit expression for the renormalized ground state energy of a scalar massive field in the background of a semi - transparent shell .",
    "this expression is given by the sum of ( 49 ) and ( 51 ) and it depends only on the two parameters of the classical system , namely the radius and the magnitude of the potential of the spherical shell .",
    "the plots of @xmath148 as a function of the radius show that for repulsive potentials the renormalized ground state energy is positive only in some limited intervals of the radius and only when the potential is smaller than 1 . for a potential larger than 1",
    "the energy is always negative .",
    "this is the most striking conclusion of our work .",
    "for very large values of @xmath16 the shell should be no more transparent and the problem should formally become a dirichlet boundary condition problem .",
    "one could check this in the equation ( 35 ) for the jost function : here inserting a large @xmath16 the addend @xmath149 becomes negligible , then we would just have the product of the two modified bessel @xmath150 and @xmath151 functions ; such a jost function is exactly the one obtained in @xcite for a perfectly reflecting spherical shell ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) . in that paper",
    "the ground state energy is simply the sum of the energy inside and outside the shell .",
    "then formally we should have : @xmath152    now it is shown in @xcite that the  mirror , , configuration has always positive ground state energy for repulsive potentials .",
    "this fights with our plots which show an opposite sign .",
    "furthermore the @xmath48 coefficient in paper @xcite is zero . in our work",
    "@xmath48 remains a non zero coefficient also in the limit @xmath153 . + nevertheless for flat parallel boundaries the formal transition hypothized in the limit above is actually fulfilled as shown in paper @xcite . at least at the present stage of the investigation it is difficult to interpret these results .",
    "we must stress however that a perfectly reflecting boundary is not a realistic object and that a semi - tansparent sphere is a better physical model .",
