    "during the past few years , various numerical dynamical modelling techniques have been developed to construct accurate dynamical models for galaxies ( dejonghe  1989 ; emsellem , monet & bacon  1994 ; rix et al .",
    "1997 ; van der marel et al .  1998 ; gerhard et al .  1998 ; cretton et al .  1999 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; verolme & de zeeuw  2002 ) .",
    "the state - of - the - art techniques can handle various degrees of complexity such as the capability to include non - trivial geometries and higher - order kinematical information .",
    "nevertheless , analytical models remain interesting and important for various reasons .",
    "they can provide a simple testbed where various physical processes can be investigated , or where new modelling or data analysis techniques can be explored .",
    "analytical models are particularly useful to generate the initial conditions for n - body , sph or monte carlo simulations .",
    "most attention has been devoted to the construction of spherical selfconsistent models , i.e.  models in which the stars move in a potential generated completely by the stars themselves .",
    "famous examples include the plummer model ( plummer  1911 ; dejonghe  1987 ) , the isochrone sphere  ( hnon  1959 , 1960 ) and the jaffe sphere ( jaffe  1983 ) and the hernquist model ( hernquist  1990 ; baes & dejonghe  2002 ) . such models often serve as a template model for elliptical galaxies , globular clusters or the bulges of spiral galaxies .",
    "recent observational evidence indicates , however , that the central regions of these stellar systems can not always be faithfully represented by selfconsistent models .",
    "the existence of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies has been suspected for a long time , as accretion onto massive compact objects was regarded as the only reasonable explanation for the existence of active galaxies and quasars ( salpeter  1964 ; sotan  1982 ) . during the last decade",
    ", quiescent supermassive black holes have been detected in the centre of the milky way ( ghez et al .",
    "2000 ; schdel et al .  2002 ) and in the nuclei of virtually all external galaxies which are nearby enough to resolve the sphere of influence of the black hole ( e.g.  see list in tremaine et al .",
    "the masses of these black holes are roughly between a million and a few billion solar masses and are tightly coupled to structural parameters of the host galaxies ( kormendy & richstone  1995 ; ferrarese & merritt  2000 ; gebhardt et al .  2000b ; graham et al .",
    "2001 ; mclure & dunlop  2002 ; ferrarese  2002 ; baes et al .  2003 ; marconi & hunt  2003 ) .",
    "recently , evidence for the presence of intermediate mass black holes in the centre of globular clusters has been reported ( gebhardt , rich & ho  2002 ; gerssen et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , although this evidence is still controversial ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2003a , b ; mcnamara , harrison & anderson  2003 ) .",
    "these observations clearly indicate that there is a need for simple but realistic analytical dynamical models with a central black hole .",
    "the first requirement for the construction of models with a black hole is a potential - density pair with a cuspy central density profile .",
    "tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) demonstrate that spherical isotropic systems need a central density profile that diverges at least as @xmath0 to be able to support a central black hole .",
    "the need for such cuspy models also follows from observations : hst photometry has shown that ellipticals and the bulges of spiral galaxies generally have central density cusps that diverge as @xmath1 at small radii with @xmath2 ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "1996 ; ravindranath et al .",
    "2002 ; seigar et al .  2002 ) .",
    "also for the milky way there is evidence for a central density cusp in the innermost regions ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) . a very useful one - parameter family of spherical models with this characteristic , which we refer to as the @xmath3-models , was introduced independently by dehnen  ( 1993 ) and tremaine et al .",
    "this family has a simple analytical density profile which diverges as @xmath1 in the central regions @xmath4 , and includes the hernquist and jaffe models as special cases .",
    "zhao  ( 1996 ) generalized this family further to a very general three - parameter family of models , the so - called @xmath5-models .",
    "for many of these models , interesting dynamical properties such as the intrinsic and projected velocity dispersions , the distribution function and the differential energy distribution can be calculated analytically if one assumes an isotropic selfconsistent dynamical structure .",
    "the second step in the construction of dynamical models with a cuspy core is to add to the potential of the selfconsistent model an extra contribution from the black hole , and re - calculate the dynamical properties with this new potential .",
    "the calculation of the ( intrinsic and/or projected ) velocity dispersions in the presence of a black hole is not very difficult , and can usually be performed analytically for those models where the dispersions can be calculated analytically in the selfconsistent case . for example , for the sets of potential - density pairs considered by tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and zhao  ( 1996 ) , the addition of a black hole was not a problem for the calculation of the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "the reason is that the intrinsic and projected velocity dispersions are just linear functions of the potential , and therefore linear functions of the black hole mass .",
    "many other interesting kinematical properties , in particular the phase space distribution function , depend on the potential in a strongly non - linear way , however .",
    "the construction of dynamical models in which these more complicated kinematical quantities can be expressed analytically in the presence of a black hole proves to be more difficult .",
    "apart from the asymptotic behaviour , these characteristics usually need to be calculated numerically ( tremaine et al .",
    "1994 ; dejonghe et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the work by ciotti  ( 1996 ) provides a first attempt to construct completely analytical dynamical models for galaxies with a central black hole . in an effort to construct realistic dynamical models for elliptical galaxies embedded in massive cuspy dark matter haloes",
    ", he considers a set of two - component hernquist models .",
    "they consist of a stellar component and a halo component , both of which are modelled as a hernquist profile , but with different masses and core radii .",
    "the interesting aspect of his work for our goal is that the masses and core radii of each component can be taken arbitrarily . setting the core radius of the halo component to zero",
    ", his two - component model degenerates into a hernquist model with a central black hole .",
    "ciotti demonstrates that the distribution function and differential energy distribution of hernquist models with a central black hole can be expressed analytically , albeit as rather cumbersome expressions .",
    "for example , the distribution function can be written as the derivative of a complicated function involving incomplete elliptic integrals and jacobian functions .",
    "nevertheless , his work presents the first model for galaxies with a central black hole where most of the kinematical properties can be calculated analytically .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed kinematical analysis of a family of spherical models for elliptical galaxies and bulges consisting of a stellar component and a central black hole . in section  2",
    "we define our family of models .",
    "all models in this one - parameter family share the same stellar density profile , which corresponds to one of @xmath3-models introduced by dehnen  ( 1993 ) and tremaine et al .",
    "the potential of the models is a linear combination of the potential generated by the stars and the potential of a central black hole .",
    "the importance of both components to the total potential can be set arbitrarily by varying the parameter @xmath6 , which represents the mass of the central black hole relative to the total mass .",
    "the reason why we chose this particular family of models is that most of the interesting kinematical properties can be expressed completely analytically for all values of @xmath6 . in section  3",
    "we describe some intrinsic kinematical properties of this family of models , such as the distribution function , the differential energy distribution and the moments of the distribution function .",
    "in particular , we give closed analytical expressions for these quantities , completely in terms of elementary functions . in section  4",
    "we describe some observed kinematical properties as they are projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "most of these quantities can be expressed analytically involving simple incomplete elliptic integrals . in section  5",
    "we present a number of generalizations to models with a anisotropic orbital structure .",
    "in particular , we discuss models with a constant anisotropy profile , models with a distribution function of the osipkov - merritt type and models with a completely radial orbital structure . also for these models",
    ", the distribution function and its moments can be calculated completely analytically for all values of the central black hole mass .",
    "finally , a discussion is given in section  5 .",
    "the starting point for our family of models is the stellar luminosity density profile @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total stellar luminosity of the system and @xmath9 is a scale length .",
    "the ( positive ) potential generated by this stellar distribution is easily found through poisson s equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total stellar mass .",
    "the isotropic selfconsistent model with this potential - density pair is a particular case from the family of @xmath3-models considered by dehnen  ( 1993 ) and tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , corresponding to @xmath12 or @xmath13 . a number of kinematical properties for this selfconsistent model , such as the velocity dispersion and distribution function has been derived in these papers .",
    "our aim is to consider systems consisting of two components : a stellar component and a central supermassive black hole . in order to find the total potential of such a two - component system",
    ", we need to add to the stellar potential an extra contribution from the black hole .",
    "we model the central black hole as a point potential with mass @xmath14 , such that we obtain @xmath15 in the remainder of this paper , we will work in dimensionless units : we set the gravitational constant @xmath16 , the scalelength @xmath9 , the luminosity @xmath8 and the _ total _ mass @xmath17 of the model equal to unity .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath6 as the fraction of the black hole mass to the total mass of the galaxy . with these conventions ,",
    "we can write the potential - density pair of our model as @xmath18 in this paper , we consider isotropic kinematical models implied by the potential - density pair formed by equations  ( [ density ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "this potential - density pair defines a one - parameter family of isotropic dynamical models , where @xmath6 is a free parameter that can assume any value between 0 and 1 .",
    "the models corresponding to these values of @xmath6 have a particular meaning : the former corresponds to a selfconsistent model without a central black hole , whereas the latter represents a galaxy with a central black hole and a negligible stellar mass - to - light ratio .    as an important remark",
    ", the reader should note that the convention we use is different from the convention used in e.g.  tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and zhao  ( 1996 ) . in these papers",
    ", @xmath6 denotes the black hole mass relative to the _ stellar _ mass , and the normalization is such that the stellar mass is set to unity .",
    "we prefer to set the _ total _ mass of the galaxy equal to unity however , because ( 1 )  all models then have the same behaviour at large radii and ( 2 )  this allows us to study the entire range of models from selfconsistent models without black hole to models completely dominated by the black hole potential .",
    "the total mass density , circular velocity curve and the cumulative mass function are readily obtained @xmath19 the isotropic velocity dispersion @xmath20 can be obtained from the solution of the jeans equation , @xmath21 the cumulative mass function , which depends linearly on the black hole mass , is the only @xmath6-dependent quantity in this expression .",
    "consequently we can write the velocity dispersion as the sum of separate contributions from the stellar mass and the black hole .",
    "the result is @xmath22      \\nonumber \\\\      & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad      + \\frac{2\\mu}{35 }      \\left(\\frac{1+r}{r}\\right )          \\left (      5 - 8r+16r^2 - 64r^3 - 128r^4          + 128r^{7/2}\\sqrt{1+r }      \\right ) .",

    "the ultimate goal of the dynamical modeller is to obtain an expression for the phase space distribution function @xmath26 , which contains all kinematical information on a system . for non - rotating isotropic",
    "spherically symmetric systems , the phase space distribution function depends on the position and velocity vectors only through the binding energy @xmath27 , which is a integral of motion .",
    "the distribution function @xmath28 is thus a one - dimensional rather than a six - dimensional function .",
    "the key to calculate the distribution function corresponding to a given potential - density pair is the augmented density @xmath29 , i.e.  the density written in terms of the potential . with this function",

    ", there is obviously no effect from the black hole , whereas a black hole changes the slope of the projected dispersion profile at small projected radii from @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "the models in the family we have described all have an isotropic dynamical structure , and consequently a distribution function @xmath67 that depends only on the binding energy .",
    "general anisotropic distribution function in spherically symmetric systems have distribution functions that depend on two integrals of motion , usually the binding energy and the modulus @xmath126 of the angular momentum vector .",
    "the construction of general anisotropic dynamical models @xmath127 that correspond to a given spherical potential - density pair is discussed in detail by dejonghe  ( 1986 ) . also for anisotropic models , the key ingredient for the calculation of the distribution function and its moments is an augmented density . for anisotropic models ,",
    "the augmented density is an explicit function of both radius and potential , i.e. a function @xmath128 .",
    "for each potential - density pair , infinitely many of these augmented density functions and thus anisotropic dynamical models can be constructed .",
    "the only requirements are that the condition @xmath129 is satisfied and that the corresponding distribution function is non - negative over the entire phase space .",
    "unfortunately the formulae to calculate the distribution function and its moments from the augmented density are significantly more complicated than the eddington formula  ( [ eddington ] ) in the isotropic case .",
    "a number of different approaches exist , including for example an approach with combined laplace - mellin transforms .",
    "there are a number of special cases , however , for which the construction of anisotropic dynamical models is not much more demanding than the construction of isotropic models .",
    "this has been illustrated by baes & dejonghe  ( 2002 ) , who constructed three different families of analytical dynamical models for the selfconsistent hernquist potential - density pair , with widely different dynamical structure . in this section",
    "we shortly describe how our family of isotropic dynamical models with a central black hole can be generalized to models with a constant anisotropy , models with an osipkov - merritt type distribution function and models with a completely radial orbital structure .",
    "further generalizations , such as cuddeford  ( 1991 ) models , are also possible .",
    "a special family of dynamical models corresponds to models with a augmented density @xmath128 that is a power law of @xmath130 , @xmath131 where @xmath132 and where the function @xmath133 is determined by the condition  ( [ vwani ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that augmented densities of the form  ( [ constani ] ) correspond to models with a constant anisotropy ( dejonghe  1986 ; binney & tremaine  1987 ) . the distribution function is a power law of the angular momentum , and can be found through an eddington - like formula @xmath134 to calculate the distribution function for the model defined by the potential - density pair ( [ density])-([potential ] ) , we can transform equation  ( [ dfca ] ) to an integration with respect to @xmath52 in the same way as in section  [ df.sec ] .",
    "we directly obtain @xmath135 if @xmath136 is a half - integer number , the integrand in formula  ( [ dfca ] ) is a rational function of @xmath52 , and if @xmath136 is an integer number , the integrand is the product of a rational function and a square root of a quadratic term in @xmath52 .",
    "the distribution functions can consequently be written in terms of elementary functions only for all integer and half - integer values of @xmath136 .",
    "the radial and tangential velocity dispersions can be found through a formula similar to equation  ( [ jeans ] ) @xmath137 these expressions can also be written in terms of elementary functions for all integer and half - integer values of @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , analytical expressions can be derived for all higher - order moments if @xmath136 is an integer or half - integer number .",
    "osipkov  ( 1979 ) and merritt  ( 1985 ) developed an inversion technique for another special class of spherical anisotropic dynamical models , namely models where the distribution function depends on energy and angular momentum only through the combination @xmath138 , with @xmath139 the so - called anisotropy radius and under the assumption that @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "such models are characterized by an augmented density of the form @xmath142 where the function @xmath143 is determined by the condition  ( [ vwani ] ) .",
    "the osipkov - merritt models have an anisotropy profile of the form @xmath144 , i.e. they are isotropic in the centre and become completely radially anisotropic at large radii . for the calculation of distribution functions for osipkov - merritt models , one can use a formula very similar to the eddington formula , @xmath145 for the model we consider , we obtain @xmath146 the distribution function of the osipkov - merritt models can be calculated in a very similar way as the distribution function of the isotropic models .",
    "we find after some algebra @xmath147,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 represents the isotropic distribution function  ( [ fbh ] ) and @xmath149 is a polynomial with integer coefficients @xmath150 the velocity dispersions for the osipkov - merritt models can be found through the formula @xmath151 this integral can easily be evaluated analytically , and also the higher - order moments of the distribution function can be expressed completely in terms of elementary functions for all values of @xmath139 and @xmath6 .",
    "it deserves some special attention that the distribution function of both the models with constant anisotropy and the osipkov - merritt models corresponding to our potential - density pair ( [ density])-([potential ] ) are positive for all values of @xmath136 and @xmath139 and for all values of the relative black hole mass @xmath6 .",
    "this is quite unusual . in the limit @xmath152 or @xmath153 for the osipkov - merritt and constant anisotropy models respectively , the entire galaxy is populated with only radial orbits .",
    "not all density profiles can sustain such a model : richstone & tremaine  ( 1984 ) demonstrated that the density must diverge at least as @xmath154 at small radii in order to be able to sustain a purely radial orbital structure . models with constant density cores or density cusps shallower than @xmath154 will hence have a minimal anisotropy radius @xmath155 below which osipkov - merritt models are negative at some point in phase space , and a maximum anisotropy value @xmath156 above which the constant anisotropy models become negative at some point in phase space .",
    "for example , selfconsistent plummer models have @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( merritt  1985 ) , and selfconsistent hernquist models have @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( baes & dejonghe  2002 ) .",
    "the central slope of the density  ( [ density ] ) for the models we consider in this paper is steep enough such that even models with a purely radial orbital structure are positive over the entire phase space .    for models with a completely radial orbital structure",
    ", the augmented density can be written as @xmath161 where the function @xmath162 is determined by the condition  ( [ vwani ] ) .",
    "the distribution function is of course a degenerate function of angular momentum ( only orbits with @xmath163 are populated ) , and can be calculated via the eddington - like formula @xmath164 once again , a closed expression can be obtained for the family of potential - density pairs we have discussed in this paper by transforming the integral to an integration with respect to the variable @xmath52 .",
    "one obtains after some algebra @xmath165,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this distribution function is everywhere positive , for all values of the black hole mass @xmath6 .",
    "the tangential velocity dispersions for these models are of course identically zero , whereas the radial velocity dispersion can be found through equation  ( [ cvd ] ) , @xmath166",
    "we have described a one - parameter family of spherical models for elliptical galaxies and bulges consisting of a stellar component and a central black hole . all models in this family",
    "share the same stellar density profile , which has a steep cusp with a slope of @xmath167 in the centre .",
    "the gravitational potential for the models is a linear combination of the potential generated selfconsistently by the stars and the potential of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 , representing the mass of the black hole relative to the total mass of the galaxy , can assume any value between 0 and 1 .",
    "the family therefore contains models ranging from a selfconsistent model without black hole to a model where the potential is entirely dominated by the black hole .",
    "we have done an extensive study of the internal and projected kinematics for this family of models . with the assumption of isotropy",
    ", we have calculated the intrinsic velocity dispersions , the distribution function , the differential energy distribution , the moments of the distribution function , the surface brightness and the projected velocity dispersions .",
    "all of these quantities have been expressed completely analytically , for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "we have also described some extensions of the models to anisotropic orbital structures . in particular ,",
    "we have considered models with a constant anisotropy , models with distribution functions of the osipkov - merritt type and models with a completely radial orbital structure . also for these families of models , the distribution function and its moments can be calculated completely analytically for all values of the central black hole mass @xmath6 .",
    "we are well aware that the stellar component we have considered does not completely represent the detailed structure of the centre of galaxies .",
    "firstly , it has a fairly steep density cusp , which is at the edge of the observed range in real elliptical galaxies ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "with such a steep cusp , much of the stellar mass is very centrally concentrated , resulting in an infinitely deep stellar potential well .",
    "the addition of a black hole potential to this stellar potential does not drastically change the global mass distribution , such that the effects of a black hole on the kinematical properties are probably quite conservative . for example , the distribution function is substantially , but not very drastically affected by the presence of a black hole , whereas this effect is much stronger for @xmath3-models with a less steep density cusp ( see figure  6 in tremaine et al .",
    "the reason why we focused on the density profile  ( [ density ] ) , and not on one of the other members of the family of @xmath3-models with a shallower central density cusp for example , is that the @xmath12 model is unique in the way that it allows a relatively simple expression of the augmented density in the presence of a central black hole .",
    "it is the only member of the family of @xmath3-models where the distribution function , the differential energy distribution and the moments can completely be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "we are currently undertaking a more general study of the properties of the @xmath3-models with a central black hole , using both analytical and numerical means ( baes , buyle & dejonghe  2004 ) .",
    "secondly , the models presented here are spherically symmetric and isotropic , whereas few elliptical galaxies are thought to be perfectly spherical .",
    "observational studies suggest that a substantial fraction of elliptical galaxies are at least moderately triaxial ( franx , van gorkum & de zeeuw  1991 ; tremblay & merritt  1995 ; bak & statler  2000 ) .",
    "the central regions of galaxies with a central black hole are generally believed to be roughly axisymmetric , however . indeed",
    ", supermassive black holes drive the shape of galaxies in a triaxial haloes toward axisymmetry by stochastic diffusion , either globally ( gerhard  & binney  1985 ; norman , may & van albada  1985 ; merritt & quinlan  1997 ; wachlin & ferratt - mello  1998 ; valluri & merritt  1998 ) , or at least the central regions ( holley - bockelmann et al .  2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "still , axisymmetric systems have a much larger freedom in orbital structure than spherical systems . using detailed axisymmetric dynamical modelling , gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the central regions of the massive early - type galaxies generally have a significant tangential anisotropy , whereas less massive galaxies have a range of anisotropies .",
    "in spite of these critical notes , the family of dynamical models presented in this paper has the huge advantage over more complicated numerical models that all kinematical properties can be calculated completely in terms of elementary functions , for any value of the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this is not only the case for rather simple kinematical properties such as the velocity dispersions , but also for more complicated kinematical properties which depend in a strongly non - linear way on the potential . in particular , the distribution function and the differential energy distribution can be written in a compact form and in terms of elementary functions only . as a result , this family of models is useful for a large set of applications . in particular ,",
    "it can be used to easily generate the initial conditions for n - body or hydrodynamical simulations , which are needed to investigate how black holes interact with the stellar , gaseous and dark matter components of their host galaxies .",
