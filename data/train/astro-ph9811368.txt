    "the idea of cosmic crystallography was introduced by lehoucq et al .",
    "@xcite , and applied by them to several einstein - de sitter ( eds ) models with closed ( i. e. , compact and boundless ) spatial sections of euclidean geometry and nontrivial topology .",
    "the simplest of these cases has the three - torus @xmath0 as spatial section - model e1 in lachize - rey and luminet @xcite review article on cosmic topology .",
    "this model provides the sharpest example of the crystallographic effect of the topology : if @xmath1 is based on a cube of side @xmath2 as fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) then the distances between images of a single source are in the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 integers , so that a plot of the distribution of distances @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 provides neat peaks in the integral values @xmath7 in the other five eds models with closed spatial sections the peaks tend to be in smaller numbers or less sharp , because the distances between some of the images of a single source depend on the latter s position inside the fp .",
    "this is characteristic of locally but not globally homogeneous models @xcite , and can be seen in the study of model e4 by fagundes and gausmann @xcite : when @xmath8 mpc is of the order of magnitude of the observable universe s radius , no peaks showed up in the distribution @xmath9 these studies are based on computer simulated catalogs , and can not yet be compared with real catalogs , given the present limitations of the latter .",
    "the same absence of obvious peaks is true for a model with a closed hyperbolic manifold @xmath10 as spatial section , and hence the metric of friedmann s open model .",
    "this is illustrated  in figs . 1 and 2 , with @xmath10 the second of best s @xcite three manifolds with an icosahedron as fp , and",
    "listed as number @xmath11 in the census of closed , orientable hyperbolic manifolds in weeks s computer program snappea 2.5.3 @xcite .",
    "the figure shows plots of @xmath5 against the distances in megaparsecs , assuming the density parameter @xmath12 and hubble s constant @xmath13 km sec@xmath14mpc@xmath15 and a radius of @xmath16  mpc , equivalent to maximum redshift @xmath17 which we take to be the position of the surface of last scattering ( sls ) of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the plots for the distributions for the compact model and the infinite model , respectively .",
    "although there is more wiggling in the former , the general shape is the same for both .",
    "so we tried a further step in the crystallography method , which is to map the _ differences _ between the distributions for the compact and infinite cases .    in sec .",
    "2 we explain our method and present the results , and in sec .",
    "3 the latter are discussed .",
    "to fix our notation let the metric of the hyperbolic friedmann model be written as    @xmath18.\\ ] ]    to simulate a random distribution of sources in the fp , we first looked for such a distribution in the ball enclosed by the icosahedron s circumscribing sphere , with radius @xmath19 this was done by dividing the ball into 13 shells of thickness @xmath20 with volume @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the medium radius of the shell ; and also dividing the solid angle space into ten zones , with @xmath23 in each zone , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 the zone s medium value of @xmath26 then a number ( @xmath27 ) of pseudorandom positions in the ball were chosen by computer , with the condition that the occupations in each shell and zone were proportional to @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "finally a program routine excluded from the obtained points those that were outside the icosahedron .",
    "the @xmath30 remaining ones were considered the positions of the sources in the fp .",
    "the radius of the sls in normalized units is @xmath31 for the assumed values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in order to fill this space without gaps we needed @xmath34 copies of the icosahedron , besides the fp itself .",
    "they were produced by the @xmath35 face - pairing generators @xmath36 ( one - letter words ) of the covering group @xmath37 , @xmath38 two - letter , and @xmath39three - letter words in the@xmath40 s .",
    "this set of icosahedra cover hyperbolic space up to a radius @xmath41 , slightly larger than @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath34 operators were then applied to each of the @xmath30 sources , the result being accepted as an image if it lay inside the sls ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the total of potential images ( they are potential in the sense that , because of evolution and other factors , many of them may not be observable ) thus obtained , including the sources , was @xmath44",
    ".    then we looked for the present ( or comoving ) distances between each pair of these images , by multiplying the normalized distances by the curvature radius of the universe ( see , for example , @xcite ) , @xmath45 mpc .",
    "a list was prepared by grouping the numbers of occurrence of distances in bins of @xmath46 mpc width .",
    "the corresponding plot is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "we proceeded to obtain a similar distribution in friedmann s open model , with the same parameters as above , but with the same number of pseudorandom sources as there are images , i. e. , @xmath44 sources .",
    "a list similar to the one above mentioned was plotted in fig .",
    "2 . as indicated in the introduction , we could not see a significant difference between these plots .",
    "finally we subtracted the values of the second list from those of the first .",
    "3 is a plot of these differences .",
    "one notices wild oscillations in the scale of the bin width , modulated by a broad pattern , on the scale of @xmath47 we fitted this plot with a five - term fourier series of the form    @xmath48 where @xmath49 nearest integer to @xmath50 mpc ) , @xmath51 258 , and \\{@xmath52 } = \\{96.6 , 134.4 , -211.7 , 127.0 , -89.4}.",
    "a _ clifford translation _ of a metric space @xmath53 is an isometry @xmath54 of @xmath55 such that _ _ distance__@xmath56 is independent of point @xmath57 .",
    "wolf @xcite . in a recent paper , gomero et al .",
    "@xcite link the existence of sharp peaks in cosmic crystallography to that of elements of @xmath58 which are clifford translations of the universal covering space of @xmath59 .",
    "( see also lehoucq et al .",
    "@xcite . ) but in fig . 1 of @xcite we see a significant peak that may not be produced by a clifford translation .",
    "the matter deserves further investigation .    in the case of the hyperbolic space @xmath11 treated here",
    ", there seems indeed to be no sharp peaks , as predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( it should be interesting to look for them in the case of a highly symmetrical manifold , like the hyperbolic dodecahedron space @xcite . )",
    "this is why we proceeded to look for the differences in the distribution of distances between this model and friedmann s open model , whose plot does show a significant pattern .    of course we would not expect to be able to infer the correct cosmic topology from a single plot , even one with sharp peaks .",
    "the topology of the universe will probably be revealed slowly and progressively , as more and better data are obtained , and several topology searching methods are applied to them .",
