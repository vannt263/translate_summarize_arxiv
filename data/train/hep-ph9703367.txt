    "the central problem of light hadron spectroscopy has been the problem of the scalar @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "it is well known that these states possess peculiar properties from the naive quark ( @xmath14 ) model point of view , see , for example , the reviews . to clarify the nature of these mesons a number of models has been suggested .",
    "it was shown that all their challenging properties could be understood @xcite in the framework of the four - quark ( @xmath15 ) mit - bag model @xcite , with symbolic quark structure @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "along with the @xmath15 nature of @xmath13 and @xmath12 mesons the possibility of their being the @xmath10 molecule is discussed @xcite .    during the last few years",
    "it was established @xcite that the radiative decays of the @xmath18 meson @xmath19 and @xmath20 could be a good guideline in distinguishing the @xmath2 and @xmath1 meson models .",
    "the branching ratios are considerably different in the cases of naive quark , four - quark or molecular models .",
    "as has been shown @xcite , in the four quark model the branching ratio is @xmath21 and in the @xmath10 molecule model it is @xmath22    currently also an interest in an old interpretation of the @xmath2 meson being an @xmath11 state , see , @xcite is rekindled , despite the fact that the almost ideal mass degeneracy of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons is difficult to understand in this case . by adding the quark - gluon transitions @xmath23 one does not manage this problem .",
    "the experiment points rather to the fact that the @xmath2 meson is weakly coupled with gluons .",
    "really , according qcd @xcite we have @xmath24 but from experiment @xcite @xmath25 and @xcite @xmath26    hence , if one considers that the @xmath27 coupling with gluons is essential , then the @xmath12 coupling with the gluons should be considered as rather weak .    in spite of this fact",
    ", the @xmath11 scenario is discussed in the current literature as one possible model of the @xmath2 meson structure .",
    "the `` accidental '' mass degeneracy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in this case is assigned to the final state interaction .",
    "it is easy to note that in the case of an @xmath11 structure of the @xmath2 meson @xmath28 and @xmath29 are different by factor of ten , wich should be visible experimentally .",
    "really , the @xmath1 meson as an isovector state has a symbolic structure @xmath30 in the two - quark model . in this case",
    "the decay @xmath31 is suppressed by the ozi rule and the rough estimation for the real part of the decay amplitude gives @xcite @xmath32 .    by virtue of the real two - particle @xmath33 intermediate state",
    "the ozi rule breaking imaginary part of the decay amplitude is relatively high and gives @xcite @xmath34    in the case when @xmath35 the suppression by the ozi rule is absent and the evaluation gives @xcite @xmath36 let us note that in the case of the @xmath37 decay allowed by the ozi rule one expects @xmath38 .",
    "so , the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 are of special interest for both theorists and the experimentalists .    at the present time",
    "the investigation of the @xmath39 decay has started with the detector cmd-2 @xcite at the @xmath40-collider vepp-2 m in novosibirsk . besides that , in novosibirsk at the same collider the detector snd has started @xcite and has been working with @xmath41 and @xmath42 decays .",
    "the modernization of the vepp-2 m complex is planed to increase the luminosity by one order of magnitude @xcite . and , finally , in the near future in frascati the start of the operation of the @xmath18-factory da@xmath43ne is expected @xcite , which should make possible extensive studies of the scalar @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that the search for the @xmath2 meson in the reaction @xmath44 is not an easy task because of the large initial state radiation background . in this paper",
    "we study the reactions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    in the second part of the paper , imposing the appropriate photon energy cuts @xmath47 mev",
    ", we show that the background reactions @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are negligible up to @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that it will be experimentally possible to isolate photons from @xmath52 and @xmath53 with energies @xmath47 mev , despite the background of the other photons from decays of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this cut plays a strong role in suppression of background , see sec.ii below .    in the third part , basing on a two - channel analysis of the @xmath8 scattering the predictions on @xmath56 are made .",
    "we discuss the four - quark model of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons , the model of the @xmath10 molecules and the model of the @xmath2 meson being the @xmath11 state as well .",
    "the fourth part is devoted to discussions of the obtained results .",
    "let us consider the background to the @xmath57 reaction . in the vector meson dominance model",
    "the diagrams are pictured in fig.1 .",
    "let us estimate the cross section of the @xmath58 process , shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "first of all , notice that @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the invariant mass of the @xmath62 system .",
    "the limits of the integration are taken with regard to the photon energy cuts @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath65 takes into account the interference of the identical pions , see appendix .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath66 process @xmath67 where @xmath68 is defined in eq.([elwidth ] ) and @xmath69^{3/2}\\ ] ] the coupling constant @xmath70 is taken from the width of the decay @xmath71 data that leads to @xmath72 @xmath73 . in the propagator @xmath74 we are taking into account the energy dependence of the @xmath75 meson width @xmath76    the constant @xmath77",
    "is taken from the condition @xmath78 nb , see @xcite , that leads to @xmath79 .    from the above , the cross section @xmath80 nb",
    "the cross section of the @xmath58 process is @xmath81 in the region of interest @xmath82 mev .",
    "analogously let us consider the @xmath83 process , see fig.1(b ) .",
    "first , we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 the cross section of the @xmath86 process is @xmath87    the constant @xmath88 is found from the condition @xmath89 nb , see @xcite , that leads to @xmath90 . in view of it",
    "the cross section @xmath91 nb . for the cross section of the @xmath92 process in the photon energy region @xmath93 , see ( [ fullomega ] ) , one has @xmath94",
    "the cross section of the @xmath95 process , see fig.1(c ) , in the @xmath18 meson region at @xmath82 mev is @xmath96 where @xmath97 .. ]    in principle , the interference between the amplitudes @xmath98 may be essential , but , as it is seen from eq.([rho ] ) , eq.([omega ] ) and eq.([fullphi ] ) , in studies of the background to the @xmath99 reaction one can neglect the contributions of the @xmath100 processes and the question of their interference no longer arises .",
    "hence , taking into account that @xmath101 , the background processes @xmath102 are negligible compared to the one under study @xmath99 up to @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite . ]    as for the interference between the primary process @xmath99 and the background process @xmath104 , one can neglect it also due to the fact that 66% of background contribution to the branching ratio under consideration is determined by the region @xmath105 mev while the contribution of the primary process in this region is less than 20% in the worst case when the @xmath2 meson is relatively wide , see sec.iv .",
    "let us consider the background to the @xmath106 reaction .",
    "it is easy to show that in this case , as in the case of the reaction @xmath99 , the process @xmath107 is dominant .",
    "the cross sections of the processes @xmath108 , see fig.2 , are by two orders of magnitude less then the cross sections of the processes @xmath109",
    ". the cross sections of the processes @xmath49 , in turn , are by two orders of magnitude less then the cross section of the process @xmath107 . in comparison with the process",
    "@xmath107 the cross section of the process @xmath110 is suppressed by two orders of magnitude also .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath107 @xmath111 let us take into account that @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath61 is the invariant mass of the @xmath114 system .",
    "the integration limits are taken with regard to the photon energy cuts @xmath115 and @xmath116 gev .",
    "taking into account that @xmath117 nb , for the cross section of the process @xmath118 in the region @xmath47 mev one gets @xmath119 wich corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "so , the processes @xmath121 and @xmath122 which are the background to @xmath123 are negligible for @xmath124 greater than @xmath125 .",
    "as for the interference between the @xmath123 and @xmath107 processes , one can neglect it also due to the fact that 80% of background contribution to the branching ratio under consideration is determined by the region @xmath105 mev while the contribution of the primary process in this region is less than 20% in the worst case when the @xmath1 meson is relatively wide , see sec.iv .",
    "notice that if it should be possible to choose a cut on photon energy @xmath126 mev the background would be one order of magnitude less than previously stated while the primary processes @xmath5 would not decrease considerably .",
    "the background from processes @xmath127 described above are negligible up to @xmath128 . in the meantime",
    "the one - loop calculation in the frame of the chiral perturbation theory of @xmath129 at @xmath47 mev leads to the number of @xmath125 order of magnitude , see @xcite .",
    "so , in such a theory the strong interference effects with the reaction @xmath130 are predicted .",
    "but one can not restrict oneself to the one - loop approximation only in the region discussed ( @xmath131 gev ) , see , for example , @xcite . in view of the fact that all the corrections to the amplitude in the chiral model can not be taken into account",
    ", we treat them in the phenomenological way considering the scalar particle called @xmath132 meson that is strongly coupled with @xmath8 channel and , in view of mixing with @xmath2 meson , can change considerably the photon energy differential cross section .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath132 meson we obtain from fitting the @xmath8 scattering data .",
    "we consider the one loop mechanism of the @xmath134 meson production , where @xmath135 , through the charged kaon loop , @xmath136 , see .",
    "the symbolic diagram is shown in fig.3(a ) . the amplitude @xmath137 in the rest frame of the the @xmath18 meson is parametrized in the following manner @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the invariant mass of the @xmath8 system , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the polarization vectors of the @xmath18 meson and photon respectively .",
    "the expression of the @xmath142 function obtained in the four - quark @xmath143 model is written down in @xcite .. ) .",
    "please , compare with @xcite ]      taking into account the mixing of the @xmath2 and @xmath132 mesons , the amplitude of the reaction @xmath144 is written in the following way @xcite @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 at @xmath148 and @xmath149 is the phase of the elastic background , see ( [ amplppkk ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath150 is related to the electron width of the vector meson decay @xmath151    for the differential cross section one gets @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the energy of the photon , @xmath154 is the cut on @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the angle between the photon momentum direction and the beam in the center of mass frame of the considered reaction : @xmath157 .",

    "the electron vacuum polarization to the one order of @xmath162 is @xmath163 the contribution of the muon and light hadron has been omitted . describing the photon spectrum",
    ", we shall use the photon energy cuts @xmath164 mev that allows the separation of the signal from the other states contributing in the differential cross section .",
    "but , calculating the branching ratios of the processes , we shall neglect the @xmath160 , as it was done above , and use the photon energy cut @xmath47 mev .      for the propagator of the scalar particle we use the following expression @xmath166,\\ ] ] where @xmath167=\\pi_r(m)= \\pi_{rr}(m)$ ] takes into account the finite width corrections of the resonance which are the one loop contribution to the self - energy of the @xmath134 resonance from the two - particle intermediate @xmath168 states . in the @xmath15 model of the scalar particle and in the model of the @xmath10 molecule the @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons",
    "are strongly coupled with the @xmath10 channel , since they are just under the threshold of this channel .",
    "the ordinary resonance expression of the propagator , in view of this coupling , is changed considerably and the account of @xmath167 $ ] corrections is necessary , see @xcite .",
    "notice that the expression ( [ signal ] ) for mixing of the @xmath2 and @xmath132 mesons takes into account the all order of the perturbation theory , the symbolic diagrams are shown in fig.3 .",
    "nondiagonal elements of the matrix @xmath176 are the transitions caused by the resonance mixing due to the final state interaction which occurred in the same decay channels @xmath177 .",
    "we write them down in the following manner @xcite @xmath178 where the constants @xmath179 take into account effectively the contribution of @xmath180 and other intermediate states and incorporate the subtraction constants for the @xmath181 transitions . in the four - quark and two - quark models we treat these constants as a free parameters .",
    "really , the width of the weakly bound , quasi - stable system can not be larger than the bound energy which is @xmath182 mev for the @xmath10 mesons , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "so , in the molecular model the effective width of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons is @xmath183 mev .",
    "the @xmath8 scattering data , as we shall see below , permit the width of the @xmath2 meson to be @xmath184 gev .",
    "such widths , with some stretch of the interpretation can be associated with the @xmath10 bound state .",
    "but , nevertheless , we suppose that the latest experimental data are difficult ( apparently impossible ) to understand in the framework of this model as they point to the rather wide @xmath2 resonance with the @xmath185 mev , see .",
    "the objections against the @xmath10 bound state interpretation were also presented in @xcite . as for the @xmath1 resonance",
    ", it seemed to be always too wide for a such interpretation , @xmath186 mev , see @xcite .",
    "the latest data confirm this .",
    "the @xmath1 meson with the @xmath187 mev was observed in the reaction @xmath188 ( brookhaven ) , see @xcite .    in the model of the scalar @xmath10 molecule",
    "@xcite the function @xmath142was calculated in @xcite . in this paper it was found that the imaginary part of the @xmath52 amplitude gives @xmath189 of @xmath28 . in view of this",
    ", we take into account only the imaginary part of the @xmath142 . in the transitions caused by the resonance mixing due to the final state interaction only real intermediate states",
    "are involved ( the virtual states are suppressed for an extended molecule ) .",
    "because of virtual states suppression , we write in the model of @xmath10 molecule the nondiagonal elements of the inverse propagator matrix in the following way @xmath190      when @xmath191  , @xmath192 as a parameter of the model we use the decay width @xmath193 which is defined in eq.([f0pipi ] ) . in other areas of",
    "@xmath61 one can obtain the @xmath194 by analytical continuation of eq.([breit ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "since the scalar resonances lie under the @xmath10 thresholds the position of the peak in the cross section or in the mass spectrum does not coincide with @xmath195 , as one can see from analytical continuation of eq.([breit ] ) under the @xmath10 threshould @xcite .",
    "that is why it is necessary to renormalize the mass in the breit - wigner formulae @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the physical mass squared ( @xmath198 mev and @xmath199 mev ) while @xmath200 is the bare mass squared .",
    "so , the physical mass is heavier than the bare one .",
    "this circumstance is especially important in the case of a strong coupling of the scalar mesons with the @xmath10 channel as in the molecular models .    in the molecular model",
    "the coupling constant of the @xmath2 meson with the @xmath10 channel is @xcite @xmath201 notice that in this model @xmath202 mev for @xmath203 .",
    "the value of @xmath204 is fixed in the region @xmath205 gev that leads , on average , to the effective widths @xmath206 gev .      to fit the @xmath8 scattering data we write the @xmath208-wave amplitude of the @xmath207 reaction with @xmath209 as the sum of the inelastic resonance amplitude @xmath210 , in which the contributions of the @xmath2 and @xmath132 mesons are taken onto account , and the amplitude of the elastic background @xcite @xmath211 where @xmath212 the elastic background phase @xmath149 is taken in the form @xmath213 , where @xmath214 .",
