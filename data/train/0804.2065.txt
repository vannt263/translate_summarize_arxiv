    "comes the opportunity to produce heavy isotopes via the @xmath13-process . in the early expanding phase , starting with a he - rich environment the mass-8 gap would be bridged by either @xmath14c or @xmath15be reactions .",
    "these reactions would continue until a neutron rich freeze out occurs which triggers the @xmath13-process  @xcite . at this stage",
    "it would also be possible to bridge the a = 8 gap through the reaction chain @xmath16he@xmath17he@xmath18he(@xmath19)@xmath1li(@xmath20li @xmath21be  @xcite .",
    "this chain would provide an alternative path to proceed along the neutron - rich side of the line of stability towards heavier isotopes such as @xmath22s , @xmath23ar , @xmath24ca , and @xmath25ca .",
    "the origin of these neutron rich isotopes is under debate .",
    "it is of critical importance to know to what extent this chain competes with the @xmath1li(@xmath19)@xmath1be(@xmath26 ) process .",
    "an important clue to the answer depends on knowing as accurately as possible the rate of the @xmath1li(@xmath20li reaction and the neutron density .",
    "reaction chains similar to ones that are supposed to occur in type ii supernova can be found in the material ejected from neutron star mergers  @xcite and thus the importance of the accurate knowledge of this reaction is emphasized again .",
    "the rate ( @xmath27 ) of a nuclear reaction where two nuclei @xmath28 and @xmath29 interact to form the reaction products of the final channel is given by  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represents the total number of nuclei @xmath28 and @xmath29 taking part in the reaction and @xmath33 is the kronecker delta which is unity if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are identical and zero otherwise .",

    "the number densities @xmath36 are related to the matter density @xmath37 and mole fraction @xmath38 by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the avogadro number . in eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) the product @xmath41 is averaged over the maxwell- boltzmann velocity distribution and is interpreted as the reaction rate per particle pair .",
    "this is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reduced mass of the interacting nuclei , @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath45 is the relevant stellar temperature .",
    "@xmath46 represents the energy corresponding to the relative velocity @xmath35 .",
    "it is thus clear from eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) that knowledge of the reaction cross section @xmath47 as a function of the relative velocity ( or energy ) in the astrophysically relevant energy region is the prime requirement for calculating the rate of a particular reaction .",
    "since big - bang nucleosynthesis starts when the temperature has fallen to about 100 kev , the rate of the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction is of astrophysical importance for neutron energies in similar range .",
    "this reaction can proceed by both direct capture as well as via resonant capture through the 5/2@xmath48 state of @xmath0li at the excitation energy of 4.296 mev . for",
    "the inverse reaction @xmath49 , the resonant capture via this state would imply the dominance of the e2 transition multipolarity in its excitation from the @xmath50 ground state of @xmath0li .",
    "the ratio of e2 to e1 excitation has been estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for a @xmath0li projectile on a @xmath51pb target at the beam energy of 28.5 mev / nucleon .",
    "the maximum value of this ratio even at the resonance peak ( corresponding to @xmath52 = 0.26 mev ) is only 0.018 . within the energy range",
    "@xmath52 = 0 - 1 mev , this ratio is about 0.0023 .",
    "therefore , for the reaction @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li only the direct capture mechanism through e1 transition applies in this energy regime .",
    "several theoretical predictions of the rate of the @xmath1li(@xmath20li have been reported .",
    "some of them perform the nuclear structure calculations of @xmath0li and calculate the capture cross sections from the corresponding wave functions  @xcite .",
    "others estimate the rate of this reaction from the systematics that are based on information existing for other nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these rates vary from each other by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , efforts have also been made to determine the rate of this reaction by experimental methods  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1li has a very small half - life ( @xmath53 838 ms ) , a direct measurement of the cross section ( @xmath54 ) of the reaction @xmath1li(n,@xmath2)@xmath0li is nearly impossible .",
    "however , with a beam of @xmath0li , it is possible to measure the cross section ( @xmath55 ) of the reverse reaction @xmath0li + @xmath56 @xmath1li + @xmath57 ( photodisintegration process ) , and use the principle of detailed balance to deduce the cross section @xmath54 as @xmath58 in eq .",

    "@xmath62 is the wave vector corresponding to @xmath60 .    a very promising way of studying the photodisintegration process is provided by the virtual photons acting on a fast charged nuclear projectile when passing through the coulomb field of a heavy target nucleus @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this coulomb dissociation ( cd ) method is that here measurements can be performed at higher beam energies which enhances the cross sections considerably as compared to the those of the direct method . at higher energies",
    "the fragments in the final channel emerge with larger velocities which facilitates their more accurate detection .",
    "furthermore , the choice of the adequate kinematical condition of the coincidence measurements allows the study of low relative energies of the final state fragments and ensures that the target nucleus remains in the ground state during the reaction .",
    "however , the success of this method depends on nuclear breakup effects being either negligible or at least their magnitude being known as accurately as possible .    in the recent past attempts",

    "this quantity depends on the wave function of the relative motion of @xmath57 and @xmath1li in the ground as well as excited states of @xmath0li .",
    "since cd method involves excitation of the projectile to its continuum , the evaluation of @xmath72 depends sensitively on information about the continuum structure of the projectile . in ref .",
    "@xcite the continuum states were calculated by treating them as scattering states with the same @xmath73li potential which was obtained by fitting the binding energy of the @xmath0li ground state .",

    "we note that this value differs from that reported in ref  @xcite by a factor of about 4 .",
    "in this paper we use a fully quantum mechanical theory of coulomb breakup reactions to calculate the coulomb dissociation of @xmath6li which is then used to extract the rate of the capture reaction @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li . the theory of cd reactions used by us is formulated within the post form finite range distorted wave born approximation ( frdwba )  @xcite where the electromagnetic interaction between the fragments and the target nucleus is included to all orders and the breakup contributions from the entire non - resonant continuum corresponding to all the multipoles and the relative orbital angular momenta between the fragments are taken into account @xcite .",
    "full ground state wave function of the projectile , of any orbital angular momentum configuration , enters as an input into this theory . unlike the theoretical models used in ref .",
    "@xcite , this model does not require the knowledge of the positions and widths of the continuum states .",
    "thus our method is free from the uncertainties associated with the multipole strength distributions occurring in other formalisms as we need only the ground state wave function of the projectile as input .",
    "let us consider the reaction @xmath74 , where the projectile @xmath75 breaks up into fragments @xmath28 ( charged ) and @xmath29 ( uncharged ) in the coulomb field of a target @xmath76 .",

    "it should be mentioned that in eq .",
    "( [ dw ] ) , the interactions between the fragments @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the target nucleus are included to all orders , but the @xmath28-@xmath29 interaction is treated to first order only . since for relative energies of our interest there are no resonances in the @xmath57+@xmath1li continuum , we expect this approximation to be valid .",
    "it is clearly a good approximation for the deuteron and the neutron halo systems  @xcite . for those cases where",
    "higher order effects of the fragment - fragment interaction are known to be non - negligible , our model will have a limited applicability .",
    "it should be noted that in calculating the relative energy spectra within this theory explicit information about the continuum strength distribution of the projectile is not required ; the entire continuum is automatically included in our post form theory .",
    "physically , the first term in eq .",

    "the charged projectile @xmath75 and the fragment @xmath28 interacts with the target by a point coulomb interaction and hence @xmath99 and @xmath98 are substituted with appropriate coulomb distorted waves . for pure coulomb breakup , of course",
    ", the interaction between the target and the uncharged fragment @xmath29 is zero and hence @xmath100 is replaced by a plane wave .",

    "relating the post - form cd cross section to the photodissociation cross sections via eq .",
    "( 7 ) is valid only when higher order effects make negligible contribution to the cd cross sections at the relevant beam energy .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the coulomb breakup reaction involving projectiles of similar mass range , the higher order effects are almost negligible for @xmath46 of our interest ( @xmath70 100 kev ) for beam energies around 30 mev / nucleon .",
    "therefore , necessary conditions for the validity of eq .  ( 7 ) are fulfilled for the present case .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that in general , the validity of eq .",
    "( 7 ) in each case must be checked before using this to extract the photodissociation cross section from the post - form coulomb dissociation cross section .    the radiative capture cross section , @xmath108 , for the reaction , @xmath109 ,",
    "is then related to the photo dissociation cross section , @xmath101 , by the principle of detailed balance @xcite ( eq .  ( 3 ) for the reaction of our interest ) .",
    "as shown above , the ground state wave function of the projectile enters into the calculations of the cd cross sections within our theory . for @xmath110li , we obtain this wave function by assuming the neutron-@xmath1li core interaction to be of woods - saxon type whose depth is searched , for a given configuration , to reproduce the corresponding binding energy .    within this model , the valence neutron in @xmath0li ( spin - parity @xmath50 )",
    "is assumed to move relative to an inert @xmath1li core ( with intrinsic spin - parity @xmath111 ) in a woods - saxon plus spin - orbit potential , with an adjustable depth @xmath112 for the initial channel : @xmath113 where @xmath114 using @xmath75=0.52 fm , @xmath115=1.25 fm , @xmath1li core radius , @xmath27=2.49 fm and the spin - orbit strength , @xmath116 = 0.351 fm , the depth of the woods - saxon potential was searched to reproduce the one - neutron separation energy of @xmath0li ( 4.05 mev ) .",
    "this yielded @xmath117 mev . with this potential ,",
    "the rms distance of the core - neutron relative motion and the rms size of @xmath0li came out to be 3.10 fm and 2.55 fm , respectively .",
    "we have calculated the capture cross sections of the @xmath1li(n,@xmath2)@xmath0li reaction as a function of the c.m .",
    "relative energy ( @xmath118 ) between neutron and @xmath1li in the range of ( 0 - 1 ) mev , using the coulomb breakup cross section obtained in our method .",
    "since , our aim in this paper , is to narrow down the theory dependent uncertainty in the extracted rate of this reaction , we compare our results with the same experimental capture cross sections as those in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the direct capture cross sections to the ground state of @xmath110li obtained from the coulomb dissociation of @xmath110li on pb ( solid line ) and u targets ( dotted line ) at 28.5 mev / a beam energy . in the inset of this figure we have highlighted the values of the cross sections in the astrophysically interesting region ( for @xmath118 @xmath119 100 kev ) by presenting cross sections as a function of @xmath118 on a log - log plot . as expected , the capture cross section is independent of the target used during the coulomb dissociation .",
    "it should be noted that while we have used a spectroscopic factor ( @xmath120 ) of @xmath121 for the ground state of @xmath0li which has been extracted recently from a transfer reaction measurement  @xcite , a shell model value of 0.94 was used for it in ref .",
    "it is worth mentioning that transfer reaction cross sections are very sensitive to the angular momentum state of the projectile and hence have been widely used to extract nuclear spectroscopic factors .",
    "had we used the shell model value of @xmath120 , our results would have been proportionately higher .    nevertheless , it should be noted that the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite have uncertainty of approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "furthermore , the second coulomb dissociation measurement of @xmath0li as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the extracted capture cross section could even be substantially lower than those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore , to firm up the theoretical capture cross sections",
    "as extracted from the coulomb dissociation method , the uncertainty in the experimental data should be minimized as much as possible .    reaction rate ( @xmath27 ) calculated from the capture cross sections are plotted in fig .  2 as a function of t@xmath122 ( the temperature equivalent of relative energy in units of 10@xmath0k ) .",
    "solid and dotted lines show reaction rates derived from the coulomb dissociation of @xmath6li on pb and u targets , respectively .",
    "the rate changes in the range ( 2800 - 3100 ) @xmath123mole@xmath4 s@xmath4 for t@xmath122 between 0.5 and 2 and the value at t@xmath122 = 1 is approximately 2900 @xmath3mole@xmath4 s@xmath4 , when averaged over the two targets .    as is evident from the integrand in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , for a fixed stellar temperature , the maximum contribution to the reaction rate is highly dependent on the reaction cross section and in turn on the relative energy . at t@xmath122 = 1 ,",
    "the maximum contribution to the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction rate comes from a low relative energy of 45 kev . at this low energy",
    "it is extremely difficult to measure reaction cross sections by direct methods .",
    "this is where the power of the cd method becomes more evident as an indirect method in nuclear astrophysics . with recent advances in experimental techniques",
    "it is possible to measure relative energy spectra at quite low relative energies .",
    ".the comparison of reaction rates of the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reported as reported by various authors [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table i , we present a comparison of the rates of the reaction @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reported by various workers .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rate of the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction extracted by us is within 30@xmath12 in agreement with that computed from the capture cross sections of ref .",
    "@xcite where a completely different theoretical model of cd process was used . on the other hand ,",
    "our rate is about 45 - 35@xmath12 smaller than those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite where they have been obtained from structure model calculations of @xmath0li .",
    "our values are in sharp disagreement with the results of ref.@xcite where calculations were performed within the spd - shell model and with those of ref.@xcite which have been obtained from the systematics of similar nuclei . the rate of ref .  @xcite is larger by a factor of 7.2 whereas that of ref .",
    "@xcite is even larger ( by a factor of almost 15 ) .",
    "it may be worthwhile to see what these calculations would predict if the latest experimental information on the spectroscopic factor for the @xmath0li @xmath124li + @xmath57 partition was taken into consideration .",
    "thus , our calculations do not support the large rate for the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction .",
    "this would suggest that a significant portion of the @xmath5li would remain available for alpha - capture to @xmath125b and would not be destroyed by the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction does not hamper the formation of @xmath712 elements through the @xmath1li(@xmath126,n)@xmath125b(n,@xmath2)@xmath127be@xmath128c@xmath129 reaction chain .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the rate of the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction by studying the inverse photodissociation reaction in terms of the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0li on heavy targets at 28.5 mev / a using a theory formulated within the finite range post form distorted wave born approximation .",
    "this capture reaction provides , in an inhomogeneous early universe , a leak from the primary chain of nucleosynthesis , thereby reducing the production of heavy elements .",
    "the advantage of our theoretical method is that it is free from the uncertainties associated with the multipole strength distributions of the projectile .",
    "the newly extracted experimental ground state spectroscopic factor for the @xmath6li @xmath130 @xmath1li @xmath131 partition  @xcite , has been incorporated in our theory .",
    "the rate of this reaction at a temperature of 10@xmath0k has been found to be about 2900 @xmath3 mole@xmath4 s@xmath4 .",
    "this value is in agreement ( within 30@xmath12 ) with the earlier coulomb dissociation analysis of this data using a different theoretical model .",
    "thus theoretical uncertainty in the rate of @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li reaction as determined from the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0li is much lower than the experimental uncertainties in this data .",
    "therefore , it would be worthwhile to make more precise measurements of the coulomb dissociation reaction .",
    "the maximum contribution to the reaction rate at this stellar temperature , came from a low relative energy of 45 kev .",
    "thus in future experiments an attempt should be made to measure the @xmath5li(n,@xmath2)@xmath6li capture cross section at this low relative energy to get a more accurate picture of the reaction rate .",
    "our calculations also suggest that this reaction rate is not high enough to destroy enough of @xmath1li so as to significantly reduce the formation of @xmath712 elements through the @xmath1li(@xmath126,n)@xmath125b(n,@xmath2)@xmath127be@xmath128c@xmath129 reaction chain .",
