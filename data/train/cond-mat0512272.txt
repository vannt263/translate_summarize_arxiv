    "in the last years , a large amount of work has been done to clarify the properties of unconventional magnetic systems .",
    "indeed , the presence of frustrated interactions , generated either by the geometry of the lattice or by the competing interactions , can give rise to many anomalous low - energy properties .",
    "@xcite one of the most exciting is the possibility to obtain phases with no magnetic order even at zero temperature .",
    "@xcite the actual interest in this subject has been recently renewed by the discovery of several materials  @xcite that do not show any sign of magnetic order down to very low temperatures . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "a considerable progress has been done in elucidating the possible unconventional states and , apart from magnetic phases , it is now well accepted that many systems exhibit a large variety of disordered ground states .",
    "one class of such paramagnetic states is given by the so - called valence - bond solids , where pairs of nearest - neighbor spins form a singlet , leading to an ordered pattern of valence bonds .",
    "these states explicitly break the translational symmetry , implying a degenerate ground state , and represent the two - dimensional extension of the celebrated dimerized state , rather well established in quasi - one - dimensional materials .",
    "@xcite another class of disordered phases is given by the so - called spin liquids , that do not break any local symmetry .",
    "it is now rather widely accepted that also spin liquids possess some degeneracy , or even a gapless spectrum , and have some kind of order , called topological order , related to non - local operators .",
    "@xcite    much recent research has focused on the way to describe transitions between different quantum phases .",
    "indeed , from the landau s arguments valid for classical critical phenomena , if one exclude a delicate fine tuning of the parameters , there is no reason to have a continuous transition between two phases with different symmetries of the order parameters , like for instance between a magnetic system and a valence - bond solid , and a first - order transition would be the most natural scenario .",
    "however , very recently ,  @xcite these arguments have been questioned and it has been argued that the situation can be more complex and richer in quantum systems , where the landau paradigm could be violated , giving rise to an appealing way to escape a first - order transition .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that a quantum phase transition is intrinsically different from a classical one . in particular , when considering quantum phases , the natural description is no longer by using order parameters but instead by considering new degrees of freedom carrying fractional quantum numbers , that emerge at the critical point .",
    "the arguments given in refs .   and  , based on field - theory approaches , are rather convincing but it is natural to ask if microscopic spin models , defined on a lattice , could present the same low - energy critical behavior . in this sense , however , we face a technical difficulty : a good diagnosis would require to study large enough clusters , but this is not possible since quantum monte carlo simulations of frustrated antiferromagnets are plagued with a very severe minus sign problem . in this respect",
    ", it is important to find out microscopic models that do not suffer from this problem but , at the same time , present phase transitions between quantum phases .",
    "recently , sandvik and collaborators  @xcite introduced a spin - half model on the two - dimensional square lattice in the presence of a particular ring - exchange interaction : @xmath0 where @xmath1 } ( s^+_i s^-_j s^+_k s^-_l + s^-_i s^+_j s^-_k s^+_l ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 denotes a pair of nearest neighbor sites and @xmath3 $ ] indicates the sites on the corners of a plaquette . in particular , @xmath4 is a ring - exchange interactions that acts as a cyclic permutation on the spins of a given plaquette whenever they are in a @xmath5 configuration with parallel spins on opposite corners .",
    "@xcite the case with @xmath6 and @xmath7 is considered , in order to avoid the sign problem .",
    "notice that @xmath8 is invariant under global u(1 ) transformations @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiring ] ) has been investigated by using quantum monte carlo  @xcite and it has been shown that , at zero temperature and zero magnetic field , there is a transition between a ferromagnetic phase , stable for small values of @xmath10 , and a dimerized one , characterized by columnar order at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , stable for intermediate ring - exchange couplings . finally , for large @xmath10 a checkerboard phase is also expected .",
    "@xcite note that , in our notation , @xmath13 is twice time bigger than the one used in refs .   and  .",
    "once scaled in our units , their best estimate for the transition point from the magnetic to the dimerized phase is @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite in the original paper ,  @xcite it has been shown that , by increasing the strength of the ring exchange , both the spin stiffness @xmath15 and the magnetization @xmath16 decrease and eventually vanish , with a corresponding insurgence of a finite dimer order parameter . hence , the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiring ] ) has been suggested as a prototype model to test the ideas of refs .   and  .",
    "however , subsequent and more accurate calculations have raised some doubt on the previous ones , suggesting instead a weak first - order transition .",
    "@xcite the actual nature of the transition is therefore still controversial .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different point of view to investigate the properties of a phase transition between a magnetic and a dimerized phase of a generic spin hamiltonian with sufficiently short - range interactions . indeed , instead of calculating the order parameters and the stiffness , we derive strong constraints on the excitation spectrum across a continuous phase transition between a magnetically ordered and a dimerized phase , breaking translational symmetry .",
    "these constraints can be verified by using numerical techniques , such as the green s function monte carlo method .",
    "@xcite in our opinion this way to proceed represents the first attempt to clarify the evolution of the excitation spectrum and can give important insight into the nature of the transition point also in other contexts .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we develop the general theoretical formalism , in sec .  [ sec2 ] we present our numerical results , and in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we describe in detail the implications of a continuous phase transition from a magnetically ordered phase to a dimerized one on the excitation spectrum near the quantum critical point . in the following",
    ", we will consider an hamiltonian with a generic translational invariant two - spin coupling and su(2 ) symmetry , and at the end of the section we will also discuss the cases with u(1 ) symmetry or multi - spin interactions .",
    "let us consider the heisenberg hamiltonian on a two - dimensional lattice with @xmath17 sites : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling between the spins at site @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the spin operator at the site @xmath20 .",
    "for a translational invariant magnetic coupling that depends only upon @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 , we can perform the fourier transform and easily obtain : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 define the fourier transform of the local spin operator and the magnetic coupling , respectively . in the following , we will consider interactions that are sufficiently short range , that is : @xmath28 for the su(2 ) case , the eigenstates can be classified according to the total spin @xmath29 and the ground state , here denoted by @xmath30 , is generally a singlet with momentum @xmath31 . by means of the so - called feynman construction , originally introduced to describe the excitations of the liquid helium ,  @xcite we can easily define a variational state for the triplet excited state with momentum @xmath32 with respect to the ground state : @xmath33 @xmath34 being one of the three components of the total spin @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "then , it is easy to calculate the variational energy @xmath37 of @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for the average value over @xmath30 and the function @xmath41 is given by the double commutator @xmath42 \\right ] \\rangle.\\ ] ] by using standard commutation relations for the spin operators and by summing over all the spin components @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44   \\langle { \\vec s}_{k } \\cdot { \\vec s}_{-k } \\rangle.\\ ] ] after performing the inverse fourier transform , we have @xmath45 -1 \\ } \\langle { \\vec s}_i \\cdot { \\vec s}_j \\rangle \\le \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{q^2}{2n } \\sum_{i , j } |j_{i , j}| |r_i - r_j|^2    where we used that @xmath46 and the short - range condition  ( [ shortrange ] ) . notice that the previous bound does not rely upon a small-@xmath32 expansion , but it is instead valid for all momenta .",
    "therefore , we arrive to the important result that : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the static magnetic structure factor , that , in the su(2 ) case , does not depend upon @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath38 is a variational state , its average energy has to be higher than the lowest exact triplet excitation with given momentum @xmath49 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the inequality  ( [ final ] ) will also hold for the exact triplet excitation energy with momentum @xmath49 .    in the following",
    "we will argue that the rigorous bound on the excitation spectrum  ( [ final ] ) quite naturally implies the existence of a new branch of gapless excitations close to an hypothetical second - order phase transition from a magnetic phase to a dimerized one .",
    "we will focus on the square lattice case and an ordered phase with staggered magnetization at @xmath50 , but similar results can be also found in the case of different lattice structures or spiral magnetic orders .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we can imagine that @xmath51 depends upon one parameter @xmath52 , proportional to the frustration of model : for instance , in the @xmath53 model @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that , by increasing the frustrating parameter @xmath52 , the system has a continuous transition from a magnetically ordered phase to a dimerized one .",
    "in this latter , the lowest triplet excitation remains gapped in the thermodynamic limit and the ground state is four - fold degenerate , with four different momenta @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "again , the following arguments will also hold for any other dimer patterns , having ground states with momenta @xmath60 and @xmath61 . by applying the feynman construction with @xmath62 to the state with @xmath63 and by using the inequality  ( [ final ] )",
    ", we obtain that @xmath64 in the dimerized region , i.e. , for @xmath65 , the spectrum is gapped , implying that @xmath66 is finite , and the constraint  ( [ bound ] ) does not give us any useful information on the excitations .",
    "however , if the transition is continuous , the four - fold degeneracy will hold down to the critical point @xmath67 , where @xmath66 diverges , because of the incipient magnetic phase , stable for @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , at the critical point the spin - spin correlations are expected to decay as @xmath69 , leading to @xmath70 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath71 can be found by considering the corresponding classical model in three dimensions . in the heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor interactions",
    ", we have that @xmath72 , implying a rather strong divergence of the static structure factor at the critical point . however , this divergence can be much weaker , i.e. , @xmath73 , in the case where no free topological singularities are allowed but only pairs of them are present .",
    "@xcite we point out here that our conclusions remain valid as long as @xmath74 , the structure factor being logarithmically divergent in the case of @xmath75 .",

    "( [ bound ] ) implies the existence of a branch of excitations , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , that becomes gapless at @xmath67 .",
    "analogously , by considering the ground state with momentum @xmath81 , we obtain a branch of excitations with @xmath80 and @xmath63 .",
    "this outcome contrasts the common understanding of the low - energy properties of magnetic systems with o(3 ) symmetry , which contains only two branches of gapless excitations at @xmath56 and @xmath62 , while the triplet excitations at @xmath63 and @xmath63 are always gapped .",
    "@xcite therefore , one is left with the following three possibilities : the first one is to have an o(3 ) critical point with more than two gapless modes , not described by standard theories of magnetic phase transitions .",
    "the second one is that the dimerized phase is separated from the magnetic phase by a first - order transition : in that case the spectrum can evolve discontinuously and the triplet states at @xmath63 and @xmath63 can remain gapped .",
    "the third possibility is that there is still a continuous transition but the non - magnetic phase does not break the translational invariance and , therefore , has no dimer order .",
    "then , the dimerized phase could be eventually stabilized through a further ( continuous ) transition .",

    "now we would like to discuss what happens for systems with different kinds of interactions . in the case of multi - spin interactions , it is easy to prove that we can arrive to similar expressions and the only difference is the prefactor , due to a different value of the double commutator  ( [ double0 ] ) .",
    "a little more care must be paid to a model with u(1 ) symmetry . here",
    ", the total spin @xmath29 does not commute with the hamiltonian , and only @xmath84 is a good quantum number .",
    "furthermore , the states with @xmath5 can be also classified according the discrete _ particle - hole _ symmetry ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 . in the weakly frustrated limit , without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider the ferromagnetic @xmath87 model , that has only one gapless branch at @xmath56 . on a finite cluster ,",
    "the ground state has @xmath5 and can be taken to be even under the ph symmetry , i.e. , with @xmath88 . in this case , we can construct two different variational states for the low - energy excitations .",
    "the first one , with @xmath89 , is given by @xmath90 , @xmath91 being the fourier transform of @xmath92 , and has @xmath93 instead , the second possibility , with @xmath5 and @xmath94 , is given by @xmath95 and has @xmath96 in the dimerized phase the ground state is four - fold degenerate with four different momenta @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , all of them having @xmath5 and @xmath88 [ this is equivalent to have all singlets in the su(2 ) case ] .",
    "then , in close relation with the su(2 ) case , the feynman construction  ( [ boundxy ] ) with @xmath97 applied to the state with momentum @xmath81 implies the existence of a gapless branch of excitations at @xmath81 with @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath99 is finite for @xmath100 and the structure factor in the denominator diverges at the critical point , as @xmath101 .",
    "hence , we arrive to the same conclusions as before : excluding the possibility of having more than one gapless branch in a model with o(2 ) symmetry , in contrast with semi - classical approaches ,  @xcite the transition must be either first order or second order to a non - dimerized phase .",

    "let us now turn to the spin - wave operators @xmath91 and @xmath131 , in order to apply the arguments developed in the previous section and assess the nature of the transition .",
    "first of all , it should be noticed that , in the @xmath87 model , @xmath131 acts on the ground state by creating a standard spin - wave excitation .",
    "this can be easily seen by considering the holstein - primakoff representation at the leading order in the @xmath136 expansion : @xmath137 after standard calculations , we arrive to the result that @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the spin - wave ground state and @xmath140 is the creation operator of the elementary excitation , defined by the bogoliubov transformation .",

    ", it turns out rather clearly that @xmath77 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit for all the values of the ring - exchange couplings , also very close to the transition point . of course , we can not rule out the existence of a very tiny region , near to the transition point , in which this gap would drop down to zero .",
    "another possibility for missing the vanishing behavior of the gap could be due to an anomalous size scaling , that changes its behavior beyond a characteristic length scale @xmath146 much bigger than the values of @xmath119 considered here .",
    "however , from our gfmc calculations , we do not have any sizable sign that could indicate the existence of gapless excitation at @xmath81 or @xmath63 , and even at the transition point @xmath14 the extrapolated value of @xmath77 remains clearly finite . since a clear dimer order appears as soon as we enter the disordered region ,  @xcite we can safely rule out the possibility to have a spin - liquid phase in between the ferromagnetic and the dimerized phases .",
    "therefore , our results on @xmath77 strongly suggest that a first - order transition is the more likely scenario in this o(2 ) model with ring - exchange interactions . similarly ,",

    "in conclusion , we investigated the excitation spectrum of a spin model close to the transition from a magnetic phase to a dimerized one , which is particularly important in view of the theoretical predictions of senthil and coworkers .",
    "in particular , we considered an @xmath87 model in presence of a frustrating ring - exchange interaction , a model that certainly leads to a magnetic - dimer transition , as recently shown by sandvik and collaborators .",
    "@xcite    the central part of our work is the derivation of a general constraint for the excitation spectrum for a broad class of short - range spin hamiltonians : whenever the transition is second - order a new branch of gapless excitations must exists , besides the ones expected from standard semi - classical approaches . in particular , on the square lattice with a typical four - fold dimer ground state , these modes are spin - wave - like excitations at momenta @xmath63 and @xmath81 . on the contrary , by using a numerically exact technique , we did not find any evidence of these gapless modes .",
    "therefore , our results rule out both conventional and unconventional continuous transition , implying that a first - order transition represents the most likely scenario , in agreement with recent calculations .",
