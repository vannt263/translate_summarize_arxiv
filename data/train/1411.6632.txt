    "super - k has measured the atmospheric neutrino backgrounds for 10.7 years  @xcite . in total , 7,755 single - ring zero - decay electron events and 2,105 single - ring electron events have been detected in the energy range of @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively . for super - k and hyper - k , we use all 9,860 events , in the range of @xmath176 as conservative backgrounds although higher energy background events are less relevant to @xmath7 from a lighter mass of @xmath6 which produces a less energetic event .",
    "thus , we have a yearly background event rate : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the volume of the detector . for pingu",
    ", we use all the events including multi - ring and @xmath179-like events in the @xmath180 energy range due to a higher @xmath163 and a poor reconstruction efficiency of the cherenkov rings  @xcite .",
    "after rescaling by the effective detector volume of pingu , @xmath181 , we obtain a background rate of 14,100/year .",
    "the boosted dm flux comes from a point - like source , the sun , while the atmospheric neutrino backgrounds are almost uniform in the entire sky .",

    "note that the number of signal events , @xmath189 , is independent of @xmath190 .",
    "while the @xmath185 sensitivity curve for super - k is obtained based on the 10.7 years of super - k data , those for hyper - k and pingu are estimated assuming the same running time for the convenience of comparison .",
    "pingu can detect more signal events than super - k as shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] , but will be able to cover a smaller parameter region due to its poorer angular resolution .",
    "thus , hyper - k is currently the best experiment to find the boosted dm flux from the sun due to its larger volume , even though it has the same angular resolution as super - k .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the detection prospects of boosted dm @xmath7 from the earth . as shown in section 9.4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio between the capture rates in the sun and earth is given by @xmath191 due to the much smaller mass ( @xmath192 ) and escape velocity ( @xmath193 ) of the earth . in the case of no self - interaction and no evaporation , the boosted dm",
    "flux is simply proportional to @xmath194 where r is the distance between a detector and a source of the boosted dm .",
    "for the earth , very tiny capture rates @xmath195 can be compensated by the smaller distance from the source of the boosted dm . in the absence of self - interaction and evaporation",
    ", we find @xmath196 where @xmath197 km is the distance between the sun and the earth and @xmath198 km is the radius of the earth .",
    "the evaporation effect is efficient only for a very low dm mass @xmath199 gev for the sun , whereas it is important up to @xmath200 gev for the earth due to the much smaller escape velocity of the earth @xcite .",
    "the dm self - capture rate @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath59 ( see eq .",
    "( [ selfcapture ] ) ) , and the seed of @xmath59 is determined by @xmath61 since @xmath87 .",
    "a smaller @xmath61 therefore induces a smaller @xmath62 , and consequently , self - capture is negligible for the earth @xcite since @xmath201 . in summary , without self - interactions , @xmath202 could be comparable to @xmath203 or less depending on @xmath204 .",
    "however , with self - interactions , @xmath202 is much smaller than @xmath158 since self - capture is negligible for the earth , while it enhances the flux significantly in the sun .",
    "moreover the earth is not a point - like source due to the short distance from the source unlike the sun .",
    "even if we consider only the inner core of the earth , @xmath205 km , we should integrate over a @xmath206 cone around the center of the earth .",
    "thus , the background events by atmospheric neutrinos are governed by @xmath207 instead of the angular resolution of each experiment @xmath188 . especially for super - k and hyper - k with @xmath208",
    ", we have @xmath209 times larger backgrounds events for the boosted dm flux from the earth compared to the analysis for the sun . even for the case of @xmath210 , the final signal significance @xmath186 for the earth signals",
    "is therefore much less than that for the solar signals .",
    "the current paradigm of cdm is extremely successful in explaining much of cosmological and astronomical data .",
    "however there still exist several questions including the missing satellite problem , the core / cusp problem , issues in substructure , and the too - big - to - fail problem .",
    "self - interacting multi - component dark matter provides profound insight into these problems and hence it is imperative to consider detection prospects of such scenarios .    in this paper , we have investigated the discovery potential of the boosted dm flux from the sun in large volume neutrino experiments such as super - k , hyper - k , and pingu .",
    "we considered a model in ref .",
    "@xcite and additionally introduced self - interaction to the heavier secluded dm .",
    "the heavier dm particle @xmath6 is thermalized with the assistance of the other dm @xmath7 , i.e. through the _ assisted freeze - out _ mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 can be effectively captured in the sun due to its self - interaction in the range favored by cosmological simulations and measurements .",
    "the accumulated dark matter then annihilates to the lighter sister with a large lorentz boost . in a large volume neutrino detector ,",
    "the boosted dark matter can be probed by measuring electrons via elastic scattering with the @xmath7 from the sun .",
    "certainly a detector with a larger volume and lower electron energy threshold @xmath163 performs better .",
    "improvement on angular resolution at future experiments is crucial in detecting boosted dark matter from the sun , as atmospheric neutrino backgrounds do not exhibit any directionality and can be efficiently reduced for a point - like source , the sun , in contrast to the the galactic center region .",
    "searches for the signals by the boosted dm fluxes from the sun ( this study ) and the gc ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) are complementary , since the parameter space that is accessible to one is not accessible to the other .",
    "there are two main complementary effects .",
    "first , for the gc signal the value of @xmath28 needs to be higher , @xmath211 , to overcome the small flux , while for the solar signal @xmath28 needs to be smaller , @xmath212 , to reduce the energy loss inside the sun .",
    "second , without dm self - interactions one prefers an nfw - like cusp dm halo profiles to enhance the gc signal , whereas with dm self - interactions a more cored profile to relatively suppress the gc signal and allow the solar signal .",
    "thus , searches for both signals from the gc and the sun should be conducted at the same time .",
    "near completion of this study , we have noticed that a related study , ref .",
    "@xcite was submitted to arxiv.org .",
    "we have used a different reference model and focused on implications of self - interaction in the context of the boosted dark matter from the sun .",
    "we would like to thank yen - hsun lin for providing valuable information on the calculation of the dm evolution , and chang hyon ha and jesse thaler for helpful discussions .",
