    "our spectral analysis suggests that a different mass - velocity distribution may be realized in ptf10vgv (  [ spettrale ] ) , which may lead to a larger @xmath84 than estimated on the basis of the light - curve properties , since the latter are mostly determined by the opacity in the inner ejecta .",
    "our pre - discovery upper limits can be used to constrain the radius of the stellar progenitor of ptf10vgv via comparison with model predictions @xcite .",
    "we apply a bolometric correction to our @xmath0-band data , computed assuming that the sn emits as a black body at temperature @xmath85 ( and neglecting redshift corrections ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 ; @xmath88 is the p48 mould-@xmath0 filter transmission ; @xmath89hz ; and @xmath90 is the photometric zero - point flux ( @xmath91erg@xmath92s@xmath57hz@xmath57 for ab magnitudes ) .",

    "the optical luminosity of core - collapse sne after breakout depends on the ejecta composition ( via the opacity parameter ) , the stellar radius , and the @xmath97 ratio . a larger @xmath97 ratio and a lower he fraction both increase the predicted luminosity , for a given stellar radius ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , the stellar models analyzed by @xcite have @xmath97 lower than we derive here , and a high surface he fraction .",
    "so the bound on the progenitor radius derived from the comparison with these models is likely over - estimated .",
    "similar limits ( @xmath102 ) can be derived using the predictions by nakar & sari ( 2010 ; black line in their figure 3 ) .",
    "but this model is accurate only up to @xmath103hr after the explosion , since recombination is not treated .    using @xmath82m@xmath5 and @xmath83erg , as derived above , the tightest constraint , @xmath104 ,",
    "is obtained from the c / o model of @xcite , that accounts for the dependence of the opacity on the envelope composition .",
    "the same model , for an envelope composed of mostly he , gives us @xmath105 .",
    "thus , @xmath106 is a reasonable estimate ( considering that progenitors of type ic sne may contain a small fraction of he in the outer layers ; * ? ? ?",
    "applying this same analytical model to the first clear detection of sn1994i ( sauer et al .",
    "2006 , figure 8 ; richmond et al .",
    "1996 , figure 7 ) , we get @xmath3 , considering that @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and that the luminosity of sn1994i at the time of detection was @xmath109 times smaller than the one of ptf10vgv .",
    "our limits for ptf10vgv , @xmath110 , are consistent with a small wolf - rayet star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected for a highly stripped sn  ic . almost all galactic wn stars with hydrogen ( wnl ; e.g. , hamann et al .",
    "2006 ) have @xmath111 , and all of those reported there have @xmath112 .",
    "our result thus favors a progenitor having no hydrogen at the surface ( wne , wc or wo , e.g. , sander et al .",
    "2011 ) , in agreement with the fact that ic sne progenitors are generally thought to be stripped of their h- ( and he- ) rich layers ( e.g. , gal - yam et al . 2005 ; smartt 2009 ) .",
