    "in this talk i discuss some aspects of the phenomenology of a moderately light charged higgs with @xmath13 gev , at the lhc . a charged higgs in this mass range is still allowed in the nmssm at low @xmath2  @xcite as well as in  mssm in the cpx - scenario  @xcite , respecting all the lep - ii bounds  @xcite . in both cases",
    ", there exists a neutral higgs boson , @xmath4 , which is predominantly pseudoscalar and hence can be much lighter than the lep - ii bound of @xmath14 gev in the cp - conserving mssm  @xcite . as a result , there exists a small window in the @xmath15@xmath16 plane at low @xmath17 and @xmath18 gev  @xcite , which is still allowed in the aforementioned cpx scenario , even after lep - ii constraints are taken into account . in both the cases ,",
    "the nmssm as well as the mssm , the @xmath0 has a large branching ratio in the @xmath3 channel  @xcite and the light @xmath4 decays dominantly into a @xmath5 pair .",
    "this thus gives a striking @xmath6 signal at the lhc , where one of the top quarks decays into the @xmath7 channel , via @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the characteristic correlation between the @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 invariant mass peaks helps reduce the sm background very effectively .",
    "further , in the cpx - scenario this @xmath4 has reduced couplings to a @xmath6 pair as well . as a result , in the above mentioned window in the parameter space , none of the usual search channels for the neutral higgs will have a reach either at the tevatron or at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the decay of a light @xmath0 , produced in the @xmath19 decay , provides an additional channel to search for such a neutral scalar and help ` fill ' this hole which exists in this case . for these low values of @xmath2",
    ", the @xmath0 can not be searched via @xmath20 and thus there is no lhc reach for the @xmath0 as well .",
    "thus the suggested topology can provide a signal for the both the light charged @xmath0 and the light @xmath4 ( which is mostly a pseudoscalar ) in these regions of the parameter space , both for the nmssm and the  mssm .",
    "in the mssm @xmath21 is stabilized at the ew scale ` naturally ' if one introduces an additional chiral superfield  @xcite , thus solving the so called @xmath21 problem .",
    "this class of supersymmetric models , with additional singlet higgs fields , is called the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite .",
    "further , the ` little hierarchy ' problem caused by the non observation of the light neutral higgs at lep - ii , may also be eased in the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "while adding a singlet complex scalar field does not affect the charged higgs boson pair @xmath0 of the mssm directly , it has a strong indirect effect on the phenomenology of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "this effect comes from the modification of the mssm mass relations between the doublet scalars @xmath22 and pseudoscalar @xmath23 and the resulting modification of the @xmath24 mass bound . because of this modification it is possible to satisfy the lep-2 limit on the @xmath24 mass even with a light @xmath23 , which in turn implies a moderately light @xmath0 boson .",
    "the relaxation of the @xmath23 and @xmath0 mass limits of the mssm is most pronounced in the moderate @xmath15 region .",
    "the superpotential of the nmssm higgs sector in terms of the singlet and doublet higgs superfields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , can be written as  @xcite : w = _ 1 _ 2 - k 3 ^3 .",
    "[ one ] the resulting @xmath27 term of the higgs potential is v_f = ^2 x^2 ( v^2_1 + v^2_2 ) + ^2 v^2_1 v^2_2 + k^2x^4 - 2k x^2 v_1 v_2 , [ two ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31-term is the same as in mssm , i.e. v_d = 18 ( g^2 + g^2 ) ( v^2_1 - v^2_2)^2 + 12 g^2 v^2_1 v^2_2 .",
    "[ three ] comparing the @xmath27-term of the mssm , @xmath32 , with eq .",
    "[ two ] one gets = x _ eff , [ four ] which naturally explains why the supersymmetric @xmath21 parameter has a relatively low value as required for ewsb .",
    "in fact this solution to the so called @xmath21-problem of the mssm was the original motivation for the nmssm .",
    "but the remaining terms of eq . [ two ] lead to modifications of the neutral higgs boson masses of the mssm . in particular",
    "the resulting upper bound of the lightest higgs scalar mass is  @xcite , m^2_h_1 m^2_z ^2(2 ) + 2 ^ 2 m^2_w g^2 ^2(2 ) + , [ five ] where the first term coming from the @xmath33 ( eq . [ three ] ) and the radiative correction @xmath34 are the same as in mssm .",
    "but the additional contribution in the middle comes from the second term of @xmath35 ( eq . [ two ] ) .",
    "note that this additional contribution is most pronounced in the low to moderate @xmath15 region , where the mssm mass bound coming from the first term of eq .",
    "[ five ] is very small .",
    "therefore it relaxes the mssm bound on @xmath36 and hence the resulting lower limit on @xmath37 most significantly over this range of @xmath15 .",
    "this in turn relaxes the lower limit of the charged higgs mass , which is related to the doublet pseudoscalar mass via m^2_h^+ = m^2_a + m^2_w ( 1 - 2 ^ 2 g^2 ) [ six ] along with a small radiative correction .",
    "this is helped further due to the additional ( negative ) contribution in eq .",
    "note that the additional contributions of eqs .",
    "[ five ] and [ six ] depend only on the @xmath38 coupling @xmath39 , represented by the first term of the superpotential of eq .",
    ". therefore the eqs .",
    "[ five ] and [ six ] hold also for the so called minimal nonminimal supersymmetric standard model ( mnssm ) , which assumes only the first term of the superpotential  @xcite .",
    "finally the upper bound of eq .",
    "[ five ] will only be useful if one can find an upper limit on @xmath39 .",
    "such a limit can be derived  @xcite from the requirement that all the couplings of the model remain perturbative upto some high energy scale , usually taken to be the gut scale .",
    "such an upper limit on @xmath39 has been estimated in  @xcite as a function of @xmath15 using two - loop renormalization group equations .",
    "for quantitative evaluation of the nmssm higgs spectrum we consider the complete higgs potential as given in terms of these parameters in  @xcite . the lower limit of the @xmath0 mass has been estimated as a function of @xmath15 in  @xcite by varying all these five nmssm parameters over the allowed ranges , which include the constraints from lep-2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 mass limit is shown in figure  [ fig : nmssmlim ] by the dark solid curve along with the most conservative mssm limit ( shown by the dotted curve ) , corresponding to maximal stop mixing , which gives the largest radiative correction @xmath34 .",
    "the nmssm limit has practically no sensitivity to stop mixing .",
    "in addition the thin solid curve indicates the limit in the nmssm where we require that the effective @xmath21 parameter given by eq .  [",
    "four ] be bigger than @xmath40 gev as favoured by the chargino mass constraint from lep - ii .",
    "the lep-2 mass limit from direct search of @xmath41 events is also shown by the dashed curve for comparison  @xcite .",
    "in fact it might be interesting to check whether the flavour physics constraints allow this moderately light charged higgs in this region of the parameter space .",
    "there is no limit from tevatron in the moderate @xmath15 region shown in figure  [ fig : nmssmlim ] .",
    "one sees from figure  [ fig : nmssmlim ] that even the most conservative mssm limit implies @xmath0 mass @xmath42 gev ( 175 gev ) for @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast in the nmssm one can have a @xmath0 mass @xmath44 gev over this moderate @xmath15 region , going down to the direct lep-2 limit of 86 gev at @xmath45 .",
    "note however that requiring that the effective @xmath21 parameter @xmath46 be greater than 100 gev , as favored by the lep chargino search , increases this mass limit to @xmath47 gev  @xcite .",
    "the steep vertical rise at left reflects the well - known fixed - point solution at @xmath48 , where the top yukawa coupling blows up at the gut scale . thus allowing for possible intermediate scale physics one can evade the steep nmssm mass limit at low @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "in contrast the mssm limit holds independent of any intermediate scale physics ansatz .    the indirect lower bounds on the charged higgs boson mass following from the lep limits on the neutral higgs bosons in the mssm with maximal stop mixing ( dotted curve ) , the nmssm with no constraint on @xmath21 ( thick solid curve ) and nmssm with @xmath49 gev ( thin solid curve ) . the direct lep limit on the charged higgs boson mass",
    "is also shown for comparison by the dashed curve . ]",
    "we have investigated the neutral scalar and pseudoscalar higgs spectrum of the nmssm , when the @xmath0 lies near its lower mass limit @xmath50 .",
    "the lightest scalar is dominantly singlet @xmath51 , while the doublet scalars are relatively heavy @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand there is often a light pseudoscalar @xmath53 with a very significant doublet component .",
    "consequently a light charged higgs boson of mass @xmath54 gev is expected to decay dominantly via the standard @xmath41 mode .",
    "thus one can probe this mass range via the @xmath55 channel at tevatron and especially at the lhc . on the other hand",
    "a somewhat heavier charged higgs boson @xmath56 can dominantly decay via the @xmath57 channel  @xcite .",
    "in fact this seems to be a very favorable channel to probe for not only @xmath58 but also a light @xmath23 in the moderate @xmath15 region , where the @xmath23 is expected to decay mainly in to the @xmath59 mode .",
    "table  [ tablenmssm ] shows some illustrative samples of nmssm higgs spectra where @xmath58 decays dominantly into the @xmath60 mode .",
    "these results are obtained by scanning the nmssm parameter space .",
    "note that in each case the effective @xmath21 parameter @xmath61 is greater than 100 gev as favored by the lep chargino limit .",
    "the decay branching fractions are shown along with the higgs boson masses and the other model parameters in table  [ tablenmssm ] .",
    "we see indeed that @xmath62 can be substantial .",
    ".[tablenmssm ] examples of dominant @xmath63 decay in the nmssm .",
    "these decay branching fractions are shown along with the higgs boson masses and the other model parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ phaseninty ] shows the behaviour of the @xmath64 , @xmath36 and the br ( @xmath65 ) , for values of @xmath66 corresponding to the above mentioned window in the @xmath2@xmath36 plane , of ref .",
    "it is to be noted here that indeed the @xmath0 is light ( lighter than the top ) over the entire range , making its production in @xmath19 decay possible .",
    "further , the @xmath0 decays dominantly into @xmath67 , with a branching ratio larger than @xmath68 over the entire range where the decay is kinematically allowed , which covers practically the entire parameter range of interest ; viz .",
    "@xmath69 gev for @xmath70 .",
    "it can be also seen from the table that the br(@xmath71 ) is larger than @xmath72 over most of the parameter space of interest .",
    "so not only that @xmath58 can be produced abundantly in the @xmath19 decay giving rise to a possible production channel of @xmath73 through the decay @xmath74 , but this decay mode will be the only decay channel to see a light ( @xmath75 @xmath0 . the traditional decay mode of @xmath76 is suppressed by over an order of magnitude and thus will no longer be viable .",
    "thus the process @xmath77 with the @xmath73 further decaying into a @xmath5 pair and the @xmath78 decaying into a @xmath79 pair will allow a probe of both the light @xmath73 * and * a light @xmath0 in this parameter window in the cp - violating mssm in the cpx scenario .",
    "we have investigated the signal over the entire parameter range of the hole in the @xmath2 @xmath80 plane of the figure  [ lephole ] .",
    "we show our results in figures  [ csec ] and [ corr ] , for common phase @xmath81 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure  [ csec ] the largest signal cross - section case is @xmath82 fb and the signal cross - section is @xmath83 fb for @xmath84 gev .",
    "it is clear from the right panel of the figure  [ corr ] , that there is simultaneous clustering in the @xmath85 distribution around @xmath86 and in the @xmath87 distribution around @xmath88 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the combinatorial background has already been included in the inclusive @xmath5 and @xmath10 invariant mass distributions plotted in right hand panel in figure  [ corr ] whereas the three dimensional plot showing the correlation does not include this .",
    "the clustering feature can be used to distinguish the signal over the standard model background .",
    "technically the most useful in this are the mass window cuts ( @xmath89 gev , @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev on the reconstructed @xmath93 and @xmath0 masses ) employed in the mass reconstruction procedure as described in ref .",
    "as a matter of fact the estimated background coming from the qcd production of @xmath94 once all the cuts ( including the mass window cuts ) are applied , to the signal type events is less than @xmath95 fb , in spite of a starting cross - section of 8.5 pb . the major reduction is brought about by requiring that the invariant mass of the @xmath96 be within @xmath97 gev of @xmath98 .",
    "preliminary studies in atlas collaboration presented at les houches workshop  @xcite also show that this background can be suppressed to negligible levels by similar requirements .",
    "this makes it very clear that the detectability of the signal is controlled primarily by the signal size .",
    "it is also clear from figure  [ csec ] that indeed the signal size is healthy over the regions of interest in the parameter space . thus using this process one can cover the region of the parameter space in @xmath99 mssm , in the @xmath100 plane which can not be excluded by lep-2 and where the tevatron and the lhc have no reach via the usual channels .",
    "note further that this process would be the only channel of discovery for the charged higgs - boson @xmath0 as well in this scenario , as the traditional decay mode of @xmath101 is suppressed by over an order of magnitude .",
    "note further , that the correlation between a light @xmath4 , a moderately light @xmath0 and the large branching ratio for @xmath102 follows in the mssm and in the nmssm , due to some simple sum rules .",
    "hence it may be a generic feature of any scenario , which allows a light charged higgs in spite of the lep - ii constraints , so that @xmath103 is not negligible and further @xmath102 is possible , @xmath4 being a light neutral higgs which dominantly decays into a @xmath5 pair .",
    "thus in conclusion , both in the nmssm and in the cpv - mssm the moderately light charged higgs that is allowed at moderately low values of @xmath2 , provides interesting and novel phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the flavour physics constraints allow a light charged higgs in the mass range that attains in these regions of the parameter space in the two cases .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank the organizers for this wonderful workshop and school held in tehran .",
