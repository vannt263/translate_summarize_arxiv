    "topological insulator ( ti ) has attracted broad interest in recent yearsre-1,re-2 .",
    "the unique property of ti is that the bulk state has a energy gap while the surface state is gapless .",
    "the topological property also have been proposed for three dimensional ( 3d ) semimetalweyl-1,weyl-2,re-3,weyl - response , dsm - rev . up to now , three kinds of topological semimetal have been discovered , i.e. , 3d dirac semimetal ( dsm)@xcite , weyl semimetal ( wsm)weyl-1,weyl-2,hgcr2se4,balets and node - line semimetal ( nls)nsl-1,nsl-2,nsl-3,nsl-4 .",
    "the 3d dsm has four - fold degeneracy point formed by two double degeneracy linear band crossing .",
    "combining the crystal symmetry and time reversal symmetry , 3d dsm can be robust against external perturbations .",
    "based on band structural calculation , several materials have been proposed to be 3d dsm@xcite and some of them already been confirmed by experimentsdsmexp-1,dsmexp-3,dsmexp-4,dsmexp-5 .",
    "if one breaks time reversal symmetry@xcite or inversion symmetryweyl - inver-1,weyl - inver-2,taas , taas - hasan , the double degeneracy bands will split , consequently the 3d dsm evolves into wsm .",
    "very recently , the predictions about wsm in taas family @xcite had been confirmed experimentally @xcite .    unlike dsm and wsm",
    "whose band crossing points distribute at separate @xmath2 points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , for the nls , the crossing points around the fermi level form a closed loop .",
    "several compounds had been proposed as nls included mtc@xcite , bernal graphite@xcite , hyperhoneycomb lattices@xcite and antiperovskite cu@xmath3pdnnsl-3,nsl-4 and cu@xmath3nzn@xcite .",
    "when soc is neglected , for the system with band inversion , time reversal symmetry together with inversion symmetry or mirror symmetry will guarantee node line in 3d bznsl-2,nsl-3,nsl-4,taas , nsl - mat-4,nsl - mat-5 .",
    "same with ti  and wsm , nls also has an characteristic surface state , namely , _",

    "such 2d flat band surface state may become a route to achieve high temperature superconductivity@xcite .    in this article , based on first - principles calculations and effective model analysis , we propose that cate in cscl - type structure is a nls with drumhead like surface flat bands when soc is ignored .",

    "as one member of the alkaline - earth chalcogenides , cate have attracted tremendous interests because of its technological applications ranging from catalysis to luminescencecrystal-1,crystal-2,crystal-3,crystal-4,crystal-5 .",
    "cate undergoes a phase transition from nacl - type structure at ambient conditions to cscl - type structure at hydrostatic pressure about 33 gpa@xcite .",
    "the structure of cate in cscl - type is shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the space group of this phase is @xmath9 ( no .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations have been carried out using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method as implemented in wien2k package @xcite . to obtain accurate band inversion strength and band order , the modified becke - johnson exchange potential together with local - density approximation for the correlation potential ( mbjlda )",
    "has been applied @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff parameter r@xmath10k@xmath11 is set to 7 and a @xmath12 mesh was used for the bz integral .",
    "the soc interaction is included by using the second - order variational procedure .",
    "firstly , we calculate the band structure of cate and show the result without soc in fig .",
    "by checking the wave functions , we find that the valence bands and conduction bands are mainly contributed by 5@xmath13 ( blue ) state of te and 3@xmath14 ( red ) state of ca , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "the band inversion happened at @xmath4 point where the energy of te-5@xmath15 state is higher than the energy of ca-3@xmath14 state by about 0.75 ev .",
    "interestingly , this kind of band inversion is not caused by the soc , which is different from most topological materials@xcite .",
    "we calculate the electronic structure of cate by applying tensile strain to check the origin of band inversion at @xmath4 point .",
    "the energy difference between te-5@xmath13 state and ca-3@xmath14 state decreases as increasing the tensile strain .",
    "we find that when a@xmath161.05a@xmath17 , the band inversion at m point disappear . with the time reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry , the band inversion results in node lines as proved in ref .",

    "the effective hamiltonian of node line around @xmath4 point can be established by using the @xmath21 @xmath22 method .",
    "considering the crystal symmetry at @xmath4 point and time reversal symmetry , the effective hamiltonian can be written as following form:@xmath23where the @xmath24and @xmath25 are pauli matrices , @xmath26 is unit matrix .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath39 confine the node lines in three mutually perpendicular planes ( namely , @xmath40=0 plane , @xmath41=0 plane and @xmath42=0 plane ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "due to the fact that @xmath43 does not equal to zero which breaks the electron - hole symmetry , consequently , the node lines have finite energy dispersion .",
    "when soc is considered , three node lines evolve into two dirac points at @xmath44 line as shown in fig .",
    "at @xmath4 point , the two states near fermi level belong to irreducible representation @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . while along the @xmath19 line , two bands have the same irreducible representation @xmath47as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , thus they can hybridize with each other and open a small gap ( about 50mev ) . for both @xmath48 line and @xmath20 line ,",
    "the two bands around fermi level are also belong to the same irreducible representation , thus there is not band crossing along @xmath18 line and @xmath20 line . since the band splitting is determined by the soc",
    ", thus one can achieve the nls by doping the lighter atoms such as se , s.    along the @xmath0 line , which reserve the @xmath1 rotation symmetry , two states with @xmath45 and @xmath49 at @xmath4 point evolve into @xmath50 and @xmath51 , thus the hybridization between these two bands is forbidden , there is a dirac point as shown in fig.2(b ) .",
    "when the @xmath52 rotational symmetry is broken , like by strain effect , the band crossing point will disappear , and this 3d dsm will become a strong ti with topological indices @xmath5 to be(1;0,0,0 ) .    to understand the band inversion at @xmath4 point and the topological property of this system , we derive a low energy effective hamiltonian at @xmath4 point based on the projection - operator method@xcite .",

    "as mentioned above , the dirac point is on the @xmath0 line , thus it is interesting to discuss the effective model along this line .",

    "the band inversion at @xmath4 point and the dirac nodes in cate suggest the existence of topological nontrivial surface state . to study the surface states in cate we use a 200-unit - cells - thick ( 001 ) slab with top ( bottom ) surface terminated by ca ( te ) atoms . the surface state is then calculated by using the tight - binding method .",

    "when soc is ignored , the system is a nls , and possess nearly flat surface band around the fermi energy . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , our numerical results find that the nearly flat surface `` drumhead '' state appears in the interiors of the projected nodal line rings on the ( 001 ) surface around the @xmath80 point . since the slab we used has two surfaces ,",
    "there are two surface states as shown in the red lines in the fig .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry is broken by nonzero term @xmath81 , thus these two surface bands are not perfect flat with about 70 mev bandwidth .",
    "this type of 2d flat bands are proposed as a novel route to achieve high temperature superconductivitynsl - app-1,nsl - app-2 .",
    "when the soc is included , three node lines are gapped out and become a pair of dirac points along the @xmath0 line , thus the nls become a 3d dsm .",

    "in summary , based on first - principles calculations and effective model analysis , we suggest that cate in cscl - type structure is a nls when soc is ignored .",

    "the effective hamiltonian can be expended as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are function of momentum * k*. @xmath92 are dirac matrices , which can be written as the direct product of @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 are unit matrix @xmath26 and three pauli matrices @xmath97 , @xmath30 and @xmath25 ) .    under the operation of crystal symmetry and time reversal symmetry",
