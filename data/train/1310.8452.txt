    "the main protagonists in this field , lattice qcd and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , have mutually benefited from a cooperation started several years ago .",
    "the emphasis of this cooperation has shifted in recent years . although extrapolation to the physical quark ( and hadron ) masses and finite - volume corrections , both accessible in chpt , are still useful for lattice simulations , improved computing facilities and lattice algorithms allow for simulations with ever smaller quark masses and larger volumes . on the other hand ,",
    "the input of lattice qcd for chpt has become more important over the years to determine the coupling constants of chiral lagrangians , the so - called low - energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "this input is especially welcome for lecs modulating quark mass terms : unlike in phenomenological analyses , quark ( and hadron ) masses can be tuned on the lattice .",

    "the natural expansion parameter ( in the meson sector ) is @xmath9 . to match the precision that lattice studies can attain nowadays , it is therefore mandatory to include nnlo contributions in chpt .",
    "although nnlo amplitudes are available for most quantities of interest for lattice simulations @xcite , there has been a certain reluctance in the lattice community to make full use of those amplitudes for two reasons mainly : for chiral @xmath1 , nnlo amplitudes are usually quite involved and they are mostly available in numerical form only .    in this paper",
    ", we resume our proposal @xcite for large-@xmath0 motivated approximations of nnlo amplitudes that contain one - loop functions only . besides recapitulating the main features of those analytic approximations ,",

    "* we set up numerical criteria for the amplitudes to qualify as acceptable approximations .",
    "those criteria can be checked by comparing with available numerical results making use of the full nnlo amplitudes for some given sets of meson masses . *",
    "the proposed approximation includes all terms leading and next - to - leading order in large @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , it contains all chiral logs , independently of the large-@xmath0 counting . in order to meet the numerical criteria just mentioned",

    "our numerical fits of lattice data are not intended to compete with actual lattice results for obvious reasons .",
    "instead , we hope to encourage lattice groups to use nnlo amplitudes that are much simpler than the full amplitudes and yet offer considerably more insight than , e.g. , polynomial fits .",
