    "optoelectronic oscillators ( oeos ) combine a nonlinear modulation of laser light with optical storage to generate ultra - pure microwaves for lightwave telecommunication and radar applications @xcite",
    ". their principal specificity is their extremely low phase noise , which can be as low as @xmath0  dbrad@xmath1/hz at @xmath2  khz from a @xmath2  ghz carrier . despite some interesting preliminary investigations ,",
    "the theoretical determination of phase noise in oeos is still a partially unsolved problem .",
    "the qualitative features of this phase noise spectrum can be recovered using some heuristical guidelines or rough approximations , but however , a rigorous theoretical background is still lacking .",
    "there are several reasons which can explain that absence of theoretical background .",
    "a first reason is that before refs .",
    "@xcite , there was no time domain model to describe such systems , so that stochastic analysis could not be used to perform the phase noise study .",
    "moreover , unlike most of oscillators , the oeo is a delay - line oscillator , and very few had been done to study the effect phase noise on time - delay induced limit - cycles .",
    "finally , the oeo is subjected to multiple noise sources , which are sometimes non - white , like the flicker ( also referred to as  @xmath3 \" ) noise which is predominant around the microwave carrier .",
    "the objective of this work is to propose a theoretical study where all these features are taken into account .",
    "the plan of the article is the following . in section [ phasediffusion ] ,",
    "we present the phase diffusion approach in autonomous systems .",
    "it is a brief review where the fundamental concepts of phase diffusion are recalled , and where some important earlier contributions are highlighted .",
    "then , we derive in section [ phasesdde ] a stochastic delay - differential equation for the phase noise study .",
    "we show that for our purpose , the global interaction of noise with the system can be decomposed into two contributions , namely an additive and a multiplicative noise contribution .",
    "section [ belowth ] is devoted to the study of the noise spectrum below threshold .",
    "it will appear that the spectrum below threshold will not only be important to validate the stochastic model , but also that it enables an accurate calibration of additive noise . in section [ aboveth ] , we address the problem of phase noise when there is a microwave output using fourier analysis , and we show that it is possible to have an accurate image of the phase noise spectrum in all frequency ranges . the last section concludes the article .",
    "for an ideal ( noise - free ) oscillator , the fourier spectrum is a collection of dirac peaks , standing for the fundamental frequency and its harmonics .",
    "the effect of amplitude white noise is to add a flat background , while the peaks do keep their zero linewidth ; it is the effect of phase noise to widen the linewidth of these peaks .",
    "some pioneering papers on the topic of phase noise in autonomous oscillators using stochastic calculus had been published forty years ago @xcite . in particular , it was demonstrated that a general framework to study the problem of phase noise in a self - sustained oscillator could be built using some minimalist assumptions .",
    "the first point is that a strong nonlinearity is an essential necessity in oscillators , in the sense that nonlinearity can not be regarded as small because it controls the operating level of the oscillator .",
    "the second important point is that the phase is only _ neutrally _ stable , so that quasilinear methods which assume that fluctuations from some operating point are small ( linearization techniques ) can not be applied _ directly_.    the phase is neutrally stable as a consequence of the phase - invariance of autonomous oscillators . in other words , limit - cycles are stable against amplitude perturbations , while there is no mechanism able to stabilize the phase to a given value : hence , phase perturbations are undamped , but they do not diverge exponentially , though . in a noise free oscillator ,",
    "the  stroboscopic \" state point on the limit - cycle is immobile , but in the presence of noise , it moves randomly along the limit - cycle : in other words , the phase of the oscillator undergoes a _ diffusion _ process , in all points similar to a one - dimensional brownian motion . in the most simple case ,",
    "the random fluctuations of the phase are referred to as a _ wiener process _ , obeying an equation of the kind @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a gaussian white noise with autocorrelation @xmath6 , while @xmath7 is a parameter referred to as the _ diffusion constant_. it can be demonstrated that the phase variance diverges linearly as @xmath8 , and the single - side band phase noise spectrum ( in dbc / hz ) explicitly reads @xmath9 $ ] , so that @xmath7 is the unique parameter characterizing all the statistical and spectral features of phase fluctuations .     experimental set - up.,width=226 ]      on the base of earlier works by lax @xcite and krtner @xcite , demir , mehrota and roychowdhury have proposed few years ago a unifying theory of phase noise in self - sustained oscillators subjected to white noise sources @xcite .",
    "their approach , which had later been extended by demir to the case colored noise sources @xcite , relies on stochastic calculus .",
    "the principal point of their contribution was the introduction of a decomposition of phase and amplitude noise through a projection onto the periodic time - varying eigenvectors ( the so called _ floquet eigenvectors _ ; also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and they proved that it provides the correct solution to the problem .",
    "demir _ et al _ have shown that if the sources of noise are gaussian and white , the phase noise around the fundamental peak ( and its harmonics ) has a lorentzian lineshape , and therefore is fully determined by an  effective \" diffusion constant @xmath10 which is the unique parameter needed for the phase noise determination . however",
    ", if the demir _ et al _ theory has the great and essential advantage of mathematical rigorousness , its principal drawback is that exactitude is obtained at the expense of simplicity : the calculation of @xmath10 is very complex , as it requires an accurate determination of all the time - varying eigenvectors related to the autonomous flow . in general this task can only be performed numerically using quite complicated algorithms , and this lack of flexibility explains why this method is scarcely used in the phase noise studies available in the literature .",
    "the key challenge for the study of phase noise in oeo would be provide an accurate description of the phase noise spectrum , while avoiding the determination of floquet eigenvectors , which is an extremely complicated task in delayed system .",
    "the oeo under study is organized in a single - loop architecture as depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",

    "@xmath29 all optical and electrical losses are gathered in a single attenuation factor @xmath30 .",
