    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations have provided crucial insights into the origin and evolution of present structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "physical processes occurred before , during and after recombination have left distinctive signatures on the cmb .",
    "the most prominent feature is a sequence of peaks and dips in the anisotropy power spectrum , the remnant imprints of acoustic waves propagating in the primordial photon - baryon plasma at the time of decoupling @xcite .",
    "this oscillatory pattern carries specific information on several cosmological parameters @xcite . as an example",
    "the angular scale at which these oscillations are observed provides a distance measurement of the last scattering surface to the sound horizon at decoupling , hence a clean test of cosmic curvature @xcite .",
    "wmap observations have accurately detected the peak structure of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "these data have constrained the geometry of the universe to be nearly flat and have precisely determined other cosmological parameters @xcite . on the other hand constraints on dark energy",
    "are less stringent , this is because its late time effects leave a weaker imprint of the cmb which is diluted by degeneracies with other parameters .",
    "indeed other cosmological tests can be more sensitive to the signature of dark energy , nonetheless they still require additional information from cmb to break the parameter degeneracies .",
    "as an example cmb constraints are usually combined with those from sn ia luminosity distance data . alternatively the cmb can be used in combination with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "in fact the same acoustic signature present in the cmb is also imprinted in the large scale distribution of galaxy , thus providing a complementary probe of cosmic distances at lower redshifts .",
    "a likelihood analysis of the cmb spectra is certainly the more robust approach to implement cmb constraints with those from other datasets .",
    "this can be very time consuming , henceforth one can try to compress the cmb information in few measurable and easily computable quantities .",
    "recent literature has focused on the use of the shift parameter @xmath4 , and the multipole of the acoustic scale at decoupling @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however these quantities are not directly measured by cmb observations , they are inferred as secondary parameters from the cosmological constraints obtained from the full cmb likelihood analysis .",
    "consequently their use as _ data _ can potentially lead to results which suffer of model dependencies as well as prior parameter assumptions made in the analysis from which the values of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) have been inferred in the first place . in contrast the multipole location of the cmb extrema can be directly determined from the observed temperature power spectrum through model - independent curve fitting .",
    "these measurements can then be used to constrain cosmological parameters provide that pre - recombination corrections are properly taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we analyse in detail the cosmological information encoded in the position of the cmb extrema as measured by wmap .",
    "our aim is to provide a simple and unbiased method for incorporating cmb constraints into other datasets which is alternative to that of using @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "firstly we estimate the amplitude of pre - recombination mechanisms that can displace the location of the cmb extrema with the respect to the angular scale of the sound horizon at decoupling .",
    "in particular we show that the wmap location of the first peak is strongly affected by such mechanisms , while the displacements induced on the higher peaks and dips are smaller . by accounting for these effects",
    "we perform a cosmological parameter analysis and infer constraints on dark energy under different prior assumptions , including the cosmic curvature .",
    "we then combine these results with measurements of bao from sdss and 2df data @xcite , and confront the inferred constraints with those obtained using sn ia data from the supernova legagy survey @xcite .",
    "finally we test for potential model dependencies of @xmath4 ( and @xmath5 ) by performing a full likelihood analysis of the wmap spectra for different sets of cosmological parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ peaks ] we review the physics of the cmb acoustic oscillations . in section  [ wmap ]",
    "we discuss the relative shifts of the multipoles of the wmap peaks and dips . in section  [ cosmo ] we present the results of the cosmological parameter inference using the location of the cmb extrema in combination with bao . in section  [ sndata ]",
    "we confront the results with the sn ia likelihood analysis from the snls sample .",
    "we discuss the results on the shift parameter in section  [ shift ] and present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the onset of acoustic waves on the sub - horizon scales of the tightly coupled photon - baryon plasma before recombination is natural consequence of photon pressure resisting gravitational collapse .",
    "the properties of these oscillations depends both on the background expansion and the evolution of the gravitational potentials associated with the perturbations present in the system . in the following",
    "we will briefly review the basic processes which affect the propagation of these waves before decoupling .",
    "interested readers will find more detailed discussions in @xcite .",
    "let consider the photon temperature fluctuation @xmath6 ( monopole ) , following hu and sugiyama @xcite its evolution is described by @xmath7 where the dot is the derivative with respect to conformal time , @xmath8 is the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath9 is the wavenumber , @xmath10 is the sound speed of the system with @xmath11 the speed of light .",
    "the source term @xmath12 represents a driving force , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the gauge - invariant metric perturbations respectively .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ monoeq ] ) that the homogeneous equation ( @xmath15 ) admits oscillating solutions of the form , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are set by the initial conditions and @xmath19 is the sound horizon at time @xmath20 . at time of decoupling @xmath21 ,",
    "the positive and negative extrema of these oscillations appear as a series of peaks in the anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "their location in the multipole space is a multiple integer of the inverse of the angle subtended by the sound horizon scale at decoupling , namely @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the recombination redshift and @xmath26 the comoving distance to @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 the hubble constant , @xmath30 with @xmath31 the constant curvature , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , and @xmath35 .",
    "scales for which the monopole vanishes also contribute to anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "in such a case the signal comes from the non - vanishing photon velocity @xmath36 ( dipole ) which oscillates with a phase shifted by @xmath37 with the respect to the monopole @xcite .",
    "therefore photons coming from these regions are responsible for a series of troughs in the anisotropy power spectrum at multipoles @xmath38 with @xmath39 .    the full solution to eq .",
    "( [ monoeq ] ) at decoupling reads as @xcite :    @xmath40^{3/4 } sin{[k r_s(\\eta _ * ) - k r_s(\\eta')]}f(\\eta'),\\\\ \\label{fullsol}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is set by the initial conditions . as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ fullsol ] ) including the driving force @xmath42 induces a scale dependent phase shift of the acoustic oscillations , which is primarily caused by the time variation of the gravitational potential @xmath13 .",
    "in fact perturbations on scales which enter the horizon at the matter - radiation equality experience a variation of the expansion rate which causes a time evolution of the associated gravitational potentials . this mechanism is dominant on the large scales and is responsible for the so called early integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "the overall effect is to displace the acoustic oscillations with the respect to the pure harmonic series . for a spectrum of adiabatic perturbations",
    "we may expect this displacement to become negligible on higher harmonics since the gravitational potentials decay as @xmath43 on scales well inside the horizon .",
    "this is not the case if active perturbations were present on such scales before the epoch of decoupling .    in order to account for these pre - recombination effects a realistic modeling of the multipole position of the cmb maxima and minima",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 for peaks , and @xmath46 for dips ; @xmath47 parametrizes the displacement caused by the driving force .",
    "because of the scale dependent nature of the driving effect discussed above , it is convenient to decompose the correction term as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the overall shift of the first peak with respect to the sound horizon , and @xmath50 is the shift of the m - th extrema relative to the first peak @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that while the position of the cmb extrema depends through @xmath5 on the geometry and late time expansion of the universe , their relative spacing depends through @xmath47 only on pre - recombination physics .",
    "wmap observations have provided an accurate determination of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the multipoles of the cmb extrema have been inferred using a functional fit to the uncorrelated band powers as described in @xcite .",
    "hinshaw et al .",
    "@xcite have applied this method to the wmap-3yr data and found the position of the first two peaks and dips to be at @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "we want to determine whether these measurements provide any evidence for driving effects affecting the acoustic oscillations . in order to do",
    "so we evaluate the relative spacings between the wmap measured @xmath55-th and @xmath56-th extrema , @xmath57 and the propagated errors @xmath58 .    , @xmath59 and @xmath60 relative to @xmath61 ( black solid circles ) and propagated errors .",
    "the values expected from the harmonic series are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( open circles ) .",
    "vertical dashed lines delimit the expected interval of variation of the relative spacings obtained by including the shift corrections as parametrized in @xcite and evaluated over a conservative range of cosmological parameter values ( see text ) .",
    "the dotted vertical lines include the effect of three massless neutrinos . ]",
    "let first consider the spacings relative to the location of the first peak .",
    "we find @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "these estimates are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ( black solid circles ) , where we also plot the relative spacings as expected from a sequence of perfect acoustic oscillations ( open circles ) .",
    "it is evident that the wmap inferred values of @xmath68 lie many sigmas away from those expected from the harmonic series .",
    "this provides clear evidence that the position of the first peak is largely affected by the driving force at decoupling .",
    "such a large displacement is most likely caused by the early isw , although an additional contribution from isocurvature fluctuations @xcite or active gravitational potentials @xcite can not be excluded .",
    "let focus now on the displacement of the second peak relative to the first one , since @xmath69 it follows that @xmath70 .",
    "this implies that the overall shift of @xmath61 with the respect to @xmath5 is larger than the shift of @xmath59 relative to @xmath61 . as discussed in the previous section",
    "this is consistent with having the gravitational potentials inside the sound horizon scaling as @xmath43 , thus inducing a weaker driving force .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig2 ] where we plot @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .     for @xmath74 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 relative spacings .",
    "the harmonic series values are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . ]",
    "apart @xmath78 , whose value suggests the presence of a non - negligible driving effect still on the scale of the first dip , we may notice that all other spacings are statistically consistent with the prediction of the harmonic series .",
    "therefore these results suggest the existence of a scale dependent phase shift of the cmb acoustic oscillations . the effect is larger on the scale of the first acoustic peak , while it is weaker for the higher harmonics .",
    "the upcoming planck mission will map more accurately the location of the higher peaks and dips and provide a cleaner detection of this shift .    indeed driving effects",
    "are well accounted for by the cmb theory as incorporated in standard boltzmann codes @xcite .",
    "for instance a standard adiabatic spectrum of initial density perturbations leads to phase shifts which are consistent with those we have inferred here . to show this we have used the fitting formulas provided in @xcite for adiabatic models which parametrize @xmath47 in terms of the total matter density @xmath79 , the baryon density @xmath80 , the dark energy density at decoupling @xmath81 and the scalar spectral index @xmath82 .",
    "assuming @xmath83 we evaluate these formulas over the following range of parameter values , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and infer the corresponding intervals for the relative spacings @xmath87 .",
    "these are drawn in figure  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] as vertical dashed lines .",
    "it can be seen that these intervals are statistically consistent with the measured spacings . including the contribution of three massless neutrinos ( dotted vertical lines ) slightly shifts the @xmath68 intervals further from the expected values of the perfect harmonic oscillator .",
    "this is because the presence of relativistic neutrinos extend the radiation era and therefore leads to a more effective early isw effect on the large scales .",
    "in contrast we find no differences for the intervals of the other peaks and dips spacings .",
    "we perform a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) likelihood analysis to derive cosmological parameter constraints using the measurements of the wmap extrema discussed in the previous section",
    ". again we account for the shift corrections by evaluating the model prediction for @xmath88 using eq .",
    "( [ lm ] ) , with the displacements @xmath47 parametrized as in @xcite .",
    "we compute the recombination redshift @xmath25 using the fitting formulae provided in @xcite .",
    "cosmological constraints derived from the location of the cmb peaks have been presented in previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "our aim is to derive bounds on dark energy which are independent of supernova ia data and rely only on the cosmic distance information encoded in the angular scale of the sound horizon as inferred from the multipole position of the wmap peaks and dips , and bao measurements .    first we consider flat models with dark energy parametrized by a constant equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "we then test the stability of the inferred constraints by extending the analysis to models with non - vanishing curvature , @xmath89 .",
    "we also consider flat dark energy models with a time varying equation of state parametrized as @xmath90 ( cpl ) @xcite .",
    "we want to remark that for models with @xmath91 , the dark energy density can be non - negligible at early times . therefore in order to consistently account for the shifts induced on the location of the cmb peaks and dips , we compute for each model in the chain the corresponding value of @xmath81 so as to include its value in the shifts fitting formulae .",
    "the credible intervals on the parameters of interest are inferred after marginalizing over @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "we let them vary in the following intervals : @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "marginalizing over these parameters is necessary due to the parameter degeneracies in @xmath97 , @xmath98 and to properly account for the shift corrections @xmath47 .    as complementary dataset we use the cosmic distance as inferred from the bao in the sdss and 2df surveys @xcite .",

    "@xcite have found , @xmath103 .    in order to reduce the degeneracy with the hubble parameter we also infer constraints assuming a gaussian hst prior @xmath104 @xcite . in figure  [ fig3 ]",

    "we now discuss these results in more detail .",
    "as it can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ] ( upper left panel ) the cmb extrema alone poorly constrain the @xmath110 plane . in particular the @xmath105 and @xmath1 regions are larger than those obtained from the wmap analysis @xcite .",
    "this is because due to the late isw effect more information about dark energy is contained in the full cmb spectrum than just in the distance to the last scattering surface as encoded in the position of the cmb peaks and dips .",
    "besides several degeneracies with other parameters are strongly reduced .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that our limits on @xmath0 are unbounded from below .",
    "after marginalizing over all parameters we find @xmath111 and @xmath112 at @xmath1 .",
    "a model with @xmath113 is consistent at @xmath114 confidence level with the location of the wmap extrema provided that @xmath115 .",

    "the upper limit on @xmath0 improves if a strong prior on @xmath118 and @xmath82 is assumed ( dotted contours in the upper left panel ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] we plot the @xmath105 and @xmath1 contours inferred from a mcmc likelihood analysis of the wmap-3yrs spectra in combination with the hst prior .",
    "the limits are more stringent than in the previous case .",
    "this is because the amplitude of the first peak as well as the relative amplitude of the other peaks are particularly sensitive to @xmath106 , @xmath122 and @xmath92 .",
    "hence degeneracies contributing to the uncertainties in the @xmath110 plane are further reduced . as mentioned before",
    ", a robust dark energy parameter inference needs the analysis of the full cmb spectrum .",
    "however in the case one aims to infer constraints from other datasets such as sn ia or bao and include cmb information in a rapid and simple manner , the position of the cmb extrema provides a very efficient tool .",
    "in fact while the cmb power spectrum analysis requires the solution of the boltzmann equation for a given cosmological model , the evaluation of the position of the cmb peaks and dips only is a semi - analytical computation .",
    "as an example running publicly available boltzamann codes @xcite on a cpu at @xmath123 requires about one minute to compute the spectra of a single model , and even using an mcmc sampling the overall likelihood analysis still require about one hour to reach full convergence of the mcmc chains , while using the cmb extrema only takes few minutes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( central upper panel ) we extend our analysis of the cmb peaks and dips to non - flat models . allowing for a non - vanishing curvature increases the geometric degeneracy and consequently leads to larger uncertainties in @xmath0 .",

    "marginalizing we find @xmath126 and @xmath127 at @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for increasing values of @xmath109 , dark energy becomes dominant at earlier times .",
    "in such a case the presence of a non - negligible dark energy density at recombination modifies the position of the cmb peaks and dips primarily through its effect on the size of the sound horizon at decoupling .",
    "therefore the location of the cmb extrema ( after having accouted for the relative shifts ) can put an upper bound on the time evolution of the equation of state at high redshifts ( i.e. @xmath109 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that in order to be consistent with the observed peak structure , large positive values of @xmath91 are excluded ( see also section  [ sndata ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the analysis of the full cmb spectrum limits the amount of dark energy density at recombination to be less than @xmath128 ( otherwise it would strongly affect the amplitude and location of the cmb doppler oscillations ) , hence providing a stringent upper bounds on the value of the dark energy equation of state at early time ( see @xcite ) . in contrast models with large negative values of @xmath129",
    "leave no imprint at high redshifts , since in this case the dark energy density rapidly decreases for @xmath130 .",
    "consequently the likelihood remains unbounded in this region of the parameter space .",

    "this is because sn ia observations by testing the luminosity distance over a range of redshift where the universe evolves from a matter dominated expansion to one driven by dark energy , are sensitive to at least one dark energy parameter ( i.e. @xmath0 or @xmath108 ) @xcite .",
    "in such a case adding external information breaks the internal degeneracy and leads to finite bounds on both dark energy parameters .",

    "therefore unless the evolution of the linear perturbations is understood well enough as to allow for a precise calculation of the cmb and matter power spectra , the use @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or alternatively of the position of the cmb extrema or the distance measurements from bao might expose to the risk of completely wrong results .",
    "the multipoles of the cmb extrema can be directly measured from the wmap spectra and used to combine cmb information with other cosmological datasets .",
    "corrections to the location of the cmb peaks and dips from pre - recombination effects need to be taken into account for an unbiased parameter inference . here",
    "we have shown that the position of the first peak as measured by wmap-3yrs data is strongly displaced with the respect to the actual location of the acoustic horizon at recombination .",
    "this displacement is caused by gravitational driving forces affecting the propagation of sound waves before recombination .",
    "these effects are smaller on higher harmonics , indicating the presence of a scale dependent phase shift which becomes negligible on scales well inside the horizon .",
    "we have performed a cosmological parameter inference using the position of the wmap peaks and dips in combination with recent bao measurements and derived constraints on a constant dark energy equation of state under different model parameter assumptions .",
    "the method we have presented here is alternative to using the shift parameter @xmath4 and/or the multipole of the acoustic horizon at decoupling @xmath5 .",
    "we have tested for potential model dependencies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 by running a full cmb spectra likelihood analysis for different class of models .",
    "indeed for simple dark energy models the inferred constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 do not differ from those inferred assuming the vanilla @xmath133cdm .",
    "nevertheless we have suggested caution in using these secondary parameters as _ data _ , since hidden assumptions may lead to biased results particularly when testing models which greatly depart from the @xmath133cdm cosmology .",
    "indeed we do advocate the use of the full cmb spectra , particularly for constraining the properties of dark energy .",
    "in fact more information on dark energy is encoded in the full cmb spectrum than just in the distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "nevertheless we think that using the location of the cmb extrema provide a fast and self - consistent approach for combining in a friendly user way the cmb information with complementary cosmological data .",
    "psc is grateful to the aspen center for physics for the hospitality during the `` supernovae as cosmological distance indicators '' workshop where part of this work has been developped .",
    "we are particularly thankful to jean - michel alimi , laura covi , michael doran , malcom fairbarn , jan hamann , martin kunz , julien larena , eric linder , yun wang and martin white for discussions , suggestions and help .",

    "<S> on the other hand we infer larger limits for non - flat cosmologies . from the full cmb likelihood analysis we also estimate the values of the shift parameter @xmath4 and the multipole @xmath5 of the acoustic horizon at decoupling for several cosmologies to test their dependence on model assumptions . </S>",
