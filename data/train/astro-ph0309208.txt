    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; @xcite ) are formed when the low - mass stellar companion of a wd , exposed during a common envelope event , finally ( on timescales of @xmath7 gyr ) fills the roche lobe as a result of long term angular momentum losses .",
    "the wd will cool during this time ; a @xmath8 he wd would have @xmath9 at 4 gyr @xcite , whereas a @xmath5 c / o wd would have @xmath10 in 4 gyr @xcite .",
    "these wds have effective temperatures @xmath11 k just before mass transfer starts .",
    "however , once the roche lobe is filled , the wd accretes material at @xmath12 ( e.g.howell , nelson , & rappaport 2001 ) and can be reheated @xcite to higher @xmath3 s .",
    "dwarf novae ( dn ) are the subset of cvs with low time - averaged rates @xmath13 and thermally unstable accretion disks .",
    "the transfer of matter onto the wd occurs in outbursts that last a few days to a week once every month to year ( or even longer in some systems ) .",
    "most dn have orbital periods @xmath14 hours , below the `` period gap '' , with fewer above the gap ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during accretion disk quiescence",
    ", the @xmath15 onto the wd is often low enough that the system s uv ( and sometimes optical ) emission is dominated by light from the wd surface , allowing for a measurement of the wd @xmath3 , nearly all of which exceed @xmath16 k @xcite .",
    "thus , the wd is hotter than expected for its age , providing evidence of the thermal impact of prolonged accretion on the wd @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ) have calculated @xmath3 and its dependence on @xmath1 , the wd mass , @xmath17 , and core temperature , @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we now use that work to constrain these parameters from the measured @xmath3 s .",
    "the gravitational energy released when a particle falls from a large distance to the stellar surface ( @xmath19 ) is deposited near the photosphere and is rapidly radiated away .",
    "this energy does not penetrate inwards with the inflowing material , as the time it takes the fluid to move inward is much longer than the time it takes for heat to escape .",
    "this eliminates the outer boundary condition and instead points to the importance of energy release deep in the accreting h / he envelope due to both gravitational energy release and a low level of nuclear `` simmering '' .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : review ] by reviewing our work and showing that the best constrained quantity from a measured @xmath3 is @xmath20 . at very low @xmath1 s",
    ", @xmath3 also depends on @xmath18 .",
    "however , in this regime , we can calculate @xmath18 self consistently , removing it from consideration .",
    "in  [ sec : measurements ] the @xmath21 s implied by the available measurements are presented and compared to cv evolutionary scenarios .",
    "a detailed comparison is presented for dn with @xmath22 hours , showing that the observed @xmath23 s imply that either @xmath24 or @xmath1 is larger than implied by gravitational radiation losses alone .",
    "we close in  [ sec : conclusion ] with a discussion of future work , especially the seismology of accreting wds .",
    "the high quality uv spectra of quiescent dn from the stis instrument on _ hubble space telescope _ ,",
    "e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and many of the references in the table appearing in @xcite , yield accurate measurements of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the lack of accurate distance information prohibits the measurement of the wd radius , and hence mass , motivating the identification of a physical parameter which is best constrained by @xmath3 alone .",
    "the intent of this section is to demonstrate that , without knowledge of @xmath25 or @xmath17 , the best constrained parameter is the accretion rate per unit area , @xmath21 .",
    "our previous work presented a detailed discussion of the impact of accretion on the thermal structure of a wd .",
    "for this paper we are primarily interested in the predictions for the surface luminosity , @xmath26 , for which we showed that the strongest dependence is @xmath27 and thus @xmath28 , even for different masses .",
    "the prime variance in this simple mapping is from the change in @xmath3 as the mass of the accumulated layer , @xmath29 , increases between classical novae ( cn ) . in discussing our theoretical results",
    "we use the @xmath3 range for @xmath30 , which represents where an observed wd is most likely to be found .",
    "we set @xmath31 throughout as the difference between this and similar predictions for @xmath32 is less than the uncertainty due to the unknown @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : teff - mdot ] shows the range of @xmath3 traversed as a function of @xmath21 for @xmath33-@xmath34 , showing that @xmath3 provides a reasonable constraint on @xmath21 even when @xmath17 is not known .",
    "a @xmath35 k implies that @xmath36 g @xmath37 s@xmath38 , whereas a @xmath39 k implies that @xmath40 g @xmath37 s@xmath38 .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath41 to @xmath17 is the strongest qualitative difference between our calculation and sion s ( 1995 ) estimate of @xmath42 , made from the steady state models of @xcite .",
    "while iben s ( 1982 ) models are steady state in the sense of @xmath43 , they were for high accretion rates , @xmath44 yr@xmath38 for the best discussed models , with one at @xmath45 yr@xmath38 , and use steadily burning shells .",
    "such a steady state is inappropriate at the low @xmath1 s discussed here , where the burning is always unstable .",
    "iben s ( 1982 ) models are also qualitatively very different from ours : in our models compressional energy released in the accreted h / he shell provides the outgoing luminosity and helps to establish the equilibrium configuration of the core , whereas in iben s ( 1982 ) models , the compressional heating term is entirely in the core , a contribution which is likely small ( see appendix a of ) .",
    "the results of tb are complementary to @xcite , which focuses on the response of the wd to the short - timescale @xmath15 variations during dn outbursts .",
    "the last parameter dependence to explore is @xmath18 , the wd core temperature . as discussed in , dn below the period gap",
    "have adequate time to reach an equilibrium core temperature , @xmath46 , that depends on @xmath1 and @xmath17 .",
    "however , dn above the period gap have not been accreting long enough for @xmath18 to reach @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig : tcdemo ] shows how the traversed @xmath3 range depends on @xmath18 for a @xmath47 wd .",
    "the curves show @xmath3 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . due to a strong core / envelope decoupling for @xmath51 yr@xmath38 ,",
    "the @xmath3 range is nearly independent of @xmath18 . for lower @xmath1",
    "s , the wd core temperature should be close to the equilibrium value , allowing us to use @xmath52 as representative when finding @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : mdot - porb_wide ] shows the @xmath53 s inferred from the measured @xmath3 s tabulated in @xcite , with the following modifications : for wx cet and vy aqr we use the single - temperature fitted values , for cu vel we correct the misquoted value , for al com we use a measurement longer after superoutburst @xcite , and we add gw lib @xcite and dw uma @xcite .",
    "this observational @xmath53-@xmath54 relation shows clear evidence for a drop in @xmath53 below the period gap .",
    "the relationship between @xmath54 and @xmath1 is still a very active area of theoretical inquiry and one that we hope our work can illuminate .",
    "the expectations from `` standard '' cv evolution @xcite for @xmath47 ( solid line ) and @xmath55 ( dashed line ) are shown in figure 2 . in this disrupted magnetic braking scenario , @xmath1 is set by magnetic braking above the period gap and by gravitational radiation below the period gap .",
    "our deduced @xmath53 s are lower than the expected values above the period gap .",
    "it is important that we are inferring the long - term @xmath1 , averaged over the thermal time of the radiative ( nondegenerate ) layer @xmath56 years for @xmath57 , so that this discrepancy can not be due to a temporarily low @xmath15 .",
    "although selection effects favor low @xmath1 s above the period gap , since such systems are more likely to have clean wd spectra , patterson s ( 1984 ) estimates of @xmath1 for the systems above the gap in figure [ fig : mdot - porb_wide ] are not systematically below his estimates for other cvs .",
    "the most recently improved calibration of the magnetic braking law , using spin - down of open cluster stars @xcite , yielded @xmath1 s above the period gap at least a factor of ten lower than howell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , falling below our inferences , so that braking in cvs must be enhanced over that responsible for the spin down of noninteracting low mass stars .    in figure 2",
    ", we also show patterson s ( 1984 ) deduction from observations , @xmath58 yr@xmath38 , for @xmath47 ( dotted line ) and @xmath59 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "our points are consistent with @xcite above the period gap , within the uncertainty in his estimates . below the gap , however , our measurements are roughly a factor of 3 above his",
    ". the @xcite estimates also suffer from the absence of reliable distances , but in a more direct way than ours , making systematic errors difficult to quantify .",
    "the best quality data are for cvs below the period gap , and @xcite and @xcite provide examples of these measurements with a discussion of how the uncertainty in the surface gravity , @xmath60 , affects the @xmath3 results .",
    "we display our predictions for the @xmath3 ranges along with observed values for @xmath6 hrs in figure [ fig : teff - porb ] .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath54 relation expected from gravitational radiation losses for @xmath47 is from @xcite , and we use the same mass - radius relation for the donor to find @xmath1-@xmath54 for @xmath61 .",
    "this gives @xmath62 and @xmath63 yr@xmath38 for @xmath33 and @xmath59 respectively at @xmath64 hours .",
    "due to a difference in the donor mass - radius relation , these differ slightly from the values of @xcite shown in figure [ fig : mdot - porb_wide ] , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 yr@xmath38 for @xmath33 and @xmath55 at @xmath64 hours .",
    "the @xmath3 measurements shown by circles are again from the table in @xcite ( with the modifications discussed earlier ) .",
    "the error bars indicate systematic errors due to the unknown wd mass , as the spectral fits can not independently constrain @xmath3 and @xmath60 , and represent the range of @xmath3 obtained for @xmath67 ( @xmath68-@xmath69 ) .",
    "all spectral measurements of these cv wd @xmath3 s are subject to this same uncertainty .",
    "the data with displayed error bars are the _ best _ measurements , and others have similar or larger uncertainies .",
    "the diamonds show @xmath3 for magnetic systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated masses for the two magnetic systems at 1.9 hours are 0.5 and @xmath5 @xcite , for the lower and higher respectively , placing their measured @xmath3 very close to that expected from our work .",
    "when the wd mass , and thus radius , is known , @xmath1 can be directly constrained .",
    "the filled points are systems which have relatively secure wd masses from eclipse timing ( patterson 2001 ) , in order of increasing @xmath54 and in units of @xmath70 the masses are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for wz sge , oy car , ht cas , and z cha .",
    "the best @xmath3 measurement is that for wz sge @xcite giving @xmath75 yr@xmath38 where the first errors represent the unconstrained value of @xmath29 and the second the uncertain mass .",
    "if the gravitational radiation prediction of @xmath1 @xcite is taken as a lower limit , then comparison of these cvs to the predicted @xmath3 s of figure [ fig : teff - porb ] yield a maximum wd mass .",
    "for example , none of the cvs denoted with filled circles can have @xmath17 in excess of @xmath76 , since a more massive wd would yield a higher @xmath3 than observed .",
    "if the current @xmath1-@xmath54 relation predicted from gravitational radiation is correct , this comparison favors wd masses near @xmath77 .",
    "however , the systems with measured masses indicate another possible interpretation , that @xmath78 for many systems but @xmath1 is slightly greater than that predicted by @xcite .",
    "the fact that the lower bound of measured values lies roughly parallel to what is expected for post - turnaround objects provides the exciting possibility that the turnaround is at roughly @xmath79 hours and the objects with the lowest @xmath3 values , hv vir and eg cnc , are post - turnaround cvs . under this interpretation",
    ", our work would indicate that the @xmath1 s for these post - turnaround objects are much higher than that expected from current modelling of evolution under the influence of gravitational radiation .",
    "such an `` extra '' angular momentum loss has been mentioned by @xcite as a way to understand the location of the period minimum .",
    "we have used our theoretical work on accreting wds @xcite to translate measurements of cv wd @xmath3 s into measurements of @xmath80 , the accretion rate per unit wd surface area averaged over the thermal time of the radiative envelope ( @xmath81 years ) . since the predictions of for @xmath82 are insensitive to @xmath18 ( except where its value can be found self - consistently ) we allowed for a range of wd masses , @xmath83-@xmath34 , and accumulated envelope masses , @xmath30 , to obtain a well - quantified uncertainty on @xmath84 from the observed @xmath3 .",
    "we find evidence that above the period gap ( @xmath85 hours ) dn accretion rates are slightly overestimated by cv evolution models @xcite , but that angular momentum loss is quite enhanced compared to spin down of isolated low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "below the period gap , @xmath86 hours , we find that @xmath1 is larger than that predicted by current models of gravitational radiation losses @xcite when @xmath47 , indicating either larger @xmath17 or higher @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that an isolated wd will pulsate when its @xmath23 is in the approximate range 11000 - 12000 k @xcite .",
    "while a difference in the outer atmospheric composition , h / he in an accreting wd versus pure hydrogen in the isolated case , will shift this range , it is likely that a similar pulsation mechanism will be active in accreting wds .",
    "our calculations indicate that accreting wds with @xmath33-@xmath59 should be near this range when @xmath87 few@xmath88 yr@xmath38 .",
    "this @xmath1 is typical of that expected in cvs when accretion is driven by gravitational radiation losses , @xmath89 hours @xcite . in fact one system , gw lib , has been found which does exhibit precisely this type of variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . using the interior models developed in",
    ", we are now undertaking a seismological study of these systems .",
    "this offers the tantalizing possibility of measuring the wd mass , spin and mass of the accumulated h / he layer .",
    "since the minimum light of @xmath90 dn in quiescence is determined by the hot wd , we can now calculate just how deep the large - scale optical surveys are probing into the predicted large population of cvs with very low mass companions ( @xmath91 ) @xcite .",
    "a typical survey complete to @xmath92 would find all @xmath69 ( @xmath5 ) wds with @xmath93 k ( 7000 k ) that are within 200 pc @xcite , and thus all dn with @xmath94 yr@xmath38 , including most dn below the period gap that have not yet reached the period minimum .",
    "selection of the faint cvs is still a challenge ; color - selected surveys utilize their unusual combination of a hot wd plus a main sequence m star ( see @xcite for an earlier discussion and application to cvs in galactic globular clusters ) . the second round of discoveries of faint cv s from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , sensitive to @xmath9520th magnitude ,",
    "have just been announced @xcite .",
    "based on the initial set of 19 cv s and their orbital period distribution , @xcite claim that a large fraction of the 400 eventual cv discoveries will be of the low @xmath1 variety below the period gap .",
    "@xcite have also reported their discovery of three such systems in the 2df survey , sensitive to @xmath9521st magnitude , and expect to have about 20 low @xmath1 systems when the survey is complete .",
