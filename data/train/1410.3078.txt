    "to relate bare lattice results of hadron matrix elements and decay constants to phenomenological numbers , which are usually given in the @xmath3 scheme , the underlying operators need to be renormalized .",
    "this requires a nonperturbative method , because lattice perturbation theory is considered to be unreliable at present couplings .",
    "a general nonperturbative method is the ri@xmath4-mom subtraction scheme , which has been proposed in  @xcite , with some refinements being added in  @xcite . starting from the bare vertex function @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the quark green function with operator insertion @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the quark propagator , the renormalized vertex function is defined by @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the quark field renormalization constant , which is taken as @xmath11 } { 12\\sum_\\rho \\sin^2(p_\\rho ) } \\ , .",

    "\\label{eq : rimom1}\\ ] ] the lattice spacing @xmath16 is assumed to be one , if not stated otherwise .",
    "@xmath17 is the lattice volume .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath18 requires the calculation of three - point functions . in the case of flavor singlet matrix elements",
    "this entails the computation of quark - line disconnected diagrams , which requires inversions of the fermion matrix at every lattice point and still leads to a poor signal to noise ratio . in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative method , based on the feynman - hellmann ( fh ) relation , which eliminates the issue of computing disconnected contributions directly at the expense of requiring the generation of additional ensembles of gauge field configurations .",
    "this essentially involves computing two - point correlators only in the presence of generalized background fields , which we show arise from introducing the operator @xmath7 into the action , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the fermionic and gauge field actions .",
    "a further advantage of this method is that the signal to noise ratio will be directly proportional to the external parameter @xmath22 , and thus can be controlled from the outside , as opposed to the standard three - point function calculation .",
    "the quark propagators in ( [ gamma ] ) are calculated by inverting the fermion matrix , and so must be modified if we change the quark action .",
    "this change is straightforward to apply , only requiring a redefinition of the dirac operator .",
    "in addition , any modification we make to the action in ( [ action ] ) should be included during the generation of the background gauge fields . by choosing to neglect either one of these modifications , we are able to individually isolate connected and disconnected contributions to the vertex function .",
    "thus , modifications to the gauge configurations allow access to disconnected quantities , and modifications to the calculation of propagators allow access to connected quantities .",
    "this paper follows previous work on hyperon sigma terms  @xcite , the glue in the nucleon  @xcite , and the spin structure of hadrons  @xcite , already showing the potential of the feynman - hellmann approach to the calculation of hadron matrix elements .",
