    "yang - mills theory in two dimensions is at the intersection of many different fields of theoretical physics .",
    "it is one example of non trivial completely solvable gauge theory  @xcite , in which both perturbative and non perturbative effects can be studied .",
    "its large @xmath0 expansion has been proved to describe a two dimensional string theory  @xcite , namely a theory of branched coverings on a two dimensional riemann surface .",
    "non trivial topological sectors in the unitary gauge also seem to be related to matrix string states  @xcite .",
    "its partition function on a torus can be described in terms of a gas of free fermions  @xcite , and the kernel on a cylinder by the evolution of a system of @xmath0 free fermions on a circle , namely by the sutherland model .",
    "some new connections between two dimensional gauge theories and statistical mechanical systems were pointed out in @xcite where two dimensional gauge theories of the symmetric group @xmath6 in the large @xmath7 limit were investigated .",
    "gauge theories of @xmath6 also describe @xmath7-coverings of a riemann surface and hence they are closely related to two dimensional yang - mills theories ; the relation being essentially provided by frobenius formula that relates u(@xmath0 ) characters ( in a representation with @xmath7 boxes in the young diagram ) to the corresponding characters of the @xmath6 group .    it was shown in @xcite that the partition function of a gauge theory on a disc or a cylinder can be interpreted in terms of random walks on the gauge group , whose initial and final positions are the holonomies at the ends of the cylinder and the number of steps is the area of the surface .",
    "although the focus in @xcite was on the discrete group @xmath6 the argument can be trivially extended , as it is shown in the appendix of the present paper , to continous lie groups .",
    "similar results were independently obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is well known in random walks theory that after a certain number of steps the end point of the walk becomes independent of the starting point : the walker has lost any memory of the point he started from .",
    "the critical number of steps after which that happens can be exactly calculated in a number of situations , and the corresponding transition is known as cutoff transition .",
    "given the correspondence between random walks on the group and gauge theory on a cylinder , one expects to find the cutoff transition also in gauge theories .",
    "indeed it was found in @xcite that for an @xmath6 gauge theory where the holonomy on each elementary plaquette is given by a single transposition sheets of the world sheet . ] , a cutoff transition occurs in the large @xmath7 limit when the number of plaquettes ( and hence the area ) is @xmath8 , in agreement with previous results in random walks @xcite .",
    "models with more general boltzmann weight for the plaquettes have a richer structure of phase diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the stringy interpretation of the cutoff transition in the @xmath6 gauge theory is the following : beyond the transition the string world sheet is completely connected in the large @xmath7 limit , while before the transition the world sheet consists of a large connected part and of a small fraction ( in fact vanishing in the large @xmath7 limit ) of disconnected parts .",
    "another well known correspondence relates random walks with random graphs @xcite , that is graphs obtained by randomly connecting @xmath7 points with @xmath9 links .",
    "these can be put in correspondence with random walks on @xmath6 made of @xmath9 steps , each step consisting of a simple transposition .",
    "two types of transitions are known in the large @xmath7 large @xmath9 double scaling limit in random graphs : a percolation transition at a critical value @xmath10 when @xmath11 and the cutoff transition at @xmath12 when @xmath13 . beyond the transition , namely for @xmath14",
    "all the @xmath7 points are connected whereas before the transition a vanishing fraction of disconnected points survive .",
    "it is rather natural at this point to look for a similar transition in the large @xmath0 limit of u(@xmath0 ) gauge theories . a large @xmath0 phase transition on a sphere and on a cylinder in two dimensional yang - mills theories - the douglas - kazakov phase transition - has been known for quite some time .",
    "however this is not a cutoff transition . in a cutoff transition",
    "the partition function on a disc for instance becomes independent on the holonomy on the border of the disc , and this is not the case in the douglas - kazakov transition .",
    "besides the douglas - kazakov transition occurs at a finite value of the t hooft coupling whereas from the previous examples it appears that the cutoff transition occurs when the area scales as @xmath15 at large @xmath0 . from this point of view",
    "the douglas - kazakov transition appears more similar to the percolation transition in random graphs , although a precise correspondence is still to be found .",
    "the existence of the cutoff transition in the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath16d yang - mills on the sphere when the t hooft coupling scales as @xmath15 was proved by a simple argument in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to study such transition further on both the sphere and the cylinder , in order to characterize its phases and give some physical interpretation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we review the large @xmath0 douglas - kazakov transition and its physical interpretation . in section 2",
    "we introduce the cutoff transition on the sphere and study the phases above and below the transition .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the transition on the disc and on the cylinder and section 4 to the calculation of the expectation value of wilson loops .",
    "the partition function of a pure gauge theory on an arbitrary orientable two - dimensional manifold @xmath17 of genus @xmath18 , @xmath9 boundaries and area @xmath19 has been known for many years @xcite : z _ & = & e^-_d^2x ( f^f _ )   + & = & _ r_r(g_1)_r(g_p ) d^2 - 2g - p_re^-c_2(r ) .

    "@xmath25 is related to the actual area of @xmath17 through @xmath26 .",
    "we consider @xmath27 manifolds with at most 2 boundaries ; i.e. spheres , discs and cylinders .",
    "moreover , we will confine our analysis to the unitary groups @xmath28 and @xmath29 . a third order phase transition in the large @xmath0 limit",
    "was discovered in the case of a sphere by douglas and kazakov @xcite at a critical value @xmath30 of the rescaled area @xmath25 .",
    "this transition appears to separate a weak coupling ( @xmath31 ) from a strong coupling ( @xmath32 ) regime .",
    "these results were generalized to the case of a cylinder in @xcite where the phase transition was also interpreted as a result of instanton condensation .",

    "j(n_i -n_j)^2  e^-_i=1^n(n_i)^2 ,    the existence of a phase transition at the critical value @xmath30 can be easily derived from ( [ chp ] ) by noticing that the partition function ( [ chp ] ) is exactly the same as the one of a gaussian hermitian matrix model but with the integral over the eigenvalues replaced by the discrete sum over the integers @xmath35 .",
    "the solution of a gaussian hermitian matrix model in the large @xmath0 limit is given by wigner s semicircle distribution law for the eigenvalues : |()|=. [ wigner ] where the continuum variables @xmath36 and the corresponding density of eigenvalues ( ) = have been introduced . in ( [ chp ] )",
    "however the would - be eigenvalues @xmath35 are distinct integers and as a consequence the corresponding density @xmath37 in the large @xmath0 limit is constrained by : [ tr ] |()|1 .",
    "hence the wigner semicircle solution is acceptable only in the weak coupling phase , namely for @xmath38 where the condition ( [ tr ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "in fact the maximum of @xmath39 occurs at @xmath40 , it increases with the area @xmath25 and becomes equal to @xmath41 at @xmath30 , as easily seen from ( [ wigner ] ) .",
    "the solution in the strong coupling phase @xmath42 was found in @xcite and is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals . in this phase",
    "a finite fraction of the eigenvalues condenses , namely the distribution @xmath37 is flat and equal to one in a symmetric interval around @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "[ dopodk ] .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the partition function of two dimensional yang - mills theories with gauge group u(@xmath0 ) can be interpreted in terms of a gas of @xmath0 free fermions on a circle described by a sutherland - calogero model . in particular , if we denote by @xmath43 the kernel on a cylinder of scaled area @xmath25 and with the u(@xmath0 ) holonomies at the two ends given by the invariant angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 , it was shown that @xmath43 can be interpreted as the propagator in a time @xmath25 from an initial configuration where the positions of the @xmath0 fermions on the circle are given by @xmath44 and a final configuration with positions labeled by @xmath45 .",
    "the partition function on the sphere of area @xmath25 is a particular case where the initial and final configurations are just @xmath46 for all @xmath47 s , namely the amplitude for a process where all fermions start at the origin and come back to the origin after a time @xmath25 . by a modular transformation on the kernel of the cylinder",
    "one finds that the integers @xmath35 labeling the irreducible representations of u(@xmath0 ) are just the discrete momenta of the fermions on the circle . while in the momentum representation",
    "the douglas - kazakov phase transition can be interpreted as fermion condensation , in the configuration representation it can be seen in terms of instantons condensation @xcite . in fact , while going from the initial @xmath48 configuration to the final @xmath49 configuration , a fermion can in principle wind an arbitrary number of times around the circle .",
    "these winding ( instantons ) configurations do not contribute in the large @xmath0 limit to the weak coupling phase , as shown by the following simple argument .",
    "consider the wigner distribution ( [ wigner ] ) of momenta in the weak coupling phase .",
    "the maximum allowed momentum is @xmath50 , hence the maximum shift in position for a single fermion in the time @xmath25 is given by _",
    "max = a = 2 [ deltatheta ] the existence of winding trajectories requires this shift in position to be at least @xmath51 , namely @xmath25 to be greater of @xmath52 .",
    "hence the critical value of @xmath25 , where the douglas - kazakov phase transition occurs , marks the point where instantons condense , and contribute to the functional integral in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the douglas - kazakov phase transition can be achieved by introducing in the large @xmath0 limit the density @xmath53 of fermions in the position @xmath54 at a given time ( = area ) @xmath55 . due to the compact nature of the configuration space @xmath56",

    "matytsin proved @xcite that if the evolution equation of the fermions is given by the calogero - sutherland model then the density @xmath53 is governed by the das - jevicki equation @xcite which admits wigner semicircular distribution of radius @xmath59 as a solution : ( , t)= , || r(t ) [ kappa2 ] with @xmath59 satisfying the differential equation @xmath60 . on a sphere of area @xmath25",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath61 and the differential equation has the solution : r(t)= 2 [ radius ] the solution given by ( [ kappa2 ] ) and ( [ radius ] ) is valid provided the support of the density function @xmath62 is in the interval @xmath63 $ ] at all @xmath55 , namely provided @xmath64 .",
    "the maximum value for the radius @xmath59 occurs for @xmath65 and is @xmath66 .",
    "hence the condition for the validity of the wigner semicircular solution is @xmath67 . beyond the critical value @xmath30 the fermions",
    "`` realize '' that the space they live in is compact , instantons effects become important and ( [ kappa2 ] ) is not an acceptable solution any longer . on the cylinder",
    "a similar phase transition occurs in general , at a critical value of the area that depends on the holonomies at the boundaries .",
    "if the distribution of the invariant angles of the holonomies at the boundaries is the wigner semicircular distribution , then the critical area can be calculated exactly in the same way as for the sphere @xcite . for a more general discussion see @xcite .",
    "it is apparent from the discussion in the previous section and from the explicit form ( [ chp ] ) of the partition function that as the area of the sphere increases the distribution of the `` momenta '' @xmath35 ( i.e. of the integers that label the u(@xmath0 ) representations ) becomes more and more similar to a double step function , like the one drawn with dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ prima ] .",
    "in fact for very large areas the attractive quadratic potential tends to dominate over the repulsive force produced by the vandermonde determinant .",
    "the double step distribution corresponds to the trivial representation of u(@xmath0 ) in which all characters are identical irrespective of their argument .",
    "if this distribution dominates the functional integral then the kernel on a disc or on a cylinder becomes independent from the holonomies at the boundaries .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction and discussed in the appendix , the partition functions on the disc and on the cylinder may be interpreted in terms of random walks on the group manifold . from this point of view the very large area phase , where the sum over the irreducible representations is dominated by the trivial representation corresponds to a walk which is so long",
    "that the walker has lost any notion of the starting point .",
    "the transition where this situation sets in is known in random walk theory as `` cutoff transition '' , and the same term will be used here .",
    "the cutoff regime occurs for areas larger than a critical @xmath0 dependent value @xmath69 which was found in @xcite .",
    "the argument is very simple : consider the trivial double step representation @xmath70 that minimizes the casimir term @xmath71 r_0 :  \\{n_1,,n_n}= \\{,,- } .",
    "[ cutoff ] and compare its contribution to the partition function ( [ chp ] ) with the one coming from a representation @xmath72 in which @xmath73 has been increased by @xmath41 , namely in which @xmath74 . in other words we look for the value of @xmath25 at which @xmath70 ceases to be dominant .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the ratio between the two contributions is @xmath75 this ratio is larger than @xmath41 ( hence @xmath70 dominates and we are in the cutoff phase ) if @xmath76 .    in order to study this phase transition in more detail , it is convenient to parametrize the area @xmath25 by rescaling it with @xmath77 : a = n + [ param ] from the previous argument we expect the cutoff transition to occur at the critical value @xmath78 , separating two distinct phases .",
    "so yang mills theory on a sphere seems to have four phases altogether : the first two at @xmath79 separated by the douglas - kazakov phase transition at @xmath80 , the other two when the area is logarithmically rescaled with @xmath0 that are separated by the cutoff transition .",
    "the aim of this section is to find the saddle point configuration and the free energy in the two phases above and below the cutoff point @xmath78 : the cutoff phase @xmath81 has been discussed above and it is rather trivial , but the phase below @xmath82 appears as an interesting intermediate phase between the strong coupling phase in the douglas - kazakov transition and the cutoff phase . hence we shall concentrate on this in the rest of the section .",
    "let us consider again the partition function ( [ chp ] ) and the corresponding action    @xmath83    we want to find the extremum of this action in the large @xmath0 limit , when @xmath25 is parametrized as in eq .",

    "<S> inspired by the interpretation of two dimensional yang - mills theory on a cylinder as a random walk on the gauge group , we point out the existence of a large @xmath0 transition which is the gauge theory analogue of the cutoff transition in random walks . </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs in the strong coupling region , with the t hooft coupling scaling as @xmath1 , at a critical value of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 on the sphere ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two phases below and above the transition are studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the effective number of degrees of freedom and the free energy are found to be proportional to @xmath4 below the transition and to vanish altogether above it . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of a wilson loop is calculated to the leading order and found to coincide in both phases with the strong coupling value .    </S>",
