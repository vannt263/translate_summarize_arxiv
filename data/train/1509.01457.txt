    "mostly decide their optical and electronic behaviour .",
    "refractive index of a material usually decreases with an increase in energy gap fostering an underlying relationship between these two fundamental quantities .",
    "there have been many attempts to correlate these two quantities with a suitable empirical or semi - empirical relation [ 31 - 48 ] .",
    "recently , an empirical relation , based on some experimental refractive index data of some elemental and binary semiconductors has been proposed by tripathy , which can be equally applied to all regions of energy gap and can also be applied to ternary semiconductors @xcite . in the present work , we have used this recently proposed relation to investigate some of the optical and electronic properties of ii - vi and iii - v group semiconductors .",

    ", we have proposed an empirical relation for its calculation . at the end ,",
    "conclusions and summary of the work are presented in sect-4 .",
    "refractive index @xmath1 of a material is a measure of its transparency to the incident photons . for semiconductor materials ,",
    "it is considered as an important physical parameter . a proper design of optoelectronic device needs an accurate knowledge of refractive indices of materials .",
    "refractive index is closely related to the electronic properties and band structure of the material .",
    "theoretically , two different approaches are adopted to calculate the refractive index . in the first approach , it is calculated from the electronic behaviour concerning the local fields and the molar volume of the material . in the second approach , a more involved quantum mechanical calculation is performed to calculate the band structure which in turn is related to the refractive index of the material . since the band structure of a semiconductor",
    "is intimately related to its optical behaviour , there have been attempts to calculate refractive index from energy gaps . in this context , so many empirical relations between refractive index and energy gap @xmath2 have been proposed earlier@xcite .",
    "these relations have been widely used in literature to calculate different opto - electronic properties of different groups of semiconductors .",
    "recently , tripathy has proposed an empirical relation to calculate refractive index of semiconductors from their energy gaps@xcite . in that work",
    ", it has been shown that , the relation ( hereafter termed as tripathy relation ) can be successfully used for different group of semiconductors for a wide range of energy gaps . according to the tripathy relation , the refractive index of a semiconductor with energy gap @xmath2",
    "is given by    @xmath3,\\label{e1}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the constant parameters for a given temperature and pressure .",
    "the temperature and pressure dependence of these parameters is again a subject of intensive future investigations .",
    "even though the above relation can be applied to semiconductors with a wide range of energy gaps , the prominent region in which this relation works well is within the range @xmath7 . besides the tripathy relation , some other popular empirical relations available in literature are    moss relation @xcite : @xmath8",
    "ravindra relation@xcite : @xmath9    herve - vandamme ( hv ) relation@xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hydrogen ionization energy @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a constant assumed to be the difference between uv resonance energy and band gap energy . since ii - vi and iii - v groups of semiconductors have enough potential for optoelectronic device applications , we are interested in the present work to use the values of refractive indices calculated from these formulations to investigate some of their optical and electronic properties . for the purpose of calculation , we have considered those semiconductors belonging to these specific groups with energy gap lying in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the calculated values of refractive indices of these semiconductors can be obtained from ref.@xcite .",
    "the dielectric properties of a material is usually measured through a frequency dependent complex dielectric function having its real and imaginary parts , @xmath14 .",
    "the dielectric function describes the response of the semiconductor to the electromagnetic radiation mediated through the interaction of photons and the electrons .",
    "it depends upon the electronic band structure and explains the combined excitations of fermi sea .",
    "the real part of the dielectric constant determines the refractive index of a material and the imaginary part determines the absorption coefficient . the static limit dielectric constant @xmath15 is related to the refractive index @xmath1 through a simplified expression @xmath16 , where the magnetic permeability of the medium is close to 1 . in the present work ,",
    "we have used the tripathy relation in eq . to calculate the static limit of the dielectric constants of some ii - vi and iii - v semiconductors spanning over a wide range of energy gaps . in this context , we have considered semiconductors both from the narrow as well as wide band gaps . once the dielectric constant is calculated , the linear optical susceptibility can then be obtained in a straightforward manner using the relation @xmath17 . in the ii - vi group semiconductors ,",
    "the dielectric constants are calculated for cds , cdse , zns , znte , znse , zno , mgs , mgte , mgse , srs , srte , srse and are plotted as function of energy gaps in figure 1 .",
    "these semiconductors have energy gap lying in the range @xmath18 . in the figure ,",
    "the known values of dielectric constants have also been shown for comparison .",
    "our results are compared with the values calculated from the well known expressions of refractive index as proposed by moss in eq .",
    ", ravindra in eq . and",
    "herve and vandamme in eq .. it can be observed from the figure that , dielectric constant decreases with the increase in energy gap .",
    "the theoretical trends of the calculated dielectric constants fairly match with the experimental trend .",
    "however , in the lower energy gap region i.e. @xmath19 , the calculated values remain above the known ones and in the higher band gap region i.e @xmath20 , the predicted values remain below the known dielectric constants .",
    "it is interesting to note from the figure that , the theoretically calculated values from tripathy relation agree fairly well with the known values at more number of data points as compared to that of hv relation particularly for znte , znse , zno , zns , mgte and srs .",
    "for base and mgse the calculated dielectric constants from tripathy relation exactly match with the known values .",
    "tripathy relation and hv relation behave alike for higher energy gap region whereas in the lower energy gap region , tripathy relation predicts higher value of dielectric constant as compared to hv relation .",
    "the over prediction in the low energy gap region can be attributed to the exponential decay nature of the refractive index with energy gap in tripathy relation .",
    "however , refractive index from tripathy relation becomes softer in the wide band gap region and compares well with that of the hv relation .",
    "it is worth to mention here that , for the specific group of semiconductors considered here , hv relation predicts reasonably good values of refractive indices compared to those of moss and ravindra relation @xcite .",
    "calculations from ravindra relation do not have good agreement with the known values and therefore , for ii - vi group of semiconductors in the energy gap range @xmath21 one must be careful while using this relation .",
    "it can be emphasized that , moss relation and tripathy relation predict the dielectric constants reasonably well over the range of band gap considered in the present work and they can be used to a satisfactory extent for this group of semiconductors .        in figure 2 ,",
    "the dielectric constants of some iii - v group semiconductors such as nitrides , phosphides , antimonides and arsenides of ga , in and al are shown along with the known values .",
    "the theoretical values are calculated using some popular relations including the tripathy relation .",
    "the known values of dielectric constants are calculated using the known values of refractive indices from the relation @xmath22 . for this specific group of semiconductors , dielectric",
    "constant clearly shows a decreasing trend with energy gap .",
    "in fact , the decrement of the known values is linear with the energy gap .",
    "the theoretical calculations from tripathy relation and others follow the experimental trend . baring at few data points in the narrow band gap region i.e.",
    "@xmath23 , our calculations have an excellent agreement with the known values .",
    "but it is interesting to note that , the dielectric constants calculated from tripathy relation do not match with the known values for indium based semiconductors such as insb , inp and inas . our calculation over predicts the value of static dielectric constant for insb , inp and inas . for nitrides including that of inn , dielectric constants from tripathy relation are in close agreement with the known values and the agreement is much better than the calculations from other relations . also for gallium based semiconductors , the agreement with the known values are excellent . it is quite natural to expect that , in the low energy gap region , the calculated values from tripathy relation become more stiff compared to that of herve - vandamme .",
    "similar trend is also shown by moss relation at narrow gap region . however , at high energy gap region i.e. @xmath24 , the theoretical calculations from all empirical relations except the ravindra relation behave alike and also they agree with known values . in the high energy gap region ,",
    "dielectric constants from ravindra relation remain below the known values and those of other calculations .",
    "moreover , for the prediction of static dielectric constant for iii - v group semiconductors , moss relation is a poor fit and can be reliable only in the region @xmath25 , more specifically for nitrides of in , ga and al .",
    "since , the linear optical susceptibility is calculated from the relation @xmath17 , it shows a similar trend as that of the dielectric constant plotted in figures 1 and 2 and therefore we can draw similar conclusions on the behaviour of @xmath26 for these group of semiconductors . for ii - vi group semiconductors , in the low energy gap region",
    ", calculations from moss relation and hv relation are in closer agreement with that of the known ones and in the high energy gap region , tripathy relation and moss relation predict substantially accurate values of @xmath26 . except for the zinc based compounds such as znte , znse and zno , ravindra relation fails to predict the values of @xmath26 to satisfactory extent which may be due to the rapid linear decrement of refractive index with energy gap . for iii - v group semiconductures ,",
    "the predicted values of @xmath26 from tripathy relation for all other semiconductors in this group are in excellent agreement with the known values except for insb and inas .",
    "reflectivity @xmath27 , defined through the ratio of the reflected power to incident power describes the optical response of the surface of a material .",
    "the reflectivity or reflection coefficient is calculated from the refractive index @xmath1 of a material using the expression @xmath28 where , the extinction coefficient @xmath29 is frequency dependent .",
    "we may assume a very small @xmath30 for weakly absorbing media .",
    "also , @xmath29 vanishes at very high frequency i.e @xmath31 .",
    "in such a situation , the reflectivity of a material can be calculated from the high frequency refractive index using the relation @xmath32 .        in the figure 3 , we have plotted the theoretically calculated values of reflectivity of some ii - vi group binary semiconductors using the empirical relations for refractive index . in general , reflectivity of materials",
    "decrease with the energy gap and fairly follows a linear trend .",
    "however , for zno , the reflectivity lies much below the theoretical values as predicted by the empirical relations including the tripathy relation .",
    "it is interesting to note that , ravindra relation predicts somewhat a closer value for the reflectivity of zno . for the of calculation of reflectivity of ii - vi materials , ravindra relation can not be reliable except for the zno , znte and mgse .",
    "moss relation is more reliable compared to other cases for the calculation of reflectivity for ii - vi group materials .    in figure 4 ,",
    "the predicted reflectivity for some iii - v group semiconductors are shown . in the figure",
    ", we have also shown the reflectivity of these semiconductors as calculated from the known values of refractive index .",
    "for this group of semiconductor , the known reflectivity follows a linear relationship with the energy gap with a negative slope parameter .",
    "except in the low energy gap region in the range of @xmath33 , the theoretical calculations from tripathy relation have an excellent agreement with the known ones as compared to other calculations .",
    "the reason behind the non agreement with the known values in the low energy gap lies in the fact that , tripathy relation has an exponential decrement of refractive index with respect to band gap and at low band gap region , the refractive index shows a higher slope compared to others .",
    "however , a similar trend is also observed for moss relation at low energy gap region , where the refractive index behaves like @xmath34 .",
    "ravindra relation can be reliable in the range @xmath35 . in high energy gap region , calculations from herve - vandamme follow a similar trend with that of the tripathy relation .",
    "this similar behaviour can be observed for all other optical parameters considered in the text .",
    "this is because , the refractive index of tripathy relation behaves almost that of hv in the high gap region .",
    "the group of binary ii - vi and iii - v semiconductors are materials with total of eight valence electrons , tetrahedrally bonded compound semiconductors . the electronic structures , charge distributions and phase stability as determined by the competition between the covalent @xmath36 bonding and the electrostatic interaction play important roles in the observable properties of these compound semiconductors . in general , in ionic crystals , bonding between two atoms occur through the transfer of electron from one atom to the other resulting in two closed shell ions which interact through coulomb force and a short range repulsive force described by certain potential . for covalent crystals there is no such charge transfer rather a kind of charge sharing occurs between the atoms . in the later case , the interactions are described through different chemical or physical processes of hybridisation among the orbitals . in this context , the origin of bonding configuration is explained through a parameter @xmath37 called ionicity .",
    "the ionicity of a bond is defined as the fraction @xmath37 of ionic or heteropolar character compared to the covalent or homopolar fraction @xmath38 so that @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the range of this parameter is defined in the scale @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ionic extreme @xcite .",
    "after the thermochemical approach of pauling@xcite , there have been many attempts to understand and to calculate this parameter relevant for the studies of bond and structure calculations in solid state physics . from a molecular spectroscopic picture of bonding and antibonding states separated by an energy gap @xmath2 , phillips defined the ionicity scale @xmath37 for the tetrahedrally coordinated binary compounds @xmath42 in terms of the homopolar @xmath43 and the heteropolar @xmath44 components of the complex band gap @xmath45 as @xcite    @xmath46    the homopolar gap @xmath43 of the crystal is interpreted to be produced by the symmetric part of the total potential and the heteropolar gap @xmath44 results from the antisymmetric part of the potential .",
    "the homopolar gap can be calculated from a scaling of the optical gaps of group iv materials like diamond or silicon from the relation @xcite    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the lattice constant .",
    "phillips and pauling scales of ionicity are widely used for the study of band structure and bonding configuration of compound semiconductors .",
    "one of the interesting feature of the dielectric theory of phillips and vechten @xcite is that , it is possible to define a critical ionicity value , @xmath49 to each compound that separates four fold - coordinated crystal structures ( coordination number @xmath50 ) from sixfold - coordinated crystal structures ( coordination number @xmath51 ) . after the proposal of phillips and pauling ionicity scales ,",
    "there have been a lot of interest in the bond ionicity of compounds @xcite .",
    "assuming a nearly isotropic version of free electron model , penn proposed a wave number dependent model for the calculation of dielectric function for semiconductors @xcite which depends only on the average energy gap @xmath2 of the semiconductor . according to the penn model , the high frequency dielectric constant is given by    @xmath52,\\label{e8}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the valence electron plasmon energy and @xmath55 is the fermi energy . the valence electron plasmon energy can be calculated from the refractive index of the material using an empirical relationship @xmath56 , where the constants pair @xmath57 are @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively for ii - vi and iii - v group semiconductors @xcite .",
    "this relation has been successfully applied to a good number of binary semiconductors to predict their plasmon energies even though a direct method of calculation from the effective number of valence electrons taking part in plasma oscillations is available in literature @xcite .",

    "in fact , for some elemental semiconductors such as si and ge , @xmath68 .",
    "however , it has a significant contribution for many other compound semiconductors @xcite . since @xmath69 is a very small quantity , higher order in @xmath69",
    "can be neglected and the deviation factor @xmath61 can be taken as @xmath62 . in figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) , the deviation factor @xmath61 is shown as function of average energy gap for iii - v and ii - vi group of semiconductors .",
    "the deviation factor @xmath61 exponentially increases with energy gap for iii - v group materials and linearly increases for ii - vi group materials .",
    "higher the energy gap of the material , higher is the deviation for @xmath70 from unity .",
    "the solid dots in the figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) represent the values of @xmath69 . at low energy gap region",
    ", @xmath61 is very small and both the values , @xmath61 and @xmath69 , exactly match , but with the increase in the energy gap , there remains a little discrepancy , the values of @xmath69 remaining slightly above @xmath61 .",
    "practically , the difference will have a very little effect in the calculation of ionicity .",
    "it is now interesting to note that , if one gets the energy gap of a tetrahedrally coordinated binary semiconductor , one can get its bond ionicity through the calculation of refractive index . in the present work",
