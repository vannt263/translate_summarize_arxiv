    "strongly interacting quantum matter may undergo intriguing real - time evolution .",
    "prominent examples range from the expansion of an ultracold atomic gas released from a trap , or the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of a strongly correlated electron system , to an expanding quark - gluon plasma produced in a heavy - ion collision . due to the enormous dimension of the hilbert space , which increases exponentially with the system size ,",
    "understanding the dynamics of large strongly coupled quantum systems is a notoriously hard problem .",
    "even when considered in thermal equilibrium , euclidean time monte carlo simulations of such systems often suffer from sign problems .",
    "for example , the fermionic hubbard model away from half - filling or qcd at high quark density are currently inaccessible to first principles monte carlo simulations due to very severe fermion sign problems , thus preventing a better understanding of high - temperature superconductors or the dense cores of neutron stars .",
    "real - time simulations of strongly interacting systems are also currently beyond reach , due to very severe complex weight problems in the corresponding real - time path integrals . some sign problems even fall in the complexity class of np - complete problems @xcite , which can be solved in polynomial time on a hypothetical `` non - deterministic '' computer , but for which no polynomial - time algorithm is known on an ordinary classical computer modeled by a turing machine . since one expects that np @xmath0 p ( where p is the complexity class of problems that are solvable in polynomial time on a classical computer ) , a generic solution for general sign problems is unlikely to exist .",
    "this does not exclude that specific sign problems may indeed be solvable on classical computers .",
    "in fact , several severe sign or complex action problems have been solved with the meron - cluster algorithm @xcite or with the fermion bag approach @xcite .",
    "even the real - time evolution of a large strongly coupled quantum spin system , whose dynamics is entirely driven by measurements , has recently been simulated successfully with a cluster algorithm @xcite .    while it is not excluded that the doped hubbard model or qcd at high quark density can be simulated on classical computers , it is already clear that a universal quantum computer could indeed overcome several of the limitations of classical computers @xcite . in particular , since it operates with quantum hardware , a quantum computer can naturally manipulate complex amplitudes and thus does not suffer from sign or complex weight problems .",
    "although it is not known whether a quantum computer could solve np - hard problems , it would be extremely useful for deepening our understanding of the dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems . while theoretical constructions for quantum computers based on ultracold trapped ions exist already for some time @xcite , it is difficult to predict when powerful quantum computers may become available .",
    "the d - wave devices based on a network of superconducting flux qubits have been used to operate the quantum adiabatic algorithm @xcite on random instances of an ising spin glass @xcite .",
    "a comparison with simulated classical and quantum annealing algorithms led to the conclusion that the d - wave machines indeed perform quantum rather than classical annealing , but are not yet competitive with classical computers .",
    "as early as 1982 , feynman proposed to use specifically designed quantum devices to simulate other quantum systems @xcite . based on the experimental breakthrough of realizing ultracold bose - einstein condensates @xcite , feynman s vision of quantum simulators",
    "is becoming a reality . although they are not universal quantum computers , but special purpose devices that are designed to mimic a specific quantum system , quantum simulators have the potential to drastically improve our understanding of strongly coupled quantum systems @xcite .",
    "quantum simulators have been constructed using ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , photons @xcite , or superconducting circuits on a chip @xcite .",
    "one distinguishes digital @xcite and analog @xcite quantum simulators .",
    "a digital quantum simulator is a controllable many - body system , which encodes the state of the simulated system as quantum information , and executes a programmable sequence of quantum gate operations , following a stroboscopic trotter decomposition , in order to represent its dynamics .",
    "analog quantum simulators , on the other hand , realize continuous real - time evolution .",
    "they are limited to simpler interactions , but are more easily scalable to large system size .",
    "it was an experimental breakthrough when ultracold atoms in an optical lattice were used as an analog quantum simulator to address the quantum phase transition that separates a mott insulator state ( with localized particles ) from a superfluid in the bosonic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the optical lattice is realized with counter - propagating laser beams , whose intensity determines the amplitude for hopping between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the quantum simulation has been validated in comparison with accurate quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , which are possible because the bose - hubbard model does not suffer from a sign problem .",
    "the next challenge in this field is to quantum simulate the fermionic hubbard model , in order to decide whether it can describe high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "this requires reaching even lower temperatures in the quantum simulator than the ones achieved until now .",
    "when we use a quantum simulator to learn more about the dynamics of a strongly coupled system , we are actually doing an experiment . as usual in quantum physics , the device is first prepared in an initial state , it then evolves in time driven by its hamiltonian , and finally it is analyzed by measurements . by repeating the quantum simulation experiment many times , and by averaging over the measurement results ,",
    "one can compare it with the predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "successful quantum simulations benefit from close collaboration between theorists and experimentalists , from appropriately designing to accurately performing and theoretically validating the experiments .",
    "since quantum simulators are currently far from being standard devices , a theorist will want to know whether they are an appropriate tool for theoretical physics .",
    "ultimately , this will depend on their accuracy and reliability , which is currently limited but should improve significantly with time .",
    "certainly , classical computers have matured to the point where a theorist performing , for example , a monte carlo simulation does not necessarily think of herself as an experimentalist , despite the fact that she is operating a very sophisticated instrument .",
    "instead , she may think of a classical computer as a `` black box '' that perfectly realizes the computational model of a turing machine , which just extends our mathematical capabilities .",
    "it is currently unclear when ( or even whether ) quantum simulators or quantum computers will reach a similar status , but there is no reason to be overly pessimistic .",
    "even our brain , which is likely the most sophisticated piece of `` hardware '' in the universe , is not always completely reliable , but a theorist is not reluctant to use it as best as possible .",
    "quantum simulators and ultimately quantum computers promise to significantly extend our brain s capabilities in qualitatively new directions , and we should not be reluctant to push their development forward as much as possible .",
    "proposals for quantum simulator constructions already exist for some simple bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite field theories .",
    "hence it is natural to ask whether our understanding of strongly coupled systems in nuclear and particle physics may benefit from quantum simulation .",
    "this certainly is a long - term project , which can only be realized in small steps . before",
    "one addresses full qcd , one should gain experience with simpler toy - model gauge theories .",
    "such models may exist in a lower space - time dimension , they may have a simpler @xmath1 or @xmath2 gauge group , instead of qcd s @xmath3 gauge symmetry , or they may exist on a lattice away from the continuum limit .",
    "they may also have a reduced @xmath4 instead of nature s @xmath5 chiral symmetry , or they may have bosonic instead of fermionic baryons .",
    "all this implies that , for quite some time , we should not expect quantum simulations to yield quantitative results that are directly relevant to nuclear or particle physics .",
    "still , the toy - models mentioned above share different qualitative features with qcd , and will have similar dynamics , at least in some respects .",
    "in particular , like qcd , simple toy - model gauge theories may have a spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , which is restored at finite baryon density .",
    "they may also display color superconductivity at high baryon density , with or without color - flavor locking .",
    "one can also imagine that a gauge theory quantum simulator can mimic qualitative features of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "since we have no other way of reliably investigating qcd s real - time dynamics from first principles , the construction of quantum simulators for abelian and non - abelian gauge theories , with or without fermionic matter , is timely and most promising @xcite . once such systems are realized in the laboratory",
    ", they will also become interesting objects of study in their own right .    if quantum simulations were ultimately limited to toy - model gauge theories , they would be of limited interest for nuclear and particle physics . while the first steps towards gauge theory quantum simulations will be taken in simpler gauge theories ,",
    "quantum link models provide a long - term vision for how to eventually realize quantum simulations of qcd . the first @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge theories formulated with ( generalized ) quantum spins were constructed by horn @xcite , and further investigated by orland and rohrlich under the name of gauge magnets @xcite .",
    "quantum link models @xcite provide an alternative to wilson s lattice gauge theory @xcite for defining qcd beyond perturbation theory .",
    "both in the wilson formulation and in quantum link models , the basic gauge degrees of freedom are associated with the links connecting nearest - neighbor sites of a lattice that serves as a regulator of ultra - violet divergences . in wilson",
    "s lattice gauge theory , the link variables are parallel transporter matrices that take values in the gauge group . in particular , in lattice qcd they",
    "are @xmath3 matrices associated with each link . since the @xmath3 group space is a continuous manifold , in the wilson theory the local link hilbert space is infinite - dimensional .",
    "this poses a severe challenge for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms , because in practice only a small number of individual atomic states can be used to encode quantum information .",
    "in contrast to wilson s lattice gauge theory , quantum link models are ideally suited for quantum simulation because they have a finite - dimensional hilbert space per link . while @xmath6 quantum links are still @xmath7 matrices , unlike in the wilson theory , their matrix elements are non - commuting operators , which are generators of an @xmath8 embedding algebra . in the quantum link formulation of qcd ,",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom are described by a 20-dimensional representation of an @xmath9 embedding algebra . hence five qubits ( with a @xmath10-dimensional hilbert space )",
    "are more than one needs to represent the quantum information encoded in an @xmath3 quantum link , while a wilson - type link variable exists in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "thanks to universality , qcd can be regularized in several different ways , and it is useful to choose the most appropriate regularization , depending on the question one wants to address . certainly , when one wants to study qcd at very high energy , thanks to asymptotic freedom , one can use perturbation theory , which is best handled using dimensional regularization and renormalization applied to the standard qcd lagrangian .",
    "on the other hand , when one wants to address non - perturbative questions concerning , for example , static properties of hadrons , wilson s lattice qcd has proved to be the best suited theoretical framework . here",
    "we argue that the quantum link formulation of qcd is ideally suited for quantum simulations that address the real - time dynamics of quarks and gluons as well as qcd at high quark density .    in sections 2 and 3",
    ", we will discuss quantum simulators for abelian and non - abelian quantum link models , which share qualitative features with qcd .",
    "the concluding section 4 outlines what needs to be done in order to ultimately approach quantum simulations of qcd itself .",
    "quantum simulators encode the state of the simulated quantum system as quantum information in its discrete quantum states .",
    "ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices are used as quantum simulators for condensed matter systems including bosonic or fermionic hubbard models .",
    "the information about the corresponding quantum states is then encoded in the discrete positions of fermionic or bosonic atoms in the wells of the optical lattice as well as in the discrete internal states of the atoms .",
    "the gauge theories of particle physics , including qcd , are usually formulated with continuous gauge field degrees of freedom . even in wilson",
    "s lattice qcd , in which the gauge field resides on the links of a discrete lattice , the link variables themselves are continuous variables which give rise to an infinite - dimensional link hilbert space .",
    "it is not clear how wilson s continuously varying link variables , which take values in the gauge group ( @xmath3 for qcd ) , could be represented with a handful of discrete states , for example , of ultracold atoms .",
    "quantum link models provide an alternative lattice regularization of gauge field theories including qcd @xcite , in which the link hilbert space is finite - dimensional , and can thus be naturally represented , for example , with discrete states of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice .    in order to introduce quantum link models in a simple context ,",
    "we first consider a @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "quantum link models share most of the structure of wilson s lattice gauge theory in the hamiltonian formulation , in which space is replaced by a cubic lattice and time remains continuous . in this formulation , the gauge field",
    "is represented by classical parallel transporter link variables @xmath11 , which take values in the gauge group .",

    "the factor @xmath21 is associated with the sites and the factor @xmath22 is associated with the links @xmath23 connecting nearest - neighbor sites @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the @xmath26-dimensional spatial lattice .",
    "the links in the 1-direction have @xmath27 , the ones in the 2-direction have @xmath28 , and those in the @xmath29-direction have @xmath30 .",
    "the product @xmath31 around an elementary lattice plaquette @xmath32 represents the magnetic field energy .",

    "the gauge generators @xmath35 represent the difference of the local charge density @xmath36 and the lattice divergence of the electric field .",
    "physical states @xmath37 must obey the gauss law @xmath38 , i.e.  they must be gauge invariant . since @xmath39 is a continuously varying link variable , @xmath40 can take infinitely many values , and thus the hilbert space of wilson s lattice gauge theory is infinite - dimensional , already for a single link .",
    "quantum link models realize continuous gauge symmetries with discrete gauge variables and thus in a finite - dimensional link hilbert space . in an abelian @xmath1 quantum link model ,",
    "the link operator as well as the electric field operator are given by quantum spin operators @xmath41 associated with the link @xmath42 @xmath43 the quantum link operators @xmath39 and @xmath44 act as raising and lowering operators of electric flux .",
    "the eqs.([commuteeu ] ) , ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and ( [ gauss ] ) of the wilson theory still hold unchanged in quantum link models . the only difference , which allows the drastic simplification of a finite - dimensional hilbert space per link , is that now @xmath45 = 2 \\delta_{xx ' } \\delta_{yy ' } e_{xy } \\neq 0 $ ] .",
