    "much work has been done to enumerate the domino tilings of various regions , and related the number of perfect matchings of subgraphs of @xmath4 .",
    "when an exact enumeration has been elusive , or when considering more general types of regions , various aspects of the number of domino tilings have been studied . for example , in @xcite , pachter studied @xmath1-divisibility in tilings , and cohn examined the number of domino tilings of a square under the @xmath1-adic metric in @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown by this author in @xcite that the parity of the number of domino tilings of a region and of a subregion will be equal under certain conditions .",
    "this parity result leads to the question of whether there may be other moduli for which the number of domino tilings of a region and of a subregion will have the same residue .",
    "this article shows that for regions with reflective symmetry , there is such a result for the modulus @xmath0 .",
    "several of the proofs in this article are reminiscent of those in @xcite , but the fourfold nature of this topic requires additional sophistication and technical aspects .    in @xcite",
    ", propp suggested finding a combinatorial argument for the fact that the number of domino tilings of a @xmath2 rectangle is congruent to @xmath3 . there are analytic methods for enumerating the domino tilings of a rectangle , such as kasteleyn s formula ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are both even , this formula states that the number of domino tilings of an @xmath7 rectangle is    @xmath8    however , in general , the residue of this number , modulo @xmath0 , is not easy to compute analytically , and so a combinatorial method is desirable .",
    "this paper shows combinatorially that the residue , modulo @xmath0 , of the number of domino tilings of a region with reflective symmetry can be computed by looking at the analogous residue for certain subregions . this will , among other things , answer propp s question by showing inductively that the number of domino tilings of a @xmath2 rectangle is @xmath3 .",
    "this is not the first time that domino tilings for regions with reflective symmetry have been examined . in @xcite",
    ", ciucu studies the number of perfect matchings of a graph with reflective symmetry ( the dual of such an object is a domino tiling of a region with reflective symmetry ) , and derives a factorization theorem for this number in the case where the axis of symmetry separates the graph .",
    "however , this does not answer the question for the @xmath2 rectangle : one symmetry axis does not separate the graph , and the other will separate only if @xmath9 is odd , but the domino tilings of the subgraphs required in the factorization theorem would themselves have to be enumerated as a separate problem . in this paper , a region with a local property and a reflective axis of symmetry , whether or not it is separating , is shown to have the same number of domino tilings , modulo @xmath0 , as particular subregions .",
    "this is similar to ciucu s work , in that it considers symmetric regions , but it is applicable in different circumstances , and describes a different aspect of this enumeration .",

    "much of this terminology is also used in @xcite , although the class of regions considered there is broader , and hence the result is not as specialized .",
