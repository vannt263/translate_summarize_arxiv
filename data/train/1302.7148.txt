    "it is known that star formation activity in galaxies strongly depends on environment in the present universe .",
    "the high - density regions such as clusters of galaxies are dominated by passively evolving early - type galaxies , while there are many star - forming late - type galaxies in field ( low - density ) environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of star - forming galaxies systematically decreases with increasing local galaxy density ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . from these findings",
    ", it is considered that the star formation history of galaxies in general depends on environment .    in order to understand how the star formation history of galaxies depends on environment , it is important to investigate the star formation activity of galaxies as a function of environment in the early universe .",
    "several such environmental studies have been carried out at @xmath12 , when the cosmic star formation rate density reached its peak .",
    "@xcite studied the fraction of narrow - band selected [ o ii ]  emitters as a function of the local galaxy density around a cluster at @xmath13 , and found that the fraction of such star - forming galaxies is nearly independent of the local density , and does not decrease even in the core of the cluster . @xcite also found that the fraction of actively star - forming galaxies with bright ir luminosity slightly increases with the local galaxy density in a cluster at @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite similarly investigated the fraction of [ o ii ]  emitters in more general environments at @xmath7 , and found that the fraction is almost constant from low - density to medium - density environments .",
    "these results suggest that the relation between the star formation activity and the galaxy environment changed between @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "since the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) density decreases from @xmath16 to the present by about an order of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the change of the environmental dependence of the star formation activity might be directly related with the decrease of the global sfr density in the universe .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the star formation activity as a function of environment in detail at @xmath16 , when the cosmic sfr density started to decrease .    at @xmath16 , several studies in general environments claimed that the average star formation rate of galaxies increases with the local galaxy density ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , while some studies around clusters of galaxies reported that the fraction of star - forming galaxies decreases with the local density ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out a wide - field near - infrared narrow - band survey in the cosmos and ukidss uds fields .",
    "they found that the fraction of narrow - band selected h@xmath17 emitters is nearly constant or slightly increases with the local galaxy density from low - density to medium - density environments , and then the fraction decreases towards the highest - density regions such as rich clusters , which is consistent with previous studies both in general fields and clusters regions",
    ". such somewhat complicated environmental dependence of the star formation activity might be considered to be intermediate between those at @xmath12 and at the present .",
    "the next important step is to investigate the evolution of the star formation activity as a function of environment by directly comparing those in different epochs .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite made comparisons between @xmath16 and @xmath15 in general fields , while @xcite compared the results in groups and clusters at @xmath18 0.40.8 with those at @xmath15 . in this paper , we focus on the evolution between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , when the cosmic sfr density began to decrease . using the optical narrow - band imaging data in the cosmos survey @xcite obtained with suprime - cam on the subaru telescope",
    ", we investigated the fraction of narrow - band selected [ o ii ]  emitters in galaxies at @xmath0 as a function of the local galaxy density .",
    "the combination of the wide area of the cosmos survey and the [ o ii ]  emitter selection allows us to construct a large sample of star - forming galaxies with a secure redshift identification . by carefully choosing the selection criteria for our sample and adopting the same method for the estimate of the local galaxy density as our previous study at @xmath7 in the cosmos field @xcite",
    ", we directly compare the star formation activities as a function of environment between @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "section 2 describes the data and the methods for the sample selection and the environment estimate .",
    "in section 3 , we show the fraction of [ o ii ]  emitters in galaxies at @xmath0 as a function of the environment and compare it with that at @xmath7 , and then check the robustness of the results . in section 4 , we compare our results with previous studies , and then discuss the evolution of the fraction in the redshift interval and its relation to the decrease of the star formation activity in the universe .    throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a flat universe with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 .",
    "in this study , we use a sample of galaxies with photometric redshifts of @xmath2  0.920 from the cosmos photometric redshift catalog @xcite . we can select [ o ii ]",
    "emitters using the nb711 narrow - band data for the redshift interval . in order to directly compare with our previous results at @xmath7 ( @xcite , hereafter i09 ) , we need to match the magnitude limit of the sample to that at @xmath7 . in i09 , we used the sample of galaxies with @xmath23 at @xmath7 , which corresponds to the rest - frame 3500    absolute magnitude of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore we constructed a sample of galaxies with @xmath24 at @xmath2  0.920 ( hereafter sample a ) .",
    "the rest - frame 3500    absolute magnitude was calculated from the best - fit sed template derived in the photo-@xmath25 calculation @xcite for each galaxy .",
    "in addition to the sample a , we also construct another sample of galaxies at @xmath2  0.920 using the different magnitude limit , for which the luminosity evolution at the rest - frame 3500    between @xmath7 and @xmath0 is taken into account . in order to measure the strength of the luminosity evolution , we derived the rest - frame 3500    luminosity functions ( lfs ) for the @xmath0 and @xmath7 samples , and fitted these lfs with the schechter function .",
    "the estimated schechter parameters are @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the @xmath0 sample and @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the @xmath7 sample .",
    "the faint - end slope was fixed to @xmath30 in the fitting for the both redshifts .",
    "therefore we assumed that galaxies become fainter by 0.4 mag at the rest - frame 3500    from @xmath7 to @xmath0 , and used @xmath31 as another magnitude limit .",
    "the sample of galaxies with @xmath32 at @xmath2  0.920 is referred to as sample b.     vs. @xmath33 for galaxies at @xmath34 from the cosmos photometric redshift catalog .",
    "horizontal dashed line and vertical dotted line show @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . all galaxies with @xmath37",
    "satisfy @xmath38 .",
    ", width=302 ]    for the redshift range , we can almost completely sample galaxies even with @xmath32 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "all galaxies in the samples have @xmath23 , and the photometric redshift accuracy is the same as in our previous study at @xmath7 .",
    "the numbers of galaxies in the samples are 373 for the sample a and 733 for the sample b. the effective survey area is 5540 arcmin@xmath39 and the redshift interval of @xmath2  0.920 corresponds to the co - moving depth of 50 mpc",
    ". then our effective survey volume is @xmath40 mpc@xmath41 given the assumed cosmology .",
    "we select [ o ii ]  emitters from the samples mentioned above as star - forming galaxies using the narrow - band excess technique . in order to select the [ o ii ]  emitter",
    ", we use the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and nb711 bands photometry from the cosmos photometric catalog @xcite .",
    "nb711 is a narrow band with a central wavelength of 7119.6    and a full width at half maximum of 72.5  , which covers the redshifted [ o ii]@xmath443727 emission lines for galaxies at @xmath2  0.920 .",
    "we used the @xmath45 diameter aperture magnitudes in three bands .",
    "we adopted the correction for the photometric zero point presented by @xcite , which is calculated by comparing the observed multi broad - band photometry for galaxies with spectroscopic identification with the best - fit model templates .",
    "the zero - point corrections are 0.003 , 0.019 , and 0.014 mag for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and nb711 bands , respectively .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , for a @xmath51 detection on a @xmath52 diameter aperture .",
    "it is noted that we use the cfht @xmath53-band magnitude instead of the subaru / suprime - cam @xmath43-band one for galaxies brighter than @xmath43 = 21 because such bright galaxies appear to be affected by the saturation effect in the suprime - cam data .",
    "details of the imaging data and the photometry are given in @xcite and @xcite .    in order to select nb711-band excess objects , we calculated a continuum magnitude at the wavelength of nb711 from @xmath54 and @xmath55-bands magnitudes as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath46 and @xmath47 flux densities , respectively .",
    "its 3@xmath59 limiting magnitude is @xmath60 in a @xmath61 aperture . for the bright galaxies with @xmath62 ,",
    "the @xmath63 continuum is calculated as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the cfht @xmath53 flux density .",
    "vs. @xmath66 for galaxies with @xmath1 at @xmath34 .",
    "large open circles show objects classified as [ o ii ]  emitters .",
    "red symbols show galaxies with @xmath67 ( the sample a ) , while blue symbols represent those with @xmath68 ( i.e. , red @xmath69 blue @xmath70 the sample b ) .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the minimum excess of @xmath71 , and the solid curve shows the @xmath72 error of @xmath73 color .",
    "the dashed line represents the @xmath72 sensitivity limit for @xmath63 magnitude.,width=302 ]    then , we select nb711-band excess objects using the following criteria : @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 the former criterion corresponds to the rest - frame equivalent width @xmath77([o ii ] ) @xmath78  , which is the same as that in our previous study at @xmath7 ( i09 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : color ] shows the color - magnitude distribution for galaxies at @xmath2  0.920 .",
    "red symbols represent galaxies with @xmath79 ( sample a ) , and blue ones show galaxies with @xmath68 .",
    "the narrow and broad - bands data are deep enough to almost completely sample galaxies with @xmath77([o ii ] ) @xmath78  . here , we exclude x - ray sources as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) based on the x - ray information given in the cosmos photo-@xmath25 catalog @xcite . finally , we select 118 [ o ii ]  emitters out of 373 galaxies in the sample a and 233 [ o ii ]  emitters out of 733 galaxies in the sample b.       balogh , m. , eke , v. , miller , c. , et al .",
