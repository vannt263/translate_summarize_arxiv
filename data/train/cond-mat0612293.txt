    "more specifically , we have shown how single - spin flips may be achieved by combining the so coupling with fast gate - induced displacements of the electron(s ) , and how the so coupling together with the coulomb interaction gives rise to an effective spin - spin coupling , which is less sensitive to charge fluctuations compared to the exchange coupling @xcite .    here",
    ", we elaborate on a number of issues related to our proposal . first , we discuss a relevant experimental setup consisting of a gate - defined double - dot in an inas nanowire @xcite .",
    "this type of setup is of particular interest to us due to the strong so coupling measured in inas nanowires @xcite .",

    "@xcite a setup consisting of an inas nanowire placed above a number of gold electrodes was successfully fabricated .",
    "the gold electrodes were used to define electrostatically a double quantum dot within the inas nanowire , which was characterized using low - temperature transport measurements , and electrostatic control of the tunnel coupling between the two quantum dots was demonstrated .",

    "@xcite two additional gold electrodes were used as plunger gates ( not shown).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the choice of material is interesting due to the strong so coupling and the large @xmath4-factor in inas compared to gaas . in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements of a positive correction to the conductivity of inas nanowires were attributed to weak antilocalization arising from spin relaxation of electrons propagating through the nanowires .",
    "this interpretation was supported further by applying a magnetic field that was sufficiently strong to break time - reversal symmetry , thereby suppressing the weak antilocalization correction to the conductivity . a spin relaxation length on the order of 200",
    "nm was reported , but no definitive microscopic theory for the underlying spin - orbit coupling mechanism could be given .",
    "the exact nature of the so coupling in inas nanowires is still to be fully understood and deserves further experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "we expect , however , that the allowed type and strength of the so coupling in inas nanowires are highly dependent on various experimentally controllable parameters , _ e.g. _ , the growth direction of the nanowire .",
    "we now describe how the so coupling can be used to flip the spin of an electron in a controllable manner .",
    "motivated by the structure described above we consider a one - dimensional system consisting of a single electron trapped in a gate - defined quantum dot which we approximate with the harmonic potential @xmath5 along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "we assume that the minimum position of the harmonic potential , denoted @xmath7 , can be varied by changing the voltages on the gate electrodes .",
    "a static @xmath8-field perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis splits the spin states and determines the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the @xmath6- , @xmath10- , and @xmath9-axis define the lab frame in which the hamiltonian reads @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the strength of the so coupling . the particular form of the so coupling is assumed to arise from lack of inversion symmetry in the @xmath13-plane @xcite . in order to get a feeling for the so coupling it is useful to introduce the so length @xmath14 : without an applied @xmath8-field , a spin along the @xmath9-axis is flipped after having traveled the distance @xmath15 along the @xmath6-axis . another important length scale is the oscillator length defined as @xmath16 .",
    "it is convenient to work in a frame that follows the so induced rotation of the spin .",
    "we shall refer to this frame as the rest frame .",

    "below we describe a scheme for spin flips , which does not rely on any resonance conditions as in previous studies @xcite .",
    "instead , our scheme relies on fast ( on the time scale of the spin ) and large ( on the order of @xmath24 ) changes of @xmath7 obtained by controlling the potentials on the gate electrodes . considering a spin being in an eigenstate of the spin hamiltonian at @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath26 , the scheme reads :    1 .",
