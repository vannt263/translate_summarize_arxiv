    "in recent years , large progress has been made in the understanding and control of mesoscopic magnetic systems , which is driven by the interest in fundamental research as well as potential applications in molecular devices.@xcite dimensionality plays a key role here : magnetic confinement in one or more dimensions leads to strong changes in the density of states , i.e. , quantization effects occur,@xcite which become more pronounced with lower dimensionality .",
    "theoretical work on spin waves in low - dimensional antiferromagnetic ( afm ) systems reaches back to the early 1950s .",
    "while low - temperature thermodynamical properties in two and three dimensions are well described by a conventional spin - wave approach , the case of one dimension ( 1d ) is more difficult due to divergencies in the sublattice magnetization.@xcite these divergencies are deeply rooted in the fact that , by construction , spin - wave theory ( swt ) starts out from the assumption of a long - range ordered ground state , and their appearance provides a hint to the nature of the ground state , i.e. , whether it is disordered ( divergency ) or long - range ordered ( no divergency ) . however , despite these subtleties it has been found that also for disordered systems swts can produce results of high accuracy , e.g. , for the ground - state energy.@xcite furthermore , the divergencies could subsequently be removed by introducing constraints on the sublattice magnetization in the so - called modified swts @xcite and finite - size swts.@xcite this establishes a significant improvement , but nevertheless the applicability of swts to disordered systems remains a topic of current research .",
    "formerly , the main focus of the theoretical and experimental activities has been on systems of infinite extension,@xcite and it has only been in recent years that research on finite , or zero - dimensional ( 0d ) , systems has been intensified . in this context , the topic of quantized spin waves in mesoscopic spin clusters has been investigated.@xcite    a good physical realization of such mesoscopic spin clusters are molecular nanomagnets.@xcite they have been shown to be a vast experimental playground enabling the study of precisely defined clusters with chemically engineered exchange couplings and magnetic anisotropy , or topology .",
    "so far , a variety of mesoscopic and quantum phenomena such as tunneling of the magnetization and stepwise change in the magnetization have been demonstrated ( for reviews see refs . ) . a particularly intriguing type of spin clusters are afm heisenberg rings , in which a number of magnetic metal ions are arranged in the shape of a ring with nearest - neighbor afm heisenberg couplings .",
    "the hamiltonian describing their magnetism is given in its simplest form by @xmath3 with @xmath4 the magnetic coupling strength , @xmath5 the number of magnetic sites , and @xmath6 the spin operator of the @xmath7th ion with spin @xmath8 .",
    "their magnetism and spin dynamics have intensely been studied by a host of different experimental techniques;@xcite the recent experimental work on a cr@xmath0 spin-@xmath9 ring has probably most clearly demonstrated the nature of the elementary excitations.@xcite    on the theory side , the rotational - band model ( rbm ) has been established,@xcite and there has been striking experimental evidence that this picture is a good description for a variety of finite , bipartite afm spin clusters with varying topologies @xcite as well as some frustrated systems,@xcite but of course also exceptions exist .    the rbm classifies the lowest - lying magnetic excitations into two bands with a parabolic energy dependence on @xmath10 , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 band ( @xmath10 is the total spin quantum number ) .",
    "physically , the @xmath11 band can be interpreted as rotations of the two afm sublattices and is , so - to - say , a precursor of a long - range nel - ordered ground state in the infinite lattice ( it is also known as the tower of states or quasi - degenerate joint states @xcite ) . in contrast , the @xmath12-band states can be associated with quantized spin - wave excitations.@xcite for both bands , the energies are proportional to @xmath13 , but the @xmath12 band consists of several sub - bands which are shifted up in energy by constant offsets . for @xmath14 , this can be summarized as @xmath15 with @xmath16 or @xmath17 for the @xmath11 band , where @xmath18 may be regarded as the finite - size version of a spin - wave dispersion relation , and @xmath19 would become a wave - vector in an infinite system .",
    "there are several reasons for classifying the low - lying excitations into @xmath11 and @xmath12 band : the spectrum of a conventional swt exhibits zero - energy ( goldstone ) modes , with wave vector @xmath20 , reflecting the ( assumed or factual ) long - range order , which in the context of extended magnets are included in the notation of spin waves or magnons .",
    "however , in a finite system these @xmath20 modes exhibit a gap with respect to the ground - state energy , forming the @xmath11 band .",
    "these excitations are hence of different physical significance than the higher - lying magnon states ( @xmath12 band ) .",
    "the different nature of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 band is further manifested by the fact , that only the @xmath20 modes are responsible for the diverging sublattice magnetizations in the conventional swts , that the @xmath11- and @xmath12-band states have different sublattice lengths , and that the scaling with @xmath5 is generally different .",
    "in addition , this distinction is supported by a selection rule for the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) intensities , which at low temperatures allows only ins transitions between @xmath11 band states or from @xmath11 band to @xmath12 band states.@xcite this key characteristic has been experimentally demonstrated in great detail.@xcite owing to the obviously different physical properties in small systems , the @xmath11 band states should be distinguished from the spin waves or magnons .    in the above description ,",
    "the lowest excited state of an afm heisenberg ring is the @xmath21 state of the @xmath11 band , which to a good approximation has a gap of @xmath22 to the @xmath23 ground state .",
    "obviously , @xmath24 vanishes for @xmath25 ; it is thus a property of finite rings . in this context",
    ", haldane s conjecture @xcite should also be mentioned .",
    "it predicts that integer - spin 1d chains exhibit a gap in the energy spectrum while half - integer 1d spin chains do not .",
    "in small rings , however , there is numerical evidence that the gap is largely dominated by @xmath24 without discriminating integer or half - integer spin.@xcite this criterion , in fact , may be regarded as a definition of what we mean by  small \" or  0d \" .",
    "a further consequence of the small size is obviously that the spin waves become quantized , as there can be at most as many spin - wave modes as there are spin sites in the cluster ( the number of spin waves is slightly smaller than @xmath5 , for even afm rings it is @xmath26 ) .",

[ fig : mol ] ) . by a variety of experimental techniques , such as high - field torque magnetometry and ins ,",
    "the csfe@xmath0 molecule has been demonstrated to be a good model system for an afm heisenberg ring.@xcite it is characterized by eight fe(iii ) ions ( @xmath30 ) , which form an almost planar ring with a crystallographic @xmath31 symmetry axis ( @xmath32 axis ) perpendicular to the wheel plane . the csfe@xmath0 molecule was shown to be very well described by a generic spin hamiltonian with dominant nearest - neighbor afm heisenberg couplings plus an uniaxial single - ion anisotropy term , @xmath33 all the previous experimental data can consistently be described , with an accuracy margin of few percents , with the values @xmath34  mev and @xmath35  mev . however , all these experiments were only sensitive to the @xmath11 band states . here",
    "we extend the studies to higher energies , allowing for an investigation of the @xmath12-band states .",

    "the 3.8   spectrum , shown in the inset of fig .  1 , reveals two additional low - energy peaks at energy transfers of about 0.5  mev ( peak ia ) and 1.3  mev ( peak ib ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tdep ] shows ins spectra recorded on mari at temperatures of 5 - 58  k. the peaks ib , iii , and iv can again be observed , but thanks to the larger energy range and higher resolution , additional features become visible . in particular , a further peak at about 2.3  mev ( peak ii ) is resolved in the 15  mev data ( inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : tdep ] ) .",
    "an inspection of the temperature dependence of these four peaks suggests that they are cold transitions and of magnetic origin .",
    "additional features can be observed , such as the broad feature at about 2.5  mev ( feature marked by  ph \" ) in the high - temperature data and the many features at energy transfers above @xmath41  mev .",
    "their temperature dependence suggests a phononic origin .",
    "the observed low - energy peaks ia , ib , and ii are fully consistent with the previous investigations on this molecule , in particular , the ins experiments.@xcite peaks ia and ib correspond to the transitions from the @xmath23 ground state to the first - excited @xmath21 level , which is split by magnetic anisotropy into its components @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the magnetic quantum number of the total spin @xmath10 ) .",

    "first , we analyze the full @xmath36 dependence as presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : sqw ] for the temperatures 5 and 58  k and settings @xmath46 and @xmath47  mev .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence of the scattering intensity allows a clear differentiation : the magnetic scattering is determined by the magnetic form factors of the involved metal ions and interference factors reflecting their spatial arrangement,@xcite it is hence most significant at lower @xmath48 values .",
    "in contrast , the phonon scattering intensity increases with @xmath48 as @xmath49 . in the low - temperature data ,",
    "peaks iii and iv ( marked by black arrows ) are visible in the whole @xmath48 range , in particular , at small @xmath48 values , which strongly supports a magnetic origin of these peaks . in the high @xmath48 regime",

    "it reveals that the intensity of the peaks ib , ii , iii , and iv roughly stays constant with @xmath48 .",
    "it might be surprising that these peaks exhibit significant intensity even at @xmath48 values as large as approximately 4   , where the magnetic form factors have already dropped considerably ; we attribute this to a strong incoherent scattering in our non - deuterated sample smearing out the @xmath48 dependence .",

    "a comparison with the 5  k data nicely confirms the magnetic nature of peaks iii and iv , and also proves that the scattering at higher energies above 12  mev is purely phononic .",
