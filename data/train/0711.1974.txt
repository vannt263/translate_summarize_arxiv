    "the skyrme model @xcite is a non - linear theory of pions in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions with topological soliton solutions called skyrmions .",
    "the existence of stable solutions in this model is a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the mapping @xmath2 of the physical space into the field space at a given time , @xmath3 where the physical space @xmath4 is compactified to @xmath5 by requiring the spatial infinity to be equivalent in each direction .",
    "the topology which stems from this one - point compactification allows the classification of maps into equivalence classes , each of which has a unique conserved quantity called the topological charge .",
    "although skyrmions were originally introduced to describe baryons in three spatial dimensions @xcite , they have been shown to exist for a very wide class of geometries @xcite , and are now playing an increasing role in other areas of physics as well .",
    "apart from the original @xmath1 model which exhibits very structured solitonic solutions ( for a review see @xcite ) , other skyrme models are known to yield solutions with intricate structures .",
    "the baby skyrme model , first introduced by @xcite , is a two dimensional version of the original skyrme model , with @xmath6 as its domain . as its older brother ,",
    "it is known to give rise , under certain settings , to structured multi - skyrmion configurations @xcite .",
    "studies of other skyrme models defined on curved domains , such as two- and three - spheres can also be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "although most of these models are used as a simplification or as ` toy ' models of the full @xmath1 model , they also have physical significance on their own , having several potential applications in condensed - matter physics while often revealing useful mathematical features .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a baby skyrme model on the two - sphere .",
    "this type of model has been studied in @xcite , where only rotationally - symmetric configurations have been considered .",
    "we compute the full - field minimal energy solutions of the model up to charge @xmath7 and show that they exhibit complex multi - skyrmion solutions closely related to the skyrmion solutions of the @xmath1 model with the same topological charge . to obtain the minimum energy configurations , we apply two completely different methods .",
    "one is a full - field relaxation method , with which exact numerical solutions of the model are obtained .",
    "the other approach is a rational map approximation scheme , which as we show yields very good approximate solutions .",
    "we discuss these methods in detail in section [ sec : statsol ] .    in an exact analogy to the @xmath1 skyrme model ,",
    "our results show that the charge - one skyrmion has a spherical energy distribution , the charge - two skyrmion is toroidal , and skyrmions with higher charge all have point symmetries which are subgroups of o(3 ) .",
    "the symmetries of these solutions are the same as those of the @xmath1 skyrmions .",
    "as we shall see , this is not a coincidence .",
    "the model in question is a baby skyrme model in which both the domain and target are two - spheres .",
    "it consists of a triplet of real scalar fields @xmath8 subject to the constraint @xmath9 .",
    "the lagrangian density is simply [ o3lagrangian ] & = & 12 _ ^ + & + & , with metric @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the polar angle @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle @xmath14 .",
    "the lagrangian of this model is invariant under rotations in both domain and the target spaces , possessing an @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "the first term in the lagrangian is the kinetic term and the second term , of the fourth order in derivatives , is the @xmath16d analogue of the skyrme term @xcite . while in flat two dimensional space",
    "a third potential term is necessary to ensure the existence of stable solutions , in the present model it is not .",
    "furthermore , stable solutions exist even with the skyrme term missing .",
    "this is the well known @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) sigma model @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath19 in this model is an @xmath20 mapping .",
    "the relevant homotopy group of this model is @xmath21 , which implies that each field configuration is characterized by an integer topological charge @xmath22 , the topological degree of the map @xmath19 , which in spherical coordinates is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "static solutions within each topological sector are obtained by minimizing the energy functional [ eq : o3energy ] e&=&12 ( ( _ ) ^2 + ( _ ) ^2 ) + & + & ( ) . before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth noting here that setting @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o3energy ] ) yields the energy functional of the @xmath17 sigma model .",
    "the latter has analytic minimal energy solutions within every topological sector , given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 being some positive number @xcite .",
    "these solutions are not unique , as other solutions with the same energy may be obtained by rotating ( [ eq : rotsymform ] ) either in the target or in the domain spaces .",
    "the energy distributions of these solutions in each sector are rotationally symmetric , with total energy @xmath29 .",
    "we have found that analytic solutions also exist for the energy functional ( [ eq : o3energy ] ) with the skyrme term only .",
    "they too have the rotationally symmetric form ( [ eq : rotsymform ] ) with @xmath30 and total energy @xmath31 .",
    "they can be shown to be the global minima by the following cauchy - schwartz inequality : & & ( 14 ) ^2 + & & ( 14 ^2 ) ( 14 ( ) ^2 ) .",
    "the lhs is simply @xmath32 and the first term in parenthesis on the rhs integrates to 1 .",
    "noting that the second term in the rhs is the skyrme energy ( without the @xmath33 factor ) , the inequality reads @xmath34 , with equality for the rotationally - symmetric solutions .",
    "in general , if both the kinetic and skyrme terms are present , static solutions of the model can not be obtained analytically . the euler - lagrange equations derived from the energy functional ( [ eq : o3energy ] )",
    "are non - linear _ pde _ s , so the minimal energy configurations can only be obtained with the aid of numerical techniques .",
    "this is with the exception of the @xmath35 skyrmion which has an analytic `` hedgehog '' solution @xmath36}=(\\sin \\theta \\cos \\varphi , \\sin \\theta \\sin \\varphi , \\cos \\theta)\\,,\\ ] ] with total energy @xmath37 .    for skyrmions with higher charge ,",
    "we find the minimal energy configurations by utilizing a full - field relaxation method , described in more detail below . in parallel",
    ", we also apply the rational map approximation method , originally developed for the @xmath1 skyrme model and directly compare the results with the relaxation method .",
    "this method is also discussed below .      for the relaxation method ,",
    "the domain @xmath38 is discretized to a spherical grid  @xmath39 grid points for @xmath11 and @xmath39 points for @xmath13 .",
    "the relaxation process begins by initializing the field triplet @xmath19 to a rotationally - symmetric configuration @xmath40 where @xmath22 is the topological charge of the skyrmion in question .",
    "the energy of the baby skyrmion is then minimized by repeating the following steps : a point @xmath41 on the grid is chosen at random , along with one of the three components of the field @xmath42 .",
    "the chosen component is then shifted by a value @xmath43 chosen uniformly from the segment @xmath44 $ ] where @xmath45 initially .",
    "the field triplet is then normalized and the change in energy is calculated .",
    "if the energy decreases , the modification of the field is accepted and otherwise it is discarded .",
    "the procedure is repeated while the value of @xmath46 is gradually decreased throughout the procedure .",
    "this is done until no further decrease in energy is observed .",
    "one undesired feature of this minimization scheme is that it can get stuck at a local minimum .",
    "this problem can be resolved by using the `` simulated annealing '' algorithm @xcite , which in fact has been successfully implemented before , in obtaining the minimal energy configurations of static two and three dimensional skyrmions @xcite .",
    "the algorithm comprises of repeated applications of a metropolis algorithm with a gradually decreasing temperature , based on the fact that when a physical system is slowly cooled down , reaching thermal equilibrium at each temperature , it will end up in its ground state .",
    "this algorithm , however , is much more expensive in terms of computer time .",
    "we therefore employ it only in part , just as a check on our results , which correspond to a metropolis algorithm of zero temperature .    as a further verification",
    ", we set up the minimization scheme using different initial configurations and grids of different sizes ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) for several @xmath49 and @xmath22 values .",
    "this was done to make sure that the final configurations are independent of the discretization and cooling scheme .",
    "accuracy was also verified by checking conservation of the topological charge @xmath22 throughout the minimization process , yielding @xmath50 .",
    "computing the minimum energy configurations using the full non - linear energy functional is a procedure which is both time - consuming and resource - hungry . to circumvent these problems ,",
    "the rational map ansatz scheme has been devised .",
    "first introduced in @xcite , this scheme has been used in obtaining approximate solutions to the @xmath1 skyrme model using rational maps between riemann spheres .",
    "although this representation is not exact , it drastically reduces the number of degrees of freedom in the problem , allowing computations to take place in a relatively short amount of time .",
    "the results in the case of @xmath1 skyrme model are known to be quite accurate .",
    "application of the approximation , begins with expressing points on the base sphere by the riemann sphere coordinate @xmath51 .",
    "the complex - valued function @xmath52 is a rational map of degree @xmath22 between riemann spheres @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are polynomials in @xmath56 , such that @xmath57=b$ ] , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 have no common factors .",
    "given such a rational map , the ansatz for the field triplet is @xmath60 it can be shown that rational maps of degree @xmath22 correspond to field configurations with charge @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "substitution of the ansatz ( [ eq : rmap ] ) into the energy functional ( [ eq : o3energy ] ) results in the simple expression @xmath61 with @xmath62 minimizing the energy ( [ eq : ermap ] ) only requires finding the rational map which minimizes the functional @xmath63 . as we discuss in the next section , the expression for @xmath63 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iint ] ) is encountered in the application of the rational map in the context of @xmath1 skyrmions , where the procedure of minimizing @xmath63 over all rational maps of the various degrees has been used @xcite .",
    "here we redo the calculations , using a relaxation method . to obtain the rational map of degree @xmath22 that minimizes @xmath63 , we start off with a rational map of degree @xmath22 , with the real and imaginary parts of the coefficients of @xmath54 and @xmath55 assigned random values from the segment @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "as in the full - field relaxation method discussed above , solutions are obtained by relaxing the map until a minimum of @xmath63 is reached .",
    "in the @xmath1 skyrme model , the rational map ansatz can be thought of as taken in two steps .",
    "first , the radial coordinate is separated from the angular coordinates by taking the su(2 ) skyrme field @xmath65 to be of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 are pauli matrices , @xmath68 is the radial profile function subject to the boundary conditions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a normalized vector which carries the angular dependence of the field . in terms of the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , the energy of the skyrme field is    @xmath72    note that the energy functional ( [ eq : energy3 ] ) is actually the energy functional of our model ( [ eq : o3energy ] ) once the radial coordinate is integrated out .",
    "thus , our @xmath73 model can be thought of as a @xmath1 skyrme model with a ` frozen ' radial coordinate .",
    "the essence of the rational map approximation is the assumption that @xmath74 takes the rational map form ( [ eq : rmap ] ) , which in turn leads to a simple expression for the energy @xmath75 where @xmath63 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iint ] ) . as in our case , minimizing the energy functional requires ( as a first step , followed by finding the profile function @xmath68 ) minimizing @xmath63 over all maps of degree @xmath22 .",
    "since the symmetries of the @xmath1 skyrmions are determined solely by the angular dependence of the skyrme field , it should not be too surprising that the solutions of the model discussed here share the symmetries of the corresponding solutions of the @xmath1 skyrme model .",
    "the two approaches discussed in section [ sec : statsol ] have been applied separately to obtain the static solutions for charges @xmath76 ( the charge - one solution has an analytic representation , as discussed in section [ sec : statsol ] ) .",
    "this was done for several @xmath49 values within the range @xmath77 , although solutions with different @xmath49 s are qualitatively similar .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the configurations obtained from the full - field relaxation method were found to have the same symmetries as corresponding multi - skyrmions of the @xmath1 model with the same charge .",
    "the @xmath78 solution turned out to be axially symmetric , whereas higher - charge solutions were all found to have point symmetries which are subgroups of o(3 ) . for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,",
    "the skyrmions have a tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82 skyrmions have a cubic symmetry , and the @xmath83 is dodecahedral .",
    "the other skyrmion solutions have dihedral symmetries . for @xmath84 and @xmath85 a @xmath86 symmetry , for @xmath87 and @xmath88 a @xmath89 symmetry , for @xmath90 a @xmath91 symmetry and for @xmath92 a @xmath93 symmetry .",
    "the energy distributions of the obtained solutions for @xmath94 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "while for solutions with @xmath95 the energy density ( and also the charge density ) is distributed in distinct peaks , for solutions with higher charge it is spread in a much more complicated manner .",
    "the total energies of the solutions ( divided by @xmath96 ) are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , along with the symmetries of the solutions ( again with @xmath94 ) .",
    "application of the rational map ansatz yielded results with only slightly higher energies , only about @xmath97 to @xmath98 above the full - field results .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath63 were found to agree with those obtained in @xcite in the context of @xmath1 skyrmions . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the rational map approximation yielded slightly less symmetric solutions than the full - field ones . considering the relatively small number of degrees of freedom , this method all - in - all yields very good approximations .",
    "the total energies of the solutions obtained with the rational map approximation is also listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "we have studied the baby skyrme model on the two - sphere , obtaining the minimal energy configurations for all charges up to @xmath85 , using both the full - field relaxation method and the rational map approximation scheme . for each charge",
    "we have identified the symmetry and measured the energy of the minimal energy skyrmion .",
    "the solutions turned out to yield very structured configurations , exhibiting the same symmetries as the corresponding solutions of the @xmath1 skyrme model .",
    "we have explained the reason for these similarities between the symmetries of the two models and in the process we have exhibited a strong connection between them . the model discussed in this paper",

    "the energies of the solutions computed in the rational maps approximation are only slightly higher than the full - field solutions , and their symmetries , in most cases , are the same .",
