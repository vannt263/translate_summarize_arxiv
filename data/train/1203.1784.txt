    "in recent years , the discovery of accelerating expansion of the universe is an amazing development .",
    "it was firstly discovered by observing type ia supernova ( sne ia )  @xcite , which can be used as standard candles @xcite . the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "measurements from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and the large scale structure survey by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite confirm this accelerating expansion universe model .",
    "there are two kinds of ideas , i.e. the existence of the dark energy or modifications of the gravity theory , to explain this concept .",
    "the first scheme is most popularly discussed , and many models have been proposed , such as the holographic dark energy models @xcite and the chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "in addition there are also many modified gravity models , such as the brane world @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite and so on .",
    "the dark energy equation of state(eos ) which is the ratio of pressure to energy density , is a prefect quantity to study the behavior of dark energy .",
    "if eos is a constant @xmath10 , dark energy is the @xmath11 cold dark matter model(lcdm ) , and maybe dark energy is vacuum energy .",
    "otherwise the dark energy would be dynamical scalar field , such as the quintessence @xcite , the quintom@xcite .",
    "there are several way to explore the behavior of dark energy eos .",
    "the most popular way is to build a functional form for eos in terms of some free parameters .",
    "lots of eos parameterizations have already been discussed in the literature(such as @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "another way is picking a simple local basis representation for @xmath12 ( bins , wavelets ) , and estimate the associated coefficients  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are also some nonparametric way  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a new parameterization for the dark energy eos .",
    "in@xcite , the author developed a new dark energy eos parameterization : @xmath13 .",
    "it is obvious that when @xmath14 , @xmath12 has poor behavior and becomes infinite .",
    "this dark energy eos parameterization can only describe the behavior of dark energy when @xmath2 is not very large . to avoid this problem",
    ", we consider a new dark energy eos parameterization , which is the modification of efstathiou parameterization : @xmath15 .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is @xmath3 at present and @xmath12 becomes to ( @xmath16 ) when @xmath14 . in this model",
    "there are three parameters in all , which is @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath17 . as shown in@xcite",
    ", this eos will get to a nonphysical value in the far future time when redshift @xmath2 approaches @xmath10 , namely , @xmath18 will grow rapidly and diverge .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a global data fitting analysis on this new dark energy eos parametrizations , and present constraints on the model parameters from the current observational data , including the seven - year wmap data , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data , observational hubble data and sn union2 sample .",
    "since dark energy parameters are tightly correlated to some other cosmological parameters , such as the matter density parameter @xmath17 and the hubble constant @xmath19 , it is necessary to consider a global fit procedure in the investigation of the dynamical dark energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we review the new dark energy eos parameterization . in section iii , we describe current observational data we used . in section iv , we perform the cosmic observation constraint , the results are also presented .",
    "the last section is the conclusion .",
    "let us start by presenting some of the most investigated eos parameterizations(see also @xcite for other parameterizations ) : @xmath20 where @xmath3 is the current value of the eos , and @xmath4 indicate the revolution of the dark energy eos .",
    "the value of these parameter is determined by the observational data . when @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the dark energy model becomes to lcdm model .",
    "the first parameterization represents a good fit for low redshifts , but has serious problems to explain high-@xmath2 observations since it blows up as @xmath23 when @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for example",
    ", it can not explain the estimated ages of high-@xmath2 objects @xcite .",
    "the second one solves this problem , since @xmath0 is a well behaved function for @xmath1 and recovers the linear behavior in @xmath2 at low redshifts .",
    "the latter was introduced by efstathiou  @xcite .",
    "it was built empirically to adjust some quintessence models at @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath2 approachs infinity , @xmath12 has poor behavior and becomes infinite and this is unnatural .",
    "similar to the second model , let us consider the following eos parameterization [ eqn::eos2 ] w(z ) = w_0+w_a(1 + ) . where the value of @xmath12 is @xmath3 at present and @xmath27 when @xmath14 .",
    "if there is no interaction between dark energy and other component of the universe , one can show from the energy conservation law @xmath28 $ ] that the dark energy density evolves as @xmath29 \\frac{dz'}{1+z ' } \\right ) , \\label{eq : rho phi ( z)}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the critical density , it is defined by the following equation @xmath31 in this new parameterization , it is hard to write out the analysis formula of this quantity , it is calculated through numerical method .",
    ", @xmath32 ; green line : @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; black line : @xmath35 , @xmath36 . ]    in order to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations , we use the public parameterized post - friedmann ( ppf ) package developed by wayne hu(see e.g. @xcite for detailed discussions on ppf method ) to calculate the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "in figure [ fig : cls ] we plot the anisotropy spectrum for different choices of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we observe some obvious differences with respect to the lcdm case on larger scales ( multipole number @xmath37 ) . and for the model @xmath38 , there is a slit deviation on the peaks of anisotropy spectrum .",
    "in order to test this new model , we use the most recent observational data currently available . in this section , we describe how we use these data .",
    "we use the 557 sne ia union2 dataset @xcite .",

    "the datapoints we use are = 0.13900.0037 and = 1.7360.065 where the spherical average gives us the following effective distance measure @xcite , d_v(z)=^1/3    and @xmath47 is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch . also , @xmath48 can be obtained by using a fitting formula @xcite : @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 , \\\\ & & b_2=0.238(\\omega_mh^2)^{0.223}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "@xcite , the inverse covariance matrix is also given as follows @xmath76      the hubble parameter can be writen as the following form : @xmath77 so , through measuring @xmath78 , we can obtain @xmath79 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",

    "the data calculated by this way are less sensitive to systematic errors which is a great advantage@xcite .",
