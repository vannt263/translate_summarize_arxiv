    "as has been discussed in the course of this workshop , the classification of  stars is not as simple and straightforward as for other groups of chemically peculiar stars .",
    "when only low resolution classification spectra are used , it is likely that stars with different astrophysical properties but similar characteristics in the narrow spectral range are included .",
    "therefore a detailed spectroscopic investigation for a large number of confirmed  stars ( e.g. paunzen et al .",
    "1997 ) covering the whole range of atmospheric parameters is required to establish a common abundance pattern for these stars .",
    "up to now we have analyzed the chemical composition of six  stars where two of them turned out to be spectroscopic binaries ( paunzen et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in order to put our results on more solid",
    "ground we investigated the impact of using different programmes for the calculation of the model atmospheres on the abundances of three stars with different temperatures , gravities and metallicities ( heiter et al .",
    "the two issues we examined concerned the inclusion of individual line opacities and the calculation of the convective flux in the model atmospheres .",
    "high resolution spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios have been obtained at various sites as listed in table  [ obs_tab ] .",
    "they have been reduced with noao iraf ( willmarth & barnes 1994 ) , and atmospheric parameters and abundances have been derived as described by gelbmann et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the resulting atmospheric parameters are presented in table  [ par_tab ] .",
    "the abundances of each element for which at least one `` unblended '' line could be detected in the observed spectra of the programme stars are plotted in figs .",
    "[ abu_fig1 ] and [ abu_fig2 ] .",
    "`` unblended '' means that no other line with a depth greater than 30  % of that of the examined line is found within a wavelength window whose width depends mainly on the @xmath0 of the respective star .",
    ".observations used for this analysis . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the abundances of the three stars from fig .",
    "[ abu_fig1 ] were used to calculate individual opacity distribution functions ( odfs ) for these stars with a programme written by n.  piskunov ( piskunov & kupka 1998 ) .",
    "the subsequent inclusion of these odfs in the model atmosphere calculations instead of the tabulated opacities from kurucz ( 1993 ) showed that the @xmath1-relations and therefore the synthetic spectra of all three stars do not change significantly .    in the next step we compared the results of the original atlas9 programme ( kurucz 1993 , mlt ) with three versions where the treatment of convection ( or overshooting ) had been changed : 1 ) deletion of the part of the programme concerning the overshooting ( no ) , 2 ) implementation of the convection model by canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 , cm ) , 3 ) variation of the treatment of overshooting ( castelli 1996 , ovok ) .",
    "the differences can be summarized as follows : using the no version results in similar changes compared to mlt as for the cm model , whereas ovok yields practically the same @xmath1-relation as mlt . for hd84123",
    ", the largest differences occur in the visible spectral range ( see fig .",
    "[ con_fig1 ] ) , where the abundances of all elements would have to be decreased by 0.1  dex to match the mlt calculations . for hd192640 ,",
    "significant differences are only seen in the uv spectral range ( fig .",
    "[ con_fig2 ] ) .",
    "the cm flux seems to represent the observations better than that of mlt .",
    "note the absorption feature at 1600 , which can not be reproduced by either of the models .",
    "for the hottest of the stars , hd183324 , the differences are negligible .    this investigation was carried out within the working group _ asteroseismology  ams _ with funding from the fonds zur frderung der wissenschaft - lichen forschung ( project _ s7303-ast _ ) .",
