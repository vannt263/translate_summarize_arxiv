    "linear parameter - varying ( lpv ) systems @xcite are an important class of linear systems that can be used to model linear systems that intrinsically depend on parameters @xcite or to approximate nonlinear systems in the objective of designing gain - scheduled controllers @xcite ; see @xcite for a classification attempt .",
    "they have been , since then , successfully applied to a wide variety of real - world systems such as automotive suspensions systems @xcite , robotics @xcite , aperiodic sampled - data systems @xcite , aircrafts @xcite , etc .",
    "the field has also been enriched with very broad theoretical results and numerical tools @xcite .",
    "the objective of the paper is to extend the stability results in @xcite for lpv systems with piecewise constant parameters to the case of piecewise differentiable parameters .",
    "such parameter trajectories may arise whenever an ( impulsive ) lpv system is used to approximate a nonlinear impulsive system or in linear systems where parameters naturally have such a behavior .",
    "finally , they can also be used to approximate parameter trajectories that exhibit intermittent very fast , yet differentiable , variations . despite being similar to the case of piecewise constant parameters",
    ", the fact that the parameters are time - varying between discontinuities leads to additional difficulties which prevent from straightforwardly extending the approach developed in @xcite . to overcome this",
    ", we propose a different , more general , approach based on hybrid systems theory @xcite .",
    "firstly , we equivalently reformulate the considered lpv system into a hybrid system that captures in its formulation both the dynamics of the state of the system and the considered class of parameter trajectories .",
    "recent results from hybrid systems theory @xcite combined with the use of quadratic lyapunov functions are then applied in order to derive sufficient stability conditions for the considered hybrid systems and , hence , for the associated lpv system and class of parameter trajectories .",
    "we then prove that the obtained stability conditions generalize and unify the well - known quadratic stability and robust stability conditions , which can be recovered as extremal / particular cases .",
    "the obtained infinite - dimensional stability conditions are reminiscent of those obtained in @xcite , a fact that strongly confirms the connection between the approaches . to make these conditions computationally verifiable , we propose a relaxation approach based on sum of squares @xcite and semidefinite programming @xcite .",
    "the approach is finally validated through two examples",

    "are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "a function @xmath14 is positive definite if @xmath15 for all @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "given a vector @xmath18 and a closed set @xmath19 , the distance of @xmath20 to the set @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath22 and is defined by @xmath23 . for any differentiable function @xmath24 , the partial derivatives with respect to the first and second argument evaluated at @xmath25 are denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "lpv systems are dynamical systems that can be described as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the state of the system and the initial condition , respectively .",
    "the matrix - valued function @xmath30 is assumed to be bounded and continuous .",
    "the parameter vector trajectory @xmath31 , @xmath32 compact and connected , is assumed to be piecewise differentiable with derivative in @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is also compact and connected .",
    "when the parameters are independent of each other , then we can assume that @xmath32 is a box and that the following decompositions hold @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 .",
    "we also define the set of vertices of @xmath34 as @xmath41 ; i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "let us consider here the following hybrid system @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is open , @xmath46 is compact and @xmath47 .",
    "the flow map and the jump map are the set - valued maps @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "note that the trajectories of the above system are left - continuous and the right - handed limit is given denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "it is often convenient to define a solution ( or hybrid arc ) @xmath51 to the above system over a hybrid time domain @xmath52 where the first component denotes the usual continuous - time while the second one counts the number of jumps .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that the solutions are complete ( i.e. @xmath53 is unbounded ) .",
    "we then have the following stability result :    [ th : goebel ] let @xmath19 be closed .",
    "assume that there exist a function @xmath54 that is continuously differentiable on an open set containing @xmath55 ( i.e. the closure of @xmath56 ) , functions @xmath57 and a continuous positive definite function @xmath58 such that    a.   @xmath59 for all @xmath60 ; b.   @xmath61 for all @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; c.   @xmath64 for all @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "assume further that for each @xmath67 , there exists a @xmath68 and an @xmath69 such that for every solution @xmath51 to the system , we have that @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 , @xmath72 imply @xmath73 , then @xmath21 is uniformly globally asymptotically stable for the system .",
    "the above stability result only requires the flow part of the system to be stabilizing while the jump part is only required to be non - expansive .",
    "this result is fully adapted to the analysis of lpv systems with piecewise differentiable parameters since discontinuous changes in the values of the parameters can not have any stabilizing effect  quite the opposite . in this regard",
    ", the asymptotic stability of the system can only be ensured by the flow part of the system where parameters are smoothly varying .",
    "the objective of this section is to present the main results on the paper : the stability problem in the case of periodic parameter discontinuities is addressed in section [ sec : cstdt ] and extended to the aperiodic case in section [ sec : mindt ] .",
    "the results are connected to existing ones in section [ sec : qr ] .",
    "finally , some computational discussions are provided in section [ sec : computational ] .      in this section",
    ", we will consider the family of piecewise differentiable parameter trajectories given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 with @xmath78 in other words , the trajectories contained in this family can only exhibit jumps at the times @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( we assume that no discontinuity occurs at @xmath76 ) and hence the distance between two potential successive discontinuities  the so - called _ dwell - time _  is given by @xmath81 and is constant , whence the name _ constant dwell - time_. the associated hybrid system is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 the initial condition for this system is chosen such that @xmath84 .",
    "note , moreover , that @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "hence , starting from the above initial condition , the solution of the hybrid system is complete ( i.e. it is defined for all @xmath88 ) and it is confined in @xmath89 .",
    "the above hybrid system interestingly incorporates both the dynamics of the state of the system and the considered class of parameter trajectories .",
    "in addition to that , the state is also augmented to contain a clock that will measure the time elapsed since the last jump in the parameter trajectories .",
    "indeed , starting from the chosen initial condition , the system will smoothly flow until the clock @xmath90 reaches the value @xmath91 upon which the jump map is activated .",
    "the jump map changes the value of the parameter ( thereby introducing a discontinuity in the parameter trajectories ) and resets the clock , which places back the system in flow - mode . in this regard",
    ", we can easily observe that this formulation incorporates all the necessary information about the system and the parameter trajectories in order to provide accurate stability results .",
    "such a result based on the use of a quadratic lyapunov function is given below :    [ th : cstdt ] let @xmath92 be given and assume that there exist a bounded continuously differentiable matrix - valued function @xmath93\\times\\mathcal{p}\\to\\mathbb{s}^n_{\\succ0}$ ] and a scalar @xmath94 such that the conditions @xmath95+\\operatorname{\\varepsilon}i_n\\preceq0\\ ] ] and @xmath96 hold for all @xmath97 , all @xmath98 and all @xmath99 $ ] .",

    "we prove now that for the choice of the lyapunov function @xmath104 with @xmath105 for all @xmath106 $ ] and all @xmath107 , the feasibility of the conditions of theorem [ th : cstdt ] implies the feasibility of those in theorem [ th : goebel ] .    since @xmath105 for all",

    "therefore , we have that the feasibility of the condition implies that of statement ( b ) of theorem [ th : goebel ] with @xmath118 , which is positive definite .    finally , the condition of statement ( c ) reads @xmath119 and must hold for all @xmath120 .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition .",
    "finally , we need to check the time - domain condition .",

    "hence , @xmath126 and , as a result , the set @xmath21 is asymptotically stable for the system and the result follows .",
    "let us consider now the family of piecewise differentiable parameter trajectories given by @xmath127 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( we again assume that no discontinuity can occur at @xmath128 ) .",
    "the corresponding hybrid system is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 the initial condition for this system is chosen such that @xmath131 .",
    "this system contains an additional state compared to the system considered in section [ sec : cstdt ] in order to avoid the use of a time - dependent jump set ( a purely technical requirement that can be relaxed ) . using the current formulation , the current dwell - time",
    "is drawn each time the system jumps and the jumping condition is satisfied when @xmath132 .",
    "this leads to the following result :    [ th : mindt ] let @xmath92 be given and assume that there exist a bounded continuously differentiable matrix - valued function @xmath93\\times\\mathcal{p}\\to\\mathbb{s}^n_{\\succ0}$ ] and a scalar @xmath94 such that the conditions @xmath133+\\operatorname{\\varepsilon}i\\preceq0\\ ] ] @xmath134+\\operatorname{\\varepsilon}i\\preceq0\\ ] ] and @xmath135 hold for all @xmath97 , @xmath136 and all @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "then , the lpv system with parameter trajectories in @xmath137 is asymptotically stable .",
    "assume that the full trajectory of @xmath138 is known and such that @xmath139 for all @xmath88 .",
    "note that this is possible since @xmath138 is independent of the rest of the state of the hybrid system .",
    "then , there exists a @xmath140 such that @xmath141 for all @xmath88 and define the set",
    "@xmath142 ^ 2)$ ] .",
    "let us consider here the following lyapunov function @xmath143 the rest of the proof is analogous to that of theorem [ th : cstdt ] and it thus omitted .",
    "interestingly , it can be shown that the minimum dwell - time result stated in theorem [ th : mindt ] naturally generalizes and unifies the quadratic and robust stability conditions through the concept of minimum dwell - time .",
    "this is further explained in the results below :    when @xmath144 and @xmath145 as @xmath146 , then the conditions of theorem [ th : mindt ] are equivalent to saying that there exists a matrix @xmath147 such that @xmath148 for all @xmath149",
    ".    first note that since @xmath75 and @xmath145 as @xmath146 , then the solution of the hybrid system is complete .",
    "let @xmath150 , then we have that @xmath151 where it is assumed that @xmath152 and where @xmath153 is the little - o notation . from , we get that the first equation implies that @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , for the second expression to be negative semidefinite for any arbitrarily small @xmath155 , we need that @xmath156 be negative semidefinite .",
    "however , this contradicts the last one and hence we need that @xmath157 ; i.e. @xmath158 is independent of @xmath159 . finally ,",
    "since @xmath155 is arbitrarily small , then both - can be satisfied with a matrix - valued function @xmath158 that is independent of @xmath90 .",
    "hence , we need that @xmath160 and substituting it in - yield the quadratic stability condition .",
    "when @xmath161 , then the conditions of theorem [ th : mindt ] are equivalent to saying that there exists a differentiable matrix - valued function @xmath162 such that @xmath163 for all @xmath149 and all @xmath136 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath161 , then there are no jumps anymore and hence we can remove the condition as it never occurs .",
    "consequently , we can choose @xmath164 and the conditions - immediately reduce to .",
    "the conditions formulated in theorem [ th : cstdt ] and theorem [ th : mindt ] are infinite - dimensional semidefinite programs that are intractable per se . to make them tractable",
    ", we propose to consider an approach based on sum of squares programming @xcite that will result in a approximate finite - dimensional semidefinite program that can be solved using standard semidefinite programming solvers such as sedumi @xcite .",
    "the relaxation procedure can be performed with the help of the package sostools @xcite this conversion to an sos program is described below .    assuming that @xmath32 is a compact semialgebraic set ,",
    "then it can defined as @xmath165 where the functions @xmath166 , @xmath167 are polynomial .",
    "we further have that @xmath168=\\left\\{\\tau\\in\\mathbb{r}:\\ f(\\tau):=\\tau ( \\bar{t}-\\tau)\\ge0\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in what follows , we say that a symmetric matrix - valued function @xmath169 is a sum of squares matrix ( sos matrix ) if there exists a matrix @xmath170 such that @xmath171 .",
    "the following result provides the sum of squares formulation of theorem [ th : cstdt ] :    [ prog : periodic ] let @xmath172 be given and assume that the sum of squares program    is feasible .",
    "then , the conditions of theorem [ th : cstdt ] hold with the computed polynomial matrix @xmath173 and the system is asymptotically stable for all @xmath174 .",
    "the conditions of theorem [ th : mindt ] can be checked by simply adding to the sos program of proposition [ prog : periodic ] the constraints    * @xmath175 , @xmath176 , are sos matrices for all @xmath136 * @xmath177-\\sum_{i=1}^{m } \\upsilon_3^i(\\tau,\\theta,\\mu)g_i(\\theta)-\\operatorname{\\varepsilon}i_n$ ] is an sos matrix for all @xmath136    where @xmath178\\times\\mathcal{p}\\mapsto\\mathbb{s}^n$ ] , @xmath176 , are additional polynomial variables .",
    "when the parameter set @xmath32 is also defined by equality constraints @xmath179 , @xmath180 , these constraints can be simply added in the sum of squares programs in the same way as the inequality constraints , but with the particularity that the corresponding multiplier matrices be simply symmetric instead of being symmetric sos .",
    "we consider now two examples .",
    "the first one is a 2-dimensional toy example considered in @xcite whereas the second one is a 4-dimensional system considered in @xcite and inspired from an automatic flight control design problem .",
    "let us consider the system with the matrix @xcite @xmath181 where the time - varying parameter @xmath182 takes values in @xmath183 $ ] , @xmath184 .",
    "it is known @xcite that this system is quadratically stable if and only if @xmath185 but it is was later proven in the context of piecewise constant parameters @xcite that this bound can be improved provided that discontinuities do not occur too often .",
    "we now apply the conditions of theorem [ th : cstdt ] and theorem [ th : mindt ] in order to characterize the impact of parameter variations between discontinuities . to this aim",
    ", we consider that @xmath186 with @xmath187 and that @xmath188 .",
    "for each value for the upper - bound @xmath189 in that set , we solve for the conditions theorem [ th : cstdt ] and theorem [ th : mindt ] to get estimates ( i.e. upper - bounds ) for the minimum stability - preserving constant and minimum dwell - time .",
    "we use here @xmath190 and polynomials of degree 4 in the sum of squares programs .",
    "note that we have , in this case , @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the complexity of the approach can be evaluated here through the number of primal / dual variables of the semidefinite program which is 2209/273 in the constant dwell - time case and 2409/315 in the minimum dwell - time case .",
    "time - wise , the average preprocessing / solving time is given by 4.83/0.89 sec in the constant dwell - time case and 6.04/1.25 sec in the minimum dwell - time case .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] where we can see that the obtained minimum values for the dwell - times increase with the rate of variation @xmath194 of the parameter , which is an indicator of the fact that increasing the rate of variation of the parameter destabilizes the system and , consequently , the dwell - time needs to increase in order to preserve the overall stability of the system . for this example",
    ", it is interesting to note that the constant and minimum dwell - time curves seem to converge to each other when @xmath194 increases which could indicate that when the parameter is fast - varying between jumps then the aperiodicity of jumps do not affect much the stability of the system .     for the system - using an sos approach with polynomials of degree 4.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]     for the system - with @xmath195 using an sos approach with polynomials of degree 4.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "let us consider now the system with the matrix considered in @xcite : @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this system is not quadratically stable but was proven to be stable under minimum dwell - time equal to 1.7605 when the parameter trajectories are piecewise constant @xcite .",
    "we propose now to quantify the effects of smooth parameter variations between discontinuities .",
    "note , however , that the set @xmath32 is not a box as considered along the paper but the next calculations show that this is not a problem since a proper set for the values of the derivative of the parameters can be defined .",
    "to this aim , let us define the parametrization @xmath199 and @xmath200 where @xmath201 is piecewise differentiable .",
    "differentiating these equalities yields @xmath202 and @xmath203 where @xmath204 $ ] , @xmath187 , at all times where @xmath201 is differentiable . in this regard , we can consider @xmath205 as an additional parameter that enters linearly in the stability conditions and hence the conditions can be checked at the vertices of the interval , that is , for all @xmath206 .",
    "note that , in this case , we have @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now consider the conditions of theorem [ th : mindt ] and we get the results gathered in table [ tab ] where we can see that , as expected , when @xmath194 increases then the minimum dwell - time has to increase to preserve stability .",
    "using polynomials of higher degree allows to improve the numerical results at the expense of an increase of the computational complexity . as a final comment , it seems important to point out the failure of the semidefinite solver due to too important numerical errors when @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
