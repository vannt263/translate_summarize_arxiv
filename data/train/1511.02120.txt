    "[ intro ]    decoherence can be viewed either in its quantum picture , where it stands for the loss of phase coherence of a superposition state @xcite , or as its classical equivalent , where the phase of an oscillating signal is smeared due to frequency fluctuations @xcite . until recently , dissipation , which accounts for an energy loss over time @xcite ,",
    "was not distinguished from decoherence in nanomechanical resonators .",
    "the first reason for this oversight lies in the acquisition method : spectral acquisition , in which the driving frequency is swept through the mechanical resonance , does not separate the two processes , since both lead to broadened resonance lines .",
    "the response linewidth then leads to the definition of a decoherence time @xmath0 , in analogy with nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite or quantum information experiments @xcite .",
    "one way to unravel a dephasing mechanism is to perform a complementary time - domain ringdown measurement . here , the free decay of the response amplitude yields an energy relaxation time , since the decay rate only depends on dissipation , not frequency fluctuations .",
    "this procedure is analogous to a @xmath1 measurement for spins or qubits .",
    "having @xmath2 then leads to the definition of a pure dephasing rate @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "while the reported @xmath1 and @xmath0 for a particular qubit are often significantly different @xcite , such a difference in a nanomechanical resonator is still rare in the literature : usually mechanical systems seem to experience frequency fluctuations small compared to dissipation mechanisms , and do not exhibit visible spectral broadening due to dephasing @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , pure dephasing has been observed in refs .",
    "@xcite . but direct comparisons between time - domain ( @xmath1 ) and frequency - domain ( @xmath0 ) are still rare : thus , the second and main reason for the scarcity of experimental studies on mechanical decoherence is a lack of data _ combining _ these techniques . to our knowledge , only one recent work reports , for a suspended carbon nanotube , a signature of a pure ( yet nonlinear ) dephasing mechanism demonstrating @xmath2 @xcite",

    "indeed , the effects of frequency noise ( and its origin ) in nanomechanical devices is a subject intensely investigated today , both for its fundamental aspects and the technical limitations it poses to actual devices @xcite .",
    "besides , with the advances of quantum nanomechanics , the decoherence of quantum mechanical states also becomes a challenging issue @xcite .",

    "when driven with high input forces , our nems oscillation amplitude at resonance becomes high enough so its dynamics enters the so - called `` duffing '' regime , arising from a geometric non - linearity : the tensioning effect .",

    "this non - linearity is known to be important @xcite , which means that already modest drive excitations can bring the device into the duffing regime .",
    "this fact naturally brings in two questions : are there as well any nonlinear relaxation / decoherence processes to discover in sin structures , like for nanotubes",
    "@xcite ? and how do we perform @xmath1 and @xmath0 measurements within a highly nonlinear / bistable dynamic system ?    in the following we describe how to measure @xmath1 and @xmath0 response times that we defined in analogy with nmr over the whole dynamic range , in order to compare them as a function of motion amplitude .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath1 obtained from ringdown measurements is only sensitive to dissipation mechanisms , by analogy with longitudinal relaxation time in the bloch sphere for two - level systems .",
    "the ringdown is triggered by exciting the device at large motion amplitude at frequency @xmath49 close to @xmath50 , and suddenly detuning the driving force to a frequency @xmath51 where the device is off resonance .",

    "@xmath0 is affected both by dissipation and phase fluctuations , in a similar manner to the transverse relaxation time in nmr or qubit measurements .",
    "but one fundamental difference is that here we are dealing with an almost harmonic classical oscillator , not a quantum two - level system , so the analogy is restricted to the phenomenology of the decoherence phenomenon .",
    "moreover , while for qubits and spins the pure dephasing @xmath3 is defined through the comparison between @xmath0 and @xmath54 @xcite , in our system @xmath0 has to be compared to @xmath1 , similarly to the case of a classical spin @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fitnl ] shows both frequency and time - domain measurements in a highly nonlinear regime , with a peak - to - peak maximum amplitude of about @xmath55 , that is , more than three times the nems thickness . here",
    "the bistable resonance line can be fit according to the duffing model for nonlinear oscillators @xcite . in the linear regime ,",
    "the fwhm @xmath24 of the x quadrature directly yields the lorentzian parameter @xmath56 and is used to define @xmath57 . in the strongly nonlinear case , from the measured maximum amplitude @xmath26 one can calculate @xcite the intrinsic linewidth parameter @xmath58 used for the full nonlinear fit : @xmath59 .",

    "in other words , we do not identify any sources of nonlinear damping or dephasing in our sin system , as opposed to carbon - based devices @xcite .",
    "this result is achieved over an unprecendently broad dynamic range , with a measurement technique that can be adapted to other devices , in particular graphene or nanotube ones .",
    "as far as the present work is concerned , this establishes our device as an ideal nems resonator .",
    "in order to introduce a dephasing process , we deliver a gaussian noise with the awg connected to the gate electrode , instead of the dc voltage used previously for calibration purposes . our aim is to model `` slow '' fluctuations of the resonance frequency , that is with correlation times longer than the relaxation time @xmath1 @xcite . in the aforementioned work ,",
    "the interplay of the driving force with the frequency noise spectrum is characterized , in order to separate fast and slow noise contributions .",
    "complementarily , we focus here on how the driven response evolves with respect to the level of slow fluctuations . furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the frequency noise is experimentally taken to be gaussian ; we on the other hand extend the study to highly asymmetric statistics .",
    "the modelling is fairly generic ( see appendix [ appendixconvolutpic ] ) , and does apply as well to the case of slow telegraph frequency noise @xcite .        to keep only low - frequency fluctuations",
    "while avoiding spurious @xmath64 noise coming from the setup , the delivered voltage noise is thus filtered [ see fig . [",

    "this is the effective tunable parameter with which we characterize decoherence in our system .",
    "mathematically , we show that the averaging of fluctuations can be treated similarly to the case of `` inhomogeneous broadening '' in nmr @xcite , spatial - disorder being replaced , as for qubits , by time - dependent disorder ( see appendix [ appendixconvolutpic ] ) . in this context ,",
    "the @xmath0 time is re - named @xmath76 .",
    "however for simplicity we keep here the notation without the star , since our aim is to model the impact of _ any _ decoherence mechanism , especially intrinsic ones . even though our noise source is extrinsic . knowing the distribution @xmath77 , the altered susceptibility can thus be written as the convolution of the mechanical response @xmath78 in the high q lorentzian limit by the distribution @xmath77 : @xmath79 note that @xmath80 is also defined through @xmath81 , the spectrum of the frequency fluctuations , with @xmath82 .",
    "( [ chi_alt ] ) is valid only if the noise power is integrable ( which justifies mathematically the introduction of a higher cut - off frequency ) . in particular for @xmath64 noise , dephasing would depend on the measurement time since the lower bound of the spectrum would be fixed by the experiment duration itself ( which justifies our lower cut - off filtering choice ) .",
