    "recent experiments at rhic have revealed that the quark - gluon plasma in the vicinity of the qcd phase transition is strongly correlated ( sqgp ) with a low viscosity ( perfect liquid ) , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "it has been conjectured that this result of a flow data analysis might be due to the presence of hadronic bound states @xcite or resonances @xcite above the critical temperature @xmath2 for the phase transition .",
    "the persistence of hadronic correlations above @xmath2 has been obtained before in lattice qcd simulations . since the steep increase of the effective number of degrees of freedom which defines @xmath2 as seen in lattice data for the energy density @xmath3 could nicely be understood in terms of the hagedorn resonance gas @xcite , the question appeared whether the qcd thermodynamics even above @xmath2 could be interpreted in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom . assuming a spectral broadening of the hadrons due to a mott transition an alternative interpretation of the lattice data has been given @xcite .",
    "the key element of a microscopic formulation of such a mott - hagedorn resonance gas is the description of the mott transition for hadrons in hot and dense matter in terms of the hadronic spectral functions .",
    "first steps in this direction and possible consequences for the behavior of charmonium states in the sqgp at rhic will be discussed in this contribution .",
    "according to the above picture of the sqgp as being composed of strong hadronic correlations at a large phase space density , a huge number of energetically degenerate decompositions in terms of a hadronic basis emerges which are related to each other by flipping the string - type interaction links between quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the left two panels of fig .  1 give an example for such a string - flip process actually involving four pairs . at each time",
    "step the system has strong nearest neighbor correlations resulting in a liquid - like pair correlation function , see fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) .",
    "the string - flip processes may occur at a high rate leading to a sizeable spectral broadening of all hadronic basis states in accordance with the mott - hagedorn resonance gas picture which provides a physical understanding for phenomena like fast chemical equilibration and anomalous j/@xmath4 suppression .",
    "the suppression of the production of charmonia states at increasing the energy density in a heavy ion collision has been suggested as an indicator for qgp formation on the basis of a simple argument : the charmonia states obtained as solutions of the two - particle schrdinger equation for a temperature- dependent heavy - quark potential from lattice - qcd show a mott - transition of the j/@xmath4 bound state to the continuum of scattering states at @xmath5 , see @xcite and refs .  therein .",
    "this picture , however , is not appropriate for the situation of the sqgp where the medium consists of strongly correlated quarks in hadronic resonance states .",
    "the dominant process leading to j/@xmath4 suppression is then a quark rearrangement collision ( string - flip ) process @xcite corresponding to charmonium dissociation into open charm states , see fig .",
    "it has been shown that this process , which in the vacuum and at temperatures below @xmath2 is suppressed by a reaction threshold of @xmath6 mev , becomes critically enhanced at the chiral phase transition since the open charm mesons undergo a mott - like transition with a spectral broadening effectively lowering the charm dissociation threshold @xcite .",
    "the proper quantum kinetic formulation of the problem of heavy quarkonia states        in the sqgp can be given along the lines of the kadanoff - baym equation approach , where the propagators of the composite states in the quark rearrangement process are obtained from solutions of the bethe - salpeter equations for the corresponding t - matrices @xcite , see fig .",
    "the momentum - dependent lifetime @xmath7 of the charmonia states is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) stand for the effect of loss ( gain ) processes and depend on the hadronic green functions @xmath11 a_i(p)$ ] and @xmath12 defined by their spectral functions @xmath13 and phase space occupation functions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "within this approach the observed saturation of the anomalous j/@xmath4 suppression in recent rhic experiments is explained by the detailed balance between gain and loss processes when the charm meson phase space is sufficiently populated .",
    "a microscopic formulation of the qcd phase transition is suggested in terms of a hadronic basis with the hagedorn mass spectrum and a spectral broadening due to frequent quark rearrangement processes in a hot and dense medium ( mott dissociation ) .",
    "the approach provides a simultaneous understanding of lattice qcd thermodynamics , hadronic correlations above @xmath2 , anomalous j/@xmath4 suppression at cern - sps and its saturation at rhic experiments .",
