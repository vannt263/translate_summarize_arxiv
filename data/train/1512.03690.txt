    "flash memories are up to become a serious competitor of magnetic storage devices like hard disk drives ( hdds ) , at least for personal use .",
    "while flash drives have their upper hand in speed , hdds show benefits in reliability , capacity and costs . to be able to maintain this lead the areal storage density ( ad ) has to increase further , by decreasing the size of each storage bit .",
    "small magnetic grains must have high magnetic anisotropy to ensure high thermal stability of the stored binary information .",
    "the anisotropy is limited by the maximum available magnetic field of write heads .",
    "one strategy to overcome this so called magnetic recording trilemma is heat - assisted magnetic recording ( hamr ) @xcite .",
    "a laser spot locally heats recording bits near or above the curie temperature . due to the resulting reduction of the switching field even the magnetization of very hard magnetic materials",
    "can be reversed with available magnetic write fields .",
    "a high temperature gradient is usually believed to allow for narrow bits in hamr , due to a high effective head field gradient @xmath1 the effective head field gradient is believed to be a factor 3 - 20 larger than in conventional non - thermal recording @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , thermally written - in errors are a serious problem of hamr @xcite , and thus a detailed analysis of switching probabilities and bit error rates ( ber ) is desirable . in this paper we show how thermal fluctuations at high temperatures during writing , distributions of the curie temperature of the involved grains and different recording techniques influence the achievable ad and bit transitions .    a realistic model of the whole write process , including the accurate description of the grain s magnetization dynamics at elevated temperatures , is presented to gain insights into the basic mechanisms of hamr .",
    "the incorporation of temperature in the equation of motion of a magnetic system is computationally challenging , because one has to solve a stochastic partial differential equation with random fluctuations .",
    "this requires very short time steps during the integration , and thus even short trajectories are very time consuming .",
    "the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation @xcite allows a coarse spatial discretization of the magnetic grain model .",
    "the resulting speed up of the calculations makes it possible to investigate the switching behavior and ber of magnetic grains with realistic dimensions in detail and to estimate how far the areal storage density of bit - patterned media can be increased .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamr_techniques ] the examined hamr techniques are introduced . section  [ sec : models ] summarizes the implementation of the llb equation and explains the coarse grained llb approach we use in our simulations .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the resulting switching probability phase diagrams for different materials and hamr techniques . in this section also the ber for selected grain models calculated from the switching probabilities is shown .",
    "finally areal storage densities are estimated and transition jitters are computed .",
    "a conclusion of the results , including recommendations for the design of an optimal hamr device with high ad , can be found in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "currently two different strategies how a heat pulse can be applied to a recording medium during a write process are under discussion . in the first approach a pulsed laser spot",
    "is moved over the medium .",
    "the heat source is just switched on if the write head is located at the correct position to write a grain .",
    "the second technique uses a continuous laser spot",
    ". we will refer to the two different strategies as plsr ( pulsed laser spot recording ) and clsr ( continuous laser spot recording ) . in the following",
    "we illustrate how plsr and clsr are considered in our simulations .",
    "both have in common that the applied laser spot is assumed to have a gaussian spatial distribution with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 20 nm .",
    "the way how the time dependent temperature profile at the recording bits and the applied magnetic field are considered , differs for the methods .      during plsr the movement speed of the write head",
    "is assumed to be slow enough that the heat spot can be considered as frozen during the write process of a recording grain .",
    "this approximation holds as long as the application time of the heat pulse is short compared to the time the write head needs to cover the distance between two bits .",
    "hence , the heat pulse can be described per : @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the down - track and off - track distances between heat spot and bit , respectively .",
    "the duration , for which the heat spot is switched on , is denoted with @xmath6 , which is typically in the range of @xmath7ns . for a write temperature , at the center of the heat spot , of @xmath8 ,",
    "the pulse reaches the peak temperature @xmath9 at the recording grain , depending on the relative position to the spot per : @xmath10    a magnetic field is required to align the magnetization of the recording grains in order to store binary information . since the laser pulse is typically shorter than the magnetic field pulse the latter",
    "is assumed as constant during the whole write process in our simulations .      during clsr the movement of the heat spot",
    "can not be neglected any more , because the laser is continuously switched on .",
    "each bit along the same track is subject to the same heat pulse with the same peak temperature .",
    "@xmath9 merely decreases in off - track direction .",
    "the used temperature profile can be described with : @xmath11 being @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the speed of the write head with a down - track position of @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the down - track and off - track positions of the grains , respectively .",
    "in contrast to plsr , an applied magnetic field can not be assumed as constant in time during clsr any more . as a consequence",
    "the correct timing of the field pulse is important to correctly write information on the medium .",
    "we model the applied magnetic field with a simple trapezoidal pulse with a field rise and decay time of 0.1ns , respectively and a duration of 1.0ns .",
    "initially the field points in the @xmath17 direction , symmetric with respect to the half simulation time it switches to the @xmath18 direction and then back to the @xmath17 direction .",
    "more precisely , the field direction spans an angle of 0.1rad with the easy axis ( @xmath19 direction ) of the grains .",
    "the down - track position @xmath15 and the off - track distance @xmath5 , and thus @xmath9 , are important for a successful write process .",
    "all performed simulations ( plsr and clsr ) start with an initial temperature of @xmath20k .",
    "the external magnetic field is assumed to be homogeneous in space .      besides the above hamr techniques we distinguish in the following between two established write schemes , shingled and conventional recording . during conventional recording one track is recorded .",
    "must remain in their original state . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : writer_pattern]a illustrates the situation in which bit b is written . to prevent written - in errors the down - track bit d and",
    "all adjacent bits a@xmath21 must remain in their original state . as a requirement the adjacent tracks must retain their state for at least 1000 write processes of the center track .    in contrary , during shingled recording ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : writer_pattern]b ) a whole block of bits is written at once .",
    "hence , solely one adjacent track must be considered in the calculations .",
    "the bits a@xmath21 must remain unchanged for merely 1 write process .",
    "the magnetization of a magnetic recording grain undergoes a phase transition from a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state at the curie temperature @xmath0 . during hamr",
    "the temperature of the applied laser pulse can easily exceed @xmath0 .",
    "hence , an accurate simulation model must reproduce this phase transition in each computational cell .",
    "the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation can fulfill this requirement , as has been confirmed in various publications  @xcite .",
    "our model is based on the following formulation  @xcite : @xmath22 \\right \\}\\nonumber \\\\    & + & \\frac{\\alpha_\\parallel   \\mu_0{\\gamma'}}{m^2}\\boldsymbol{m}\\left ( \\boldsymbol{m}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{h}_{\\mathrm{eff } }   \\right ) + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\parallel}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 is the reduced electron gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath24 with @xmath25(ts)@xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the vacuum permeability and @xmath28 is the reduced magnetization @xmath29 , with the saturation magnetization at zero temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : llb ] describe precession and damping of the system ( perpendicular relaxation ) and the last two terms denote the length change of the magnetization ( longitudinal relaxation ) during the time evolution . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are dimensionless temperature dependent longitudinal and transverse damping parameters @xmath33 which are connected to the atomistic coupling of the spins to a heat bath with the parameter @xmath34 . to account for thermal fluctuations longitudinal and perpendicular thermal fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 , consisting of white noise random numbers , are used .",
    "the main contributions of the effective magnetic field @xmath37 are the external magnetic field @xmath38 , the anisotropy field @xmath39 which is assumed to point along the @xmath19-direction , and the internal exchange field @xmath40 three temperature dependent material functions appear in @xmath41 and @xmath42 , namely the zero field equilibrium magnetization @xmath43 , the longitudinal and the perpendicular susceptibility @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it has to be mentioned that magnetostatic interactions are not included in the model . to be able to integrate the llb equation ( eq .  [ eq : llb ] ) at arbitrary temperatures these functions",
    "must be determined for each material which is involved in the particles .",
    "we obtain the material functions from simulations with the atomistic code vampire  @xcite , which solves the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation for the considered magnetic grains having an atomistic spatial discretization .",
    "in contrast to an atomistic model , in which the time integration of all magnetic moments in a recording grain , with realistic lateral dimensions of several nanometers , is computationally very expensive , the coarse grained llb model describes each material with just one vector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : layer_model ] ) . in multilayer structures an intergrain exchange field couples neighboring layers .",

    "coupled to a sm layer with high @xmath0 . each material layer",
    "is represented by a single magnetization vector @xmath28 . ]    hence , realistic recording grains can be efficiently simulated with low computational effort . nevertheless , the resulting dynamic trajectories of the atomistic and coarse - grained model are in good agreement  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate two different grains for bit - patterned recording . both have a cylindrical basal plane with a diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm",
    "we compare a single hard magnetic ( hm1 ) grain and a bilayer structure with graded curie temperature , consisting of a hm2 material layer coupled to a soft magnetic ( sm ) one in a ratio of 50:50 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : layer_model ] ) .",
    "both hm layers have large uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "they differ in their curie temperature .",
    "the sm material is a perfect soft magnet with a large saturation magnetization comparable to that of pure fe .",

    "[ tab : clsr_transition_jitters ] transition jitters in both directions and for both considered grains ( hm1 and hm2/sm ) are illustrated for various distributions of the curie temperature and various head field velocities . if magnetostatic interactions are considered only transition jitters for parameters leading to maximum ad are evaluated .    as expected",
    "the transition jitters are larger for lower write temperatures .",
    "this holds for both grains and independent from the head velocity and @xmath0 distribution . without any distribution of the curie temperature ( @xmath48% ) the jitters in down - track and off - track direction",
    "are very similar . for larger @xmath0 distribution",
    "the jitter in down - track direction does not increase very much , in contrast to @xmath49 .",
    "this is not surprising , because the curie temperature distribution directly affects only the switching probabilities along the peak temperature axis .",
    "the broadening in down - track direction is an indirect effect . if one compares tabs .",
    "[ tab : plsr_transition_jitters ] and [ tab : clsr_transition_jitters ] one notices that the transition jitters in off - track direction for clsr and those for plsr in case of the hm2/sm grain are almost identical .",
    "the values are throughout a bit better for a head velocity of 7.5 m/s and a bit worse for 10ms .",
    "the lower optimal down - track spacings , and thus higher ad , for shingled clsr can be explained with the lower down - track transition jitter if @xmath0 distributions are considered .    in case of the pure hm1 grain",
    "the transition jitters are significantly lower in both directions .",
    "if magnetostatic interactions are considered the jitter is still smaller than for the hm2/sm grain without any @xmath0 distributions .",
    "additionally the strayfield does not shift the phase transition much , resulting in a low @xmath50 , and thus a small jitter .",
    "these are clearly the reasons for the high ad found in @xcite .",
    "compared to magnetic recording of exchange spring - media without heat - assist @xcite one has to mention that in case of hamr the transition jitters for the hm2/sm grain with magnetostatic interactions are larger in off - track direction and comparable in down - track direction .",
    "the hm1 grain shows a significant lowering of the transition jitter in both directions .",
    "to conclude , with a coarse grained llb model for exchange coupled curie temperature modulated grains , postulated in a previous work @xcite , we extensively examined the switching behavior of small cylindrical recording grains ( @xmath51 nm , @xmath52 nm ) during hamr of bit - patterned media . in detail",
    "we considered two different recording techniques , one where the heat spot is pulsed ( plsr ) and one where a continuous spot moves over the medium ( clsr ) .",
    "in addition shingled and conventional recording were discussed . with the computed switching phase diagrams bit error rates ( ber ) for various heat spot positions , grain spacings and write temperatures could be determined . to picture the whole write process",
    "as realistic as possible we assumed a distribution of the grain s curie temperatures , a displacement jitter of the head and the bit positions and a size distribution of the bits according to the astc guidelines .",
    "we investigated two grain types , a pure hard magnetic one , which has similar properties as fept and a bilayer structure with graded curie temperature comparable to fe / fept , where fe is for example doped with tb to achieve high damping .    in case of plsr",
    "the maximum achieved areal densities ( ad ) were slightly below 5tb",
    "/ in@xmath53 for the bilayer structure .",
    "the main problem is that due to the short heat pulse the switching of the grains is not sufficiently reliable with 0.8 t external field , even if grains with graded curie temperature are used to further assist the write process .",
    "hence , the transition jitter of the switching probability is too large to reach higher ad .",
    "for clsr of the same bilayer structure the maximum ad is a bit higher than for plsr .",
    "although , the transition jitter in off - track direction is similar to the calculated plsr value , the according jitter in down - track direction is clearly smaller , yielding smaller down - track spacing , and thus a higher ad with 5.61tb / in@xmath53 . because of the high saturation magnetizations of fe and fept the performance of the graded structure suffers from large magnetostatic interactions involving increased transition jitters .",
    "the pure hard magnetic grain displays very narrow transitions .",
    "the obtained jitters are significantly lower than for magnetic recording of exchange coupled media without heat - assist .",
    "hence , clsr with an ad beyond 10tb / in@xmath53 was reported in @xcite .",
    "for the given magnetic write fields plsr of the single phase grain does not reach a 100% switching probability at elevated temperatures .",
    "the reason are again the short heat pulses yielding a lack of reversal time for the magnetic moments , and thus short effective recording time windows .",
    "note , the presented promising ad are based on bit - pattered media with very narrow size distributions .",
    "manufacturing such patterns is not yet feasible , but is expected to be in the future .",
    "additionally successfully written patterns have to be read with a low signal to noise ratio .",
    "although a reader design for bit - pattered media with a density of 10tb / in@xmath53 was proposed in @xcite a lot of work on the reader side has to be done until a working prototype with a user density of 10tb / in@xmath53 can be realized .    altogether",
    ", our simulations suggest that shingled clsr is the most promising hamr technique for future high density bit - patterned media .",
    "multilayer structures with graded curie temperatures and optimized saturation magnetizations @xcite could improve the switching performance of these grains to possibly outreach the obtained ad for hard magnetic single phase grains . to further decrease the thermal jitter",
    "multilayer structures like fe / ferh / fept with an interlayer showing a first order phase transition , to switch the interactions between the soft and hard magnetic parts of the grain on and off , are also thinkable .",
