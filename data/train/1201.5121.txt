    "the lyman @xmath0 forest corresponds to the large number of absorption features located blueward of the lyman @xmath0 emission line in the spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) . in the last decade , thanks to the power of 10-m class telescopes equipped with high - resolution spectrographs , considerable progress has been made toward understanding the nature of these absorption features .",
    "this population of discrete lines is due to hi absorption arising from the filamentary structure of the cosmic - web , and in the approximation of a gaussian velocity dispersion can be well described by a series of voigt profiles ( rauch 1998 ) . a variable amount of absorption in the lyman @xmath0  forest is also due to ultraviolet ( uv ) transitions from heavy element ions which are usually associated with strong lyman @xmath0 lines .",
    "quantities often studied in analyses of qso spectra include the power spectrum of the flux distribution , which is used to constrain cosmological parameters and probe the dark matter power spectrum on scales of order of 50 @xmath14 mpc ( e.g. croft et al .",

    "another quantity thoroughly studied in the last few years is the flux probability distribution function ( pdf ) , which is sensitive not only to the spatial distribution of dark matter , but also to the thermal state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",

    "agreement between the data and simulations was obtained by adopting a power - law temperature - density relation , @xmath15 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) , where the low density igm ( @xmath16 ) was close to isothermal ( i.e. with @xmath17 ) or inverted ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this result implied that the low - density regions of the igm may be considerably hotter and their thermal state more complicated than usually assumed at these redshifts .",
    "radiative transfer effects during the epoch of heii reionization , which should occur at @xmath19 , are expected to play a non negligible role in setting this temperature - density relation . indeed ,",

    "an investigation of the flux probability distribution at redshifts around @xmath22 or higher may therefore shed more light on the possible inversion of the temperature - density relation .",

    "the aim of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we perform a detailed study of the redshift evolution of the flux pdf across a wide redshift range .",

    ", we present the qso spectra and the data analysis , and in section 3 we present our measurements of the flux pdf and effective optical depth . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce the hydrodynamical simulations used to obtain constraints on the thermal state of the igm from the pdf and , in section 5 , we report the results from the analysis of the simulations .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present our conclusions .",
    "the data set used in this paper consists of eight high - redshift qso spectra .",
    "two of the spectra ( pks2126 - 158 and pks2000 - 330 ) were obtained with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) ( dekker et al .",

    "the largest effect is induced by using a different value of @xmath30 ( e.g. bolton et al . 2008 ) .",

    "we start with the a1@xmath34 simulation and proceed to calculate the @xmath35 of our models by varying all the parameters that alter the flux pdf , enabling us to expand around the fiducial starting model .",
    "the expansion method allows us to explore the parameter space close to the reference model with an accurate set of hydrodynamic simulations , even if the full parameter space can not be probed in this way with the same high accuracy .",
    "we impose weak priors on the effective optical depth evolution , but both its amplitude and slope are constrained strongly by the data , so the priors do not affect our results . in order to present a conservative analysis , we also decide to consider only the values of the flux in the range @xmath36 $ ] , as this range should not be affected much by the errors made in the continuum fitting procedure ( e.g. k07 ; bolton et al .",

    "( 2009 ) are shown as dashed blue lines .",
    "the joint constraints for both pdf measurements are plotted as the red lines . from this figure",
    "we can see that overall there is agreement between the inferred parameter values for the high redshift ( this work ) and low redshift ( k07 ) measurements .",
    "the @xmath37 parameter constraints from the sample of qsos analysed in this work and for the joint sample including the k07 data are summarized in tab .",
    "the minimum @xmath35 for the best fitting model to the pdf measured in this work is 52 for 38 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) which is likely to happen 7 per cent of the time .",
    "in contrast , for the joint sample the minimum @xmath35 is 94 for 83 d.o.f .",
    "with has a 21 per cent probability .",
    "the probability is calculated using the full covariance matrix for all the parameters recovered .",
    "note that the `` degrees of freedom '' value does not have a precise meaning if the error bars are heavily correlated .",
    "however , this happens not to be the case in the flux ranges considered here , @xmath38@xmath39 $ ] , where correlations are weak .",
    "we have also checked that there is good agreement between the derived constraints from the present data set when compared to constraints obtained by splitting the sample in two and three redshift bins .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig_evol ] we display the redshift evolution of the temperature at the mean density , @xmath40 , and the slope of the temperature - density relation , @xmath29 , inferred from our analysis .",
    "we use the broken power - law parameterization around @xmath6 introduced previously : @xmath41^{f^{\\rm        s}(z)}$ ] , where @xmath42 or @xmath29 , @xmath43 is the corresponding normalization factor at @xmath6 and @xmath44 is the slope of the relation ( see tab . 5 ) .",
    "the black solid lines in figure [ fig_evol ] are the results obtained from this work ( @xmath19 ) while the shaded blue regions show their associated errors .",
    "the red dot - dashed lines are the results obtained from the joint sample composed of this work and the k07 data .",
    "the red dashed lines show the associated errors .",
    "since the @xmath43 and @xmath45 parameters are correlated and the @xmath44 are in general poorly constrained , we define the error associated to @xmath46 , at a given redshift @xmath47 , as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the @xmath37 upper and lower limits on @xmath43 , and @xmath51 are the best fit values of the slope showed in tab .",
    "the temperature at mean density and its redshift evolution , shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig_evol ] , are not strongly constrained by the flux pdf , although our measurements are consistent with other recent analyses presented in the literature which hint that heii reionization may be completing around @xmath52 ( lidz et al .",
    "2010 , becker et al .",
    "however , the pdf constraints alone are not precise enough to draw conclusions about the timing and extent of heii reionization ; the flux pdf is a relatively insensitive to @xmath40 ( see e.g fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf_sim ] ) .",
    "alternative measurements from doppler widths ( schaye et al 2000 ) wavelets ( lidz et al .",
    "2010 ) or the curvature statistic ( becker et al .",
    "2011 ) are typically better suited for this measurement .    on the other hand ,",
    "the flux pdf is sensitive to the slope of the temperature - density relation , @xmath29 .",
    "the constraints displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_evol ] , based on the pdf measurements presented in this work , are formally consistent with an isothermal temperature - density relation at @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath53 ) , although the uncertainties remain large .",
    "a temperature - density relation which is close to isothermal may be expected if heii reionization was underway by @xmath6 ( e.g. schaye et al . 2000 , theuns et al .",
    "when combining our data with the k07 measurements at lower redshift , however , the inferred @xmath29 at @xmath6 is shifted to lower , inverted @xmath54 values , consistent with previous results based on the k07 data ( e.g. bolton et al .",
    "2008 , viel et al .",
    "this is because the k07 data is more constraining at @xmath55 due to the larger number of qsos in this sample , and for the simple power - law parameterisation we have assumed this also pushes our joint constraints to smaller @xmath29 values at @xmath56 .",
    "it has been suggested recently that an inverted temperature - density relation at may be explained by an igm which is volumetrically heated by tev emission from blazars ( e.g. chang et al . 2011 , puchwein et al 2011 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to conventional photo - ionization heating models which predict a temperature - density relation which evolves from isothermal to @xmath57 following reionization ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "we caution , however , the uncertainties on the flux pdf measurements are still large ; the temperature - density relation suggested by the radiative transfer simulations of mcquinn et al . ( 2011 ) , @xmath58 at @xmath6 , is compatible at the @xmath21 level with the value derived from the sample considered in this work alone .",
    "the k07 data alone are furthermore consistent with an isothermal igm , again to within @xmath21 ( viel et al .",
    "we conclude that tighter constraints on @xmath29 from larger data sets , as well as a comparison of different measurement techniques to aid with the identification possible systematics , will be required for distinguishing between different igm heating scenarios .",
    "in this paper , we have measured the lyman @xmath0  forest flux pdf from a set of eight qso spectra to investigate the thermal state of the igm at @xmath5 .",
    "the absorption lines in the lyman @xmath0 forest have been fitted with voigt profiles , and absorption lines arising from heavy elements have been carefully identified .",
    "the spectra have then subsequently had the metal absorption lines removed from within the lyman @xmath0  forest .",
    "the resulting masked spectra have been used to study the redshift evolution of the lyman @xmath0 forest flux distribution and the evolution of the hi effective optical depth .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* by removing metals from the lyman @xmath0  forest , we attempt to eliminate pixels which will introduce a systematic uncertainty into our measurement of the flux pdf .",
    "the effect of removing these metals on the pdf is to decrease the number of pixels in bins of low flux and increase the number of pixels in bins of high flux . as a result ,",
    "the pdf measured after correcting for metal absorption is slightly steeper than the pdf measured without removing metals . in general , the effect of metal removal on the pdf is strongest for flux bins at @xmath59 , in agreement with previous results for other qso samples at lower redshift ( k07 ) . +",
    "* we measure the pdf for our full sample in two redshift bins , both before and after metal decontamination , and find the effect of metal absorption on the lyman @xmath0  forest flux pdf is redshift dependent .",
    "it is more significant at lower redshift , where the average opacity of the lyman @xmath0 forest is lower and there are fewer absorption lines .",
    "this redshift dependence may be understood in terms of the larger number of metal lines which are blended with lyman @xmath0 absorption lines toward higher redshift , resulting in the identification of fewer isolated metal absorption lines . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the metallicity of the intergalactic medium decreases with increasing lookback time . + * we present measurements of the effective optical depth , @xmath2 , from our qso sample , which provides a probe of the igm which is complementary to the pdf .",
    "the values of @xmath2 measured from the qsos in our sample can be fitted with a power - law @xmath60 , in agreement with previous measurements by k07 after correcting for metal absorption .",
    "we also find no substantial evidence for a deviation from a power law in the @xmath61 plane at @xmath62 .",
    "+ there is a weak redshift dependence of the ratio of the hi effective optical depth measured before and after removing identified metal absorption lines .",
    "the ratio increases toward lower redshift , and is consistent with our previous finding from the pdf that metal absorption plays a more significant role in the lyman @xmath0   forest toward lower redshift . + * we perform a set of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations with a range of cosmological and astrophysical parameters and use them to extract mock qso spectra with properties that closely resemble those of the observed spectra .",
    "we compute the lyman @xmath0  flux pdf and compare it to the observed pdf in the range @xmath38@xmath39 $ ] via a taylor expansion at second order to find deviations from a best - guess case ( e.g. viel & haehnelt 2006 ) . by implementing this method within a monte carlo markov chain likelihood estimator , we present constraints for the igm thermal state . at @xmath6 ,",
    "our pdf measurements are consistent with an isothermal temperature - density relation , @xmath9 , and a temperature at the mean density of @xmath63 k ( 1@xmath10 uncertainties ) .",
    "+ * we also obtain joint constraints on the igm thermal state by analysing the lower redshift pdf measurements of k07 , which is a significantly larger data set than the one considered here . at @xmath6 , we find the joint data set is consistent with an inverted temperature - density relation , @xmath64 , with @xmath65 k ( 1@xmath10 uncertainties ) . + * in conclusion , the present work highlights the role of the flux pdf as a competitive and quantitative thermometer which may be used to constraint the igm temperature - density relation over a wide redshift range .",
    "the constraints derived from the present work are complementary with respect to other approaches , such as the wavelets method ( lidz et al .",
    "2010 ) , the cutoff in the doppler width - column density plane ( schaye et al .",
    "2000 ) or the curvature ( becker et al . 2011 ) , which are primarily sensitive to higher density regions of the igm at @xmath5 . in the near future ,",
    "the most promising route to making further progress on our knowledge of the thermal state of the igm will be to carefully compare and contrast results from these different probes of the igm temperature - density relation .",
