    "in the past 25 years , loop quantum gravity(lqg ) , a background independent approach to quantize general relativity ( gr ) , has been widely investigated @xcite . recently",
    ", this non - perturbatively loop quantization procedure has been generalized to the metric @xmath2 theories@xcite .",
    "in fact , modified gravity theories have recently received increased attention in issues related to `` dark universe '' and non - trivial tests on gravity beyond gr . besides @xmath2 theories , a well - known competing relativistic theory of gravity was proposed by brans and dicke in 1961 @xcite , which is apparently compatible with mach s principle . to represent a varying `` gravitational constant '' ,",
    "a scalar field is non - minimally coupled to the metric in brans - dicke theories(bdt ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since 1998 , a series of independent observations implied that our universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion@xcite .",
    "these results have caused the `` dark energy '' problem in the framework of gr .",
    "it is reasonable to consider the possibility that gr is not a valid theory of gravity on a galactic or cosmological scale . the scalar field in bdt of gravity",
    "is then expected to account for `` dark energy '' .",
    "furthermore , a large part of the non - trivial tests on gravity theory is related to einstein s equivalence principle ( eep ) @xcite .",
    "there exist many local experiments in solar - system supporting eep , which implies the metric theories of gravity . actually , bdt are a class of representative metric theories , which have been received most attention .",
    "thus it is interesting to see whether this class of metric theories of gravity could be quantized nonperturbatively .",
    "note that the metric @xmath2 theories are equivalent to the special kind of bdt with the coupling parameter @xmath3 and some non - vanishing potential of the scalar field@xcite . in this work , for simplicity consideration ,",
    "we only consider bdt with coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the connection formalism of bdt is derived from its geometrical dynamics .",
    "based on the resulted connection dynamical formalism , we then quantize the bdt by extending the nonperturbative quantization procedure of lqg in the way similar to loop quantum @xmath2 gravity . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use greek alphabet for spacetime indices , latin alphabet a , b , c , ... , for spatial indices , and i , j , k , ... , for internal indices .",
    "the original action of brans - dicke theories reads s(g)=12_d^4x[-(_)^][action ] where we set @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the scalar curvature of spacetime metric @xmath6 , the hamiltonian analysis of bdt can be found in refs.@xcite . by doing 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime",
    ", the four - dimensional scalar curvature can be expressed as = k_abk^ab - k^2+r+_(n^k)-_a ( h^ab_bn),where @xmath7 is the extrinsic curvature of a spatial hypersurface @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the scalar curvature of the 3-metric @xmath11 induced on @xmath8 , @xmath12 is the unit normal of @xmath8 and @xmath13 is the lapse function . by legendre transformation , the momenta conjugate to the dynamical variables @xmath11 and @xmath14 are defined respectively as p^ab&=&=[(k^ab - kh^ab)-(-n^c_c ) ] , [ 04 ] + & = & = -(k-(-n^c_c)),[pi ] where @xmath15 is the shift vector .",
    "the resulted hamiltonian of bdt can be derived as a liner combination of constraints as @xmath16 where the smeared diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints read respectively v()&=&_d^3xn^av_a = _ d^3xn^a(-2d^b(p_ab)+_a),[dc ] + h(n ) & = & _ d^3xn.[hc ] + here the condition @xmath17 was assumed .",
    "lengthy but straightforward calculations show that the constraints comprise a first - class system similar to gr .",
    "since the geometric canonical variables @xmath18 of bdt are as same as those of @xmath2 theories @xcite , we can use the same canonical transformations of @xmath2 theories to obtain the connection dynamical formalism of bdt .",
    "let ^ab = k^ab+(-n^c_c).the new geometric variables are @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the triad such that @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the spin connection determined by @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a nonzero real number .",
    "it is clear that our new variable @xmath27 coincides with the ashtekar - barbero connection @xcite when @xmath28 .",
    "the only non - zero poisson brackets among the new variables reads @xmath29 now , the phase space of bdt consists of conjugate pairs @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the additional gaussian constraint @xmath32 which justifies @xmath27 as an @xmath1-connection .",
    "the original vector and hamiltonian constraints can be respectively written up to gaussian constraint as v_a & = & 1f^i_abe^b_i+_a , + h&= & + & + & 13 + 2(+ 2 + ) + ( d_a ) d^a+d_ad^a,[hamilton ] where @xmath33}+\\epsilon^i_{kl}a_a^ka_b^l$ ] is the curvature of @xmath34 .",
    "all the constraints are of first class .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination @xmath35    based on the connection dynamical formalism , the nonperturbative loop quantization procedure can be straightforwardly extended to the bdt .",
    "the kinematical structure of bdt is as same as that of @xmath2 theories @xcite .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space of the system is a direct product of the hilbert space of geometry and that of scalar field , @xmath36 , with the orthonormal spin - scalar - network basis @xmath37 over some graph @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 consist of finite number of curves and points respectively in @xmath8 .",
    "the basic operators are the quantum analogue of holonomies @xmath41 of connections , densitized triads smeared over 2-surfaces @xmath42 , point holonomis @xmath43@xcite , and scalar momenta smeared on 3-dimensional regions @xmath44 .",
    "note that the whole construction is background independent , and the spatial geometric operators of lqg , such as the area @xcite , the volume @xcite and the length operators @xcite are still valid here . as in lqg",
    ", it is straightforward to promote the gaussian constraint @xmath45 to a well - defined operator@xcite .",
    "it s kernel is the internal gauge invariant hilbert space @xmath46 with gauge invariant spin - scalar - network basis .",
    "since the diffeomorphisms of @xmath8 act covariantly on the cylindrical functions in @xmath47 , the so - called group averaging technique can be employed to solve the diffeomorphism constraint@xcite .",
    "thus we can also obtain the desired diffeomorphism and gauge invariant hilbert space @xmath48 for the bdt .",
    "now , we come to implement the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamilton ] ) at quantum level . in order to compare the hamiltonian constraint of bdt with that of @xmath2 theories in connection formalism , we write eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) as @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to see that the terms @xmath50 just keep the same form as those in @xmath2 theories , the @xmath51 terms are also similar to the corresponding terms in @xmath2 theories . here",
    "differences are only reflected by the coefficients .",
    "now we come to the completely new term , @xmath52 .",
    "we can introduce well - defined operators @xmath53 as in ref . @xcite . by the same regularization techniques as in refs.@xcite , we triangulate @xmath8 in adaptation to some graph @xmath39 underling a cylindrical function in @xmath54 and reexpress connections by holonomies .",
    "the corresponding regulated operator @xmath55 can acts on a basis vector @xmath56 over some graph @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that the action of @xmath55 on @xmath58 is graph changing .",
    "it adds a finite number of vertices at @xmath59 for edges @xmath60 starting from each high - valent vertex of @xmath39 . as a result",
    ", the family of operators @xmath61 fails to be weakly convergent when @xmath62 .",
    "however , due to the diffeomorphism covariant properties of the triangulation , the limit operator can be well defined via the so - called uniform rovelli - smolin topology induced by diffeomorphism - invariant states @xmath63 .",
    "it is obviously that the limit is independent of @xmath64 .",
    "hence the regulators can be removed . we then have _ 6t_,x & = & _ vv()^-1(v ) + & & _",
    "v()=v()=v(s_l s_m s_n)^lmn^-1__0((s_s_l ( ) ) ) [ _ _ 0((t_s_l()))-__0((s_s_l ( ) ) ) ] + & & ( _ i_s_m()[^-1_s_m(),(_v)^3/4 ] _ s_n()[^-1_s_n(),(_v)^3/4 ] ) + & & ( s_i s_j s_k)^ijk^-1__0((s_s_i( ) ) ) [ _ _ 0((t_s_i()))-__0((s_s_i( ) ) ) ] + & & ( _ i_s_j())[^-1_s_j(),(_v)^3/4 ] _ s_k()[^-1_s_k(),(_v)^3/4])t_,x .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian constraint operator @xmath65 is well defined in @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , master constraint programme can be introduced for bdt to avoid possible quantum anomaly and find the physical hilbert space@xcite .",
    "with the key observation that lqg is based on its @xmath1-connection dynamical formalism which can be derived via canonical transformations from the geometric dynamics , the @xmath1-connection dynamics of bdt is obtained .",
    "thus lqg has been successfully extended to the bdt by coupling to a polymer - like scalar field .",
    "the quantum kinematical structure of bdt is as same as that of loop quantum @xmath2 theories .",
    "hence the important physical result that both the area and the volume are discrete remains valid for quantum bdt .",
    "while the dynamics of bdt is more general than that of @xmath2 theories , the hamiltonian constraint can still be promoted to a well - defined operator in @xmath66 .",
    "hence the classical bdt can be non - perturbatively quantized .",
    "therefore , besides gr and @xmath2 theories , lqg method is also valid for the bdt of gravity .",
    "we thank the organizers of loops 11 conference for the financial support to our attendance .",
