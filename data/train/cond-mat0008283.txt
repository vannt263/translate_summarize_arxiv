    "the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions is a topic of growing interest due to its application to a variety of complex systems@xmath3 : contact process , domain growth , catalysis , phase separation and transport phenomena .",
    "although there is no general theory to account for nonequilibrium model systems , in recent years some progress has been achieved in understanding the stationary states of these systems employing approximate analytical methods and simulations .",
    "some rigorous mathematical questions concerning the phase transitions of these complex interacting particle systems can be appreciated in the books of liggett@xmath4 and konno@xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the phase transitions observed in the surface reaction model proposed by ziff , gulari and barshad@xmath6 ( zgb ) , which describes some kinetic aspects of the oxidation of @xmath7 over a catalytic surface .",
    "in particular , here we consider a modified version of the zgb model , where we incorporate a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface .",
    "the original zgb model is an irreversible lattice model for surface reactions based on the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism , where the reactants must be adsorbed before reacting .",
    "the steps used to describe the zgb model ( a lattice markov process ) are the following : molecules of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from a gaseous phase can be adsorbed onto the sites of a regular square lattice of identical sites .",
    "these molecules arrive at the surface according to their partial pressures in the gas mixture , that is , the probability of a @xmath0 molecule arriving is @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the @xmath1 molecule .",
    "the @xmath0 molecule requires only a single vacant site to be adsorbed , while the @xmath1 is adsorbed if it finds a nearest - neighbor pair of empty sites . upon adsorption , the @xmath1 molecule dissociates and the two free @xmath10 atoms can react independently . if , after an adsorption step , a nearest - neighbor @xmath11 pair appears on the lattice , they immediately react , forming a @xmath2 molecule that goes to the gas phase , leaving two empty sites on the lattice . therefore , in this adsorption controlled limit , only a single parameter ( @xmath8 ) is sufficient to describe the dynamics of the model .",
    "the simulations performed by ziff and co - workers have shown that the system exhibits two phase transitions between active and poisoned states : for @xmath12 , an o - poisoned state is formed , while for @xmath13 the lattice is poisoned by @xmath0 . for @xmath14 a reactive steady - state is found , in which a nonzero number of vacant sites is present in the lattice . at @xmath15",
    "the transition is continuous , whereas at @xmath16 the transition is of the first - order type . using a mean field theory , dickman@xmath17 qualitatively reproduced the phase diagram of the zgb model and showed that , at the level of site approximation , only the first - order transition appears .",
    "however , employing the pair approximation , both continuous and first - order transitions are obtained .",
    "we are interested on the effects of inert sites on the phase transitions of the zgb model .",
    "we have investigated in detail the dependence of the phase transitions on the concentration of inert sites .",
    "this problem presents some experimental interest in the automobile industry , where lead particles are deposited over the catalyst during the exhaust of the gases after combustion .",
    "this affects the efficiency of the catalytic surface due to the pinning of these lead particles on the surface , forbidding the adsorption of @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules at the lead positions and reducing the reaction paths .",
    "hovi and co - workers@xmath18 , have studied by computer simulations the effect of preadsorbed poison and promoters on the irreversible zgb model .",
    "they calculated the coverage of species as a function of the concentration of inert sites for a wide range of values , finding the interesting result that the first - order transition changes to a continuous one at a critical value of the concentration .",
    "corts and valencia@xmath19 have also reported some results concerning random impurities distributed over the catalyst , in which they observed the change of the first - order transition into a continuous one as one increases the concentration of impurities .",
    "albano@xmath20 simulated the zgb model on incipient percolation clusters ( ipc s ) with a fractal dimension of 1.90 .",
    "he showed that both transitions , at @xmath15 and @xmath16 are continuous , and that for an infinite lattice , in which @xmath8 is larger than 0.408 , the reactions stop at finite times because the ipc s are poisoned by pure @xmath0 .",
    "casties et al.@xmath21 also performed a monte carlo simulation of the @xmath0 oxidation on probabilistic fractals .",
    "they observed a change in the character of the transition at @xmath16 from first order on regular lattices to second order on percolation clusters ( for @xmath22 larger than @xmath23 , which is the percolation threshold on the square lattice ) .    in this work",
    "we have performed mean - field ( site and pair approximations ) calculations and monte carlo simulations for different values of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "the model studied here is a variant of the original zgb model , where inert sites are randomly distributed over the lattice .",
    "our approach is close related to that presented by vigil and willmore@xmath24 to study the effects of spatial correlations on the oscillatory behavior of a modified zgb model , where defects are continually added and desorbed from the surface . in their studies , they considered the mean - field site and pair approximations , as well as monte carlo simulations . in the present work we have determined the phase diagram for different concentrations , and the spinodal and transition lines as a function of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "we have constructed hysteresis curves to find the critical concentration at which the first - order transition changes into a continuous one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the results obtained within the site approximation ; in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the pair approximation equations and show the results obtained using this scheme ; sec .",
    "iv presents the results of simulations , and finally , in sec .",
    "v we present our conclusions .",
    "we take a square lattice as our catalytic surface .",
    "a fraction @xmath25 of the sites is randomly distributed over the lattice representing the pinned inert sites .",
    "the remaining sites of the lattice can be vacant , or occupied by either @xmath10 atoms or @xmath0 molecules .",
    "the zgb model is described by the following steps : @xmath26 where the labels @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the gaseous phase and an adsorbed reactant on the surface , respectively , and @xmath29 indicates a vacant site . steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) indicate the adsorption of the species , whereas the third step is the proper reaction , between distinct species located at adjacent sites of the lattice . in the site approximation the time evolution equations of the concentrations are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent , respectively , the coverages of @xmath10 , @xmath0 and blank sites in the lattice . @xmath8 gives the arrival probability of a @xmath0 molecule .",
    "in addition , there is the following constraint among the concentrations @xmath34    the steady - state solutions of the above system of equations are given by @xmath35 , that corresponds to a poisoned surface , and @xmath36 inserting eq .",
    "( 7 ) into eq .",
    "( 4 ) we obtain an expression for the steady - state values of the concentration @xmath32 : @xmath37    we exhibit in fig .",
    "1 a typical diagram for the coverages of @xmath0 , @xmath10 and vacant sites obtained for @xmath38 .",
    "this diagram was obtained by integrating the equations of motion for the @xmath32 and @xmath31 concentrations , starting from an initial condition in which the number of empty sites is @xmath39 .",
    "the site approximation does not give any continuous transition for all values of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "this was already pointed out by dickman@xmath17 for the zgb model without inert sites .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "1 , that the limit of stability of the reactive phase is @xmath40 , which corresponds to the spinodal point .",
    "therefore , a reactive steady - state is found for all values of @xmath41 . for values of @xmath42 ,",
    "the system becomes poisoned , with a large amount of @xmath0 and a small concentration of @xmath10 atoms .",
    "the presence of @xmath10 atoms in the region @xmath42 is due to the inert sites that can block some oxygen , and also to the simplicity of the site approximation , which does not forbid the formation of @xmath43 nearest - neighbor pairs in the lattice .",
    "the tolerance of these @xmath43 pairs also explains the absence of the continuous phase transition , which is observed in the simulations .",
    "2 is a plot of the solutions @xmath32 of eq.(8 ) versus the parameter @xmath44 for different values of concentration @xmath25 of inert sites .",
    "we obtain two solutions , which we call @xmath45 and @xmath46 , that join together at the spinodal point .",
    "for instance , for @xmath47 the value we find is @xmath48 , which furnishes the value @xmath49 .",
    "we also note in fig .",
    "2 that , at the spinodal point , the concentration of @xmath32 molecules remains the same irrespective of the value we choose for @xmath25 .",
    "this special value is @xmath50 .",
    "then , the net effect of adding @xmath25 is to shift the curves horizontally . in this site approximation , solutions are possible only for values of @xmath51 .",
    "this happens because above this value the solution would correspond to the non - physical value @xmath52 .",
    "so , the meaning of the two solutions in fig .",
    "2 is the following : the branch @xmath46 represents the stable steady - state solutions whereas the @xmath45 branch gives the unstable solutions .",
    "these solutions were obtained after numerical integration of the equations of motion for @xmath32 and @xmath31 , starting from the state described by @xmath39 . for the initial condition @xmath53 and @xmath32 larger than @xmath45 the system evolves to the poisoned state . the initial condition @xmath53 and @xmath32 less than @xmath45 drives the system to the lower stable reactive solution @xmath46 .    fig .",
    "2 also shows that , as we approach the spinodal point for any value of @xmath25 , the region of stability becomes narrower .",
    "then , we expect that for some value of @xmath41 a first - order transition occurs , that is , the concentration @xmath32 must increase abruptally from a small value ( reactive phase ) to a large value ( poisoned phase ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use here the usual thermodynamic considerations based on the minimization of a suitable thermodynamic potential . in order to find this first - order transition",
    "we adopt the same kinetic criteria employed by dickman@xmath17 , which was borrowed from the work of ziff et al@xmath6 .",
    "the phase transition was determined by choosing an initial state where half of the lattice was empty and the other half was completely filled with @xmath0 . in this work",
    "we choose as our initial state , to solve the equations of motion for @xmath32 and @xmath31 , the values @xmath54 .",
    "it is clear that this choice is not the same as that considered by ziff et al . , because we can not discriminate which sites are empty or not .",
    "the phase boundary is defined at the special value @xmath16 where the solution of the equations of motion changes from the reactive to the poisoned state as we vary the value of @xmath8 for the same initial condition , as established above .",
    "for @xmath47 we obtain the same value found by dickman . we exhibit in fig .",
    "3 the results obtained for the first - order transition and the spinodal points for @xmath38 .",
    "the spinodal was obtained from the initial condition @xmath39 , and the first - order transition from the condition @xmath54 .",
    "for this particular value of @xmath38 , we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have considered all values of the concentration of inert sites , and fig .",
    "4 shows the values of @xmath57 ( dashed line ) and @xmath16 ( full line ) as a function of the concentration of inert sites . at the particular value @xmath58",
    "the two lines merge . for values of @xmath59",
    "the transition still remains of the first - order type , although the number of vacant sites that stay in the active state is very small .",
    "for instance , for @xmath60 , at the transition point ( @xmath61 ) , the number of vacant sites changes from @xmath62 in the active state , to @xmath63 in the poisoned state . throughout our analysis",
    "we considered a given state to be active if the number of vacant sites is larger than @xmath64 .",
    "we also exhibit in fig .",
    "5 the number of vacant sites @xmath33 at the active state as a function of the number of inert sites @xmath25 , at the transition and spinodal points .",
    "we observe that for all values of @xmath65 , the number of vacant sites at the spinodal point is always larger than that at the transition point .",
    "let us consider the application of the pair approximation procedure to this zgb model that includes inert sites . here",
    "we introduce the pair probability @xmath66 of a random nearest neighbor pair of sites being occupied by species @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we have the following types of species : @xmath29 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath10 , which represent , respectively , vacant , inert , carbon monoxide , and oxygen . as in the previous treatments",
    "@xmath71 we need to consider only the changes that occur at a particular central pair in the lattice . in the table below we display the allowed and forbbiden ( indicated by @xmath72 ) nearest - neighbor pairs in the present model .",
    "@xmath73    the next table also exhibits all the possible transitions among pairs .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 independent transitions , labelled by numbers in the range @xmath75 . in the table transitions indicated by @xmath72",
    "are prohibited .",
    "@xmath76    then , we write the equations relating the probability of each element with the corresponding pair probabilities : @xmath77    the pair probabilities also satisfy the constraint @xmath78    next , we need to write the time evolution equations for the pair probabilities . examining the latter table we can construct the desired equations of evolution .",
    "we explicitly write the equations of motion for the pair probabilities @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 where @xmath81 to @xmath82 are the transition rates .",
    "the factors of two arising in the equation of motion for @xmath83 are due to the fact that the pair probabilities @xmath84 and @xmath85 are equal by symmetry . for instance , from the pair @xmath86 we can obtain , with the same probability , the different configurations @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in general , the expressions for the transition rates are lengthy , and we present these transition rates in the appendix .    in this pair approximation",
    "we can not obtain analytical solutions as we have done in the site approximation .",
    "we solved the coupled set of eight nonlinear equations by the fourth - order runge - kutta method , searching for the stationary solutions .",
    "we considered the two different initial conditions as in the case of the site approximation .",
    "let us first consider the evolution from the initial state where @xmath89 , in which only the pairs @xmath86 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are present in the lattice at @xmath92 .",
    "figure 6 shows the diagram of the model for @xmath93 . for @xmath94 the lattice poisons with oxygen . in the range @xmath95 there is an active region , and for @xmath96 the lattice poisons with @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath97 , we found the same figures obtained by dickman in his pair approximation .",
    "for instance , the site and pair approximations give the same value for the spinodal point @xmath57 .",
    "however , when we consider some inert sites in the lattice , the spinodal point found in the site approximation is always smaller than that obtained within the pair approximation . for this particular value , @xmath93 , the site approximation yields @xmath98 , whereas @xmath56 is obtained by the pair approximation .",
    "the value of @xmath8 at the continuous transition , which now arises in this pair approximation , decreases slightly with increasing values of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "we also considered the solutions evolving from an initial condition where half of the free sites ( @xmath89 ) is filled with @xmath0 molecules and the other half left empty . in order to be close to the initial condition used in the simulation , we chose for the initial pair conditions @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which mimics a division of the lattice into two parts : on one side of the lattice we would have inert sites and @xmath0 molecules and , on the other side , vacant and inert sites .",
    "if @xmath97 , we found for the transition between the active and co - poisoned states the value @xmath102 , which agrees with the value found in the simulations .",
    "7 displays the concentration of @xmath0 molecules at the transition point for which @xmath93 . in this pair approximation ,",
    "the values of @xmath57 and @xmath16 are very close .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "8 the concentration of vacant sites as a function of the concentration of inert sites , at the transition point , and also at the spinodal point .",
    "both curves join at @xmath103 , and for @xmath104 , we can not observe any active state . as in the site approximation , an active state",
    "is defined only if @xmath105 .",
    "then , the calculations performed within the pair approximation give results that are very similar to those obtained by the site approximation , concerning the spinodal and transition points .",
    "in addition , it was observed that initial conditions do not affect the point in which the continuous phase transition occurs . in fig .",
    "9 we exhibit the phase diagram for this zgb model with inert sites . the size of the reactive window decreases as we increase the concentration of inert sites .",
    "we have plotted the transition line for the first - order transition and for the spinodal line , which gives the limit of stability of the reactive phase .",
    "the line separating the active and o - poisoned phases is a continuous transition line .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations in the zgb model with inert sites in order to check the results we have obtained in the site and pair approximations .",
    "the simulations were carried for different values of the concentration of inert sites @xmath106 . for small values of @xmath106",
    ", we considered square lattices of linear size @xmath107 , but for large values of @xmath106 we have used lattices of linear size up to @xmath108 . the first step in the simulation is to randomly distribute the selected fraction @xmath106 of inert sites in the lattice .",
    "all simulations then started with a fraction of empty sites equal to @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath0 molecules arrive at the surface with a probability @xmath8 and the @xmath1 molecules with probability @xmath109 .",
    "the rules for adsorption and reaction of the species are exactly the same as in the original zgb model@xmath6 .",
    "since adsorption of oxygen requires two nearest neighbor empty sites , the effect of the inert sites is to favour the adsorption of @xmath0 relatively to that of @xmath1 molecules . in general , we have taken @xmath110 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) to attain the stationary states , and @xmath110 more to calculate the concentration averages at the stationary states .",
    "one mcs is equal to @xmath111 trials of deposition of species , where @xmath112 is the linear size of the lattice . to speed up the simulations we worked with a suitable list of empty sites .",
    "we exhibit in fig .",
    "10 the phase diagram of the model in the plane @xmath8 versus @xmath106 .",
    "it is similar to that obtained within the pair approximation .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between the transition line separating the active and co - poisoned phases in both approaches . in the pair approximation",
    "the transition line is always of the first - order type , whereas in the simulations there is a critical concentration above which the transition becomes continuous .",
    "we have done detailed simulations to find the critical concentration at which the transition becomes continuous .",
    "we have found for the critical concentration of inert sites the value @xmath113 .",
    "we arrived at this value by looking at the hysteresis loops in the curves of @xmath114 versus @xmath8 for different values of the concentration @xmath106 , as we can see in fig .",
    "we proceed as follows : in fig .",
    "11a we fixed the concentration of inert sites at the value @xmath115 and the curve with circles , which is the proper transition curve , was obtained from an initial state where @xmath89 , that is , with a lattice almost empty .",
    "the curve with squares was determined from an initial state in which the lattice was almost covered by @xmath0 .",
    "we have taken a fraction of only @xmath116 of randomly empty sites over the lattice at the starting time .",
    "then , we clearly observe the hysteresis loop at the concentration @xmath106 , which implies that the transition is of first - order . on the other hand , fig .",
    "11b , where the fraction of inert sites is @xmath117 , does not exhibit the hysteresis loop and the transition is clearly a continuous one .",
    "the critical value of @xmath113 was obtained analysing the behavior of these curves in the range @xmath118 . as we have pointed out in the introduction , hovi et al.@xmath18 had already observed the change in the nature of this transition as a function of the concentration .",
    "the phase boundary separating the active and the o - poisoned phases in fig .",
    "10 is continuous for all values of @xmath106 .",
    "we have checked this fact by observing that no hysteresis loop was found for any value of @xmath106 .",
    "the width of the active phase decreases with increasing values of @xmath106 . for values of @xmath119",
    "the lattice is poisoned ( absence of empty sites ) with different amounts of @xmath0 and @xmath10 species . due to finite size effects , this value is larger than the value 0.408 found by albano@xmath20 in the limit of very large ipc s .    we have also noted that the production rate of @xmath2 molecules attains its maximum value exactly at the first - order transition , for values of @xmath120 . if @xmath121 the maximum production rate of @xmath2 molecules is located inside of the reactive window .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "12 , where the circles indicate the points where the production rate of @xmath2 is maximum . in the site and",
    "pair approximations this maximum occurs always at the phase boundary , irrespective of the value of @xmath106 .",
    "13 shows the production rate @xmath122 of @xmath2 molecules as a function of @xmath106 .",
    "as expected , the role of inert sites is also of blocking the reactions over the catalyst .",
    "the maximum production rate occurs at a surface free of impurities .",
    "we have studied the effects of a random distribution of inert sites on the phase diagram of the zgb model .",
    "we determined the time evolution equations for the concentrations of the different species over the catalytic surface within an effective field theory , at the level of site and pair approximations , and also performed monte carlo simulations on the model .",
    "we obtained the coverages of the species as function of the deposition rate of @xmath0 and of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "in the site and pair approximations we found the transition line and the limit of stability of the reactive phase . in the site approximation ,",
    "the continuous transition between the o - poisoned and reactive states is absent for any values of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "the width of the reactive window exhibits the same behavior , as a function of concentration of inert sites , in both pair approximation and monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , the transition between the reactive and co - poisoned phase is always of first - order in the site and pair approximations , whereas monte carlo simulations give a critical point where the transition changes nature . for values of the concentration of inert sites",
    "less than the critical value , the transition is first - order and above this value , it changes to a continuous one .",
    "the determination of this critical concentration was possible through the analysis of the hysteresis curves for different values of the concentration of inert sites .",
    "the production rate of @xmath2 molecules is maximum at the first - order transition , in both site and pair approximations .",
    "this is the case in the simulations , but the transition is of the first - order type .",
    "when the concentration of inert sites is greater than the critical value , the maximum production rate of @xmath2 molecules moves towards the reactive window .",
    "the overall effect of inert sites is to reduce the production of @xmath2 molecules .",
    "we would like to thank ron dickman by his many valuable suggestions , and luis g. c. rego by the critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by the brazilian agencies capes , cnpq and finep .",

    "<S> the adsorption of @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules is not possible at the position of the inert sites . </S>",
    "<S> this model is investigated in the site and pair approximations , as well as through monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the mean coverages of the elements as a function of the dilution and show that the continuous transition between the active and o - poisoned state is slightly affected by moderate values of dilution in the pair approximation and in the simulations . on the other hand , from the analysis of the hysteresis curves , the transition between the active and co - poisoned states changes from first - order to continuous as one increases the concentration of inactive sites . </S>",
    "<S> the observed transition in the site and pair approximations is always of first - order nature . </S>",
    "<S> we also found the lines of transition and spinodal points as a function of the concentration of inert sites . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the production rate of @xmath2 is calculated as a function of the dilution of sites .    </S>",
