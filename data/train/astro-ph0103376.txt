    "kr  140 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; kallas & reich 1980 ) is a small ( 5.7 pc diameter ) region located in the perseus arm of the galaxy at a distance of 2.3@xmath10.3 kpc ( kerton , ballantyne , & martin 1999 ) .",
    "it is close to , but apparently isolated from , the w3/4/5 star formation complex .",
    "the region is ionized by ves  735 , an o8.5  v(e ) star @xcite .",
    "it has been the subject of a recent multiwavelength study ( ballantyne , kerton , & martin 2000 ) utilizing the data set of the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ; taylor 1999 ) .",
    "surrounding the region are six iras point sources ( see table  [ tbl : iras ] and figure  [ fig : radioir ] ; there is a faint source coincident with ves  735 as well ) .",
    "these are the brightest sources within several square degrees , suggestive of a region of enhanced star formation .",
    "in particular , infrared point sources located at the periphery of regions are of interest because they may be associated with star formation induced by the expansion of the region ( e.g. , sugitani , fukui , & ogura 1991 ) .",
    "characterization of these sources is important in order to form a complete picture of the star formation history in that area .    determining the true nature of these sources",
    "is hampered by the low resolution of the commonly available iras image products : @xmath7 for the infrared sky survey atlas ( issa , wheelock et al .",
    "1994 ) , and @xmath8 ( after hires reprocessing ) for the iras galaxy atlas ( iga , cao et al .",
    "1997 ) and mid - infrared galaxy atlas ( miga , kerton & martin 2000 ) . at these resolutions",
    "a collection of objects can appear as a single point source .",
    "moreover , areas of extended dust shells surrounding regions can be misidentified as point sources . while the iras colors can be used as a general guide to the nature of the source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) they can sometimes be misleading ( see sections  [ sec : irasnorthwest ] and [ sec : bstar ] ) .    moving from the infrared wavelengths observed by iras to the submillimeter yields two advantages .",
    "first , the current generation of submillimeter mapping bolometers have far better resolution than the iras data and sufficient sensitivity to allow star formation regions at the distance of kr  140 to be investigated .",
    "second , the submillimeter observations are sensitive to colder dust not detected by iras and thus allow a more complete picture of the dust distribution .",
    "the observations we have obtained have both clarified the nature of the iras point sources surrounding kr  140 and have led to the discovery of new discrete sources not visible in the iras data .    in section  [ sec : observations ] the observations are described .",
    "data analysis techniques are outlined in section  [ sec : analysis ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ] the results of the analysis are discussed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "the observations were obtained through the canserv service observing program at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) using the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba , holland et al .",
    "observations using scuba in its `` jiggle map '' mode were obtained in december 1997 and observations in the larger - scale `` scan mapping '' mode were obtained in july 1998 .",
    "scuba was used to acquire 450  @xmath0 m and 850  @xmath0 m data simultaneously . at these wavelengths",
    "the beam can be approximated as a gaussian with a fwhm of about 8@xmath9 at 450  @xmath0 m and 14.5@xmath9 at 850  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the main beam solid angle ( @xmath10 ) can then be calculated using the standard formula @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "jiggle mapping , being closely related to pointed observations , allows users to make images of objects on the scale of the scuba field of view , @xmath12 .",
    "the northwest rim of kr  140 was selected as the target for the initial jiggle maps because the brightest infrared source ( iras  02160 + 6057 ) is located there ( see section  [ sec : irasnorthwest ] for the analysis of this source ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : jigmap ] shows the resulting jiggle maps ( @xmath13 in size ) .",
    "a chop throw of @xmath14 with a position angle of 135@xmath15 was used to obtain a reasonable sky estimate by avoiding bright infrared emission associated with the region .",
    "beam sizes of 8.5@xmath9 and 14.5@xmath9 were achieved for this set of observations .",
    "the average normalized sky transparency during the observations was 0.81 at 850 @xmath0 m and 0.34 at 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "the expected noise equivalent flux density per pixel for the bolometer arrays is approximately 0.08 and 0.95  jy  hz@xmath16 at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m respectively @xcite .",
    "the measured noise levels in the maps are @xmath17 jy / beam and @xmath18 jy / beam at 850 and 450  @xmath0 m respectively , consistent with the expectations from sky transparency and bolometer characteristics .",
    "there are no strong point sources visible in either map .",
    "instead , extended emission is quite evident in the 850 @xmath0 m map ( s / n @xmath19 48 ) .",
    "the same region of emission is barely visible in the 450 @xmath0 m map .",
    "however , convolving the image to the 850 @xmath0 m resolution reduces the noise level to 0.05 jy/(850 @xmath0 m beam ) and results in the extended emission being clearly visible ( s / n @xmath19 37 ) .",
    "larger scale maps of kr  140 at 450/850  @xmath0 m were obtained in july 1998 using the recently ( at the time ) developed `` scan mapping '' observing mode which allows larger areas to be mapped out by scanning the array across the sky .",
    "these maps included the jiggle - map region and enabled the study of the other iras point sources near kr  140 .",
    "the raw bolometer data were reduced using the standard scuba software @xcite for flatfield and extinction corrections .",
    "the data were then further reduced and transformed into the final maps using a matrix inversion technique @xcite which effectively minimizes the difference between the individual chop measurements and the resulting map .",
    "one advantage of this technique compared to standard reductions is that the bolometer input may be weighted to account for variations in the quality of the measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : scanmaps ] shows maps created at this stage .",
    "weiner filtering these maps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) removes the high ( spatial ) frequency noise associated with the individual chop measurements without affecting structure on scales equal to or larger than the jcmt beam .",
    "further processing of the map proves useful . due to the finite chop size ,",
    "scuba maps have their low spatial frequency modes suppressed .",
    "restoring these modes requires a large re - amplification which also amplifies any existing low frequency noise .",
    "furthermore , correlated errors introduced by variations in the sky opacity and the drift in the bolometer response produce excess residual low frequency modes .",
    "thus the large scale structure in the map is less reliable , and in order to better visualize the small scale features in the data , the low frequency modes were entirely suppressed .",
    "this was achieved by convolving the filtered map with a @xmath20 gaussian beam ( twice the largest chop throw ) and then subtracting the convolved map from the original to remove any large - scale structure .",
    "both images were then brought to a common 20@xmath9 resolution to facilitate comparison . in figure",
    "[ fig : scanmapsmooth ] the resultant maps are displayed .",
    "noise levels are @xmath19 0.01 jy / beam and 0.05 jy / beam at 850 and 450  @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : scancomp ] compares the derived 850  @xmath0 m scan map for the region with other data obtained from the cgps database ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "our quantitative analysis focuses on the discrete sources detected in our maps .",
    "the next three subsections describe how the sources were detected , and the subsequent measurements of flux , size , temperature , mass and density for these objects .",
    "interpretation of these results is presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "individual sources were identified through a combination of visual inspection of the maps , and by using a 2d version of the automated clump finding algorithm clumpfind @xcite which separates objects along minimum flux surfaces within the map . in total 22 sources were detected ; 11 at both 850 and 450  @xmath0 m , nine sources at only 850  @xmath0 m , and two at only 450  @xmath0 m .",
    "these last two sources may be visible at 850  @xmath0 m but it is hard to be certain because of the increased noise at that location due to edge effects from processing .",
    "the flux - weighted centroid of each source was determined and used as a measure of the source position .",
    "we have assigned the acronym kmjb to these new submillimeter sources . except for one of our sources ( kmjb  1 = iras 02174 + 6052 ) detected near the edge of the map",
    ", there was no significant difference in the centroid positions between the two observed wavelengths ( when applicable ) .",
    "for kmjb 1 we have reported the 850  @xmath0 m centroid position because of the higher quality of the data .",
    "table  [ tbl : sources ] lists the positions of the sources indicated by the white crosses in figure  [ fig : scanmapsmooth ] .    in order to estimate the size of the sources",
    ", an azimuthally averaged gaussian profile was fitted to each source using the image analysis program kview @xcite . to take into account the beam size ,",
    "a simple convolution of a gaussian source with a gaussian beam was assumed , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "physical sizes ( @xmath23 ) were calculated assuming a distance @xmath240.3 kpc to kr  140 and tabulated in table  [ tbl : sources ] .",
    "the effective diameters range from 0.7 pc down to the resolution limit , 0.1  0.2 pc .",
    "this size scale of a few @xmath25 0.1 pc is typical for cores observed within molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "flux measurements of the sources were obtained using the imview software package .",
    "the uncertainty in each measurement is dominated by the uncertainty in choosing a correct background level . to quantify this uncertainty , we interactively selected three different bounding polygons for each source , and used two different functional forms for the background ( twisted plane and twisted quadratic ) which were fit to the boundary points of the polygon .",
    "the six resulting flux measurements were then averaged together and the standard deviation of the measurements was calculated and used as a conservative uncertainty estimate .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tbl : sources ] .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the dust emission was parameterized using what we call a `` bluebody '' spectrum after dent , matthews , & ward - thompson ( 1998 ) : a single temperature planck function with a @xmath26 dependence ( @xmath27 ) for the dust emissivity .",
    "while this is clearly a gross oversimplification of the dust properties @xcite and @xcite point out that the quantities derived from these simple fits are often consistent with results derived from a more complex , and often non - unique , analysis of the data .",
    "for the isolated sources detected by iras , this sed was fit to the submillimeter and 100 and 60 @xmath0 m iras data .",
    "however , for two sources , iras  02168 + 6052 and iras  02157 + 6053 , this technique was not possible because of the significant beam size difference between iras and scuba : multiple submillimeter sources were detected within the larger iras beam . in these cases , and for sources without iras counterparts , the submillimeter photometry was used where possible to derive a 450/850  @xmath0 m bluebody color temperature .",
    "this estimate can be rough for two reasons .",
    "for warmer dust , one is out on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the planck function which is relatively insensitive to temperature .",
    "the calculated temperature for colder dust is still very uncertain due to the relatively poor quality of the 450  @xmath0 m data .    for sources detected at only a single wavelength representative masses",
    "were calculated using a temperature of 20 k , as has been done in other single wavelength analyses of millimeter and submillimeter data ( e.g. , johnstone et al .",
    "2000b , motte , andr , & neri 1998 ) .",
    "this temperature is a typical value observed for compact dust features found by submillimeter studies of the orion molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl : sources ] summarizes the mass and density estimates .",
    "the mass calculation used the standard formulation of @xcite for an optically thin molecular cloud with a uniform temperature : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total ( dust and gas ) cloud mass , @xmath30 is the distance to the objects , @xmath31 is the observed flux density , @xmath32 is the planck function evaluated at dust temperature @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a factor combining the dust opacity ( @xmath35 ) and the dust to gas mass ratio ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : cvals ] summarizes various values of @xmath37 derived from the literature .",
    "most of the articles cited report the value of @xmath34 at 1  mm , and the values shown have been calculated assuming that @xmath38 ( @xmath27 for the opacity ) .",
    "the canonical @xcite value is derived from the observations of the reflection nebula ngc 7023 ( hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "while this is empirically derived , ideally it should be applied to observed objects which have similar properties to the calibration object @xcite ; this is probably not the case here where we find lower temperatures and higher densities .",
    "the @xcite value is appropriate for dust in the general ism ; however , it is known that properties of dust in dense clouds differ from those in the diffuse ism ( kim , martin , & hendry 1994 ) .",
    "the difference in optical properties arises from a combination of coagulation , leading to an increase in grain porosity , and the accretion of volatile grain mantles .",
    "the remaining values in the table are from various models that have attempted to deal directly with these processes .",
    "various authors suggest different values ranging at 850  @xmath0 m from 21  86 g @xmath39 , depending upon the gas density and temperature . since we do not know the density in advance we have adopted a value of @xmath40 g @xmath39 at 850@xmath41 m and , assuming a @xmath27 dust emissivity , @xmath42 g @xmath39 at 450@xmath41 m for this investigation .",
    "this is in general agreement with the results of a recent detailed observational study of circumstellar material by @xcite .",
    "the masses derived in our study range from 0.7 to 130  m@xmath2 .",
    "they can be linearly scaled to another value of @xmath34 if desired .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance to kr  140 leads to a systematic 26% uncertainty in the derived masses .",
    "the average tabulated uncertainty in the flux density measurements is 17% at 850  @xmath0 m and 28% at 450",
    "@xmath0 m . uncertainties relating to the derived temperature are harder to quantify because of the simple bluebody model that we have used and because the temperature enters into the mass derivation non - linearly through the planck function .",
    "figure  [ fig : terr ] shows the change in the mass derived from 850  @xmath0 m flux measurements produced by varying the temperature . at lower temperatures the derived mass is very sensitive to the temperature .",
    "for example , reducing the temperature by only 2  k will cause the derived mass to almost double . the same absolute change at 15  k causes an increase of only 28% and at 25  k the change is only 12% . based upon these considerations",
    "a total uncertainty ( not including the uncertainties in @xmath34 ) for the derived masses of @xmath43% is an optimistic minimum value ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for each source",
    "the cube of @xmath44 was taken as a rough estimate of the volume and used to calculate a density .",
    "considering both the lack of information about the true three - dimensional structure of the sources and the uncertainty in the masses , these densities should be considered as only order of magnitude estimates .",
    "in this section we first consider what the new submillimeter observations can tell us about the nature of the iras point sources , drawing on the multifrequency data available .",
    "discussion about the newly detected sources and the region as a whole follow in sections  [ sec : massfunc ] , [ sec : bonnor ] and [ sec : trigstar ] .",
    "the source iras  02160 + 6057 identified with the north - west dust arc has been the subject of two molecular line investigations",
    ". @xcite identified it as a potential star - forming area via its iras colors ( see their paper for the exact selection criteria ) and examined it ( along with about 1300 other iras point sources ) for co emission .",
    "they found a co feature in that direction at a velocity of @xmath4549.7  km  s@xmath46 ( lsr ) , which corresponds to co in the associated background molecular cloud @xcite , and assigned it the catalog number [ wb89]417 .",
    "this point source was not detected in a subsequent h@xmath47o line survey by wouterloot , brand , & fiegle ( 1993 ) .",
    "a comparison of the scan maps with the iras images of kr  140 for this region provides a striking example of how much the morphology of the dust emission associated with an region can change with wavelength . in the iras images this region at all bands ( figure  [ fig : scancomp ] ; ballantyne et al .",
    "2000 , figure  2 ) is the dominant feature .",
    "in contrast , while the feature is visible in the submillimeter maps it is certainly not the dominant one .",
    "this contrast indicates that the dust emission one sees from this area is from relatively hot dust with no additional cool components along the line of sight .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of significant clumped co emission in this area which could have indicated a region containing colder dust grains ( see figure  [ fig : scancomp ] ) .",
    "the submillimeter and infrared emission are also aligned spatially which is what we would expect if the submillimeter emission is just coming from the hot dust we see in the iras bands ( see figure  [ fig : jigmap ] ) .",
    "morphologically , iras  02160 + 6057 appears to be part of the partial dust shell surrounding kr  140 .",
    "this line of sight has one of the highest column densities of _ warm _ dust in the kr  140 region and so it is possible that a protostar could be forming there as a result of the expansion of the region .",
    "however , examination of the hires images shows no point - like features in the dust arc and none are found in the new submillimeter observations .    the average mean flux density at 850  @xmath0 m is @xmath48 jy in the jiggle map and @xmath49 jy in the scan map .",
    "for our calculations we have used 0.8@xmath10.2  jy as the flux density at 850  @xmath0 m . at 450  @xmath0 m we used the flux density from the jiggle maps , @xmath50 jy , since the feature is not seen in the 450  @xmath0 m scan maps . in order to construct an sed for the source we measured infrared flux densities in the same region at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m using hires images of kr  140 .",
    "we found f@xmath51  jy and f@xmath52  jy . combining this infrared data with the submillimeter data we obtain a best - fit bluebody curve to the sed with t@xmath53  k",
    "( see figure  [ fig : sourcesed ] ) .",
    "comparison with the azimuthally averaged dust temperatures for kr  140 ( see figure  5 in ballantyne et al.2000 ) , shows that our derived temperature is consistent with dust being heated by the central star ves  735 .",
    "we conclude that iras  02160 + 6057 is not a point source but simply part of the dust shell associated with kr  140 .",
    "this naturally explains the non - detection of h@xmath47o in the @xcite study .",
    "using equation 1 we find a mass of 9 m@xmath2 in this segment of the shell ; the density there is 10@xmath54 @xmath55 , the lowest for all of the sources and would be even lower if allowance were made for limb brightening ( line of sight distance @xmath56 ) .",
    "the structure of this dust shell ( morphology , density , temperature ) was examined in detail in section  6 of @xcite .      at submillimeter wavelengths",
    "the region around the single iras point source iras 02168 + 6052 contains three sources ( see figure  [ fig : eastshell ] ) .",
    "the brightest submillimeter source in the area ( kmjb 8) is well off the 60  @xmath0 m centroid and is associated with the co emission .",
    "it is also detectable at 450  @xmath0 m .",
    "the resulting color temperature is 8@xmath12 k. this leads to a mass of 80 m@xmath2 and a density of 10@xmath57  @xmath55 .",
    "kmjb 6 breaks up into three discrete objects at 450  @xmath0 m .",
    "we calculated a 450/850 color temperature using the combined flux of the sources at 450 and the measured flux density at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "the derived dust temperature is 7@xmath12 k. the corresponding mass is about 55 m@xmath2 , and the overall density in this region is around 10@xmath58  @xmath55 .",
    "kmjb 6 and 8 are most likely cold molecular cores ; however , the very cold temperatures derived for these objects should be confirmed with future spectral line observations .",
    "kmjb 7 is located near the position of iras  02168 + 6052 and is most likely a dense knot of dust and gas within the dust shell surrounding kr  140 .",
    "like in kmjb 15 , the shell is the source of the prominent ridge of emission seen in all of the iras emission bands .",
    "faint submillimeter emission from the dust shell is visible as a diffuse ridge running between kmjb 6 and 8 .",
    "the temperature of dust within this shell was measured to be around 30  k @xcite , which is consistent with the ratio of 60 and 100  @xmath0 m to 850  @xmath0 m fluxes . using this dust temperature we derive a mass of 1 m@xmath2 for the knot that is kmjb 7 .",
    "this region ( see figure  [ fig : region5 ] ) is associated with molecular material located behind kr  140 @xcite .",
    "the three submillimeter sources are located within the larger co envelope running roughly sw  ne , following the orientation of the 60  @xmath0 m contours .",
    "the iras scan pattern for this region places the major axis of the detectors along a sw  ne direction and so the psc fluxes are the contribution of the ensemble of sources in the area .",
    "the crowded nature of the region makes it difficult to use the iras flux densities to determine temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , kmjb 19 is well off the @xmath59 m centroid and hence relatively cold .",
    "it is detectable at 450  @xmath0 m , leading to a 450/850 @xmath0 m color temperature of 8@xmath12  k. the resulting mass ( 50 m@xmath2 ) and density ( 10@xmath60 @xmath55 ) are consistent with the object being a cold molecular core , like kmjb 8 .",
    "mass estimates were obtained for kmjb 17 and 18 using the 850  @xmath0 m flux and assuming a temperature of 20  k ( which is roughly consistent with explaining the @xmath59 m emission ) .",
    "the mass and lower limits on the density ( the sources are point sources ) are both consistent with the objects being molecular cores .",
    "kmjb 18 is probably warmer than kmjb 17 given the facts that they are of comparable brightness at 850  @xmath0 m and 18 is located closer to the centroid of the 60  @xmath0 m emission . taking this into account would accentuate the mass and density differences .",
    "this source is located to the northeast and outside of the kr  140 radio continuum emission .",
    "it seems likely that this relatively bright source is associated with molecular material at the distance of kr  140 .",
    "on the basis of the sed , this would be a class i object @xcite .",
    "we proceed with the analysis assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc and show that this consistently explains a number of observational characteristics of the source .",
    "the infrared colors of the infrared point source iras  02171 + 6058 are characteristic of an ultracompact ( uchii ) region based upon the criteria of @xcite : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "they also match the criteria of @xcite for an region : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "it should be noted that the psc 60  @xmath0 m flux is only of moderate quality ( as defined in the iras explanatory supplement 1988 ) , but it is in agreement with a flux density measurement we made from the hires images of the region .",
    "the source does not meet the additional flux criteria set by @xcite , f@xmath65 jy which was designed to help filter out reflection nebulae and extragalactic objects .",
    "the source was included in a cs ( 2 - 1 ) survey by bronfman , nyman , & may ( 1996 ) and a methanol maser survey by @xcite , but in both cases no detections were made .",
    "since this iras point source is detected at 12 , 25 , 60 , 100 and 850  @xmath0 m it is surprising that it is not seen at 450  @xmath0 m .",
    "we fit a single - temperature bluebody to the 850 , 100 and 60 @xmath0 m data points to obtain a temperature estimate of 27  k ( see figure  [ fig : sourcesed ] ) .",
    "this best fit predicts a flux density of 2.8 jy at 450  @xmath0 m which normally should be detectable , especially in the smoothed scan map .",
    "however , there is a large gradient in the 450  @xmath0 m scan map around this position due to enhanced noise at the edge of the map which may be making it hard to detect the source .",
    "the fitted sed yields a total mass of 5 m@xmath2 . using 0.23  pc as a typical length scale ,",
    "the density is found to be @xmath66 @xmath55 .",
    "note that this dust is not heated by the exciting star of kr  140 ; there must be a source internal to the cloud .",
    "the total flux derived from the best - fit sed gives a luminosity of @xmath67 l@xmath68 assuming a distance of 2.3  kpc .",
    "this can be compared to the bolometric luminosity for main sequence b5 v ",
    "b8 v stars which ranges from @xmath69 to 10@xmath70 l@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of a corresponding point source in the 1420 mhz continuum image .",
    "the sensitivity of the 1420 mhz cgps images is 0.2 mjy/@xmath8 beam @xcite .",
    "ionization equilibrium can be used to relate this brightness level to the rate at which a star is emitting ionizing photons ( q ) . at the distance of kr  140 this brightness level corresponds to log(q )",
    "= 44.0 for a point source , and so any embedded o or early b main sequence stars ( which have log(q ) @xmath71 47 ; kerton 2000 ) would certainly be detected in the cgps radio data .",
    "chini , krgel , & wargau ( 1987 ) derived a relationship between the total luminosity ( as seen reradiated by dust ) of a compact region and the gas mass : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the luminosity and gas mass in solar units .",
    "the lowest luminosity and mass considered in their study was @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "using an extrapolation of this relationship , the luminosity derived for this object above corresponds to a mass of 6@xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with the independently determined measurement of the mass based upon the submillimeter observations , and indicates that the @xcite relationship may hold to lower @xmath73 and @xmath29 values than covered in their study of regions with ionizing stars .",
    "the iras psc fluxes for this object are only of marginal use since they contain two upper limits at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m . to get more information we examined hires images of the kr  140 region . at 100  @xmath0",
    "m the source is not visible against the very strong emission coming from the nearby dust shell of the region .",
    "we were able to measure flux densities at the other three iras bands .",

    "the object does have @xmath79 and @xmath80 colors in the range expected for an uchii region as set by @xcite , although the @xmath80 color is at the lower limit .",
    "@xcite used the @xmath81 color and a higher limit to the @xmath80 color to define uchii regions , and this object does not match their criteria for an uchii region .",
    "therefore , from the iras colors alone it is unlikely that the object is an uchii region .",
    "we fit a single - temperature bluebody to the 850 , 450 and 60 @xmath0 m data points to obtain a temperature estimate of 22  k ( see figure  [ fig : sourcesed ] ) . the best - fit curve predicts a flux density of 68  jy at 100  @xmath0 m which is consistent with the upper limits reported in the psc .",
    "this value is also below the 100  @xmath0 m flux density limit set by @xcite .",
    "values from this best - fitting curve were then used to derive a total mass of 19 @xmath82 .    using the sed , and assuming a distance of 2.3  kpc , we calculated a total luminosity of 10@xmath83 @xmath84 .",
    "as with kmjb 3 there is no corresponding 1420 mhz continuum source .",

    "a least - squares fit to the data of a @xmath86 power law resulted in @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite compiled results from a number of studies and showed that a power law distribution with @xmath88 describes the clump mass distribution in molecular clouds for clumps with masses ranging from @xmath89 to several @xmath90  @xmath82 .",
    "the two studies contained within @xcite that are closest to our study with respect to the mass range covered agree within the stated uncertainties .",
    "clumps in the mass range 0.6 to 160  @xmath82 surrounding the region s  140 were found to follow an @xmath91 power law , while clumps in the mass range 0.8 to 50  @xmath82 surrounding the region ngc 1499 followed @xmath92 . in figure",
    "[ fig : motte_clump ] we have plotted the cumulative mass distribution for the larger scale cores ( 0.05 pc to 0.3 pc in size ) in @xmath93 oph using the data from @xcite .",
    "these objects also follow a power law relationship similar to what we find in kr  140 , @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , millimeter and submillimeter studies of the nearby @xmath93  oph region have shown that the mass distribution of the smaller scale fragments ( 2400 to 5000 au in size ) contained within the cores appears to mimic the stellar imf @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the ovro interferometer to study similarly sized objects in the more distant serpens molecular core .",
    "they also found a steep power law distribution consistent with the stellar imf , @xmath95 .",
    "the key similarities in these three studies are that they probed sufficiently small linear scales ( 0.01  0.02 pc ) and that a sufficient range in masses was observed to detect a steepening of the mass function above 0.5 @xmath82 .",
    "these both appear to be important requirements .",
    "of the studies listed by @xcite only the study of the nearby ( @xmath96  pc ) quiescent cloud l1457 has sufficiently high angular resolution to be comparable to the @xmath93 oph and serpens studies .",
    "however , the highest mass clump detected is only 0.2 @xmath82 and so all of the detected objects lie on a shallow part of the mass distribution function ( @xmath97 )",
    ". one can interpret this as either being consistent with the low mass portion of the stellar imf or being consistent with a global power law for molecular cloud structure .",
    "our study of kr  140 has sufficient overlap in mass coverage to probe the connection between cloud structure and the stellar imf , but the larger scale objects that we detect at our relatively low resolution follow the well - established @xmath98 power law seen for structures within giant molecular clouds and for the clouds themselves ( williams , blitz , & mckee 2000 ) .      how might the submillimeter sources relate to future star formation ?",
    "the bonnor - ebert ( be ) critical mass @xcite is given by @xmath99 using @xmath100 and the standard formula for the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath101 ) we can write @xmath102 to derive @xmath103 from our data we have assumed that @xmath104 since our co data are of too low resolution to give information about the gas dynamics or temperatures within specific clumps directly .",
    "figure  [ fig : massbe ] plots the derived submillimeter mass @xmath29 versus the corresponding @xmath103 for each clump .",
    "clumps with @xmath105 are not gravitationally bound or unstable .",
    "prominent among these are the sources that we have identified as parts of the dust shell , 7 and 15 ; their existence depends on pressure of the region and its dynamical expansion .",
    "all of the other `` stable '' sources ( 2 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 22 ) would also be pressure supported or transient .",
    "there are clumps which are detected at only one submillimeter wavelength and have no clear iras counterparts .",
    "for these we have assumed @xmath106  k. adopting a lower @xmath33 would have led to a lower @xmath103 and higher @xmath29 ( figure  [ fig : terr ] ) , moving the clumps toward the region of instability . however ,",
    "unless we adopted a substantially lower temperature ( @xmath19 7 k ) the clumps would remain in the stable region .",
    "clumps with @xmath107 are massive enough to collapse under the effect of self - gravity . excluding the clumps that have already formed stars ( kmjb 1 and 3 )",
    ", we find eleven , including the aligned sources 11 , 12 , and 14 , and 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , and 19 .",
    "this result derives from the low temperature ( @xmath108  k ) that we have measured for these sources .",
    "kmjb 17 and 18 are also barely over the instability line .",
    "for these we have assumed @xmath109  k. adopting a lower @xmath33 would move the clumps further into the region of instability .    by combining the available observational data on molecular clouds",
    ", @xcite showed that over a wide range in sizes gravitationally - bound molecular clumps follow the relationships @xmath110 and @xmath111 were @xmath112 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath113 is the largest linear dimension ( in pc ) , and @xmath29 is the mass of the object ; thus @xmath114 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the objects have a constant column density .",
    "figure  [ fig : massrad ] shows @xmath115 ( or equivalently @xmath116 ) vs.  @xmath113 .",
    "the bimodal distribution of the sources is apparent .",
    "all of the unbound sources , with @xmath105 , have a very low column density below @xmath117 . the average column density , @xmath118  @xmath39 , for all of the sources with @xmath119 ( except the outlying sources 5 and 12 ) is twice what would be deduced from @xcite .",
    "this may be due to our using a different tracer , and thus a different length and mass scale .",
    "@xcite showed that this result can be interpreted as virial equilibrium with non - thermal pressure support from turbulent gas motions .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , star formation appears to occur only in cores with @xmath120 @xmath39 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "theoretically this is expected because of the sharp decrease in the ionization fraction within such cores which in turn allows ambipolar diffusion to proceed at a faster rate @xcite . in clouds where both magnetic and turbulent support are important one still needs a low ionization fraction to allow collapse to proceed after the loss of turbulent support @xcite .",
    "the sharp decrease in the ionization fraction at @xmath121 may also be related directly to the loss of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic support because of the reduction in ion - neutral coupling @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied 40 molecular cloud cores in taurus in c@xmath122o and found that all of the cores with @xmath120 @xmath39 were associated with h@xmath123co@xmath124 emission ( which they interpret as being protostellar condensations ) and/or cold iras sources . in our sample of sources around kr  140",
    "only kmjb 1 and 3 have unambiguous evidence for star formation having occurred and both are high column density sources .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the other observed sources for evidence of star formation via higher resolution observations of dense gas tracers .",
    "kmjb 12 , lying well above the line , is an interesting object for further study because of its large mass and location on the ridge boundary discussed below . among the clumps with @xmath125 , kmjb 5",
    "has an unusually low column density .",
    "are the clumps just structure in the cloud that pre - existed the formation of ves  735 and kr  140 or is there ongoing evolution ?",
    "the three high density sources 11 , 12 , and 14 are of particular interest .",

    "they are aligned along the edge of a co cloud with v@xmath126 km s@xmath46 ( figure  [ fig : scancomp ] ) and also parallel to , but outside of , a ridge which appears in a high resolution h@xmath127 map @xcite .",
    "these sources are probably not foreground to the region since even with their large column densities they do not produce distinctive silhouettes on the h@xmath127 map .",
    "this and the striking alignment suggest that a causal relationship exists between the formation of these clumps at this location and the expansion of the kr  140 region .",
    "we have estimated that the age of the kr  140 region is about @xmath128 years @xcite , which is certainly sufficient time for a layer of gas to be swept up and become gravitationally unstable even for the low density molecular cloud associated with kr  140 .",
    "other cold submillimeter sources ( e.g. , 6 , 8 , and 19 ) lie at the the edge of the region ( see figure  [ fig : scancomp ] ) and their location is also suggestive of a link between the expansion of the region and their formation .",
    "this mix of clumps , some that appear to have formed in particular locations because of the action of other stars , some that appear to have formed spontaneously in various regions throughout a larger cloud , and some which are forming stars ( this would include the clump that formed ves  735 ) , is not unlike what is seen in other star - forming regions ( e.g. , for @xmath93  oph , see the discussion in section 6.3 of motte et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it would be expected that a cluster would be forming near ves  735 and so it is interesting to examine the stellar ( or proto - stellar ) content .",
    "our analysis has shown that there are no uchii regions in the vicinity of kr  140 and so ves 735 appears to be the only o star to have formed in the region . from @xcite the total mass of the molecular cloud associated with kr  140 is estimated to be about 5@xmath129  @xmath82 .",
    "o star formation in clouds with a cloud mass of below 10@xmath130 @xmath82 is considered rare @xcite and so it would actually have been very unusual to find yet another o star in the vicinity of ves 735 .",

    "@xcite estimate that ves 735 and kr  140 are 12 @xmath132 years old , ample time for these stars to have formed and evolved to their present state ; in fact their evolution is probably relatively delayed rather than coeval .",
    "close to kr  140 there are five bright infrared stars ( birs 128 to 132 ; elmegreen 1980 ; see figure  14 in ballantyne et al .",
    "2000 ) with very red @xmath133 colors ( 4.3 to 6.7 ; @xmath134 and @xmath29 in this paragraph refer to apparent and absolute magnitudes respectively ) .",
    "birs 128 is just outside of kmjb 7 ( see figure  [ fig : eastshell ] ) , birs 131 and 132 are near kmjb 16 , and birs 129 and 130 are seen projected against the region , north of ves  735 . however , while @xcite considers the stars as possibly `` embedded '' there is no significant submillimeter ( or infrared ) emission coincident with their positions , which puts a limit @xmath135 or @xmath136 on associated clumped dust .",
    "the general foreground extinction seen to affect ves  735 and kr  140 amounts to @xmath137 @xcite or @xmath138 .",
