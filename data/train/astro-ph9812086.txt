    "recently two groups have reported the independent discovery of new local group dwarf galaxies , potential companions of m31 .",
    "armandroff et  al.(1998a ) used a digital filtering technique to survey digitized poss - ii plates covering a 1550 deg@xmath10 area surrounding m31 and found several candidate dwarf galaxies .",
    "they demonstrated that their first candidate , andv , is a dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy sufficiently close to m31 to be its satellite .",
    "an additional candidate , named andvi following van den bergh s ( 1974 ) convention , was resolved into stars and found not to contain hii regions ( armandroff et  al .  1998b , c ) .",
    "the second group , karachentsev & karachentseva ( 1998a , b ) visually inspected film copies of poss - ii plates and detected four  potential new dwarf companions of m31 .",
    "the two  brightest , granulated detections were deemed to be the most promising candidates .",
    "these were initially named pegasusdw and cassiopeiadw after their parent constellations ( karachentsev & karachentseva 1998a , b ) , and later renamed pegdsph and casdsph by tikhonov & karachentsev 1999 ) .",
    "note , pegdsph is equivalent to andvi and was discovered independently by the two  groups .",
    "the galaxy casdsph is located in an area for which no poss - ii plate scan was available to armandroff et  al .",
    ". we will adopt the designations pegdsph and casdsph throughout this _",
    "letter_.    these three newly discovered candidate m31 dsphs , andv , pegdsph , and casdw , double the census of known m31 dsphs .",
    "it is important to test whether the m31 dsphs follow the same relations between absolute magnitude , surface brightness , metallicity , @xmath11 ratio , and galactocentric distance as the milky way dsph satellites ? do environment and distance from m31 affect their formation histories as one might expect from van den bergh s ( 1994 ) ram pressure / tidal stripping scenario ?",
    "this _ letter _ presents results from keck imaging of pegdsph and casdsph that address some of these questions ; a preliminary version of the results were presented by grebel ( 1999 ) .",
    "our keck results are also compared to the results from three  other recent / ongoing studies of a similar nature targeting these galaxies ( tikhonov & karachentsev 1999 ; hopp et  al .",
    "1999 ; armandroff et  al .  1998c , 1999 )",
    "in preparation for a stellar spectroscopy program of m31 s dsph companions , pegdsph and casdsph were imaged with the keck  ii 10-m telescope in august ",
    "september  1998 , using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) with a @xmath12 ccd and a scale of @xmath13  pixel@xmath14 .",
    "short exposures were obtained in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands : @xmath15s and @xmath16s , respectively , per galaxy . observing conditions were photometric and the seeing ranged from 0710 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the overlapping field of view of the final , combined images is @xmath17 .",
    "resolved objects ( galaxies ) and regions around bright , saturated stars are excluded from further analysis ( cf .",
    "reitzel et  al .",
    "stellar photometry is carried out with the daophot / allframe programs ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "the photometric transformation uses airmass coefficients from krisciunas et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) and observations of faint secondary standards ( stetson , priv .  comm . ) in landolt ( 1992 ) fields .",
    "pegdsph and casdsph have the appearance of typical low - surface brightness spheroidal galaxies without recognizable concentrations of bright stars , hii regions , or obvious globular clusters ( figure  1 ) .",
    "pegdsph is not detected in h@xmath18 , indicating the absence of currently star - forming regions ( armandroff 1998a ) .",
    "an ellipticity of  0.3 is estimated for both galaxies , along with position angles of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for pegdsph and casdsph , respectively .",
    "hopp et  al.s ( 1999 ) measurement of the pegdsph structural parameters is in agreement with this estimate .",
    "the ellipticities of pegdsph and casdsph are similar to those of galactic dsph satellites at larger distances from the milky way ( e.g. ,  caldwell et  al .",
    "1992 ) , suggesting little or no distortion through tidal effects .",
    "a detailed analysis of the galaxies structural parameters will be presented in a later paper ( guhathakurta & grebel 1999 ) .",
    "the cumulative stellar @xmath1-band luminosity function ( lf ) for both galaxies is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the lf of casdsph rises at @xmath21 , and this is interpreted as the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "the lf upturn is more gradual for pegdsph with @xmath22 .",
    "the galactic line - of - sight reddening is estimated from dirbe / iras maps ( schlegel et  al .",
    "1998 ) to be @xmath23 and @xmath24 , or @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for pegdsph and casdsph , respectively .",
    "an absolute magnitude of @xmath27 for the trgb ( lee at al .",
    "1993 ) implies true distance moduli of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for pegdsph and casdsph , respectively , where the errors include uncertainties in the exact location of the trgb ( poisson error , possible presence of intermediate - age stars brighter than the trgb ) , reddening , and photometric calibration .",
    "tikhonov & karachentsev ( 1999 ) find apparent distance moduli for pegdsph and casdsph that translate into true distance moduli of @xmath30 and  24.36 , respectively , when the above foreground extinction correction is applied .",
    "corrected in the same manner , hopp et  al.s ( 1999 ) finding corresponds to @xmath31 for pegdsph .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the results of this study , when the uncertainties in the measurements are taken into account .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of pegdsph and casdsph show prominent red giant branches ( rgbs ) and no evidence for young blue stars ( figure  3 ) .",
    "note , the surrounding @xmath32 `` field '' cmds in figure  3 , each drawn from a region whose area is about 45% that of the @xmath33 galaxy area .",
    "the field cmds are slightly contaminated by stars in the outskirts of the dsph galaxies ( @xmath34 of the number of stars in the corresponding @xmath33 galaxy cmd ) , but this is unimportant for the purposes of this study since no significant radial gradient appears to be present in the galaxies properties .",
    "the casdsph rgb is more densely populated than that of pegdsph , a reflection of casdsph s higher stellar surface density . a small metal - rich ( @xmath35<-1 $ ] ) population appears to be indicated by stars with @xmath36 near the trgb in casdsph ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the density and color distribution of stars above the casdsph trgb are similar to that in the corresponding `` field '' cmd , but the presence of a small intermediate - age asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) population can not be ruled out .",
    "the pegdsph cmd displays an excess of stars above the trgb relative to the field cmd ; this is also seen as a tail in the lf brighter than the trgb .",
    "these super - trgb stars may indicate the presence of a significant intermediate - age agb population in pegdsph ; they are not likely to be blend artifacts ( cf .",
    "grillmair et  al.1996 ; martnez - delgado & aparicio 1997 ) .    the mean metallicity is computed from the median reddening - corrected color , @xmath37 , at @xmath38 ( armandroff et  al .  1993 ; caldwell et  al .",
    "1998 ) , computed over the range @xmath39 . outside this color",
    "range the surface density of objects is identical for the inner @xmath33 and surrounding @xmath32 regions , indicating that the majority of these objects are foreground or background sources .",
    "for pegdsph , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , which yields @xmath6\\rangle=-1.35\\pm0.07 $ ] .",
    "for casdsph , @xmath42 for @xmath41 , which yields @xmath6\\rangle=-1.42\\pm0.04 $ ] .",
    "these errors are the formal errors of the mean ; the overall uncertainty in the mean metallicities is conservatively estimated to be @xmath43  dex due to systematic errors in photometry / calibration .",
    "these metallicity estimates are in good agreement with those derived from the standard globular cluster rgb fiducials ( da costa & armandroff 1990 ) shown in figure  3 .",
    "the observed width of the rgb in the pegdsph and casdsph cmds , @xmath44 , corresponds to a metallicity spread of roughly 1  dex . the formal uncertainty in the color measurement ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is significantly smaller than the observed spread in bright rgb color .",
    "the effect of systematic errors ( e.g. ,  crowding , flat fielding ) , however , may be as large as @xmath45 , judging from a comparative analysis of a subset of the data obtained in poorer seeing and at a different ccd orientation with respect to the primary data set .",
    "the fact that the rgb widths are similar for pegdsph and casdsph despite the substantial difference in their stellar surface density argues against the widths being caused by crowding - related photometric error . finally , the apparent flaring of the casdsph rgb near its bright tip is strongly suggestive of a spread in [ fe / h ] .",
    "measurements of the mean metallicity in three  radial bins ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) , based on a wider @xmath1-magnitude range ( @xmath49  mag ) , places a robust upper limit on any radial metallicity gradient in the galaxies .",
    "the variation in median @xmath37 color over the inner @xmath50 region is found to be @xmath51  mag corresponding to a variation in mean metallicity of @xmath52 dex , comparable to the formal error in @xmath6\\rangle$ ] quoted above .",
    "thus pegdsph and casdsph show no evidence for a radial metallicity gradient , in contrast with what is seen in some dsphs with substantial intermediate - age populations ( see grebel 1997 for a summary ) .",
    "the central surface brightness in the @xmath0 band , measured in a @xmath53-diameter aperture after subtraction of bright foreground stars and corrected for line - of - sight extinction ( same procedure as in armandroff et  al .",
    "1998a ) , is @xmath54 and 23.6  mag  arcsec@xmath55 for pegdsph and casdsph , respectively ; these brightnesses are higher than the observed @xmath56 values for the other m31 dsphs ( caldwell et  al .",
    "1992 ; armandroff et  al.1998a ) : 24.9 ( andi ) , 24.8 ( andii ) , 25.3 ( andiii ) , and 25.2  mag  arcsec@xmath55 ( andv ) .",
    "pegdsph and casdsph , along with the newly discovered andv dsph ( armandroff et  al .",
    "1998a ) , follow the general @xmath6\\rangle$]-vs-@xmath56 relationship defined by local group dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , dwarf irregulars , and dsphs ( figure  4 , _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "absolute @xmath57-band magnitudes , @xmath58 , are computed from the total apparent magnitudes , @xmath59 , estimated by karachentsev & karachentseva ( 1998a ) .",
    "pegdsph lies on the mean @xmath58-vs-@xmath56 relation defined by other local group dwarf galaxies ( figure  4 , _ lower panel _ ) , while casdsph is somewhat less luminous than other dwarfs of comparable @xmath56 .",
    "a summary of the properties of the two new dsphs pegdsph and casdsph derived from keck imaging is given in table  1 .",
    "their mean metallicities resemble that of the m31 globular cluster system ( @xmath35=-1.2$]huchra et  al.1991 ) and of the intermediate - age / old field populations in m31 s de companions , but are higher than the @xmath6\\rangle$ ] of the other four  m31 dsphs ( cf .",
    "grebel 1997 ; armandroff et  al .",
    "pegdsph and casdsph also have the highest central surface brightnesses of the known m31 dsphs .",
    "their detection may have been hampered by the presence of nearby , bright foreground stars .",
    "heliocentric distances of @xmath60  kpc for pegdsph and @xmath61 kpc for casdsph translate into distances of @xmath62  kpc and @xmath63  kpc from m31 , respectively , adopting the cepheid - based distance of @xmath64  kpc to m31 ( cf .",
    "freedman & madore 1990 ; holland 1998 ) .",
    "thus pegdsph and casdsph are the most distant of the currently known m31 dsph satellites .",
    "the leoi and leoii dsphs have comparable distances from the milky way , lending credence to karachentsev & karachentseva s ( 1998a ) suggestion that pegdsph and casdsph belong to an extended subsystem of m31 companions together with andv and lgs3 .",
    "the fraction of stars belonging to an intermediate - age population shows a bimodal distribution among the milky way dsphs , with small intermediate - age fractions at small galactocentric distances and dominant fractions at large distances ( van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "by contrast , all the m31 dsph companions appear to have small intermediate - age populations ( with the possible exception of andii  da costa 1998 ) , even though they are located at comparable distances from their more massive parent galaxy .",
    "the possibility of highly eccentric orbits in the m31/m33 system can not be ruled out .",
    "our planned spectroscopic observations will help constrain the orbits of the m31 dsphs through radial velocity measurements and should lead to more accurate metallicity and abundance spread determinations .",
