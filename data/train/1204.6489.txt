    "the idea of inflation in the very early universe  @xcite is a very compelling solution to the problems of the big bang theory .",
    "however one should keep in mind that there may be other viable alternative explanations .",
    "other successful predictions  @xcite of the simplest inflationary models are the nearly scale invariant , mostly of adiabatic origin and nearly gaussian primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "this primordial perturbation is generated due to quantum vacuum fluctuations of the scalar field driving inflation and will at a much later stage in the evolution of the universe give origin to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropies and the large - scale structure of galaxies in the universe .",
    "while the simplest models are appealing due to their simplicity and fewer ingredients they are not always realistic and often more realistic models introduce several fields , non - trivial potentials and kinetic terms , etc .. all these models have to pass the observational constraints imposed by current data on the cosmological background as well as on the power spectrum of the perturbations . in many cases",
    "the lack of other observables renders many models observationally indistinguishable .",
    "however some models have other observables like non - gaussianity ( i.e. non - linearity of the perturbations ) and these can be and are being used to further constrain and distinguish models .",
    "non - gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation has not been observed , however the cmb data still allows a small non - gaussianity ( @xmath3 ) and there have been some claims of detections or hints of its presence  @xcite . despite this small value , efforts are underway ( e.g. esa s planck satellite  @xcite ) to measure the cmb anisotropies to a precision with which this small amount would be detected to many standard deviations .",
    "it also turns out that the simplest models of inflation , i.e. the ones driven by a single scalar field with standard kinetic term , with a potential satisfying the slow - roll conditions and if one assumes the standard initial conditions for the quantum vacuum fluctuations , predict a small and unobservable level of primordial non - linearity  @xcite .",
    "therefore only models that can produce large non - gaussianity can be constrained if no detection is made .",
    "one of such models put forward by starobinsky in 1992  @xcite will be the focus of this work .",
    "many models which break at least one of the above conditions have been proposed and studied recently .",
    "an incomplete list is : for models that use several fields @xcite , for models with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite , models with temporary violations of the slow - roll conditions or small departures of the initial vacuum state from the standard bunch - davies vacuum @xcite . for reviews on the theory of non - gaussian perturbations",
    "see @xcite .    the initial motivation of the starobinsky model  @xcite that breaks temporarily the slow - roll approximation was to explain an observation that the correlation function of galaxies seemed to require more power on large scales than at smaller length scales within the paradigm of a einstein - de - sitter universe ( a spatially flat universe with cold dark matter particles ) .",
    "it was also used to explain the possible nonconservation ( enhancement ) of the curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales due to not - fast - enough decay of the decaying mode  @xcite .",
    "more recently similar models  @xcite were revived and proposed because it was realized that they can provide better fits to the cmb anisotropies power spectrum than the primordial power - law model  @xcite .",
    "another reason for this interest is that it was realized that such models have very distinctive bispectrum signatures like for instance non - linearity parameters that are strongly scale - dependent . a particularly appealing feature of the starobinsky model",
    ", a vacuum energy dominated potential added with a linear term that changes slope abruptly at a point , is that despite breaking a slow - roll condition it admits an analytical treatment of the background and linear perturbations equations as well as the non - gaussianity as was shown in  @xcite and in the present paper .",
    "the main goal of this work is to compute analytically the leading - order bispectrum for the starobinsky model .",
    "the bispectrum on large scales was first computed in @xcite using a next - to - leading order gradient expansion formulation and more recently on all scales in the equilateral limit in @xcite , we compare the results of our calculation with these works .    this paper is divided in four sections and an appendix . in section [ sec : model ] , we describe the model and the analytical solutions for the background and linear perturbations are briefly reviewed . in section [ sec : bispectrum ] , we compute the leading - order contribution to the bispectrum in the equilateral limit . in the second subsection",
    "we shall discuss and compare our results with previous attempts in the literature . in the last subsection we elaborate on the size and shape of the analogue of the non - linearity parameter in this model .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",

    "( [ bispectrumtwovertices ] ) . in the equilateral limit",
    ", we obtained that on scales larger than the scale of the transition @xmath0 the dominant contribution to the bispectrum scales as @xmath117 , that is , the analogue of the non - linearity parameter , @xmath149 , scales as @xmath150 .",
    "this is in agreement with the leading - order result of  @xcite ( after correcting its factor two error ) but it differ from the large scale result of  @xcite .",
    "this last result was found to scale as @xmath151 .",
    "we explained the origin of this difference with the fact that ref .",
    "@xcite missed the contribution coming from a term in the cubic - order action that contains the dirac delta function in the time derivative of the coupling constant , @xmath152 .",
    "this missing contribution has the opposite sign to the dominant term they calculated and it partially cancels it out and one is left with the result we found , that is @xmath153 . for small scales , we found some interesting behaviour .",
    "the parameter @xmath149 scales as @xmath154 .",
    "the  angular frequency \" of the small scale oscillations is set by the transition scale and is given by @xmath2 .",
    "the envelope function of these oscillations in a linear growth toward small scales .",
    "a similar result was found in  @xcite for a somehow related model .",
    "this linear growth represents a strong scale dependence of the non - linearity parameter in this model and the @xmath155 enhancement factor can have important consequences regarding observations .",
    "it would be interesting to consider observational constraints on this kind of oscillating and growing amplitude @xmath149 models , however that study is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "once again this result differs from the result found in ref .",
    "there , it was found that @xmath149 scales as @xmath156 , with no enhancement factor .",
    "the reason for the difference with respect to our result is again the fact that the contribution from the dirac delta function was missed .",
    "finally , we briefly showed that the amplitude of @xmath149 can reach values much larger than one on small scales .",
    "the large enhancement factor @xmath155 is key in reaching that conclusion .    for future work",
    ", we leave the computation of the trispectrum or four - point function .",

    "( [ generalbeforetransition ] ) and it is sub - leading with respect to the contribution after the transition .",
    "therefore for the scales of interest the bispectrum is well approximated by the contribution after the transition only .",
