    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) show that the universe is isotropic on large scales to very good precision .",
    "indeed , the cmb radiation is an almost perfect black body  @xcite with a temperature of @xmath0  @xcite , and tiny temperature fluctuations superimposed with an amplitude of the order @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the exception is the dipole , which is at the level of @xmath2 , and can be explained by our motion with respect to the cmb rest frame .",
    "the assumption that measurements at any position in the universe would lead to the same result implies that the universe is also homogeneous .",
    "observations of large scale structure support this assumption  @xcite .",
    "this einstein s cosmological principle is a corner stone of modern cosmology and , hence , it is important to further experimentally test its validity .",
    "there has been much interest recently in the possibility that small violations of homogeneity and/or isotropy could give rise to the observed cmb anomalies .",
    "some of the often quoted cmb anomalies are  @xcite : an anomalously small quadrupole and octupole moments ; a large deviation from the mean in some of the higher multipoles ; the north - south asymmetry , the peculiar alignment of the quadrupole and octupole and their pointing in the direction of virgo  @xcite ; the alignment of some of the higher multipoles  @xcite ; the curious lack of power in the temperature angular correlation function on large angular scales  @xcite , _ etc . _ different authors disagree however in what constitutes significant deviation from homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "for example , bennett et al .",
    "@xcite tend to tune down the statistical significance of these anomalies , and argue that most of them can be attributed to priors .",
    "they also argue that , in the absence of a deep theoretical justification , which would make further tests possible , these anomalies will most likely remain curiosities .",
    "in addition to the cmb anomalies , there are also anomalies in the large scale structure of the universe . for example , observational evidence was reported by kashlinsky and collaborators  @xcite for large scale ( dark ) flows of galactic clusters which can not be explained by homogeneous , adiabatic , gaussian , cosmological perturbations generated during inflation .",
    "moreover , some authors  @xcite offer an alternative to dark energy by considering the earth to be located near the center of a large void  @xcite , or by considering a randomly distributed collection of voids in the universe ( the swiss cheese universe )  @xcite .",
    "the question we pose in this paper is whether some of these anomalies can be explained by placing a small black hole into an inflationary universe .",
    "since answering this question rigorously is hard , here we make a first step in addressing it . in order to model cosmological perturbations",
    "we consider quantum fluctuations of a massless ( or light ) scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) space , and calculate the corresponding spectrum .",
    "based on the knowledge of the mukhanov - sasaki gauge invariant potential , we then estimate the spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations .",
    "we make the assumption that the gauge invariant treatment also applies to the inhomogeneous cosmology at hand , but warn the reader that our approach should be tested by a rigorous study of cosmological perturbations in inhomogeneous settings such as inflation endowed with a small black hole . in this paper",
    "we ignore tensor perturbations , since we expect that their amplitude will be , just as in homogeneous cosmologies , suppressed when compared to that of scalar perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the effect of vector modes is not taken into account because they are not dynamical for a homogeneous background and hence we expect them to play a subdominant role in the case of weak breaking of homogeneity that we consider .",
    "it is an important question how to relate our results for the primordial spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations to the cmb observables .",
    "an interesting study in this direction is ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors investigate how different types of violation of homogeneity and isotropy would affect the temperature fluctuations in the cmb . based on symmetry considerations ,",
    "the authors consider in particular how a point - like defect ( particle ) , a line - like defect ( cosmic string ) or a plane - like defect ( domain wall ) would modify the observed temperature anisotropies . by symmetry",
    "a small black hole is closest to a point - like object , yet its event horizon makes it a more complex object to study .   while the analysis in  @xcite is useful to make a connection between cosmological perturbations generated in inflation and temperature fluctuations , it is not general enough to suit our needs . in particular , it can not be used for a primordial black hole whose comoving distance from us is small in comparison to the wavelength of the perturbation considered .",
    "the main theoretical motivation for studying spectral inhomogeneities generated by a stationary black hole in inflation is that they yield results that can be tested against observations .",
    "this is so because the resulting spectrum can be viewed as a six parameter _",
    "template_. a good analogue are the gravitational wave templates provided by black hole binary systems . to illustrate more precisely what we mean , recall that homogeneous inflation produces a ( power law ) spectrum which , as a function of spatial momentum @xmath3 , can be viewed as a two - parameter template , the parameters being the spectral amplitude ( @xmath4 ) and its slope ( @xmath5 ) , which have been by now tightly constrained by cmb measurements  @xcite . when viewed as a template , the sds spectrum contains four additional parameters .",
    "these constitute the black hole position @xmath6 with respect to us and its mass @xmath7 during inflation  , which we parametrize by @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the de  sitter hubble parameter , and @xmath10 is newton s constant .   in the light of the upcoming cmb observatories , such as the planck satellite , and ever increasing large scale galactic redshift surveys , it is clear that we will be able to test the inflationary black hole hypothesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the inhomogeneous schwarzschild - de  sitter background metric and the corresponding scalar field equation of motion .",
    "we make a simple estimate of the number of black holes per hubble volume at the beginning of inflation in section 3 .",
    "then , in section 4 we derive a formula which relates the amplitude of inflaton fluctuations on schwarzschild - de  sitter space to the spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations .",
    "the schwinger - keldysh propagator is derived in section  5 by expanding in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "section 6 deals with the application to cosmology .",
    "in particular , we obtain the power spectrum and illustrate its features in various plots in section  7 .",
    "we close our paper in section  8 with a discussion .",
    "various technical details are relegated to four appendices . in this paper",
    "we work in units where @xmath12 , but we keep newton s constant @xmath13 , the reduced planck mass , @xmath14 and the planck mass @xmath15 .",
    "a primordial black hole breaks the translational invariance of the background but does preserve rotational symmetry .",
    "the space - time metric of a black hole in an asymptotically homogeneous universe is the schwarzschild - de  sitter ( sds ) solution , giving rise to a line element which is usually written in static coordinates as @xmath16 with @xmath17 . in these",
    "coordinates the three symmetries of the sds space are manifest : the time translation invariance and the two spatial rotations .",
    "quantum fluctuations of a scalar field on the schwarzschild background have been dealt with in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that the radial mode functions of a massless scalar field can be expressed in terms of heun s functions .",
    "but the presence of a cosmological horizon complicates the analysis and the sds case has only been discussed for an extremal black hole  @xcite .",
