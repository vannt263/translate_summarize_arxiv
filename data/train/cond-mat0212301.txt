    "most if not all textbooks on thermodynamics and statistical physics define temperature as being a quantity which , contrary to other thermodynamic observables like energy or pressure , does not admit fluctuations . because of that , it is somewhat surprising to see papers with the expression ` temperature fluctuations ' in their titles appearing from time to time in serious scientific journals on subjects as various as particle physics and fluid dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , how can the temperature of a system , however small , fluctuate if one defines it ` as equal to the temperature of a very large heat reservoir with which the system is in equilibrium and in thermal contact ' @xcite ? also ,",
    "in the case of the reservoir , how can temperature be a fluctuating parameter if its definition requires one to assume the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , to assume that the system acting as a reservoir is composed of an infinite number of particles or degrees of freedom ? presumably , the thermodynamic limit should rule out any fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities like the mean energy or the pressure , so that if temperature is related to these quantities , how can it fluctuate ?",
    "the solution to this conundrum is quite simple .",
    "first , the standard definition of temperature found in textbooks is too restrictive : there is not _",
    "one _ but _ many _ definitions of temperature and of quantities analogous to temperature , as well as many physical ( non - equilibrium ) situations in the context of which these different definitions admit fluctuations @xcite .",
    "second , the standard definition of temperature involving the thermodynamic limit is only an idealization , a `` purist '' definition .",
    "real physical bodies are always composed of a finite number of particles or degrees of freedom , which means that the concept of temperature must be applicable outside the idealized realm in which it is defined if experimentalists are indeed able to measure the temperature of real bodies in real laboratories . physically , this means also that there must be a threshold number of particles or degrees of freedom ( more or less precisely defined ) above which a system can be measured or `` felt '' to have a temperature @xcite .",
    "well above this number , temperature is assured to be defined and likely to be constant , while close to this number it may be well - defined , but may change in time or vary in space ; that is , it may fluctuate !",
    "all the studies concerned with temperature fluctuations exploit one of the above ` indents ' to the standard definition of temperature .",
    "that is , they either consider alternatives to the standard definition of temperature which do admit fluctuations or apply the ` thermodynamic - limit ' definition of temperature in situations where the thermodynamic limit is assumed to be `` effectively '' reached without being reached `` formally '' , so to speak .",
    "our aim in this paper is to review a number of the these alternative definitions and situations , and to dispel , in doing so , some of the misunderstanding and misconceptions surrounding the notion of temperature fluctuations",
    ". we will be particularly interested in giving a detailed calculation of temperature fluctuations present in a system which is commonly thought to be at constant temperature , namely a system composed of a finite number of independent particles ( basically a finite volume of perfect gas ) thermally coupled to an infinite - size heat reservoir at constant temperature . in the following",
    ", we will show that if instead of defining the temperature of the particle system simply as being equal to the temperature of the reservoir we apply the statistical definition of temperature to the finite - size system of particles ( provided that the number of particles is sufficiently large ) , then we must come to the conclusion that the system s temperature is fluctuating , just as its internal energy is fluctuating because of the thermal coupling with the heat reservoir .",
    "the temperature of the particle system , in this case , is precisely related to its internal energy , and can be seen as a ` microcanonical temperature ' associated with the microscopic configurations of a system whose internal energy is held fixed during a period of time shorter than the energy fluctuations time scale .",
    "our motivation for studying the temperature fluctuations of a system of particles in a canonical ensemble setting , and for presenting moreover this study in a book about non - extensive statistical mechanics is threefold .",
    "first , a system composed of a bunch of independent particles coupled to a heat bath is one of the few thermodynamic systems for which the probability density describing the temperature fluctuations can be calculated directly using ` first - principle ' or ` microscopic ' arguments .",
    "second , for this specific system , the probability density of the temperature happens to be very similar to a class of @xmath2 densities of temperature fluctuations recently introduced by wilk and wodarczyk @xcite , as well as by beck @xcite , in the context of non - extensive statistical mechanics @xcite . finally , the models of non - extensive behavior proposed by these authors are all based on the idea of ` mixed equilibrium states , ' i.e. , near - equilibrium states of systems characterized by fluctuating temperatures . in the context of the present study , this idea , as we will see ,",
    "arises very naturally .",
    "one can imagine many different systems exhibiting temperature fluctuations .",
    "the common characteristic of all of these systems is that they are non - equilibrium systems .",
    "below , we list and briefly comment four systems or , more precisely , four generic situations for which temperature can be defined and be thought to fluctuate .",
    "the list is far from being exhaustive : the first three situations are presented to give an idea of the physical phenomena involving temperature fluctuations which have been discussed from the point of view of non - extensive statistical mechanics recently .",
    "the fourth and last case of the list , the particles and heat bath system , is the focus of this paper ( see section [ section3 ] ) .",
    "* * * temperature fluctuations in a gas .  * * a system with fluctuations of temperature ` spread ' over space can be constructed simply in the following way .",
    "take a vessel of gas , and divide it in some number of compartments thermally insulated from one another .",
    "bring the content of each compartment at different temperatures , and then remove the insulating partition . from the moment where the partition is removed , a process of temperature relaxation will take place , whereby the particles forming the gas will collide and exchange energy until a state of uniform temperature is achieved .",
    "+ the details of the relaxation process are quite complicated at the microscopic level , and depend on the nature and properties of the gas considered .",
    "but , at the macroscopic level , the net result of this experiment is simply described : between the time where the partition is removed and the time where the gas temperature is completely uniform , the temperature field of the gas will vary in space as well as in time .",
    "thus , as a whole , the vessel of gas can be said to be in a state of fluctuating temperature .",
    "this is admittedly an expletive way to say that the temperature is not homogeneous in space , but the expression is nonetheless correct and widely used ( e.g. , when referring to the spatial temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation ) .",
    "+ experimentally , there are various ways by which one can reconstruct the temperature field of the gas , apart from plunging a thermometer into it at different places .",
    "a simple method ( conceptually , not experimentally ) consists in measuring the momenta ( along a fixed direction ) of many particles of the gas at one point in space or , equivalently , sample the momentum of a single particle over some period of time , and construct from the measurements a histogram of the number of particles @xmath3 having a momentum  value between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "( @xmath6 is the coarse - graining scale at which two particles are considered to have different momentum values . )",
    "if the sample of measurements is large enough , then it is expected that the form of @xmath3 should approximately be gaussian , as predicted by maxwell and boltzmann , with a variance proportional to the temperature @xmath7 .",
    "hence , fitting @xmath3 with a gibbs distribution proportional to @xmath8 or calculating its variance or its half - width all constitute operational procedures for probing the temperature @xmath9 of the gas .",
    "it should be noted that the accuracy of any of these methods for obtaining @xmath10 depends on ( i ) the number of measurements used to construct @xmath3 , which should be large , but not necessarily infinite ! ; and ( ii ) the assumption that the gas is non - interacting ( perfect ) or weakly interacting .",
    "these two points are necessary to assume that the momenta of the particles are gaussian distributed @xcite . *",
    "* velocity temperature in turbulent fluids .",
    "* it is common in turbulent flow experiments to define an analog of temperature by looking at the distribution @xmath3 of particle velocity differences in a restricted region of a fluid using anemometry or interferometry equipments @xcite . just as in the case of the gas",
    ", temperature is defined for a fluid by fitting @xmath3 with a gibbs distribution of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the one - particle energy function taken to be a quadratic or a nearly quadratic function of the velocity variable .",
    "this defines a local inverse temperature @xmath10 which , it is important to note , does not represent the physical inverse temperature of the fluid . rather , it is a correlate of the local rate of energy dissipation that takes place at the microscopic level over a time scale known as the kolmogorov time @xcite .",
    "+ the gibbsian character of @xmath3 and the fluctuations of the velocity temperature in space , related to the spatial fluctuations of the local energy dissipation rate , have been observed in many experiments of weakly turbulent fluids ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "for fluids at high reynolds number , i.e. , highly turbulent fluids , a totally different behavior of @xmath3 is observed .",
    "indeed , recent experiments have demonstrated that @xmath3 in strong turbulence regimes is not gibbsian ; instead , it takes the form of a power - law which appears to be well - fitted by a so - called @xmath0-exponential function @xmath13^{1/(1-q)},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a fitting parameter analogous to temperature @xcite . to account for this non - gibbsian behavior ,",
    "beck has suggested to interpret @xmath0-exponential distributions as ` mixed ' distributions arising from an ensemble of exponential distributions @xmath15 parameterized by a fluctuating inverse temperature @xmath10 @xcite . that is to say , if one assumes that what is probed in those experiments is not _",
    "one _ velocity distribution @xmath3 characterized by a fixed temperature , but a _ continuum _ of distributions @xmath3 having different temperatures , then what should be observed physically is an _ average _ gibbs distribution , the average being performed over the temperature fluctuations . in this context , the essential point made by beck ( see @xcite for the details ) is that , if the probability density @xmath16 ruling the temperature fluctuations has the following form : @xmath17 ^{\\frac 1{q-1}}\\beta ^{\\frac 1{q-1}-1}\\exp \\left [ -\\frac \\beta { ( q-1)\\beta _ 0}\\right ] ,   \\label{fb2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the mixed distribution obtained by averaging the gibbs kernel @xmath20 with @xmath16 is @xmath0 -exponential .",
    "indeed , one can readily verify that @xmath21 using the above variant of the @xmath2 or gamma density @xcite for @xmath16 .",
    "this integral representation of the @xmath0-exponential function is sometimes referred to as hilhorst s formula @xcite .",
    "* * nuclear collision temperature .",
    "* the basic idea involved in the definition of temperature in nuclear scattering experiments is to consider the set of particles produced during a collision ( called the products ) as forming a gas of particles which , at a first level of approximation , can be treated as being non - interacting ( perfect gas approximation ) . from this point of view , a concept of ` collision temperature ' is defined essentially in the same way that temperature was defined for turbulent fluids except that the precise physical property to look at in scattering experiments is not the shape of the momenta distribution itself , but the so - called exponential dependence of the distribution of secondaries with respect to transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "+ since the number of particles probed during one scattering experiment is never very large ( @xmath22 ) , one must sometimes collect the momenta of particles over many scattering experiments before the exponential shape of the secondaries distribution reveals itself .",
    "however , this is not always the case :  in heavy - ion experiments at very high energy , for example , it is often observed that a single event , i.e. , only one scattering experiment is sufficient for a thermostatistical analysis to be effective @xcite .",
    "also , what is often seen is that scattering events of same nature repeated over time yield different collision temperatures , making obvious that temperature is a fluctuating parameter .",
    "+ observations of ` non - extensive ' behavior in relation to this thermodynamic picture of scattering experiments have been reported so far on two different fronts .",
    "the first is related to the distribution of secondaries , and , more precisely , to observed deviations of this distribution from its expected exponential form . due to the limited space available here",
    ", we will not discuss this case as it is quite involved .",
    "let us only mention that wilk and wodarczyk have advanced in @xcite a ` mixed exponential distribution ' model of these deviations analogous to the one suggested by beck .",
    "+ the second case of ` non - extensive ' behavior concerns the absorption of cosmic ray particles in lead chambers @xcite .",
    "this case was also studied by wilk and wodarczyk who suggested for its explanation yet another variant of the @xmath2 temperature fluctuations model ( actually before beck applied similar ideas to the study of turbulent fluids ) .",
    "the physics explained by their model is the following .",
    "the number @xmath23 of hadronic particles absorbed in lead chambers is usually measured to be distributed as a function of the depth @xmath24 according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean free path parameter or mean penetration depth ( an analog of temperature ) .",
    "this exponential distribution is , at least , what is observed at small penetration depths ( @xmath27 cm of lead ) ; beyond that , what is observed is that @xmath28 changes to a power - law which can be fitted by a @xmath0-exponential with @xmath29 . to account for this crossover , wilk _ et al .",
    "_  simply conjectured that the @xmath26 parameter characterizing the long flying components ( i.e. , the deep penetration events ) is subject to fluctuations , and , thus , that the @xmath0-exponential penetration profiles observed experimentally for these components are mixtures of exponential distributions . by assuming that the probability density of @xmath26 is a @xmath2 density , they were effectively able to reproduce the non - exponential distributions measured in laboratories @xcite .",
    "* * system coupled to a heat bath . *",
    "our last example in the panorama of thermodynamic systems characterized by temperature fluctuations is the prototypical system defining the canonical ensemble : that is , a small system @xmath30 in thermal contact with a larger system @xmath31 acting as a heat reservoir . following the standard textbook definition of the canonical ensemble , one should say that the temperature of system @xmath30 at equilibrium is constant , and is equal to the temperature of system @xmath31 ; after all , this is how thermal equilibrium is defined . however , such a statement does not do justice to one important property of @xmath30 which is that the energy density of @xmath30 fluctuates ( because of its finiteness ) while the energy density of @xmath31 does not ( by definition of a heat bath ) . + to make this statement more precise ,",
    "suppose that @xmath30 consists of @xmath32 independent particles whose energy density or mean total energy is given by @xmath33 since the particles are coupled to @xmath31 , the @xmath34 s above are random variables , which means that @xmath35 is also a random variable .",
    "moreover , observe that @xmath35 , for any finite @xmath32 , has a non - negligible probability to assume many different values because , in this case , the probability density @xmath36 of @xmath35 is not a dirac - delta function .",
    "the dirac density , formally , is only a limiting density which `` attracts '' @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "( this basically follows from the law of large numbers . ) thus , if we can associate an inverse temperature @xmath39 to all energy states such that @xmath40 , e.g. , by applying the equipartition theorem or by fitting a distribution of energy levels with a gibbs distribution as described earlier , then we must conclude that there are different values of @xmath10 effectively realized ` in ' or ` by ' the particle system , so to speak .",
    "that is to say , the probability density @xmath41 for @xmath10 , obtained from @xmath36 by a change of variables @xmath42 , can not be a dirac - delta function if @xmath43 is not itself a delta function .",
    "it is to be expected that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the inverse temperature of heat bath , only in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath38 .",
    "these points are discussed in more mathematical details in the next sections .",
    "our analysis of energy and temperature fluctuations of a system coupled to a heat bath will be presented in the context of the following model .",
    "let a vessel of gas containing @xmath32 independent ( classical ) particles be thermally coupled to a heat reservoir characterized by a fixed inverse temperature @xmath45 .",
    "the state of each particle is represented by a random variable @xmath46 , @xmath47 , to which is associated a ( one - particle ) energy @xmath48 . the set of outcomes of each of the @xmath49 s ( the one - particle state space )  is denoted by @xmath50 . with these notations , the energy density or mean energy of the gas is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the joint state of the system , i.e. , the state of the system as a whole . note that in the above expression we have defined @xmath53 as the relative number of particles which are in state @xmath4 , i.e. , as @xmath54 it should be noted that the vector @xmath55 is nothing but the histogram of one - particle states referred to as previously when we discussed temperature fluctuations .",
    "indeed , in the case where @xmath4 represents a momentum variable , the quantity @xmath56 precisely counts the number of particles having a momentum value equal to @xmath4 .",
    "( we assume throughout that the @xmath49 s are discrete random variables ; the continuous case can be treated with minor modifications . )    now , owing to the fact that the gas is treated in the canonical ensemble , in the sense that it is coupled to a heat bath , we have @xmath57 as the joint probability distribution over the states @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the @xmath32-particle partition function .",
    "of course , since all the particles are assumed to be independent ( perfect gas assumption ) , as well as all individually coupled to the same heat bath , we can also write @xmath60 with @xmath61 ( one - particle partition function ) .",
    "these equations make obvious the fact that what we are dealing with is a system of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables .",
    "the first quantity that we are interested to calculate at this point is the probability distribution or probability density @xmath43 associated with the outcomes @xmath62 . _",
    "a priori _ , finding an exact expression for @xmath43 is not an easy task , even though @xmath35 is the simplest sum of random variables that one can imagine , i.e. , one involving iid random variables .",
    "fortunately , there exists a general method by which one can obtain a very accurate approximation of @xmath43 for @xmath63 without too much efforts .",
    "this method is based on the theory of large deviations @xcite , and proceeds by observing that probability densities of normalized sums of iid random variables , such as the one defining @xmath35 , satisfy two basic properties : ( i ) they decay exponentially with the number @xmath32 of random variables involved ; and ( ii ) the rate of decay is a function of the value ( outcome ) of the sum alone . in the present context , this means specifically that @xmath43 has the form @xmath64 the sign ` @xmath65 ' above is there to emphasize that the large deviation approximation of the density @xmath43 is ` exponentially tight ' with @xmath32 , i.e. , that it is exact up to @xmath66 marginal corrections to the rate of decay @xmath67 .",
    "this rate of decay or _ rate function _ is itself calculated as the legendre transform of the quantity @xmath68=\\ln",

    "physicists who are not familiar with the formalism of large deviations will probably look at the above formulae for calculating @xmath43 as being quite formal if not fancy ( in a pejorative way ) . for them",
    ", we offer the following alternative derivation of @xmath43 .",
    "consider the density @xmath73 of states @xmath58 having the same energy @xmath74 .",
    "following the thermostatistics of gibbs and boltzmann , this density of states must be an exponential function of @xmath32 taking the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the entropy of the system at energy density @xmath77 .",
    "as is well - known , the function @xmath76 is also obtained by a legendre transform , this time involving the logarithm of the one - particle partition function or free energy .",
    "now , using the above approximation for @xmath73 , and the fact that all states @xmath58 such that @xmath74 have the same probability @xmath78 we can write @xmath79}.\\ ] ] thus , we arrive at @xmath80 one can verify that the above expression for the rate function is totally equivalent to the one found in the context of large deviation theory .",
    "both expressions are , in fact , related by the transformation @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the usual thermostatistical definition of the inverse temperature .",
    "the proof of this equivalence result follows , essentially , by noting that @xmath83 and by using the familiar expression @xmath84 for the entropy .",
    "( the complete verification of the result is left as an exercise to the reader . )",
    "let us now turn to the matter of defining an inverse temperature @xmath10 for our system of iid particles , and to the complement matter of inferring the probability density @xmath41 .",
    "following our discussion of temperature fluctuations , it should be expected that there are many ways by which one can assign a temperature to the microcanonical set of states defined by @xmath85 also , it is to be expected that one definition of temperature may not necessarily coincide with another in the case of finite - size ( @xmath86 ) systems .",
    "we illustrate this possibility by comparing below four different definitions or ` flavors ' of temperature .    *",
    "* derivative of entropy or free energy .",
    "* an obvious way to associate a temperature to the states in @xmath87 is to take the energy derivative of the microcanonical entropy @xmath76 as in eq.([b1 ] ) .",

    "will be denoted by @xmath90 to emphasize that it is based on _ intensive _ thermodynamic potentials which do not depend on @xmath32 . *",
    "* derivative of the density of state . * a slightly different definition of inverse temperature is obtained by taking the ` logarithmic derivative ' of @xmath73 with respect to the total energy @xmath91 @xmath92 _ in lieu _ of the derivative of the entropy exponent as in eq.([b1 ] ) .",
    "this defines another inverse temperature @xmath93 which differs from @xmath90 by a term of order @xmath66 which vanishes as @xmath38 . *",
    "* gibbsian distribution of states . * an inverse temperature @xmath94 can be defined from a phenomenological point of view by fitting a given distribution of states @xmath53 of mean energy @xmath62 with a gibbs distribution of the form @xmath95 we have described this definition of temperature earlier ( see section [ section2 ] ) , and have noted that it is accurate when @xmath32 is large . to be more precise ,",

    "as this holds for any @xmath87 , this implies that any measured distribution related to some randomly chosen state @xmath58 with @xmath63 ought to be a gibbs distribution or be very close to a gibbs distribution with a probability nearly equal to 1 .",
    "the preceding paragraphs show that there is some arbitrariness in defining the concept of temperature for systems composed of a finite number of particles or degrees of freedom . in theory",
    ", there is some indeed ; however , if @xmath32 is large , then defining the temperature in any of the ways described above should have little effect on the actual value of the temperature inferred .",
    "thus , for all practical purposes , we can assume that @xmath109 for @xmath63 .",
    "in view of what was said in section [ section2 ] , it should be noted that the particular approximation @xmath110 is of deep consequences : if we look at the distributions @xmath53 associated to the states @xmath111 , then we are likely to realize that the majority of these distributions , i.e. , those which have the most probability to be observed , form a set of gibbs distributions @xmath98 parameterized by a fluctuating inverse temperature @xmath39 ( from now on we do not distinguish between the different flavors of inverse temperature ) .",
    "this means that for @xmath112 all the statistical and thermodynamic properties of our system can be described , in an effective manner , using an ensemble of gibbs distributions with a fluctuating temperature .",
    "the probability density @xmath41 ruling the inverse temperature fluctuations must , in this case , be given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the inverse function of @xmath39 . using this density ,",

    "equivalently , the average can be taken over the energy coordinate : @xmath116 in the above equation , be sure to distinguish the energy function @xmath12 from the value @xmath77 of the mean energy @xmath35 .",

    "the plots are presented again for @xmath137 and @xmath148 .",
    "a rapid inspection of the expressions of @xmath149 and @xmath150 reveals that these densities are not at all the same .",
    "the density @xmath150 can in fact be viewed as emerging from the sum of the squares of @xmath32 gaussian random variables , whereas , in our case , the sum of squared gaussian random variables arises as the mean energy , and so as @xmath151 modulo some constant .",
    "this explains why performing the change of variables @xmath152 in @xmath153 yields @xmath150 modulo some constant and a jacobian term arising from the change of variables . in spite of this important difference , the second plot of fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] shows that both densities are remarkably similar as @xmath32 gets large .",
    "this , at first , does not seem surprising as both densities converge to the delta density @xmath154 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath38 . however , it is to be noted that each of them gives totally different mixed distributions when they are used in eq.([mix1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it can be shown @xcite that the mixed distribution associated with @xmath149 has the asymptotic form @xmath155 for @xmath156 , instead of @xmath157 where @xmath158 .",
    "both of these results should be compared with the ( pure ) gibbsian distribution @xmath159 which is the limiting distribution of @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the above scaling relationships clearly indicate that choosing between @xmath162 or @xmath163 has a dramatic consequence on the functional form of the mixed distribution calculated even for @xmath63 .",
    "does that imply that our model of temperature fluctuations can not serve as a model of the non - gibbsian distributions which have been observed in turbulent fluid experiments as well as in nuclear scattering experiments ?",
    "the answer is not as straightforward as one would think .",
    "first , it is not at all clear that turbulent fluids can actually be treated in the canonical ensemble and/or that the perfect gas assumption is a valid approximation in this case .",
    "these points call for further justifications .",
    "second , the extreme events @xmath164 needed to validate either one of two temperature densities compared in this work are often very difficult to detect experimentally in a reliable way .",
    "surely , additional calculations and experimental data would be welcome in order to test the validity of our approach , and to confront it with that of the authors mentioned in the present study .",
    "this seems to be especially true for nuclear scattering experiments which are usually thought to fit perfectly well into the canonical ensemble picture @xcite .",
    "our treatment of the energy and temperature fluctuations of a system coupled to a heat bath has focused mainly on the perfect gas .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the large deviation approach presented in this paper for calculating the energy and temperature probability densities in the canonical ensemble is very general .",
    "it can be applied independently of the form of the energy function @xmath12 which defines the mean energy @xmath35 , and can also be generalized without too much difficulties to cases involving other forms of probability distribution for @xmath165 ( e.g. , @xmath0 -exponential distributions ) . in this context ,",
    "an obvious extension of our work could be to consider different forms for @xmath12 , and to look at the mixed distributions which result from the corresponding temperature fluctuations .",
    "this line of thought has been followed recently by beck and cohen @xcite who derived a number of ` superstatistical ' mixed distributions ( sometimes unphysical ones ) by assuming different forms of temperature fluctuations .",
    "another problem could be to solve the following ` inverse problem ' : for which @xmath12 is @xmath41 the same @xmath2 density as the one suggested by beck ? finally , note that a large deviation calculation of @xmath43 and @xmath41 can also be carried out for systems involving dependent random variables .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations leading to the specific forms of @xmath43 and @xmath41 in this case are likely to be tedious .",
    "also , the concept of mixed distribution does not generalize easily to the case of interacting particles because the eqs.([sanov1 ] ) and ( [ sanov2 ] ) which were used to prove that gibbs distributions are the only distributions likely to be observed in large systems are valid for sequences of iid  random variables only .",
    "it is , in fact , a long - standing open problem of large deviation theory to generalize these equations to sequences of dependent random variables .",
    "solving this problem would have direct consequences in statistical physics , for it implies _ ipso facto _ a generalization of the maximum entropy principle to systems of interacting particles .",
    "it is a pleasure for me to thank m. gell - mann and c. tsallis for the kind invitation to participate to the workshop on interdisciplinary applications of nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
