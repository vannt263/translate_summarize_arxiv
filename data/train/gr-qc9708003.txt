    "large scale laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves , namely , the ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite and the medium scale detectors , geo and tama are expected to be operational by the turn of this century .",
    "compact coalescing binary systems of blackholes and/or neutron stars are relatively ` clean ' systems to model during their inspiral and their inspiral waveform can be predicted with a fair degree of reliability .",
    "this makes them the most promising sources for broad band detectors , and in particular , the upcoming interferometric detectors cited above .",
    "binary systems are also valuable sources of astrophysical information as one can probe the universe up to cosmological distances .",
    "for instance , statistical analysis of several binary coalescences enables the estimation of the hubble constant to an accuracy better than 10% @xcite .",
    "events that produce high signal - to - noise ratio can be potentially used to observe such non - linear effects , as gravitational wave tails , and to put general relativity into test in the strongly non - linear regime @xcite . due to the weak coupling of gravitational radiation with matter",
    "the signal waveform has a very low amplitude and will not stand above the detector noise .",
    "in addition to the on - going efforts to reduce the noise , and hence increase the sensitivity of the detector , a considerable amount of research activity has gone into the development of efficient and robust data analysis techniques to extract signals buried in very noisy data . for a review on gravitational waves from compact objects and their detection see thorne @xcite .",
    "various data analysis schemes have been proposed for the detection of the ` chirp ' waveform from such systems . among them",
    "the technique of matched filtering is the most promising @xcite .",
    "briefly , this technique involves correlating the detector output with a set of templates , each of which is tuned to detect the signal with a particular set of parameters . in order to obtain a high value for the correlation",
    "the signal waveform should be known to a high level of accuracy .",
    "the matched filtering technique is very sensitive to the _ phase _ of the signal and even if the template and the signal mismatch by even half a cycle the correlation integral is drastically reduced .",
    "the fully general relativistic waveform from a coalescing binary system of stars is as yet unavailable . in the absence of such an exact solution",
    ", there have been efforts to find solutions perturbatively .",
    "most of the work in this area strives towards computing the waveform correct to a high degree of accuracy so that the theoretical templates based on this will obtain the maximum possible snr .",
    "the signal is said to be detected , if the maximum value of the correlation over all the parameters of the signal crosses a preassigned threshold which has been set by the false alarm one is prepared to tolerate .",
    "once the signal is detected , the maximum likelihood estimates ( mle ) of the parameters of the binary are those of the template with which the maximum correlation is obtained .",
    "the errors involved in such an estimation have been worked out by several authors @xcite , for the case of ` high ' snr and for the newtonian and post - newtonian waveforms using a single and a network of detectors . in @xcite",
    "exhaustive monte carlo numerical simulations were carried out to compute the errors in the estimation of parameters and covariances among them , for the case of the initial ligo configuration taking into account only the first post - newtonian corrections and assuming circular orbits .",
    "it was found that the errors as obtained from the simulations were larger by a factor of two or more from the errors as computed via the covariance matrix at astrophysically relevant snrs .",
    "the discrepancy disappears as the snr increases beyond certain value - typically 15 in the newtonian case and 25 in the post - newtonian case .",
    "the comparision with other less stringent lower bounds has also not resolved the discrepancy .",
    "nicholson and vecchio @xcite have recently computed bayesian bounds such as the weiss - wainstein and ziv - zakai , for the case of newtonian signals .",
    "they conclude that though these bounds are tighter than the cramer - rao bound , the numerical errors are still much larger than the computed lower bounds .    in this paper",
    "we explain the discrepancy between the monte carlo simulations and the results obtained from the covariance matrix .",
    "we demonstrate that the probability distribution of the estimated parameters can not be got from ` local ' methods such as the ones used earlier @xcite .",
    "since our main purpose in this paper is to demonstrate the validity of the statistical model , we initially use the simplified newtonian model of the waveform . in the newtonian case",
    "there are fewer parameters of the signal that one has to deal with , making the investigations simpler , analytically as well as computationally .",
    "we then specialize to the first post - newtonian case . here ,",
    "although the discrepancy is larger , the problem is similar at a qualitative level .    following finn @xcite we obtain an equation which relates the estimated parameters to the actual parameters of the signal for a given noise realisation .",
    "this equation is non - linear .",
    "finn linearises the equation and obtains the errors in terms of the covariance matrix .",
    "here we do not linearise the equation .",
    "we find that the equation has multiple solutions for the parameters in a certain sense and it is this multiplicity of roots forming islands in the parameter space which contributes significantly to the errors .",
    "thus the problem is of a global nature and any local approximation will be inadequate in explaining away the errors .",
    "moreover we suggest that the variance / covariance of the parameters is not a proper measure of the errors in this case .",
    "we therefore propose a new criterion by which the mle should be judged .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ waveform ]",
    "we briefly describe the gravitational wave signal waveform and the parameters on which it depends , namely , the amplitude , the time of arrival , the phase at arrival and the ` chirp times ' , which characterizes the time for the binary to evolve from some fiducial time to the actual merger .",
    "these parameters are found to be very convenient when we carry out monte carlo simulations .",
    "it turns out that the covariance matrix is independent of these parameters and hence it is sufficient to carry out the simulations only for a particular set of parameters .",
    "further in this section we also describe the characterstics of the noise that we assume will be present in the detector and briefly review the matched filtering technique . in section [ mcres ]",
    "we present the results of the monte carlo simulations for the newtonian case .",
    "we carry out transformations of the parameter space which bring out the chief features of the distribution of the estimated parameters .",
    "we show that the estimated parameters do not lie in a simply connected region around the signal parameters , but instead are distributed in multiple ` islands ' in the parameter space considered .",
    "we next present a geometric representation of our statistical model .",
    "we then apply this model to the newtonian chirp waveform , and compare the model with the monte carlo simulations . in section [ pnwave ]",
    "we deal with the post - newtonian waveform . finally in section  [ sec_con ]",
    "we summarise our results .",
    "we propose an alternative measure for the error which performs reasonably better than the variance as a measure of the error .",
    "when constructing templates for on - line detection , it is sufficient to work with the so called _ restricted _ post - newtonian gravitational waveform . in this approximation",
    "the post - newtonian corrections are incorporated only in the phase of the waveform , while ignoring corresponding corrections to the amplitude @xcite .",
    "consequently , the restricted post - newtonian waveforms only contain the dominant frequency equal to twice the orbital frequency of the binary computed up to the relevant order . in the restricted post - newtonian approximation the gravitational waves from a binary system of stars , modeled as point masses orbiting about each other in a circular orbit , induce a strain @xmath0 at the detector given by @xmath1 , \\label { wave}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency , the constant @xmath3 involves the distance to the binary , its reduced and total mass , and the antenna pattern of the detector @xcite and @xmath4 is the initial phase of the wave at some fiducial time @xmath5 .",
    "the phase of the waveform @xmath6 contains several pieces corresponding to different post - newtonian contributions which can be schematically written as @xmath7 the evolution of the phase depends on the masses of the two components of the binary , characterised by the reduced mass , @xmath8 and the total mass , @xmath9 of the system . here",
    "@xmath10 is the dominant newtonian part of the phase and @xmath11 represents the @xmath12th order post - newtonian correction to it .",
    "the newtonian part of the phase is sensitive only to a particular combination of the masses of the two stars , frequently characterised by its ` chirp mass ' , @xmath13 .",
    "we give below the waveform correct to the first post - newtonian order : @xmath14 \\nonumber,\\\\ \\varphi_1(t)&= & 4 \\pi f_s\\tau_1 \\left [ 1 - \\left ( { f\\over f_s } \\right ) ^{-1 } \\right ] \\label { phasen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is given implicitly by , @xmath15 + \\tau_1\\left[1 - \\left ( { f \\over f_s } \\right ) ^{-2 } \\right ] \\label { frequencyn},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants having dimensions of time given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency of the signal at @xmath21 the time elapsed starting from an epoch when the gravitational wave frequency is @xmath20 till the epoch when it becomes infinite will be referred to as the _ chirp time _ of the signal . in the quadrupole approximation @xmath16 is the chirp time whereas it is @xmath22 for the first post - newtonian case @xcite .",
    "the newtonian part of the phase is characterised by three parameters : ( i ) the _ time of arrival _",
    "@xmath23 when the signal first becomes _ visible _ in the detector , ( ii ) the _ phase _ @xmath4 of the signal at the time of arrival and ( iii ) the chirp mass . at this level of approximation two",
    "coalescing binary signals of the same chirp mass but of different sets of individual masses would be degenerate and thus exhibit exactly the same time evolution .",
    "this degeneracy is removed when post - newtonian corrections are included .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath4 are _ kinematical _ that fix the origin of the measurement of time and phase , respectively , while the newtonian and the post - newtonian chirp times are _ dynamical _ parameters in the sense that they dictate the evolution of the phase and the amplitude of the signal .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath23 have the dimensions of time .",
    "we convert them to dimensionless parameters by multiplying them with @xmath24 .",
    "thus we have the parameter set , @xmath25    in the stationary phase approximation the fourier transform of the restricted second - post - newtonian chirp waveform for positive frequencies is given by @xcite . @xmath26 \\ ,     \\label { ft}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , is the amplitude parameter depending on the distance to the binary , as well as the chirp mass and @xmath28 is a normalization constant to be fixed by means of a scalar product to be introduced later , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 the fourier transform is computed using the identity @xmath31 obeyed by real functions @xmath32      the output of a gravitational wave detector such as the ligo , will comprise of data segments , each of duration @xmath33 seconds , uniformly sampled with a sampling interval of @xmath34 , giving the number of samples in a single data train to be @xmath35 . each data train can be considered as a @xmath36-tuple @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the value of the output of the detector at time @xmath39 .",
    "the set of all such @xmath36-tuples constitutes an @xmath36-dimensional vector space @xmath40 where the addition of two vectors is accomplished by the addition of corresponding time samples . for later convenience",
    "we allow each sample to take complex values . a natural basis for this vector space",
    "is the _ time basis _",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the vector and component indices respectively .",
    "another basis which we shall use extensively is the fourier basis .",
    "a gravitational wave signal from a coalescing binary system can be characterised by a set of parameters @xmath44 belonging to some open set of the @xmath45-dimensional real space @xmath46 .",
    "the set of such signals @xmath47 constitutes a @xmath45-dimensional manifold @xmath48 which is embedded in the vector space @xmath40 .",
    "note that greek characters in boldface denote the full collection of parameters characterising the signal .",
    "the parameters of the binary can be regarded as coordinates on the manifold .",
    "the basic problem of signal analysis is thus to determine whether the detector output vector @xmath49 is the sum of a signal vector and a noise vector , @xmath50 , or just the noise vector , @xmath51 , and furthermore to identify which particular signal vector , among all possible .",
    "the latter is relevant to this paper where we are interested in estimating the parameters and also the errors made in such a estimation .",
    "errors in the estimation arise because the noise contaminates the data .    the noise in ground based laser interferometric detectors will have , in general , both a gaussian and a non - gaussian component .",
    "the main sources for the gaussian component are the shot noise due to photon counting , the thermal noise in the mirror suspensions alongwith the mirror itself and seismic noise .",
    "the non - gaussian component can be contributed by numerous sources like sudden strain releases in the mirror suspension wires or even if lightning strikes .",
    "it should be possible to remove most of the non - gaussian component by using environmental monitors and looking for coincidence among detectors located at widely separated sites .",
    "it is , therefore , assumed usually that the detector noise will be a gaussian random process . over a time scale of hours , it can also be assumed to be stationary .",
    "the power spectral density of the gaussian noise component rises very steeply towards the low frequency end due to seismic effects . at the high frequency end",
    "it is dominated by photon shot noise which leads to a rise towards higher frequencies .",
    "thus the data will have to be bandpassed with a low frequency seismic cutoff , @xmath20 , and a high frequency cutoff , @xmath52 .",
    "we use the power spectral density expected for the initial ligo as given in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we choose @xmath53 hz and @xmath54 hz .    in the absence of the signal the output will contain only noise drawn from a stochastic process which can be described by a probability distribution on the vector space @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the noise has its mean zero , or that is , @xmath55 , where the overbar denotes an ensemble average .",
    "then the covariance matrix of the noise @xmath56 is defined as , @xmath57 if the noise is assumed to be stationary and ergodic then there exists a noise autocorrelation function @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "in the fourier basis it can be shown that the components of the noise vector are statistically independent @xcite and the covariance matrix in the fourier basis will contain only diagonal terms whose values will be strictly positive : @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues .",
    "the diagonal elements of this matrix @xmath61 constitute the discrete representation of the power spectrum of the noise @xmath62 .",

    "we use the fit to the noise curve as given in @xcite : @xmath73.\\ ] ] the value of @xmath74 will not concern us since what matters is only the ratio of the signal amplitude to that of the noise , in other words the snr .",
    "we shall set the value of @xmath74 to be unity and accordingly adjust the amplitude of the signal to get the required snr .      in the absence of any prior information",
    "it must be assumed that all the parameter values , within their respective range , are equally likely to occur . in such a case ,",
    "the method of maximum liklihood can be used .",
    "when the noise is a stationary gaussian random process , the method of mle reduces to the so called matched filtering technique .",
    "matched filtering involves correlating the detector output with a bank of matched filters each of which corresponds to the signal waveform for a fixed set of parameters . to this end",
    ", we define a scalar product on @xmath40 . in the continuum limit the scalar product between two vectors @xmath72 and @xmath75",
    "is given by , @xmath76 where , the hermitian property of the fourier transform of a real function has been used to restrict the domain of integration to positive frequencies .",
    "@xmath62 is the power spectral density of the noise .",
    "the fourier domain is convenient since stationarity of the noise has been assumed .",
    "the norm of a vector @xmath77 will be denoted by @xmath78 . in eqn .",

    "we choose the value of @xmath28 such that @xmath79 . from the definition of the scalar product in eqn .",

    "( [ ft ] ) it follows that , @xmath80 the integrand in the above equation , @xmath81 is plotted in fig .",
    "this function peaks at around @xmath82hz and a major contribution to the integral comes from a region around @xmath83hz .",
    "we shall use normalized matched filters , that is , we set @xmath84 .",
    "henceforth we shall use the symbols @xmath85 to indicate indices whose range of values includes @xmath86 which as a index denotes the amplitude parameter , _",
    "i.e. @xmath87_. indices @xmath88 will not include the amplitude parameter and will never take the value @xmath86 .",
    "the output called the correlation @xmath89 of the matched filter with parameters @xmath90 is then just the scalar product given by , @xmath91 given the data vector @xmath72 , the correlation is computed for the entire feasible range of parameters , continuously over the kinematic parameters @xmath23 and @xmath4 and for discrete values of the dynamical parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the filters corresponding to the discrete values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 constitute the filter bank . the maximum of @xmath89 is computed and compared with a preassigned threshold determined from the false alarm probability .",
    "a detection is announced if the maximum of @xmath89 crosses the threshold .",
    "the parameters @xmath92 for which the correlation is maximised are the mle of the parameters of the signal .",
    "however , these will in general differ from the actual signal parameters @xmath93 due to the presence of noise .",
    "the difference @xmath94 is the error made in estimating the parameters .",
    "when the signal is weak as compared to the noise ( low snr ) , the estimated parameters in general will differ by a large margin from the true ones , while in the limit of high snr , the two will almost coincide .",
    "thus in general @xmath95 is not small .",
    "let the data vector be @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the amplitude of the signal and @xmath93 are the remaining parameters .",
    "we have separated the amplitude as it occurs in the signal as just a scale factor multiplying the signal .",
    "the snr is defined as , @xmath98 from eqs .",
    "( [ ft ] ) and ( [ scal ] ) we see that the snr is equal to the amplitude parameter of the signal , @xmath97 .",

    "the process of maximization over the parameters is however a nonlinear process and hence the statistics of @xmath89 will be non - gaussian . for a given realization of noise , we assume that the global maximum of @xmath89 will also be a local maximum .",
    "this assumption depends on the specific nature of the waveform and the filter bank . the equations which will be satisfied at the estimated parameters @xmath99 , are , @xmath100    in the limit of high snr the mean square errors in the measurement of the parameters are characterised by the so called covariance matrix @xmath101 @xcite defined as , @xmath102^{ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the expression for the fourier transform in the stationary phase approximation ( eqn .",

    "<S> with the on going construction of several large and medium scale laser interferometric gravitational wave antennas around the globe , the problem of the detection of gravitational waves has acquired great impetus . since gravitational wave signals from astrophysical sources </S>",
    "<S> are expected to be weak , despite the state of the art technology being employed , the development of optimal signal extraction techniques and the consequent accurate determination of the parameters of the signal is of major importance . coalescing binary systems are one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> one reason is that such sources are easier to model and thus one can design detection strategies tuned to such signals . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of attention has been devoted in the literature studying such techniques and most of the work has revolved around matched filtering and maximum likelihood estimation .    in a previous work , </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations were carried out of the detection process using matched filtering for the initial ligo / virgo configuration for the first post - newtonian corrected coalescing binary waveform . </S>",
    "<S> we had compared the results of our simulations with available estimates , obtained from covariance matrix considerations , of the errors in the determination of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our results showed that the covariance matrix underestimates , by over a factor of two , the actual errors in the estimation of parameters even when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is as high as 10 . </S>",
    "<S> sources having snr higher than 10 are expected to be few and hence this issue is of major concern .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we probe the question as to why the monte carlo simulations give such high errors as opposed to those obtained via the covariance matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we present , a _ computationally viable _ statistical model of the distribution , of the maximum likelihood estimates ( mle ) , of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces the essential features of the monte carlo simulations , thereby explaining the large root mean square errors in the estimates , obtained in numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the chief reason for the large errors seems to be the fact that the probability distribution of the estimated parameters is multimodal . </S>",
    "<S> though only the central peak ( corresponding to the actual values of the parameters ) is dominant , the subsidary peaks occur ` far ' away thereby contributing to large variances . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the variance or the standard deviation of an estimated parameter may not provide the best measure of the error , for the kind of situation we encounter here . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose another criterion by which the mle should be judged .    in order to illustrate the model we have considered the newtonian as well as the first post - newtonian corrected waveform . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed gaussian noise , with a power spectrum typical of the ligo / virgo type of detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the model we have used , however , is quite general , and robust , and will be relevant to many other parameter estimation problems . </S>"
