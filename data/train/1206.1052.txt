    "in the 1980s astronomers discovered a new class of infrared selected galaxies known as ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and characterized by @xmath4 l@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the 81000 @xmath7 m luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another important topic during this time period was the study of the evolution of quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) where accretion onto the supermassive black hole at the center of a massive galaxy gives rise to @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the 210 kev luminosity .",
    "ulirgs and quasars have similar bolometric luminosities ( 10@xmath1110@xmath12 erg s@xmath9 ) and optical observations suggest many ulirgs have nuclear sources of non - thermal ionizing radiation and disturbed morphologies @xcite .",
    "thus , @xcite suggested that when two gas rich galaxies merge , gas and dust will fall into the nucleus of the resulting galaxy , triggering a massive starburst and a quasar .",
    "thirty years later , the connection between ulirgs , agn , and major mergers is still an area of active research .",
    "recent simulations show that , indeed , gas rich major mergers are capable of triggering large starbursts and bright agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by looking for ulirgs with strong x - ray emission or a power - law spectra in the",

    "* ) . furthermore",
    ", both the fraction of ulirgs that host agn and the fraction of ulirgs whose bolometric luminosities are dominated by agn emission , appear to increase strongly with luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , @xcite showed that the fraction of ulirgs triggered by major mergers increases with luminosity .",
    "thus , it is expected that a significant fraction of ulirgs host agn and were triggered by gas rich major mergers .",
    "however , these studies tend to focus on ulirgs with @xmath13 .",
    "far - infrared observations by the _ herschel space telescope _ have opened a new window on the @xmath14 ulirg population .",
    "interestingly , _",
    "herschel _ observations show that at high redshift major mergers are not necessary to trigger ulirgs @xcite . analyzing _",
    "herschel _ observations of the botes field , @xcite point out that @xmath330@xmath1 of optically - faint @xmath15 ulirgs show obvious signs of a recent merger .",
    "herschel _ observations of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) and the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos ) fields find that most @xmath14 ulirgs are not in a starburst mode of star formation @xcite .",
    "instead , the increased gas fraction in high redshift galaxies allows normal secular star formation to power ulirgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent cosmological simulations confirm these observational results , finding that more than half of high redshift ulirgs can be accounted for through mechanisms other than major mergers @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that at high redshift the agn - ulirg connection may be quite different than the connection observed locally .",
    "@xcite computed an agn population model that constrains the space density and eddington ratio evolution of agn triggered by major mergers by considering the hard x - ray luminosity function ( hxlf ) , x - ray agn number counts , the x - ray background , and the local mass density of supermassive black holes .",
    "thus , a model of the major merger population can be computed by combining this description of the evolving luminosity function of merger - triggered agn with the @xcite model for the time evolution of merger - triggered starbursts .",
    "similarly , a model merger spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be calculated by combining agn infrared spectra computed with the photoionization code cloudy @xcite with the @xcite star formation templates .",
    "this method is used here to determine the maximum contribution of mergers to the ulirg population at @xmath16 .",
    "a @xmath17cdm cosmology is assumed with @xmath18 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and @xmath19 .",
    "the evolving hxlf of major merger - triggered agn presented by @xcite is used to determine the space density and luminosity distribution of merger - triggered agn . @xcite",
    "combined an observationally motivated major merger rate @xcite and a theoretical agn light curve @xcite to determine the contribution of major merger - triggered agn to the hxlf .",

    "@xcite find that the best fit to the observed hxlf , x - ray agn number counts , x - ray background , and mass density of supermassive black holes is achieved when @xmath27 yrs , @xmath25 = 2.5 , and @xmath26 = 0.7 for agn triggered by mergers .",
    "it is assumed that all mergers trigger agn and therefore this model provides an upper limit to the contribution of major mergers to the agn population .    here , this merger - triggered agn hxlf is converted to an infrared luminosity function using agn seds computed using cloudy version c08.00 @xcite as described in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "these seds cover the sub - mm to very hard x - ray wavelength regimes and incorporate the direct emission from the agn , the diffuse emission radiated along the line of sight by the obscuring material around the agn , and the emission reflected off the inner surface of the obscuring cloud . as in @xcite , the neutral hydrogen density of the clouds",
    "is assigned such that compton thin clouds have @xmath28 @xmath29 and compton thick ( ct ) clouds have @xmath30 @xmath29 , in accordance with the observed densities of typical molecular clouds . the inner radius of the obscuring material is assumed to be @xmath010 pc .",
    "as we compare against observations of an ensemble of sources , instead of fitting individual sources , a simple agn torus model is appropriate for this study .",
    "moreover , as discussed in section [ sect : results ] , the infrared emission of ulirgs is dominated by star formation processes , thus the results presented here are not dependent on the torus model used .",
    "the evolving star formation rate , @xmath31 , of the merger - triggered starburst is determined using the model of @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath32 where @xmath33 = 0.1 gyr is the timescale of the merger - triggered starburst and @xmath34 is the total mass of stars born during the merger - triggered starburst .",
    "once @xmath35 is determined , @xmath6 due to star formation is calculated using @xcite l@xmath5/(m@xmath5 yr@xmath9 ) , yields an infrared luminosity density @xmath010@xmath1 lower . ]",
    "@xmath36l_{\\odot}.   \\label{eq : conv}\\ ] ] in order to combine the agn and starburst models , the time delay between the triggering of the starburst and the triggering of the agn must be considered .",
    "observational studies and simulations show that @xmath37 tends to peak @xmath0100 myr after @xmath35 peaks @xcite .",
    "therefore , the starburst is triggered such that the time delay between the peak star formation rate , @xmath38 , and the peak agn eddington ratio , @xmath39 , @xmath40 = 100 myr .",
    "scenarios where @xmath41 and 1 gyr are also considered .",
    "once the merger occurs , the agn light curve of equation [ eq : lightcurve ] and the star formation rate evolution of equation [ eq : sfr ] determine the evolution of the system .",
    "thus , the space density of major mergers at redshift @xmath42 is set by the merger rate .",
    "the starburst model is triggered at @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the appropriate change in redshift for @xmath40 at @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding agn is triggered at @xmath42 .",
    "the evolution of the starburst is governed by equation [ eq : sfr ] and the agn luminosity evolves according to equation [ eq : lightcurve ] .",

    "@xmath47 , and merger seds set , the merger infrared luminosity function , @xmath48 , is calculated as @xmath49 where @xmath10 and @xmath6 are computed using the combined agn - starburst seds . the infrared luminosity density , @xmath50 , is then computed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 l@xmath5 and @xmath53 l@xmath5 . to calculate the ulirg @xmath54 , @xmath55 is increased to 10@xmath56 l@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath54 calculated here is then compared with the infrared luminosity density of agn and their host galaxies , @xmath57 , measured by @xcite and the total infrared luminosity density , @xmath58 , measured by @xcite .",

    "the maximum ulirg @xmath54/@xmath57 and @xmath54/@xmath58 are then investigated .",
    "in order to prevent over - predicting the maximum @xmath54 , we consider the 24 @xmath7 m number count of x - ray selected agn following equation 1 of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath61 m@xmath5 the bright end of the 24 @xmath7 m number count is over - predicted by a factor @xmath622 .",
    "these same models also over - predict the local ulirg @xmath58 . thus",
    ", 10@xmath63 m@xmath5 is an upper limit on the average @xmath34 for the population of major mergers .",
    "figure [ fig : numcts ] shows the number count for mergers with @xmath40 = 100 myr and @xmath64 m@xmath5 . as the observed number count is from the goods fields @xcite , it is not surprising that the model slightly over - predicts the bright end of the observed count since goods is a narrow field survey and likely misses bright , rare sources which are better accounted for by wide field surveys .",
    "figure [ fig : frac ] shows the maximum ulirg @xmath54/@xmath57 and ulirg @xmath54/@xmath58 that does not significantly over - predicting the 24 @xmath7 m number count . for the model shown in figure [ fig : frac ] , @xmath40 = 100 myr and @xmath64 m@xmath5 .",
    "the top left frame of figure [ fig : frac ] shows that mergers can account for the local ulirg @xmath57 , however , as shown in the lower left frame , @xmath54/@xmath65 for local ulirgs .",
    "interestingly , if we remove the starburst from our seds , we find that emission from agn alone can contribute @xmath320@xmath1 of the local ulirg @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we confirm that the @xmath6 of ulirgs hosting agn tends to be dominated by star formation .    if @xmath64 m@xmath5 , major mergers can account for the local ulirg @xmath57 for @xmath40 = 0 and 1 gyr .",
    "thus , the ability for mergers to account for the local agn ulirg population is not strongly dependent on @xmath40 . the local ulirg @xmath54/@xmath58 reduces to @xmath00.20 for both @xmath40 = 0 and 1 gyr . if @xmath40 = 100 myr and @xmath66 m@xmath5 , mergers can not account for the local population of ulirgs hosting agn .",
    "observations and simulations suggest that @xmath34 is proportional to the galaxy stellar mass , @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 with the fraction @xmath69 on the order of , but @xmath700.1 @xcite .",
    "if we assume a distribution of @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 , with the distribution of @xmath67 described by the @xcite stellar mass function , the agn number count and the local ulirg @xmath58 are over - predicted by at least a factor of 2 . however ,",
    "if @xmath73 , the model predictions are in agreement with the agn number count and the local ulirg @xmath54/@xmath74 , only 0.02 higher than the simple calculation with a single @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath73 , @xmath75 m@xmath5 . therefore , for @xmath40 = 01 gyr and @xmath76 m@xmath5 , the local ulirg @xmath54/@xmath77 and the local ulirg @xmath54/@xmath78 0.200.28 .",
    "major mergers can account for at most a quarter of the local ulirg @xmath58 .",
    "this suggests that a large fraction of local ulirgs are triggered by mechanisms other than the coalescence of two massive gas rich galaxies , such as minor mergers , interactions , and secular processes . by @xmath2 , the ulirg @xmath54/@xmath79 and by @xmath80 , the ulirg @xmath54/@xmath81 . at @xmath2 , the ulirg @xmath54/@xmath82 .",
    "indeed , simulations by @xcite predict that at @xmath83 , the ulirg @xmath54/@xmath84 , in good agreement with the findings of this study . as major mergers are much more common at @xmath85 than @xmath86",
    ", this suggests that secular processes are even more important for triggering ulirgs at high redshift .",
    "_ herschel _ has provided observational evidence that major mergers are not necessary at @xmath14 to trigger ulirgs @xcite ; a finding that has been confirmed by simulations @xcite .    at @xmath14",
    "the majority of ulirgs appear to be scaled up versions of local normal star forming galaxies .",
    "these high redshift ulirgs tend to have cooler far - infrared dust temperatures @xcite and stronger pah emission @xcite than local ulirgs .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the 8 @xmath7 m flux to the total infrared flux of high redshift ulirgs , @xcite find that most @xmath14 ulirgs lie on the infrared main sequence and are in a normal star forming mode of evolution .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite find that at @xmath87 and @xmath15 , agn tend to be hosted by galaxies on the main sequence of star formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "observations and simulations both point out that high redshift galaxies are more gas rich than local galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that galaxies with large reservoirs of gas and dust are capable of fueling ulirgs without being triggered by a major merger .",
    "@xcite do find that some high redshift ulirgs are in a starburst mode , possibly triggered by a merger .",
    "moreover , @xcite find evidence for a population of very highly obscured agn embedded in these compact dusty starbursts .",
    "other observational studies also find ct agn ( @xmath88 @xmath89 ) candidates in high redshift dusty starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite explains that the gas and dust funneled into the central regions of the merger remnant galaxy will fuel a burst of star formation , rapid black hole accretion , and will obscure the resulting agn .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of ct agn are expected to be recently triggered , likely by a major merger , and accreting very rapidly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the results of this study are consistent with the merger - triggered ct agn scenario , but , as @xmath54/@xmath82 for ulirgs at @xmath2 , the contribution of these merger - triggered ct agn to the @xmath14 ulirg population must be fairly small .",
    "the fraction of agn that are ct is hard to observationally constrain due to the severe obscuration that defines ct agn and agn population models predict a wide range for the ct fraction ( see * ? ? ?",

    "local ulirg seds are often divided into two groups , warm and cool , where warm ulirg seds are characterized by @xmath90 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath91 is the 25 @xmath7 m flux and @xmath92 is the 60 @xmath7 m flux . according to @xcite , warm ulirgs are 1530@xmath1 of the bright galaxy survey sources @xcite .",
    "the merger model used here does produce warm ulirg seds with @xmath93 at all redshifts ; thus mergers can account for the local population of warm ulirgs .",
    "@xcite found that galaxies on the main sequence of normal star formation , including galaxies hosting agn , tend to have cooler dust temperatures than star - bursting galaxies .",
    "because starbursts triggered by major mergers are expected to be more compact than secular star formation , merger - triggered starbursts will be characterized by higher dust temperatures than normal star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> this drop is likely due to high redshift galaxies being more gas rich and therefore able to achieve high star formation rates through secular evolution . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we find that major mergers can account for the local population of warm ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that selecting high redshift warm ulirgs will allow for the identification of high redshift merger - triggered ulirgs . as major mergers are likely to trigger very highly obscured agn </S>",
    "<S> , a significant fraction of the high redshift warm ulirg population may host compton thick agn . </S>"
