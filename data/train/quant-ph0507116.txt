    "classical search algorithms are robust .",
    "if we reduce the problem size , the algorithm has fewer items to search and the performance of the algorithm will almost always improve . quantum search algorithms depend on delicate interference effects ,",
    "any change in parameters leads to significantly different results .",
    "for example , if we reduce the number of states in the database by a factor of four , a quantum search algorithm that would have previously succeeded , will now fail with certainty .",
    "quantum algorithms usually exhibit oscillatory behavior in their performance characteristics . as a result of this ,",
    "if there is some quantity that we want to maximize , e.g. the probability of the system being in marked states , we will need very precise knowledge of the problem parameters .",
    "given such knowledge , it is easy to fine - tune the algorithm so that it achieves a probability of success of unity . what happens if we do not have this knowledge ?",
    "this can be a serious handicap for a quantum search algorithm .",
    "this paper describes a way around this problem .",
    "the original quantum search algorithm @xcite considered the problem of finding a marked item in a large unsorted database with minimum queries to the database . for this type of problem",
    "it is usually enough to be able to obtain the correct answer with a constant probability since the procedure can be repeated a logarithmic number of times to drive the probability exponentially close to unity . in that problem",
    "a logarithmic factor was not significant since the quantum search algorithm gave a square - root asymptotic improvement .",
    "however there are other important problems where the additional queries create a significant overhead and need to be minimized , e.g. when we are limited to a single query and have to find the answer with a probability approaching unity .",
    "one field in which this type of problem occurs is in pattern recognition and image analysis where each query requires a lot of signal processing and the consequences of making an error are catastrophic .",
    "consider the situation where a large fraction of the items in a database are marked , but the precise fraction of marked items is not known . the goal is to find a single marked item with as high a probability as possible in a single query to the database .",
    "for concreteness , say some unknown fraction @xmath6 of the items are marked , with @xmath1 uniformly distributed  in the range @xmath7 with equal probability .",
    "the search algorithm returns an item , if it is a marked item the algorithm is said to succeed , else if it is unmarked , the algorithm is said to fail .",
    "classically the smallest error that can be obtained is @xmath8 . to achieve this , uniformly guess an input and evaluate the function .",
    "if the function outputs 1 , you re done , otherwise guess again and cross your fingers ( because you have no more evaluations left ) .",
    "one can not do better than @xmath9 classically . in this paper",
    "we show that the probability of failure for the new scheme is @xmath10 whereas that of the best ( possible ) classical scheme and that of the best known quantum schemes are both @xmath11 .    before considering the specific problem mentioned above ,",
    "let us describe a general framework .",
    "consider the following transformation@xmath12 @xmath13 is an arbitrary unitary transformation , @xmath14 & @xmath15 denote selective phase shifts of the respective state(s ) by @xmath16 note that if we were to change these phase shifts from @xmath17 to @xmath18  we would get one iteration of the amplitude amplification algorithm @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the next section shows that if @xmath13 drives the state vector from a source @xmath19 to a target @xmath20 state with a probability of @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 , then the transformation ( [ transf ] ) drives the state vector from the source to the same target state with a probability of @xmath23 the deviation from the @xmath24 state has hence fallen from @xmath1  to @xmath25 .",
    "note that this is different from the amplitude amplification framework where the _ amplitudes _ were getting amplified ; over here it is more convenient to present the results in terms of the _",
    "probabilities_.    the striking aspect of this result is that it holds for _ any _ kind of deviation from the @xmath24  state . unlike the standard search ( or amplitude amplification )",
    "algorithm which would greatly overshoot the target state when @xmath1 is small ( figure 1 ) ; the new algorithm will always move towards the target . as shown in section 5",
    ", this feature of the framework can be used to develop algorithms that are more robust to variations in the problem parameters .",
    "[ ptb ]    qsearch2__1.eps",
    "we analyze the effect of the transformation @xmath26 when it is applied to the @xmath27 state .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , @xmath14 & @xmath15 denote selective phase shifts of the respective state(s ) by @xmath17 ( @xmath24 for target , @xmath28 for source ) .",
    "we show that if @xmath29 then @xmath30    in the rest of this section , the greek alphabet @xmath31 will be used to denote @xmath16 start with @xmath27 and apply the operations @xmath32 & @xmath33 if we analyze the effect of the operations , one by one , just as in the original quantum search algorithm @xcite , we find that it leads to the following superposition ( this calculation is carried out in the appendix):@xmath34    to calculate the deviation of this superposition from @xmath35 , consider the amplitude of the above superposition in non - target states .",
    "the probability is given by the absolute square of the corresponding amplitude:@xmath36    substituting @xmath29 the above quantity becomes@xmath37@xmath38",
    "the best classical algorithm is to select a random state and see if it is a @xmath24  state ( one query ) .",
    "if yes , return this state ; if not , pick another random state and return that without any querying .",
    "note that this algorithm requires a single query , not two .",
    "the probability of failure is equal to that of not getting a single @xmath24  state in two random picks since if either of the two states is a marked state , the algorithm will succeed .",
    "this probability is equal to @xmath39 since @xmath1 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the overall failure probability becomes@xmath40    [ ptb ]    oracle__2.eps      boyer , brassard , hyer and tapp @xcite first described in detail an algorithm that succeeds with probability approaching 1 , regardless of the number of solutions ( it s a classical algorithm that uses quantum searching as a subroutine ; of course , it can be made fully quantum . ) the first quantum algorithm to be able to search in a single query with a success probability approaching 1 was given by mosca @xcite .",
    "mosca observed that the quantum counting algorithm of @xcite ( based on the original searching algorithm ) produces a solution with probability converging to @xmath41 .",
    "one easily converts this to an algorithm with probability of success converging to @xmath42 .",
    "thus by using this algorithm as a sub - routine in another quantum search , we get success probability converging to @xmath43 .",
    "( this appears to be based on the observation in @xcite that an algorithm that succeeds with probability exactly @xmath42 can be amplified to one with success probability exactly @xmath43 using only one quantum search iterate ) . in other words",
    ", the technique mosca uses is to take a search algorithm that succeeds with probability @xmath44 and then use one quantum search iteration to map it to an algorithm that succeeds with probability @xmath45 . using this scheme ,",
    "if the fraction of marked states of the database is @xmath0 , one can easily obtain a marked state with a probability of error of @xmath46 by means of a single quantum query .",
    "the overall failure probability in this case becomes @xmath47    a recent quantum search based algorithm for this problem is by younes et al @xcite ( actually it is somewhat unfair to compare it to the other algorithms since this was specifically designed to perform well when the success probability was close to @xmath48 not close to @xmath49 .",
    "this finds a solution with a probability of @xmath50 where @xmath51 = number of queries and @xmath52 ( ( 59 ) from @xcite)@xmath53 when @xmath54 the success probability becomes : @xmath55 hence the probability of error becomes @xmath56 .",
    "the overall failure probability becomes @xmath57",
    "as in the quantum search algorithm , encode the @xmath58 items in the database in terms of @xmath59 qubits .",
    "the algorithm consists of applying the transformation @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "w is the walsh - hadamard transformation and @xmath62 is the state with all qubits in the @xmath63 state .",
    "after this an observation is made which makes the system collapse into a basis state .    in order to analyze the performance of this algorithm , note that the algorithm is merely the phase shift transformation @xmath26 applied to  @xmath27 which has already been analyzed in section 3 .",
    "@xmath13  is the w - h transform ( @xmath64 ) and the state @xmath28  is the @xmath62 state ( state with all qubits in the 0 state ) , then @xmath65 where @xmath1 lies in the range @xmath66 therefore after applying the transformation @xmath67 to @xmath68  , the probability of being in a non-@xmath24  state becomes @xmath25 , i.e. the overall failure probability becomes @xmath69    [ ptb ]    comparison3__3.eps    the performance of the algorithm is graphically illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "in practice , a database search would use multiple queries .",
    "the technique discussed above extends neatly to the multi - query situation .",
    "as described in @xcite , the multi - query algorithm based on the @xmath17 phase - shift transformation is able to reduce the probability of error to @xmath70 after @xmath51 queries to the database .",
    "a  classical algorithm reduces the probability of error to @xmath71 note that @xmath72 gives the same results as in section 5 .",
    "both the single query , as well as the multi - query algorithms are asymptotically optimal in the limit of small @xmath73 .",
    "this is separately proved in @xcite .",
    "connections to control and error correction might be evident .",
    "let us say that we are trying to drive a system from an @xmath28  to a @xmath24  state / subspace .",
    "the transformation that we have available for this is @xmath13 which drives it from @xmath28  to @xmath24  with a probability @xmath74 of @xmath75 i.e. the probability of error in this transformation is @xmath1 .",
    "then the composite transformation @xmath76  will reduce the error to @xmath77    this technique is applicable whenever the transformations @xmath78 can be implemented .",
    "this will be the case when errors are systematic errors or slowly varying errors , e.g. due to environmental degradation of some component .",
    "this would not apply to errors that come about as a result of sudden disturbances from the environment .",
    "it is further assumed that the transformation @xmath13 can be inverted with exactly the same error .",
    "traditionally quantum error correction is carried out at the single qubit level where individual errors are corrected , each error being corrected in a separate way . with the machinery of this paper , errors can be corrected without ever needing to identify the error syndrome .",
