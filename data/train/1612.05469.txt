    "the study of linear statistics of eigenvalues of random matrices has played a major role for the applications of random matrix theory to physical problems , like quantum transport @xcite , quantum entanglement @xcite , etc , as it was emphasized in our recent papers @xcite . whereas previous work has considered _ unrestricted _ sums of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is the spectrum of eigenvalues of a random matrix , the question of _ truncated _ linear statistics ( tls ) of the form @xmath13 was recently raised in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "there , we have considered the case where the eigenvalues contributing to the partial sum are further constrained to be the @xmath3 largest ( or smallest ) ones , which corresponds to interpolating between two well studied types of problems  : for @xmath14 , the statistical analysis of the linear statistics @xmath12 @xcite ( and many other references ) , and for @xmath15 , the study of the distribution of the largest ( or smallest ) eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyse the statistical properties of tls _ in the absence of further restriction _ concerning the ordering of the @xmath2 eigenvalues  ; we will see that lifting this restriction has strong implications on the analysis and the results . for convenience , we rescale the tls as @xmath16 where the exponent @xmath17 is chosen such that @xmath18 remains of order @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath17 depends on the function @xmath21 and the matrix ensemble under consideration .",
    "the general scenario presented in the paper is valid for any choice of function @xmath21 .",
    "moreover it applies to different matrix ensembles , although we will focus on wishart matrices ( i.e. the laguerre ensemble of random matrices ) . in the sequel , for reasons",
    "explained later , we will consider the case @xmath11 , leading to @xmath22 . denoting by @xmath23 the joint probability distribution function for the eigenvalues ( for the laguerre ensemble , eq .",
    "below ) , we can write the distribution of @xmath18 as  : @xmath24 here , @xmath23 is a symmetric function of its @xmath10 arguments . due to the restriction to a fraction of the eigenvalues in",
    ", the only avalaible approaches seem to be the orthogonal polynomial technique , which provides naturally the @xmath3-point correlation functions , and the coulomb gas method .",
    "however the former is restricted to the unitary class and does not permit a simple analysis of the large deviations .",
    "for this reason , we will use the coulomb gas technique . because the method deals with the eigenvalue density , the restriction to a fraction of eigenvalues requires to introduce `` occupation numbers '' @xmath25 and write the tls as  : @xmath26 where @xmath27 if the eigenvalue @xmath28 contributes to the sum and @xmath29 otherwise .",
    "note that subset sums @xmath30 of eigenvalues of certain random matrices recently appeared in the spectral analysis of fermionic systems  @xcite .",
    "since the sum should contain @xmath31 eigenvalues , the @xmath32 $ ] acceptable configurations @xmath33 verify @xmath34 recently , the case where the summation is restricted to the @xmath31 largest ( or smallest ) eigenvalues was considered in ref .",
    "this corresponds to considering the configuration @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here",
    ", we consider the same problem in the absence of this restriction , which leads us to introduce a new ensemble described by the joint distribution for the two sets of random numbers @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 the heaviside step function .",

    "the multiple integral is dominated by the optimal configuration for the two sets of random numbers .",
    "as the two parameters @xmath48 and @xmath18 are tuned , we obtain different types of optimal configurations , which are interpreted as different `` phases '' .",

    "as one increases @xmath18 for fixed @xmath48 , one encounters three phases described below , the phase transitions taking places at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which defines two lines in the @xmath49 plane ( see also fig .  [",
