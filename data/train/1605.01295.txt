    "while @xmath1he has long been the archetypal bosonic quantum fluid @xcite , the last few decades have witnessed a considerable increase in the number of relevant bosonic fluids available for experiments @xcite .",
    "an important issue is determining the extent to which the properties of a bose fluid are affected by the details of the inter  atomic interaction , @xmath2 . in the case of cold atoms at very low densities it is known @xcite that under most conditions only one parameter of such interaction plays a role in determining the properties of the system , namely the scattering length at low energy . the situation is different for systems at large density , in which case @xmath2 explicitly enters into the microscopic description of the system .",
    "a number of model interactions have been studied by many ",
    "body theories and simulations @xcite .",
    "the he  he interaction is characterized by a hard repulsive core at short distance and by a rather weak attraction at larger distances , as typified by the lennard ",
    "jones form .",
    "in fact , it is well - established that most properties of such system are determined by the hard core , the attractive tail playing a minor role @xcite .",
    "one  component charged bose fluids differ from the previous case in two ways : the weak divergence of @xmath2 at @xmath3 , allowing particles to overlap , and the long range of the interaction .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction , also called yukawa interaction , combines in an interesting way a soft short  range repulsion and a finite range .",
    "also , the interest of this last system in two dimensions ( 2d ) relies in a deep and truly fascinating connection with the thermodynamics of abrikosov vortices in type - ii superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 k phase diagram of the 2d - screned coulomb ( 2d - sc ) bose system is rather interesting . in a hard core system like @xmath1he",
    "there is a phase transition from a superfluid state at low density to a solid phase at high density . on the opposite ,",
    "the coulomb system has a solid phase at low density and a fluid phase at high density @xcite .",
    "the 2d - sc bose system has features of both those systems .",
    "when the mass of the particles is sufficiently small , the kinetic energy dominates over the potential energy and quantum fluctuations are enhanced , whence the system is fluid at all densities . below a critical threshold ,",
    "the system is solid for intermediate values of the density and fluid at both very low and high density .",
    "the 2d - sc bose system at @xmath4 k has been studied by variational theory @xcite and by exact ground  state methods , diffusion monte carlo @xcite and shadow path integral ground state ( spigs ) simulations @xcite , and by exact finite - temperature path integral monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the main focus of those studies was the phase diagram of the system , and the calculation of ground  state equilibrium properties .",
    "in previous work @xcite only a scant attention was given to dynamical properties .",
    "in this work we present the first study of dynamical properties of the 2d - sc bose system in the fluid phase using state  of  the  art quantum monte carlo and analytic continuation techniques .",
    "the dynamical structure factor of a many - body system unveils considerable information about the collective excitations of the system as probed by external perturbations coupling to the density @xcite . for a @xmath4 k system , the dynamical structure factor , @xmath5 ,",
    "is defined as the fourier transform of the intermediate scattering function @xmath6 , which is the correlation function of the fourier transform of the density operator , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 being the number of particles , @xmath10 the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath11 the ground state of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 within the born approximation , the dynamical structure factor is related to the differential scattering cross section of particle or electromagnetic radiation through the multiplication by a purely kinematic factor @xcite .",
    "this important property makes the dynamical structure factor a quantity of paramount importance in the experimental and theoretical investigation of many - body quantum systems , ranging from superfluid and solid @xmath13he @xcite to ultracold atomic gases @xcite .    for strongly",
    " interacting systems , the quantitative study of the dynamical structure factor must typically be supported by numerical calculations or simulations .",
    "the first application of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods to the calculation of the dynamical structure factor dates back to @xcite for lattice systems and @xcite for homogeneous systems .",
    "further developments have made possible the calculation of @xmath5 in systems of @xmath13he atoms @xcite , as well as in two  dimensional ( 2d ) homogeneous electron gases and systems of @xmath14he atoms @xcite , and systems of bose hard spheres @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we compute the dynamical structure factor of a zero  temperature system of 2d - sc bosons , using the shadow path integral ground state method ( spigs ) @xcite to compute the imaginary  time intermediate scattering function , @xmath15 ( see equation ) , and a genetic algorithm , known as genetic inversion via falsification of theories ( gift ) @xcite , to retrieve @xmath5 from @xmath15 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , the model of 2d - sc bosons",
    "is introduced and the spigs method is briefly reviewed . in subection [ sec:2b ] ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath15 and its inversion by means of the gift algorithm are described .",

    "the pigs method provides estimates of ground  state properties and imaginary  time correlations functions , which are only affected by two errors : ( i ) the use of a finite imaginary time of projection in , and ( ii ) the use of a finite time step in .",
    "the biases introduced by these approximations can be reduced below the statistical uncertainties of the calculation by taking @xmath40 sufficiently large and @xmath50 sufficiently small @xcite . for the small imaginary  time propagator",

    "those instants should be taken in the central part of @xmath60 , in such a way as to ensure complete projection onto the ground state , and to avoid any spurious dependence of @xmath61 on the trial wavefunction .",
    "the pigs method provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of ground  state properties and imaginary  time correlation functions for any choice of the trial wavefunction , provided that @xmath62 . the quality of the trial wavefunction , however , has a determining impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the calculation @xcite .",
    "shadow wavefunctions @xcite ( swfs ) take into account interparticle correlations by introducing auxiliary variables @xmath63 , called shadows , and coupling them with the real positions @xmath64 of the particles through a gaussian kernel : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 are jastrow wavefunction @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath4 k phase diagram of the 2d - sc bosons in the ( @xmath26,@xmath104 ) plane is characterized by a dome below which the stable phase is a solid , and above which it is a fluid . at fixed @xmath26 , and for @xmath104 in the vicinity of the transition ,",
    "the energies of the fluid and of the solid phase are very close and with a similar curvature .",
    "this fact is exemplified in figure  [ fig : eqstate ] , where we show the ground  state energy per particle for @xmath105 bosons at @xmath106 , and makes rather difficult to accurately locate the fluid - solid transition with the maxwell construction . as a consequence",
    "the phase diagram , sketched in figure  [ fig : punti_es ] , is known only with limited accuracy .",
    " , @xmath107 k).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the present work , we have simulated systems of @xmath108 2d - sc bosons at various reduced densities with the deboer parameter fixed to @xmath106 . as illustrated in figure [",
    "fig : punti_es ] , the investigation of diagonal , off  diagonal and dynamical properties has been performed at three different reduced densities @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . as the density increases , the crystallization of the system is approached . for each of the considered densities ,",
    "we have computed the static structure factor @xmath112 the radial distribution function @xmath113 , related to the static structure factor by @xmath114 and the off  diagonal one  body density matrix @xmath115 as well as the imaginary  time intermediate scattering function and the dynamical structure factor , which is the central observable of the present work . in the fluid phase @xmath116 is function of the distance @xmath117 and its fourier transform represents the momentum distribution .",
    "when @xmath118 does not vanish at large distance , there is a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and the quantity @xmath119 represents the fraction of particles in the bec .    ,",
    "@xmath5 and one  body density  matrix.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for @xmath106 the densities of the present study are in the normal region , in that the short  range order increases with the density .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : essediq ] : the oscillations of @xmath113 and the peak of @xmath120 increase and sharpen as the density increases .",

    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of hard ",
    "core systems like @xmath13he .    at the same time",
    "there is a displacement in the position of the peaks : the position @xmath121 of the first peak of @xmath113 decreases with increasing density , and the position @xmath122 of the main peak of @xmath120 increases for increasing density , as detailed in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "here we can notice a quantitative difference with respect to @xmath1he . for 2d - sc the position of the peak of @xmath120 increases by 45% as the density changes from 0.01 to 0.0225 and",
    "this displacement is very close to the square root of the ratio of those two densities .",
    "this means that the variation of the short  range order of the 2d - sc fluid corresponds closely to what one would expect from a simple compression of the positions of the particles . in the case of @xmath13he ,",
    "such displacements are much smaller .",
    "for instance , in 2d @xmath13he the freezing density is about 50% larger of the equilibrium density @xcite , so that a simple compression gives a @xmath123 displacement of the peaks of @xmath113 and @xmath120 .",
    "the actual displacements of these peaks for @xmath1he in 2d are instead only 8% , much smaller of the value resulting from compression .",
    "this difference between the two systems can be attributed to the different stiffness of the short  range repulsion of the two systems ( see inset in figure [ fig : eqstate ] ) . as discussed in the forthcoming section",
    ", this different density dependence of the short  range order has a dramatic effect on the density dependence of the excitation spectrum of soft  core particles , compared to hard  core particles .",

    "the prominent feature is the plateau at large distance , reflecting the emergence of bec .",
    "therefore the present system is superfluid .",
    "as expected @xmath124 decreases as the system becomes more strongly coupled , due to the increase in the density .",
    "in fact the condensate is 13.3% at @xmath125 , 4.7% at @xmath126 and 2.5% at @xmath127 .",
    "we remind that 100% of the particles are in the condensate in the limit of vanishing density .",
    "the trend of the condensate with density is similar to that observed in @xmath13he , both in 2d and 3d .",
    "for instance , the bec fraction of @xmath1he in 2d changes from 21% at equilibrium density to 3% at freezing .",
    "one might ask whether there is a general trend of the condensate fraction , as the system becomes increasingly coupled . to this purpose ,",
    "let us recall that a measure of the degree of local order is provided by the height @xmath128 of the first peak of @xmath120 . in figure  [ fig:5 ] , the condensate fraction @xmath124 is shown as function of @xmath128 for 2d - sc and for @xmath1he in 2d .",
    "it clearly emerges a surprising similarity in the behavior of @xmath124 for these two very different systems .",
    "once divided by the reduced density , @xmath129 starts from unity at @xmath3 and decays as a quadratic function of @xmath19 with curvature proportional to the kinetic energy . at intermediate distances , before reaching the long  distance bec plateau , @xmath129 has some weak damped oscillations , that are slightly stronger at larger density .",

    "this behavior has a simple explanation : when the maxon energy is larger than twice the roton energy @xmath153 , the maxon can decay in two rotons , and thus acquires a finite lifetime even at @xmath4 k @xcite . when there is overdamping @xmath135 has only a very broad peak as the remnant of the excitation . at @xmath52",

    "this is similar to @xmath1he where , close to the freezing density , the maxon gets a finite lifetime even at the lowest temperature of experiment @xcite . in 2d - sc system",

    "such behavior is so characteristic that often the roton excitation is considered as the soft mode of the solidification phase transition @xcite , the vanishing of @xmath153 being preempted by the first ",
    "order nature of the fluid  solid transition .",
    "our results show that the roton energy of the 2d - sc system is an _ increasing _ function of density as solidification is approached .",
    "this jeopardizes the notion of the roton as the soft - mode of the fluid - solid transition as a generic property of this quantum phase transition , and represents one of the main results of our computations .",
    "it is possible to understand the origin of the different density dependence of the roton energy in our soft ",
    "core system and in @xmath1he .",
    "consider the feynman spectrum of excitations in a bose fluid , @xmath157 we remind the first few sum rules of @xmath135 at @xmath4 k : @xmath158 the feynman spectrum ( [ eq:20 ] ) can be obtained from the first two sum rules in ( [ eq:21 ] ) under the assumption that @xmath135 is equal to a dirac delta function , i.e. @xmath159 .",
    "naturally , this is an approximation and the actual excitation spectrum in the roton region is well below the prediction of ( [ eq:20 ] ) which is also plotted in figure  [ fig:9 ] . the depression of @xmath153 below @xmath160 is a measure of many  body effects going under the name of backflow @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the density dependence of @xmath160 : @xmath141 is an increasing function of density , and the maximum of @xmath120 is an increasing function of the density .",

    ", @xmath141 depends weakly on @xmath156 and the increase of @xmath128 is considerable , so that the roton energy is a decreasing function of @xmath156 . in 2d - sc , @xmath161 has a stronger density dependence compared to @xmath1he , due to the softness of the repulsion at short range : the density dependence of the numerator in ( [ eq:20 ] ) is the dominant effect , whence the roton energy is an increasing function of @xmath104 . to this effect , one has to add the backflow contribution to the roton energy which is an increasing function of @xmath156 .",
    "the dependence of the roton energy on the density is thus determined by two competing effects , on which the details of the interatomic potential have a strong and non  trivial impact . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no general dependence of the roton energy on the density .",
    "one question one might ask is if the backflow effect on the roton energy depends on the nature of the interatomic potential or not . a measure of this backflow effect is @xmath162 and this quantity is plotted in figure  [ fig:5 ] as function of the height of the maximum of @xmath120 for @xmath1he in 2d and for 2d - sc .",
    "one can notice that the backflow effect on the roton energy increases with density in a similar way in these two systems .",
    "another quantity of interest in a many - body system is the density ",
    "density response function @xmath163 to a static external potential of wave  vector @xmath133",

    "@xmath163 is characterized by a large peak at a wave vector close to that of the maximum of @xmath120 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : chiq ] , the density  density response function @xmath163 of 2d - sc has a similar behavior .",
    "a simple estimate of @xmath163 is obtained from the feynman approximation @xcite : @xmath164 ^ 2\\ ] ] a measure of the many - body effects on @xmath163 is the ratio , @xmath165 , of the computed maximum @xmath166 of @xmath163 and of the maximum of @xmath167 .",

    "we have presented a study of static and dynamical properties at @xmath4 k of bosons interacting with the 2d screened coulomb potential along a constant value @xmath171 of the deboer parameter as function of density as the fluid approaches solidification . for the range of density of our",
    "study solidification takes place upon increasing density like in @xmath1he .",
    "one purpose of our study was to identify similarities and differences between a hard core system like @xmath1he and a soft core system like 2d - sc .",
    "we find that similarities between these two systems in 2d are indeed present but our results highlight also substantial differences .",
    "both systems have bec and are superfluid and the short range spatial order is an increasing function of density .",
    "however in 2d - sc the range of this order as measured , for instance , by the q - vector of the first peak of s(q ) has a much stronger density dependence compared to that of @xmath1he . on the basis of our powerful gift inversion method of the imaginary - time intermediate scattering function",
    "we are able to get a quantitative evaluation of the dynamical structure factor and of the spectrum @xmath137 of the excitations of the system .",
    "@xmath137 of 2d - sc has the typical phonon - maxon - roton structure as was suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "phonons and rotons are sharp excitations at all densities of our computation . unlike in the case of @xmath1he , maxons are well defined excitations only for density rather far from solidification . the most striking difference from @xmath1he",
    "is found in the density dependence of the roton energy @xmath153 . in @xmath1he @xmath153",
    "is strongly depressed by increasing density whereas in 2d - sc @xmath153 increases as @xmath156 approaches solidification .",
    "therefore the view @xcite of the roton as the soft mode of the fluid - solid transition can not be taken as a general description of the solidification transition of bosons .",
    "notwithstanding such differences , we find that it is possible to put into quantitative correspondence a number of properties of these two systems if such quantities are expressed in terms of the height @xmath128 of the first maximum of @xmath120 .",
    "we have verified this for the condensate , for the strength of the roton peak in @xmath135 and for the backflow contribution to the roton energy and to the maximum of the density  density response function .",
    "this last property is quite remarkable because one might have expected that backflow should be weaker in a soft core system like 2d - sc .",
    "our findings open a number of questions . at @xmath171 by increasing further the density one first finds the solid phase but this solid melts at still higher @xmath156 ( see fig .",
    "one question is what happens to the excitation spectrum at this inverted solidification transition , is there a kind of symmetry compared with the normal solidification at lower density or not ?",
    "another question is how this high density fluid evolves toward the 2d unscreened coulomb system in which @xcite phonons are replaced by plasmons and bec is suppressed to zero . above a critical value of @xmath26 solidification disappears and the system is fluid at all densities .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate how the dynamical properties evolve , presumably in a non - monotonic way as one moves from low density to very large @xmath156 .",
    "we have shown that some properties of 2d - sc and @xmath1he can be put into quantitative correspondence for states characterized by the same amount of short range order",
    ". it should be interesting to verify which is the degree of validity of such quasi - universality by changing the value of @xmath26 of 2d - sc and by studying other strongly interacting bosonic fluids in 2d , as well as an investigation of the possible validity of this law also for bosonic fluids in 3d .",
