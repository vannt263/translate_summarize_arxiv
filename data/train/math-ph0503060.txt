    "generalizations @xmath0 of hermite polynomials @xmath1 were recently @xcite proposed to describe , for instance , density perturbations constrained by a condition of matter conservation . because of the constraint , such polynomials can not form a complete set , but span a subspace well suited to specific applications .",
    "in particular , the polynomials @xmath0 used in @xcite were motivated by the consideration in nuclear physics of the hohenberg - kohn functional @xcite and similar functionals along the thomas - fermi method @xcite .",
    "indeed , in such approaches , the ground state of a quantum system is shown to be a functional of its density @xmath2 and there is a special connection between @xmath3 and the mean field @xmath4 driving the system .",
    "it was thus convenient to expand variations of @xmath5 in a basis @xmath6 of particle number conserving components , @xmath7 with the term - by - term constraint , @xmath8 this spares , in the formalism , the often cumbersome use of a lagrange multiplier .",
    "simultaneously , it was convenient to expand variations of @xmath9 in a basis orthogonal to the flat potential , because , trivially , a flat @xmath10 as just a change in energy reference , can not influence the density .",
    "the same basis can thus be used for @xmath11 since the very same condition , @xmath12 induces orthogonality to a constant @xmath13 because of the nuclear physics context of @xcite , harmonic oscillators shell models were considered and the basis contained a gaussian factor , @xmath14    the same functional approaches @xcite are also of a general use in atomic and molecular physics , where gaussian weights would be clumsy and radial properties are best fitted with simple exponential weights @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , the discussion was restricted to one dimensional problems . in the present note ,",
    "we want to include two and three dimensional situations .",
    "we shall thus use weights of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 but integrals will carry a factor @xmath17 with @xmath18 a positive exponent , suitable for dimension @xmath19 this will lead to generalizations of laguerre polynomials .    this note is also concerned with compact domains , of the form @xmath20 for instance .",
    "this might correspond for instance to expansions of density fluctuations in cylindrical vessels used for chemical processes , where mass conservation is also in order , or maybe in centrifuges .",
    "radial integrals with factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 in both the constraint and orthogonalization conditions will lead to generalizations of legendre polynomials .    for any positive weight @xmath23 and any dimension @xmath24 a constraint of vanishing average",
    ", @xmath25 is incompatible with a polynomial @xmath26 of order @xmath27 therefore , in the following , the order hierarchy for the constrained polynomials runs from @xmath28 to @xmath29 while that for the traditional polynomials runs from @xmath30 to @xmath31 we study in some generality the `` laguerre '' case in section ii . in turn , the `` legendre '' case is the subject of section iii .",
    "a brief section iv discusses possible applications to the study of density fluctuations in centrifuges .",
    "section v answers a question which was omitted in @xcite , that of the nature of the projector onto the subspace spanned by the constrained states and the nature of the codimension of this subspace .",
    "a numerical application is provided in section vi .",
    "a discussion and conclusion make section vii .",
    "in this section we consider basis states carrying a weight @xmath15 in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a polynomial .",
    "it is clear that @xmath34 can not be a finite , non vanishing constant if the constraint , @xmath35 must be implemented .",
    "hence set integer labels @xmath36 and @xmath37 and define polynomials @xmath33 by the conditions , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the usual kronecker symbol and the positive numbers @xmath40 are normalizations , to be defined later .",
    "it is elementary to generate such polynomials numerically , in two steps by brute force , namely i ) first create `` trivial seeds '' of the form , @xmath41 where the subtraction of the average , @xmath42 ensures that each trivial seed fulfills the constraint , then ii ) orthogonalize such seeds by a gram - schmidt algorithm .",
    "the first polynomials read ,    @xmath43    all these are defined to be `` monic '' , namely the coefficient of @xmath44 is always @xmath45 for an illustration we show in figure 1 the new polynomials @xmath46 and @xmath47 together with laguerre polynomial @xmath48 the same fig .",
    "1 also shows @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51    rather using the gram - schmidt method , we find it easier , and more elegant , to generate the polynomials @xmath52 starting from the initial table , eqs .",

    "\\i ) let us first create some kind of a `` less trivial seed '' at order @xmath55 assuming the polynomial @xmath56 is known .",
    "for this , try @xmath57 by partial integration , we see that , @xmath58 =    2 \\int_0^\\infty dr\\ e^{-\\frac{1}{2}r } \\left[r^d\\ , g_{n-1}^d(r)\\right ] ' \\ , , \\label{seedg}\\ ] ] where again a prime means derivation with respect to @xmath54 thus @xmath59 makes indeed a less trivial seed , compatible with the constraint . notice that the order @xmath60 of this seed polynomial @xmath61 comes from the term @xmath62 only , the other two terms having order @xmath63 notice again that , in the table , eqs . ( 2 ) , all polynomials @xmath33 are monic",
    ". we can define @xmath33 as monic , systematically . since the product @xmath62 respect this `` monicity '' , and since @xmath61 fulfills the constraint , we conclude that @xmath61 is a linear combination of @xmath52 with coefficient 1 , and of all the lower order polynomials @xmath64 with @xmath65 but with yet unknown coefficients .",
    "\\ii ) it turns out that such coefficients vanish if @xmath66 indeed , an integration of @xmath61 against @xmath64 weighted by @xmath67 gives , by partial integration of the @xmath68 term , @xmath69 \\ , g_m^d(r ) = \\nonumber \\\\ & \\int_0^{\\infty } dr\\ e^{-r}\\ , r^{d-1}\\ , g_{n-1}^d(r)\\ , ( r-2d)\\ , g_m^d(r ) + 2\\int_0^{\\infty } dr\\ g_{n-1}^d(r)\\ , \\left [ e^{-r}\\ , r^d\\ , g_m^d(r)\\right ] ' = \\nonumber \\\\ & \\int_0^{\\infty } dr\\ e^{-r}\\ , r^{d-1}\\ , g_{n-1}^d(r )   \\left[-\\sigma_{m+1}^d(r)-2d\\ , g_m^d(r)\\right ] .",

    "this integral , eq .",

    "( [ recurg ] ) .",
    "elementary manipulations also give , @xmath81 here , in the same way as a prime means first derivative with respect to @xmath82 we used double primes for second derivatives .",

    "legendre polynomials , and their associates and generalizations ( gegenbauer , chebyshev , jacobi ) are defined with respect to the @xmath84 $ ] segment .",
    "exceptionally in the literature , one finds shifted legendre polynomials , adjusted to the @xmath85 $ ] segment .",
    "we are here interested in applications to radial densities in cylinders , or the small circles of toruses , or spheres .",
    "hence we shall use @xmath86 it is clear that the case , @xmath87 does not make an original problem , since legendre polynomials , whether translated and/or scaled or not , already average to @xmath30 as soon as their order @xmath60 is @xmath88 we keep the case , @xmath87 for the sake only of completeness and in this section we consider @xmath89 with a geometry factor @xmath90 the weight is @xmath91 hence our states are described by just a polynomial @xmath92 of order @xmath93 it is again obvious that @xmath94 can not be a non vanishing constant if the constraint , @xmath95 is implemented .",
    "hence set @xmath96 @xmath97 and define polynomials @xmath92 from conditions , @xmath98 where the normalizations @xmath99 are again to be defined later .",
    "it is obvious that the shifted ( and shrunk ) legendre polynomials @xmath100 satisfy both constraint and orthogonality relations for @xmath87 because they are orthogonal to any constant polynomial , of order @xmath101 the polynomials @xmath102 thus make nothing new .",
    "we turn therefore to @xmath103 and @xmath104 with a brute force construction as in the previous section .",
    "but the defining conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ definl ] ) , show a difference with eqs .",
    "( [ definl ] ) : both orthogonality and constraint conditions now carry the same weight , namely @xmath105 while in the previous case , eqs .",
    "( [ definl ] ) , there were different weights , because of the exponentials @xmath106 and @xmath107 a similar difference between @xmath108 and @xmath109 happened in the `` hermite '' case , naturally .",

    "this new set of polynomials will depend on @xmath125 however , since @xmath21 is already scaled to a radius @xmath130 for the cylinder and thus @xmath122 can not be scaled away . because of this @xmath122 dependence we do not elaborate further on this issue . for a large list of _ ad hoc _ polynomials and integration weights , see @xcite .",
    "for the sake of the discussion and short notations , set first @xmath87 @xmath131 and temporarily include normalization to unity factors into both the laguerre polynomials @xmath132 and the constrained @xmath133 this summarizes as , @xmath134 ^ 2\\ , l_m(r)\\ , l_n(r)=\\delta_{mn},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\int_0^{\\infty } dr\\ [ \\mu(r)]^2\\ , g_m^1(r)\\ , g_n^1(r)=\\delta_{mn } , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",

    "obvious also is the limit , @xmath143 the role of the rank one @xmath144 difference @xmath145 is to subtract from any test state , @xmath146 that part which violates the condition of vanishing average .",
    "we shall show that the elementary ansatz , @xmath147 defines the proper `` subtractor '' operator @xmath148 indeed , from @xmath149 one obtains @xmath150 hence @xmath151 is the projector @xmath152 incidentally , the laguerre result for @xmath153 is very simple , because @xmath154 but the ansatz for @xmath155 eq.([ansatz ] ) , generalizes to all cases .",

    "2 and 3 show the shapes , in terms of @xmath82 of @xmath171 and @xmath172 respectively , when the projectors are made of the modified laguerre polynomials @xmath133 the build up of an approximate @xmath173-function when @xmath140 increases from @xmath174 ( short dashes ) to @xmath175 ( long ones ) and @xmath176 ( full lines ) is transparent , although the convergence is faster when peaks are closer to the origin , compare figs . 2 and 3 . the slower convergence in fig .",
    "3 is due to the cut - off imposed by exponential weights as long as @xmath140 is finite .",
    "given @xmath177 there is a `` box effect '' , the range of the box being of order @xmath178 a similar build up is observed for our other families of constrained polynomials , with slightly different details of minor importance such as , for instance , a box range @xmath179 for the hermite case .",
    "the box effect is even more transparent in figs . 4 and 5 , which show the shapes of subtractors @xmath180 and @xmath181 deduced from constrained polynomials of the laguerre ( fig .",
    "4 ) and hermite ( fig .",
    "5 ) type , respectively .",
    "( for graphical convenience , the polynomials @xmath182 and @xmath1 used for the hermite case , fig . 5 ,",
    "are tuned to a weight @xmath183 rather than @xmath184 but this detail is not critical . )",
    "it seems safe to predict that , given an effective length @xmath185 for the box , the wiggles of the subtractor will smooth out when @xmath186 and that only a background @xmath187 will then remain .",
    "we return here to the toy model discussed in @xcite and the corresponding , modified hermite polynomials .",
    "the model consists of z non interacting , spinless fermions , driven by a one dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath188 the ground state density from the @xmath189 lowest orbitals reads , @xmath190 ^ 2.$ ] let @xmath191 and @xmath192 label `` hole '' and `` particle '' orbitals , respectively . add a perturbation @xmath193 to the initial potential @xmath194 the first order variation of the density is , @xmath195 if we expand @xmath196 and @xmath197 in that basis @xmath198 provided by the new polynomials , the formula , eq .",
    "( [ prtrbg ] ) , becomes , @xmath199 where @xmath200 denotes both a particle - hole matrix element of a potential perturbation and the projection of a particle - hole product of orbitals upon the basis @xmath201 in @xcite we briefly studied the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this symmetric matrix , @xmath202 where @xmath203 is a short notation to account for the denominators and the particle - hole summation , and the tilde indicates transposition .",
    "it is clear that the invertible @xmath204 represents the functional derivative @xmath205 and is suited for _ infinitesimal _ perturbations .",
    "we shall now take advantage of the representation provided by @xmath206 to study _ finite _ trajectories @xmath207    for this , we consider a variable hamiltonian , @xmath208 made of the initial harmonic oscillator , but with a finite perturbation @xmath209 along one `` mode '' @xmath210 it is trivial to diagonalize @xmath211 with an excellent numerical accuracy and thus obtain , given @xmath212 the ground state density @xmath213 then it is trivial to expand the finite variation , @xmath214 in the basis @xmath201 this defines coordinates @xmath215 for trajectories , parametrized by the intensity of the chosen mode @xmath216 for @xmath217    in figures 7 and 8 we show , with @xmath218 results from @xmath219 and @xmath220 respectively .",
    "the case , @xmath221 makes almost a harmonic oscillator and is probably of academic interest only ; anyhow we verified that its confirms the results with @xmath222 and @xmath223 we use a basis @xmath206 containing a factor @xmath183 rather than @xmath224 to better match the same factor @xmath183 created by products of harmonic oscillator orbitals in the calculation of matrix elements @xmath225 but this technicality is not important for the physics .",
    "the main result to be observed seems to be the lack of `` collectivity '' for such modes and for such elementary hamiltonians .",
    "indeed , for @xmath226 the first five coordinates of @xmath227 read @xmath228 with a strong dominance of @xmath229 while for @xmath230 these read @xmath231 with a strong dominance of @xmath232 to clarify figs .",
    "7 and 8 , we had indeed to blow up each @xmath233 by a factor @xmath234 where @xmath216 is the index of the driver mode in potential space .",
    "other modes than @xmath235 and @xmath236 show the same property : in the density space , a trajectory driven by @xmath237 stays close to the same @xmath238 axis in that density space , although curvatures effects , while somewhat modest , are not absent .",
    "such non linearity , slight curvatures are seen in figs .",
    "7 - 8 , and also in figure 9 , where the three @xmath239 sets of data shown by fig . 7 are converted into a parametric plot for a trajectory . for graphical purposes",
    "again , @xmath240 and @xmath241 are blown up @xmath242 times to create fig .",
    "9 . it can be concluded , temporarily , that the `` flexibility '' matrix @xmath204 is not too far from being diagonal in the @xmath206 basis , or in other words , that the @xmath243 modes indicate an approximately natural hierarchy in both the potential and the density spaces .",
    "a subsidiary question pops up : that of the positivity of @xmath244 indeed , while the space of potentials is basically a linear space , with arbitrary signs for @xmath4 when the position @xmath21 changes , densities @xmath3 must remain positive for every @xmath54 this creates severe constraints for any linear parametrization of @xmath227 in terms of the basis @xmath245 in our toy model , it turns out that @xmath246 hence , if we truncate @xmath227 to have two components only , @xmath247 and @xmath248 for instance , then @xmath5 is the product of @xmath183 and a polynomial @xmath249 @xmath250 rescale out inessential factors , for a simpler polynomial , @xmath251 eliminate @xmath21 between @xmath252 and @xmath253 the resultant @xmath254 when it vanishes , gives the border of the convex domain of parameters @xmath255 where @xmath252 remains positive definite .",
    "this domain contains the origin , because of @xmath256 the precise form of @xmath257 is a little cumbersome and does not need to be published here .",
    "but the resulting border is shown in figure 10 .",
    "generalizations to more @xmath227 parameters are obvious , with more cumbersome resultants @xmath258",
    "the subject of orthogonal polynomials has been so treated and overtreated that any claim to novelty must contain much more than a change of the integration measure .",
    "we took therefore a different approach , motivated by a law of physics and/or chemistry , matter conservation .",
    "this means a constraint of a vanishing average for the states described by weighted polynomials .    for a support @xmath259 and a simple exponential weight such as @xmath15",
    "a non trivial generalization of laguerre polynomials occurs .",
    "this extends the generalization of hermite polynomials described in @xcite with the support @xmath260-\\infty,\\infty[$ ] and gaussian weights such as @xmath14    we also took care of cylindrical and spherical geometries , by replacing @xmath261 with @xmath262 and @xmath263 respectively .",
    "the new sets of constrained polynomials are clearly sensitive to the geometry .    for finite supports such as @xmath85 $ ] and constant weights ,",
    "the constraint is already satisfied by the usual brand of orthogonal polynomials as soon as their order is @xmath88 in that sense , we did not find significantly original generalizations of legendre polynomials , although we generated polynomials fitted to the cylindrical and spherical geometries .",
    "the cause of the failure is transparent : when the weight @xmath264 is a constant , there is no difference between the orthogonality metric @xmath108 and the constraint weight @xmath265    for each set of new polynomials we found a recursion relation and a differential equation .",
    "there seems to be a systematic property for those cases where the constraint generates truly original polynomials , namely when @xmath266 in such cases , recursion and differentiation seem to be necessarily entangled .",
    "this does not happen for traditional orthogonal polynomials , indeed , and this `` entanglement '' may deserve some future attention .",
    "constrained polynomials expressing matter conservation in centrifuges do make an original set if the fluid under centrifugation is compressible ; a non constant reference weight @xmath109 is indeed in order there .",
    "but the set depends on the precise form of @xmath109 via potentially many physical parameters .",
    "we found it difficult to design , through scaling , a sufficiently `` universal '' set .",
    "`` centrifuge polynomials '' will have to be calculated specifically for each practical situation .",
    "for those new polynomials generalizing the hermite and laguerre ones , we found a description of the subspace accounting for their defect of completeness . a codimension 1 is the consequence of the constraint , expressed at first by the obvious lack of a polynomial of order @xmath27    finally the use of such polynomials was illustrated by a toy model for the hohenberg - kohn functional .",
    "a slightly surprising result was found : our polynomials , those of low order at least , define potential perturbations which are reflected by density perturbations having almost the same shapes .",
    "this occurs despite the delocalization created by the kinetic energy operator , hints at short ranges in effective interactions and validates the localization spirit of the thomas - fermi method .",
    "whether such hints are good when the full zoology of the density functional is investigated is , obviously , an open question ; for a review of the richness of the functional , we refer to@xcite .",
    "if long range forces are active , a significant amount of delocalization between the `` potential cause '' and the `` density effect '' is not excluded .",
    "it would be interesting indeed to discover collective degrees of freedom in this connection between potential and density .",
    "in any case , our main conclusion may be that the new polynomials provide , for the context of matter conservation , a discrete and full set of modes and coordinates , hence a systematic and constructive representation of phenomena ."
