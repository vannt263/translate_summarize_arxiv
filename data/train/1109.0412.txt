    "the transport properties of the integrable one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( afm ) _ xxz _ chain model are attracting considerable attention because anomalous spin and heat transports have been predicted.@xcite rigorous predictions concern the _ heat _ transport of the model in the isotropic ( heisenberg ) case .",
    "it is known to be _",
    "ballistic _ as the consequence of integrability and fundamental conservation laws.@xcite this means , a _ divergent _ heat conductivity is expected .",
    "however , in experimental realizations of this model , the observable spinon heat conductivity @xmath2 always has to be finite since extrinsic scattering processes due to defects and phonons are inherent to all materials and mask the intrinsic behavior of a spin chain .",
    "nevertheless , a very large @xmath2 has been observed in a number of cuprates that realize @xmath0 spin chains.@xcite especially , the material @xmath3 is considered an excellent realization of the 1d - afm @xmath0 heisenberg model ( hm).@xcite for this material , we recently reported quasi ballistic spinon heat transport with mean - free paths @xmath4 m for samples of extraordinary purity.@xcite    recently , several theoretical studies focused on the consequences of disorder for transport in 1d systems with controversial results.@xcite experimental studies are scarce and , so far , only concern heat transport studies on the 1d - afm @xmath0 hm with site disorder ( diagonal disorder ) , which cuts the chain into finite segments and , thus , rather trivially leads accordingly to a suppression of transport.@xcite here , we study the more subtle _ bond disorder _ ( off - diagonal disorder ) , which leaves the chains in the material intact and which recently has been investigated in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments.@xcite we induce this subtle type of disorder in srcuo@xmath5 by systematically substituting isovalent ca for sr in tiny amounts .",
    "this off - chain lattice doping by small ca@xmath6 ions induces a local lattice distortion which must result in a modulation , i.e. , disorder , of the magnetic exchange constant @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to other doping schemes where the dopants occupy cu sites within the magnetic structures and , thus , generate site disorder,@xcite for this bond disorder , one generally expects only subtle changes in the magnetic transport properties of the system .",
    "in fact , previous studies show that the magnetic heat transport of the @xmath0 afm square lattice@xcite and the two - leg spin ladder systems,@xcite whose underlying spin models are non integrable , is unaffected by such kinds of disorder . radically different from these findings , in ca - doped srcuo@xmath5 , we observe a severe suppression of @xmath2 already at tiny doping levels ( @xmath8% ) .",
    "hence , these data suggest that the disorder - induced departure from integrability efficiently destroys the ballistic nature of heat transport in the 1d - afm @xmath0 hm . in the framework of a kinetic model ,",
    "we show that this suppression is captured by an effective spinon - impurity term in the spinon mean - free path , which surprisingly exhibits the same doping dependence as the long - distance decay length of the spin - spin correlation as determined by density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations .",
    "we have grown centimeter sized single crystals of sr@xmath9ca@xmath10cuo@xmath5 with @xmath11 , 0.0125 , 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.1 using the traveling - solvent floating zone method.@xcite as starting materials we used cuo ( 99.99% purity ) , srco@xmath12 ( 99% purity ) and caco@xmath12 ( 99% purity ) .",
    "additionally , crystals with x=0 , 0.0125 were grown with all starting powders of 4n ( 99.99% ) purity .",
    "the crystallinity and the doping profile were checked under polarized light and by energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "a structural refinement was performed for samples of srcuo@xmath5 and sr@xmath13ca@xmath14cuo@xmath5 in a single - crystal diffractometer . for the doped material ,",
    "this yielded a reduction in the cell volume by 1% with respect to the undoped compound in agreement with literature values.@xcite furthermore , we found a change in the cu - o - cu bond angle and the bond distance of roughly 0.3% .",
    "( 3.896  @xmath15 ) and 175.5 ( 174.9 ) , respectively , for @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) . ]",

    "local _ ca - induced variation in the lattice from density - functional calculations using the code quantum espresso.@xcite a @xmath17 supercell of srcuo@xmath5 doped with 10% ca was relaxed with minimal symmetry assumptions .",
    "this yielded a cu - o - cu bond length variation that is approximately the same as the doping induced change in the mean cu - o - cu distances measured with the single - crystal diffractometer .",
    "this consistency corroborates the presence of a bond disorder in the material . for the transport measurements , rectangular samples with typical dimensions of @xmath18 for measurements of the heat conductivity along the principal axes ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) were cut from the crystals for each doping level with an abrasive slurry wire saw .",

    "this is a result from quasi ballistic spinon heat transport in the chains.@xcite more specifically , the spinon heat conductivity @xmath2 , which dominates the total ( spinon plus phonon ) heat conductivity along the @xmath23 axis leads to a broad peak at low temperatures ( @xmath24 at @xmath25  k ) followed by a strong decrease toward a still significantly enhanced value ( @xmath26 ) at room temperature .    upon doping the material with ca , the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the spin chains ( @xmath19 ) is gradually suppressed .",
    "this is the typical expectation of increased scattering by phonons off defects .",
    "@xcite since the ca@xmath6 impurities possess a smaller ionic radius and mass as compared to sr@xmath6 , they act as defects for the phonons .. this gives very similar results apart from a small anisotropy , which is already present in the undoped compound and does not change in magnitude upon doping .",
    "] a much more dramatic change upon doping is observed in @xmath21 .",
    "already at the lowest doping level of 1.25%  ca , @xmath21 is suppressed strongly as compared to that of the pristine material , and the overall curve shape of @xmath27 is changed completely .",
    "the peak at low temperatures is now significantly smaller ( @xmath28 ) , is much sharper , and is shifted toward lower temperatures ( @xmath29k ) . at about 50k , @xmath21 shows a kink , above which , it decreases much weaker and approaches @xmath21 of the undoped compound for even higher temperatures . upon increasing the ca doping , the absolute value of the peak decreases , although its position stays constant .",
    "the kink is gradually shifted to higher temperatures , and all of the curves approach the curve of the undoped compound at room temperature .",
    "this apparent saturation behavior is most visible at 10%  ca doping , where a small maximum is followed by a practically constant thermal conductivity .",
    "nevertheless , the anisotropy between @xmath19 and @xmath21 is still considerable since at 300k , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . with 2n and 4n purity of 1.25%",
    "ca doping did not show any significant difference .",
    "therefore the results for 2.5% , 5% and 10%  ca doping were obtained using crystals of 2n purity . ]",
    "the strong suppression of @xmath21 implies that the ca impurities lead to a very strong suppression of the spinon heat conductivity @xmath2 already at very low doping levels ( @xmath32 ) because the doping scheme apparently only causes a moderate suppression of the phononic heat conductivity , as seen in @xmath19 .",
    "qualitatively , this suggests that the doping - induced bond disorder leads to a significant deviation in the spin system in sr@xmath9ca@xmath10cuo@xmath5 from the @xmath0 heisenberg chain model , and , thus effectively destroys the ballistic nature of the heat transport in the material .",
    "one might conjecture that the connected departure from integrability can be captured by an effective scattering process that describes the observed suppression of @xmath2 in our heat transport experiments . in order to investigate this notion further",

    "[ fig : kappa mag],width=321 ]      the first step of such an analysis  @xcite consists in estimating the phononic part of @xmath21 via @xmath34 .",
    "then , the spinon thermal conductivity is given by @xmath35   and @xmath20 of @xmath36 compared to the overall anisotropy of more than a factor of 5 between @xmath21 and @xmath19 , the validity of this method seems to be justified . ] .",
    "the doping - dependent evolution of @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa mag ] . at low temperatures ,",
    "@xmath2 of the undoped compound shows a large maximum ( @xmath37 at @xmath38k ) , which is followed by a steep decrease upon approaching room temperature where the values of the curve nearly become constant ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "doping of 1.25%  ca leads to a severe suppression of @xmath2 at low temperatures with a broadening of the maximum ( @xmath40 ) and a shift to 69k .",
    "up to room temperature , the curve approaches that of the undoped compound . further increasing the doping continues to decrease @xmath2 at low temperatures and shifts the increasingly broadened maximum to even higher temperatures . for temperatures @xmath41k , the values of @xmath2",
    "approach those of the undoped compound but remain smaller .     of sr@xmath9ca@xmath10cuo@xmath5 for different levels of doping . toward low temperatures , the error in the estimation of @xmath2 increases due to an increase in @xmath42 .",

    ", @xmath46 decreases strongly with increasing temperature which is the signature of spinon - phonon scattering.@xcite however , upon increasing the doping level , @xmath33 exhibits a systematic reduction , and the overall temperature - dependent change at a given doping level becomes less pronounced , suggesting an increased importance of spinon - defect scattering.@xcite we test this notion by applying matthiesen s rule and decomposing @xmath33 into two respective contributions , i.e. , @xmath47 . here , @xmath43 accounts for temperature - independent spinon - defect scattering ,",
    "whereas , @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath22-dependent spinon - phonon scattering . by using @xmath49 with a characteristic phonon energy scale @xmath50 on the order of the debye temperature,@xcite we have @xmath51 with a proportionality constant @xmath52 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : umklapp ] ) is used to fit the @xmath33 data in fig .",
    "[ fig : l mag ] , where @xmath50 first was determined for the pure compound and then was used as a constant when fitting the data for finite - doping levels . as can be seen in fig .",

    "with different @xmath53 . ]",
    "a remarkable result is that @xmath52 also is constant nearly for all doping levels with a root - mean - square deviation of around 10% of the arithmetic mean value .",
    "thus , the effect of the bond disorder induced by the ca doping is described well by only one doping - dependent parameter that describes the spinon - defect scattering @xmath43 and one temperature - dependent spinon - phonon scattering mechanism , which is independent of doping .",
    "alternatively , for the afore discussed scattering , one might try to attribute the suppressed @xmath2 to a disorder - induced depletion of thermally excited quasiparticles .",
    "in fact , recent nmr measurements provided evidence for a spin gap @xmath54  k for 10% ca doping.@xcite however , the large @xmath7 makes the effect of this gap on the transport tiny . to illustrate the negligible influence , the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa mag ] shows an estimate of the impact of a spin gap@xcite on @xmath2 at 10% ca doping .     and @xmath55 as a function of doping @xmath56 ( bottom axis ) and disorder parameter @xmath57 ( top axis ) , respectively .",
    "the quantities are fitted by @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",

    ", @xmath43 decreases systematically with doping , following @xmath58 , with the scattering strength @xmath62 and the offset @xmath63 .",
    "note that , while @xmath64 is consistent with previous findings for spin - defect doped chains , two - leg spin ladders and 2d square lattices,@xcite the finding of a finite offset @xmath63 is rather unexpected .",
    "qualitatively , such a finite offset means that the effect of the bond disorder , in terms of defect like scattering , is strong at very small degrees of disorder but becomes increasingly unimportant at larger degrees of disorder .",
    "hence , the effect of the bond disorder is significantly different from that of strong site defects ( diagonal disorder ) , which cut the chains into finite segments.@xcite      in order to obtain deeper insight into the effect of bond disorder on the spin dynamics of the system , we investigated its influence on the spin - spin correlation as a function of the distance  @xmath65 .",
    "the model hamiltonian is written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a spin-@xmath68 operator at site @xmath69 , @xmath7 is the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction without bond disorder , @xmath70 is defined by a box probability distribution @xmath71 with the step function @xmath72 , and the disorder strength is controlled by @xmath57 .",

    "the spin - spin correlation follows a @xmath78 law , which is expected in the ballistic case . for @xmath79",
    "the long - distance part can be fitted just by @xmath80 , with the free parameter @xmath55 . since the commutator of the heat current operator and the spin chain hamiltonian is no longer zero for @xmath79 , ballistic heat transport no longer",
    "is expected . if one interprets the deviation in the spin - spin correlation from the algebraic decay ( @xmath78 ) as a measure for the departure of the system from the clean one ( i.e. from integrability ) , the argument of the fitted exponential may fix the crossover , with @xmath81 being ballistic and @xmath82 being diffusive . plotting @xmath55 as a function of @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : l0(x ) vs. xi(d ) ] ) strikingly reveals that @xmath55 depends in the same manner on @xmath57 as @xmath43 does on @xmath56 .",
    "note , in particular , that the calculated offset quantitatively almost perfectly matches that of the experiment , i.e. , @xmath83 in the strong disorder or large doping limit .",
    "furthermore , one may apparently assume @xmath84 .",
    "hence , in the frame of this simple model , the long - distance decay length @xmath55 of the spin - spin correlation can be interpreted as a limit for the effective spinon - defect scattering length @xmath43 .",
    "in conclusion , the doping - induced bond disorder in sr@xmath9ca@xmath10cuo@xmath5 causes a severe suppression of the spinon heat conductivity which is consistent with a disorder - induced departure of the underlying spin model from integrability and , thus , the destruction of ballistic heat transport .",
