    "coarse , or large - scale , geometry has long been studied in various guises , but most notably in the context of metric spaces .",
    "most generically , a _ coarse space _ is a space together with some kind of large - scale structure ( e.g. , a metric modulo _ quasi - isometry _ ; see remark  [ rmk : lslip - qisom ] ) .",
    "a _ coarse map _ between coarse spaces is then a map which respects this structure ( e.g. , a large - scale lipschitz map ) .",
    "since the small - scale ( i.e. , the topology ) is ignored , one can typically take coarse spaces to be _ discrete _ , replacing any nondiscrete space by some `` coarsely dense '' subset .",
    "in recent decades , coarse ideas have played an important role in the study of infinite discrete groups using the methods of geometric group theory , especially in the work of gromov and his followers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most basic example here is that if @xmath5 is a finitely generated group , then the word length metric on @xmath5 is modulo quasi - isometry independent of the finite set of generators used in defining it .",
    "coarse ideas have also arisen in geometric topology , and more specifically controlled topology which primarily concerns itself with problems on the structure of manifolds .",
    "( we refer the reader to @xcite*ch .  9 for a survey of the topic and for references . ) in this setting , one is interested in `` operations '' ( e.g. , homotopies , surgeries ) on spaces which respect some large - scale structure , i.e. , are _ controlled_. as before , one may take the large - scale structure to be given by a metric ( i.e. , _ bounded control _ ) .",
    "however , it is often more convenient to work with a coarser large - scale structure which is defined in purely topological terms ( i.e. , _ continuous control _ ; see  [ subsect : cts - ctl ] ) .",
    "controlled topology parallels the more classical theory for compact manifolds which relies on the use of algebraic invariants ( e.g. , algebraic @xmath2-theory ) . in controlled topology ,",
    "one gets controlled versions of those invariants ( in , e.g. , _ bounded _ and _ continuously controlled @xmath2-theory _",
    "@xcite ; see also @xcite ) . by considering the fundamental group of a space , a key object of study in the study of homotopy invariants ( e.g. , the novikov conjecture on higher signatures ) , many of the problems of geometric topology are related back to geometric group theory .",
    "on the analytic side , to any coarse space @xmath6 , roe has associated a @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 ( the _ roe algebra _ of @xmath6 ) , as well as various `` ( co)homology '' groups , e.g. , _ coarse @xmath2-homology _ @xmath7 . ( for a good overview of this and the following , see @xcite . ) on the other hand , one can also take the @xmath2-theory of @xmath1 ; the coarse baum ",
    "connes conjecture is that a certain assembly map @xmath8 is an isomorphism , at least for suitably nice @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath2-theory of roe algebras arises in the index theory of elliptic operators on noncompact manifolds ( on compact manifolds , the roe algebra is just the compact operators and the results specialize to classical index theory ) . indeed , historically it was the study of index theory on noncompact manifolds which led roe to coarse geometry ( see @xcite ) , and not the other way around . in this way ,",
    "the analytic approaches to the novikov conjecture ( starting with the work of lusztig @xcite ) are again related to coarse geometry .",
    "( see @xcite for a nice survey of the different approaches to the novikov conjecture . )",
    "after originally developing coarse geometry in the metric context @xcite , roe ( and his collaborators ) realized that one can define an abstract notion of _ coarse space _ , just as in small - scale geometry one has abstract _",
    "topological spaces_. just as the passage from metric space to topological space forgets large - scale ( metric ) information , the passage from metric space to coarse space should forget small - scale information .",
    "but an abstract coarse space retains enough structure to perform the large - scale constructions which were previously done in the metric context ( e.g. , construct the roe algebras , coarse @xmath2-homology , etc . ) .",
    "a _ coarse space _ is a set @xmath6 together with a _ coarse structure _ , which is a collection @xmath9 of subsets of @xmath10 ( called the _",
    "entourages _ of @xmath6 ) satisfying various axioms . when @xmath6 is a ( proper ) metric space , @xmath9 consists of the subsets @xmath11 such that @xmath12 a subset @xmath13 is _ bounded _ if and only if @xmath14 is an entourage of @xmath6",
    "; when @xmath6 is a metric space , @xmath2 is bounded if and only if it is metrically bounded .",
    "if @xmath6 is a discrete set , one typically axiomatically insists that the bounded subsets of @xmath6 be finite ( we call this the _ properness axiom _ ; see definition  [ def : prop - ax ] ) ; more generally , if @xmath6 is a topological space , the bounded subsets are required to be compact .    a set map @xmath15 is a _ coarse map _ if @xmath16 is _ proper _ in the sense that the inverse image of any bounded subset of @xmath6 is a bounded subset of @xmath17 and if @xmath16 _ preserves entourages _ in the sense that @xmath18 is an entourage of @xmath6 . in the metric case , @xmath16 is a coarse map if it is metrically proper and `` nonexpansive '' .",
    "there is an obvious notion of closeness for maps into a metric space : maps @xmath19 are _ close _ if @xmath20 this generalizes to the case when @xmath6 is a general coarse space : @xmath16 , @xmath21 are close if @xmath22 is an entourage of @xmath6 , where @xmath23 is the diagonal set @xmath24 .",
    "roe s _ coarse category _ has coarse spaces as objects , and closeness classes of coarse maps as morphisms .",
    "( a coarse map is a _ coarse equivalence _ if it represents an isomorphism in the coarse category . )",
    "coarse invariants are defined on this category , either as functions on the isomorphism classes of the coarse category ( e.g. , _",
    "asymptotic dimension _ ) or as functors from the coarse category to some other category ( e.g. ,",
    "_ coarse @xmath2-homology _ ) .",
    "though coarse invariants are the primary object of study in coarse geometry , the coarse category is rarely analyzed directly , and there is some confusion in the literature about what the coarse category is ( some authors take its arrows to be actual coarse maps ; we will call this the _ precoarse category _ ) .",
    "there is an obvious `` product coarse structure '' on the cartesian ( set ) product @xmath25 .",
    "the entourages are exactly the subsets of @xmath26 which project to entourages of @xmath6 and @xmath17 in the obvious way",
    ". however , this is not ( usually ) a product in the coarse category : the projection maps are not proper , unless both @xmath6 and @xmath17 are finite / compact .",
    "this problem already arises in the category of proper metric spaces and proper maps ( modulo closeness ) .",
    "the above does _ not _ prove that @xmath6 and @xmath17 do not have a product in the coarse category .",
    "certain products ( of infinite / noncompact coarse spaces ) _ do _ exist in the coarse category ; indeed , there is an infinite space @xmath6 ( namely the continuously controlled ray , or equivalently a countable set equipped with the _ terminal _ ,",
    "i.e. , `` indiscrete '' , coarse structure ) such that the product of @xmath6 with every countable coarse space exists ( remark  [ rmk : term - unital - prod ] ) .",
    "the above does not even prove that the `` product coarse space '' @xmath25 , as defined above , is not a product of @xmath6 and @xmath17 if equipped with suitable maps @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( not the set projections ) .",
    "metric spaces always yield _ unital _ coarse spaces , i.e. , coarse spaces @xmath6 such that @xmath29 is an entourage .",
    "though roe defines nonunital coarse spaces , unitality is usually a standing assumption , presumably since nonunital coarse spaces have no obvious use .    _",
    "the _ major innovation of this paper is the following : we relax the requirement that coarse maps be proper , to a requirement that we call _ locally properness_. local properness is not new : it is actually included in bartels s definition of `` coarse map '' @xcite*def .  3.3 .",
    "when the domain is a unital coarse space , local properness is equivalent to ( `` global '' ) properness ( corollary  [ cor : loc - prop - uni ] ) .",
    "however , when the domain is nonunital , we get many more coarse maps . consequently",
    ", using nonunital coarse spaces , it becomes extremely easy to construct ( nonzero ) categorical products in the coarse category .",
    "indeed , we can do much more .",
    "suppose @xmath30 is a ( closed ) subspace of a proper metric space @xmath6 , so that @xmath30 is itself a coarse space .",
    "there is an obvious _ ideal _ @xmath31 of @xmath9 generated by @xmath32 ( see definition  [ def : ideal ] )",
    ". the coarse space @xmath33 with underlying set @xmath6 and coarse structure @xmath34 is nonunital , unless @xmath30 is `` coarsely dense '' in @xmath6 .",
    "define a ( set ) map @xmath35 which sends each @xmath36 to a point @xmath37 in @xmath30 closest to @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 is usually not proper , hence is not coarse as a map @xmath40 .",
    "however , it _ is _ locally proper and coarse ( in our generalized sense ) as a map @xmath41 , and is actually a coarse equivalence .",
    "( we leave it to the reader to verify this , after locating the required definitions . )    for simplicity as well as for philosophical reasons , we only consider _ discrete _ coarse spaces ; hence for us a map is ( globally ) proper if and only if the inverse image of any point is a finite set .",
    "if a map @xmath42 between coarse spaces is proper , then @xmath43 is a proper map , and hence the restriction of @xmath43 to any entourage @xmath44 of @xmath17 is proper .",
    "we take the latter as the definition of local properness : a map @xmath15 between coarse spaces ( not necessarily unital ) is _ locally proper _ if , for all entourages @xmath45 of @xmath17 , the restriction @xmath46 is a proper map .",
    "there are a number of equivalent ways of defining local properness , the most intuitive of which is the following . for a nonunital coarse space",
    ", there is an obvious notion of _ unital subspace _ ; a map is locally proper if and only if the restriction to every unital subspace of its domain is a proper map ( corollary  [ cor : loc - prop - uni ] ) .",
    "when @xmath6 is nonunital , we must modify the the definition of closeness , lest the identity map on @xmath6 not be close to itself .",
    "we modify it in a simple way , now requiring that the domain also be a coarse space : coarse maps @xmath47 ( between possibly nonunital coarse spaces ) are _ close _ if @xmath48 is an entourage of @xmath6 for every entourage @xmath45 of @xmath17 . after checking the usual things , we get our nonunital _ coarse category _ , whose objects are ( possibly nonunital ) coarse spaces and whose arrows are closeness classes of ( locally proper ) coarse maps .",
    "meyer have defined a notion of _",
    "@xmath4-coarse spaces _ , coarse maps between such spaces , and an appropriate notion of closeness @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4-coarse space is just the colimit of an increasing sequence of unital coarse spaces .",
    "in fact , we show that the ( pre)coarse category of discrete @xmath4-coarse spaces is equivalent to a subcategory of our ( pre)coarse category consisting of the _ @xmath4-unital coarse spaces _",
    "( we do not examine the situation when one allows @xmath4-coarse spaces to have nontrivial topologies ) .",
    "let us see how to construct the product of coarse spaces @xmath6 and @xmath17 in this category .",
    "we do so by putting a _ nonunital _ coarse structure on the set @xmath49 .",
    "the entourages of the _ coarse product _",
    "@xmath25 are the @xmath50 such that :    1 .",
    "the restricted projections @xmath51 are proper maps ( this is the aforementioned properness axiom ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are proper maps ; and 3 .",
    "@xmath54 is an entourage of @xmath6 and @xmath55 is an entourage of @xmath17 .",
    "one can then check that this is a product in our nonunital coarse category ( indeed , it is a product in our nonunital _ precoarse category _ ) .",
    "we must emphasize that the coarse structure on the set product is crucial : if @xmath56 is a one - point coarse space , then @xmath57 as a set , but unless @xmath6 is bounded the coarse product @xmath58 is _ not _ coarsely equivalent to @xmath6 .",
    "the above construction generalizes to all nonzero products ( by nonzero product , we mean a product of a nonempty collection of spaces ) , including infinite products ( theorem  [ thm : pcrs - lim ] and proposition  [ prop : crs - prod ] ) .",
    "we will then proceed to examine equalizers in the nonunital coarse category , and discover that it has all equalizers of pairs of maps ( proposition  [ prop : crs - equal ] ) .",
    "a standard categorical corollary is that the nonunital coarse category has all nonzero ( projective ) limits ( theorem  [ thm : crs - lim ] ) .",
    "one can similarly analyze coproducts ( i.e. , sums or `` disjoint unions '' ) and coequalizers , and get that the nonunital coarse category has all colimits , i.e. , inductive limits ( theorem  [ thm : crs - colim ] ) .      for set theoretic reasons",
    ", the coarse category does not have a terminal object .",
    "( as we shall see in  [ subsect : rest - crs ] , one way of obtaining a terminal object is to restrict the cardinality of coarse spaces , though there is a better way to proceed .",
    "for most purposes , no such restriction is needed . )",
    "however , there is a plethora of coarse spaces which behave like terminal objects .",
    "the _ terminal coarse structure _ on a set @xmath6 consists of the subsets of @xmath59 which are both `` row- and column - finite '' ; denote the resulting coarse space by @xmath60 .",
    "a rather underappreciated fact about such coarse spaces is that , for any coarse space @xmath17 , _ all _ coarse maps",
    "latexmath:[$y \\to     of this is that , assuming that any such coarse map exists , the product of @xmath60 and @xmath17 in the ( unital or nonunital ) coarse category is just @xmath17 itself ( proposition  [ prop : term - id ] ) .    in the unital coarse category",
    ", @xmath62 is a functor . in the nonunital coarse category",
    ", one must replace @xmath60 with a different coarse space , denoted @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 for @xmath6 unital ) , to obtain a functor . in an abelian category ,",
    "one can define a quotient @xmath65 ( for @xmath15 ) as push - out @xmath66 .",
    "this generalizes to any category with zero objects and push - out squares .",
    "we will see that in fact we can generalize this to the coarse setting , defining @xmath67(y)$ ] to be the push - out @xmath68 in the ( nonunital ) coarse category .",
    "( indeed , one can do the same in the category of topological spaces , noting that there are two cases : `` @xmath63 '' is a one - point space if @xmath69 and the empty space otherwise . )",
    "our development of coarse geometry is a strict generalization of roe s , despite our assumption of discreteness ( see  [ sect : top - crs ] ) .",
    "most of the standard constructions in roe s coarse geometry ( such as those mentioned above ) generalize easily to our nonunital , locally proper version .",
    "( note , however , that our theory does not encompass what one may call , following the language of @xcite*ch .",
    "12 , the `` uniform category '' in which both the coarse structure and the topology are important .",
    "for example , roe s @xmath0-algebras @xmath70 , which are functorial for uniform maps , require a notion of _ topological coarse space_. we defer this task to @xcite ; see remark  [ rmk : top - crs - sp ] . )",
    "however , we will refrain from fully developing these applications in this paper . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we briefly examine some things enabled by our generalization .",
    "having examined the coarse category from the categorical point of view , many standard constructions from topology transfer easily over to the coarse setting .",
    "for example , one obtains a notion of coarse simplicial complex .",
    "of course , it is easy to deal with finite complexes explicitly in the unital coarse category .",
    "however , one result of having _ all _ colimits , including infinite ones , is that we actually obtain infinite coarse simplicial complexes .",
    "this should enable one to apply simplicial methods in coarse geometry .",
    "the framework and terminology we use are essentially due to roe and his collaborators ( see @xcite , in particular ) .",
    "since our development differs in various details and in the crucial concept of local properness , and for the sake of completeness , we provide a complete exposition from basic principles ; other , more standard , expositions include @xcite . in the basics",
    ", we do not claim much originality and most of the results will be known to those familiar with coarse geometry . however , in the context of locally proper maps , we have found certain methods of proof ( in particular , the use of proposition  [ prop : prop ] ) to be particularly effective , and have emphasized the use of these methods .",
    "thus our proofs of standard results may differ from the usual proofs .",
    "we have endeavoured to provide reasonably thorough references .",
    "however , it is often unwieldy to provide complete data for things which have been generalized and refined over the years . in such cases , rather than providing references to the original definition and all the subsequent generalizations",
    ", we simply reference a work ( often expository in nature ) which provides the current standard definition ; often , such definitions can be found in a number of places , such as the aforementioned standard expositions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized into five ( very unequal ) sections :     [ sect : crs - geom ] : :    we define our basic framework of coarse structures , coarse spaces , and    coarse maps , together with important results on local properness , and    push - forward and pull - back coarse structures .

    "similarly , it has all coproducts and all    coequalizers , hence all colimits .",

    "we    characterize the monic arrows of @xmath3 and show that    @xmath3 has categorical images , and dually we do the    same for epi arrows and coimages .",
