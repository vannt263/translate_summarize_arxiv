    "the program of exploring short - range nucleon structure and strong interaction dynamics with high  energy lepton scattering relies on measurements on the neutron as much as those on the proton target .",
    "neutron and proton data are needed to separate the isoscalar and isovector combinations of the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions , which are subject to different short  distance dynamics ( qcd evolution , higher  twist effects , small@xmath2 behavior ) and give access to different combinations of the parton densities ( gluons and singlet quarks vs.  non - singlet quarks ) .",
    "the unpolarized isovector structure function @xmath3 constrains the flavor composition of the nucleon s sea quark densities and permits study of small@xmath2 dynamics in the non - singlet sector . in the polarized case",
    "the isovector structure function @xmath4 can be used to cleanly separate leading  twist and higher  twist dynamics , taking advantage of its simple qcd evolution ( no mixing with gluons ) .",
    "the isoscalar combination @xmath5 can then be used to extract the polarized gluon density from the leading  twist qcd evolution .",
    "both isospin combinations are needed to determine the flavor decomposition of the polarized quark densities and their contributions to the nucleon spin .",
    "neutron and proton data combined are needed also to investigate the dynamical mechanism causing single ",
    "spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive dis ( where there are hints of surprisingly large isovector structures ) and to constrain the generalized parton distributions in deeply  virtual compton scattering",
    ".    neutron structure is measured in high  energy scattering experiments with nuclear targets .",
    "the extraction of the free neutron structure functions from nuclear dis data faces considerable challenges ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "nuclear binding modifies the apparent neutron structure functions through the fermi motion and other dynamical effects . at moderate momentum transfers",
    "@xmath6 the nuclear cross sections are affected by final  state interactions involving other nucleons . at @xmath0",
    "the large coherence length of the electromagnetic probe causes quantum  mechanical interference of the amplitudes for scattering from different nucleons along its path , which results in shadowing and antishadowing effects in the cross section @xcite .",
    "in polarized measurements with light nuclei ( deuteron @xmath7h , @xmath8he ) there is significant dilution from scattering on the proton(s ) .",
    "one must know not only the degree of neutron polarization in the nucleus but also the spin dependence of the various nuclear modifications of nucleon structure .",
    "attempts to account for these nuclear effects theoretically are complicated by the fact that they arise as an average over different classes of configurations in the nuclear wave function , which can not be separated in inclusive measurements .",
    "it is clear that better experimental control of the nuclear environment is needed to improve the precision of neutron structure extraction .",
    "this is particularly relevant if a combination of neutron and proton data are to be used to study subtle qcd effects , such as the separation of leading and higher twist , non - singlet qcd evolution , and non - singlet small@xmath2 behavior .",
    "inclusive deep  inelastic scattering from nuclei was measured in fixed ",
    "target experiments with electron and muon beams , at electron  nucleon squared center  of  mass energies @xmath9 in the range @xmath10 ( jlab 6 gev , desy hermes , slac , cern emc / nmc , fnal e665 ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review of the data ) .",
    "measurements of neutron spin structure with polarized nuclear targets were performed at slac , desy hermes , cern smc / compass and jlab 6 gev @xcite .",
    "both unpolarized and polarized nuclear measurements will be extended with the jlab 12 gev upgrade @xcite .",
    "while these experiments have provided basic information on neutron structure at @xmath11 , addressing the above questions will require data of much higher precision and wider kinematic coverage .",
    "the electron  ion collider ( eic ) , proposed as a next - generation facility for nuclear physics , would dramatically expand the opportunities for high - energy scattering on polarized light nuclei ( @xmath12 , @xmath8he ,  ) and measurements of neutron structure .",
    "the medium ",
    "energy eic designs recently developed provide electron  nucleon squared center  of  mass energies in the range @xmath13 at luminosities up to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the wide kinematic coverage would permit definitive studies of the @xmath15 evolution and small@xmath2 behavior of structure functions ; the high luminosity would enable measurements of spin asymmetries and rare processes involving exceptional configurations .",
    "even more important , two specific capabilities provided by the eic would allow one to control the nuclear modifications and extract neutron structure with unprecedented precision .",
    "one capability are deuteron beams , especially polarized deuterons , as would be available for the first time with the jlab meic , thanks to the figure8 shape of the ion ring designed to compensate the effect of spin precession @xcite .",
    "the deuteron is the simplest nucleus ( @xmath16 ) ; its wave function is known well up to large nucleon momenta @xmath17 300 mev , including the light - front wave function describing microscopic nuclear structure as probed in high - energy scattering processes @xcite .",
    "the deuteron has spin 1 and is mostly in the @xmath18 configuration ( s  wave ) , with a small admixture of @xmath19 ( d  wave ) , such that the proton and neutron are spin  polarized and their degree of polarization is known very well . because there are only two nucleons the possibilities for final  state interactions are limited ;",
    "in the configurations where they can happen they can be estimated using theoretical models ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for a model in the resonance region @xmath20 few gev ) .",
    "the other capability is the detection of spectator nucleons emerging from the high  energy scattering process ( `` spectator tagging '' ) . in collider experiments",
    "the spectator nucleons carry a fraction @xmath21 of the ion beam momentum and can be detected with appropriate forward detectors .",
    "the technique is uniquely suited to colliders : there is no target material absorbing low - momentum nucleons , and it can be used with polarized ion beams ( longitudinal and transverse ) .",
    "spectator tagging is especially powerful in scattering on the deuteron .",
    "it allows one to positively identify the active neutron through proton tagging , and to control its quantum state through measurement of the recoil momentum .",
    "spectator proton tagging with unpolarized deuterium was explored in a pioneering fixed - target experiment at jlab with 6 gev beam energy ( clas bonus detector , covers recoil momenta @xmath22 ) @xcite and will be studied further at 11  gev .    in this note",
    "we summarize the potential of dis on the deuteron with spectator proton tagging for precision measurements of the neutron structure functions at eic .",
    "we describe the method for eliminating nuclear structure effects through on - shell extrapolation in the spectator proton momentum , present simulations of unpolarized and polarized observables @xcite , and outline the accelerator and detector requirements .",
    "it should be noted that the various nuclear modifications of the nucleon s partonic structure are interesting physics topics in their own right ( with connections to short - range @xmath23 correlations , non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , etc . ) and can be studied with the same spectator tagging measurements at larger recoil momenta @xcite .",
    "the basic method for extracting the free neutron structure function with spectator tagging is described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : neutron ] ) .",
    "one measures the cross section of conditional dis @xmath24 as a function of the recoil proton momentum , parametrized by the light ",
    "cone fraction @xmath25 and the transverse momentum @xmath26 , defined in a frame where the deuteron momentum @xmath27 and the @xmath28 vector are collinear and along the @xmath29direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : neutron]a ) .",
    "a key variable is the invariant 4momentum transfer between the deuteron and the recoil proton , @xmath30 , calculated from @xmath31 and @xmath26 . as a function of @xmath32",
    "the scattering amplitude has a pole at @xmath33 , which arises from the impulse approximation diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron]b and corresponds to `` neutron exchange '' in the @xmath32channel .",
    "the residue at the pole is , up to a constant factor representing deuteron structure , given by the structure function of the _ free neutron , _ evaluated at the argument @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the scaling variable with @xmath36 . , and @xmath37 coincides with the usual scaling variable for scattering from a free nucleon . ]",
    "it can be shown that nuclear binding and final  state interactions only affect the amplitude at @xmath38 , but not the residue at the pole @xcite .    to extract the free neutron structure function one plots the measured tagged cross section as a function of @xmath32 , removes the pole factor @xmath39 , and extrapolates to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the pole in @xmath32 is extremely close to the physical region , so that the extrapolation can be performed with great accuracy ; the minimum physical value of @xmath41 is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the deuteron binding energy .",
    "the method is analogous to the chew ",
    "low extrapolation used to extract pion structure from @xmath44 scattering data .",
    "figure  [ fig : neutron]c shows a simulated on - shell extrapolation with meic pseudodata ( @xmath45 , integrated luminosity @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "one sees that the @xmath32dependence is very smooth .",
    "the extrapolation in @xmath32 is performed at _ fixed _ values of the recoil light - cone fraction @xmath31 , such that the effective @xmath47 in the neutron structure function remains constant along the way .",
    "figure  [ fig : neutron]c shows the pseudodata in three bins of @xmath31 with average values @xmath48 and a width of @xmath49 .",
    "note that the kinematic limit in @xmath41 increases from @xmath42 as @xmath31 moves away from unity .",
    "comparison of the extrapolation results at different @xmath31 allows one to confirm the universality of the nucleon pole and provided an important test of the theoretical framework .",
    "critical to the success of the method is the ability to measure the recoil proton momentum with complete coverage down to @xmath50 , and with a resolution @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the method described here permits a clean and model - independent extraction of free neutron structure and would enable precision measurements of @xmath53 over the entire @xmath2@xmath15 range accessible with eic . combined with proton data taken in the same kinematics",
    "it would determine the isovector structure function @xmath3 , which constrains the flavor structure of the nucleon sea .",
    "the results could be cross  checked against those from dilepton production in @xmath54 collisions , which separate quark flavors through selection of @xmath55 ( drell  yan ) , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 events , and be used to test the universality of the sea quark densities @xcite .",
    "the isovector @xmath3 would also permit quantitative studies of small@xmath2 dynamics in the non - singlet sector , which is largely unexplored and raises many interesting questions ( qcd structure of reggeon exchange , non - singlet diffraction , etc . ) . in practice",
    "such studies will likely be limited to the region @xmath58 , as the difference between proton and neutron structure functions becomes very small at low @xmath2 [ @xmath59 at @xmath60 for @xmath61 and would be increasingly difficult to determine from separate measurements .",
    "lastly , the results for @xmath53 itself would serve as stringent test for models of nuclear effects in heavier nuclei .",
    "dis on the deuteron with spectator proton tagging could be used to address other interesting physics questions besides free neutron structure .",
    "the recoil momentum dependence of the effective neutron structure function in @xmath24 allows one to study the modification of the neutron s partonic structure as a function of its momentum in the deuteron wave function  a qualitative improvement compared to usual inclusive measurements .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that the modification of the effective neutron structure function in the deuteron is in first approximation proportional to the neutron s virtuality @xmath62 , which is controlled by the measured recoil momentum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the modification is related in a simple way to the emc effect in inclusive nuclear structure functions of heavier nuclei ( @xmath63 ) and exhibits similar @xmath2dependence .",
    "measurements of the recoil momentum dependence of the effective neutron structure function in @xmath24 thus provide direct insight into the dynamical origin of the emc effect .",
    "in particular , measurements at large recoil momenta @xmath64 could verify a possible connection between the emc effect and short ",
    "range @xmath23 correlations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "measurements of the recoil momentum dependence in @xmath24 at finite @xmath65 and @xmath66 also provide a unique method for studying nuclear final  state interactions in dis at @xmath67 .",
    "the results of such measurements could be used to refine phenomenological models of the final  state interactions @xcite , which would improve the precision of neutron structure extraction from inclusive nuclear scattering data ( including @xmath63 ) .",
    "polarized dis on the deuteron with spectator proton tagging can be used to determine the free neutron spin structure function @xmath68 . the method for eliminating nuclear effects described above",
    "can straightforwardly be extended to double  polarized scattering .",
    "the simplest case is that of a longitudinally polarized electron beam colliding with a longitudinally polarized deuteron beam , where `` longitudinal '' refers to the respective beam directions . ; its effect on the net polarization along the @xmath28 vector direction can easily be calculated and is very small .",
    "] one measures the cross section of conditional double  polarized dis @xmath69 as a function of the recoil proton momentum variables ; the recoil proton polarization remains undetected and is summed over .",
    "the on - shell extrapolation in @xmath32 could in principle be performed directly with the polarized cross sections , using the same formulas as in the unpolarized case .",
    "it is more convenient , however , to work with the spin asymmetry @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the conditional cross section for the spin projections @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in eq .",
    "( [ a_parallel ] ) the nucleon pole @xmath39 in the cross sections cancels between numerator and denominator ( as do most of the nuclear modifications at @xmath38 ) , and the asymmetry naturally has a smooth dependence on @xmath32 . figure  [ fig : pol ] shows a simulated measurement of the conditional spin asymmetry at meic as a function of @xmath32 ( @xmath45 , integrated luminosity @xmath74 = 20 times higher than in the unpolarized simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron]c ) @xcite .",
    "the projections shown here were made using a simple model of deuteron structure that does not include the @xmath12wave , assumes the same nuclear modification of polarized and unpolarized cross sections at @xmath38 , and therefore does not have an explicit @xmath32dependence of the asymmetry ; in a more realistic model there would be a weak residual @xmath32dependence at @xmath38 due to the said effects . figure  [ fig : pol ] shows that an accurate measurement of the conditional spin asymmetry could be made over a range of @xmath75 with the proposed setup , and that the on - shell extrapolation could be performed as in the unpolarized case .",
    "more elaborate simulations , assuming general deuteron polarization ( mixed states , tensor polarization ) and using realistic deuteron wave functions , are in progress @xcite .",
    "the on - shell ( extrapolated ) asymmetry can then directly be used to extract the _ free neutron _",
    "spin structure function .",
    "an important simplification occurs because the @xmath12wave contribution to the cross section is very small at the on - shell point , as it is proportional to a higher power of the recoil proton rest  frame momentum .",
    "it implies that the deuteron wave function at the pole can be regarded as a practically pure @xmath76wave , in which the neutron is completely polarized along the deuteron spin direction , and renders further analysis as simple as in the case of a polarized nucleon target : @xmath77 where @xmath12 is a kinematic factor ( depolarization factor ) , and the neutron structure functions are evaluated at @xmath34 ( complete expressions will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "spectator tagging with on - shell extrapolation thus overcomes both the dilution and the neutron polarization uncertainties associated with inclusive nuclear measurements .",
    "the method outlined here would enable precision measurements of the neutron spin structure function @xmath68 over a wide kinematic range without any model - dependent nuclear structure input .",
    "the neutron data thus obtained could be used in several ways to advance our understanding of nucleon spin structure and qcd .",
    "combined with the proton data they would determine the isovector polarized structure function @xmath4 , which exhibits particularly simple qcd evolution ( no mixing with gluons ) and can be used to cleanly separate leading  twist and higher  twist dynamics .",
    "they would also enable precision tests of the bjorken sum rule , and possibly a determination of the strong coupling @xmath78 competitive with other methods ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis using fixed ",
    "target data ) . the isoscalar structure function @xmath5 could be used to determine the polarized gluon density from the leading  twist qcd evolution .",
    "proton and neutron data combined would allow one to better separate quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin , and to determine the flavor composition of the quark spin .",
    "the status of global qcd fits to determine the polarized parton densities and the need for eic data have have been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "a dedicated study of the impact of spectator tagging with polarized deuterons on polarized parton densities is planned .",
    "the center  of  mass energy of the electron ",
    "deuteron collision is an important parameter in the spin asymmetry measurements described here . according to eq .",
    "( [ a_parallel ] ) the magnitude of the observable spin asymmetry @xmath79 is determined by the depolarization factor @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the usual @xmath82 ratio of the unpolarized cross sections , and @xmath83 is the scaling variable measuring the electron fractional energy loss in the target rest frame .",
    "one sees that @xmath12 decreases proportionally to @xmath83 if @xmath84 . to maximize the observable @xmath79 one wants to keep @xmath83 at values of order unity .",
    "now at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath15 one has @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "we conclude that one should do the measurement at squared cm energies @xmath87 not much larger than @xmath88 , such that one can keep @xmath83 of order unity in the region of interest .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : sdep ] , which shows the projected observable spin asymmetry @xmath79 at a fixed @xmath15 as a function of @xmath2 , for different values of @xmath87 .",
    "the projected values of the asymmetry here were calculated using the parametrization of the neutron spin structure function provided by the global qcd fit of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the differences to more recent fits are unimportant for the point illustrated here ) .",
    "one sees how the observable asymmetry at a given @xmath15 and @xmath2 decreases if measured at `` too large '' center  of  mass energies .",
    "it underscores the need for an eic design that can deliver high luminosity over a _ range of center  of  mass energies _ appropriate to the measurements in question .",
    "the spectator tagging method described here can be extended to measurements in which the final state of the dis process on the neutron is analyzed further in coincidence with the spectator proton .",
    "measurements of single  inclusive hadron production in the current fragmentation region @xmath89 ( semi - inclusive dis on the neutron ) could further constrain the partonic structure of the nucleon by tagging the charge and flavor of the struck quark in the neutron .",
    "combined with proton data such measurements could conclusively determine the flavor structure of the light nucleon sea ( polarized and unpolarized ) and separate strange and non - strange quark densities .",
    "neutron measurements through spectator tagging could also help in exploring the dynamical mechanisms generating single  spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive hadron production ( there are hints of large isovector structures , possibly related to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ) and determine the flavor structure of the nucleon s intrinsic transverse momentum distributions .",
    "finally , spectator tagging could be used to measure exclusive processes on the neutron ( deeply  virtual compton scattering , meson production ) , where the isospin dependence is essential for verifying the reaction mechanism and determining the generalized parton distributions .",
    "the spectator tagging measurements described here require integrated forward detectors with complete coverage for protons with low recoil momenta relative to beam momentum per nucleon ( @xmath90 ) , and sufficient recoil momentum resolution ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the meic interaction region and forward detection system have been designed for this purpose and provide fully sufficient capabilities for the physics program outlined here @xcite .",
    "the physics analysis of spectator tagging data also requires that the intrinsic momentum spread in the ion beam be sufficiently small to allow for accurate reconstruction of the actual recoil momentum at the interaction vertex .",
    "simulations show that with the meic beam parameters the `` smearing '' of the kinematic variables is very moderate and does not substantially affect the physics analysis ( the resulting uncertainty in @xmath32 is of the order @xmath92  the bin size in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron]c ) @xcite .",
    "the neutron spin structure measurements rely on the polarized deuteron beams that would become available with meic . in the figure8 ring",
    "no significant loss of polarization is expected during acceleration and storage of either protons or deuterons , so that the polarization is essentially maintained at the source level .",
    "it is expected that a longitudinal vector polarization in excess of 70% could be achieved for a deuteron beam with @xmath93 gev per nucleon @xcite , which would be sufficient for the measurements described here .    an r&d program in under way at jlab to develop simulation tools for spectator tagging with eic ( cross section models , event generators ) and demonstrate the feasibility of such measurements  @xcite .",
