    "most of the studies focused on the case of repulsive atom - atom interactions .",
    "however , more recently interest has grown on the properties of these systems when this interaction is made attractive and in particular on the appearance of cat like ground states whose description goes beyond the usual semiclassical approximations  @xcite .",
    "the structure of these ground states is determined by the ratio between interaction and tunneling strengths .    for repulsive interactions ,",
