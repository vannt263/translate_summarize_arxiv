    "gravitational lensing occurs when light travelling to earth from distant sources is deflected by the gravitational influence of an intervening massive object @xcite .",
    "the light source may be within the galaxy and lensed by planetary systems , which is useful in the search for planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or it may be from a very distant galaxy and lensed by another galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or galaxy cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with a quasar being lensed by a galaxy , many instances of which have been discovered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in such systems , multiple magnified images of the quasar are produced , with the image properties determined by the source emission profile , the lensing galaxy s mass distribution , and the relative position of the source and lens .",
    "assuming a smooth mass distribution for the lensing galaxy is sometimes enough to model the observed image configurations , but in other cases the effect of the compact objects within the galaxy ( stars , planets , etc . )",
    "must also be considered . due to the intricate nature of the light paths through a galaxy of myriad objects ,",
    "a slight change in the location of the background source can produce a change in the image magnifications ( independent of any intrinsic source variability ) .",
    "this effect of the compact structure is called _ microlensing _ @xcite , and identifiable microlensing fluctuations of high amplitude are called _ high magnification events_. these events can last for relatively short durations  months or even weeks @xcite  and usually occur with a frequency of decades .",
    "the angular size of the source is important for microlensing , as larger sources will `` wash out '' the location - induced variability in magnification @xcite , so it is small sources that produce the most significant high magnification events .",
    "the shape of the source emission profile also affects microlensing @xcite .",
    "therefore , observations and modelling of flux variability can provide an estimate of source size and flux emission profile .",
    "apparent chromatic effects are also seen @xcite   because if an extended source emits different frequencies from separate regions , the frequencies will be magnified differently , and the source spectrum will be altered . like the magnification",
    ", the spectrum may also change over time , and studying spectral variability can lead to possible spectral emission profiles . in these ( and other ) ways microlensing becomes a useful tool for astronomical research @xcite .    in this paper we present results of numerical analyses of the microlensing of a water maser in a known microlensing system , mg 0414 + 0534 .",
    "we use several physically - motivated models to represent the maser source ; each model is characterised by its shape , size , emission and velocity profile . a model",
    "is then subjected to numerical microlensing so that the alteration in the spectrum and flux after lensing can be found .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section [ background ] discusses the maser in mg 0414 + 0534 , and mechanisms used for numerical microlensing analysis . in section [ method ]",
    "we describe the parameters characterizing the mg 0414 + 0534 lens , we specify the maser source models , and explain how the models are used .",
    "section [ results ] presents the results of microlensing of the maser by examining which models induce the most variability , what time scales may be expected for this , what forms the spectra take and how they vary over time , and whether the models match the current observation .",

    "rather , each point on the map represents the magnification of a pixel - sized source placed at that location , for all locations over the source plane region being modelled .",
    "brighter areas are high magnification regions and darker areas are low magnification regions , and are relative to a mean magnification value .",
    "notice that in the map there are thick lines or `` trunks '' of high magnification running up and down , these are the effects of the shear which imposes a directional trend on the map .",
    "it is not known what the true shear direction is for mg 0414 + 0534 .",
    "the break - out box shows a region of the map at high resolution ; one can see intricate patterns of light and dark which are called _",
    "caustics_. as a source moves across these the magnification varies , particularly when the source crosses a bright edge , leading to high magnification events .",
    "the einstein radius is defined in the next subsection .",
    "spatially extended sources are studied by convolving source models with the magnification map . to study the _ differential microlensing _",
    "@xcite of frequencies emitted from separate regions of an extended source , each region is cut from the source and convolved separately to obtain a magnification for that frequency , and then combined to produce a microlensed spectrum . if this is done for points along a path in the source plane then a time - varying spectrum for a source is obtained .",
    "microlensing systems are characterised by several time and spatial scales : the time between high magnification events , the duration of their occurrence , and the characteristic distance scale : the _ einstein radius_. an einstein ring is generated from the simplest lensing situation , where a point source is directly behind a point lens , both perfectly in line with the observer . in that case",
    "the image that is produced is a circle around the lens .",
    "the observed angle @xmath9 between the lens and the circle circumference is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 the speed of light , @xmath12 the gravitational constant , @xmath13 the lens mass , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the distance from lens to source , observer to lens , and observer to source , respectively .",
    "projecting @xmath9 onto the source plane produces a distance called the einstein radius ( er ) .",
    "thus , the er incorporates many aspects of the lens system , and is used as a length scale in microlensing analysis .",
    "it also indicates the size scale relevant for sources ; sources of order 1 er in size , and smaller , are more likely to be susceptible to microlensing than larger sources ( see @xcite for the microlensing of large sources ) . for mg 0414",
    "+ 0534 we calculate the er based on a point mass of 1 @xmath16 , since that size object will be used in our model galaxy . with a redshift for the lens of z = 0.9584 and for the quasar of z = 2.639 , and assuming a concordance cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , then 1 er @xmath20 0.013 pc .",
    "the er can be converted to a time scale if the relative velocity of the observer , lens , and source is known .",
    "changes over time , rather than the er , represent an observable of the lens system . @xcite derive a velocity of 170 km s@xmath1 for converting source distance to time in mg0414 + 0534 , so the time to travel 1 er is 77 years .",
    "we use the inverse ray - shooting method @xcite developed by @xcite and parallelized by @xcite , to produce the magnification maps .",
    "source models ( detailed below ) are convolved using fourier transforms .",

    "spectra are then extracted from a line across the map chosen to exhibit variability , and plotted for graphical examination .",
    "parameters are extracted and reduced to measures of variability .",
    "the convergence and shear for mg 0414 + 0534 are taken from @xcite and listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    "the maser has been observed in images a1 and a2 , so only these will be modelled . for each image ,",
    "two magnification maps are used with different resolutions , because the models represent masers of various sizes .",
    "the highest resolution maps span a source plane region of @xmath21 pc@xmath22 ( @xmath23 er@xmath22 ) , the lower resolution maps cover @xmath24 pc@xmath22 ( @xmath25 er@xmath22 ) .",
    "all maps contain @xmath26 pixels giving a source size resolution of @xmath27 au@xmath22 and @xmath28 au@xmath22 respectively , around the size of the solar system .",
    "all objects comprising the lens have masses of 1 solar mass ( m@xmath29 ) .",
    "the number of objects is determined by the lens model and reaches 241,562,900 for the low resolution map for image a2 .",
    "the map shown in figure [ big_map ] is the @xmath21 pc@xmath22 map for image a1 , and the a2 map is similar in appearance .",
    "we assign directions to the map so that the orientation of maser models can be discussed . north ( n )",
    "points up and east ( e ) is to the right , as in a land map .",
    "the directions are significant because they relate to the direction of shear that produces vertical patterns in the maps , which by our convention run n - s .      to model lensing of the maser in mg 0414 + 0534 we have chosen several types of source models of varying levels of complexity .",
    "we assume the maser material is transparent , and emitting isotropically . because we wish to study the effect of microlensing on the spectrum and total flux ,",
    "each model needs a size , a spatial flux emission profile , and a spatial frequency emission profile .",
    "the first two are described in figure [ schemes ] .",
    "the third is specified by the velocity profile of the source components , which translates to a frequency emission profile due to doppler shifts .",
    "however , the maser velocities are not well - understood , as discussed in section [ lens and maser ] . therefore we use the geometry of the model , and estimates based on observations , to obtain velocities for the masers , but scale them so that the line - of - sight velocity falls in a range of 100 km s@xmath1 ( except for the single spot which has no range ) .",

    "* ) . as well as a smooth area",
    ", we use a group of spots , and replace the smooth patch with a collection of 49 spots called a grainy patch .",
    "the extent of the patch and the velocity profile remains the same , but it consists of single spots , randomly located within a circular region .",
    "figure [ schemes ] ( a ) has the schematic for the grainy patch , and ( d ) shows the resultant model , the smooth patch is not shown .",
    "if the jet in mg 0414 + 0534 is mostly face - on then it may be possible to observe masers situated in a ring around the jet .",
    "figure [ schemes ] ( b ) shows the schematic of such a ring , where there are 200 single spots in a ring of diameter 0.5 pc .",
    "the location of each spot has been randomly perturbed from the true ring .",
    "the ring is assumed to lie @xmath8 1.4 pc along a conical jet , with an opening angle of @xmath32 , allowing the ring to be oriented by orienting the jet .",
    "the jet has two degrees of freedom .",
    "firstly , the angle of inclination determines whether the jet is perpendicular or parallel to the plane of the sky , in other words parallel to the plane of the magnification map .",
    "an inclination of @xmath33 means the jet is pointing out of the map towards you , and @xmath34 is fully side - on .",
    "secondly , when the jet is inclined it may be pointing in a different compass direction on the map : south / east etc .",
    "the orientation of the ring has an impact on the lensing , as will be shown later .",
    "the ring at an inclination of @xmath35 is shown in figure [ schemes ] ( e ) .",
    "the jet material is outflowing , but the maser material in the ring is possibly turbulent and the velocity is not well known .",
    "however we will assume an overall bulk maser motion in a similar direction to the jet .",
    "therefore we set the velocity of the masers to be in the same direction as the jet material they lie next to , but scaled so the line - of - sight velocity of the entire model falls between -350 and -250 km s@xmath1 , the same as the for the patches .",
    "this range applies regardless of how the ring is oriented , except when it is face - on , in which case the line - of - sight velocity is the same around the ring and set to 300 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we will call this model the grainy ring .",
    "this model consists of two identical jets in a bi - conical configuration outflowing from a quasar core .",
    "each jet is 1.59 pc long , beginning at a base of width 0.13 pc with an opening angle of @xmath36 for 0.53 pc , and then narrowing to @xmath37 for 1.06 pc , producing a jet diameter of 0.64 pc at the limit of the model .",
    "the numbers are chosen because of the pixel resolution of the model .",
    "the schematic for one jet is shown in figure [ schemes ] ( c ) .",
    "the maser emission region begins 0.66 pc out along the jet axis and extends to the end .",
    "the maser material can exist all around the jet edge so it forms a truncated hollow cone , or it can be distributed through the jet , producing a solid cone .",
    "these will be called the `` hollow jets '' and `` solid jets '' models . if a cross section is cut though a jet perpendicular to its axis producing a ring or disk , the flux over that ring or disk remains constant as it travels out from the core with the jet material .",
    "the bi - conical jet structure can be inclined in the same way as the jet carrying the ring described in the previous subsection . since both jets are conical outflows we use the same method for obtaining the maser velocities as for the grainy ring , but with some differences . since the maser material extends along the jets we set the velocity to be decreasing linearly with distance outwards ,",
    "so the fastest material is near the core .",
    "because the velocity range is centered around 0 km s@xmath1 with a red- and blue - shifted jet on either side , the line - of - sight velocity will be scaled to a range of -50 to 50 km s@xmath1 .",
    "an example of the hollow jets inclined to the south - east by @xmath38 is shown in figure [ schemes ] ( f ) .",
    "we calculate the spectrum as the source travels across a region of high magnification on the map , specifically in a roughly s - e direction over one of the n - s `` trunks '' of high magnification caustics visible in figure [ big_map ] .",
    "this means the path will begin and end at areas of low magnification but pass across caustic regions of high density and complexity within the trunk .",
    "such a path is a continuous and representative sampling of the microlensing effects that are represented by the map .",
    "the path is chosen by eye from examining the magnification maps at high resolution , and is slightly different for each magnification map used .",
    "this method produces a time - varying spectrum from which two parameters are extracted which are measures of variability :    1 .   a measure of the movement of the velocity centroid of the spectrum 2 .",
    "the variation in total magnitude    in both cases the standard deviation of the distribution of values is used as the variability measure .",
    "the magnification map can be used to find the duration of , and the time between , high magnification events , which occur when the source passes over regions of high magnification in the map .   using a single spot for the source",
    ", we extract a light curve spanning the total width from east to west of the map for image a1 . scanning the light curve",
    "we find instances where the magnitude rises by 1 , indicating the onset of an event .",
    "the shortest distance between two such instances is 0.034 pc , giving a time of 195 years between events .",
    "the shortest distance in which the magnitude rises by a value 1 is 0.003 pc , corresponding to a time of 17 years for the rise time of an event .",
    "this translates into significant variability for sources with small substructure like spots . for the spectrum of the grainy patch model , over a period of 17 years",
    ", statistical analysis shows that a typical variation of 0.12 mag and 2.0 km s@xmath1 in velocity centroid is possible .",
    "these paths with variability in short intervals are more likely to be east - west across the north - south pattern of the shear visible in the map .",
    "a more detailed analysis is beyond this the scope of this paper but could be attempted in the future when more information is available , and using more sophisticated techniques ( eg .",
    "the variability measures indicate how microlensing affects a source model as it moves behind the lens , i.e. along the magnification map on the paths we have chosen .",
    "a summary of the results is depicted in the panels in figure [ overall ] .",
    "each panel is a graph of a variability measure ( vertical axis ) as a function of source model ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the top two panels show the light curve and velocity centroid variation for all models lensed within image a1 , the next two are the same , but for image a2 .",
    "the horizontal axis is the same for all panels , and only listed on the bottom panel .",
    "the vertical axis may be magnitude ( mag ) or velocity ( km@xmath39 ) for each panel , depending on the measure , and is labelled on the vertical axis of the panel .",
    "the horizontal axis values are codes indicating the model and orientation .",
    "major tick marks are labelled with a code indicating the model : ss = single spot , sp = smooth patch , gr = grainy ring , sj = solid jet , hj = hollow jet . for the models that can be oriented ,",
    "this code is followed by a direction : s = south , s - e = south east , e = east , and then @xmath40 , indicating the initial orientation of the model .",
    "the minor ticks that follow are increasing values of inclination , only @xmath41 and @xmath42 are shown .",
    "the grainy ring is inclined by @xmath40 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the jets by the same , as well as @xmath49 . by scanning along the horizontal axis",
    "one can immediately see the relative variability of all the models , by the height of the graph in a panel .    from these graphs several general comments can be made .",
    "the grainy patch and ring produce the highest variability in velocity centroid , both about the same value of 7 km s@xmath1 , because they contain spots , i.e. small similar substructure",
    ". however the grainy patch produces more magnitude variability relative to the ring because it is smaller overall than the ring .",
    "the single spot has no velocity centroid variation because its velocity range is below our resolution , but it has the highest magnitude variability ( 0.6 ) , because it is the smallest - sized model .",
    "in contrast , the variability for the jet models is low on both measures , because the models are large .",
    "the smooth patch has variability in both measures , less than the grainy models and more than the jet models , and an unexpectedly high variation in velocity centroid , considering it has no substructure .",
    "this variation will be explained in section [ forms small ] based on its spectral behaviour . using a simple measure of variability per model ",
    "a sum of the rankings for centroid and magnitude for both images  the models in descending order of variability are : grainy patch , grainy ring ( best at i=@xmath50 east ) , single spot , smooth patch , hollow jets , solid jets .",
    "the overall variability is similar for both images a1 and a2 .    the orientation relative to the shear changes the variability for those models that can be oriented .",
    "any orientation that produces structures parallel to the direction of shear in the map , i.e. n - s , will induce higher microlensing variability .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the centroid variability produced by the grainy ring in image a1 ( figure [ overall ] , top panel ) .",
    "as the direction changes from south to east , and with a high inclination , the ring presents a thin n - s profile , so the microlensing variability increases . in the case of the jets , when they are n - s and highly inclined , the entire structure is in the direction of shear and so shows the most magnitude variability .",
    "the jets will be discussed separately from the other models since they have a different velocity spread and we will see they behave differently under inclinations .",
    "the form of the spectra for these source models is given in figure [ unlensed_spectra ] .",
    "the single spot shows a single peak with no velocity spread .",
    "the smooth patch produces a gaussian spectrum , as it is a gaussian model .",
    "the grainy patch has a multi - peaked spectrum due to the many small spots .",
    "the grainy ring shows the typical spectrum shape generated by a ring structure , with two peaks on the sides of the spectrum and a continuum between them , it is slightly broken because of the grainy nature .",
    "the spectra in figure [ unlensed_spectra ] are good representative examples as the spectra for all models retain those overall shapes even when inclined ( remember the velocities have been normalised to always lie in the range of -350 to -250 km s@xmath1 ) , and they also retain that overall shape when lensed .",
    "the changes that occur due to microlensing can be described either as an overall rise and fall or the introduction / disappearance / movement / magnification of small peaks or folds .",
    "figure [ lensed_spectra ] contain typical examples of these phenomena , each spectrum is the lensed spectrum over time corresponding to the unlensed spectrum of figure [ unlensed_spectra ] . the single spot shows how the magnification can rise and drop significantly when the quasar is travelling across a trunk of high magnification on the magnification map .",
    "the peak in the velocity axis rises from time = 0 yrs to a maximum when time @xmath8 500 yrs , and then drops sharply after that .",
    "the smooth patch when lensed has a similar peak that rises and falls over time , but in the velocity axis the peak is wide and smooth .",
    "one can also see that at time=0 yrs , velocity @xmath8 -280 km s@xmath1 there is a fold , which diminishes over time .",
    "also , although it is difficult to see in figure [ lensed_spectra](b ) , the entire peak for the smooth patch drifts from left to right on the velocity axis , explaining the high centroid variability for this model ; otherwise , it would have a very low centroid variability .",
    "the grainy patch has many peaks which rise and fall at different times , due to the substructure in the model , with an overall rise and fall as in the previous spectra .",
    "the grainy ring varies in flux but only shows some rise and fall at the edges , and at different times ; it also shows an interior ridge formed by a peak that appears near velocity @xmath8 -260 km s@xmath1 at time @xmath8 400 yrs and then moves to the other side of the spectrum arriving at velocity @xmath8 -340 km s@xmath1 at time @xmath8 700 yrs , mimicking the drift in the smooth patch spectra .",
    "other ring orientations manifest similar behaviours .",
    "the rise and fall of the spectra , as in the single spot , will affect the total observed brightness of the maser line over time ; the change of folds and peaks will affect the location of the velocity centroid of the broadened maser line over time .",
    "we do not see any dramatic changes in spectrum shape , based on viewing all the spectra obtained .",
    "the jets are a bi - conical structure with identical outflowing jets on either side .",
    "the velocity profile is a linear velocity gradient out from the core , red- or blue - shifted on each side . with this model",
    "the form of the unlensed spectrum can change significantly depending on the orientation , but not over time , in contrast to the other models .",
    "figure [ unlensed_spectra_jet ] shows two solid jets models and two hollow jets models before lensing .",
    "the solid jets and hollow jets when face - on produce an identical spectrum because the fluxes are normalized to be the same , and in this orientation the observed velocities will be the same .",
    "the apparent peaks are due to the resolution of the velocity slicing , if the resolution was very small the spectra would be smooth and flat .",
    "when the same models are inclined by @xmath51 , they both transform into a single peak , which becomes sharper the more inclined they are .",
    "figure [ lensed_spectra_jet ] shows the same models after lensing , and it is clear there is little change due to lensing , because the jet structure is large compared to the einstein radius and does not undergo significant microlensing .",
    "there is some variation right at the peak with small folds coming or going , but the flux is fairly constant , indicating little variation in the spectrum over time .",
    "what is of more interest with this structure is the spectra produced by different inclinations . starting with a square wave when face - on , _ both",
    "_ the solid and hollow jets spectra can merge towards a single smooth peak whether lensed or unlensed , with microlensing producing slight variations at the peak over time .",
    "this has implications for matching source models with the observed spectra .",
    "several factors make it difficult to choose which of our models can produce the observed maser line .",
    "firstly , in a source with multiple components , some components may be de - magnified by microlensing and thus not appear in the spectrum ; observation over long time scales may reveal these . secondly , the entire maser spectrum may not be clearly visible because of noise in the signal or components of the maser spectrum may lie below the detection limit .",
    "thirdly , the observed line is coincident with an hi absorption trough @xcite , possibly masking a different spectral signature .",
    "fourthly , the observed line is the combined spectra of both image a1 and a2 .",
    "although the images have similar microlensing properties and similar variability measures , the spatial correlation between the high resolution maps for a1 and a2 is only 56% .",
    "this indicates that some high magnification events do not correlate between the two images in either magnification or epoch of observation",
    ". it would be preferable to observe the maser line in a1 and a2 separately , since this will provide extra information to use to distinguish between models .",
    "naturally the last three issues are due to the technical limitations of the observation , and will improve in the future .    to match the observation , we look for models that have produced a single peak .",
    "the single spot has a peak , but it is not likely to be realistic since masers in jets usually occur in groups of spots .",
    "the smooth patch produces a smooth peak that is broad and maintains its shape , rising and falling with changing magnification , although it may drift around in velocity . therefore if observation shows little change in shape , but changes in flux and centroid , the smooth patch is indicated .",
    "the grainy patch produces several peaks depending on the arrangement of maser spots , and our model deliberately includes a large peak which could match the observation . the existence of other smaller peaks in the model spectrum , but not seen in the observed spectrum , does not lessen the likelihood for the grainy patch",
    ". such peaks may be currently de - magnified or lie below the noise , either within the current observed line or at lower or higher velocities outside it . in the latter case",
    "the grainy patch model remains valid as our velocity range is artificial and can also be expanded .",
    "if future observations resolve smaller peaks , or peaks appear over time , the grainy patch model is consistent with the observation .",
    "the grainy ring produces two clear peaks at the higher and lower ends of the spectrum and we do not observe enough microlensing variation that could produce a single peak , so this model appears less likely .",
    "interestingly , the jet models are capable of producing a smooth single peak , which varies insignificantly over time in either velocity or flux .",
    "if the observed maser spectrum exhibited the same properties , then the jet models would be consistent with the observation .",
    "however , an inclination of more than 50@xmath52 is required to produce such a spectrum , and since the quasar is believed to be not so inclined , this mitigates against the jet models .",
    "a search for masers in other lensed agns has not been successful @xcite , partly due to the lack of required sensitivity in existing telescopes , but that will improve .",
    "however , predictions have been made about the detectability of lensed agn masers assuming a magnification of 35 for mg 0414 + 0534 based on analytic strong lensing models @xcite.using the single spot as a source , we found a peak magnification of 91 can be achieved in image a2 , with a magnification of 35 or better achieved 22% of the time .",
    "if long - term observing , combined with models of the system , show that the typical magnification is lower than 35 , this indicates the maser is more intrinsically luminous than previously thought , with consequences for the rate of detection .",
    "observations of jet masers in active galaxies indicate that the masers typically exist in a group with a velocity range of the order 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the maser in mg 0414 + 0534 consists of a single peak .",
    "this is not consistent with a group of maser spots that produces multiple peaks , unless some peaks are lost in noise , or currently de - magnified , which is certainly possible . on the other hand",
    "the observation could be a smooth patch of masers , or a smooth distribution through the inner parts of the quasar jets , all of which also produce a single peak .",
    "a patch of spots will produce the most variability , in both velocity centroid and magnitude , the smooth patch will produce less  it may drift in velocity but remain fairly constant in shape  the jets will not change at all . a source with substructure like a patch of spots could produce changes in the spectrum within a couple of hundred years , lasting for 10 - 20 years .",
    "these results are just the beginning of the numerical analysis of this lensed maser , and continuing work would include :    * developing physically consistent models based on future observations and new understanding of masers * developing statistical tools for the extraction of histograms , structure functions , and other data from the high resolution magnification maps    but it would be prudent to wait for observations that have a higher sensitivity and resolution of flux and velocity , and in particular that are able to detect the maser in images b and c. a long - term monitoring program should be carried out on this source , either with a large single dish or a sensitive vlbi array ( e.g. the european vlbi network ) with higher resolution than the original effelsberg observations , with the following aims :    * monitoring should be conducted on monthly time scales to pick up short term fluctuations as well as building statistics for long term variability * the a1 and a2 image spectra should be separated , which allow a comparison of the spectral behaviour between the two images for all the models , adding information that may constrain the choice of model * observations at higher spectral resolution may allow a more accurate determination of the spectral shape ; differential fluctuations over time due to substructure will help to determine the morphology of a maser group .",
