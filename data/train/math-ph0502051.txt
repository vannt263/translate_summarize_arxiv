    "the study of steiner trees was shown to be useful for understanding the structure of biomacromolecules @xcite , through the application of combinatorial optimization techniques .",
    "these methods have been usually applied in the modelling of configurations of evenly spaced points along right circular helices since these are adequate to fit the average atomic positions .",
    "some writers have failed in their efforts at correlating the steiner ratio with the potential energy of a given special configuration .",
    "they did nt succeed in this trial to develop a robust method of global optimization . in the present work we propose to extend the concept of a steiner ratio into that of a srf @xcite .",
    "this was possible by working with experimental data obtained from a modification of the w. d. smith s algorithm @xcite , which was adapted to work with only one topology . in our experiments , we have followed the prescription of using the topology of the sausage configuration @xcite .",
    "the study of the candidates for srf is part of a full geometric approach to the problem of macromolecular structure .",
    "it has deep connections with the problem of a good definition of chirality measure @xcite , as well as it provides nice insights in the understanding of the homochirality phenomena and its importance for the stability of macromolecular configurations .",
    "it seems that chirality of biomacromolecules has so a fundamental importance that its study deserves the use of more powerful methods than those usually considered by combinatorial optimization . in our first approach",
    ", we proposed a chirality function as a constraint in a thermodynamically inspired idea of constructing a new cost function as a gibbs free energy @xcite . in a more elaborate theory , the aspects of potential energy of the configuration and its chirality should come from a self - contained steiner function .",
    "there will be no need for a constraint . at the present stage of our research",
    ", we have to pave the way for this future theory by undertaking the study of possible candidates for srf .",
    "we have also taken into consideration the restrictions imposed by the natural requirement of full steiner trees .",
    "let us consider a finite set of points @xmath0 in a metric manifold @xmath1 .",
    "we consider all the possible ways ( @xmath2-topologies ) of connecting pairs of points on each set of this manifold .",
    "the resulting edges are supposed to be geodesics of the manifold and their collection is a tree .",
    "we get a spanning tree ( sp ) by discarding the edge of greatest length . among these spanning trees of the set",
    "@xmath0 with different @xmath2-topologies and length @xmath3 , there is one which overall length is a minimum as compared to all the trees of the same set .",
    "this is the minimum spanning tree of the set @xmath0 , mst(a ) , and its length is @xmath4    if we now allow for the introduction of additional points on each set @xmath0 of the manifold in order to have spanning trees of smaller overall length , we shall have the concept of a steiner tree ( st ) . in the construction of these trees we have to follow the additional requirement of the tangent lines to the geodesic edges meeting at @xmath5 on each steiner ( additional ) point ( @xmath6-topologies ) . among these steiner trees of the set @xmath0 with different @xmath6-topologies and length @xmath7 , there is one which overall length is a minimum .",
    "we call it the steiner minimal tree of the set @xmath0 , @xmath8 .",
    "its length is given by @xmath9    the @xmath10 is considered as the worst approximation ( the  worst cut \" ) to the @xmath11 . it is usual to associate a number to this couple of minimal trees of the set @xmath0 : the ratio of their overall lengths .",
    "this is calculated with the definition of distance of the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "this number is called the steiner ratio of the set @xmath12 .",
    "we write , @xmath13    the steiner ratio of the manifold @xmath14 is then defined to be the infimum of the sequence of values @xmath15 , or @xmath16",
    "the concept of a steiner ratio function is a specialization of the definitions above .",
    "it is better introduced by examples .",
    "we now suppose that all the sets @xmath0 of the manifold @xmath1 have the same number @xmath17 of points .",
    "moreover , we also take these points @xmath18 to be evenly spaced points along a right circular helix .",
    "the cartesian coordinates of the sequence of consecutive points is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the pitch of the helix .",
    "equation ( 3.1 ) means that we have a helical point set for each pair of values @xmath21 .",
    "we now consider the subsequences of points obtained from ( 3.1 ) by skipping points .",
    "they are of the form @xmath22 , with @xmath23 ; @xmath24 number of skipped points ; @xmath25 number of intervals of skipped points before the present point .",
    "there are @xmath17 possible sequences . among these only @xmath26 of them contain different points .",
    "the process of construction of these subsequences is the following :    given a number of @xmath17 points evenly spaced along a right circular helix , we form a @xmath27subsequence with @xmath28 skipped points , and a maximum @xmath29value . since the index @xmath30 should be restricted by @xmath31    we have @xmath32\\enspace .\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 $ ] stands for the greatest integer value .",
    "a @xmath27subsequence is then given by @xmath34    we also define a sequence which is the union of all the @xmath27subsequences by defining connection edges of the highest end and/or lowest end consecutive points @xmath35    some examples will be worth to illustrate the results above .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "we shall have @xmath39 and @xmath40    the subsequences are",
    "@xmath41    * 2 . *",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we have @xmath44 and @xmath45    the subsequences are now @xmath46    the sequence corresponding to ( 3.1 ) can be recovered by making @xmath47 , @xmath48 in the process described above , it can be also written as @xmath49 .",
    "to each sequence of the form ( 3.5 ) corresponds a spanning tree @xmath50 . in fig.1",
    ", we show the sequence of points of ( 3.1 ) and of the two examples above , respectively .",
    "[ hp ]    in the following , we take @xmath1 to be the @xmath51 manifold with an euclidean definition of distance , or @xmath52 .    the coordinates of the points @xmath22 are given analogously to ( 3.1 ) .",
    "the euclidean length of @xmath53point configurations like those of fig.1 above can be written , @xmath54 where @xmath55    there is only one steiner tree for all these point configurations .",
    "it has the 3-sausage s topology @xcite and its euclidean length @xcite is written as @xmath56 where @xmath57    the steiner points are also in a helix of the same pitch but smaller radius @xmath58 as compared to the points of the configuration ( 3.1 ) .    in order to adapt the formulae ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) to the present case of a srf definition",
    "we should note that if we take @xmath59 , all the sets @xmath60 should be considered as the same .",
    "this is a set of a great number of points evenly spaced in a right circular helix .    for @xmath59",
    ", we then have , from ( 2.2 ) , ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.14 ) , @xmath61 and from ( 2.1 ) , ( 3.11 ) and ( 3.12 ) , @xmath62    the steiner ratio function is now defined , according ( 2.3 ) , ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.16 ) as @xmath63    the  @xmath64 \" in the equation above should be understood in the sense of a new function formed in a piecewise way from the functions corresponding to the chosen @xmath65values . for @xmath66",
    "this means @xmath67    the associated steiner ratio for these helical point configurations will be given by the global minimum of the function @xmath68 above , according ( 2.4 ) .",
    "in fig.2 below , we represent a section of the srf given by ( 3.17 ) for @xmath69 .",
    "this is the pitch of a helical configuration in which the points are regular tetrahedra vertices .",
    "these tetrahedra are glued together at common faces to form a 3-sausage configuration @xcite .",
    "the condition for equal edges of the tetrahedra lead to the following equations :    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    only two of them are independent and the non - trivial solution is    @xmath73    we take @xmath66 and the points obtained from the w. d. smith s algorithm @xcite with a search space reduction , i.e. , adopting the 3-sausage s topology as the only feasible .",
    "the modified algorithm is available at the site www.biomat.org .",
    "[ hp ]    it should be noted from fig.2 that the function ( 3.17 ) is a very good fitting to the experiments which were done with the w. d. smith s algorithm .",
    "it is so a good fitting , that it has the same bad performance at some @xmath74region @xmath75 as can be seem in fig.2 above . although these can be easily explained by the difficulty of working with a quasi - plane configuration ( the neighbourhood of @xmath76 ) when we choose a priori 3-dimensional configurations , we prefer to circumvent this difficulty in the next section .",
    "we do it by introducing some necessary restrictions related to full steiner trees .    from the viewpoint of the search of a global minimum ,",
    "the surface given by ( 3.17 ) is also a very good candidate as can be seen from its level curves in fig.3 below    [ hp ]    if we substitute into ( 3.17 ) the values @xmath21 corresponding to the 3-sausage s configuration , or @xmath77 , @xmath78 , we get    @xmath79    which is the value given by the authors of @xcite for the best upper value for the steiner ratio of the @xmath52-manifold .",
    "in the last section there is no restriction to full steiner trees .",
    "we take as an assumption that the natural organization of biomacromolecular structure is biased by full steiner trees .",
    "a structure is non - degenerate or it is almost completely degenerate .",
    "nature can provide a process in which the steiner ratio is approaching continuously to the value @xmath80 .",
    "however , the tree can not be partially degenerate in the sense of partial full trees connected at degenerate vertices .    in this section",
    ", we emphasize that we need more stringent constraints , instead of a constraint relaxation for a good definition of srf .",
    " good \" means here the definition which leads to @xmath81values lesser than the value reported in section 4 if we believe that the main conjecture of the authors of @xcite could be disproved .",
    "if we look at fig.2 above , we can see that the algorithm used as well as the modelling based on ( 3.17 ) do not make any discrimination to degenerate steiner trees .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are regions of @xmath82-values in which @xmath83 is close to 1 . to each @xmath21 pair of values there",
    "is associated a point configuration .",
    "this means that there are regions in the line @xmath84 corresponding to degenerate configurations .",
    "this is also valid for other @xmath85values since these sections of the surface ( 3.17 ) have similar profiles .",
    "we can now introduce the restriction to full steiner trees .",
    "let us take the @xmath86 , @xmath26 subsequence of ( 3.4 ) .",
    "the points @xmath87 are evenly spaced along the corresponding right circular helix .",
    "the angle made by contiguous edges is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the euclidean norm .",
    "the cartesian coordinates of the points @xmath22 can be written analogously to ( 3.1 ) and we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 is given by ( 3.12 ) .    the restrictions to full steiner trees can be then written in the form @xmath92    in fig.4 below we show the restrictions introduced by ( 5.3 ) for @xmath66 .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the value @xmath93 .",
    "[ hp ]    the spanning trees corresponding to @xmath37 have a large forbidden region .",
    "the @xmath48 curve is the only one which corresponds to full steiner trees in a large region of the @xmath74interval studied in this work .",
    "the proposal for the steiner ratio function is given in this case by @xmath94    from ( 3.17 ) , we get @xmath95    fig.5 shows the sections @xmath96 of the surfaces given by ( 3.17 ) and ( 5.5 ) . by restricting our observations to the @xmath74interval in which the @xmath48 curve in fig.4 allows for full steiner trees , it should be noted that the section @xmath96 of the candidate for a srf given by ( 5.5 ) is the convex envelope @xcite of the section @xmath97 of ( 3.17 ) .",
    "the restriction of the point configurations only to those which lead to full steiner trees , has wiped out the global minima of the surface @xmath68 . the resulting surface @xmath98 satisfies the necessary bounds @xcite @xmath99 in the @xmath74interval          we need a constraint to be motivated by the natural organization of a macromolecular structure in our modelling .",
    "some interesting results have been obtained @xcite by introducing a function of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a lagrange multiplier and @xmath106 stands for a recently proposed function for chirality measure @xcite given by        it would be easy to announce a proof for the conjecture of @xcite or at least some very good arguments for a proof from the work of the last sections . however , in spite of the evidences which were reported here , we think that the approach adopted has given nice advances in our program of modelling the structure of biomacromolecules with steiner points and steiner trees .",
