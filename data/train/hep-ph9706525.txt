    "a unique experimental signature from the early stage of violent heavy ion collisions is provided by dilepton radiation .",
    "the ( thermal ) radiation of leptons is highest when the energy density has reached a maximum .",
    "since leptons are insensitive to strong interactions , the signal is not distorted during the further evolution of the system .",
    "recent reports on intermediate  @xcite and high mass  @xcite muon pairs produced in heavy ion collisions have attracted much attention .",
    "the suppression of the j/@xmath0 signal , as extracted from na38/na50 measurements , might indicate that deconfinement has been reached in central pb+pb reactions  @xcite . in the mass region below the @xmath1-meson ,",
    "on the other hand , the measured @xmath2 pair spectrum is enhanced relative to the expected ` cocktail ' of hadronic decays  @xcite .",
    "a good understanding of the continuum dilepton spectrum , in the relevant invariant mass window , is a prerequisite for the correct interpretation of the data .",
    "rate estimates of drell - yan pair production  @xcite have been performed systematically for different systems , energies , and invariant masses  @xcite .",
    "they are essentially based on extrapolations of p+a reactions where a linear scaling with a is observed for the drell - yan production cross section  @xcite : @xmath3 this linear scaling can be understood in the glauber picture of the hadron - nucleus cross section , constructed at high energies using the agk cutting rules  @xcite .",
    "( for a simple dynamical picture of this effect , see  @xcite . )    a number of different theoretical frameworks  @xcite have been used to explore the degree to which the hot matter produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions contributes to the total dilepton radiation .",
    "dilepton emission from thermal sources such as a quark - gluon plasma or hadron gas , whether in or out of equilibrium , can not be neglected relative to nucleon - nucleon contributions to the drell - yan process for masses below the j/@xmath0 peak  at least at higher energies than those presently available .",
    "another source of dileptons which has not been fully explored is drell - yan production by interactions between produced , or secondary , hadrons .",
    "unless these secondary dilepton sources are understood , the thermal contributions can not be reliably extracted . in this paper , we study possible refinements to drell - yan production in nucleus - nucleus collisions from secondary hadron interactions at current fixed - target energies .",
    "it is shown that these secondary collisions can serve as an important source of @xmath4  gev dileptons due to the availability of valence antiquarks in mesons and antibaryons .",
    "in order to investigate secondary dilepton production at sps energies values are still quite uncertain .",
    "therefore , we will not report any high energy calculations in this paper . ] a microscopic hadronic transport code , urqmd  @xcite , is employed to obtain a realistic collision spectrum of secondary hadrons .",
    "the differential drell - yan cross section is computed at leading order ( lo ) using the standard equation  @xcite : @xmath5 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the quark and antiquark densities , @xmath8 is the center - of - mass energy of the colliding hadrons , @xmath9 is the invariant mass of the lepton pair , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the dilepton rapidity in the _ cms _ frame .",
    "the convolution of the parton distributions is weighted by the square of the charge of the annihilating quarks , @xmath14 .",
    "since the calculation is performed at leading order only , the result is multiplied by a `` k - factor ''  @xcite . although the ratio between the calculated next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and lo drell - yan cross sections is a function of @xmath15 and @xmath13 , the dependence is small , @xmath16% for @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 at @xmath19 gev .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we have used a constant k factor .",
    "this is reasonable considering the accuracy of the present experimental data which does not reveal any strong mass dependence of the experimental k factor ( the ratio between the measured data and the lo calculation ) .    according to the urqmd hadronic model ,",
    "most of the interacting particles in the early stage of the reaction are baryon and meson resonances . in this study , if two hadrons have the same quark content , their parton distributions are assumed to be equivalent , e.g. the proton parton distributions are used for the @xmath20 and the pion parton distributions are used for the @xmath1 . we have employed the grv lo parametrizations of the parton distribution functions of nucleons  @xcite and pions  @xcite , since they provide a consistent set for both species ( same @xmath21 and similar initial scale @xmath22 ) .",
    "the lepton pair production cross section is calculated for each hadron - hadron collision and weighted by the inverse of the total hadron - hadron cross section .",
    "the distributions from these elementary hh - collisions are then summed .",
    "it is clear that in pion - nucleon , pion - pion and antinucleon - nucleon collisions , _ valence _ quark - antiquark annihilation can play a significant role in the drell - yan process . figure  [ struc ] shows the parton distribution functions of protons  @xcite and pions  @xcite from the grv  lo parametrization , for two different values of @xmath15 . for @xmath23 the probability to find an antiquark is much higher in a pion than in a nucleon",
    ". the pion - nucleon cross sections are consequently higher than the nucleon - nucleon cross sections , especially when @xmath24 .",
    "( see  @xcite . ) on the other hand , in heavy ion collisions the typical meson - baryon and antibaryon - baryon interactions are certainly less energetic than the primary nucleon - nucleon collisions .    while the usual drell - yan calculations of nucleus - nucleus collisions only consider interactions of the initial nucleons , in the present scenario four different processes may contribute : baryon - baryon , meson - baryon ( and meson - antibaryon ) , meson - meson where the whole meson is involved in the annihilation rather than a single parton . in any case , dileptons from pion annihilations are not expected to make an important contribution to the intermediate mass region we are concerned with here . ] and baryon - antibaryon interactions .",
    "thus , it is interesting to estimate the relative importance of these contributions to the total drell - yan cross section .",
    "the typical scaling of the drell - yan cross section with target mass observed in hadron - nucleus collisions , accounted for here , assumes an equal probability for drell - yan pair production in each nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "in addition , in a separate microscopic simulation the meson - baryon , meson - meson and baryon - antibaryon collisions , involving newly produced hadrons , are calculated within the urqmd transport model . in order to conserve energy and momentum ,",
    "the energy loss of baryons which have already interacted is taken into account in these _ secondary _ interactions .",
    "for simplicity , the produced hadrons follow straight - line trajectories across the reaction zone without energy loss ( @xmath25-scattering , only elastic interactions ) .",
    "the center of mass energy of these collisions is taken directly from the fully dynamical evolution of all hadrons within the urqmd simulation . in the usual cascade prescription ,",
    "leading hadrons , containing valence quarks from the incident nucleon , can interact within their formation time with a reduced but finite cross section . since the constituent _ antiquark _ content is much more relevant for the drell - yan process",
    ", we only consider collisions of formed hadrons .",
    "the formation time of produced hadrons , on average @xmath26  fm / c , is determined by the string fragmentation prescription used in urqmd  @xcite ( defined as the first crossing point of the quark and antiquark or quark and diquark which form the hadron ) .",
    "the exact formation time depends on the mass and momentum of the produced hadron . by imposing a minimum hadron formation time",
    ", we effectively neglect any possible annihilation of produced partons which have not yet hadronized ( `` preresonance '' scattering ) . in sec .",
    "[ primordials ] we return to this problem .",
    "important consequences for the sea quark distributions have recently been discussed : modifications at small @xmath27 and the violation of the gottfried sum rule  @xcite .",
    "two effects are primarily important at low @xmath27 .",
    "the hera data has shown a steep rise in the proton structure function @xmath28 for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the sea quark and gluon distributions can be significantly modified in nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "the observed low @xmath27 shadowing and the low @xmath27 rise in the parton sea distributions are not relevant for sps energies where @xmath30 for @xmath31 gev at midrapidity . at higher energies , such as those at rhic and lhc , these effects can not be neglected .",
    "however , as we now describe , the violation of the gottfried sum rule has important consequences at the sps energies .",
    "the gottfried sum rule defines the difference between the proton and neutron structure functions  @xcite @xmath32 since the neutron distributions are not directly measured , @xmath33 is obtained assuming that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "all global structure function analyses prior to 1992 assumed that the light - quark sea distributions are flavour independent , @xmath36 . on the contrary , based on their @xmath37 measurements",
    ", nmc found that  @xcite @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "a straightforward comparison implies that @xmath40 .",
    "these results have been confirmed by p+p and p+d asymmetry studies of drell - yan production by na51 @xcite and by preliminary results from e866 @xcite .",
    "the lack of a regge @xmath41 exchange degeneracy also leads one to expect that @xcite @xmath42 at small @xmath27 , where the regge intercept is @xmath43 .      since neither corresponding @xmath49 data nor parton distributions with a flavour asymmetric sea exist for pions , we use the flavour symmetric grv distributions for the pion @xcite in our meson interactions .",
    "one might suppose the asymmetry to be less pronounced for the pion since the @xmath50 and @xmath51 each contain a @xmath52 and a @xmath53 quark or antiquark .",
    "figure  [ na3 ] shows the mass spectrum of dimuons in p+pt collisions at @xmath54  gev / c for three different longitudinal momentum windows .",
    "our calculation with the grv 94 parton distributions provides a reasonable description of the na3 data  @xcite with @xmath55 .",
    "in addition we have compared the model calculation with p+cu collisions at @xmath56  gev / c  @xcite and found equally good agreement . in fact , the drell - yan mass and @xmath57 double differential cross sections measured by na3 @xcite , e605 @xcite and e772 @xcite experiments , are all in good agreement with each other , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the proton - nucleus calculations reveal that the contribution from secondary collisions is less than 10% of the dilepton yield for masses @xmath17  gev .",
    "the relative importance of secondary contributions decreases with increasing @xmath57 . at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the original glauber type calculation",
    "is increased by less than 1% , even at the lowest masses .",
    "the dimuon spectrum produced in @xmath60 reactions , at @xmath61  gev / c , as measured by the e537 experiment  @xcite , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fnal537 ] for a central and a forward @xmath57 bin .",
    "the results of our leading order calculations , scaled by a k factor of 2 , are shown . a different k factor relative to the value used in the proton - induced reactions",
    "is needed since we use the grv 92 pion set with the grv 94 proton set .",
    "although the measurements have large uncertainties , the agreement between our calculations and the data supports the validity of our treatment of secondary meson - baryon collisions .",
    "figure  [ sec ] shows the relative importance of the secondary dilepton production , compared to nucleon - nucleon collisions alone , for different projectile / target combinations . in the mass region",
    "around 2  gev the additional contributions are not negligible in nucleus - nucleus collisions while the increase is less than 5% in the p+w case . for masses above 3  gev , the additional production beyond nucleon - nucleon collisions from our hadronic calculation is less than 10% in both s+u and pb+pb interactions .",
    "evidently the high mass dilepton yield is not significantly enhanced by the relatively low energy secondary scatterings . at masses below 2  gev , on the contrary",
    ", it appears that the contribution from collisions of newly produced particles can not be neglected . at masses around 1.5  gev",
    ", an enhancement of 25% is expected in s+u interactions and 45% in pb+pb interactions .",
    "clearly , the importance of secondary contributions to the drell - yan cross section increases with the system size .",
    "note , however , that this enhancement is insufficient to account for the discrepancy reported in ref .",
    "@xcite between the data and the `` expected sources '' .",
    "although the perturbative qcd calculation of dilepton production at 2  gev and below can only be used as a qualitative guideline , it is clear that the low mass dilepton continuum in nuclear collisions can be enhanced relative to a linear superposition of nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "at least part of the observed enhancement of muon pairs at intermediate and low masses  @xcite might be caused by this previously neglected hadronic source .",
    "the perturbative calculation is definitely unreliable for masses below 1  gev where a substantial increase in electron pair production in nucleus - nucleus collisions has been observed  @xcite . to emphasize the theoretical uncertainty of the perturbative calculation for masses below 2  gev , in fig .",
    "[ sec ] and in the following figures , we use thinner lines in that region .",
    "the relative contributions to the calculated dilepton mass spectra at @xmath62 in central s+u and pb+pb collisions are presented in fig .",
    "the decomposition of the secondary dilepton yield into each channel ( meson - baryon , meson - meson , baryon - antibaryon ) shows that by far the most important secondary contribution is from meson - baryon interactions .",
    "for masses above @xmath63  gev they are virtually the only source of secondary dileptons . at midrapidity and for masses",
    "@xmath64  gev , they account for at least 90% of the secondary yield while meson - meson collisions contribute @xmath65% and baryon - antibaryon collisions contribute less than 1% .",
    "the standard drell - yan process corresponds to the interaction of fully formed hadrons . however ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that , during the early stages of the system evolution , partons can scatter and annihilate before they have come on mass - shell .",
    "thus , we postulate the existence of another dilepton source : the annihilation of quarks and antiquarks which are not yet bound in a color - singlet hadron .",
    "to estimate the importance of these `` primordial '' or `` preresonance '' @xmath66 annihilations , we have calculated the contribution of such processes assuming that the asymptotic parton distribution functions are also valid for the primordial states .",
    "this assumption is distinct from thermal dilepton production where the quark and antiquark are in a thermal environment , in or out of equilibrium , with temperature - dependent parton densities .",
    "we thus relax the restriction that the partons can only interact after they have hadronized .",
    "this is done very simply in our microscopic cascade calculation by decreasing the formation time of the produced hadrons , @xmath67 , from the `` default '' value of around 1  fm/@xmath68 .",
    "the importance of this primordial ( preresonance ) contribution to the dilepton mass spectra is shown in fig .",
    "we see that when we set @xmath69 , the secondary sources of dileptons become much more important than previously indicated . indeed ,",
    "the secondary dilepton yield increases by a factor of @xmath70 at all masses compared to the calculations with the default @xmath26  fm/@xmath68 .",
    "these primordial interactions also affect p+a reactions , enhancing the secondary contribution .",
    "for example , the dilepton yield at @xmath71  gev and @xmath72 shown in fig .",
    "[ na3 ] increases by 25% when @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , good agreement with the na3 data is retained .    in fig .",
    "[ prim ] we have also included a calculation with an intermediate formation time for the produced hadrons , @xmath74  fm / c , in order to study the sensitivity of the calculations to this ( model dependent ) parameter . as we might expect , the reduced average formation time leads to an increased dilepton yield due to the larger number of possible hadron - hadron interactions . with this value of the formation time ,",
    "the enhancement in the range @xmath75 gev shows quite good agreement with the intermediate mass data @xcite . on the other hand , an infinite formation time , @xmath76 ,",
    "corresponds to the exclusion of all secondary interactions , in agreement with the glauber - type drell - yan expectation .",
    "a recent work  @xcite has already pointed out the strong influence of the hadron formation time on dilepton production via @xmath77 annihilation .",
    "our study indicates that the lepton pair continuum cross section for masses up to 3  gev should not be interpreted solely in terms of drell - yan production in nucleon - nucleon interactions , even at sps energies .",
    "the yield from secondary contributions depends strongly on the rapidity region and , of course , on the dilepton mass .",
    "preresonance interactions are estimated to enhance the secondary yield by up to a factor of 5 .    because meson - baryon interactions dominate secondary lepton pair production , the relative importance of secondary dilepton sources evidently increases linearly with the number of produced pions at these energies .",
    "it may thus be possible to distinguish the secondary yield from thermal dilepton sources which are expected to scale quadratically with the pion multiplicity .",
    "the multiplicity dependence also indicates that the dilepton yield from scattering of secondaries is likely to be considerably higher at rhic and lhc energies .",
