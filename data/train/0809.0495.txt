    "the history and the evolution of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) are intimately related to the gravitational interactions between the two clouds and the milky way . in particular , the main episodes of star formation enhancement in the smc are triggered by the near , perigalactic passages of the lmc and of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the epoch and rate of the main star formation episodes in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are still matter of debate and several scenarios have been proposed . for the smc , while @xcite suggest 3 episodes occurred 400 myr , 3 gyr and 9 gyr ago , @xcite favor a more continuous star formation in the halo with a dominant episode 58 gyr ago .",

    "as well known the properties ( morphology and position ) of the rgb are sensitive function of the overall metallicity of the population . hence , the presence of a well populated rgb in the cmds shown in fig .  [ cmd1 ] allows us to derive a photometric measure of the cluster metallicity .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented a calibration of a set of morphological rgb parameters ( in the ir plane ) in terms of the cluster metallicity for a sample of old galactic globular clusters , by adopting both the @xcite iron metallicity scale and the global metallicity [ m / h ] , as computed by taking into account the enhancement of the @xmath5-elements .",
    "since the few available chemical information for the smc stellar population indicate solar scaled value of the [ @xmath5/fe ] abundance ratio ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use the [ fe / h ] scale as reference .",
    "we used the entire set of rgb parameters defined by @xcite in the ir planes ( @xmath0 , @xmath11-@xmath0 ) and ( h , j - h ) , namely the @xmath12 color at different absolute magnitudes @xmath13=(-3,-4,-5,-5.5 ) , the @xmath14 color at @xmath15=(-3,-4,-5,-5.5 ) , the @xmath0 absolute magnitude at fixed ( @xmath16)=  3 , the h absolute magnitude at @xmath14=  3 and the slope of the rgb .",
    "all the photometric parameters have been measured along the rgb cluster mean ridge lines .",
    "these fiducial ridge lines have been computed following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "first , we selected ( by eye ) stars belonging to the rgb in order to exclude he - clump , agb and field stars , then the second - order polynom has been fitted to the observed distribution .",
    "the ridge line has been transformed into the absolute plane by adopting a distance modulus of @xmath17=18.99 @xcite , the reddening listed in table  [ tab1 ] and the extinction law by @xcite . once the photometric parameters were measured , the various estimates of the cluster metallicity were computed from the equations listed in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "all these estimates turn out to be consistent one to each other ( with average dispersion of @xmath10.1 ) , so we assumed for each cluster metallicity the mean value ( and reported in table  [ tab2 ] ) , thus finding [ fe / h]=-1.18 , -1.08 , -0.99 and -0.96 dex for ngc  339 , 361 , 416 and 419 , respectively .",

    "we find their metallicities to be @xmath10.3 dex more metal - poor than ours ; this discrepancy can be mainly ascribed to the different adopted metallicity scales .",
    "indeed , the relations by @xcite are calibrated on the @xcite scale , while the @xmath18-[fe / h ] relation by @xcite is on the @xcite scale .      in order to compute the integrated magnitudes of the target clusters , we performed aperture photometry , with different aperture radii centered on the center of gravity . a crucial step in this procedure",
    "is the correct decontamination from the field population . to do this",
    "we performed an equivalent aperture photometry on each control field .",
    "the resulting field luminosity has been subtracted to the cluster luminosity .",

    "the latter has been estimated by computing aperture photometry using 4 different centers , shifted by @xmath95 pixels with respect to the @xmath4 coordinates .",
    "typically , we estimated an error of @xmath19 0.04 - 0.05 mag in each band , that translates in a errorbar of @xmath10.07 mag in color . + total luminosities ( in k@xmath20-band and bolometric ) have been computed by using the integrated magnitudes and adopting a distance modulus for the smc of @xmath17=18.99 @xcite , bolometric corrections ( by using the @xmath12 color ) empirically calibrated by @xcite and solar values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the following all the derived luminosities",
    "are expressed in units of @xmath23 .",
    "the main sources of error in this case are the uncertainty in the integrated magnitudes and in the bolometric corrections ( an additional variation of @xmath110% ) which translate into a @xmath15% and @xmath110% uncertainty in luminosity .",
    "in order to estimate the rgb and agb contributions to the total cluster light , we use star counts and population ratios , as obtained by adopting suitable _ selection boxes _ for each evolutionary sequence ( he - clump , rgb and agb ) , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ agb ] and  [ rgb ] ( see also paper i and ii ) .",
    "two main effects must be taken into account in the definition of these quantities , the incompleteness of the photometric catalog and the contamination by field stars .",
    "the degree of completeness can be quantified by adopting the widely - used artificial star technique , discussed in @xcite .",
    "for each cluster we have derived the rgb fiducial line and then a population of artificial stars , having magnitudes , colors , and luminosity functions resembling the observed distributions has been generated and added to the original images ( by using the daophot task addstar ) .",
    "the frame area sampling the cluster has been divided in 3 concentric regions with radii @xmath2420\" , 20@xmath2560  and 60@xmath2590  , in order to take into account different crowding conditions and the completeness has been estimated independently in each of them .",
    "the maximum spatial extension of each cluster has been estimated from the cluster radial density profile .",
    "a total of @xmath1200,000 artificial stars have been simulated in each cluster in about 1000 simulation runs . indeed , in order to not alter the crowding conditions , @xmath1100 - 200 stars have been simulated in each run , corresponding to @xmath110% of the total stellar population . the fraction of recovered objects in each magnitude interval has been estimated as @xmath26 : the completeness curve was obtained in each radial subregion and shown in fig .  [ comp ] . the correction for incompleteness in each radial region",
    "was performed by dividing each observed distribution by the corresponding @xmath27 factor .",
    "the total number of stars has been obtained by summing the number of stars in each subregion .",
    "it is worth noticing that this procedure allows to take into account only the loss of faint stars due to the crowding but not the possible excess of bright stars due to blending effects of two or more faint stars into a brighter one .",
    "however , this latter effect is marginal in the near ir .",
    "another important effect which needs to be investigated , is the degree of contamination of the selected samples by the foreground / background stars . in this paper",
    "we have applied a statistical decontamination , by using a control field adjacent to the cluster .",
    "the total number of stars observed in each evolutionary sequence ( agb , rgb and he - clump ) has been counted accordingly to the _ selection boxes _ both in the cluster and field cmds , and corrected for incompleteness ( see above ) .",
    "the star counts in the field population have been scaled to take into account the different surveyed area , and their contribution have been subtracted from the cluster population .    in summary",
    ", for each radial region , each selection box corresponding to each evolutionary stage has been divided in bins of magnitude ( typically 0.2 mag wide ) .",
    "then , the `` corrected '' number of stars in each bin has been computed as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of stars observed in that bin , the second term is the number of stars lost for incompleteness , @xmath30 is the expected number of field stars .",
    "the total luminosity of each evolutionary stage can be computed accordingly to the following relation : @xmath31 where the term @xmath32 is the total luminosity of stars observed in a given bin , @xmath33 is the number of stars lost for incompleteness , @xmath30 is the expected number of field stars , and @xmath34 is the equivalent luminosity of that bin , that is the luminosity of a star with magnitude equal to the mean value of the bin .",
    "+ finally , star counts and total luminosity of each evolutionary stage have been obtained by summing the contribution of all the bins . with @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the numerator and @xmath37 the denominator of the ratio , and by assuming that star counts follow a poisson statistics . ]",
    "the agb stars are the main contributors to the integrated ssp light between @xmath38 and @xmath39 yrs @xcite .",

    "+ @xcite analyzed 39 magellanic clusters in order to identify agb stars and concluded that up to 40% of the bolometric luminosity comes from stars with @xmath42 - 3.6 , likely belonging to the tp - agb phase . in paper",

    "<S> we present high - quality j , h and @xmath0 photometry of four small magellanic cloud stellar clusters with intermediate ages in the 17 gyr range ( namely ngc  339 , 361 , 416 and 419 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained deep color - magnitude diagrams to study the evolved sequences and providing a detailed census of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and carbon star populations in each cluster and their contribution to the total cluster light . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the @xmath15 - 7 gyr old clusters agb stars account for @xmath16% of the total light in @xmath0-band , carbon stars are lacking and rgb stars account for @xmath145% of the total bolometric luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> these empirical findings are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derived photometric metallicities computed by using the properties of the rgb and finding an iron content of [ fe / h]=  -1.18 , -1.08 , -0.99 and -0.96 dex for ngc  339 , 361 , 416 and 419 respectively . </S>"
