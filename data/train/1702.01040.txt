    "free - surface flows of lithium and other liquid metals are considered a promising plasma - facing `` first wall '' for a nuclear fusion reactor : liquid walls could protect the underlying solid walls from high heat and neutron fluxes @xcite , and have been shown to lead to cleaner @xcite and more stable plasmas @xcite .",
    "however , free - surface liquid metal ( lm ) layers will tend to be uneven @xcite as a result of non - uniform force fields , liquid metal instabilities and turbulence @xcite .",
    "uneven lm surfaces could enter in contact with the plasma , contaminate it , cool it , and possibly disrupt it , or they might expose the underlying solid wall to damage by heat and neutrons , and expose the plasma to a material with less benign erosion and wall recycling properties .",
    "this motivated our investigation of how to stabilize free - surface liquid metal flows .",
    "as reported in the present article , this could be achieved `` passively '' , thanks to the strong magnetic field naturally present in a magnetically confined fusion reactor , or `` actively '' , by applying an electrical current in the liquid metal .",
    "note that , in addition to the deliberately applied current - pattern , other currents will naturally be induced in the liquid metal , e.g.  due to rotating modes in the plasma , and additional current fluctuations could result from turbulence .",
    "these additional induced or fluctuating currents will be non - uniform and will change with time . as a result , the @xmath0 force - density will change , and adjustments of the applied current - pattern might be required , in feedback with multi - point measurements of liquid metal thickness .",
    "this is the subject of separate works @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we start by discussing potential applications of stabilized , free - surface lm flows outside of fusion ( sec.[secapplic ] ) . in sec.[secsetup ] we describe the experimental setup , including the electromagnetic induction pump and a tiltable `` tile '' where the otherwise ducted flow is `` free - surface '' and exposed to a magnetic field @xmath1 , but not to a plasma , yet .",
    "currents of density @xmath2 are also applied .",
    "passive stabilization by @xmath1 only and active stabilization by @xmath3 are reported respectively in sec.[secpass ] and [ secact ] , along with their interpretations .",
    "beside fusion - related uses , lm surface control has other scientific and industrial applications .",
    "controlling liquid metal flows can be of interest in metallurgy , for example to control a casting flow , to remove undesired droplets in laser- or plasma - cutting of metals or , on the contrary , to control and recover spills of precious materials , for economic reasons , or spills of toxic or unsafe materials , in order to protect public health and the environment .",
    "another area is furnaces .",
    "conventional refractory materials are solid , but no solid material exists , at atmospheric pressure , above the melting point ( 4215 k ) of tantalum hafnium carbide",
    ". however , several metals ( tantalum , tungsten , rhenium ) are liquid in the 4200 - 6200 k temperature range .",
    "a good control of these metals in their liquid phase would allow coating the inner walls of a furnace and operating it at unprecedented temperatures .",
    "this would open the way to high - temperature chemistry in normally inaccessible regimes where certain undesired reactions are disfavored and certain elusive reactions are favored @xcite , from which new processes and materials could result .    at the opposite end of the spectrum of `` heavy industry '' are two emerging `` high - tech '' applications of lms , which could benefit from passive , active or feedback stabilization .",
    "one technology is 3d metal printing @xcite .",
    "the other makes use of galinstan to realize flexible electronics , tunable metamaterials and microfluidic devices @xcite .",
    "both would benefit highly from flow control .",
    "finally , lms are used to generate large concave reflective surfaces in some optical telescopes @xcite : large containers filled with lms rotate , and the lm surface assumes a paraboloidal shape as a result",
    ". stabilization or , more generally , control , would `` polish ''",
    "the liquid mirror from small surface waves due to seismic vibrations .",
    "furthermore , feedback control @xcite could pave the way to more advanced uses of lm surfaces , including adaptive optics .",
    "this could be extended to transparent conducting fluids for refractive optics : `` liquid lenses '' already exist @xcite , but they can only be adjusted in focal length .",
    "also , they suffer from aberrations , which could be electromagnetically controlled .",
    "a galinstan flow was sustained by an induction pump consisting of a ferromagnetic rotor with permanent magnets mounted on it @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is partly `` frozen '' in the liquid metal surrounding the rotor .",
    "therefore , as the field rotates , the liquid metal rotates as well , although with a slip factor .",
    "this approach was preferred to conventional pumps , which would enter in electrical contact with the metal flow , and could be damaged by intense currents .",
    "a schematic and two cross - sections of the pump are shown in fig.[pump]a , b and d. the dimensions are : rotor radius @xmath4=9 cm , duct width @xmath5=7 cm , height of liquid metal channel @xmath6=3.5 mm , permanent magnets width and height , @xmath7=2.54",
    "cm and @xmath8=1.27 cm , angle between inlet and outlet @xmath9=30@xmath10 .        the maximum pressure @xmath11 developed by the pump can be written as a function of the electrical conductivity @xmath12 , the slipping factor @xmath13 between the rotor velocity @xmath14 and fluid velocity @xmath15 , the magnetic field @xmath16 , mean length @xmath17 of the mhd channel and negative transverse - end effect coefficient @xmath18 @xcite : @xmath19 this pressure is plotted in fig.[pressure_plot]a as a function of the flow rate , @xmath20 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the transverse sizes of the mhd channel in fig.[pump]d .",
    "the product @xmath21 , where @xmath11 and @xmath22 are related to each other as in fig.[pressure_plot]a , represents the minimum motor power to rotate the rotor at a certain angular frequency @xmath23 .",
    "this estimate , however , neglects ohmic losses in the lm , @xmath24 the motor power needed can ultimately be calculated as @xmath25 .",
    "fig.[pressure_plot]b illustrates the fluid velocities achievable by operating a motor of power @xmath26 at higher and higher @xmath27 .",
    "the initial prototype was nearly entirely realized in 3d - printed pla plastic , to which galinstan is not corrosive . with an electric 1 kw motor , it sustained galinstan flows of up to 30 @xmath28/s .",
    "3d - printing was rapid and inexpensive .",
    "however , for increased mechanical strength , the pump was eventually rebuilt in non - magnetic stainless steel , with an improved design ( fig.[new_pump ] ) .",
    "we started with a single block with a large bore closely fitting to the rotor .",
    "then , from one side of the block a computer - numeric - control ( cnc ) machine excavated a duct of uniform cross - sectional area but variable cross - sectional shape .",
    "the shape varied from a 69@xmath295 mm rectangle in proximity of the rotor , to take advantage of the strongest field , to 18.5@xmath2918.5 mm squares at the junctions with epdm rubber hoses of circular cross - section .",
    "finally , a cnc - machined lid ( in black in fig.[new_pump]b ) was welded on the block ( in gray ) to laterally seal the channel .    to increase @xmath16 and thus the pumping pressure @xmath11",
    ", ferromagnetic laminations were inserted in dedicated slots in the stator , concentric to the duct , at slightly outer radii ( fig.[new_pump]b ) .",
    "the lamination provided a low - reluctance path for the magnetic field lines through the mhd channel , which in turn increased @xmath11 proportionally to @xmath30 .",
    "the latter reduced the negative effect of losses due to eddy currents inside the body of the new metallic stator .",
    "the hydraulic circuit was mostly ducted , but comprised a 3d - printed plastic , 5@xmath2910 cm tile ( fig.[pump]c ) for free - surface flows , which typically are 0.5 - 1 cm thick .",
    "the tile was tiltable to simulate the floor , wall or ceiling of a fusion reactor , and orientations in between .",
    "it was mentioned above that , due to the lm not being a perfect conductor , the field is not perfectly `` frozen - in '' , and the lm flow slips with respect to the rotor .",
    "for this reason , it was important to calibrate the flow velocity @xmath15 as a function of the rotor velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the flow velocity was measured by particle velocimetry , by means of fast - camera videos aquired at 2000 frames per second , and by means of photos of exposure time @xmath31=0.5 - 2 ms . from the videos and photos it was possible to infer the speed of grains of dust and other natural impurities dragged by the lm , and",
    "assume that that was also the lm speed .",
    "the results of the calibration are summarized in fig.[figcalibr ] .",
    "the large error bars are due to measuring the non - uniform , time - evolving flow over several times and locations . on the other hand ,",
    "the very fact that the flow is uneven and not constant makes it well - suited for stabilization experiments .",
    "the tile shown in fig.[pump]c , with an approximately 5 mm thick layer of galinstan flowing at velocity @xmath32 , was placed in a transverse magnetic field @xmath16 .",
    "a scan of @xmath32 up to 0.6@xmath330.3 m / s and of @xmath16 up to 0.38 t provided the results shown in fig.[dc_field_effect ] . in the absence of magnetic field ,",
    "small amplitude perturbations are visible over the surface of the flow . by applying the magnetic field ,",
    "the velocity fluctuations are strongly damped .",
    "the electromagnetic force term in the navier - stokes equation    @xmath34    contains , through the generalized ohm s law    @xmath35    a stabilizing term @xmath36 of order @xmath37 .",
    "this term dominates over the non - linear convective term @xmath38 , of order @xmath39 : the ratio of the two , for @xmath16=0.4 t , @xmath40 = 0.2 m / s , @xmath41 = 0.1 and galinstan conductivity and density , evaluates approximately 44 .    in fact , the electromagnetic term also dominates over the viscous term @xmath42 : their ratio is the hartmann number @xmath43 , which in the case of interest is of order 7@xmath4410@xmath45 .    therefore , in the limit of no applied electric field and negligible displacement current , the navier - stokes equation simplifies as follows :    @xmath46    that is to say that motion is governed by @xmath47 ( basically , the pump ) , by gravity and by a term proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "the latter is clearly stabilizing : if we define the @xmath49 axis as the magnetic field direction , a fluctuation of velocity @xmath50 in the @xmath51 direction results in a current density fluctuation @xmath52 and hence in a force per unit volume @xmath53 .",
    "note that this force is proportional to @xmath50 and opposite to it , hence it acts as a viscous drag .",
    "also note that it scales like @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath54 direction @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , by incompressibility the volumetric strain rate evaluates @xmath56 . as a consequence , if @xmath50 and @xmath57 are kept small by stabilization , then @xmath58 is also small .",
    "= 35@xmath59 with respect to horizontal , for various velocities @xmath32 and transverse magnetic fields @xmath16 .",
    "the photos illustrate the stabilizing effect of a high @xmath16 , especially at high @xmath32 , when the stabilizing force ( scaling with @xmath32 ) is comparatively more important than surface tension ( independent from @xmath32).,scaledwidth=57.0% ]",
    "flat electrodes described elsewhere @xcite were used to apply currents longitudinal to the flow and thus apply * j*@xmath29*b * forces orthogonal to the substrate .",
    "[ jxb ] presents qualitative results obtained with galinstan flowing in the presence of @xmath16=0.38 t and @xmath60=0 - 120 a at 0.6@xmath330.3 m / s .",
    "shown are nine images of the 5 cm wide free - surface flow , acquired for increasing values of @xmath60 and @xmath16 .    in the ducted part of the tile ,",
    "the lm flow has rectangular cross - section .",
    "however , in the free - surface part of the tile , with the constraints of one wall now removed , the cross - section of the flow is free to change .",
    "indeed , it does change in fig.[jxb ] , as a consequence of surface - tension trying to minimize the outer surface .",
    "in addition , gravity accelerates the flow and reduces its cross - section . in a reactor",
    "these effects would leave part of the solid wall and the plasma exposed to each other .",
    "it is reassuring , though , that when a sufficient lorentz force is applied in the normal direction , the flow flattens and covers the tile nearly entirely ( fig.[jxb]i ) or entirely ( fig.[jxb_old]c ) .",
    "full - coverage depends on velocity and inclination , and can sometimes be obtained at reduced @xmath0 ( fig.[jxb_old]c ) .    in summary , a liquid metal flow in the presence of a dc magnetic field",
    "is stabilized if sufficiently intense transverse currents are applied .",

    "the resulting undesired forces call for the need to adjust the applied @xmath2 in real time , in feedback with local lm thickness measurements @xcite .",
    "one such situation might occur when rotating instabilities -and the associated rotating helical field @xmath1- are present in the plasma , inducing a helical @xmath2 in the lm . a toy model of this phenomenon",
    "is easily reproduced in the laboratory by means of the rotating permanent magnets featured in the pump ( fig.[toy ] ) .",
    "a further motivation for feedback stems from the fact that the forces applied to the lm and pointing outward will never be perfectly uniform .",
    "the lm would thus be rayleigh - taylor unstable , similar to a pellet subject to inward - pointing forces in inertial confinement fusion @xcite .",
    "several other situations requiring feedback control were discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "results were presented about the electromagnetic stabilization of a free - surface flow of galinstan .",
    "the flow was sustained by a rotating permanent magnet induction pump .",
    "strong transverse magnetic fields @xmath1 were found to stabilize the flow .",
    "this was due to the velocity fluctuations perpendicular to @xmath1 causing a fluctuation of @xmath2 , through generalized ohm s law .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 force - density , scaling like @xmath30 , opposes the original velocity fluctuation .",
    "parallel fluctuations are also small , as a result of incompressibility .    the external application of an additional , sufficiently high @xmath2 orthogonal to @xmath1 and parallel to the liquid metal layer resulted in @xmath63 forces .",
