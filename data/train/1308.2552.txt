    "the same number of scatterers with the same value of @xmath128 have weaker effect when they are placed in the region where the soi oscillates .",
    "that is , although spin - dependent random scattering decreases the degree of polarization independently from the position of the scatterers , when this process takes place inside the region with oscillating soi , spin - polarization still can build up , at least partially .",
    "this effect can be understood qualitatively : the spin - polarization at the output is stronger when the `` interaction region '' ( where the soi oscillates and polarization is generated ) is longer ( with all other parameters being the same ) . when the spin coherence length decreases below the extension of this region , it defines a new , effective length along which polarization is generated .",
    "thus , realistically , in a sample with long interaction region and disorder , it is the spin coherence length that determines the degree of polarization right at the output , and this is also the length scale that tells us the distance below which the spin - polarized electron waves can be detected in the output lead .",
    "the results of this subsection show that the polarization effect we described earlier in this paper is not extremely sensitive to scattering induced decoherence , thus its experimental observation can be possible .",
    "in the current paper we investigated spin - dependent quantum transport through devices in which the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) is time dependent , more precisely , it oscillates . by considering a monoenergetic input ,",

    "additionally , it was demonstrated that simple geometries can produce spin - polarized wave packets even for completely unpolarized input . according to our calculation ,",
    "this dynamical spin polarization effect appears for realistic , experimentally achievable parameter ranges and remains observable when moderately intensive scattering processes are also taken into account .    in other words ,",
