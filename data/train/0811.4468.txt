    "is how the cell determines a strategy to best select a specific target from many ?",
    "this problem arises for many chemotactic organisms , such as _ e. coli _",

    "@xcite , and _ dictyostelium discoideum _",
    "@xcite , and poses a challenging theoretical question .    here",
    ", we propose a biologically plausible mechanism involving active sensing , in which chemical signaling is initiated by a chemical prompt from the chemotactic cell .",
    "potential biological manifestations of active sensing include `` diffusion sensing '' @xcite and cancer cell chemotaxis  @xcite .",
    "diffusion sensing is a particular variant of quorum sensing that involves release of a metabolically inexpensive compound , inducing nearby cells to emit the main signal back to the first cell indicating to it that that other chemically responsive targets are in the vicinity  @xcite .",
    "cancer cells also exploit this type of indirect sensing by producing excess amounts of matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) which cleave substrates ( such as growth factors and laminins ) bound to the extracellular matrix ( ecm )  @xcite .",
    "these cleavage products diffuse back to the cancer cells , inducing their chemotaxis .",
    "dynamic multistep chemotaxis mechanisms may also arise in the mating of yeast , where each sex of yeast emits its own pheromone that up - regulates gene expression of the complementary pheromone in the opposite sex  @xcite .    in our model of active",
    "sensing , moving chemical sources and targets interact through the time - dependent diffusion of signaling molecules therefore , the timing of the release and detection of chemoattractants will also be important in the overall chemotactic process @xcite . indeed , there is evidence that the probe emission of mmp s is transcriptionally regulated and is time - dependent  @xcite .",
    "experiments have also demonstrated the existence of robust and tunable oscillations in transcription in _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite and mammalian cells @xcite , and camp release in _ dictyostelium discoideum _ @xcite .",
    "another important virtue of the proposed dynamic sensing mechanism is that it allows cells to detect local , transient chemoattractant gradients in complex media where steady - state gradients can not be sustained .",
    "for example , branched , `` dead - end '' volumes with impenetrable boundaries can not support a steady - state chemical gradient , but can allow a transient gradient .",
    "therefore , chemotaxis under time - dependent , and in particular , time periodic conditions are realizable systems for further exploration .",
    "basic models for these potentially novel time - periodic chemotactic systems are currently lacking . here , we distill the extracellular components of a dynamic multistep chemotaxis mechanism into an essential physical model that describes gradient - guided cellular motion towards chemically responsive targets .",
    "classic chemotaxis models by keller and segel  @xcite , and their extensions  @xcite consider passive sources of a chemoattractant to which a cell responds , or consumption of a passive chemical @xcite .",
    "contrary to the classic model of chemotaxis where the cell moves along a static chemical gradient of nutrients already present in the environment , we consider the following scenario .",
    "initially , a cell sends out a chemical probe signal ( species @xmath0 ) , which diffuses to stationary targets . upon contact with the targets ,",

    "pulsed release causes the cell to quickly go towards the near target , but a subsequent wave of chemoattractant from the far target caused the cell to ultimately select the far target . in two dimensions , the radial divergence of the concentration fields renders the signal from the far target insufficient to pull the cell from the weaker target . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the radial spread is stronger , and the frequency and @xmath33-dependent selection mechanism is significantly mitigated .",
    "while nontrivial target selection phenomena still arises in @xmath62 , many cellular chemotactic responses , such as development , occur in @xmath73 where the concentration fields spread significantly and attenuate signalling responses .",

    "a common biological example is the extracellular cellular matrix and the existence of intervening cells and tissues .",

    "therefore , signatures of our proposed mechanism may nonetheless arise in @xmath73 .    although our results are based on a simplified model of response ( eq . [ rdot1 ] ) where @xmath136 \\propto n_{b}(\\r , t)$ ] , and neglect noise of memory effects in @xmath33 , they provide clues into how more complex models might behave .",
    "for example , in the limit of a motility response that requires highly cooperative binding of multiple chemoattractants ( large hill coefficient @xmath32 ) , the motion of the cell would be appreciable only when a very narrow range of gradients in @xmath7 cross the cell .",
    "high cooperativity imposes a switching response which would lead to saltatory movements of the cell . while larger velocities can be attained ( because @xmath137 $ ] can be larger is @xmath32 is large ) the time scale over which @xmath138 $ ] is large is short .",
    "we expect the net effect to be quantitative and that most our qualitative results will persist",
    ".    delayed response , or directional memory , may arise from receptor adaptation and other intermediate steps in the cell signaling pathway @xcite , and may give rise to behavior that is more difficult to intuit without numerical computations .",
    "however , simple conclusions in certain limits can be motivated by comparing the delay time , or directional correlation time with the arrival times of the gradients @xmath137 $ ] from the targets .",
    "for example , if directional memory is longer than the difference in times it takes for the @xmath7 signal to propagate from the close and far targets , the cell would be less sensitive to the signal from the far target .",
    "this would have the effect of biasing selection of the near target , provided the release frequency is sufficiently high .",
    "one example of a biologically - motivated variant of our model worth further discussion is `` autocrine '' signalling .",
    "autocrine signalling is often relevant to bacterial aggregation , where the probe is identical to the chemoattractant ( @xmath139 ) . within our mathematical framework ,",
    "the autocrine mechanism is described by replacing @xmath6 with @xmath5 in eqs .",
    "[ diffb ] and [ rdot1 ] , and setting @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this model is also novel in that its naive continuum limit does not map onto existing pde descriptions such as keller - segel type models . in the keller - segel model ,",
    "the production of autocrine chemoattractant is simply proportional to the local cell density and is independent of the probing signal the cells receive .",
    "our qualitative results for paracrine signalling also hold in the autocrine signalling problem , which can be understood by considering the @xmath8 profile generated by the cell and that generated by the target . in the autocrine case ,",
    "when the cell responds to @xmath8 , its self - produced @xmath8 field is maximal near the point where it is released .",
    "therefore , the self - produced @xmath8 tends to keep the cell from moving .",
    "when the gradient in @xmath8 generated from the target is finally felt , the cell will move towards the target ; however , typically by this time , the self - generated @xmath8 has diffused and/or dissipated away such that it s `` restoring force '' is weak .",
    "therefore , we expect that all else being equal , the replacement of @xmath7 by @xmath8 , leads to an overall slightly suppressed chemotactic response .",
    "finally , analysis of the effects of stochastic responses , implemented through additive brownian terms to eq .",
    "[ rdot ] or [ rdot1 ] , or through a time random response coefficient @xmath36 , is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "however , it has been shown that in a two - dimensional autocrine mechanism , stochastic effects and chemical decay keep the cells diffusive  @xcite , despite the tendency for all cells and targets to aggregate .",
    "therefore , one might expect that target selection to be suppressed in the presence of sufficient noise .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a model for dynamic , multistep chemotaxis that involves chemical communication between cell and targets .",
    "our analysis shows that signalling agents can select among potential targets by controlling the amount of , and frequency at which probe chemical is released . since our moving source problem is intrinsically nonlinear , we employed numerical calculations to provide evidence of a critical target - switching release amplitude , as well as a window of response strengths @xmath33 within which a cell chooses the nearer , weaker target over the farther , stronger target that is selected outside this window .",
    "this effect arises from a nonlinear interplay between diffusion , decay , and chemoattractant production and depends on the frequency of release .",
    "moreover , we found that for the conditions studied , a constant probe release leads to acquisition of the weaker , nearer target , while low frequency spike release leads to acquisition of the stronger , farther target . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the cell again approaches the weaker , nearer target since high frequency and constant release give rise to similar spatial - temporal probe distributions due to the averaging nature of the underlying diffusive physics .",
    "our numerical experiments have shown that target selection is observed over a wide range of system parameters , suggesting the chemolocation mechanism may be common in nature .",
    "numerous variants of our basic model , such as mobile targets that sense probe chemical , stochastic effects , and delays in the signaling processes can be straightforwardly investigated . in the present work",
    ", we assumed the simplest deterministic , instantaneous response in order to avoid introducing excessive number of parameters .",
    "nonetheless , we have argued that many extensions of our underlying model , except sufficiently large noise , are likely to qualitatively preserve the predicted results .",
