    "polarized interacting electrons in the lowest landau level in the tao - thouless limit , which corresponds to a thin torus or cylinder , has been a subject of recent study , see _ eg _ ref . .",
    "in this limit the problem becomes equivalent to a one - dimensional lattice model with a purely electrostatic repulsive interaction between the electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized for any filling factor @xmath0 and the energy eigenstates are the states where the electrons have fixed positions on the lattice@xcite . in the ground state , the tao - thouless state ,",
    "the electrons are as far separated as possible ; the state has a unit cell with @xmath3 electrons on @xmath4 sites and is @xmath4-fold degenerate .",
    "there is a gap to all excitations and the low energy charged excitations are domain walls between the degenerate ground states ; these domain walls have charge @xmath5 .",
    "the tao - thouless states , and their excitations , are limits of hierarchy wave functions describing abelian quantum hall states and there is strong evidence that they develop adiabatically into such states as the circumference of the torus increases in cases where such states are observed .",
    "the hierarchy construction of quantum hall states is manifest in the tt - limit : each state is obtained by condensing quasiparticles , _ ie _ domain walls , in a parent state@xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "the tt - states are abelian quantum hall states .    in this article",
    "we consider the low - energy excitations in the tt - limit in general . it was previously noted that the unit cell @xmath6 for the tt qround state can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quasielectron and @xmath9 is the quasihole excitation @xcite .",
    "thus the ground state is a string @xmath10 .",
    "interchanging a nearest neighbor particle and hole gives @xmath11 .",
    "this state has two nearby domain walls , @xmath12 and @xmath13these are the quasiparticles with charges @xmath5 . here",
    "we show that , given a certain condition on the electron - electron interaction , the low - energy sector of states consists of all reorderings of the @xmath8 s and @xmath9 s that make up the ground state .",
    "we study how the low - energy states develop away from the tt - limit using exact diagonalisation at and around @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the low energy sector for any circumference consists of states that develop from the low energy states in the tt - limit .",
    "the exclusion statistics @xcite was determined for @xmath1 in the tt - limit in ref . .",
    "we here generalize this to arbitrary filling factor @xmath0 and find a simple result for the exclusion statistics , which , however , in general differs from the values established for the excitations in the physical regime@xcite .",
    "in particular it disagrees in certain cases with the values obtained by assuming the quasiparticles are anyons and counting anyon wave functions .",
    "for example , at filling factors 1/3 and 2/5 the diagonal statistics in the tt - limit agrees with that in the physical regime for the holes but differs for the particles .",
    "we study numerically for these filling factors how the exclusion statistics for the quasiparticles change as the circumference increases and the values that are consistent with the particles being anyons are recovered .",
    "a recent discussion of exclusion statistics in connection to entanglement spectra can be found in ref .",
    ", see also ref . .",
    "the quasiparticles in the tt - limit are domain walls and as a consequence the exchange statistics can not be calculated in this limit@xcite .",
    "however , the exchange statistics can be considered by making use of the tt - limit and invoking the adiabatic continuity to the bulk quasiparticles@xcite .    in sec .",

    "we consider a single landau level of spin polarized electrons on a torus with lengths @xmath15 .",
    "using landau gauge , the natural one - particle eigenstates @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are gaussians concentrated along circles around the torus ( in the @xmath18-direction say , @xmath19 is the momentum in this direction ) .",
    "this maps the landau level onto a one - dimensional lattice model with @xmath20 sites numbered by @xmath19 , where each site is either empty or occupied by an electron .",
    "the lattice constant is @xmath21 in units of the magnetic length @xmath22 .",
    "a basis of many - particle states is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the number of electrons ; the filling factor is @xmath26 . since the position @xmath19 gives the conserved momentum",
    ", it follows that a general translationally invariant two - body hamiltonian consists of all terms where two electrons hop while preserving the position of their center of mass .",
    "let @xmath27 be the amplitude for this process when the separations between the electrons are @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 , the lattice constant goes to infinity and the overlap between the single - particle states with different @xmath19 vanishes . as a consequence ,",
    "only the electrostatic terms @xmath30 remain .",
    "this is the thin torus , or tao - thouless , limit .",
    "it should be noted that one can think of this limit as simply being a change of the hamiltonian , _ ie _ the @xmath27 , while keeping the configuration space unchanged .",
    "thus the tt - limit does describe a two - dimensional qh system , albeit with a peculiar anisotropic interaction .",
    "in the tt - limit the interacting electron problem can be solved exactly since the interaction is purely electrostatic : the energy eigenstates are simply the states @xmath23 . for an interaction that obeys the concavity condition @xmath31 , the ground state and the low energy excitations",

    "there is strong evidence that the tt - ground state , given by at @xmath0 , @xmath4 odd , is adiabatically connected to the standard ground state that describes an abelian qh state for a realistic interaction .",
    "we claim that the tt - states ( [ relaxation ] ) are abelian qauntum hall states .",
    "the hierarchy construction of qh states is proven in the tt - limit : each tt - ground state is a condensate of quasiparticles in another parent tt - ground state .",
    "the unit cell @xmath41 can be represented in @xmath4 different ways by translating the cell ( imposing periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "transposing the cell gives a cell that is a translation of the original one .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a standard representation @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) which is the cell where the electrons are as far to the right ( left ) as possibile , _",
    "ie _ the cell with the maximal ( minimal ) value of @xmath44 .",
    "the ground state unit cell at @xmath0 can be written as @xmath45 , see [ app : ph - properties ] , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the quasihole and quasielectron with charges @xmath5 . when inserting @xmath47 or @xmath46 between two unit cells in the ground state they produce domain walls with charges @xmath48 .",
    "the number of sites , @xmath49 , and the number of electrons , @xmath50 , in the quasiparticles are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 ; throughout the article we use @xmath53 and @xmath8 interchangeably to denote the quasielectrons ( and @xmath54 and @xmath9 to denote the quasiholes ) .",

    "for example , for @xmath1 , 2/5 , 4/11 and 5/13 one finds @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "moreover , due to the hierarchical structure , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are themselves the unit cells at @xmath64 .",

    "these results obtained for @xmath93 and @xmath94 generalize to arbitrary filling factor and will be crucial in identifying the low energy excitations .",
    "we show in [ app : ph - properties ] that in the unit cell @xmath77 that gives the ground state at @xmath95 ( _ ie _ the unit cell that is given by ( [ relaxation ] ) ) there are precisely two electrons with the property that moving one of them one step ( to the left for the one to the left and to the right for the one to the right ) interchanges a nearest neighbor @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the string of @xmath79 that make up the ground state ; moving the left electron gives @xmath80 whereas moving the right leads to @xmath80 .",
    "( the first acts within a unit cell @xmath96 , whereas the second acts within a translated unit cell . )",
    "furthermore , the energy of these excitations is of the order of @xmath97 ; we denote this by @xmath98 , and it is the minimum energy excitation of the system ( except for the zero energy excitations that translate the whole system giving one of the degenerate ground states ) .",
    "all other excitations are of order @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "( we assume @xmath101 , in the tt - limit , see below . )",
    "we assume that @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( just as @xmath79 ) are given in the @xmath70-representation ; this makes the identification of a certain state given in the @xmath102 notation as a @xmath103 state unique .",
    "note that interchanging a nearest neighbor @xmath9 and @xmath8 in the ground state , which is a string of @xmath104 , corresponds to creating two domain walls , @xmath105 and @xmath13 with charges @xmath5 , next to each other  this is a minimally separated particle - hole pair , which is a natural minimum energy excitation .",
    "for @xmath106 the above still holds with the exception that there is now one electron per unit cell that can be moved both to the right and to the left leading to an interchange of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "any interchange @xmath107 , wherever it takes place in an arbitrary string of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , is obtained by a minimum energy hop @xmath108 with energy of order @xmath109 as described above .",
    "this follows since @xmath110 differ in energy by @xmath97 ; whereas @xmath111 and @xmath112 differ in energy by @xmath113 .",
    "the last statement can be understood by noting that the two states are degenerate if the surrounding elements are symmetric around @xmath114 .",
    "the energy difference is brought about by any antisymmetry @xmath19 sites away . for a proof of these results , see [ app : ph - proofs ] .",
    "if @xmath115 , for all @xmath19 , then we can identify the low - energy sector as consisting of states that can be described using only @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , several comments are in order . first , taking the limit of a standard interaction this condition may not be satisfied .",
    "it holds for a screened coulomb interaction , @xmath116 ( periodized over the torus ) but not for the unscreened case , @xmath117 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5_17_yuk ] below .",
    "( because of the periodization in the @xmath118direction , the interaction in the tt - limit , @xmath119 , becomes the electrostatic interaction between two homogeneously charged parallel lines , giving @xmath120 for the unscreened coulomb case and @xmath121 for the screened case , where @xmath122 is some non - exponential function . )",
    "what one finds quite generally though is that @xmath123 .",
    "second , while the specific form of the interaction in the physical regime is well - defined , this is not the case in the tt - limit ",
    "one may simply modify the interaction in this limit so that the condition is fulfilled .",
    "third , even if @xmath115 it may be that a sufficiently large number of @xmath8 , @xmath9 excitations has a higher energy than the lowest energy states that are not of this type . bearing the provisos above in mind , we identify the low - energy sector as consisting of states that can be described using only @xmath9 and @xmath8 . one further argument for this is of course that it is in accord with the expectation in the physical regime . as shown in [ app : ph - proofs ] these states  and no others  differ in energy compared to the ground state by @xmath124 .    as an illustrative aside we consider the hierarchy construction of 5/13 . since @xmath125 it follows that 5/13 is obtained by starting from the laughlin state at 1/3 and condensing quasielectrons to obtain 2/5 ; condensing quasiholes in 2/5 then gives 5/13 . in the tt - limit",
    ", the 1/3 ground state is 001 and @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",

    "red lines mark the very lowest states in the tt - limit , where they are identified in terms of particle and/or hole excitations of the ground state .",
