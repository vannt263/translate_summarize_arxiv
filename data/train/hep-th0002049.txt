    "the casimir effect has in recent years attracted considerable interest . for reviews on this topic see , for example , plunien _ _ et al.__@xcite , mostepanenko and trunov@xcite , and milton @xcite .",
    "the problem has been rather difficult to solve , once curved boundaries are present , because of divergences in the formalism and insufficient contact with experiments . in this paper",
    "we will consider a compact ball of radius a , permittivity @xmath4 and permeability @xmath5 , situated in an infinite medium whose corresponding material constants are @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ".    we shall take @xmath8 [ 1 ] so that the photon velocity is everywhere equal to @xmath9 .",
    "the relativistic condition ( 1 ) was , in the context of the casimir effect , to our knowledge first introduced by brevik and kolbenstvedt @xcite .",
    "the reason why this particular condition was imposed was that when calculating the casimir surface force density on the sphere , in this paper called @xmath10 , one avoids thereby the subtraction of a contact term : the contact term turns out to be zero just as in the case of a singular spherical conducting sphere in a vacuum @xcite .",
    "later , this kind of medium has been considered from various viewpoints [ 7 - 19 ] .",
    "a common feature of most of these papers is the use of macroscopic electrodynamics of continuous media .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to consider the casimir effect for a compact ball satisfying the condition ( 1 ) , at finite temperatures .",
    "finite temperature casimir theory has been considered previously by several authors , e.g. , lifshitz @xcite , fierz @xcite , sauer @xcite , mehra @xcite , brown and maclay @xcite , milton _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , revzen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and klich @xcite .",
    "also the very recent extensive treatise of feinberg _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ought to be mentioned , since it describes in detail the characteristic properties of the high temperature limit , and contains also an extensive reference list .",
    "we start in the next section by considering , as a first step , the @xmath11 theory , and demonstrate the equivalence between the green function method and the mode summation method .",
    "the equivalence has of course to hold if the theory is to make sense physically , but the equivalence is not so easy to see by a mere inspection of the mathematics .",
    "a detailed calculation is desirable . in section 3",
    "we generalize the casimir energy expression obtained in @xcite to the fourth order in the diluteness parameter @xmath12 ; cf .",
    "( 15 ) and the definition in eq .",
    "( 7 ) . in section 4",
    "we consider the casimir free energy @xmath13 at finite @xmath14 , emphasizing the difference between @xmath13 and the casimir energy @xmath15 , and give an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath13 in the case of a dilute medium endowed with a `` square '' dispersion relation implying a sharp high frequence cutoff at imaginary frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the presence of a dispersion - induced strong , negative , cutoff - dependent contribution to the casimir energy ( or free energy , for finite @xmath14 ) , seems first to have been pointed out by candelas @xcite , for the case of a perfectly conducting shell .    at high temperatures we find @xmath13 to be negative , decreasing linearly with @xmath14",
    "this agrees with results found previously in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy @xmath15 itself tends to zero at high temperatures .",
    "in this section we consider first the casimir surface force density @xmath10 at zero temperature , for a nondispersive medium .",
    "there are in principle two different methods for calculating @xmath10 ( more precisely , the part of @xmath10 that is independent of the high frequency cutoff ) :    the first method is to make use of the green functions .",
    "there are two scalar green functions , corresponding to two different electromagnetic modes .",
    "again , this method can be carried out in one of two different ways :    1 .",
    "first , one can evaluate @xmath10 as the difference between the radial maxwell stress tensor components on the outside and inside of the surface @xmath17 .",
    "we have to subtract off the volume terms in the scalar green functions , so that only the boundary dependent terms are left .",
    "this regularization ensures that the surface force goes to zero when @xmath18 , which is as we expect on physical grounds .",
    "also , this regularization permits us to calculate the casimir energy @xmath19 once @xmath10 is known , by the formula @xmath20 .",
    "( at @xmath11 , @xmath19 is the same as the free energy @xmath21 . ) 2 .",
    "alternatively , one can calculate the energy @xmath19 by integrating the maxwell energy density over the volume , retaining , as above , only the boundary dependent terms in the green functions .",
    "the outcome of these two approaches are of course in agreement .",
    "the green function method was first employed by milton , for the case of an ordinary dielectric ball @xcite , and was later applied to the case of an @xmath1 ball in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the result of the calculation can be given as follows .",
    "after a complex frequency rotation @xmath22 we can express all physical quantities as integrals over frequencies @xmath23 along the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "the cutoff dependence is omitted ( it disappears in the regularization procedure ) .",
    "we define riccati - bessel functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 by ( @xmath26 @xmath27 [ 2 ] corresponding to the wronskian @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are modified bessel functions .",
    "we introduce two dispersion functions @xmath32and @xmath33corresponding to the te and tm modes : @xmath34 [ 4 ]    the casimir energy as derived in @xcite on the basis of the green function can be written as @xmath35'.\\ ] ] [ 5 ] here @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; the time difference @xmath38 has been euclidean rotated , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the time - splitting parameter .",
    "moreover , we have defined the function @xmath41 as @xmath42'$ ] [ in ref @xcite we used the symbols @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; the relations between these quantities and those defined by ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are @xmath45 and @xmath46 . ]",
    "consider next the second method , which consists in summing over the modes by means of contour integration .",
    "this method was recently used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is in turn based on the technique developed by lambiase and nesterenko @xcite and nesterenko and pirozhenko @xcite .",
    "one gets ( when we supply the same parameter @xmath47 as above ) @xmath48.\\ ] ] [ 6 ] introducing the parameter @xmath12 by @xmath49 [ 7 ] the expression ( 6 ) can alternatively be written as @xmath50.\\ ] ] [ 8 ]    the two methods thus lead to two expressions for the casimir energy , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "the expressions , of course , have to be equal , but to see the equality is not quite trivial by mere inspection .",
    "the equality is tantamount to the equality @xmath51'=",
    "-\\frac{(\\mu_1-\\mu_2)^2}{4\\mu_1\\mu_2 } \\left[\\lambda_l^2(x)\\right]'.\\ ] ] [ 9 ]    now it turns out that this equality is not so difficult to prove after all if we insert the expressions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) on the left hand side and take into account the above mentioned wronskian between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "actually , the expression ( 6 ) was also made use of in the green - function calculation of milton and ng @xcite .",
    "before leaving the zero temperature theory let us make a brief remark on the nondispersive dilute ball , meaning that @xmath52 [ 10 ]    the most practical expression to make use of for the casimir energy , is that of eq.([eq:8 ] ) .",
    "we expand the logarithm to fourth order in @xmath12 : @xmath53 [ 11 ] and make the following steps :    1 .",
    "put @xmath54 ; 2 .   perform a partial integration in eq.(8 ) ; 3 .",
    "interchange summation and integration signs .",
    "then , omitting the @xmath55 terms in ( [ eq:11 ] ) , @xmath56 [ 12 ] which can be processed further using the uniform asymptotic expansion for @xmath24 and @xmath25 up to @xmath57 , in the same way as in refs .",
    "there is one single divergent term in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , which can be regularized by means of the riemann zeta function , @xmath58 .",
    "the only formula needed in practice is @xmath59 [ 13 ]    moreover , we use the summations @xmath60 ,   @xmath61 , as well as the integral @xmath62 [ 14 ] ( @xmath63 is the beta function ) , to get @xmath64\\\\ & -\\frac{63 \\xi^4}{16384 a } \\left[\\left(\\half\\pi^2 - 4\\right)-\\frac{351}{1792}\\left(\\frac { 1 } { 6}\\pi^4 -16 \\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] [ 15 ]    this expression generalizes that of equation ( 3.10 ) in @xcite up to the fourth order in @xmath12 .",
    "numerically , the expressions between square parentheses in ( 15 ) are respectively 1.05966 and 0.88880 . the fourth order contribution to the casimir energy",
    "is thus weak and negative , corresponding to an attractive force component .    in connection with this calculation",
    ", we wish to emphasise two points .",
    "first , we may avoid the time - splitting parameter @xmath47 from the beginning , using zeta function regularization ( here the riemann function ) instead .",
    "secondly , the convergence parameter @xmath65 that was for mathematical reasons introduced in @xcite , can simply be omitted . at least from a pragmatic point of view",
    ", the nondispersive medium becomes quite simple .",
    "we now take into account dispersive properties of the two media , meaning that @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "we shall still assume that @xmath68 , so that the velocity of photons in either medium is equal to the velocity of light .",
    "after frequency rotation , along the imaginary frequency axis , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "some care ought to be taken when considering the dispersive formalism , since frequency derivatives of the material constants are no longer ignorable straightaway .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath11 total zero - point energy , which we shall call @xmath71 , of the inner ( i ) and the outer ( ii ) regions .",
    "this energy is simply given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , which we repeat here with a slightly generalized notation : @xmath72.\\ ] ] [ 16 ] the reason for this equality is that the two dispersion functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as given by the dispersive generalization of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , retain their physical meaning also in the presence of dispersion .",
    "thus the te and tm modes are still determined by @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . the expression ( 16 )",
    "needs to be regularized : we subtract off the zero - point energy @xmath77 corresponding to the limit @xmath78 ; cf . @xcite . as @xmath79 and @xmath80 for large @xmath81",
    ", we get from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) @xmath82 [ 17 ] the casimir energy @xmath83 becomes accordingly , at @xmath11 , @xmath84.\\ ] ] [ 18 ] observing that @xmath85 , @xmath86 we find ( when reverting to the notation @xmath87 instead of @xmath88 ) that @xmath89,\\ ] ] [ 19 ] which finally means that , at @xmath11 , @xmath90.\\ ] ] [ 20 ] it is rather remarkable that this simple formula continues to hold even in the presence of arbitrary frequency dispersion . since dispersion implies that we introduce a physically based high frequency cutoff , we expect that there is no longer any need for a time splitting parameter .",
    "we have therefore put @xmath54 in the expression ( 20 ) .",
    "we will henceforth restrict ourselves to the first ( i. e. , the second order ) term in the expansion ( 11 ) .    in this section",
    "we adopt the simplest imaginable dispersion relation ( a `` square '' form ) : we let the inner medium ( a ball ) correspond to @xmath91 [ 21 ] whereas the outer medium is a vacuum .",
    "it is to be noted here that the general thermodynamic law saying that the susceptibility has to decrease monotonically along the positive imaginary frequency axis @xcite , is satisfied by this curve for @xmath92 if it is given a small negative slope for @xmath93 .",
    "we still assume dilute media , @xmath94 , as above .",
    "consider now the case of finite temperatures .",
    "since the thermal green function is periodic in imaginary time , we can replace the fourier transform in the @xmath11 theory with fourier series in imaginary time .",
    "the transition to finite temperature theory is accomplished by means of a discretization of the frequencies , @xmath95 [ 22 ] where @xmath96 is an integer and @xmath97 ( we put @xmath98 ) .",
    "the rule for going from frequency integral to sum over matsubara frequencies is @xmath99 [ 23 ] here @xmath100 is a nondimensional temperature , and the prime on the summation sign in ( 23 ) means that the @xmath101 term is counted with half weight .",
    "since @xmath102 can be written as @xmath103 , we can express the casimir free energy at finite temperatures as @xmath104 [ 24 ] to @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding zero temperature expression , still to be called @xmath19 , is given by the first term to the right in eq .",
    "( 12 ) .",
    "the following delicate point ought to be noted . we know that the mean energy per mode of the electromagnetic field is @xmath106 .",
    "the function @xmath107 is to replace @xmath108 , when we construct the general contour integral for the casimir energy @xmath15 at finite temperatures .",
    "it is the function @xmath109 which is responsible for the occurrence of the matsubara frequencies along the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "now , our formalism implies morover a transition from the energy @xmath15 to the free energy @xmath13 .",
    "this is accomplished by means of a partial integration , making use of the relations @xmath110 for this reason we have changed the energy symbol from e to @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 24 ) . at @xmath11 , obviously @xmath111 .",
    "we thank i. klich ( personal communication ) for helpful comments regarding this point .",
    "let us in this context also recall how the surface force density @xmath10 is calculated . generally ,",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , @xmath10 can be found as the difference between the radial maxwell stress tensor components on the outside and inside of the surface @xmath17 .",
    "the stress components are in turn constructed from the two - point functions like @xmath112 when @xmath113 and @xmath114 are close together , at a given temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the appropriate energy function is found by integrating @xmath115 over @xmath0 , from initial position @xmath116 , to the final position where the radius of the sphere terminates at the fixed value @xmath0 .",
    "this process is to take place at constant temperature .",
    "the appropriate energy function is accordingly the _ free energy",
    "_ @xmath13 .",
    "thus we see that , whereas in force considerations at finite temperatures one is lead naturally to the free energy , while starting from energy considerations one has instead to make use of thermodynamical considerations to calculate @xmath13 .",
    "mathematically , the case @xmath101 requires special attention . for this purpose",
    "we observe the approximate expression for @xmath24 and @xmath25 at low @xmath81 : @xmath117 [ 25 ]    from this it follows that @xmath118 , @xmath119 , implying that the contribution to ( 24 ) from @xmath101 is @xmath120 [ 26 ]    we add the contribution from @xmath121 , restricting ourselves to the dominant term in the uniform asymptotic expansion of @xmath122 @xcite : @xmath123 .\\ ] ] [ 27 ] thereby @xmath124.\\ ] ] [ 28 ]    we have here truncated the sum over @xmath125 at @xmath126 in order to avoid divergences .",
    "it is easy to give an order - of - magnitude estimate of @xmath127 : our dispersion relation ( 21 ) implies that photons having frequencies @xmath128 higher than @xmath129 do not `` see '' the sphere at all .",
    "a photon of limiting frequency @xmath129 just touching the surface of the sphere has an angular momentum equal to @xmath130 .",
    "this type of argument has repeatedly been used in casimir calculations @xcite .",
    "one might put @xmath131 where @xmath9 is a coefficient of order unity .",
    "however , in view if simplicity , and since we are able to give only an estimate of the order of magnitude anyhow , we put henceforth @xmath132 .",
    "as upper limit in the summation we thus take @xmath133 [ 29 ]    now taking into account the exact summation formula derived in eq.(a3 ) in @xcite ( with @xmath134 an arbitrary constant ) : @xmath135 [ 30 ] we can write eq . ( 28 ) as @xmath136;\\ ] ] [ 31 ] the first term on the right hand side of ( 30 ) drops out .",
    "this expression can be calculated , with @xmath137 as an input parameter , to show how @xmath13 varies with @xmath100 .",
    "it is of interest first to examine the case of low temperatures .",
    "let us assume that @xmath138 [ 32 ] implying that @xmath139 .",
    "then the first term in ( 31 ) dominates , and can be replaced by unity .",
    "we obtain approximately @xmath140 [ 33 ]    this negative expression establishes a constant low - temperature plateau for the casimir free energy .",
    "it is of interest to compare this result with that obtained from the slightly more complicated though physically more realistic lorentz ( or sellmeir ) dispersion relation . the latter , when taken only along the imaginary frequency axis , can be written as @xmath141 [ 34 ] where @xmath142 is the zero frequency magnetic susceptibility .",
    "( the damping term is omitted . ) here @xmath143 represents a `` soft '' cutoff .",
    "this case was considered in @xcite , for the zero - temperature case . for a dilute medium , @xmath144 , the result of the calculation in @xcite",
    "can be written @xmath145 [ 35 ] this formula assumes mathematically , strictly speaking , that @xmath146 in addition to @xmath147 .",
    "the first condition is however not very stringent ; it turns out numerically that ( 35 ) holds to better than 1 percent accuracy even when @xmath137 is as low as about 4 .",
    "we thus see that the dominant first term in eq .",
    "( 35 ) agrees qualitatively well with eq .",
    "( 33 ) , the latter obtained on basis of the `` square '' dispersion relation ( 21 ) .",
    "the latter expression is @xmath148 of the lorentz - based expression @xmath149 .",
    "this is a satisfactory result , in view of the semi - quantitative agreement between the meaning of the parameters @xmath137 occuring in ( 16 ) and in ( 34 ) .",
    "the second term in eq . ( 35 ) , @xmath150 , is the characteristic positive casimir energy ( corresponding to a repulsive force component ) for a _ nondispersive _ dilute ball satisfying the condition @xmath151 , at zero temperature .",
    ", for instance , @xcite .",
    "the other limiting case of interest is that of high temperatures .",
    "let us assume that @xmath152 [ 36 ] implying that @xmath153 for all values of @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( 31 ) . making use of @xmath154 and @xmath155 for small @xmath156 , we obtain as leading term @xmath157 [ 37 ]",
    "this expression is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the high - temperature casimir free energy , still negative , thus decreases proportionally with @xmath100 .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show how the nondimensional reduced casimir free energy @xmath158 , defined by @xmath159 [ 38 ] varies with @xmath100 , in the cases when @xmath160 .",
    "the low - temperature plateaus evidently lie at @xmath161 .",
    "these figures are given on a linear scale , thus exhibiting the linear behaviour predicted by eq .",
    "( 37 ) at high temperatures .",
    "it is of interest to check the accuracy of ( 37 ) in cases when the condition ( 36 ) is reasonably well , but not extremely well , satisfied .",
    "let us choose @xmath162 as an example .",
    "from the expression @xmath163 [ 39 ] we obtain , taking into account that @xmath164 , that @xmath165 the full series solution yields the number -20.047154 .",
    "the approximate formula ( 39 ) is thus in this case extremely accurate .",
    "choosing @xmath166 , we get from eq . ( 39 ) that @xmath167 , whereas the series ( 31 ) yields -2.091 . even in this case , where the condition ( 36 ) obviously is broken , the error in the formula ( 39 ) is thus only about 4 per cent . generally speaking , at high temperatures",
    "when the diluteness of the medium becomes more pronounced , the casimir free energy becomes small , as we would expect .    in connection with the temperature dependence of the free energy the following physical argument should be noticed . from the dispersion relations ( 21 ) or ( 34 )",
    "we would expect that the influence from the dispersion effect becomes important when the temperature becomes so high that the most significant frequencies in the thermal radiation field are of the same order as @xmath129 . and as most significant thermal frequency , it is natural to take the value @xmath168 corresponding to the _ maximum _ of the blackbody distribution . from wien s dispacement law we know that @xmath169 .",
    "thus , we expect that dispersion becomes significant when @xmath170 which , in view of the definition @xmath171 , means that @xmath172 .",
    "now , in figs . 1 - 3",
    "the linear scale chosen for the temperature implies that the intervals covered on the ordinate axes are small , and the mentioned effect becomes hidden ( the `` shoulder '' in each diagram appears to lie at a lower value of @xmath100 ) .",
    "the effect becomes however clear if we replace the linear temperature scale by a logarithmic scale .",
    "figure 4 shows , as an example , such a diagram for the case @xmath173 .",
    "then the ordinate interval becomes considerably larger , and we see that the prediction @xmath174 for the position of the \" shoulder turns out to be reasonable .",
    "( in the diagram we have drawn the line @xmath175 to emphasize the transitional region . )",
    "the same behaviour was previously found to hold in @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the high temperature entropy @xmath176 turns out to be constant : from eq .",
    "( 37 ) we get @xmath177 [ 40 ]",
    "instead of the formal divergence encountered in the previous section and the necessity to truncate the sum over @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( 28 ) at an upper limit @xmath126 , it is of interest to consider a mathematically more involved but physically more correct dispersion relation , that leads to a finite result for the free energy even after summing over all @xmath125 up to infinity .",
    "let us consider the following dispersion relation , being essentially of the lorentz form but augmented by a term in the denominator that describes spatial dispersion : @xmath178 [ 41 ] @xmath142 being a constant .",
    "as in the previous section we assume that the ball of radius @xmath0 is dilute ( @xmath179 ) , and that the exterior region is a vacuum .",

    "there is a definite low - temperature plateau , and for high values of @xmath100 the curves tend towards a linear form . in any case , whatever we adopt a square dispersion relation or a spatial - dispersion relation , the sensitivity with respect to increasing values of @xmath100 is most pronounced when @xmath137 is smallest .",
    "the limiting values for @xmath197 in fig .",
    "5 are in agreement with those of figs . 1 and 2 to within about 70 per cent .",

    "the regularization is made by subtracting off the volume terms in the two scalar green functions .",
