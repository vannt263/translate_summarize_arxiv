    "many important natural dynamical systems show the presence of long - range spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "for example , spatial scale - invariance is observed in fractal geographical and topographical structures - mountain ranges , river basins , etc . @xcite , while temporal scale - invariance in the form of @xmath0-like power spectra is observed in such diverse phenomena as star flickers and earthquakes @xcite .",
    "the spatial scale invariance in particular is in marked contrast to the typical behaviour of equilibrium thermodynamic systems , where such an invariance can be realized by tuning a parameter ( e.g. , the temperature ) to a critical value . to describe scale - invariance that occurs in dynamical systems without the explicit tuning of a parameter ,",
    "a model pioneered by  @xcite and later popularized as self - organized criticality ( soc ) by @xcite and @xcite , has begun to develop .    as a paradigm of self - organized critical behaviour",
    ", @xcite introduced the sandpile model , which they implement with a cellular automaton ( ca ) .",
    "a one - dimensional simple local version of the ca can be briefly described as follows @xcite .",
    "we start by prescribing two positive integers , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "then to each site @xmath3 , we assign an integer @xmath4 , representing the height of sand at location @xmath5 .",
    "the slope of the sandpile at @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the system is assumed to be closed at its left boundary ( @xmath7 ) , and open at the right one ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the dynamical process consists in dropping a single grain of sand onto a randomly chosen site . if the slope at any site @xmath5 exceeds @xmath1 , then @xmath2 grains of sand fall from @xmath5 onto the site @xmath9 .",
    "this process may cause the slope to exceed @xmath1 at adjacent sites .",
    "if necessary , @xmath2 grains fall to the right from any site at which the slope now exceeds @xmath1 .",
    "the process continues until all slopes are less than @xmath1 .",
    "this may be accomplished either with or without the loss of sand from the right boundary .",
    "the entire event caused by dropping a single grain is called an avalanche .",
    "the number of sites from which sand has fallen is called the size of the avalanche . after an avalanche",
    ", a grain is dropped again onto a randomly chosen site , hence another avalanche occurs , and the process continues indefinitely . the obtained numerical results @xcite indicate a power law distribution in the sizes of avalanches .",
    "this is exactly the type of distribution found at the critical point of traditional equilibrium systems .",
    "quantities related to the avalanche sizes also have power law behaviour .",
    "thereby one can define a set of critical exponents and scaling relations for the system @xcite .    as an alternative to the numerical study of soc in cellular automata",
    ", one can consider models based on differential equations that describe the fluctuations of a conserved quantity @xcite .",
    "more specifically , systems described by diffusion equations driven by noise terms shows characteristics similar to soc , with the numerical solutions of partial differential equations on finite grids yielding cellular automata with real - valued states .",
    "for example , the basic one dimensional diffusion equation @xmath10 can be transformed into the discrete equation @xmath11 $ ] @xcite .",
    "conversely , the diffusion limits of suitable cellular automaton models yield partial differential equations",
    ". the solutions of such diffusion equations exhibit scale - invariant behaviour , similar to that observed in sandpiles and related discrete models .",
    "it turns out that soc can already be understood on the level of the linear stochastic langevin equation @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that algebraic decay of spatial correlations is a reflection in spatial dimensions of the algebraic decay in time for systems with conservative dynamics .",
    "the possibility that soc results in some specific astrophysical phenomena has been intensively investigated recently , and the study of soc has become a major field of research in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "in particular , an interesting model to describe the properties of the accretion disks around black holes was introduced in @xcite , where it was suggested that the inner portions of black hole accretion disks may be in a self - organized critical state .",
    "consequently , @xmath0-like x - ray fluctuations are produced , in spite of random mass input .",
    "viscous diffusion processes are also incorporated in the model . hence in this approach mass accretion",
    "occurs either by an avalanche , which is triggered when the mass density of the disk exceeds some critical value , or by gradual gas diffusion .",
    "this initial model was further modified in @xcite , where a gradual diffusion which occurs regardless of the critical condition was introduced .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that with only one free model parameter , the cellular automaton model can reproduce some observational data of cyg x-1 .",
    "the relativistic effects were included in the model in @xcite , where it was shown that the ca model can produce light - curves and power - spectra for the variability that agree with the range observed in optical and x - ray studies of agn and x - ray binaries .",
    "it was also pointed out that when general relativistic effects are incorporated , important differences do appear if the disk is viewed from directions far from the accretion disk axis .",
    "the magnetic activity of an accretion disc using a probabilistic cellular automaton model was simulated in @xcite .",
    "the model is based on three free parameters , the probabilities of spontaneous and stimulated generation of magnetic flux above the surface of the disc , and the probability of diffusive disappearance of flux below the surface .",
    "this approach allows steady accretion in a disc by the action of coronal magnetic flux tubes alone , and if the effective viscosity caused by coronal loops is expressed in the usual shakura - sunyaev alpha parameter of viscosity , one can obtain numerical values which are in good agreement with observations .",
    "a modified soc model based on cellular automaton mechanism for producing lognormal flux distribution was presented in @xcite . in this model",
    "the energy released in the avalanche and diffusion in the accretion disk is not entirely emitted instantaneously , with some part of the energy kept in the disk .",
    "thus the disk increases its energy content , so that the next avalanche will be in higher energy condition , and more energy will be released .",
    "hence the later an avalanche occurs , the more amount of energy is emitted from the disk .",
    "on the other hand it was found observationally that a class of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) called soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgr ) do exhibit soc characteristics @xcite . from the statistics of the sgr 1806 - 20 bursts",
    "it was shown that the fluence distribution of bursts observed with different instruments is well described by power laws with indices 1.43 , 1.76 and 1.67 , respectively .",
    "thus , it turns out that the sgr 1806 - 20 bursts behave in a self - organized critical manner , similarly to earthquakes and solar flares @xcite . from an astrophysical point of view",
    "this behavior suggests that the energy sources for sgr bursts are crust - quakes , due to the evolving , strong magnetic field of the neutron star , rather than any accretion or nuclear reaction processes .",
    "a very similar result was obtained for the case of the x - ray flares of grbs with known redshifts by @xcite , who have shown that x - ray flares and solar flares share in common three statistical properties : power - law frequency distributions for energies , durations , and waiting times .",
    "all these distributions are specific for the physical framework of a soc system  @xcite .",
    "hence we have the interesting result that the statistical properties of x - ray flares of grbs are similar to solar flares , and therefore both can be attributed to a soc process . as suggested in @xcite ,",
    "both types of flares may be driven by a one dimensional soc magnetic reconnection process .",
    "on the other hand the x - ray flares of grbs cold be produced astrophysically in ultra - strongly magnetized millisecond pulsars , or long - term hyperaccreting disks around stellar - mass black holes .",
    "the possibility of the one dimensional soc modelling of x - ray grb afterglows , as well as the possibility of appearance of self - organized criticality in an one dimensional magnetized flow was carefully investigated in @xcite .",
    "a simplified one dimensional grid was used to model the evolution of the magnetized plasma flow .",
    "diffusion laws similar to those used to model magnetic reconnection with cellular automata in various astrophysical phenomena were implemented in the model , as well as a background flow . under the assumption that the parameter relevant for x - ray afterglows is the magnetic field , the magnetic energy released by one volume during one individual relaxation event was computed .",
    "the obtained results show that indeed in this system soc is established .",
    "the possible applications of this model to the study of the x - ray afterglows of grbs was also briefly considered .    however , _ from a strictly theoretical point of view one dimensional magnetic reconnection is not possible .",
    "_ this raises the interesting and important question of clarifying the relation between grb observations , showing that indeed one dimensional soc occurs in the astrophysical process , and their possible relation with one dimensional magnetic reconnection models . in order to answer to this question in the present paper",
    "we generalize the one dimensional model introduced in  @xcite .",
    "hence in order to describe the temporal evolution of grbs we develop a two - dimensional ca simulation algorithm , which implements the magnetic induction equation in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation framework .",
    "the bulk advection motion is , as a novelty with respect to other models , taken explicitly into account for various velocity profiles .",
    "the end purpose is to find a model which is simple to implement but which still captures the important macroscopic characteristic of observed x - ray afterglows in grbs .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that even the rigorously implemented physics is 2d , energetic initial impulses in the mhd flow lead to 1d signatures once the soc regime is established .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the simulation procedure is described in section  [ sect1 ] , and the discretized mhd equation for the magnetic induction are written down .",
    "the simulation results , and some of their astrophysical implications , are presented in section  [ sect2 ] .",
    "we discuss and conclude our findings in section  [ sect3 ] .",
    "although our goal is to keep the presentation in this section self - consistent , the reader is referred to  @xcite for technical details of the simulation that might be absent from our current presentation . in the following we concentrate on the evolution of the magnetic field in the cosmic environment . from a physical point of view , under certain conditions , the magnetic field topology can change suddenly , thus exhibiting a transition in its behaviour .",
    "the transition can be understood and quantified in terms of the laplacian of the magnetic field achieving a critical value  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation for the magnetic field is the magnetic induction equation .",
    "it describes the time and space evolution of a magnetic field in a non - ideal plasma medium .",
    "the magnetic induction equation is derived under the assumption that the mhd approximation holds in the plasma  @xcite , and that there is a background flow .",
    "we will present below a cellular automata approach to plasma dynamics .",
    "the information about the relevant physical parameter describing the dynamics of the system is stored in the cells of the grid  @xcite .",
    "we begin our presentation of the mathematical model to be simulated with the induction equation @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnetic field , @xmath14 is the plasma velocity , and @xmath15 is the total magnetic diffusivity coefficient , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electrical conductivity , and @xmath18 is the magnetic permeability in a vacuum .",
    "we define the control parameter in the plasma flow as @xmath19 to be computed for the four neighbours in a two dimensional grid ( left , right , up , down ) .",
    "the configuration we are working with is @xmath20 @xmath21 the magnetic field evolution equations then become @xmath22 @xmath23    in the numerical simulations , the time dynamics of the system is usually implemented as one of two different regimes ( advection or diffusion ) , as a function of the value of the control parameter .",
    "a connection to the physical process behind this switch between one regime or another can be made by the following reasoning . in astrophysical conditions",
    "the classical resistivity is very small , and the magnetic field behaves macroscopically as if the diffusion term in the magnetic induction equation would be zero .",
    "this behaviour is controlled by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are a characteristic velocity and a space - scale , respectively . from a physical point of view",
    "@xmath24 is a measure of the size of the advection term , @xmath28 , as compared with the size of the diffusion term , @xmath29 . when @xmath30 , the diffusion term in eq .",
    "( [ magnind ] ) is negligible , while for @xmath31 , the evolution of the magnetic field is purely diffusive .    however , under certain conditions , in relatively small volumes , the diffusive behaviour becomes dominant , and the magnetic field lines reconnect . to model this process in our grid",
    ", we assume that the astrophysical evolution occurs in two different regimes , with the switch between these two regimes determined by the behaviour of the control parameter .",
    "the control parameter tells us what is the value of the difference between the magnetic field between one grid point , and its neighbours . by definition ,",
    "this control parameter is thus local , and its characteristic scale @xmath32 is very small .",
    "if @xmath27 is the characteristic length scale of the simulation , then in our case @xmath33 is at least @xmath34 .",
    "if the control parameter exceeds a certain threshold , then what happens locally becomes worthwhile inspecting .",
    "since we may assume that the velocity does not change in order of magnitude , and since the diffusivity @xmath35 is constant ( the plasma properties do not change ) , the ratio between the macroscopic reynolds number and that of the local reynolds number is of the same order of @xmath33 .",
    "this can be viewed as a reason why the control parameter changes the behaviour of the reynolds number .",
    "to summarise , the advective regime is the main framework in which we develop our model .",
    "if the control parameter becomes critical the magnetic field evolution is given , for a brief period of time , by a diffusive behaviour .",
    "once this local criticality is relaxed , the control is given back to the advective evolution .",
    "analytically , @xmath36    we take the term @xmath37 as the stochastic source term and denote it by @xmath38 .",
    "the evolution equations are brought to dimensionless form by the scalings @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants . with these transformations ,",
    "the system description becomes    @xmath45    for the diffusive behaviour , and @xmath46 for the advective behaviour , where @xmath47 ; the dimensionless expression for the control parameter is @xmath48    in the solar corona the magnetic diffusivity @xmath15 can be approximated as @xmath49 @xmath50/s , while the diffusion region has a size of @xmath51 cm @xcite . by adopting a characteristic velocity of the order of @xmath52 cm / s ,",
    "it turns out that the magnetic reynolds number of a plasma with temperature @xmath53 k is around @xmath54 . in this case the diffusion term in the magnetic diffusion equation eq .",
    "( [ magnind ] ) is negligible .",
    "however , in solar physics there are several important exceptions , like , for example , in the neighbourhood of magnetic neutral points and lines , during magnetic reconnection , and during solar flares , when the diffusion processes play an important role in the understanding of the corresponding processes @xcite . in the case of the gamma ray bursts",
    ", one can estimate the magnetic reynolds number by adopting for the magnetic diffusion coefficient @xmath15 the perpendicular resistivity in a strong magnetic field @xmath55 @xmath50/s , where @xmath56 is the coulomb logarithm , with @xmath57 denoting boltzmann s constant and @xmath2 the particle number density , respectively @xcite . by assuming physical conditions specific for grbs",
    ", we find @xmath58 @xmath50/s , leading to a large magnetic reynolds number of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "however , by assuming for the magnetic diffusivity in grb magnetized plasma its maximum value @xmath60 , corresponding to the bohm diffusion , we obtain @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the co - moving frame cyclotron radius , and @xmath63 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "hence for the magnetic reynolds number in the bohm diffusion approximation @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 @xmath50/s , where @xmath66 is the luminosity of the grb ejecta in units of @xmath67 erg / s , @xmath68 is lorentz factor of the ejecta in units of @xmath69 , and @xmath17 is the magnetization parameter @xcite .",
    "hence for high values of the particle and ejected wind lorentz factors , and for relatively low gamma ray burst luminosities , in the bohm diffusion limit considerably small magnetic reynolds numbers may characterize the plasma ejected by the grb explosion .",
    "for example , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , during the post - explosion expansion of the relativistic fireball in a strong magnetic field both very high and low magnetic reynolds number regimes may be present , and this possibility must be taken into account when analysing the dynamical behaviour of the grb lightcurves .",

    "then we assume that one timestep can be converted to seconds by multiplying the duration of a reconnection event by the average number of events produced by the simulation , estimated to be around @xmath165 ( see figure  [ fig : d(n)chi100 ] ) . in the end , we conclude that @xmath166 timesteps make for one real second of observation time .    in order to estimate the energy in dimensions of @xmath167 produced by the simulation we use table  [ tab : input ] to get the order of magnitude for an @xmath168 produced by one timestep , @xmath169 ; if we assume that the conversion factor from time step to second is @xmath166 , than the conversion factor between the dimensionless energy and the physical real energy is approximately @xmath170 .",
    "the observed energy output in grb explosions is around @xmath171  @xcite ; the interval of dimensionless value for the energy obtained by simulations covers the values needed to produce agreement with observations .",
    "compared with observational grb data & obs . & theory + event lifetime distribution ( analytical dependency @xmath172 ) & yes & @xmath173 & @xmath173 + psd ( analytical dependency @xmath174 ) & yes & @xmath173 & @xmath173 + light curve & yes , a qualitative visual comparison & @xmath173 & - + maximum released energy & yes , if the proposed conversion factor from dimensionless to dimensional is accepted & @xmath173 & - + number of peaks in the light curve & yes , for some types of data & @xmath173 & - + waiting time in the lc & yes , if the waiting time is defined as time between subsequent avalanches in the grid ( soc characteristic ) no , if waiting time is defined as lapsed time between initial pulse and maximum of the lc , because depends on the initial condition in the grid which is unknown no , if waiting time is defined as time lapsed between independent prominent light curve features , i.e. as those caused by different pulses at the base & - & @xmath173 + critical parameter timestep evolution & no , this is just for soc validation . for the moment this is just a theoretical tool . & - & @xmath173 + critical parameter maximum value & no , although this could be done in principle if magnetograms of the studied regions would be available & - & - + magnetic field divergence & no , this is just for general model validation ( fundamental physics constraint ) & - & @xmath173 +    [ tab : output ]    we note one very interesting fact : _ for zero velocity ( i.e. , no pulse at the base of the simulation grid ) , the model produces an event lifetime distribution slope in agreement with theory .",
    "_ for low impulse velocity , the event lifetime distribution slope is still close to the theoretic one .",
    "however , when @xmath96 increases , for certain velocity profiles , the slope of @xmath113 vs. @xmath112 departs from its theoretical value .",
    "the issue is best illustrated by plotting the value of the spectral slope as a function of @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slopevschi ] ) .",
    "it is clear that for high values of @xmath96 , one obtains a spectral slope with a value very close to @xmath84 , the theoretical accepted spectral slope for 1d soc .",
    "_ from a strict theoretical point of view , one dimensional magnetic reconnection is not possible ; it was thus a problem ( swept under the rug ) to say that while the observational data for grbs shows that a one dimensional soc is occurring , this is due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "_    _ however , our results can be interpreted as showing that the physics is genuinely 2d , but an energetic initial impulse leads to a 1d soc signature .",
    "_     is made for the lifetime distribution .",
    "the plot shows the values of @xmath141 as a function of @xmath96 , for @xmath175 . ]",
    "is made for the event size distribution .",
    "the plot shows the values of @xmath143 as a function of @xmath96 , for @xmath175 . ]",
    "the physics and observations of grbs are extremely complex .",
    "it is understandable that a simple ca model can not and does not reproduce all features of the real process . as such , we list some of the caveats of our model : it does not produce information about bulk lorentz factor , about isotropy ( or lack thereof ) of the radiation . also , although under some assumptions , magnetic ca models can produce maps of the magnetic field on the microscopic level , this was not the purpose of this paper .",
    "a discussion of how well the model agrees with observational data is presented in table  [ tab : output ] .",
    "in the present paper we have presented a two dimensional ca model for a magnetized grid with an initial large flow and a stochastic perturbation .",
    "the discretized laws for the evolution of the magnetic field were deduced and implemented .",
    "this study extends to two dimensions the one dimensional soc approach introduced in @xcite for the analysis of one dimensional magnetized plasma flows . as a main result of our investigation",
    "we have found that the two dimensional magnetized plasma with a background flow system exhibits soc .",
    "the event lifetime and event size distributions and the emitted electromagnetic energy were obtained , and their astrophysical interpretation was briefly discussed .",
    "it was shown that this approach can be used to model grbs and some of their properties , as summarized in table  [ tab : output ] .",
    "most importantly , the model produces results which agree with the observations on the same time and energy scales , which to our knowledge is a novelty .",
    "@xcite suggested to use ca and soc methods to study and interpret the x - ray flares of grbs .",
    "here we further postulated that the main burst , i.e. , the grb itself , also arise from soc processes .",
    "in contrast to the standard grb models , where each pulse correspond to one energy injection ( e.g. , internal shock model ) , here we show that in the soc model one energy input is able to generate a series of pulses , which are characteristic of many grbs .",
    "moreover , we have found that some general features of grbs ( and especially the light curves ) can be described in the framework of the present soc model .",
    "it would be interesting to compare our mathematical soc formalism with the one used to study the properties of the accretion by black holes . in the model introduced in @xcite ,",
    "the accretion disk is divided into two parts , the outer disk region , and the inner disk region , respectively . in the outer disk region ,",
    "the gas drifts smoothly inward , while in the inner disk region blobs are formed .",
    "the whole disk is divided into 64 rings , and angularly divided into 64 equal parts .",
    "the physical quantity stored in the cells is the mass in that region . since the mass is continuously flowing to the outermost region of the disk , a randomly chosen cell in the ring receives a fixed amount of mass @xmath176 .",
    "if the mass of the cell is larger than the critical value @xmath177 , a mass flow will occur to the three nearest cells in the adjacent inner ring . by denoting the mass in the cell with",
    "coordinates @xmath5 ( representing the radial position ) and @xmath178 ( representing the angular position ) by @xmath179 , when @xmath180 , the following ca process happens : @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity is of the order of the gravitational potential energy lost in the process , and it can be obtained as @xmath184 .",
    "in contrast to the above approach , in the present paper we start from the basic result that diffusion type partial differential equations driven by noise can produce characteristic effects similar to soc @xcite . hence , we consider a discretized version of the magnetic induction equation , in the presence of a stochastic term generated by the matter flow and the gradient of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic induction equation is considered in two limiting cases , corresponding to the diffusive and advective regimes , respectively .",
    "there are also significant differences in the physical approach of the two models . while in the accretion disk model of @xcite",
    "the parameter stored in the grid is the mass , in the present approach the stored quantity is the value of the magnetic field .",
    "the disk luminosity is assumed to be purely of gravitational origin in the accretion disk ca models , while in the present case the radiation emission is purely electromagnetic .",
    "an important characteristic of systems that reached soc is that a slight change in the external conditions of the system determines the generation of avalanches of various sizes .",
    "these avalanches keep , on average , the system near the critical state @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that a minor effect can result in an avalanche of a much bigger size ( catastrophe ) .",
    "this kind of catastrophic behaviour could be also responsible for the grbs explosions , and overall evolution .",
    "therefore soc and ca methods can be used , and may prove useful , in modelling early phases - explosive or immediately post - explosive - of the grbs .",
    "once a given critical condition is reached , it is self - maintained , i.e. , there is no need to vary or fine tune its physical and control parameters .",
    "this situation is quite different as compared , for example , with the critical state in liquid , where two thermodynamic parameters(the temperature and the density ) must be tuned to keep the fluid system near its critical point .",
    "it is a general property of soc that the event lifetime and size distributions of avalanches are described in terms of power laws with negative exponents .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why models based on soc can be successfully used to describe various natural phenomena . in the present paper",
    "we have developed some necessary ( but not sufficient ) tools that are required for the in depth comparison of the theoretical models with the specific observations of the cosmological gamma ray bursts .",
