    "the characterization of memory effects in non - markovian evolutions is a fundamental subject in the theory of open systems  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the markovian behavior is always an idealization in the description of the quantum dynamics , with non - markovianity being non - negligible in a number of different scenarios , such as biological  @xcite or condensed matter systems  @xcite . from an applied point of view , non - markovian dynamics may be a resource for quantum tasks through an increase in the capacities of quantum channels  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also exhibits applications in fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "rigorously , non - markovianity can be defined through the deviation of a dynamical evolution map from a _ divisible _ completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is manifested both in entanglement  @xcite and in other correlation sources  @xcite , providing an approach that takes advantage of quantum information tools in the open - systems realm .",
    "more specifically , non - markovianity can be interpreted in this context as a flow of information back to the system due to its interaction with the environment , which may imply non - monotonic behavior of correlations as a function of time .    here , we propose a general framework to characterize non - markovianity through multipartite measures of quantum , classical , and total correlations . recently , there has been growing interest in the investigation of correlation measures from a quantum information perspective  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "measures for quantum correlations such as those provided by discordlike quantities and their corresponding classical counterparts have been formulated , with these quantities used as resources for implementing a variety of quantum tasks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these measures were originally introduced in an entropic scenario by ollivier and zurek  @xcite . in a geometric context , correlations can be defined based on the relative entropy  @xcite , hilbert - schmidt norm  @xcite , trace norm  @xcite , and bures norm  @xcite .",
    "all of these distinct versions of correlation measures can be described by a unified framework in terms of a generalized distance ( or pseudo distance ) function  @xcite .",
    "our approach for non - markovianity includes all these measures as particular cases and characterizes the non - markovian behavior by taking into account the program introduced by rivas , huelga , and plenio  @xcite , in which an ancilla is coupled to a system which interacts with an environment .",
    "specifically , we provide a rigorous description of the hypotheses over local dynamical maps under which quantum , classical , and total correlations can be used as measures of non - markovianity .",
    "we illustrate the results considering the dynamics of the trace - distance correlations in qubit systems under either local dephasing or generalized amplitude damping ( gad ) .",
    "let us suppose a quantum process governed by a time - local master equation @xmath0 where the time - dependent generator @xmath1 is given by @xmath2   + \\sum_i \\gamma_i ( t ) \\left ( a_i(t)\\rho(t)a^\\dagger_i(t ) \\right .",

    "the master equation describes the dynamics of the density operator through @xmath8 , with the cptp map @xmath9 given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 denoting the chronological time - ordering operator .",
    "the dynamical map @xmath9 then satisfies the divisibility condition @xmath12 @xmath13 ) , which characterizes the markovianity of the quantum process . on the other hand , for @xmath14 , the corresponding dynamical map @xmath9 may not be cptp for intermediate time intervals and the divisibility property of the overall cptp dynamics is violated , which characterizes a non - markovian behavior  @xcite .",
    "if a function @xmath15 is monotonically nonincreasing under divisible maps acting on @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 when @xmath12 , then @xmath18 is monotonically nonincreasing with increasing time , namely , @xmath19 . however , this is not always true for a non - markovian process , in which the divisibility of the map is violated , with @xmath20 being a straightforward non - markovianity witness  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 can be employed to point out the breakdown of markovianity and the degree of non - markovianity can be defined by @xmath21 with the maximization performed over all sets of possible initial states @xmath22 and the integration extended over all time intervals for which @xmath23 .",
