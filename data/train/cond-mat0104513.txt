    "we note that the assumption of rectangular pulses is not required by the numerical technique we use and is made here only for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we could also consider other shapes of the pulses which are more realistic for specific physical systems , and especially , we could consider imperfect switching processes as well ; the latter would constitute a further source of decoherence .",

    "since we want to investigate the role of bit - flip errors as well as phase errors we include in our model two different types of interactions : on the one hand , the @xmath42-components of the spins couple to the fluctuating environment and the populations of the qubit states are disturbed ( bit - flip errors ) . on the other hand , phase errors are generated by a coupling of the @xmath43-components of the spins to the environmental noise .",

    "the panel a. ) illustrates the results for the bit flip errors with @xmath154 , and correspondingly panel b. ) for the phase errors with @xmath155 .",
    "as one can observe , the superconducting qubits ( set i ) can perform with a smaller interqubit coupling than the quantum dot qubits ( set iii ) .",
    "moreover , the use of an interqubit coupling larger than @xmath156 is advantageous .",
    "the horizontal dotted - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig.couplx ] b. ) indicates the lower bound of @xmath150 for nonlocality .",
    "in this work we have shown that the numerical quasiadiabatic propagator path integral method ( quapi ) of makri and makarov provides an appropriate method to investigate decohering quantum information processes which involve time - dependent hamiltonians in presence of a coupling to an external environment .",
    "we have applied this iterative algorithm to the example of the quantum xor gate operation and have obtained the full time - resolved evolution of the two - qubit system in presence of time - dependent external fields .",
    "no further approximations on the time evolution of the gate operation such as a markovian evolution or extended time spans of the gate operation have been invoked .",
    "we have investigated the quality of the quantum xor operation by numerically determining four characteristic gate quantifiers , i.e. , the fidelity @xmath94 , the purity @xmath95 , the quantum degree @xmath96 , and the entanglement capability @xmath97 of the gate .",
    "we have simulated the gate operation for three parameter sets which mimic realistic experimental situations for condensed matter qubits , such as flux and charge qubits in superconducting josephson systems and qubits in semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "thereby , we have suceeded to investigate systematically the quality of the gate operation as a function of the environmental temperature @xmath52 , the friction strength @xmath157 , and the strength @xmath152 of the interqubit coupling .",
    "two different types of errors in the qubits have been modelled : ( i ) bit - flip errors and ( ii ) phase errors .",
    "we have elucidated how the different physical setups perform under these conditions . as major findings",
    "we establish that the quality of the gate depends _ only weakly on temperature _ but rather _ strongly on the friction strength_. moreover , we have illustrated that the interqubit coupling strength plays an important role and should not be smaller than @xmath158 with @xmath159 being the typical energy scale of the qubit system .",
    "in order for a quantum information processor to operate optimally the decoherent influence of the environment needs to be suppressed .",
    "therefore , three different approaches are currently discussed : these are the techniques of quantum error correction , fault tolerant quantum computation , and entanglement purification @xcite . the general idea common to all three methods",
    "is to use for quantum information processing only a small subset of a larger set of entangled ancilla qubits .",
    "although these ideas are very promising for small register lengths , the techniques become increasingly difficult if one attempts to realize large qubit registers in physical systems .",
    "moreover , one has to keep track of the quantum state of the environment . whilst these requirements are seemingly feasible for quantum optical information processing systems @xcite , they appear insufficient for condensed matter systems with their characteristic huge number of environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "an alternative approach consists in minimizing the occurrence of errors by _ controlling decoherence _ via the application of tailored time - dependent external fields to qubit systems @xcite .",
    "for example , the application of a time - dependent periodic external field can induce a floquet spectrum with degenerate quasienergy states @xcite or it can move the qubit out off resonance with certain bath modes @xcite thereby reducing decoherence . the suitability of such schemes to a quantum gate operation , however , remains to be demonstrated .",
