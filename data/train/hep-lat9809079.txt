    "for the purpose of understanding meson - meson interactions from the qcd , we studied the ground and the 1st excited state energy of 4-quark system measured by the su(2 ) lattice monte - carlo .",
    "the configuration of the four quarks that we consider are large square(ls ) , rectangular(r ) , tilted rectangular(tr ) , linear(l ) , quadrilateral(q ) , non - planar(np ) and tetrahedral(th ) .",

    "we observed that among the three bases , one base can be treated as a linear combination of the other two , but within a base in the coarse lattice , when the shortest path between a quark and an antiquark is not along any link , there are several possible configurations of links , which are specified by the parity .",

    "we assume that the length of the zig - zag perimeter has the fractal dimension 2 , and so it is fixed from that of the coarse lattice , use the string constant @xmath3 measured in the simulation of the 2-quark potentials and fit constants @xmath17 and @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the length @xmath19 depends on the base but the minimal area @xmath1 are chosen to be independent of the base and estimated by the analytical form derived in the regular surface approximation .",
