    "the luminosity function  and the cosmic grb rate are observationally entangled as the observed rate is a convolution of the luminosity function  with the cosmic rate .",

    "the rate was assumed to be constant .",
    "the simplest form for the luminosity function  was a standard candle i.e. a constant luminosity .",
    "these early studies used the measured   value to find the typical luminosity @xcite and correspondingly a maximal distance from which grbs were observed . later , using the flux distribution ( @xmath12 relation ) , @xcite and @xcite showed how relaxing the standard candle assumption allows a corresponding relaxation of the constant rate assumption .",

    "@xcite used a sample of long bursts with redshift and found evidence for luminosity evolution .",
    "other papers , including this one , find self consistency without a luminosity evolution .",
    "we introduce here a new method for determining the rate and the luminosity , by inverting the observations without making any assumptions on the functional form of the luminosity and rate functions .",
    "this direct inversion allows us to use most of the available redshift data and to obtain robust estimation of both functions .    in  [ sec :",
    "sample ] we describe the sub - sample of bursts we analyze and its advantages over other samples . in  [ sec : direct ] we introduce a new formalism allowing us to directly invert the observed distribution and obtain the intrinsic luminosity function  and rate . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results obtained using this method and the confidence ranges associated with them . in  [ sec : contosfr ] we address the question whether the grb rate is consistent with the sfr .",
    "we discuss a few implications of the results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider long bursts ( @xmath14 ) detected by _ swift _ from the beginning of its operation until burst 090726 , information page @xmath15 with a measured peak - flux and a measured redshift .",
    "generally grbs redshifts are obtained from the optical afterglow spectrum using absorption lines or photometry , or from the spectrum of the host galaxy using emission lines .",
    "however in the global sample we find different redshift distributions for the different detection methods , namely : absorption , emission and photometry ( see figure [ fig : zmethodsdist ] ) . for redshifts determined using the hosts emission lines , we do not detect high - redshift events , whereas absorption lines redshifts extend over the entire range of redshifts .",
    "furthermore , emission lines are more susceptible to a selection effect known as the redshift desert in the range @xmath16 , ] ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is in line with the fact that we have also found that the probability to measure the redshift using emission lines strongly depends on the gamma ray flux , favoring high fluxes .",
    "this effect is mild for absorption lines and photometry ( see appendix b ) .    to obtain a more uniform sample we consider therefore only bursts whose",
    "redshift was measured using the afterglow . for each burst",
    "we calculate the isotropic equivalent peak - luminosity : @xmath17 ( see appendix a. for details ) using the peak - flux and redshift .",
    "we use standard @xmath18 cosmology with @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the luminosity function  is redshift independent . in this case",
    "the number of bursts at a given redshift and with a given luminosity is the product of the luminosity function , @xmath20 , that depends only on the luminosity @xmath21 and the grb rate , @xmath22 , that depends only on the redshift @xmath23 .",
    "this common assumption is reasonable since a - priori there is no competing reason why the luminosity function should depend on the redshift .",
    "we test later the validity of this assumption and show that it is accepted with a high statistical significance .",
    "the isotropic peak luminosity function , @xmath20 , is defined traditionally as the fraction of grbs with isotropic equivalent luminosities in the interval @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the rate , @xmath22 , is defined as the co - moving space density of grbs in the interval @xmath23 to @xmath26 .",
    "the distribution density : @xmath27 is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the differential co - moving rate of bursts at a redshift z , @xmath30 is the derivative of the volume element and the factor @xmath31 reflects the cosmological time dilation .",
    "we consider now a direct method to invert the observed @xmath32 distribution and obtain the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "to do so we approximate @xmath20 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 whose range is divided to bins with a constant value within each bin .",
    "these functions can be expressed as a sum of heaviside functions .",
    "first , we divide both luminosity and redshift intervals into bins .",
    "we denote @xmath37 @xmath38 we also define the _ weights factors _ @xmath39 as the _ probability for detecting a burst with a measured redshift",
    "z and luminosity l _ where @xmath40 is the probability to detect and measure redshift for a burst with a luminosity @xmath21 at a redshift @xmath23 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we denote the observed number of events per bin as : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44    next , we determine @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the error estimates , using the maximum - likelihood formalism .",
    "we define @xmath47 the ( logarithmic ) likelihood of the model given the observations as : @xmath48",
    "- n \\ln [ \\sum_{ij } \\phi_i r_j w_{ij } ] \\ .\\ ] ] at the maximum all partial derivatives of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath45 and with respect to @xmath46 vanish , leading to @xmath49 and @xmath50 notice that the second term on the right hand side of each of the equations [ eqn : rate1 ] and [ eqn : lumf ] is the same normalization factor .",
    "we have a set of non - linear equations with as many equations as variables .",
    "we solve numerically these non linear equations using successive iterations until convergence .",
    "a - priori it is not clear whether @xmath33 and @xmath51 are uniquely determined and whether there is a solution at all .",
    "however , we find good convergence . we have examined a large set ( @xmath52 ) of initial guesses where each component was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "we found a rapid convergence to a unique solution for all initial guesses , all reaching the requested accuracy of @xmath53 with less than 25 iterations .",
    "we thus conclude that the existence of other stable solutions is very unlikely .",
    "we approximate the error as the value for which m deviate by -1 from it s maximum : ( i.e. the likelihood is smaller by a factor @xmath54 ) .",
    "this reflects an @xmath55 error for a normal - distribution . @xmath56",
    "@xmath57 the two solutions , i.e. the positive one and the negative one , give an upper and a lower bounds on the error respectively . for small deviations we can approximate the error using the second derivatives of m : @xmath58 @xmath59    to estimate the uncertainty induced by the specific bins choice , we preform all the analysis for a 1/2 unit redshift and @xmath60 binning and repeat for a 1/3 unit binning ( where all bins widths are 1/3 unit , except the last two redshift bins which we can not change because they contain too few data points ) . in the following ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use the 1/2 unit binning for all further analysis .",
    "clearly , the results with different binning are slightly different , but they are all within each other s error range . when we include the uncertainty induced by the binning the error ranges",
    "become only slightly wider .",
    "so far , we have not assumed any functional form for the luminosity function or for the rate as our method does not require such an assumption .",
    "raw `` results are depicted in figures [ fig : rate ] and [ fig : luminosity ] . later on",
    "we will compare these step functions with models for the grb rate that follow the sfr .",
    "however , in order to easily characterized the result we need to approximate our  raw '' step functions with simple functional forms . therefore ,",
    "after obtaining the results in the form of step functions we approximate them in term of broken power laws : @xmath61 @xmath62 we obtain the parameters of the best fit functions by minimizing the @xmath63 values .",
    "upper frame : the resulting step function and the best fit model : a broken power law with indices @xmath64 , @xmath65 and with a break at @xmath66 ( solid line ) .",
    "the @xmath63 values for the models is 2.3 at 10 d.o.f . giving a rejection probability of 0.007 .",

    "estimates we preformed a monte - carlo simulation . in this simulation",
    "we use the model with the best fit parameters to draw random sets of data ( with same size as the real sample ) .",
