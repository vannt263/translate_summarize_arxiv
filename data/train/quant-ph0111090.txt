    "quantum game theory started from a seminal paper by meyer @xcite .",
    "later eisert et .",
    "@xcite studied the important bimatrix game of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) while focussing on the concept of nash equilibrium ( ne ) from noncooperative game theory .",
    "this concept attracted much attention in other recent works in quantum game theory @xcite .",
    "in fact cournot ( 1838 ) @xcite anticipated nash s definition of equilibrium by over a century but only in the context of a particular model of duopoly . in economics ,",
    "an oligopoly is a form of market in which a number @xmath0 of producers , say , @xmath1 , and no others , provide the market with a certain commodity . in the special case where @xmath2 , it is called a duopoly .",
    "cournot s work @xcite is one of the classics of game theory and also a cornerstone of the theory of industrial organization @xcite . in cournot model of duopoly two - firms",
    "simultaneously put certain quantities of a homogeneous product in the market .",
    "cournot obtained an equilibrium value for the quantities both firms will decide to put in the market .",
    "this equilibrium value was based on a rule of behavior which says that if all the players except one abide by it , the remaining player can not do better than to abide by it too .",
    "nash gave a general concept of an equilibrium point in a noncooperative game but existence of an equilibrium in duopoly game was known much earlier .",
    "the `` cournot equilibrium '' refers to ne in noncooperative form of duopoly that cournot considered .    in an interesting later development stackelberg ( 1934 )",
    "@xcite proposed a dynamic model of duopoly in which , contrary to cournot s assumption of simultaneous moves , a leader ( or dominant ) firm moves first and a follower ( or subordinate ) firm moves second .",
    "a well known example is the general motors playing this leadership role in the early history of u.s .",
    "automobile industry when more than one firms like ford and chrysler acted as followers . in this sequential game",
    "a `` stackelberg equilibrium '' is obtained using the _ backwards - induction outcome _ of the game .",
    "in fact stackelberg equilibrium refers to the sequential - move nature of the game and this is a stronger solution concept than ne because sequential move games sometimes have multiple ne , only one of which is associated with the backwards - induction outcome of the game @xcite .    the seminal paper by meyer @xcite has initiated the new field of quantum games and has motivated many people to look at games from quantum perspectives .",
    "eisert et .",
    "@xcite quantized the famous bimatrix game of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) and showed that dilemma disappears in quantum world .",
    "they allowed players an access to a maximally entangled state that can be generated from a system of two qubits .",
    "each player then unitarily manipulates a qubit in his possession .",
    "players apply a unitary operator from a particular subset of the general set of unitary operators that also forms a group .",
    "benjamin @xcite later showed that if the players have access to the set of general unitary operators then there is no ne in pure strategies in the pd game .",
    "benjamin implied that eisert s set of unitary operators was carefully chosen to generate a ne that has no classical counterpart .",
    "eisert et .",
    "@xcite used an unentangling gate in their scheme to be put before the quantum state is forwarded to measuring apparatus that collapses the wave function and gives the payoffs .",
    "the unentangling gate in eisert s scheme ensured that classical game could be reproducible but it motivated marinatto @xcite to question the necessity of its presence in the scheme to play a quantum game .",
    "marinatto and weber @xcite came up with a solution where an initial quantum state , they called it an `` initial strategy '' , is made available to the players .",
    "this initial strategy is then unitarily manipulated by the players in the `` tactics '' phase of the game that consisted of applying two unitary and hermitian operators ( the identity and an inversion operator ) with classical probabilities on the initial quantum strategy .",
    "this inversion operator reverts the quantum state just like the pauli s spin flip operator does @xcite .",
    "marinatto and weber @xcite showed that for an initial strategy that is a maximally entangled state a unique ne for the game of battle of sexes can be obtained .",
    "later in an interesting comment benjamin @xcite considered the players access to apply only two unitary and hermitian operators with classical probabilities on a quantum state a severe restriction on all quantum mechanically possible manipulations .",
    "marinatto and weber replied @xcite that the only restriction on a quantum form of a game is that corresponding classical game must be reproducible as a special case of the quantum form .    agreeing with this reply we studied the concept of evolutionary stability in asymmetric as well as symmetric quantum games @xcite .",
    "our prime motivation was an important and interesting element in marinatto and weber s scheme .",
    "it was the fact that a switch - over between a classical and a non - classical form of a game could be achieved by having a control over the parameters of the initial quantum state or initial strategy . in the scheme of eisert , wilkens , and lewenstein @xcite",
    "such a switch - over takes place when the players assign specific values to the parameters of the unitary operators in their possession ; while the initial two - qubit quantum state always remains to be maximally entangled .",
    "starting a quantum game from a general pure state of two qubits that have interacted previously we were able to show the possibility that an unstable symmetric ne of a bimatrix classical game becomes stable in a quantum form of the same game @xcite .",
    "our assumption in this approach was that a replacement of the maximally entangled two qubit quantum state , that marinatto and weber used to get a unique ne , with a general two qubit pure quantum state also results in another form of the same game .",
    "this assumption led us to find the conditions on the constants of a general three qubit pure state that made it possible to counter against coalition formation in a three player symmetric game @xcite .",
    "the person responsible for preparing quantum states can thus make vanish the motivation to make a coalition in the cooperative game .",
    "motivated by these recent developments in quantum games as well as the notion of backwards - induction outcome of a dynamic game of complete information @xcite we present a quantum perspective on the interesting game of stackelberg duopoly . in present paper",
    "we start with the same assumption that a game is decided only by players unitary manipulations , payoff operators , and the measuring apparatus deciding payoffs .",
    "when these are same a different input quantum initial state gives only a different form of the same game .",
    "this was our assumption when we studied evolutionary stability of a mixed ne in rock - scissors - paper game @xcite .",
    "therefore all the games that can be obtained by using a general two qubit pure state are only different forms of the same game if the rest of the procedures in playing the quantum game are same .",
    "for example in marinatto and weber s battle of sexes @xcite the game remains battle of sexes for all two qubit pure quantum states .    with this assumption",
    "we start an analysis of stackelberg duopoly by asking a fundamental question : is it possible to find a two qubit pure quantum state that generates the classical cournot equilibrium as a backwards - induction outcome of the quantum form of stackelberg duopoly ?",
    "why this question can be of interest ?",
    "for us it is interesting because in case the answer is yes then the very important resource in quantum game theory i.e. entanglement can potentially be a particularly useful element for ` follower ' in the leader - follower model of stackelberg duopoly @xcite .",
    "this is because in classical settings when static duopoly changes itself into a dynamic form the follower becomes worse - off compared to leader who becomes better - off .",
    "we find that under certain restrictions it is possible to find the needed two qubit quantum states .",
    "therefore a quantum form of a dynamic game of complete information gives out an equilibrium that corresponds to classical static form of the same game . in our analysis",
    "the equilibrium can be obtained for a certain range of the constant of the duopoly game .",
    "this restriction appears only due to an assumption that we introduce to simplify calculations .",
    "this fact , however , does not rule out the possibility of getting a quantum form of stackelberg duopoly game with no such restriction .",
    "to make this paper self - contained we give an introduction of the backwards - induction outcome of a sequential game .",
    "for this we find very useful the ref .",
    "consider a simple three step game    1 .",
    "player 1 chooses an action @xmath3 from the feasible set @xmath4 2 .",
    "player 2 observes @xmath3 and then chooses an action @xmath5 from the feasible set @xmath6 3 .",
    "payoffs are @xmath7 and @xmath8    this game is an example of the dynamic games of complete and perfect information",
    ". key features of such games are    1 .",
    "the moves occur in sequence 2 .",
    "all previous moves are known before next move is chosen , and 3 .",
    "the players payoffs are common knowledge . at the second stage of the game",
    "when player @xmath9 gets the move he or she faces the following problem , given the action @xmath3previously chosen by the player    @xmath10    assume that for each @xmath3 in @xmath4 , player @xmath9 s optimization problem has a unique solution @xmath11 also called the best response of player @xmath9 .",
    "now player @xmath12 can also solve player @xmath9 s optimization problem by anticipating player @xmath9 s response to each action @xmath3 that player @xmath12 might take .",
    "so that player @xmath12 faces the following problem @xmath13 suppose this optimization problem also has a unique solution for player @xmath12 and is denoted by @xmath14 . the solution @xmath15 is the backwards - induction outcome of this game . in a simple version of the cournot s model two firms",
    "simultaneously decide the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively of a homogeneous product they want to put into the market",

    "in a two - player game theoretical model of this situation a firm s payoff or profit can be written as @xcite @xmath25   = q_{i}\\left [   a - c-(q_{i}% + q_{j})\\right ]   = q_{i}\\left [   k-(q_{i}+q_{j})\\right ]   \\label{payoffeq}%\\ ] ] solving for the ne easily gives the cournot equilibrium @xmath26 at this equilibrium the payoffs to both firms from eq .",

    "we find backwards - induction outcome in classical and a quantum form of stackelberg s duopoly .",
    "taking advantage from bigger picture given to this dynamic game by hilbert space structure we then find two qubit pure quantum states that give classical cournot s equilibrium as the backwards - induction outcome of the quantum game of stackelberg s duopoly .",

    "the condition ( [ condn3 ] ) says that bob s reaction to alice s choice of @xmath93 is @xmath94 . to show that such quantum states can exist for which the conditions ( [ condn1],[condn2],[condn3 ] ) with the normalization ( [ normn ] ) hold true we give an example where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are written as functions of @xmath97 with our assumption that @xmath98 .",
    "though this assumption puts its own restriction on the possible range of @xmath97 for which the above conditions hold for these functions but still it shows clearly the possibility of finding the required initial quantum states .",

    "what can possibly be a relevance of considering a quantum form of a game that models a competition between two firms in macroscopic world of economics ?",
    "quantum mechanics was developed to understand phenomena in the regime of atomic and subatomic interactions and is still mostly used in that domain .",
    "what is of interest in extending a game theoretical model of interaction between firms towards quantum domain ?",
    "these questions naturally arise not only with reference to stackelberg duopoly considered in this paper but also other related works in quantum games . apart from exciting new directions that quantum mechanics brings to game theory",
    "there is also a fundamental interest in quantum games from the view of quantum information theory .",
    "the fact that quantum algorithms may be thought of as games between classical and quantum agents was pointed out by meyer @xcite .",
    "meyer indicated a strong motivation for the study of quantum games by considering zero - sum quantum games in order to have a new starting point at hand to find quantum algorithms that outperform its classical analogue .",
    "many quantum information exchange protocols have been modelled like games .",
    "eavesdropping and optimal cloning are two such often cited examples where objective before a player is to gain as much information as possible .",
    "we believe that like other notions of game theory finding some relevance in quantum information a consideration of backwards - induction can be of interest for exactly the same reasons .",
    "it does not seem hard to imagine situations in quantum information where moves occur in sequence , all previous moves are observed before the next move is chosen , players payoffs from each feasible combination of moves are common knowledge .",
    "interesting questions then arise about how a quantum version of dynamic game of complete information can influence the outcome .",
    "our primary motivation , however , to study backwards - induction in quantum games is from the view of dynamic stability , especially of symmetric ne , that has important relevance in evolutionary games @xcite that we found interesting in quantum settings @xcite .",
    "the duopoly game models economic competition between firms and applied economics is the area where it is studied in detail .",
    "we considered this game in a scheme that tells how to play a quantum game and gives a hilbert structure to the strategy space to which players have access to .",
    "the fact that quantum game theory can give entirely new views on games important in economics is apparent in recent interesting papers by piotrowski and sladkowski @xcite proposing a quantum - like description of markets and economies where players strategies belong to hilbert space .",
    "it shows that quantum games certainly have features of interest to applied economists . reciprocating with it we showed that games played by firms in economic competition can give counter - intuitive solutions when played in a quantum world .",
    "we conclude our results as follows .",
    "a comparison between the ne in cournot game with backwards - induction outcome in classical stackelberg duopoly shows that having alice ( or firm @xmath28 who acts first ) know that bob ( or firm @xmath30 who acts second ) knows @xmath16 ( alice s move ) hurts bob .",
    "in fact in classical stackelberg game bob should not believe that alice has chosen its stackelberg quantity i.e. @xmath106 .",
    "we have shown that there can be a quantum version of stackelberg duopoly where bob is not hurt even if he knows the quantity @xmath16 chosen by alice .",
    "the backwards - induction outcome of this quantum game is the same as the ne in classical cournot game where decisions are made simultaneously and there is no such information that hurts a player .",
    "though this outcome in quantum game is obtained for a restricted range of the variable @xmath97 but it is only because of a simplification in calculations .",
