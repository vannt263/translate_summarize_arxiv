    "there has been recent interest in the so - called ` ultraviolet slowing down ' of fermionic simulations in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "these studies try to address algortmically large fluctuations of the high end modes of the fermion determinant .",
    "the goal is to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the infrared modes and to accelerate fermion simulations as well .",
    "in fact , all the computational effort needed to treat uv - modes by above algorithms can be reduced to zero by suppressing them in the first place @xcite .",
    "the lattice dirac operator of this fermion theory is given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the input lattice dirac operator , @xmath2 the lattice spacing and @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "for wilson ( w ) and overlap ( o ) fermions as the input theory one has @xmath4 .",
    "for staggered fermions @xmath5 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath6 on even / odd lattice sites .",
    "the theory converges to the input theory in the contimuum limit and is local and unitary as shown in detail in @xcite .",
    "the input theory is also recovered in the limit @xmath7 . for @xmath8 one",
    "has @xmath9 , i.e. a quenched theory .",
    "perturbative calculations with this theory are straightforward . in the following wilson fermions are used as input .",
    "the inverse fermion propagator is given by : @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the four - momentum vector .",
    "as usual , gauge fields are parametrized by @xmath12 elements , @xmath13 with @xmath14 algebra , and the wilson operator is written as a sum of the free and interaction terms : @xmath15 .",
    "the splitting of the lattice dirac operator is written in the same form : @xmath16 where the interaction term has to be determined .",
    "this can be done by expanding @xmath17 in terms of @xmath18 : @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are real expansion coefficients .",
    "calculation of @xmath21 is an easy task if one stays with a finite number of terms in the right hand side of ( [ pert_expan ] ) .",
    "also , the number of terms can be minimized using a chebyshev approximation for the hyperbolic tangent .",
    "the effective action of the theory defined above can be written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a real and smooth function of @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 is assumed to be hermitian and positive definite . since the trace is dificult to obtain one can use the stochastic method of @xcite .",
    "the method is based on evaluations of many bilinear forms of the type : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a random vector .",
    "the trace is estimated as an average over many bilinear forms .",
    "a confidence interval can be computed as described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "i will describe an alternative derivation of the lanczos algorithm @xcite , which is used in @xcite and in @xcite as well .",
    "the full details of this study can be found at @xcite .",
    "it uses familiar tools ( in lattice simulations ) such as sparse matrix invertions and pad approximats .",
    "the pad approximation of a smooth and bounded function @xmath29 in an interval can be expressed as a partial fraction expansion : @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "it is assumed that the right hand side converges to the left hand side when the number of partial fractions becomes large enough . for the bilinear form",
    "i obtain : @xmath32 a first algorithm may be derived at this point .",
    "having computed the partial fraction coefficients one can use a multi - shift iterative solver of @xcite to evaluate the right hand side ( [ partial_frac ] ) .",
    "the problem with this method is that one needs to store a large number of vectors that is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "this could be prohibitive if @xmath33 is say larger than @xmath34 . however , it is easy to save memory if only the bilinear form ( [ b_forms ] ) is needed ( see @xcite for details )",
    ".    if a pad approximation is not sufficient or difficult to obtain , the lanczos method is the only alternative to evaluate exactly the bilinear forms of type ( [ b_forms ] ) . to see how this is realized i assume that the linear system @xmath35 is solved to the desired accuracy using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the algorithm produces the coefficients of the lanczos matrix @xmath36 , which is symmetric and tridiagonal .",
    "its eigenvalues , the so called ritz values , tend to approximate the extreme eigenvalues of the original matrix @xmath26 . in the application considered here",
    "one can show that @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the identity matrix and @xmath39 is its first column . from this result and the convergence of the partial fractions to the matrix function @xmath29 ,",
    "it is clear that : @xmath40 note that the evaluation of the right hand side is a much easier task than the evaluation of the right hand side of ( [ b_forms ] ) .",
    "a straightforward method is the spectral decomposition of the symmetric and tridiagonal matrix @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues @xmath43 of @xmath36 and @xmath44 is the corrsponding matrix of eigenvectors , i.e. @xmath45 $ ] . from ( [ reduced_form ] ) and the spectral form @xmath41 it is easy to show that : @xmath46 where the function @xmath29 is now evaluated at individual eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric and tridiagonal matrix can be computed by the ql method with implicit shifts @xcite .",
    "the method has an @xmath47 complexity .",
    "fortunately , one can compute ( [ omega_form ] ) with only an @xmath48 complexity .",
    "closer inspection of eq .",
    "( [ omega_form ] ) shows that besides the eigenvalues , only the first elements of the eigenvectors are needed : @xmath49 it is easy to see that the ql method delivers the eigenvalues and first elements of the eigenvectors with @xmath48 complexity .",
    "a similar formula ( [ result_form ] ) is suggested by @xcite based on quadrature rules and lanczos polynomials .",
    "set @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 stop set @xmath58 , otherwise @xmath59 compute @xmath60 and @xmath61 by the ql method evaluate ( [ b_forms ] ) using ( [ result_form ] )    clearly , the lanczos algorithm , algorithm [ lambda_algor ] has @xmath62 complexity , but it delivers an exact evaluation of ( [ b_forms ] ) and for typical applications in lattice qcd the @xmath63 overhead is small .",
    "the method of @xcite computes the relative differences of ( [ result_form ] ) between two successive lanczos steps and stops if they do nt decrease below a given accuracy . in order to perform the test",
    "their algorithm needs to compute the eigenvalues of @xmath64 at each lanczos step @xmath65 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 where the convergence of the bilinear form ( [ b_forms ] ) and extreme eigenvalues of @xmath26 are plotted ."
