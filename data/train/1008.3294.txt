    "the localization of a non - interacting wave form in a disordered potential , predicted by anderson @xcite , has been the topic of vigorous research in different areas .",
    "localization has been observed experimentally in diverse contexts @xcite including bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated the localization of a cigar - shaped interacting @xmath2rb bec released into a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide with controlled disorder created by a laser speckle .",
    "_ @xcite observed the localization of a non - interacting @xmath3k bec in a bichromatic quasi - periodic optical - lattice ( ol ) potential created by superposing of two standing - wave polarized laser beams with incommensurate wavelengths .",
    "the non - interacting bec was created @xcite by tuning the atomic scattering length @xmath4 to zero near a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the disorder in a quasi - periodic ol potential is deterministic , in contrast to the complete disorder in a optical speckle potential .",
    "the localization in such a quasi - periodic potential is a special case of anderson localization in a fully disordered potential and is well described by the aubry - andr model @xcite .",
    "such a localization is often termed aubry - andr localization",
    ". however , these two mechanisms of localization are distinct .",
    "while anderson localization of wave functions with exponential tails is a pure quantum effect , the aubry - andr localization may occur in a classical phase space @xcite .",
    "the localization of a bec in a disordered potential has been the subject matter of various theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .    in the presence of strong",
    "disorder one has strong anderson localization @xcite , where the localized state could be quite similar to a localized state of gaussian shape in an infinite potential or a potential of very high barriers .",
    "then the quantum state can not escape the strong barriers of the disordered potential .",
    "however , the more interesting case of localization is in the presence of a weak disorder when the system is localized due to the quasi - periodic ( disordered ) nature of the potential @xcite and not due to the strength of the lattice .",
    "the localization takes place due to cancellation of waves coming after multiple scattering from many barriers of the random potential .",
    "when this happens the localized state acquires a pronounced exponential tail .",
    "the usual dilute bec with negligible dipole moment interacting via short - range interaction is described by the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "more recently , it has been possible @xcite to obtain a bec of @xmath0cr atoms with large dipole moment leading to a long - range dipole - dipole ( dipolar ) interaction superposed on the usual short - range interaction , which can be varied using a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "this allows to study the dipolar bec ( dbec ) of @xmath0cr atoms with variable short - range interaction @xcite . because of the anisotropic dipolar interaction",
    ", the dbec possesses many distinct features @xcite , which are under active investigation by different research groups @xcite . for example",
    ", the stability of a dbec depends not only on the value of the scattering length , but also strongly on the geometry of the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "a pancake - shaped trapping potential give a repulsive mean field of dipolar interaction and thus the dipolar condensate is more stable . in contrast , a cigar - shaped trapping potential yields an attractive mean - field of dipolar interaction and hence leading to a dipolar collapse @xcite .",
    "peculiarities in the collective low energy shape oscillations of dbec have been studied by yi and you @xcite .",
    "analogue of roton - maxon instability and the appearance of roton minimum in bogoliubov spectrum @xcite and angular collapse of dbec @xcite have been studied .",
    "numerical studies on the stability shows certain unusual structure of the hartree ground state of dipolar condensate in an anisotropic trap  @xcite .",
    "after the experiment @xcite on the localization of a 1d bec in a quasi - periodic trap , a natural extension of this phenomenon would be to achieve localization in two and three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite , both for a bec and a dbec .",
    "the theoretical description of a dilute weakly - interacting dbec can be formulated by including a dipolar interaction term in the gp equation maintaining the formal simplicity , nevertheless , increasing vastly the numerical complexity . using the numerical and variational solutions of the gp equation , we study the localization of a bec and a dbec in 3d , in the presence of bichromatic ol potentials along orthogonal directions .",
    "although the localized states have an exponential tail in a weak quasi - periodic potential , the central part of such localized states , responsible for the major contribution to the total density , may have a gaussian distribution . in the present paper we shall consider such localized states with an exponential tail and a gaussian central part , which can also be studied by the variational approximation .",
    "the variational approximation provides an analytical understanding of the localization and also yields interesting result when the numerical procedure is difficult to implement .",
    "such a variational gaussian approximation has successfully been applied to the localization of a bec without dipolar interaction in one @xcite , two and three dimensions @xcite in a bichromatic ol potential as well as a speckle potential @xcite in one dimension .    due to the angle dependence of the long - range dipolar interaction ,",
    "the localization of a dbec is more interesting than a bec with only a short - range interaction .",
    "the dipolar interaction is weak in the spherically - symmetric shape , is attractive in the cigar shape ( aligned dipoles arranged linearly attract each other ) and repulsive in the pancake shape ( aligned dipoles arranged side - by - side repeal each other ) @xcite . because of this",
    ", the trap configuration plays an essential role in the localization of a dbec . the controllable short - range interaction together with the exotic dipolar interaction makes the dbec an attractive system for experimental localization in a bichromatic ol potential and a challenging system for theoretical investigation allowing to study the interplay between the dipolar interaction and the short - range interaction in dipolar atoms .",
    "the cigar- and pancake - shaped localized dbec are obtained by considering bichromatic ol potentials of different strengths along the orthogonal directions .",
    "a localized dbec , without short - range interaction , can be achieved in a bichromatic ol trap for a small number of atoms by tuning @xcite the atomic scattering length to zero near a feshbach resonance @xcite . for a cigar - shaped dbec , without short - range interaction ,",
    "as the number of atoms increases it becomes highly attractive and suffers from collapse instability . in the presence of a repulsive short - range interaction ,",
    "the effect of the attractive dipolar interaction in the cigar shape can be compensated leading to a localized dbec for a small number of atoms ; delocalization may take place due to excess of repulsion for a large number of atoms .",
    "for a pancake - shaped dbec , the dipolar interaction is repulsive and a localized dbec is obtained for a small number of atoms . for a large number of atoms excess of repulsion should lead to delocalization . from a variational analysis of the localization of a dbec , a phase diagram illustrating its stability for different short - range interaction , number of atoms , and the geometry of the bichromatic ol",
    "to obtain localization , the short - range interaction should be small . as in 1d @xcite",
    ", a large repulsive short - range interaction destroys the localization and the localized state escapes to infinity in all cases .",
    "a large attractive short - range interaction leads to collapse instability and destroys the localization .    in sec .",

    "iv we present a brief summary of the present investigation .",

    "the numerical and variational energies of the dbec , as well as the corresponding densities are in reasonable agreement with each other . in the absence of a short - range interaction ,",
    "the localized dbec can accommodate the largest number of @xmath0cr atoms ( @xmath108 1000 ) in the spherical configuration and this number reduces both for cigar and pancake shapes due to the attractive and repulsive dipolar interaction , respectively .",
    "the attractive dipolar interaction leads to collapse and the repulsive dipolar interaction leads to leakage to infinity .",
    "we hope that this study will motivate experiments on the localization of a @xmath0cr dbec in a bichromatic ol trap .",
    "the estimate of the number of localized @xmath0cr atoms , their radial and axial sizes and shapes etc . as predicted in the present study can be verified in the experiment ."
