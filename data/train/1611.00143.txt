    "recently , there has been work on discretization of the above representations .",
    "bobenko , pinkall @xcite described discrete isothermic surfaces in the euclidean 3-space @xmath3 , and as an application , they derived the weierstrass representation for discrete isothermic minimal surfaces in @xmath3 , using integrable systems techniques .",
    "in the same vein , hertrich - jeromin @xcite gave the weierstrass - type representation for discrete isothermic cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath5 .",
    "burstall , hertrich - jeromin and the first author @xcite described discrete linear weingarten surfaces in any 3-dimensional spaceform using lie sphere geometry , which we briefly introduce in  [ secfive ] . using that method , we can treat discrete linear weingarten surfaces in any 3-dimensional spaceform .",
    "they did not consider singularities of discrete surfaces , however , as we will do here .    returning to smooth surfaces , unlike the minimal and ( non - zero ) cmc surfaces in @xmath3 , general linear weingarten surfaces will have singularities .",
    "in fact , singularities of maximal surfaces in @xmath4 , flat and brlw surfaces in @xmath5 , and bilw surfaces in @xmath6 are investigated in @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to still consider singularities when discretizing these surfaces .",
    "however , difficulties occur with this ( definition [ defnofsingvert ] ) , and overcoming those difficulties is our primary task here .",
    "hoffmann , sasaki , yoshida and the first author @xcite described discrete brlw surfaces in @xmath5 , and furthermore treated singularities of discrete flat surfaces in @xmath5 .",
    "for that , they considered the behavior of caustics of smooth flat surfaces at a singular point , via the weierstrass - type representation .",
    "such a caustic contacts the surface at a singular point , which lead to a natural definition of singularities in the discrete case , i.e. that a singularity of a discrete flat surface is a vertex that contacts the ( discrete ) caustic .",
    "we will define singular vertices in a more direct way that applies to a wider variety of discrete surfaces , and show equivalence of the definitions in the case considered just above ( theorem [ singvertflat ] ) .",
    "the second author @xcite described discrete maximal surfaces in the minkowski @xmath0-space @xmath4 and analyzed their singular faces , that is , non - spacelike faces ( definition [ defnofsingface ] ) .",
    "this is also a natural way to define singular behavior , because the tangent plane of a smooth maximal surface is non - spacelike precisely at singular points .",
    "thus , singularities of discrete surfaces could be either vertices or faces , and two of our primary results here are about relating those two viewpoints , in particular , in the cases of discrete maximal surfaces in @xmath4 and discrete cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath6 .",
    "smooth @xmath7-dimensional legendre immersions in lie sphere geometry project to surfaces in spaceforms that can have singularities .",
    "however , those surfaces considered together with their unit normal maps become immersions ( by definition ) , and they are called fronts .",
    "the most typical singularities on fronts are cuspidal edges of @xmath8 type , and next perhaps are swallowtails . at such singularities , exactly one of",
    "the principal curvatures will diverge ( see @xcite ) , and equivalently , one of the principal curvature spheres will become a point sphere . using that the notion of principal curvature spheres in lie sphere geometry is independent of the choice of projection to a @xmath0-dimensional spaceform",
    ", we define singular vertices on projections of discrete legendre immersions .    while typical singularities on smooth surfaces can be found by locating the points where one principal curvature blows out to infinity , on discrete surfaces the principal curvatures are discrete functions from the set of edges to the real numbers , and thus we can only identify the vertices at which a principal curvature changes sign . as a result , it is not so immediate to distinguish the points that are singular from the points that are parabolic ( at which exactly one of the two bounded principal curvature becomes zero ) or flat ( at which both principal curvatures become zero ) .",
    "this is why we will use a particular terminology `` fps vertices '' in definition [ defnofsingvert ] .",
    "this is the first of our three goals :    1",
    ".   we will find and examine cases where the distinction between singular and parabolic or flat points is possible .",
    "such cases include surfaces of constant gaussian curvature ( cgc ) @xmath9 ( see  [ singvertcgc ] ) , and some particular discrete linear weingarten surfaces for which weierstrass type representations exist (  [ secseven ] ,  [ seceight ] ,  [ secnine ] ) .",
    "2 .   we will confirm that the discrete weierstrass type representations are compatible with other ways of defining discrete surfaces with specific curvature properties .",
    "in particular , they are compatible with the definitions given by burstall , hertrich - jeromin and the first author in @xcite ( proposition [ consquanbrbi ] ) .",
    "3 .   we will find relationships between singular vertices and singular faces in particular cases ( theorem [ thm8pt4 ] , theorem [ thm7pt2next ] , corollary [ singfacevert ] ) .",
    "first we recall smooth legendre immersions in the context of lie sphere geometry , that is , maps @xmath10 of @xmath7-manifolds @xmath11 into the collection of null planes in @xmath12 , with metric signature @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",

    "item ( 3 ) implies any two or three vertices amongst @xmath67 span a @xmath7 or @xmath0 dimensional subspace of @xmath12 , respectively , with nondegenerate induced metric @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "generically , a smooth surface ( section ) @xmath40 will have a singularity when one of the principal curvature spheres @xmath52 becomes a point sphere @xcite , i.e. when @xmath76 for @xmath77 or @xmath7 .",
    "also , where @xmath48 does not have a singularity , it will have a parabolic or flat point if one of the @xmath52 becomes a tangent geodesic plane , i.e. @xmath78 .    in the case of discrete legendre immersions , the domain becomes @xmath61 , or some subdomain of @xmath61 , rather than @xmath11 .",
    "we define the curvature spheres as those spheres represented by nonzero vectors ( @xcite ) @xmath79 thus we have spheres in @xmath45 , associated to edges , that lie in both of the sphere pencils defined at the two endpoints of the edges . in particular the normal geodesics ( i.e. the geodesics through the vertices and perpendicular to the spheres in the sphere pencils ) emanating from the adjacent vertices , when they do intersect , will intersect at equal distances from the two vertices .    thus , @xmath80 will be defined on horizontal edges from vertex @xmath81 to vertex @xmath82 as the representative ( for a sphere ) that is common to both the null planes @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is defined analogously on vertical edges from @xmath60 to @xmath86 .",
    "we then define the principal curvatures by ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath87    as the principal curvature spheres @xmath52 and principal curvatures @xmath88 are defined on edges , not vertices , we lose the ability to look for points in the domain where @xmath52 is exactly perpendicular to @xmath36 or @xmath46 .",
    "thus we reformulate the conditions for singularities and parabolic or flat points by finding vertices in the domain at which the @xmath89 change sign in at least one direction :    [ defnofsingvert ] for a @xmath10 as in definition [ legliftdefn ] , together with a choice of spaceform determined from a choice of @xmath36 and @xmath46 , we say that @xmath90 is a _ flat - or - parabolic - or - singular ( fps ) vertex _ if @xmath91    , then we have either @xmath92 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 , @xmath95.,width=566 ]    when both @xmath36 and @xmath46 are non - null , switching @xmath36 and @xmath46 will result in the projected surface @xmath48 changing to its gauss map @xmath47 . in the smooth case , generically , a parabolic or flat point on one of the two surfaces corresponds to a singular point on the other , thus it is not surprising that these notions appear together in definition [ defnofsingvert ] .    in certain special cases",
    ", we can distinguish the singular points from the parabolic or flat points , which we will see here .",
    "as another approach for considering singularities on discrete surfaces , motivated by the second author s work @xcite , we can define singular faces .",
    "we come back to this in definition [ defnofsingface ] , and examine criteria for singular faces , and also their relationships with singular vertices in some special cases .",
    "we include this section to motivate the discretizations in  [ secfive ] . in @xmath96 with signature @xmath97 , with points @xmath98 described in matrix form as @xmath99 the metric is @xmath100 .",

    "then @xmath102 is a brlw surface in @xmath5 with unit normal vector field @xmath106 , since @xmath116 .",

    "this proves the next lemma , which was already understood in @xcite :    [ brandbilemma ] all smooth brlw and bilw surfaces in @xmath5 and @xmath6 are projections of @xmath2 surfaces with constant conserved quantities , at least one of which is lightlike .",
