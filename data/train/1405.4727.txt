    "both of these computations track attracting material surfaces , and hence are numerically robust .",
    "however , they involve the advection of lcs from two different initial times , and hence are necessarily preceded by two separate numerical advections of a dense enough grid of initial conditions . altogether , therefore , the computational cost of constructing both repelling and attracting lcs at arbitrary times @xmath4 $ ] has remained relatively high .",
    "here we propose a new computational strategy for two - dimensional incompressible flows .",
    "our strategy builds on results from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , enabling the reconstruction of all hyperbolic lcs for arbitrary times @xmath4 $ ] in a numerically robust fashion .",
    "this approach involves a single integration of trajectories from a full numerical grid , followed by the advection of select attracting material segments from local extrema of the singular value field of the flow gradient .",

    "this fact will simplify our upcoming computational algorithm considerably for incompressible flows .    as noted earlier , reconstructing a full forward - attracting lcs as a material line involves advecting its time @xmath1 position under the flow map .",
    "this is a self - stabilizing numerical process , as it tracks an attracting surface .",
    "in contrast , reconstructing a forward - repelling lcs from its time @xmath1 position by flow advection is an unstable numerical process .",
