    "[ eq : psiab ] , we assume that the biphoton amplitude is centered at times @xmath123",
    ". however , since the pairs are generated at random times under continuous - wave excitation , alice and bob do not know the center time of the biphoton envelope .",
    "therefore , alice and bob could use a prepare - and - measure scheme , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , in which alice directly measures the arrival time of her photon , sends this time to bob as a synchronization pulse , and then modulates the center time of the distribution that she sends to bob using a gaussian - distributed random number generator .",
    "in addition to enabling measurement of the covariance matrix , this technique allows alice to increase the photon generation rate .",
    "assuming alice has high system detection efficiency , she can determine if multiple pairs are emitted in each frame and remove them with an amplitude modulator .",
    "this heralding and post - selection scheme _ allows alice to send nearly one photon per frame with a low probability of sending multiple photons_. we find that the multi - pair probability can then be bounded below @xmath124 , even when the expected pair generation rate per frame , @xmath125 ( see derivation in appendix [ sec : heralding ] ) .",
    "this ability for efficient post - selection points to an important advantage of using high - dimensional encoding : for high @xmath121 , the purity of the single photon source after post - selection increases for a given pump power .",

    ", @xmath122 of this order is not difficult to measure .",
    "we have so far considered a passive selection of basis measurements by bob , using a beamsplitter followed by two single - photon detectors , as shown in fig .",
    "this number of detectors could be reduced to only one if the beam splitter were replaced by an active switch , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) additional detectors would be required to register instances in which multiple photons arrived at the detector within its reset time .",
    "in particular , detecting instances in which @xmath138 photon pairs are generated requires at least @xmath138 detectors .",
    "but this probability , which is given by the g - fold degenerate bose - einstein distribution ( see appendix b ) , rapidly diminishes with @xmath138 .",
    "thus , even for @xmath139 , only a few extra detectors would be required .",
    "the do - qkd protocol can therefore be very resource efficient , whereas other protocols that employ high - dimensional states in frequency @xcite or oam modes @xcite require a number of detectors that grows linearly with the dimensionality @xmath121 .",
    "it is interesting to consider why the do - qkd protocol can reach a much longer transmission length than continuous variable qkd ( cv - qkd ) protocols , which are so far limited to @xmath140 km @xcite .",
    "we believe that a primary reason for the shorter transmission length in cv - qkd is that @xmath70 and @xmath71 increase with photon loss / channel length .",
    "by contrast , in do - qkd , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constant with photon loss / channel length ( we believe that this would be the case for any single photon qkd protocol employing continuous variables ) .",
    "ultimately , the transmission length in do - qkd is limited not by an increase in the holevo information between alice and eve , but rather by a decrease in the mutual information between alice and bob ; @xmath112 decreases to zero with increasing channel length as the probability of registering a dark count approaches the probability of bob detecting a photon from alice .",
    "transmission @xmath141 km is realistic because the do - qkd protocol is ideally suited for fiber telecommunications networks and photonic integrated circuits ( pic ) , which are designed for high - bandwidth temporal encoding . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a protocol was proposed using pics for the efficient generation of single photons on - demand @xcite , and pics can be used to implement dispersive elements , as noted in sec .",
    "ii .    to further reduce the complexity of alice s setup",
    ", she could use an attenuated classical source instead of an entangled photon source . as in pulse position modulation ( ppm )",
    ", alice would simply modulate the optical field to generate random code - words .",
    "two switches could then be used for randomly transforming the ppm signals into one of the temporal bases before sending them onward to bob ( note that the loss introduced by these switches can be compensated by increasing the light intensity ) .",
    "note that alice no longer requires a photon detector in this implementation : she only needs a modulated light source and dispersive optics .",
    "this attenuated - light implementation could be paired with a decoy state protocol @xcite to protect against photon number splitting attacks .    for channel bandwidths of @xmath142 ,",
    "do - qkd can operate at the heisenberg measurement limit , while for larger bandwidths , dense wavelength division multiplexing ( dwdm ) could allow operation on hundreds of independent wavelength channels .",
    "we have introduced a scheme to perform high - dimensional qkd to maximize the key generation rate given experimental limitations such as detector reset time or finite brightness of entangled photon sources .",
    "because the protocol relies on temporal correlations , it is ideally suited for fiber communication systems .",
    "it is also resource efficient and can be implemented with as few as two detectors using entangled photon pairs .",
    "if alice used ppm and dispersion , only bob would require a single photon detector .",
    "the do - qkd protocol allows the generation of @xmath0 bpc with communication rates exceeding @xmath143 mb / s and communication distances over @xmath1 km .",
    "we show that this protocol is secure against collective attacks .",

    "<S> the security of the protocol relies on measurements by alice and bob in one of two conjugate bases , implemented using dispersive optics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this dispersion - based approach is secure against collective attacks . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol is additionally compatible with standard fiber telecommunications channels and wavelength division multiplexers . </S>",
    "<S> we describe several physical implementations to enhance the transmission rate and describe a heralded qudit source that is easy to implement and enables secret - key generation at @xmath0 bits per character of distilled key across over @xmath1 km of fiber . </S>"
