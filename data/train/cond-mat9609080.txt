    "one of the most interesting aspects of electron transport in submicron scale devices is the interplay between quantum coherence and aperiodic but reproducible conductance fluctuations . over the past decade",
    "the phenomenon of universal conductance fluctuations in disordered systems ( where impurity scattering dominates ) has been understood through the use of stochastic models .",
    "more recently , a new generation of experiments @xcite was designed to measure conductance fluctuations in the ballistic regime where the dynamics of the electrons in the device is determined by the geometry of its boundary .",
    "the stochastic approach to these systems is justified by the underlying classical chaotic dynamics .",
    "this situation is distinct from the diffusive case , where the corresponding classical limit of the quantum problem is not fully understood .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the conductance fluctuations in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite these are semiconductor devices in which the electrons are confined to a two - dimensional region whose typical linear dimension is in the submicron range .",
    "in particular we are interested in the coulomb blockade regime where the leads are weakly coupled to the dot , either because the leads are very narrow , or due to the presence of potential barriers at the lead - dot interface .",
    "@xcite the electrons inside the dot are characterized by isolated resonances whose width is smaller than their average spacing , and conductance occurs through resonant tunneling . as a consequence , the conductance peaks when the fermi energy matches a resonance energy of the electrons inside the dot and an additional electron tunnels into the dot .",
    "such a system resembles the compound nucleus in its region of isolated resonances .",
    "@xcite the macroscopic charging energy required to add an electron to a dot is determined by its capacitance @xmath0 and is given by @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath0 is a constant which is determined essentially by the geometry of the dot , the conductance exhibits equally spaced oscillations as a function of the gate voltage ( or fermi energy ) . at low temperatures @xmath2",
    "the width of the conductance peaks is @xmath3 , but the heights exhibit order of magnitude variations .",
    "@xcite    when the electron - impurity mean free path is larger than the size of the dot , the classical dynamics of the electron inside the dot is determined by the scattering from the dot s boundary . due to small irregularities in the dot s shape ,",
    "the electron displays chaotic motion , and its quantum transport through the dot can be described by statistical @xmath4-matrix theory.@xcite since the coulomb blockade regime is dominated by resonances , the conductance peaks can be used to probe the chaoticity of the underlying resonance wavefunctions . a statistical theory of the conductance peaks was originally developed in ref . .",
    "by using @xmath5-matrix theory , @xcite the conductance peak amplitude was expressed in terms of the electronic resonance wavefunction across the contact region between the dot and the leads .",
    "when the dynamics of the electron inside the dot is chaotic , the fluctuations of the wavefunction inside the dot are assumed to be well described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) . in ref .",
    "the conductance distribution was derived in closed form for one - channel leads .",
    "these results were rederived in ref .",
    ", and later extended to the case of two - channel leads in the absence of time - reversal symmetry @xcite through the use of the supersymmetry technique.@xcite however , the calculations required by this technique become too complicated to apply in the general case of any number of possibly correlated and/or non - equivalent channels",
    ".    the conductance distributions for one - channel leads were recently measured @xcite and found to be in agreement with theory for both cases of conserved and broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this indicates that the dephasing effect , which plays an important role in open dots , @xcite is of little importance for closed dots .    in this paper",
    "we discuss in detail the width and conductance peak distributions for leads with any number of channels that are in general correlated and non - equivalent .",
    "exact closed expressions for these distributions are derived for both cases of conserved and broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite we find that these distributions are entirely characterized by the eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the left and right leads , respectively .",
    "the strength of our approach is in its simplicity , since it relies solely on standard rmt techniques . to test our predictions we compare our analytical findings to numerical simulations of a chaotic dynamical model , the conformal billiard .",
    "@xcite statistical width and conductance distributions of one - channels leads were recently studied in detail in this model .",
    "@xcite although our paper deals mainly with ballistic dots whose classical dynamics is chaotic , our results should also be valid in the diffusive regime of weakly disordered dots , where random matrix theory is applicable .",
    "we note that under certain conditions the partial width is analogous to the wavefunction intensity at a given point",
    ". therefore our width distributions can also be tested by microwave cavity experiments,@xcite where the intensities are measured at several points that are spatially correlated .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we briefly review the conductance in quantum dots in their coulomb blockade regime . in section iii",
    "we discuss the statistical model and derive analytic results for the partial and total width distributions in each lead , for the channel correlation matrix and for the conductance distribution .",
    "we investigate the variation of these distributions as a function of the number of channels and their sensitivity to the degree of correlations between them .",
    "those findings are compared in section iv with numerical results obtained for the conformal billiard . finally , in section v we discuss the validity of our assumptions in the the context of typical experiments .",
    "in this section we briefly review the formalism and introduce the notation used throughout this paper .",
    "in particular , we express the conductance peak heights in terms of the channel and resonance wavefunctions of the dot .    for @xmath8 , which is typical of many experiments , @xcite the observed on resonance conductance peak amplitude",
    "is given by @xcite    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the partial decay width of the resonance @xmath11 into the left ( right ) lead .",
    "since each lead can support several open channels we have @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the partial width to decay into channel @xmath14 in the left ( right ) lead .    in the @xmath5-matrix formalism , @xcite",
    "the partial widths are related to the resonance wavefunction inside the dot . more specifically , introducing the partial amplitudes @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 , one can write @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the @xmath11th resonance wavefunction in the dot",
    ", @xmath19 is the transverse wavefunction in the lead that corresponds to an open channel @xmath14 , and the integral is taken over the contact area between the lead and the dot . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the longitudinal wavenumber and penetration factor in channel @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "( [ gamdefr ] ) shows that the contributions to the partial width amplitude from the internal and external regions of the dot factorize .",
    "the information from the region external to the dot is contained in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these quantities are determined by the wave dynamics in the leads and are non - universal .",
    "they affect the average widths and enter explicitly in the correlation matrix @xmath22",
    ". however , the fluctuation properties of the conductance are generic and depend only on the statistical properties of the electronic wavefunction at the dot - lead boundary inside the barrier region .    a different physical modeling of a quantum dot assumes point - like contacts and each lead is composed of several such point contacts .",
    "@xcite in this model the conductance is also given by ( [ gamdefr ] ) with each point contact @xmath23 considered as one channel .",
    "the corresponding partial width is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the area of the dot , @xmath26 is the mean spacing and @xmath27 is a dot - lead coupling parameter .",
    "both models can be treated by our formalism .",
    "this becomes apparent after the following considerations .",
    "a resonance eigenfunction with eigenenergy @xmath28 can be approximated by an expansion in a fixed basis @xmath29 of wavefunctions with the given energy @xmath30 inside the dot @xmath31 the sum over @xmath32 is truncated at @xmath33 basis states , where @xmath33 is large and determined by precision requirements .",
    "the partial width in channel @xmath14 can then be expressed by the scalar product @xmath34 where @xmath35 for the extended leads model , and @xmath36 for the point contact model .",
    "thus , we are led to similar formulations of both the extended leads and point - like contacts problems ; in the corresponding @xmath33-dimensional space the partial width amplitudes of a level are simply the projections of its corresponding eigenstate vector @xmath37 on the channel vectors @xmath38 .",
    "the only difference between the two models is the explicit expression for the channel vector @xmath38 .",
    "we note that the scalar product ( [ 5 ] ) ( that will be used throughout this paper ) is different from the original scalar product defined in the spatial region extended by the dot .",
    "due to the irregularity of the dot s shape , the motion of the electron inside the dot is expected to be chaotic . in ref .",
    "we have developed a statistical theory of the conductance peaks by assuming that the vectors @xmath39 that correspond to the resonance wavefunctions inside the dot have the same statistical properties as the eigenvectors of a random matrix ensemble .",
    "here we study the limits of conserved time - reversal symmetry , corresponding to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , and of broken time - reversal symmetry , corresponding to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "the transition from one symmetry to another occurs when an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "the width distribution ( or equivalently the wavefunction intensity distribution ) was derived in the crossover regime between symmetries for the case of one channel leads only .",
    "@xcite      in rmt the eigenvector @xmath40 ( here and in the following we omit the eigenvector label @xmath11 ) is distributed randomly @xcite on a sphere @xmath41 . the joint distribution of the partial width amplitudes @xmath42 for @xmath43 channels is then given by @xmath44 \\left[\\prod_{c=1}^{\\lambda }     \\delta ( \\gamma_c - \\langle\\bbox{\\phi}_c|\\bbox{\\psi}\\rangle ) \\right ]     \\delta \\!\\left ( \\sum_{\\mu=1}^n |\\psi_\\mu |^2 -1 \\right ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 \\equiv \\prod_{\\mu=1}^{n}{d\\psi_\\mu}$ ] for the goe and",

    "these corrections are negligible if one averages over all orientations around a given point @xmath185 , keeping the modulus @xmath186 fixed , but this is difficult to implement experimentally . at a fixed orientation the fluctuations of the spatial correlations seem to be rather small if @xmath187 so that ( [ 17 ] ) is a good approximation . for larger values of @xmath188 , there could be significant fluctuations from ( [ 17 ] ) but in this region the width and conductance distributions are closer to their limiting case of independent channels and are not very sensitive to the exact correlations .",
    "our results were obtained by using the billiard eigenfunctions with neumann boundary conditions where the normal derivative of the wavefunctions vanishes on the boundaries .",
    "we analyze eigenfunctions in the vicinity of the 100@xmath189 excited level which resembles the experimental situation . by moving the points around the circle we generate more statistics and average over orientations .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where the correlations in the model ( solid line ) compare well with the theoretical result ( dashed line ) for both cases with and without magnetic flux .",
    "the agreement is fair , particularly for @xmath190 . for @xmath191 , the deviations from the theoretical value of @xmath81 are not important since the channels are weakly correlated and the distributions are very close to those describing uncorrelated channels .",
    "thus , corrections to our analytical findings should not be large , as is supported by the numerical evidence presented below .    in our model studies we imposed neumann boundary conditions around the entire billiard and not just at the dot - lead boundary .",
    "to mimic the experimental situation we would have to impose mixed boundary conditions , @xcite which makes the calculations much more computationally intensive .",
    "however , we now argue that our simplified situation still provides reasonable results . for extended leads , the length of the dot - lead contact region @xmath192 must satisfy @xmath193 in order to support open transverse channels ( in dots containing several hundred electrons ) .",
    "therefore , deviations from @xmath81 at the edge of the dot - lead contact region ( where our boundary conditions are unrealistic ) are averaged out . for point - like contacts ,",
    "the physical picture is that the conductance is probing the wavefunction in the vicinity of the constriction ( the region that couples the dot to the external lead ) .",
    "we then need to know the characteristic properties of the wavefunction inside the dot where our model is quite satisfactory .",
    "we first studied the point - like contacts model by describing the lead as a sequence of @xmath43 equally spaced points on the boundary of the billiard ( in the @xmath194-plane ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) the correlation matrix @xmath22 is then completely determined by latexmath:[$k |\\delta \\bbox{r}| \\approx k\\delta\\theta    angle that spans the arc between two neighboring points in the @xmath165-plane ) and @xmath43 . in this model",
    "it is easy to generate strong correlations by choosing the points close enough , unlike the ( discretized ) anderson model @xcite where the channels are weakly correlated even if the lead is composed of nearest neighboring points .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath98 are found by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath22 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we compare for the unitary and orthogonal limits , respectively , the total width distribution @xmath87 obtained by solving the conformal billiard ( histograms ) with the theoretical predictions ( solid lines ) , for several values of @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the distributions @xmath144 for equivalent and uncorrelated channels are indicated by the dashed lines , and are just the @xmath117 distributions in @xmath43 ( @xmath119 ) degrees of freedom for the goe ( gue ) .",
    "the agreement between the model and the analytic rmt predictions confirms the validity of the statistical model for a chaotic dot .",
    "we observe from figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] that for the larger values of @xmath198 , the distributions get closer to those for uncorrelated channels .",
    "this is consistent with the decrease in spatial correlations ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "another interesting observation is that , for a constant @xmath199 ( _ i.e. _ fixed correlations ) , the deviation from the limiting case of independent channels becomes larger with an increasing number of channels .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] show a comparison between the theoretical conductance peaks distributions for symmetric leads , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ pggue ] ) and ( [ pggoe ] ) for the unitary and orthogonal cases , respectively , and those calculated for the africa billiard with symmetric @xmath43-point leads ( @xmath200 , and 6 ) and for different values of @xmath140 .",
    "the dashed lines are again the limiting case of uncorrelated and equivalent leads .",
    "observations that are similar to the ones made above for the width distributions , can be made with respect to the conductance peaks distributions . comparing the width and conductance peaks distributions",
    ", we note that the conductance distribution shows stronger deviation from its limit for uncorrelated equivalent channels than does the width distribution .",
    "we also studied extended leads by taking the contact region of the lead and the dot to have a finite length @xmath201 on the dot s boundary ( in the @xmath194-plane ) where @xmath202 is evaluated at the corresponding angle where the lead is located . in this case the channels are defined by the allowed quantized transverse momenta @xmath203 with @xmath204 , where @xmath205 $ ] . to calculate the partial amplitude for the conformal billiard , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ gamdefr ] ) ( defined in the @xmath194-plane ) is mapped into an integral along an arc in the @xmath165-plane which is spanned by an angle @xmath206    @xmath207    where @xmath208 are the transverse channel wavefunction and for simplicity we have set @xmath209 .",
    "the resonance eigenfunction @xmath210 is given in terms of its expansion in @xmath211 ( with @xmath212    @xmath213    where @xmath214 is a normalization constant , @xmath215 are the zeros of @xmath216 and @xmath217 are expansion coefficients as in ref . .",
    "to guarantee that the correlation matrix @xmath22 in ( [ 8 ] ) is the same for eigenfunctions of the billiard which belong to different energies , we choose @xmath192 such that @xmath218 and scale the partial amplitude ( [ gamdefr ] ) by @xmath219 .",
    "the resulting matrix is    @xmath220    this scaling is desirable in order to be consistent with the theoretical approach presented above , but experimentally it is very hard to accomplish .",
    "fortunately , this scaling of @xmath192 is insignificant for present experiments @xcite that deal with dots containing several hundred electrons @xmath221 .",
    "indeed , from the weyl formula we have @xmath222 so that @xmath223 .",
    "the latter inequality is obtained when we estimate @xmath224 to be the number of observed coulomb blockade peaks ( since each coulomb blockade peak corresponds to the addition of one electron into the dot ) .",
    "the relative variation of @xmath225 is thus small and can be neglected .",
    "we find that the channels in the extended leads model are weakly correlated and that the average partial widths in the various channels exhibit a moderate variation .",
    "in such a case the total width distribution is not very different from the case of uncorrelated equivalent channels .",
    "our model calculations for extended leads are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and are in agreement with the rmt predictions for uncorrelated channels ( dashed lines ) .",
    "an interesting effect is that with an increasing number of channels even small deviations in @xmath87 give rise to relatively large deviations in @xmath145 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig11]d .",
    "we have discussed both the cases of orthogonal and unitary symmetries . to relate to actual experimental situations ,",
    "it is important to estimate the minimal strength of the magnetic field @xmath226 which ensures complete time - reversal symmetry breaking . for a ballistic electron @xcite @xmath227 , where @xmath228 and @xmath229 are , respectively , the time it takes the electron to cross the dot and the heisenberg time @xmath230 . for an electron at the fermi energy @xmath231 , where @xmath221 is the number of electrons in the dot .",
    "the proportionality factor is non - universal and depends on the exact geometry of the dot . in a semiclassical analysis@xcite",
    "it can be expressed in terms of classical quantities .",
    "for the dots used in some recent experiments , @xcite @xmath226 is of order of a few mt .",
    "such small values of @xmath226 do not alter significantly the classical dynamics of the electron,@xcite and our assumption that the correlation @xmath183 is unchanged is justified . nevertheless , these small variations in the magnetic field have appreciable quantum mechanical effects , _ i.e. _ the crossover from orthogonal to unitary symmetry .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have derived closed expressions for the width and conductance peak distributions in quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the main assumption is that the electron s dynamics is chaotic for a ballistic dot or weakly diffusive for a disordered dot . for given correlation matrices that characterize the left and right leads , these distributions are universal and distinct for conserved and broken time - reversal symmetry .",
