    "intensive experimental studies of highly - excited nuclei during the last two decades have produced many data on the evolution of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) as a function of temperature @xmath0 and spin .",
    "the data show that the gdr width increases sharply with increasing @xmath0 from @xmath4 1 mev up to @xmath5 3 mev . at higher @xmath0 a width saturation",
    "has been reported ( see @xcite for the most recent review ) .",
    "the increase of the gdr width with @xmath0 is described reasonably well within the thermal shape - fluctuation model  @xcite and the phonon damping model ( pdm )  @xcite .",
    "the thermal shape - fluctuation model assumes an adiabatic coupling of gdr to quadrupole degrees of freedom with deformation parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 induced by thermal fluctuations and high spins in the intrinsic frame of reference .",
    "although this model shows an increase of the gdr width with @xmath0 comparable with the experimental systematic at 1.2 @xmath8 3 mev , the gdr shapes generated using the strength function of this model differ significantly from the experimental ones  @xcite .",
    "the pdm considers the coupling of the gdr to @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations at @xmath11 0 as the mechanism of the width increase and saturation .",
    "the pdm calculates the gdr width and strength function directly in the laboratory frame without any need for an explicit inclusion of thermal fluctuation of shapes .",
    "the pdm reproduces fairly well both of the observed width  @xcite and shape  @xcite of the gdr at @xmath11 0 .    in general ,",
    "pairing was neglected in the calculations for hot gdr as it was believed that the gap vanishes at @xmath12 1 mev according to the temperature bcs theory .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that thermal fluctuations smear out the superfluid - normal phase transition in finite systems so that the pairing gap survives up to @xmath13 1 mev .",
    "this has been confirmed microscopically in the recent modified hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory at finite @xmath0  @xcite , whose limit is the modified - bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "other approaches such as the static - path approximation  @xcite , shell model calculations  @xcite , as well as the exact solution of the pairing problem @xcite also show that pairing correlations do not abruptly disappear at @xmath11 0 .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the decrease of the pairing gap with increasing @xmath0 , which is also caused by @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations at low @xmath0 , may slow down the increase of the gdr width . by including a simplified @xmath0-dependent pairing gap in the cascade calculations using the pdm strength functions , ref .",

    "@xcite concluded that the narrow width observed in @xmath1sn at low @xmath0 is not understood .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that it is thermal pairing that causes the narrow gdr width in @xmath1sn at low @xmath0 . for this purpose",

    "therefore we discuss here only the final equations , which will be used in numerical calculations . according to this formalism the gdr width @xmath18 is presented as the sum of quantal ( @xmath19 ) and thermal ( @xmath20 ) widths as  @xcite    [ width ] @xmath21 @xmath22^{2}(1-n_{p}-n_{h } ) \\delta(e_{\\rm gdr}-e_{p}-e_{h})~ , \\label{gammaq}\\ ] ] @xmath23^{2}(n_{s'}-n_{s } )",

    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) of ref .",
    "however , as the maximum of these terms is located at negative energy @xmath67 0 , and @xmath68 0 , respectively , their contribution to the gdr , which is located at @xmath69 1 mev , is negligible .",

    "the assumption of a constant coupling strength is well justified when the width of a collective mode is much smaller than the energy range @xmath82 ( of order of @xmath60 ) over which this mode is coupled to the background states ( the so - called weak coupling limit discussed in refs .",

    "\\ii ) it is well established that the microscopic mechanism of the quantal ( spreading ) width @xmath19 ( [ gammaq ] ) comes from quantal coupling of @xmath32 configurations to more complicated ones , such as @xmath83 ones .",
    "the calculations performed in refs . @xcite within two independent microscopic models , where such couplings to @xmath83 configurations were explicitly included , have shown that @xmath19 depends weakly on @xmath0 . the microscopic study in ref .",

    "it also indicated that the width of a collective vibration does not depend on the detailed coupling to the compound nuclear eigenstates .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid complicate numerical calculations , which are not essential for the increase of @xmath18 at @xmath11 0 , such microscopic mechanism is not included within pdm , assuming that @xmath19 at @xmath3 0 is known .",

    "the pdm calculations in fact have shown that @xmath19 decreases from 4.9 mev at @xmath3 0 to around 2.5 mev at @xmath3 5 mev for @xmath1sn due to thermal effects in the factor @xmath85 ( see the dashed line in fig .",

    "a large width one expects a considerable change of the level density of background states . to be quantitatively precise",
    ", one needs to use a self - consistent theory for the strength function , which includes the coupling to doorway states as in ref . @xcite .",
    "such theory is valid for any ratio of @xmath88 .",
    "however , from assumption ( ii ) it also follows that the increase of @xmath18 is now driven mainly by the thermal width @xmath20 due to the factor @xmath89 .",
    "the change of @xmath45 implies a change of the quasiparticle entropy @xmath90 .",
    "the latter is ultimately related to the change of the level density of background states within the realistic mean - field basis .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the complexity of the background states is measured by the information entropy @xmath91 of individual wave functions , which reflects the complicated relationship between the eigenbasis and representation basis . meanwhile ,",
    "the thermodynamic entropy @xmath92 of the total system is directly determined by its statistical weight @xmath93 as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the level density . in a situation with incomplete information , such as in the statistical description of hot nuclei considered here ,",
    "individual compound systems are replaced with a grand canonical ensemble of nuclei in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the probability for a quantum system to have a given eigenenergy is determined by the density matrix @xmath96 rather than by a pure wave function .",
    "the expectation value @xmath97 of an observable @xmath98 is given as the statistical average over the grand canonical ensemble @xmath99 , which is derived from the maximum of the thermodynamic entropy @xmath100 .",
    "the modern shell - model calculations in ref . @xcite have shown that these three apparently different entropies , @xmath90 , @xmath101 , and @xmath92 , behave very similarly for the majority of states in the realistic mean field consistent with residual interactions ( see column ii of fig .",
    "56 in ref . @xcite and the discussion therein ) .",
    "significant differences between them take place only when the residual interaction beyond the mean field is very weak ( see column i of fig .",
    "56 in @xcite ) or when the quasiparticle mean - field is absent ( @xmath91 reaches its chaotic limit ) ( see column iii of fig . 56 in @xcite )",
    ". this might be the reason why the numerical results performed so far within the zero - pairing pdm  @xcite using assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) fit fairy well the experimental systematic for the gdr width including the existing data on the width saturation at @xmath4 3 mev .",
    "this is partly also due to the large experimental errorbars for the extracted gdr width at high @xmath0 ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "therefore , at @xmath4 3 mev the results obtained under these assumptions should be considered as qualitative .",
    "this does not affect our present study of the pairing effect as the latter is significant only at low temperature ( @xmath102 2.5 mev ) .    within assumptions ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "the model has only three @xmath0-independent parameters , which are the unperturbed phonon energy @xmath62 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath80 are chosen so that after the @xmath32-gdr coupling is switched on , the calculated gdr energy @xmath60 and width @xmath18 reproduce the corresponding experimental values for gdr on the ground - state . at @xmath11 0 , the coupling to @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations is activated .",
    "the @xmath81 parameter is then fixed at @xmath3 0 so that the gdr energy @xmath60 does not change appreciably with varying @xmath0 .",
    "the values of the pdm parameters for @xmath1sn are given in @xcite for the zero - pairing case .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have presented an argument that , in our opinion , the effect due to coupling of gdr to noncollective @xmath32 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations at @xmath11 0 within the pdm is tantamount to that of thermal shape fluctuations .",
    "this has been demonstrated by expanding the coupling of gdr phonon to noncollective @xmath32 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 configurations into couplings to different multipole fields ( see pages 437 and 438 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this expansion the @xmath9 ( @xmath10)-pair operator @xmath103",
    "is expanded in terms of the tensor products of two @xmath32-pair operators ( see mappings ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) of ref .",
    "each @xmath32-pair operator @xmath104 can be then expressed in terms of the rpa phonon operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 with rpa amplitudes @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "components of residual interaction .",
    "this means that coupling to @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations already includes in principle the coupling to different multipole - multipole fields via multiphonon configuration mixing at @xmath11 0 .. the calculations with the gdr coupled to the first quadrupole phonon @xmath118 required the energy @xmath119 and the ratio @xmath120 @xmath121 to be fixed as additional parameters . a similar quality for the description of the experimental data for the temperature dependence of the gdr width has been restored after a reduction of the dipole matrix elements @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "]    cascade calculations using pdm strength functions have produced the gdr shapes in good agreement with the experimental data for @xmath1sn at @xmath124 1.54 mev ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "the discrepancy at @xmath17 1.54 mev is due to omission or improperly inclusion of pairing at low @xmath0 , which is now studied in the present work .",

    "these evidences are in favor of the argument discussed above and in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we recognize that the issue of whether coupling to @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations at @xmath11 0 is a microscopic ( although indirect ) interpretation of thermal shape fluctuations within the pdm is still not settled . the question on whether thermal shape fluctuations need to be included additionally within pdm or not remains to be investigated .",
    "the thermal shape - fluctuation model calculates the time - correlation function of the gdr by replacing the micro - canonical ensemble with an ensemble of macroscopic variables , which are the deformation parameters @xmath126 in the body - fixed ( principal axes ) frame of reference ( intrinsic frame ) .",
    "it parametrizes a priori the dipole correlation tensor by a frequency @xmath127 $ ] and a width equal to @xmath128 along each @xmath129th semiaxis  @xcite .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations in this model is included via fluctuations of shapes by employing the macroscopic landau theory of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an explicit inclusion of thermal shape fluctuations in the pdm will bring in additional degrees of freedom , which increase the number of parameters of the model . at the same time , in a way similar to that mentioned in the footnote above , this will certainly require a renormalization of the existing parameters of the pdm to restore the agreement with the experimental systematic .",
    "while this issue is left open for future study , it does not affect the study of the role of thermal pairing in the present paper , since , as will be seen below , in order to describe the gdr width at low @xmath0 , thermal pairing is necessary to be included in any model , whether it is the pdm or thermal shape - fluctuation one .",

    "the gap @xmath37 ( solid line ) does not vanish , but decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath0 at @xmath4 1 mev resulting in a long tail up to @xmath16 5 mev .",
