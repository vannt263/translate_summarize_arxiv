    "this simple picture , to be called the low - nussinov pomeron in the following , has been refined in subsequent years in terms of regeizzed gluon ladders leading to the lipatov hard pomeron  @xcite .",
    "one of the defining features of diffractive scattering is the pattern of final state hadrons . in a collider configuration hadronization",
    "occurs in narrow cones around the beam directions while the central rapidity region is free of produced hadrons ( rapidity gap )",
    ". the same phenomenon has recently been observed in _",
    "hard _ scattering events at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration has studied a sample of dijet events with jet transverse energies in excess of 30 gev . in about @xmath2% of all events with widely separated jets",
    "no sign of hadronic activity is observed between the two jets .",
    "this observation is consistent with predictions for rapidity gap event rates within the pomeron model  @xcite .",
    "bjorken estimated the size of the low - nussinov pomeron exchange contribution and found that a fraction @xmath3% of all dijet events should be due to this mechanism .",
    "the other factor in his estimate is the `` survival probability '' @xmath4 ,  the probability that the underlying event does not fill the rapidity gap which is present at the parton level .",
    "the survival probability is expected to be of order 10% at the tevatron , with large uncertainties  @xcite , leading to a rapidity gap fraction @xmath5 , as compared to the observation at the 0.005 level .",
    "both pomeron and @xmath0-channel photon exchange are believed to lead to rapidity gaps since both scattering processes proceed via the exchange of a @xmath0-channel color singlet object . in the case of @xmath6 exchange in forward @xmath7 scattering",
    ", color coherence  @xcite between initial and final state gluon radiation is known to lead to an exponentially suppressed gluon emission probability into the rapidity region between the two final state quarks  @xcite .",
    "after hadronization this translates into suppressed hadronic activity between the two quark jets , thus allowing the formation of a rapidity gap .",
    "due to its color singlet structure one expects that the same would occur for the @xmath0-channel exchange of a pomeron .",
    "however , since the low - nussinov pomeron is an extended object with colored constituents , the validity of this analogy is not obvious : gluon radiation may resolve the internal color structure of the pomeron .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the conditions ( if any ) under which gluon emission between the two final state quarks is suppressed in the pomeron exchange process .",
    "this radiation pattern is necessary for the interpretation of the sizable rate of rapidity gap events observed by d0 since electroweak processes alone , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath0-channel @xmath6 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 exchange , have too small a cross section to account for the observed rate  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the gluon radiation pattern for the imaginary part of the @xmath0-channel exchange of two gluons in quark - quark scattering .",
    "there are practical reasons why we do not attempt a full calculation .",
    "the lowest order cross section for gluon radiation in two gluon color singlet exchange is of order @xmath10 and hence the full calculation corresponds to a two - loop evaluation of 3-jet production at hadron colliders , which is clearly beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "instead , we aim at a qualitative understanding of the radiation pattern only .",
    "since the imaginary part of the amplitude is known to dominate over the real part in forward , elastic quark - quark scattering via pomeron exchange  @xcite , the imaginary part of the emission process should be sufficient for our purposes .    the gluon radiation pattern for color singlet two - gluon exchange",
    "is then compared to the ones obtained for ( color singlet ) @xmath6 exchange and for ( color octet ) gluon exchange . for the exchange of a low - nussinov pomeron",
    "we find that the angular distribution of a single radiated gluon can be described in terms of three components : a qed - like contribution which is consistent with the formation of rapidity gaps , a qcd like term with gluon emission in the backwards direction , and a collinear term which describes @xmath11 splitting and subsequent pomeron exchange between the gluon and the second quark .",
    "for the emission of gluons at low transverse momentum the qed - like component is much larger than the qcd - like one .",
    "since these soft gluons dominate the overall gluon radiation , hadronization will produce a pattern similar to the one expected for @xmath0-channel photon exchange .",
    "therefore pomeron exchange should indeed lead to the formation of rapidity gaps in hard scattering events .",
    "for those willing to extrapolate to low @xmath12 this finding gives further credence to a qcd explanation also of the soft pomeron .",
    "the main part of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the most general color structure of the @xmath13 process .",
    "two of the terms in the color decomposition define what we mean by `` color singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel '' .",
    "we then apply this decomposition to the tree level photon and single gluon exchange processes , which are later needed for comparison , and discuss their radiation patterns .",
    "section  iii is technical and describes our calculation of the imaginary part of @xmath13 scattering via two gluon exchange . the resulting radiation pattern is then discussed in section  iv and section  v gives our conclusions .",
    "we start by analyzing the color structure and the resulting gluon radiation patterns for the scattering of two quarks of different flavor at tree level .",
    "the amplitudes for single gluon and single photon exchange already exhibit the full color structure of the process @xmath14 and these results will be needed later for comparison with pomeron exchange .",
    "we thus study the process @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the quark and gluon momenta and their colors are labeled by @xmath18 and @xmath19 . scattering involving anti - quarks",
    "is related by crossing and we do not consider processes with initial state gluons .    in general , the amplitude of the @xmath14 process can be written in terms of four orthogonal color tensors , which we denote by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 in an @xmath25 gauge theory they are given explicitly by @xmath26 @xmath22 marks the process where the quark @xmath27 keeps its color .",

    "shown is the dependence of @xmath37 on the rapidity of the emitted gluon when all other phase space parameters are kept fixed , namely the two quarks are held at @xmath38  gev and pseudorapidities @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the gluon transverse momentum is chosen to be @xmath41  gev .",
    "the details of this choice are irrelevant : forward scattering of the two quarks is a sufficient condition to obtain the qualitative radiation pattern of fig .",
    "[ qedqcdtree ] . in the qcd case",
    "the color octet contributions , via the non - abelian amplitude @xmath42 , lead to enhanced gluon emission in the angular region between the two jets . for @xmath0-channel photon exchange",
    "this region is essentially free of gluons due to color coherence between initial and final state gluon radiation  @xcite : gluon emission into the central region is exponentially suppressed as the rapidity distance from the quarks increases .",
    "it is exactly this difference between the qed and the qcd case which lets us expect the formation of rapidity gaps for color singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "single gluon exchange also produces a color singlet exchange piece which is defined by the @xmath43 term in eq .",
    "( [ summ2 ] ) . since its shape is identical to the one for tree level photon exchange ( dashed and dash - dotted lines in fig .  [ qedqcdtree](a ) ) , one might be misled to conclude that the color singlet contribution to single gluon exchange also produces rapidity gaps",
    ". however , there is an important difference between the two : the role of the amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 is interchanged in the qcd _ vs. _",
    "qed color singlet exchange amplitudes .",
    "the appearance of @xmath46 in the qed amplitude @xmath47 corresponds to the first two feynman graphs in fig .",

    "this is the final state @xmath27 , at @xmath49 it is the @xmath50 system .",
    "the situation is thus stable against gluon emission at even higher order for the qed case and gluon radiation is suppressed in the rapidity range between the two final state quarks .",
    "formally , the qcd amplitude @xmath51 also describes @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange as seen from the lower quark line .",
    "proportionality to @xmath45 implies that the gluon is emitted from the lower quark , @xmath28 , and hence preferentially between the initial @xmath28-beam and the final @xmath28 directions ( dash - dotted line in fig .  [ qedqcdtree](b ) ) .",
    "thus the color triplet @xmath50 system , into which the initial quark @xmath27 evolves , consists of a widely separated quark and gluon .",
    "higher order corrections will lead to strong gluon radiation into the angular region between the two and thus also into the rapidity range between the two final state quarks .",
    "one thus finds that a color singlet exchange structure as identified by the color tensors is not sufficient to infer the production of a rapidity gap in the gluon radiation pattern .",

    "soft gluon radiation in pomeron exchange therefore produces the pattern expected for @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange , and as argued earlier for photon exchange this pattern should be preserved for multiple soft gluon emission .",

    "qualitatively , the radiation pattern in pomeron exchange , @xmath105 , can be described as a superposition of a qed - like component , which dominates at small gluon transverse momenta , and a qcd - like component , which dominates in the hard region .",

    "( see fig .",
    "[ figseven](a ) the emission of soft gluons is severely suppressed compared to the tree level qcd case . in the forward region",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ figseven](b ) soft gluon emission in `` pomeron exchange '' essentially follows the shape expected for photon exchange . for large gluon transverse momenta",
    ", however , the qed - like component of @xmath105 is severely suppressed .",
    "the more qcd - like behavior at large @xmath106 may be understood by noting that the phase space integral for color singlet two - gluon exchange in eq .",
    "( [ m34tot ] ) is dominated by the region of small @xmath107 for one of the two gluons .",
    "a hard radiated gluon is insensitive to the color screening by this soft gluon and effectively only the color charge of the second , hard @xmath0-channel gluon is seen , leading to a more qcd - like radiation pattern .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed in figs .",
    "[ figsix ] and [ figseven ] by the curves for different values of the regularizing gluon mass .",
    "larger values of @xmath108 eliminate the soft gluon exchange region where the emitted gluon can resolve the color charges of the two @xmath0-channel gluons .",
    "thus the color singlet structure of @xmath0-channel two gluon exchange gains importance and the radiation pattern becomes more qed - like .",
    "[ figsix ] and [ figseven ] also exhibit the dependence of our results on the regularization of the gluon propagator . in the regions of strong destructive interference in @xmath65 , which are visible in fig .",
    "[ figsix ] , the quantitative results strongly depend on the details of soft gluon exchange and are thus non - perturbative in nature .",
    "the qualitative features , however , suppression of backwards soft gluon emission in color singlet two gluon exchange events and a more qcd - like behavior in the hard region , are insensitive to these uncertainties",
    ". in particular , the variation with @xmath108 is modest in the most important region , forward gluon emission at small @xmath106 .",
    "hence , our main finding , the qed like radiation pattern of soft gluons in pomeron exchange , is unaffected .",
    "we have analyzed the different properties of @xmath0-channel color singlet @xmath109 color octet exchange processes in @xmath55 scattering at next to leading order , namely including gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the radiation pattern of emitted gluons is intimately connected , after hadronization , to the angular distribution of produced hadrons and hence directly bears on the question whether rapidity gaps are to be expected in @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange processes .",
    "essentially , we arrive at an affirmative answer , also for the case of color singlet two gluon exchange .",
    "while this answer was expected by many in the field , our calculations reveal a rich internal structure of the pomeron .",
    "in addition , our demonstration had to deal with a number of problems which do not yet appear at the level of @xmath73 processes .",
    "while the definition of @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange is obvious in the case of @xmath56 scattering , the emission of an extra gluon complicates the picture .",
    "the color tensors of the @xmath14 process suggest identification of color singlet exchange as those terms where the color of at least one of the incident quarks remains unchanged . in the qcd case ( single gluon exchange )",
    "this also occurs since the color of the exchanged gluon can be compensated for by emission of a gluon of the same color .",
    "the crucial difference emerges when considering the angular distribution of emitted gluons : @xmath0-channel photon exchange leads to forward gluon emission and hence preserves the spatial distribution of the color charges which are present at lowest order .",
    "by contrast gluons are radiated in the backwards direction in the qcd color singlet term , and multiple emission will wash out the pattern produced by the first emitted gluon .",
    "color singlet and color octet exchange terms do not interfere because they are orthogonal in color . because of their different behaviour under multiple gluon emission any interference between a qed- and a qcd - like `` color singlet pattern '' will be severely suppressed at higher order .",
    "the square of the qed - like component in the color singlet exchange amplitude can hence be treated as the probability density for producing a hard scattering event which may evolve into a rapidity gap signature . for technical reasons ( numerical speed )",
    "we can not yet calculate rapidity gap cross sections , rather we are limited to an analysis at the amplitude square level when considering the @xmath0-channel exchange of two gluons .    for @xmath0-channel two gluon exchange",
    "we have calculated the imaginary part of the color singlet exchange amplitude , @xmath65 , and we have analyzed the emission probability for the extra gluon when the quarks are scattered by small angles only . at first sight gluon emission is most likely in the angular region between the two quarks . however , this pattern is solely due to @xmath11 splitting and subsequent @xmath87 scattering via the exchange of a low - nussinov pomeron . only after subtracting this contribution",
    "does the final pattern emerge for gluon emission in @xmath55 scattering via pomeron exchange .    for high transverse momentum of the emitted gluon ( of order of the quark momenta )",
    "the radiation pattern is quite similar to the one obtained for single gluon exchange .",
    "hard emitted gluons have too short a wavelength to see the screening of the color charge of the harder exchanged gluon by the second , typically very soft , exchanged gluon .",
    "the low - nussinov pomeron thus reveals itself as an extended object .",
    "hard gluon emission is able to resolve the internal color structure of the pomeron .    as the transverse momentum of the emitted gluon",
    "is decreased , a qualitative transition occurs .",
    "the gluon radiation can no longer resolve this internal color structure and hence the pomeron appears as a color singlet object . as a result the emission of a soft gluon ( @xmath110 ) follows a pattern very similar to the one observed for @xmath0-channel photon exchange .",
    "this pattern is expected to lead to the formation of rapidity gaps .",
    "since the overall gluon emission rate is dominated by the soft region , we conclude that two gluon color singlet exchange in dijet events may indeed lead to the formation of rapidity gap events as observed at the tevatron  @xcite .",
