    "it is becoming increasingly evident that the formation of super - massive black holes ( bh ) powering nuclear activity is intimately related to the formation of their host galaxies .",
    "observational evidence such as the presence of massive bh ( @xmath4 ) in at least all local galaxies with a spheroidal component ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) and tight correlations between the bh mass and the overall properties of the spheroids supports this connection ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; ferrarese 2002 ) . the evolution of nuclear activity ( agn ) with cosmic time is then a key ingredient in order to constrain the formation of galactic systems .",
    "investigations of radio - emitting agn can be of great help in tackling such issue since  as already proved by very early studies ( longair 1966 )  radio emission can be used as a clean tool , not affected by obscuration , to trace the agn evolution . on the other hand , the connection between the radio and optical activity still needs to be understood .",
    "one of the key studies on the evolution of both radio galaxies and radio quasars , was provided by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) . the radio luminosity function ( lf ) of these populations",
    "was separately obtained for steep spectrum and flat spectrum sources , by means of several samples selected at 2.7 ghz with relatively bright flux limits ( ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 jy ) .",
    "this analysis confirmed the presence of a so - called ` redshift cut - off' for the population of flat spectrum sources ( peacock 1985 ) , with a decline in comoving density of a factor @xmath5 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "most intriguingly , their work provided the first evidence for a similar behaviour for the population of steep spectrum sources , both quasars and radio galaxies , making this decline a common feature for all powerful radio objects .",
    "the evolution of both populations was found to be satisfactorily described by a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model , analogous to that found for optically selected quasars ( boyle et al .",
    "1988 ; boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; croom et al . 2004 ) , as well as by a luminosity / density evolution model , which incorporates a negative density evolution at high redshifts .    in order to investigate the possible presence of a redshift cut - off in the agn evolution ,",
    "several searches for high redshift radio  loud quasars have been carried out in the last years .",
    "shaver et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1999 ) argued for a drop in space density of flat spectrum quasars by more than a factor 10 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , a re - analysis of such sources ( jarvis & rawlings 2000 ; jarvis et al . 2001 ) suggests a more gradual ( factor @xmath10 ) decline in the same redshift interval .",
    "a luminosity dependent cut - off , with a space density decline less dramatic for the most luminous radio sources , has also been claimed by dunlop ( 1998 ) from a recent update of the work by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) .",
    "the question of a redshift cut - off in the quasar evolution has also been addressed at other wavelengths .",
    "no evidence for a rapid decline of the quasar space density has been found for soft x - ray selected samples at @xmath11 ( miyaji , hasinger & schmidt 2000 , ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) . on the other hand , optical data from the sloan survey ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) suggest the space density of @xmath12 quasars at @xmath13 to be more than one order of magnitude lower than that found at @xmath14 ( boyle et al .",
    "recently , by using a sample of 13 optically luminous radio quasars , vigotti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that their decline in the space density is about a factor of 2 between @xmath15 and @xmath13 , significantly smaller than the value @xmath16 found for samples including lower luminosity objects ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) .    however , the comparison with the behaviour of radio  selected sources hinges on the connection between the optical ( x  ray ) and radio activity .",
    "this is clearly of paramount relevance also with regards to the physical connection between the accretion processes and the jet formation .",
    "this aspect can be tackled from the comparison of the radio  loud and radio  quiet quasar populations .",
    "the behaviour of radio sources is also tightly connected within the framework of unification models ( e.g. padovani & urry 1992 , urry & padovani 1995 , jackson and wall 1999 ) .",
    "these rely on the fact that beaming effects and thus orientation play a key role in determining the observed properties of sources : bl lac objects and flat spectrum quasars would be the beamed version ",
    "i.e. viewed at an angle close to the jet axis  of fri and frii radio galaxies ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , respectively .",
    "the behaviour of radio quasars is thus closely related to that of the whole radio source population and in particular of powerful radio galaxies .    in the light of the above discussion",
    "the aim of the present paper is to estimate the low luminosity end of the lf of radio active quasars , by taking advantage of the new final releases of the 2df qso redshift and the first surveys .",
    "the aims are : i ) to explore the cosmological evolution of the selected sources , ii ) to examine the relation between the radio and optical activity and iii ) the connection between quasars and radio galaxies .",

    "we give a brief description of the new final releases of first and 2df quasar redshift survey datasets used for our analysis and the matching procedure used to cross - correlate the catalogues . in section 3",

    "the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ) survey ( becker et al . 1995 ) began in 1993 and its latest release ( april 2003 ) , used for this work , contains 811,117 sources observed at 1.4 ghz down to a flux limit @xmath23 mjy .",
    "the survey covers a total of about 9033 square degrees of sky ( 8422 square degrees in the north galactic cap and 611 in the south galactic cap ) and is substantially complete : it has been estimated to be 95 and 80 per cent complete at 2 mjy and 1 mjy , respectively ( becker et al .",

    "we briefly recall the main properties of the survey .",
    "qso candidates with optical magnitudes @xmath27 were selected from the apm catalogue ( irwin , mcmahon & maddox 1994 ) in two @xmath28 declination strips centered on @xmath29 ( south galactic cap ) and @xmath30 ( north galactic cap ) .",
    "the following color selection criteria have been applied : @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ( smith et al . 2003 ) , in order to guarantee a large photometric completeness ( @xmath34 per cent ) for quasars within the redshift range @xmath35 .",

    "all the optical - radio pairs having an offset less than 2 arcsec have been considered as true optical identifications . the value of 2 arcsec as matching radius was chosen after a careful analysis as the best compromise to maximize the number of real associations ( estimated to be @xmath41 per cent ) , and to minimize the contribution from spurious identifications down to a negligible 5 per cent ( magliocchetti & maddox 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to verify the reliability of the associations , all the radio - optical pairs obtained from the collapsing algorithm were checked by eye on the first image cutouts .",

    "we stress that due to the small statistics in this redshift range such result should only be taken as a rough estimate of the true incompleteness .",
    "therefore , under the `` strong '' assumption that the @xmath147 cut only affects the normalization of the rlf , independently of redshift , we can correct the rlf by a factor 2 in normalization , in order to have a rough estimate of the `` complete '' rlf of quasars down to @xmath148 .",

    "in the same redshift range ( @xmath151 ) we can achieve completeness down to @xmath152 ( see bottom panel of figure [ zpm ] ) .",
    "an analysis analogous to that applied for the rlf reveals that the cut at @xmath150 ( ) does not affect the shape of olf , as in the case of the rlf , but only its normalization by a factor @xmath153 .",

    "our results on the rlf can be meaningfully compared at its bright end with those obtained for bright radio selected quasars by willott et al .",

    "all their sources are found to be radio loud , due to the bright limits of these low frequency surveys , @xmath155 jy and @xmath156 jy , respectively .    before moving on ,",
    "a caveat is necessary .",
    "our dataset can not discriminate between steep and flat objects . as discussed in section [ radioindex ] , most of the sources in the first-2df sample are probably steep spectrum , as suggested by the lack of detection in the pmn .",
    "moreover , at low radio powers ( @xmath157 ) , the number of flat spectrum sources is much smaller than the steep spectrum ones even in samples selected at high frequencies ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ; maraschi & rovetti 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , this allows us to directly compare our data with the steep spectrum dataset of willott et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in order to perform this comparison ,",
    "we have converted source luminosities from the willott et al .",

    "the rlf for their best fit ( model c ) are shown in figure [ lfradio ] as thin long dashed lines .",
    "these appear to be in reasonably good agreement with our rlf ( corrected for renormalization , see section 3.3 ) .",

    "our best fit value for the slope is @xmath158 , fully consistent with @xmath159 quoted by willott et al .",
    "the second important aspect is related to the flattening of the rlf at the faint end . due to the paucity of data , willott et al . estimated the value of the break luminosity by fixing a slope @xmath160 for the faint end and fitting the radio number counts at @xmath161 jy .",
    "this procedure led to a value of the break luminosity @xmath162 ( ) , i.e. @xmath163 when translated at 1.4 ghz . with our sample  which is more than 100 times fainter than the 7c",
    " we can directly determine for the first time this flattening and our analysis confirms that the faint end is well described by @xmath164 .",

    "( 1998 ) , by considering both a luminosity and a density evolution model .",
    "the evolution of the rlf found in our sample is also consistent with that derived for brighter sources , showing a maximum at @xmath166 .",
    "however , the first-2df sample shows indications for negative evolution beyond @xmath167 ( see section [ like ] ) , while the brighter willott et al .",
    "sample is consistent with no evolution up to the highest redshifts probed by their surveys ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "however , their statistics in the @xmath169 range is rather limited ( @xmath170 sources ) .    in order to assess the significance of our finding of a negative evolution beyond @xmath167 , we considered the behaviour of the quasar number density @xmath171 as a function of redshift .",
    "this is obtained by integrating the lfs over the luminosity range detectable up to the highest redshift in our data .",
    "it is worth noting that , even though we do not have information on the bright end of the rlf , our sample extends up to the break of the lf , thus accounting for the bulk of the sources .",
    "the number density @xmath171 is plotted in figure [ density ] , where the error bars indicate poissonian uncertainties .",
    "we find that the space density of first-2df quasars shows a significant ( @xmath1 ) tendency for a decrement at @xmath172 .",
    "such a decrement is found to be approximately a factor 2 at @xmath173 .",
    "these results hold in both cosmologies . in the small panel of figure [ density ]",
    "we also show the space density computed for two bins of radio power .",
    "the decline observed for the whole sample is still evident for low - luminosity objects as well as for brighter ones .",
    "for the latter sources the decline seems to be less pronounced , but the small statistics does not allow to draw any conclusion .",
    "we note that our choice of adopting a single spectral index ( @xmath174 ) for all the sources undetected by pmn could introduce some uncertainties in the determination of @xmath171 .",
    "in fact , radio spectra steepen at higher frequencies and , as shown by jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) , this is crucial in determining the space density of radio objects at high redshift .",
    "in order to quantify this uncertainty we have then considered an `` extreme case '' by assuming for all the sources with @xmath175 a steep spectral index ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "clearly this results in larger radio powers and in turn in a rise in the bright end of the lf , to the detriment at fainter luminosities .",
    "the crucial point is to assess the completeness of the sample .",
    "in fact , due to the steeper spectral index at high z , the observed fluxes would drop more rapidly with redshift .",
    "however , even by assuming such a steep spectral index ( @xmath177 ) for @xmath175 , the 2 mjy limit of our sample ensures completeness down to @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",
    "this , together with the fact that the trend for the space density of fainter and brighter sources is found to be similar ( see figure 4 ) , makes us confident that our results , and particularly those on the space density of radio - loud quasars , are not severely affected by the uncertainty associated to an unknown spectral index .",
    "another source of uncertainty could arise from the double selection , radio and optical , of the sample since radio and optical luminosities are related , even though with a large scatter ( cirasuolo et al .",
    "therefore , low luminosity radio sources would be affected by the optical flux limit more quickly than the brighter ones .",
    "this selection effect would be effective at all redshifts , but stronger at high z due to the redshift dependence of the limiting luminosity ( see figure [ zpm ] ) , producing a fake decline in the space density .",
    "however , the large scatter between radio and optical luminosities  at least three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity at a fixed optical one ( cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003a )  completely dominates over this selection effect .",
    "this is again supported by the similar decline in space density at high redshift of sources with different radio powers ( see figure [ density ] ) .",
    "the last point worth stressing is that we find no evidence for a strong decrement in the space density at low redshifts .",
    "in fact , @xmath171 is found to decrease by only a factor @xmath153 between @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "this lack of a significant evolution at low redshifts has also been recently claimed by clewley & jarvis ( 2004 ) for fainter sources ( @xmath182 ) at @xmath183 , even though the evolution of the very low luminosity population ( i.e. fr  i ) still remains unconstrained ( magliocchetti , celotti & danese 2002 ) .",
    "clearly the best reference for the olf of the radio quasar sample is constituted by the olf of the ` parent ' ( 2df qso redshift survey ) population ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in figure [ lfopt ]",
    "we report the best fit solutions for the olf found by croom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( dashed lines , corresponding to the polynomial evolution model in the case of cosmology i ) . as in the case of the rlf",
    ", we applied a correction of a factor @xmath184 in the normalization of our olf to account for incompleteness effects ( see section [ incompl ] ) .",
    "this provides an estimate of the olf ( dot - dashed lines ) representative of the whole population of radio - active quasars with @xmath152 ( ) .",
    "as expected , the olf of radio detected quasars is flatter than the one derived for the population as a whole .",
    "this is already visible at the brighter end where the slope of the first-2df olf is @xmath185 ( depending on the adopted model ) , while that obtained by croom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is @xmath186 .",
    "this trend becomes increasingly more significant towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "indeed , this is consistent with the observed dependence of the fraction of radio detected quasars as a function of optical luminosity ( padovani 1993 ; la franca et al .",
    "1994 ; hooper et al . 1995 ; c03 ) .",
    "however , cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2003b ) showed that this can simply be the result of selection effects due to the radio and optical limits of the various samples , under the assumption that the optical and radio luminosities are linearly ( even though ) broadly correlated . in this case",
    "the intrinsic shape of the distribution of the radio - to - optical ratio @xmath187 for the quasar population as a whole is found to show a broad peak at @xmath188 containing more than 90 per cent of the sources , followed by a steep transition region at @xmath189 ( see fig . 4 in cirasuolo et al .",
    "this implies that , at a given radio flux limit , surveys with brighter optical limiting magnitudes preferentially select smaller values of @xmath187 ",
    "i.e. closer to the peak of the distribution  which results in a higher percentage of radio detections .    in figure",
    "[ lfopt ] we also compare our results with previous determinations of the olf for bright ( @xmath190 ) radio - loud quasars ( la franca et al .",
    "1994 ; their best - fit function ( model b ) is indicated with long - dashed lines ) .",
    "an overall good agreement between the two olfs is found in the magnitude range in which the two samples overlap .",
    "the olf obtained from our sample peaks at @xmath191 and  as in the case of the rlf ",
    "possibly hints to a decline at higher redshifts . on the contrary , la franca et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find a maximum redshift for luminosity evolution @xmath192 , beyond which no further evolution is detected . the same substantial lack of evolution in the range @xmath193 has also been claimed by goldschmidt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . however , we argue that the limited sizes of their @xmath15 samples do not allow for any strong statistical conclusion .",
    "let us finally consider the relation between the radio quasar and the entire radio source population .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ lfradio ] represent the rlf for steep plus flat spectrum radio sources obtained by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) ( calculated at 1.4 ghz by assuming a radio spectral index @xmath66 for steep spectrum sources ) .",
    "it is clear that the fraction of radio quasars decreases toward lower powers , implying that for @xmath157 ( ) the fraction of radio galaxies is dominant with respect to radio quasars , while at higher luminosities the two populations are of comparable importance .",
    "the shaded area in figure [ torus ] shows the ratio @xmath194 between the rlf of radio quasars  drawn from the first-2df sample and corrected in normalization  and the rlf of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) as a function of radio luminosity .",
    "the increasingly larger scatter for @xmath195 ( ) is due to the different evolution in redshift of the two rlfs .",
    "as already discussed , the space density of radio active quasars is found to decline at high redshift , while the radio population as a whole still shows a positive evolution , therefore increasing the scatter in @xmath194 .",
    "a similar trend in the fraction of quasars as a function of luminosity has been found by willott et al .",
    "( 2000 ) by analyzing radio selected samples .",
    "they found that this fraction is @xmath196 per cent at bright ( narrow [ oii ] ) emission line luminosities ( @xmath197}$ ] )  assumed to be good tracer of the ionizing continuum  dropping to a few per cent for fainter luminosities .",
    "they suggested that this finding can be accounted for by either a gradual decrease of the opening angle of the obscuring ` torus ' with decreasing ionizing luminosity or with the emergence of a distinct population of low luminosity radio sources , m87like .    following the approach suggested by willott et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we try to interpret the decrease of @xmath194 within the ` receding torus ' scenario . in this model ,",
    "initially proposed by lawrence ( 1991 ; see also simpson 1998 ) , the inner radius of the torus depends on the agn radiation field which sublimates the dust grains .",
    "if the scale - height of the torus is independent of the ionizing luminosity @xmath198 , its inner radius scales as @xmath199 resulting in larger half - opening angles @xmath200 at higher luminosities .",
    "the fraction of quasars predicted is then : @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 are a normalization luminosity and the corresponding torus half - opening angle , fixed by the measured quasar fraction at that luminosity . as we can not rely on the @xmath197}$ ] as willott et al .",
    ", as a working hypothesis we use the radio luminosity as a tracer of the central ionizing radiation field .",
    "this is based on the linear relation between radio power at 151 mhz and @xmath197}$ ] suggested by willott ( 2000 ) , @xmath197 } \\propto l_{151}^{1.0}$ ] , although with a large scatter ( see also willott et al .",
    "1999 ) . because of this uncertainty , we modified eq .",
    "[ eqwill ] assuming that the ionizing luminosity scales as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the radio power at 1.4 ghz and @xmath206 is a free parameter , i.e. : @xmath207 different values for the parameter @xmath206 have been tested in order to reproduce the measured fraction of radio active quasars .",
    "as shown in figure [ torus ] , a nearly linear dependence of the central ionizing luminosity on the radio power ( @xmath208 ) is able to reproduce the observed fraction , @xmath209 is only marginally consistent with it , while the extreme value @xmath210 is totally inconsistent with the observed behaviour .",
    "this finding is a posteriori broadly consistent with the relation @xmath197}$ ] vs @xmath211 found by willott ( 2000 ) and with the evidence found by cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2003b ) for a nearly linear dependence of the radio luminosity on the optical one .",
    "however , the linear relation used in eq . ( [ eqtorus ] ) does not take into account the large scatter between radio and optical / uv luminosities , which could mask the effect postulated by the receding torus model . an observational way to test",
    "whether indeed @xmath212% of weak radio sources contain a hidden quasar  as implied by such model  would be the measure of the level of their nuclear ( disc / torus ) activity through far - ir photometry ( i.e. with spitzer ) .",
    "the comparison between the radio quasar and the whole radio source population within the framework of the unification scenario  postulating that radio - loud quasars represent the beamed counterparts of powerful ( fr  ii ) radio sources",
    " reveals a further aspect worth mentioning .",
    "willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed a dual population model for the rlf by separating the contribution from the high and low luminosity sources assumed to have a differential density evolution .",
    "the latter population can be associated with weak / low ionization emission lines radio galaxies  both fr  i and fr  ii  while the high luminosity population can be representative of radio galaxies and quasars with strong / high ionization emission lines and fr  ii radio properties . a comparison of our rlf with that of the high power population identified by willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( converted to 1.4 ghz by assuming @xmath66 ; thick long - dashed lines in figure [ lfradio ] ) shows that at @xmath213 ( w hz@xmath214 sr@xmath214 ) the observed quasar number density largely exceeds that of the whole population at 1.4 ghz ) . ] as derived by willott et al .",
    "it is worth reminding here that all of the sources in the first-2df sample are classified as quasars , based on both their broad emission lines and bright luminosity ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "furthermore , they are radio loud according both to their radio luminosity ( @xmath152 ; miller et al .",
    "1990 ) and radio - to - optical ratio ( @xmath215 ; kellermann et al .",
    "however , for the first time , the first-2df sample is able to explore the low optical and radio luminosity ranges . in particular , the radio powers sampled with this work approach the transition region between frii and fri sources , posing the problem of the nature of these low luminosity objects .",
    "a few possibilities are open .",
    "they could hint at a population of quasars with intermediate frii - fri radio properties , either intrinsic or due to an evolution between these two radio phases ( such as those discussed by blundell & rawlings 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , these objects might be bordering the intermediate radio quasar population ( i.e. between loud and quiet radio quasars with no evidence for relativistic jets ) .",
    "finally , they might simply represent a lower luminosity version of powerful radio quasars , which thus do not obviously fit into the ` classical ' scheme for radio sources .",
    "this might correspond to the fading phase of luminous quasars .",
    "interesting clues on this issue would come from the study of their radio morphology .",
    "the novelty of our work is that , by exploiting the faint observational limits of both radio and optical surveys such as the first and the 2df quasar redshift survey , it was possible for the first time to explore the faint end of the lfs of radio ( loud ) quasars at both wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , the larger number of radio - detected quasars collected by using these datasets allowed for a suitable determination of these lfs up to @xmath216 .",
    "the most intriguing result we found is the indication ( @xmath217 )  both in radio and optical band  of a negative evolution for these faint sources at @xmath218 .",
    "this corresponds to a decrement in the space density of faint quasars of about a factor 2 at @xmath219 2.2 . for brighter",
    " either radio or optically selected ",
    "samples , the evolution of radio  loud quasars shows a peak at @xmath220 , but no evidence for a decline at higher redshifts ( willott et al .",
    "1998 ; la franca et al . 1994 ; goldschmidt et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this result is thus consistent with the presence of a differential evolution for the population of radio - active quasars ( vigotti et al .",
    "2003 ) , where the weakest radio sources show a more pronounced decline in space density than the more powerful ones , suggesting the evolution to be a function of the intrinsic power ( as in the luminosity / density evolution model of dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",
    "the second interesting finding is the flattening of the faint end of the lfs of radio active quasars in both the radio and optical bands .",
    "the found behaviour of the olf at faint magnitudes is consistent with previous estimates performed at brighter magnitudes ( la franca et al . 1994 ; goldschmidt et al . 1999 ) , and the comparison with the olf of the quasar population as a whole supports a dependence of the fraction of radio detected quasars on their optical luminosity .",
    "this flattening can simply result from a linear although broad intrinsic correlation between the radio and optical luminosities when combined with the radio and optical limits of the various surveys ( cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "finally , we find that a progressive decrement in the fraction of quasars in the whole radio source population can be consistently accounted for within the ` receding torus ' scenario by assuming a quasi - linear dependence between optical and radio luminosities . at this stage",
    ", the nature of the lower radio luminosity sources in our sample appears unclear substantially due to the lack of information on the origin / characteristics of their radio emission , which could be unveiled by higher resolution radio imaging .",
