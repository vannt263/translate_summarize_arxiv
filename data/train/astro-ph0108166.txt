    "because of its proximity ( 13.2 mpc for @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 pc ) , the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ( osterbrock & koski 1976 ) ngc  4151 is one of the best studied among the class . x - ray observations show that ngc  4151 is a modest luminosity ( @xmath14 ) active galactic nucleus ( agn ) with a highly variable and hard continuum .",
    "there is evidence for a spectral - flux correlation above 2 kev ( perola  1986 ; yaqoob & warwick 1991 ; yaqoob  1993 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray continuum of ngc  4151 is characterized by a prominent excess of x - ray emission above an extrapolation of the absorbed , higher energy power - law component to lower energies .",
    "this `` soft excess '' has been described in terms of partial covering , a warm absorber , scattered nuclear radiation and additional spectral components ( e.g. holt  1980 ; yaqoob & warwick 1991 ; weaver  1994a , b ) .    _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ observations identified extended soft x - ray emission that appears to be associated with ionized gas visible optically ( elvis , briel & henry 1983 ; morse 1995 ) .",
    "this extended emission must account for at least part of the `` soft excess '' .",
    "ogle  ( 2000 ) have recently obtained a 48 ks observation of ngc  4151 with the high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. their observation provided the first high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of ngc  4151 and also a zero - order image .",
    "strong , narrow x - ray emission lines are seen in the spectrum .",
    "evidence of both photoionized and collisionally ionized gas was found . however , their zero - order image has only modest signal - to - noise due to the limited transmission of the gratings .",
    "we thought it worthwhile to obtain an exposure without the gratings in place in order to obtain a sensitive image of the extended emission .",
    "given the dependence of the hetgs zero - order transmission on energy , our @xmath15 ks direct image has higher sensitivity than the zero - order image by ogle ( 2000 ) for all energies below @xmath16 kev .    in this paper , we present a _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observation of ngc  4151 .",
    "observations are described in section 2 .",
    "data analysis and results are presented in section 3 , where we present the best x - ray image of ngc  4151 to date and low resolution spectra of both the nucleus and extended regions .",
    "the x - ray image is also compared with optical and radio images .",
    "implications of the observation are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the detection of an off nuclear source about 22 sw of the nucleus of ngc  4151 is described in the appendix .",
    "the observations of ngc  4151 were obtained in two phases .",
    "first , to evaluate the effects of pile up in the bright inner regions of ngc  4151 , we took a preliminary 4.3  ks observation on dec .",
    "4 1999 in so called `` alternating mode '' , in which single exposures with a 0.1  s frame time were alternated with two exposures with a 0.4  s frame time .",
    "the observation showed that the nucleus is significantly piled up in the 0.4  s , but not in the 0.1  s , frame time observations .",
    "we also inferred that the bright inner regions of the galaxy would be strongly affected by pile up in the planned long exposure , which would use the standard 3.2  s frame time .",
    "we thus decided to obtain another , longer observation in `` alternating mode '' , in addition to the long observation , to mitigate the effect of pile up in the inner regions .",
    "therefore , the second phase of observations consisted of a @xmath10 26  ks observation with 3.2  s frame time and a @xmath10 7  ks observation in `` alternating mode '' , including both 0.1  s and 0.4  s exposures .",
    "observations are summarized in table  1 . in the @xmath17 ks observation , ccds i2 ,",
    "i3 , s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 were read out , though all of the detected x - ray emission from ngc 4151 is on s3 . in both `` alternating mode '' exposures ,",
    "only chip s3 was read out .    the fraction of bad grades ( i.e. the ratio of the number of counts with asca grades 1 + 5 + 7 [ defined in the _ the chandra proposers observatory guide _ ,",
    "section 6.3 ] to the total number of counts ) was found to be a good indicator of the degree of pile up in any given pixel through comparison with the event rates in the different frame time observations .",
    "regions with a large fraction ( nominal value @xmath18 ) of bad grades were considered to be piled - up . as already found in the preliminary observation , the 0.1  s frame time data were not piled - up , with less than 6% of the grades in the brightest pixel being bad .",
    "the 0.4  s and 3.2  s frame time data were found to suffer from pile - up out to 13 and @xmath19 from the nucleus , respectively .",
    "all of the analysis was initially done with the `` old '' response functions ( `` fefs '' ) , and data were reduced and analysed with ciao v1.1.5 and xspec v11.0.1 .",
    "the observations were screened for high background count rates and aspect errors by following the _ chandra science threads_. after we received the referee s report , new versions of response function ( caldb 2.7 ) were available .",
    "we reanalysed some of the data with these new response functions and with the latest version of ciao  v2.1.2 . in general , the change in derived parameters ( such as absorbing column , photon index , bremsstrahlung temperature and emission line properties ) were small .",
    "we did not reanalyse the 0.1  s frame time nuclear observations with the new response functions because our results agree well with the concurrent hetgs observations of the nucleus by ogle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which have much higher spectral resolution and are thus superior for detection of lines .",
    "we have , however , added 0.2 kev to the line energies below 1 kev from the 0.1  s frame time observation since there is a systematic error of this magnitude when using the old response functions .",
    "the results presented for the 0.4s frame time nuclear observations and the 3.2s frame time observations of the extended emission employed the new response functions .",
    "the soft x - ray ( 0.32.5 kev ) images derived from the 0.1  s , 0.4  s and 3.2  s frame time exposures are shown in fig .",
    "the `` hole '' at the position of the nucleus in the 3.2  s frame time image ( fig .",
    "1c ) is due to pile - up .",
    "the x - ray emission of ngc 4151 comprises a bright unresolved nucleus and resolved extended regions . the south - west part of the extended emission extends as far as @xmath20 ( @xmath21 pc ) from the nucleus along pa @xmath22 .",
    "the north - east part of the extended emission extends to @xmath23 ( @xmath24 pc ) from the nucleus along pa @xmath25 .",
    "the structure of the extended emission appears to be knotty rather than smooth . a moderately bright , compact knot is clearly visible @xmath26 ( @xmath27 pc ) south - west of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "1c ) . a contour map representation of the extended emission is shown in fig .",
    "2 . our images are in good agreement with the hetgs zero - order image obtained by ogle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but are more sensitive",
    ".    the 29 kev emission is not resolved in our observations , as can be seen by comparing the radial profile of the observations in this band with the point spread function ( psf ) . in fig .",
    "3a , the 5.5 kev model psf without aspect error is plotted with the observed profiles of the 29 kev emission .",
    "the 0.42 kev emission is , on the other hand , resolved along the northeast - southwest direction , but is not ( or is marginally ) resolved along the northwest - southeast direction ( figs .",
    "3b , c , d ) .",
    "we extracted spectra of the nucleus from a circular region with radius @xmath19 in the 0.1  s and 0.4  s frame time observations .",
    "the total number of counts in the spectra are 2033 and 10690 in the 0.1  s and 0.4  s frame times , respectively . for both observations ,",
    "the background was taken from a region between two ellipses centered on the nucleus .",
    "the large ellipse had a semi - major axis of 175 along pa @xmath28 ( the column direction of ccd read out ) and the smaller ellipse had a semi - major axis of 125 in the direction of pa @xmath29 .",
    "this rather oddly - shaped background region allowed all the background events to be extracted from the same ccd node .",
    "the extracted spectra were grouped to a minimum of 20 and 30 counts per bin in the 0.1  s and 0.4  s frame time data , respectively , to allow use of @xmath30 statistics .",
    "the spectral resolution of acis - s is @xmath31 kev at 1 kev . for the bright nuclear region ,",
    "the spectral resolution was not significantly degraded by this grouping .",
    "because of the poor calibration at low energies and high background at high energies , channels below 0.3 kev and above 9 kev were ignored when modeling the spectra .",
    "the emission from the brightest part of ngc 4151 originates in the nucleus and the unresolved emission line regions .",
    "at least two components are needed to describe the continuum of the spectra from this region : a hard power law absorbed by an equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath32 and a soft component that can be represented by either an absorbed power law or a thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the 0.1  s frame time spectra were fitted with these two component continuum models ( table 2 ) plus emission lines ( table 3 ) .",
    "the model 29 kev flux is @xmath33 and the photon index of the hard component @xmath34 . the soft x - ray spectrum below 2 kev can be described as a power law with photon index @xmath35 ( table 2 , fig .",
    "an alternative description in terms of thermal bremsstrahlung gives a temperature @xmath36 kev ( fig 4b ) .",
    "however , the emission can not be described by solar abundance , collisionally ionized hot gas .",
    "the best fit double power law parameters agree with those obtained in a concurrent hetgs observation ( ogle  2000 ) .",
    "previous asca observations ( weaver  1994b ) gave a 210 kev flux of @xmath37 , a photon index of @xmath38 and an absorbing column of @xmath39 .",
    "weaver et al.s absorbing column is about the same as found in our observation and that of ogle ( 2000 ) , while the photon index and flux from asca are significantly larger , indicating variability of the hard component .",
    "our observations suggest that the hard component of ngc  4151 is at its lowest state since 1984 ( _ exosat _ observations yielded a low 210 kev flux of @xmath40 , [ pounds et al .",
    "the very hard power law index found in the present observations with _",
    "chandra _ is unusual for a seyfert 1 galaxy ( mushotzky 1984 ) .",
    "lines were identified by adding narrow gaussian features to the continuum model with the goal of reducing the @xmath41 value of the fit .",
    "for all cases except the combined o vii triplet , the intrinsic line width was set to zero . both 0.1  s and 0.4  s frame time data were used .",
    "though piled - up , the continuum of the 0.4  s frame time data between 0.4 to 7 kev can still be described by a double power law model reasonably well ( reduced @xmath42 for 179 degrees of freedom ) , with a rather hard photon index ( @xmath43 ) above 2 kev ( fig .",
    "this value of @xmath44 is , however , too low as a result of the pile up .",
    "the low spectral resolution of the acis instrument does not allow us to resolve all the lines seen in the grating observation ( ogle 2000 ) , but the stronger lines are detected .",
    "the best fits to the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "4 , while the lines identified are listed in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the errors represent the 90% confidence range for a single interesting parameter .",
    "one feature in the 0.4  s frame time spectrum , which probably results from the rapid change of effective area with energy near 2 kev , is also listed in table 4 and labeled as `` artefact '' .",
    "the line fluxes from the 0.1  s frame time image agree well with those found in the hetgs observation ( table 3 ) .",
    "the line fluxes found from the 0.4  s frame time data tend to be lower than those obtained from the grating observation ( see table 4 ) , probably as a result of pile up .      for the extended emission , we used the 3.2 s frame - time observation and extracted spectra from non - piled - up regions more than @xmath19 from the nucleus to both ne and sw .",
    "the spectrum of the ne region was extracted from a 127 @xmath45 86 rectangle centered 73 northeast of the nucleus ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) with the longer side in position angle @xmath48 .",
    "the spectrum of the sw region was extracted from a 123@xmath4577 rectangle centered 92 southwest of the nucleus ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) with the longer side in position angle @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "the total number of counts in the ne and sw regions are 1120 and 1776 , respectively .",
    "the background region was the same as in section 3.2 .",
    "the data were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin in each region .",
    "the spectral resolution above 1 kev was significantly reduced by this grouping , especially for the ne region .",
    "as before , channels below 0.3 and above 9 kev were ignored in spectral modelling .    the extended soft x - ray continuum emission can be modeled by a single bremsstrahlung or power law model with photo - electric absorption ( table 5 ) .",
    "the emission observed above 2 kev is the unresolved nuclear emission which has been spread out by the mirror psf ( see section 3.1 and fig .",
    "3a ) , and are hence modeled with an absorbed power law with photon index and absorbing column density identical to the nuclear value ( section 3.2 ) . the absorbing column densities for the extended regions are not well constrained with the present data and were `` frozen '' to the galactic value ( n@xmath52 , murphy  1996 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the spectral index as a function of distance from the nucleus .",
    "however , the low count rate in the extended region makes it hard to obtain such spectra . to obtain a more qualitative picture , the `` hardness ratio '' of the soft x - ray band ( defined as",
    "the ratio of background subtracted count rates in the 0.82.0 kev and 0.40.8 kev bands ) as a function of distance from the nucleus has been obtained for the sw region from the 3.2 s frame time observation ( fig .",
    "no significant change of hardness ratio is seen between @xmath53 and @xmath20 from the nucleus .",
    "spectral lines were identified with the same technique as for the nucleus , and the results are shown in table 6 .",
    "he - like o and ne triplets are seen in both the sw and ne regions .",
    "the 0.720.74 kev feature observed in both regions could be a blend of lines of h - like o and radiative recombination continuum features of o vii .",
    "the observed spectra are compared with the continuum plus emission - line models in fig .",
    "an [ o iii]@xmath9 contour map ( prez - fournon & wilson 1990 ) is overlaid on the 3.2  s frame time 0.39 kev image in fig 8 . extended x - ray emission is well correlated with the forbidden line emission to both ne and sw of the nucleus .",
    "the x - ray knot @xmath26 ( @xmath27 pc ) to the sw of nucleus is also seen in the [ o iii ] image , but with a @xmath54 displacement .",
    "in fig . 9 , a radio contour map from merlin observations ( mundell  1995 ) is overlaid on our 0.1  s frame time _",
    "chandra _ image .",
    "the radio jet does not align with the soft x - ray extension .",
    "the angle between the two directions is @xmath55 .",
    "one of the early suggestions for the origin of `` soft excess '' is the partial covering model ( holt  1980 ) , in which the continuum from the nucleus is covered by a `` clumpy '' absorber .",
    "previous studies show that a covering factor of 0.7 to 0.97 can account for all or a significant part of the `` soft excess '' ( e.g. weaver et al . 1994b , warwick et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , in the two concurrent observations presented by ogle  ( 2000 ) and this paper , the photon indices for the hard and soft component were found to be @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the 0.12 kev flux from our observation is @xmath58 , which is close to the lowest value seen in the _ asca _ observations of @xmath59 ( weaver et al .",
    "this shows no significant variability in the soft component , in contrast to the large variability in the hard component .",
    "these results makes a partial covering model unlikely .",
    "the same argument applies to the notion that the soft emission is thomson scattered nuclear radiation , as already noted by ogle ( 2000 ) . instead",
    ", it is most likely that the soft and hard components are intrinsically different x - ray sources .    the thomson scattering model for the extended soft emission",
    "can be evaluated using the soft- and hard - band profiles ( fig .",
    "the hard - band profile is consistent with the mirror psf , indicating there is no detectable intrinsically extended hard emission .",
    "this allows an upper limit to the fractional brightness of any hard nuclear emission which is thomson scattered by the extended gas to be obtained .",
    "because thomson scattering is wavelength independent , this upper limit can be compared with the brightness of the extended , soft emission , expressed as a fraction of the soft nuclear emission . using the 0.1  s frame time observations in fig .",
    "3a , the 29 kev brightness within @xmath60 of the nucleus is 0.12   and the intrinsic 29 kev brightness between @xmath53 and @xmath61 from the nucleus is @xmath62 , which represent an upper limit to the thomson scattered hard radiation .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the 0.42 kev emission are 0.13  for the nucleus and @xmath63  between @xmath53 and @xmath61 from the nucleus in the sw region ( fig .",
    "3c ) . defining @xmath64(brightness between @xmath53 to @xmath61 from the nucleus)/(brightness within @xmath60 of the nucleus ) , we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the argument indicates that the extended soft emission is not thomson scattered nuclear radiation as long as the intensity of the nuclear radiation radiated towards the putative scattering region is equal to that radiated towards earth",
    ". the nuclear 29 kev radiation radiated towards the extended region may be stronger than that radiated in our direction because the latter is absorbed .",
    "such an effect decreases @xmath67 and increases the discrepancy between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "if the soft nuclear emission is absorbed by more than the low column we obtained by fitting the spectrum , it is possible that more soft radiation is radiated from the nucleus towards the extended emission than towards us .",
    "this effect would reduce @xmath69 and could potentially remove the discrepancy between @xmath69 and @xmath67 .",
    "while such can not be ruled out , we consider it unlikely that the extended x - ray emission is thomson - scattered nuclear radiation .",
    "the close association between the extended soft x - ray emission and the optical line emission in ngc 4151 suggests that the x - rays may arise from hot gas in pressure equilibrium with the extended narrow line region ( enlr ) ( heckman & balick 1983 , morse  1995 ) .",
    "gas of @xmath70 k is needed to confine the cooler gas clouds ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 , hereafter kmt ; krolik & vrtilek 1984 ) .",
    "grating observations with the _ chandra _ hetgs show clear signatures of both photoionization and collisional ionization in the x - ray emitting gas in the narrow line region .",
    "this indicates at least two phases exist in the plasma , one being hot ( @xmath71 k ) and collisionally ionized and the other warm ( @xmath72 k ) and photoionized ( ogle 2000 ) .",
    "penston  ( 1990 ) derived emissivity - weighted estimates for the electron density and electron temperature in the sw optical enlr of @xmath73 and @xmath74 k , corresponding to a pressure of @xmath75 k. if the warm and hot clouds are in a rough pressure equilibrium , the density of the hot phase gas at a temperature of @xmath76 k ( the bremsstrahlung temperature in the sw regions ) should be @xmath77 . assuming the hot gas in the observed sw region uniformly fills a cylinder with a radius of 246 pc ( @xmath10 385 ) and a height of 787 pc ( @xmath10 123 ) , the number density inferred from the bremsstrahlung description of the continuum of the sw radiation ( see table 5 ) is found to be @xmath78 .",
    "this is close to that needed for pressure balance .",
    "using the two power - law spectrum obtained from the 0.1  s frame time observation ( section 3.2 ) and adopting a spectral turn - over near 100 kev ( maisack  1993 ) , we obtain a photoionizing luminosity @xmath79 .",
    "the ionization parameter ( defined as @xmath80 , kmt ) for the hot gas measured at the center of the sw region ( @xmath81 pc ) is then 0.19 .",
    "this combination of temperature and ionization parameter lies in the general area of the equilibrium curves of @xmath82 versus @xmath83 calculated by kmt , although the equilibrium would be unstable .",
    "we note that the temperature derived from the bremsstrahlung model is much lower than the compton temperature ( @xmath84 k , see kmt ) .",
    "given our low spectral resolution , we can not tell whether the emission lines we see from the extended region are collisionally ionized or photoionized .",
    "ogle  ( 2000 ) identified photoionized n vii , o vii , o viii , ne ix and ne x in the nuclear region from the narrowness of their radiative recombination continua .",
    "we see lines ( some tentatively ) of o vii , oviii , ne ix and ne x from the extended regions ( table 6 ) .",
    "if these species are created by photoionization , the ionizing parameter lies in the range @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) .",
    "using the ionization luminosity given above , and a typical radius of 500 pc , these values of @xmath87 imply @xmath88 .",
    "the temperature of this gas would be @xmath89 k according to kallman & mccray ( 1982 ) .",
    "higher spectral resolution observations are needed to determine whether these lines are photoionized in such a warm gas or collisionally ionized in a hotter one .",
    "we have obtained high sensitivity x - ray imaging - spectroscopy of ngc  4151 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ . the soft x - ray emission ( below 2 kev ) is spatially resolved and extends as far as @xmath90 pc to the sw and @xmath91 pc to the ne of the nucleus .",
    "there is a close correlation between the extended soft x - ray and [ o iii]@xmath9 emissions on the hundreds of pc scale .",
    "the 0.49 kev spectra of the nucleus and the extended regions to the sw and ne of the nucleus have been obtained .",
    "the x - ray emission above 2 kev is spatially unresolved and is well described by an absorbed power law .",
    "the spectrum above 2 kev is harder and the flux lower than in observations made with asca in 1993 ( weaver 1994b ) .",
    "the spectrum below 2 kev , on the other hand , is softer than found previously .",
    "the large difference between the soft and hard spectral shapes does not favor the partial covering or scattering model of the `` soft excess '' .",
    "instead , it is likely that the hard and soft nuclear components represent intrinsically different x - ray sources .",
    "we have shown that a model in which the extended emission is electron - scattered nuclear radiation is extremely implausible .",
    "with the temperature ( @xmath92 k ) inferred from a bremsstrahlung interpretation of the x - ray spectrum , this hot gas is close to pressure equilibrium with the gas which radiates the optical line emission . while the extended emission is certainly thermal , our observations do not permit a clear distinction between a photoionized and collisionally ionized gas .",
    "it is likely that both components are present , given the findings of ogle  ( 2000 ) for the nuclear region .",
    "we thank andy j. young , patrick l. shopbell and david a. smith for help with using ciao , xspec and wip in analyzing the data .",
    "we are also grateful to carole g. mundell for providing the merlin map in the numerical form .",
    "this research was partially supported by nasa grant nag 81027 , by hst grant go 7275 , and by the graduate school of the university of maryland .",
    "an unresolved x - ray source ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) @xmath1022 sw of the nucleus ( p.a .",
