    "the kerr family , discovered in 1963  @xcite , comprises perhaps the most important family of exact solutions to the einstein vacuum equations @xmath18 the governing equations of general relativity . for parameter values @xmath19 (",
    "here @xmath1 denotes the mass and @xmath0 angular momentum per unit mass ) , the kerr solutions represent black hole spacetimes : i.e.  asymptotically flat spacetimes which possess a region which can not communicate with future null infinity .",
    "the celebrated schwarzschild family sits as the one - parameter subfamily of kerr corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "much of current theoretical astrophysics is based on the hypothesis that isolated systems described by kerr metrics are ubiquitous in the observable universe .    despite the centrality of the kerr family to the general relativistic world picture ,",
    "the most basic questions about the behaviour of linear waves on kerr backgrounds have remained to this day unanswered .",
    "this behaviour is in turn intimately connected to the stability properties of the kerr metrics themselves as solutions of @xmath21 , and thus , with the very physical tenability of the notion of black hole . in particular , even the question of the uniform boundedness ( pointwise , or in energy ) of solutions @xmath7 to the linear wave equation @xmath22 in the domain of outer communications has not been previously resolved , except for the schwarzschild subfamily .",
    "the main theorems of this paper give the resolution of the boundedness problem for @xmath23 , for the case @xmath2 .",
    "solutions to @xmath23 arising from regular initial data remain uniformly bounded in the domain of outer communications .",
    "the bound is quantitative , i.e.  it is computable in terms of the initial supremum and initial energy - type quantities on initial data .",
    "in fact , the results of this paper apply to a much more general setting than the specific kerr metric : boundedness is proven for solutions of @xmath23 on the exterior region of any stationary axisymmetric spacetime sufficiently close to a schwarzschild spacetime with mass @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the methods may be of relevance in the ultimate goal of this analysis : understanding the dynamics of the einstein equations @xmath21 in a neighborhood of a kerr metric .",
    "we first give a statement of the main results for the special case of kerr and the related kerr - newman family ( this is a family of solutions to the coupled einstein - maxwell system ) .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the kerr solution with parameters @xmath24 or more generally the kerr - newman solution with parameters @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and let @xmath27 denote the closure of a domain of outer communications .",

    "there are no unphysical restrictions on the support of the solution in a neighborhood of @xmath78 .",
    "the results of theorems  [ prwto ] and  [ deutero ] remain true when the kerr or kerr - newman metric is replaced by an arbitrary stationary axisymmetric black hole exterior metric suitably close to schwarzschild , and with suitable assumptions on the geometry of the killing fields . in particular , in addition to smallness , it is required that  as in the kerr solution  the null generator of the horizon is in the span of the killing fields .",
    "the precise assumptions are outlined in section  [ ta3n ] .",
    "the elusiveness of the results of theorems  [ prwto ] and  [ deutero ] stems from the well - known phenomenon of _",
    "this is related to the fact that the killing field @xmath33 ( with respect to which the kerr solution is stationary ) is not everywhere - timelike in the domain of outer communications . in particular , there is a region of spacetime where @xmath33 is spacelike , the so - called _",
    "ergoregion_. the boundary of this region is called the _",
    "ergosphere_.    the presence of the ergoregion means that the energy current @xmath79 is not positive definite when integrated over spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "thus , the conservation of @xmath79 does not imply _ a priori _ bounds on an @xmath80-based quantity .",
    "in particular , the local energy of the solution can be greater than the initial total energy , even if the energy is initially supported where @xmath79 is positive definite . a test - particle version of this fact",
    ", where a particle coming in from infinity splits into one of negative energy entering the black hole and one of greater positive energy returning to infinity , is known as the _",
    "penrose process_. the pioneering study by christodoulou  @xcite of the `` black hole transformations '' obtainable via a penrose process led to a subject known as `` black hole thermodynamics '' .    in the physics literature , where discussion of these issues is inextricably linked to the separability of @xmath23 and decomposition of @xmath7 into modes ,",
    "the problem of the ergoregion appears as a formidable and perhaps intractable obstacle .",
    "it turns out , however , that there are other physical mechanisms at play which have an important role but are not necessarily well reflected from the point of view of separability .",
    "in particular , the tendency of waves to eventually disperse ( true in any asymptotically flat spacetime ) coupled with the powerful red - shift effect at the horizon . indeed , these properties , which depend only loosely on the stationarity , tend to make solutions not only stay bounded but decay to a constant in time , even if the local energy increases for a short time .    unfortunately , the dispersive properties of waves on black hole backgrounds are severely complicated by the presence of trapped null geodesics .",
    "( the presence of these can easily be inferred by a continuity argument in view of the fact that there exist both null geodesics crossing the horizon and going to null infinity . )",
    "it is only very recently that the role of trapping has been sufficiently well understood in the special case of the schwarzschild family to allow for the first proofs of decay for general solutions of @xmath23 on such backgrounds .",
    "see the results described in section  [ prevsch ] .    in the case of kerr ,",
    "the techniques introduced for controlling trapping on schwarzschild can not be readily perturbed .",
    "this has to do with the fact that these techniques seem to exploit the special property that the trapping concentrates asymptotically on a set of codimension @xmath81 in physical space , the so - called photon sphere .",
    "in contrast , in kerr the codimensionality of the space of trapped geodesics can only be properly understood in phase space .",
    "this indicates that controlling trapping requires a far more delicate analysis .",
    "it would appear from the above that the problem of superradiance could in principle be overcome , but at the expense of a very delicate analysis of trapping .",
    "a closer look , however , reveals that the situtation is considerably more favourable . at a heuristic level",
    ", the reason for this is the following remark : if one could separate out the `` superradiant '' part of the solution from the `` non - superradiant '' part , then one only has to exploit dispersion for the superradiant part .",
    "this latter problem turns out to be much easier than understanding dispersion for the whole solution .    to decompose the solution",
    ", we must first cut off the solution @xmath7 in the `` time''-interval of interest to obtain @xmath82 and then decompose into two pieces @xmath83 where @xmath84 is to be supported in frequency space ( real frequencies @xmath85 and integer @xmath86 here defined with respect to coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath87 ) only in the range @xmath88 , whereas @xmath89 is to be supported in frequency space only in the range @xmath90 . for spacetimes sufficiently close to schwarzschild , for a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath91 , one can view @xmath89 as essentially non - superradiant , and @xmath84 as the superradiant part .",
    "if one can show boundedness for @xmath89 and dispersion for @xmath84 , then one will have proven the uniform boundedness of the sum @xmath7 . for spacetimes sufficiently close to schwarzschild",
    ", one can choose @xmath91 sufficiently small so that trapping essentially does not occur for @xmath84 , and the dispersive mechanism of schwarzschild is stable .",
    "this relies on the stability of the red - shift effect for considerations close to the horizon .",
    "in complete contrast to the standard picture , it is the superradiant part of the solution which would be the better behaved one .    in practice ,",
    "the analysis is of course not as simple as what has been portrayed above , and here again , the stabilising effect of the red - shift acting near the horizon plays an important role . in view of the cutoffs in time , the equations satisfied by @xmath92 and @xmath89",
    "are coupled .",
    "moreover , the statement that @xmath89 is non - superradiant while @xmath84 is dispersive must also be understood modulo error terms .",
    "it turns out that to control these error terms , one of necessity must have at their disposal an energy quantity which does not degenerate on the horizon , that is to say , the @xmath80-based quantity for which one shows uniform boundedness must be the one of theorem  [ prwto ] , and not a quantity analogous to @xmath79 in schwarzschild . in particular , one must understand the red - shift mechanism even for the `` non - superradiant '' part @xmath89 , for which one does not understand dispersion .",
    "such stable estimates at the horizon ( corresponding to the energy measured by local observers ) exploiting the red - shift effect were first attained for schwarzschild in our previous  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that in  @xcite , understanding of the red - shift mechanism was always coupled with understanding dispersion , i.e.  controlling the trapping phenomenon . in particular ,",
    "one had to appeal to an understanding of dispersion even to obtain the result of theorems  [ prwto ] for schwarzschild . in this paper , we show how understanding the red - shift can be decoupled from understanding dispersion in the non - superradiant case .",
    "in addition , we show that the red - shift effect allows us to commute the wave equation with a vector field transverse to the horizon , yielding a new route to higher order estimates and pointwise estimates .",
    "an extra side - benefit of our results is thus a new , simpler and more robust proof of theorems  [ prwto ] and  [ deutero ] even for the case of schwarzschild .",
    "see section  [ further1 ] .",
    "we review in detail previous work on this and related problems .",
    "results of the type of theorems  [ prwto ] and  [ deutero ] for static perturbations of minkowski space pose little difficulty .",
    "( indeed , the analogue of theorem  [ prwto ] is immediate , and theorem  [ deutero ] can be proven with the help of sobolev inequalities after commuting the equation with the static killing field . )",
    "thus , we shall pass directly to the black hole case .",
    "the analogue of theorem  [ deutero ] for schwarzschild is a celebrated result of kay and wald  @xcite , building on previous work of wald  @xcite where the theorem had been proven for the restricted class of data whose support was assumed not to contain the bifurcation sphere @xmath93 . in view of the positive definiteness of @xmath79 in the domain of outer communications , the only essential difficulty is obtaining bounds for @xmath7 up to the horizon ( where @xmath33 becomes null ) , as bounds away from the horizon can be obtained essentially as described immediately above for static perturbations of minkowski space .",
    "the arguments of kay and wald to prove the analogue of theorem  [ deutero ] relied on the staticity to realize a solution @xmath7 as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is again a solution of  @xmath23 constructed by inverting an elliptic operator acting on initial data .",
    "in addition , a pretty geometric construction exploiting the discrete symmetries of maximal schwarzschild was used to remove the unphysical restriction on the support near @xmath93 necessary for constructing @xmath96 in the original  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these methods is particularly robust to perturbation .",
    "the reason the authors had to resort to such techniques was that theorem  [ deutero ] was proven _ without _ proving the analogue of theorem  [ prwto ] , rather , using only the conserved flux @xmath79 whose control degenerates as @xmath46 is approached .",
    "theorem  [ prwto ] for schwarzschild was only proven as part of the decay results of  @xcite to be discussed below .",
    "turning now to the issue of decay , the first non - quantitative decay result for @xmath23 on schwarzschild is contained in the thesis of twainy  @xcite .",
    "the first quantitative decay results for solutions of  @xmath23 on schwarzschild ( and more generally , reissner - nordstrm ) were proven in  @xcite , but were restricted to spherically symmetric solutions , or alternatively , the @xmath97th spherical harmonic @xmath98 of a general solution @xmath7 .",
    "( in fact , this was a byproduct of the main result of  @xcite , which concerns decay rates for spherically symmetric solutions to the coupled einstein-(maxwell)-scalar field system . )",
    "quantitative decay results for the whole solution @xmath7 , both pointwise and in energy , were proven in  @xcite , in particular , the uniform decay result @xmath99 is an eddington - finkelstein advanced time coordinate and @xmath100 is an appropriate quantity computable on initial data , and @xmath101 denotes say @xmath102 .",
    "inequality @xmath103 is sharp as a uniform decay rate in @xmath104 .",
    "the results of  @xcite exploit both the red - shift effect near the horizon and the dispersive properties .",
    "the estimates are derived using a variety of vector field multipliers , in particular , a vector field multiplier @xmath105 such that the flux of @xmath106 gives the local energy at the horizon .",
    "the energy identity of @xmath105 quantifies the red - shift effect .",
    "weaker decay results were proven independently by blue and sterbenz  @xcite for initial data vanishing on @xmath93 , but with control which degenerates on the horizon .",
    "in particular , the estimates of  @xcite are unstable to perturbation near the horizon .",
    "the stability of the estimates of  @xcite near the horizon will be of critical importance here .    both  @xcite and  @xcite control trapping effects with the help of vector field multipliers which must be carefully chosen for each spherical harmonic separately .",
    "these were inspired by a series of papers by soffer and collaborators , for instance  @xcite ; see , however  @xcite .",
    "the first proof of decay for @xmath7 not relying on spherical harmonic decomposition for the construction of these multipliers is provided by our more recent  @xcite .      since uniform boundedness is the most basic question which can be asked about @xmath23 on kerr , previous results in this setting are of necessity of a partial nature .",
    "in particular , essentially all previous work on @xmath23 is restricted to the projection of @xmath7 to a single azimuthal frequency , or equivalently , to the case where the data are of the form @xmath107 solutions arising from @xmath108 are then of the form @xmath109 .",
    "let us call such solutions azimuthal modes . in principle , one could attempt to deduce properties of general @xmath7 by summing relations deduced for each individual azimuthal mode . as we shall see , however , due to the non - quantitative nature of the results described below , in of themselves they unfortunately yield no information about general @xmath7 .",
    "nonetheless , even the study of such @xmath110 without regard to uniform control in @xmath86 turns out to be a non - trivial problem .",
    "indeed , even for such individual azimuthal modes , the most basic questions had not been previously answered , in particular , the analogue of theorems  [ prwto ] or  [ deutero ] .",
    "this being said , there are interesting partial results concerning @xmath108 that had been previously obtained .",
    "in particular , most recently finster _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite had been able to show for smooth @xmath110 that for fixed @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 under the assumption that the support of @xmath110 does not contain @xmath114 .",
    "see however  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can deduce @xmath115 for each fixed @xmath111 and @xmath112 , without however a bound on the @xmath116 .",
    "the results rest on an explicit integral representation of the solution which is derived using the remarkable ( but all too fragile ) separability properties of the kerr metric .",
    "the arguments contain many pretty applications of contour integral methods of classical complex analysis . since these techniques are essentially algebraic , no restriction on the size of @xmath117 need be made provided @xmath118 . in  @xcite , under the same assumption on the initial support , the authors deduce that for each @xmath119 , @xmath120 thus , the energy of each mode in the region @xmath121 remains finite but again , no quantitative bound in terms of data can be produced .",
    "moreover , from the results of  @xcite , one can not deduce that the @xmath116 of @xmath122 and @xmath123 commute with taking @xmath124 or @xmath125 , i.e.  @xmath122 is _ a priori _ compatible with @xmath110 blowing up along the horizon : @xmath126 and @xmath123 is compatible with infinite energy concentration near the horizon : @xmath127    as explained before , no statement could be inferred for the general solution @xmath7 from the above statements on individual azimuthal modes , not even a weak statement like @xmath122 or @xmath123 . this is because the @xmath128 and @xmath116 of @xmath129 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 do not _ a priori _ commute with summation over @xmath86 .",
    "must be understood as the projection @xmath110 , to agree with what is proven in the body of the paper .",
    "] of course , in view of theorems  [ prwto ] and  [ deutero ] , one can now infer from @xmath129 corollary  [ nqc ] of section  [ nqd ] .",
    "the somewhat unsatisfying nature of the above previous results deduced with the help of separability are indicative of how difficult it is to obtain quantitative statements about solutions of the wave equation @xmath23 even in the algebraically special case where one has explicit representations of the solution .",
    "perhaps this is for the best , however .",
    "remarkable though they are , the separability properties of the kerr metric are unstable to perturbation . just as in the case of stability of minkowski space  @xcite ,",
    "understanding the stability properties of the einstein equations near the kerr solution will undoubtedly require robust methods .",
    "we hope that the techniques employed here will have further applications in this direction .",
    "a related problem to the wave equation is that of the klein - gordon equation @xmath130 with @xmath131 . there is a well - developed scattering theory on schwarzschild for the class of solutions of @xmath132 with finite energy associated to the killing @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , an asymptotic completeness statement has been proven in  @xcite .",
    "this analysis in of itself , however , when specialised to @xmath74 solutions in the geometric sense , only gives very weak information about the solution .",
    "in particular , it does not give @xmath80 control of @xmath7 or its angular derivatives on @xmath46 .",
    "in the case of kerr , there are again certain partial results for @xmath132 in the direction of scattering for a `` non - superradiant '' subspace of initial data  @xcite . these interesting results do not , however , address the characteristic difficulties of superradiance .",
    "see also  @xcite .",
