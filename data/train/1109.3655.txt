    "for a number of reasons , ranging from dark energy and accelerated expansion of the universe to astronomical tests , modified version of general relativity gained considerable interest in recent times .",
    "@xmath0 gravity , in particular , attracted much attention in this context ( see @xcite for comprehensive reviews of the subject ) .",
    "the reason for this trend may be attributed to the dependence of its lagrangian on the ricci scalar alone , so that it can be handled relatively simpler in comparison with the higher order curvature invariants .",
    "depending on the structure of the function @xmath0 the nonlinearity creates curvature sources which may be interpreted as sources without sources , manifesting themselves in the einstein equations . beside these curvature ( or geometrical ) sources",
    "there may be true physical sources that contribute together with the former to determine the total source in the problem .",
    "it should be added that owing to highly nonlinear structure of the underlying field equations attaining exact solutions is not an easy task at all . in spite of all odds",
    "many exact solutions have been obtained from ab initio assumed @xmath0 functions . to recall an example we refer to the choice @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 an arbitrary number ) which attains an electromagnetic - like curvature source , so that @xmath12 can be interpreted as an electric charge without charge @xcite .",
    "that is , the resulting geometry becomes equivalent to the reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) geometry in a spherically symmetry metric ansatz of einstein s gravity .",
    "this particular example reveals that the failure of certain tests related to solar system / cosmology in @xmath0 gravity is accountable by the curvature sources in the einstein hilbert action .",
    "equivalence with @xmath13(scalar fields ) provides another such example beside the electromagnetic one .",
    "more recently we obtained a large class of non - analytical @xmath0 gravity solutions minimally coupled with yang - mills ( ym ) field @xcite .",
    "even more to this the ym field was allowed to be a nonlinear theory in which the power - ym constitutes a particular example in all higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , in @xmath14 , @xmath15 solves the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) system exactly . for @xmath16",
    "our solution for nonabelian gauge reduces to an abelian one which may be considered as an einstein - maxwell ( em ) solution @xcite .",
    "previously @xmath0 gravity coupled non - minimally with yang - mills and maxwell matter sources have been considered @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a particular class within minimally coupled ym field in @xmath0 gravity with the conditions that the scalar curvature @xmath17 constant and the trace of the ym energy - momentum tensor is zero .",
    "( to see other black hole solutions with matter in @xmath0 gravity we refer to ref .",
    "contrary to our expectations this turns out to be a non - trivial class with far - reaching consequences .",
    "our spacetime is chosen spherically symmetric to be in accord with the spherically symmetric wu - yang ansatz for the ym field .",
    "the field equations admit exact solutions in all dimensions @xmath2 with the physical parameters ; mass ( @xmath18 ) of the black hole , ym charge ( @xmath19 ) and the scalar curvature ( @xmath20 ) of the space time . in this picture",
    "we note that cosmological constant arises automatically as proportional to @xmath20 . from physics stand point , considering equation of state in the form @xmath3 , with effective pressure ( @xmath21 ) and density ( @xmath22 ) , important results are obtained as follow : for a critical value of @xmath23 we have @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "remarkably this amounts to a sign shift in the effective pressure to account for the accelerated expansion of a universe centered by a charged black hole . in general",
    "the critical distance is thermodynamically unstable so that the universe undergoes the phase of accelerated expansion beyond that particular distance .",
    "absence of the phantom era ( i.e. @xmath28 ) is also manifest .",
    "alternatively , in the limit @xmath29 it yields @xmath30 ( i.e. @xmath31dimensional ultra relativistic case ) , while for @xmath32 we have @xmath7 , the case of a pure cosmological constant .",
    "let us note that the latter case corresponds to vanishing of the ym field",
    ". stated otherwise , in the overall space time we do not have a fixed value for @xmath9 .",
    "depending on the distance from the center ( or horizon ) of a black hole we have a varying state parameter @xmath8 . the same argument in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) version of the theory",
    "implies that beyond a critical time @xmath33 , @xmath34 changes its role and a different type of matter becomes active .",
    "it is known that for the normal and dark matters which provide clustering both the weak energy condition ( wec ) and the strong energy condition ( sec ) must be satisfied . in the case of dark energy on the other hand wec",
    "is satisfied while sec is violated . in appendix",
    "a we analyze the energy conditions thoroughly covering all dimensions .",
    "although our metric ansatz is chosen to be spherically symmetric so that the constant scalar curvature @xmath35 , in order to prepare ground for the topological black holes we consider the case of @xmath36 as well .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our formalism and present exact solutions .",

    "the constancy of the ricci scalar amounts to @xmath86which yields@xmath87where @xmath69 and @xmath18 are two integration constants . from the einstein equations one identifies the constant @xmath69  as@xmath88 in the next section we investigate physical properties of our solution in all dimensions .",
    "in @xmath31dimensions , we know that the nonabelian @xmath89 gauge field coincides with the abelian @xmath90 maxwell field @xcite . due to its importance we shall study the @xmath31dimensional case separately and give the results explicitly .",

    "let us add that in order to preserve the sign of the charge term in ( 27 ) we must abide by the choice @xmath35 . however , simultaneous limits @xmath97 and @xmath98 , so that @xmath99constant , leads also to an acceptable solution within @xmath100 gravity @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see here that @xmath18 is the adm mass of the resulting black hole .",
    "viability of the pure @xmath101 model which has recently been considered critically @xcite is known to avoid the dolgov - kawasaki instability @xcite .",
    "further , in the late time behaviour of the expanding universe ( i.e. for @xmath102 ) it asymptotes to the de sitter / anti de sitter form .",
    "with reference to @xcite we admit that sourceless @xmath95 model does nt possess a good record as far as the solar system tests are concerned .",
    "herein we have sources and wish to address the universe at large .",
    "now , we follow @xcite to give the form of the entropy akin to the possible black hole solution . from the area relation",
    "the entropy of the modified gravity with constant curvature is given by@xmath103which upon insertion from ( 19 ) becomes@xmath104where @xmath105 indicates the event horizon .",
