    "<S> introduction_. continuous - variable quantum - key distribution ( cvqkd ) , which exploits two beams [ the signal beam carrying the encoding information and the local oscillator ( lo ) as a phase reference of the signal state used for balanced homodyne detection ] to distribute secret keys between two legitimate parties ( alice and bob ) , has received great developments in the past decade @xcite . since the grosshans - grangier protocol ( gg02 protocol ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was first proposed in 2002 , various experimental implementations of cvqkd have been carried out by a few groups @xcite , which makes the cvqkd more promising and practical .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , the security of cvqkd has been demonstrated theoretically @xcite , but the practical system s security is still the focus of research , such as the analysis of imperfections and the discovery of loopholes of practical systems @xcite . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , lo was pointed out to be a vulnerability for the practical system , since it is under eve s control . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we showed that lo intensity fluctuations open a loophole for eve and small fluctuations could compromise the security of the practical cvqkd system severely . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we point out that lo should be monitored accurately and bob s measurements should be scaled with the instantaneous intensity value of each pulse of lo . however , scaling each pulse s measurement with the instantaneous value makes bob s measuring complicated . besides , the analysis in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was carried out with a perfect balanced homodyne detector ( bhd ) , however , for a nonideal bhd , eve still could intercept partial secret keys as analyzed in the rest of this paper if bob takes the instantaneous normalization .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> to guarantee the security of the practical system , we propose an alternative countermeasure to solve this problem ; i.e. , bob actively stabilizes lo to defeat eve s lo intensity attack ( loia , see details in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . furthermore , based on this countermeasure , we point out that the lo could be manipulated not only by eve to attack the system , but also by bob in turn to increase the secret key rate over a noisy channel , due to the fact that the variation of lo can change the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a practical bhd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulation shows that this manipulation of lo can improve the resistance of a practical system to the channel excess noise and may reduce the requirement on bhd ( i.e. , high detection efficiency and low electronic noise ) , just by bob tuning and stabilizing lo intensity to a required optimal constant value . before describing this countermeasure , </S>",
    "<S> we first analyze the effect of loia on a practical imperfect bhd of bob .    </S>",
    "<S> _ nonideal bhd attack_. in realistic experiments , the nonideal bhd of bob is characterized by the detection efficiency @xmath0 and the electronic noise @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> electronic noise is considered as trust noise ( the so - called realistic model @xcite ) that eve can not exploit to acquire information , and its value is calibrated before key distribution based on measuring the variance of bhd when no beams are present . </S>",
    "<S> hence , when the lo intensity fluctuates during the key distribution , this variance after being scaled with the lo instantaneous intensity value ( thus called the normalized electronic - noise variance @xmath1 ) will vary certainly , and thus the snr of bhd @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for an ideal bhd , the output of its measurement is @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplitude of lo , @xmath4 is the relative phase between the signal and lo , and @xmath5 are the quadratures of the signal state . </S>",
    "<S> the rotated quadrature @xmath6 can be measured with different @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : x0 ] ) characterizes a perfect bhd with unity detection efficiency , negligible losses , perfect balancing , and the ideal mode compatibility between the signal and lo . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a nonideal bhd , the measured result reads @xcite @xmath7 here @xmath0 is the detection efficiency , thus @xmath8 represents the total optical loss , @xmath9 represents the quadrature of the vacuum mode , @xmath10 represents the detection noise of bhd and mainly indicates the electronic noise when lo is sufficiently bright ( typically @xmath11 photons per pulse ) .    from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : x00 ] ) , we can see that when the output of bhd is scaled with @xmath12 @xcite and made statistics with a sufficient number of pulses , the variance of electronic noise can be described as @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> if the lo intensity @xmath14 is a constant , the electronic noise can be calibrated as a confirmative constant during the calibration procedure . </S>",
    "<S> however , when lo fluctuates in time during the key distribution and we scale bob s measurement with the lo instantaneous intensity value of each pulse ( proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) instead of the initial calibrated value , the electronic noise will vary , and especially will decrease when @xmath14 becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in this case , we can not compute the exact value of @xmath1 because , on one hand , we do not know the value of @xmath10 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : x00 ] ) during key distribution , and on the other , hand the probability distribution of @xmath14 as a random variable is also unknown or unfixed since lo intensity fluctuations are under eve s control and she can manipulate them arbitrarily .    in the realistic model , </S>",
    "<S> the electronic noise is considered as trust noise @xcite , and its small variations have little impact on the secret key rate of alice and bob as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the electronic noise varies , especially becomes small , bob will underestimate the channel excess noise , since he can not know exactly the electronic noise value when he uses the lo instantaneous intensity value to scale his measurements for each pulse . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this will make the secret key rate compromised as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) ; i.e. , when the electronic noise decreases , bob will overestimate his secret key rate if he still uses the initial electronic noise to calculate the key rate with the realistic model .    </S>",

    "<S> the three curves almost overlapping indicates that the variations of the electronic noise as a trust noise have little impact on the key rate . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) truly secret key rate with the case that the decrease of the electronic noise hides the channel excess noise . </S>",
    "<S> solid line indicates @xmath17 is ( 0.2 , 0.041 ) , dashed line [ @xmath18 , 0.0359 ] and dotted line [ @xmath19 , 0.0205 ] where @xmath20 is the channel transmission , provided that the total noise refereed to the channel input , @xmath21 , keeps constant . </S>",
    "<S> bob has no idea about the real electronic noise when lo fluctuates , so if he still considers @xmath22 in the above three cases , he will overestimate his key rates in the later two cases ( see text for further details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are plotted for alice s mode variance @xmath23 ( in shot - noise units ) with bhd parameters selected as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) . ]    figure [ fig:1](b ) describes the cases that channel excess noise is too high while the real electronic noise decreases drastically , so the secret key rate is compromised severely if the initial calibrated normalized electronic noise is still used in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , if bob classifies his measurements by different values of @xmath14 during the parameter estimation procedure , and estimates an average value of normalized electronic noise using the statistic distribution of @xmath14 , he still can not estimate the exact secure rates using the realistic model . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the mean value of electronic noise is not the real one ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> the expression of @xmath1 ) and the statistic probability distribution of @xmath14 in the parameter estimation procedure can not represent the one in the key extraction procedure since it can be arbitrary as mentioned earlier . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> eve still could fool alice and bob by the appropriate manipulation of the intensity of lo .    </S>",
    "<S> in practical experiments , however , the fluctuation of lo is small and channel excess noise is also very small . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the electronic noise also varies a bit and has little impact on the key rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case , we have to discard pulses with large fluctuation of lo since this large fluctuation will largely change the snr of a practical bhd . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this will decrease the efficiency of key distribution . </S>",
    "<S> note that the channel excess noise is under eve s control , so if eve implements this nonideal bhd attack , lo fluctuations still open a loophole .    _ </S>",
    "<S> countermeasure_. however , if we can stabilize the intensity of lo as a constant before the homodyne detection , the above problem will be solved automatically and eve s attack proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will also be avoided efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:2 ] gives a schematic setup to stabilize the intensity of each pulse of lo , which consists of monitoring lo by splitting a small part with an asymmetric splitter and amplifying or attenuating the lo intensity based on the monitoring value . </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose of a relatively simple implementation , for example , we can use a beam splitter , whose transmission is variable , to tune the lo intensity and stabilize it to a required constant value .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) schematic setup for stabilizing the intensity of lo . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of monitoring each pulse s intensity by splitting a small part of it and using an amplifier or attenuator to amplify or attenuate each pulse which thus stabilizes each pulse s intensity identical with the initial calibrated value . </S>",

    "<S> additionally , with the proposed setup we can tune the lo intensity to an any permitted constant value , thus the snr ( shot - noise to electronic noise ratio ) of bhd can be changed to a desired value , which will bring out some merits for cvqkd over a noisy channel .    </S>",
    "<S> _ increase secret keys_. as shown in the previous section , tuning the intensity of lo changes the snr of a practical bhd @xcite , which may improve the tolerance of a practical system to channel excess noise . </S>",
    "<S> we begin this analysis by first pointing out that adding some noise , classical or quantum , to the reference partner of reconciliation can increase the secret key rate over a noisy channel regardless of the discrete or continuous variable qkd protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , garca - patrn and cerf proposed a new protocol based on squeezed states and heterodyne detection , which is equivalent to the protocol based on squeezed states and homodyne detection but adding some noise on bob . </S>",
    "<S> this additional noise , as a trust noise which is not induced by eve , makes the protocol more robust against the channel excess noise because it is more detrimental to eve than to bob . as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there is an optimal added noise on the data of the reference partner of reconciliation for a fixed channel excess noise based on squeezed states and homodyne detection ; we show that the same is also true of the protocol with coherent states and homodyne detection ( see details in appendix [ sec : noisy ] ) .    hence , in the practical coherent state cvqkd implementation over a noisy channel , we can add some gaussian noise to bob s homodyne detection to increase the secret key rate . over this added noise , the noisy homodyne protocol incredibly improves the resistance to channel excess noise as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we also plot the added optimal gaussian noise [ solid line in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:4](b ) ] for a fixed detection efficiency @xmath31 ( selected as ref .  @xcite ) to realize the case of adding optimal gaussian noise . </S>",
    "<S> it is counterintuitive that , for higher channel losses than a given threshold , electronic noise can be beneficial for increasing the secret key rate in cvqkd with the reverse reconciliation ( rr ) protocol over a noisy channel . as the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed , instead of using a random number generator to generate the noise @xmath28 , bob can do it physically by tuning the efficiency of his detector . </S>",
    "<S> however , bob can also realize it by tuning the electronic noise in some limited range , or simultaneously tuning the efficiency and the electronic noise to match the added noise @xmath28 .    as previous sections analyzed </S>",
    "<S> , we can change the snr or the normalized electronic noise of bhd by tuning the lo intensity . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](b ) , we plot the gain @xmath33 of lo corresponding to the optimal electronic noise on the right vertical axis ( see bold dotted line ) and select @xmath34 when the electronic noise is @xmath35 ( black circle dot ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the higher intensity of lo , the bhd will saturate and thus can not work , but decreasing less than one order of electronic noise ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) may be still realistic in the current setup @xcite . note that , in this case , we must be very careful since eve may implement a _ saturation attack _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite on the practical bhd . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we must monitor the mean of bob s data carefully to avoid this attack ( see details in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the improved performance by tuning lo intensity to higher intensity may be limited in this region . by contrast , </S>",
    "<S> for the lower intensity of lo , the noise of bhd may be higher than what fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](b ) shows , because there are other excess noises not controlled by eve , except the electronic noise in the bhd ; i.e. , the snr of bhd is not linear dependent on the intensity of lo when lo is not strong and the other excess noise can be still taken as a trust noise . consequently , with the setup of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , we can always tune the intensity of lo in the calibration procedure to get the optimal trust added noise supplied by bhd to improve the performance of a practical system over a noisy and lossy channel , and stabilize it on a constant value to avoid eve s attack on lo during the key distribution . although this tuning or improvement may be limited , it is still worth testing in practical experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion and open problem_. in the previous sections we have described a schematic setup that can tune the intensity of each pulse of lo to a desired value thus stabilize lo . if we can amplify the intensity of each pulse without changing its phase </S>",
    "<S> , the intensity of lo sent by alice can not be so strong , which thus could reduce the crosstalk between the signal and lo when they are multiplexed into a same optical fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the channel excess noise induced by this crosstalk can be reduced dramatically , which also improves the performance of a practical system of cvqkd . besides </S>",
    "<S> , a general amplifier or attenuator may introduce some phase - insensitive noise , which still can be measured and thus regarded as trust noise to bob s data . </S>",
    "<S> but in this case , we should carefully select these components , avoiding that the introduced extra noise by them exceeds the optimal trust added noise .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been reported that the coherent state cvqkd system was integrated into cryptographic qkd networks and passed some field tests , which confirms the integrability and reliability of it @xcite . for a field implementation , </S>",
    "<S> the channel excess noise is much higher than that of the experimental test and lo also fluctuates dramatically for a long transmission distance . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our proposed stabilization system may be useful and practical for this case , especially for the metropolitan qkd network . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the electronic noise may be beneficial for the cvqkd rr protocol over a noisy channel , the requirement on a practical bhd ( high efficiency and low electronic noise ) can be reduced for high channel excess noise , and in this circumstance the snr of bhd is not necessarily much higher , which means that the lo intensity can be much lower than the typical value @xmath11 photons per pulse . in other words , we only need to let the snr ( here the noise includes the equivalent noise induced by the detection efficiency ) of a practical bhd match the channel excess noise for the rr protocol . </S>",
    "<S> it can be realized just by tuning the detection efficiency and lo intensity as the above analyzed for a given bhd , though its performance may be limited for low channel excess noise .    however , we point out that there still exist two open problems to be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> first , the above schematic setup needs to be verified experimentally with current facilities and technologies , however , stabilizing each pulse to a constant level may be a big challenge , so seeking good methods will be an interesting and useful target . </S>",
    "<S> second , since the electronic noise may be beneficial for increasing the secret key rate over a noisy channel , it will be very interesting whether the measurement of this bhd is valid or accessible when the normalized electronic noise is close to or even higher than the shot - noise level [ as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](b ) ] , which still needs the experimental verification .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_. we analyzed the effect of the lo fluctuation on a practical imperfect bhd in details , and find that lo fluctuation can affect the snr of bhd , which can not be measured and is thus unknown to bob . </S>",
    "<S> this could compromise the security of a practical system of cvqkd . </S>",
    "<S> hence , bob needs to scale his measurements with the instantaneous lo intensity value when lo fluctuates in a extremely small range and select the smallest electronic noise of bhd in this range as the trust noise to calculate the secret key rate . </S>",
    "<S> so pulses with a large fluctuation of lo still need to be discarded due to its big change on the snr of bhd , which thus reduces the efficiency of key distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , we proposed a schematic stabilization system to stabilize the intensity of lo , which could solve this problem and avoid eve s attack on lo . </S>",
    "<S> then , we studied the impact of gaussian phase - insensitive noise on the secret key rate for a practical cvqkd system with an rr coherent state protocol , and showed that tuning the lo intensity thus changing the snr of bhd could increase the secret key rate over a noisy channel . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can enhance the security of a practical cvqkd system , especially the system integrated into the qkd metropolitan networks , which has high channel excess noise and dramatic lo fluctuation , just by the manipulation of lo , i.e. , tuning and stabilizing the intensity of lo .    </S>",
