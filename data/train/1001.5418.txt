    "the epitaxy of magnetically doped semiconductors constitutes a versatile mean of fabricating in a self - organized way semiconductor / ferromagnet nanocomposites@xcite with still widely unexplored but remarkable functionalities relevant to spintronics , nanoelectronics , photonics , and plasmonics . in these nanocomposite materials",
    "the presence of robust ferromagnetism correlates with the existence of nanoscale volumes containing a large density of magnetic cations , that is with the formation of condensed magnetic semiconductors ( cmss ) buried in the host matrix and characterized by a high spin ordering temperature.@xcite the aggregation of cmss and , therefore , the ferromagnetism of the resulting composite system shows a dramatic dependence on the growth conditions and co - doping with shallow impurities .    in particular , the understanding and control of cmss in tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductor films containing transition metals ( tms )  typical examples being ( ga , mn)as,@xcite ( ga , mn)n,@xcite ( ge , mn),@xcite ( zn , cr)te,@xcite and ( ga",
    ", fe)n @xcite  have been lately carefully considered with the necessary aid of nanoscale characterization techniques .",
    "indeed , the control over the cmss formation as a function of the fabrication parameters , and the possibility to reliably produce on demand cmss with a predefined size , structure , and distribution in the semiconductor host , are fundamental requisites for the exploitation of these nanostructures in functional devices . at the same time these studies draw us nearer to understand the origin of the ferromagnetic - like features  persisting up to above room temperature ( rt )  found in a number of semiconductors and oxides .",
    "@xcite    dilute zincblende ( ga , mn)as grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) is known to decompose upon annealing with the formation of embedded mnas nanocrystals coherent with the gaas matrix,@xcite and a striking spin - battery effect produced by these cmss has been already proven.@xcite as an example of the critical role played by growth parameters , mbe ge@xmath13mn@xmath9 grown below 130@xmath2c is seen to promote the self - assembling of coherent magnetic mn - rich nanocolumns whilst a higher growth temperature leads to the formation of hexagonal ge@xmath14mn@xmath4 nanocrystals buried in the ge host.@xcite    following theoretical suggestions,@xcite it has recently been demonstrated experimentally that it is possible to change the charge state of tm ions in a semiconducting matrix and , therefore , the aggregation energy by co - doping with shallow donors or acceptors.@xcite in particular , it has been proven that in the model case of wurtzite ( wz ) ( ga , fe)n fabricated by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe ) the fermi - level tuning by co - doping with mg ( acceptor in gan ) or si ( donor in gan ) is instrumental in controlling the magnetic ions aggregation.@xcite    the same system has been thoroughly analyzed at the nanoscale by means of advanced electron microscopy as well as by synchrotron - based diffraction and absorption techniques .",
    "the structural characteristics have then been related  together with the growth parameters  to the magnetic properties of the material as evidenced by superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometry.@xcite it has been concluded that for a concentration of fe below its optimized solubility limit ( @xmath15% of the magnetic ions ) the dilute system is predominantly paramagnetic ( pm ) . for higher concentrations of the magnetic ions (",
    "ga , fe)n shows either chemical- ( intermediate state ) or crystallographic - phase separation .",
    "@xcite in the phase - separated layers a ferromagnetic ( fm ) behavior persisting far above rt is observed , and has been related to the presence of either fe - rich regions coherent with the host gan ( in the intermediate state ) or of fe@xmath16n nanocrystals in the gan matrix .",
    "these investigations appear to elucidate the microscopic origin of the magnetic behavior of ( ga , fe)n reported by other groups .",
    "@xcite    along the above mentioned lines , in this work we consider further the movpe ( ga , fe)n material system and we reconstruct the phase diagram of the fe@xmath16n nanocrystals buried in gan as a function of the growth temperature . synchrotron radiation x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) , extended fine structure x - ray absorption ( exafs ) and x - ray absorption near - edge fine structure ( xanes ) , combined with high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) and squid magnetometry allow us to detect and to identify particular fe@xmath16n phases in samples fabricated at different growth temperatures @xmath0 as well as to establish a correlation between the existence of the specific phases and the magnetic response of the system .",
    "our results imply , in particular , that self assembled nanocrystals with a high concentration of the magnetic constituent account for ferromagnetic - like features persisting up to above rt . these findings for ( ga , fe)n do not support , therefore , the recent suggestions that high temperature ferromagnetism of ",
    "the closely related ",
    "oxides is brought about by spin polarization of defects , whereas the role of magnetic impurities is to bring the fermi energy to an appropriate position in the band gap .",
    "@xcite    we find that already a 5% variation in the growth temperature is critical for the onset of new fe@xmath16n species and we can confirm that an increase in the growth temperature promotes the aggregation of the magnetic ions , resulting in an enhanced density of fe - rich nanocrystals in the matrix and in a consequent increase of the ferromagnetic response of the system .",
    "moreover , we observe that while in the low - range of growth temperatures the fe - rich nanoobjects tend to segregate close to the sample surface , at higher @xmath0 two - dimensional assemblies of nanocrystals form in a reproducible way at different depths in the layer , an arrangement expected to have a potential as template for the self - aggregation of metallic nanocolumns.@xcite the non - uniform distribution of magnetic aggregates over the film volume here revealed , implies also that the cms detection may be challenging and , in general , requires a careful examination of the whole layer , including the surface and interfacial regions .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give a concise summary of the movpe process employed to fabricate the ( ga , fe)n phase - separated samples together with a brief description of the characterization techniques . a table with the relevant samples and relative parameters completes this part . the central results of this work are reported in section iii and are presented in two sub - sections discussing respectively : i ) the detection , identification and structural properties @xmath17 @xmath0 of the different fe@xmath16n nanocrystals in phase - separated ( ga , fe)n , with the distribution of the nanocrystals in the sample volume , and ii ) the magnetic properties of the specific families of fe@xmath16n phases . in section iv we sum up the main conclusions and the prospects of this work .",
    "we summarize here our study by considering a series of wurtzite ( ga , fe)n samples fabricated by movpe in an aixtron 200 rf horizontal reactor .",
    "all structures have been deposited on @xmath18-plane sapphire substrates with tmga ( trimethylgallium ) , nh@xmath4 , and fecp@xmath12 ( ferrocene ) as precursors for , respectively , ga , n and fe , and with h@xmath12 as carrier gas .    the growth process has been carried out according to a well established procedure,@xcite namely : substrate nitridation , low temperature ( 540@xmath2c ) deposition of a gan nucleation layer ( nl ) , annealing of the nl under nh@xmath4 until recrystallization and the growth of a @xmath19  1  @xmath20 m thick device - quality gan buffer at 1030@xmath2c . on the gan buffer ,",
    "fe - doped gan overlayers ( @xmath19  700  nm thick ) have been deposited at different @xmath0 ranging from 800@xmath2c to 950@xmath2c , with a v / iii ratio of 300 [ nh@xmath4 and tmga source flow of 1500 standard cubic centimeters per minute ( sccm ) and 5  sccm , respectively ] , with an average growth - rate of 0.21 nm / s , and the flow - rate of the fe - precursor set at 300  sccm . during the whole growth process",
    "the samples have been continuously rotated in order to promote the deposition homogeneity , while _ in situ _ and on line ellipsometry is employed for the real time control over the entire fabrication process .",
    "the considered samples main parameters , including the fe concentration , are displayed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "[ h ]    .[tab : table1 ] considered ( ga , fe)n samples with the corresponding growth temperature , fe concentration as evaluated by secondary ions mass spectroscopy ( sims ) as well as concentration of the dilute paramagnetic fe@xmath1 ions @xmath21 and a lower limit of the concentration of fe ions @xmath22 contributing to the fe - rich nanocrystals , as obtained from magnetization data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     further focused studies are required in order to clarify the kinetic mechanisms of segregation and possibly the range of parameters that could allow the selectivity of the species in different two - dimensional regions of the doped layers .",
    "as reported in table  [ tab : table2 ] , the different fe@xmath9n phases we identify in the considered samples are expected to show specific magnetic responses . the @xmath23-fe@xmath4n phase , predominant in the samples grown at 850@xmath2c , is ferromagnetic with a curie temperature @xmath24 of 575  k.@xcite    the @xmath8-fe@xmath6n phase , also present though in lesser amount in these layers , is fm too , with a @xmath24 of 750  k.@xcite for the samples deposited at temperatures above 850@xmath2c , the dominant and stable phase becomes @xmath11-fe@xmath12n .",
    "the magnetic response of these ( ga , fe)n layers is quite typical for semiconductors containing tm ions at concentration above or close to the solubility limits .",
    "regardless of the prevailing diamagnetic component from the sapphire substrate  that we compensate with the procedure detailed elsewhere @xcite  the field dependency of magnetization @xmath25 is characterized primarily by a dominant paramagnetic contribution at low temperatures from diluted substitutional fe@xmath1 ions and by a superparamagnetic - like component saturating ( relatively ) fast and originating from various magnetically ordered nanocrystals with high fe content . among them , the fm hexagonal @xmath23-fe@xmath26n have the highest density , according to the sxrd and hrtem studies discussed above . despite the richness of different phases , it is relatively straightforward to separate these major components and to treat them  to a large extent  qualitatively .",
    "we begin by noting that the superparamagnetic - like component originates primarily from nanocrystals characterized by a relatively high magnitude of the spin ordering temperature , so that their magnetization @xmath27 can be regarded as temperature independent at very low temperatures .",
    "this means that a temperature dependence of the magnetization in this range comes from dilute fe@xmath1 ions , whose properties in gan have been extensively investigated previously.@xcite     as a function of the growth temperature . ]    accordingly , the concentration of these ions @xmath21 can be obtained by fitting @xmath28@xmath29 to the difference between the experimental values of the magnetization measured at 1.85 and 5.0  k , where @xmath30 is the difference of the corresponding paramagnetic brillouin functions @xmath31 .",
    "we consider the spin @xmath32 , the corresponding land factor @xmath33 , and treat @xmath21 as the only fitting parameter .",
    "the values established in this way are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] for the studied samples and they are then employed to calculate the paramagnetic contribution at any temperature according to @xmath34 , which is then subtracted from the experimental data to obtain the magnitude of the magnetization @xmath27 coming from nanocrystals .    for the layers grown at @xmath35 900@xmath2c , @xmath27 saturates at all investigated temperatures for a magnetic field above @xmath36  koe , as evidenced in fig .  [",
    "fig : figandhistandfmt](a ) , pointing to a predominantly ferromagnetic order within the nanocrystals .",
    "the values of saturation magnetization @xmath37 obtained in this way when plotted _ vs. _ temperature as in fig .  [ fig : figandhistandfmt](b ) allow us to assess the corresponding @xmath24 from a fitting of the classical brillouin function to the experimental points .",
    "furthermore , assuming a value of the magnetic moment 2@xmath38 per fe , as in @xmath23-fe@xmath4n,@xcite we determine the concentration of fe ions @xmath22 contributing to the fe - rich nanocrystals , as shown in table  i.    however , for the samples deposited at @xmath39 900@xmath2c the magnitude of @xmath40 saturates only at relatively high temperatures , namely around @xmath41  k , whereas at low temperatures it shows the sizable contribution of a slowly saturating component , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figandhistandfmt](c ) where magnetization data acquired at @xmath42  k for the layer s691 are reported .",
    "this new contribution must arise from magnetically coupled objects with a spin arrangement other than ferromagnetic . according to the sxrd measurements previously discussed and summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxrd ] the most likely candidate is orthorombic @xmath11-fe@xmath12n , antiferromagnetic below 9  k,@xcite or slowly saturating weakly ferromagnetic below 30  k.@xcite in this case , in order to establish @xmath37 we employ the arrot plot method . the value of @xmath43 determined in this way is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : figandhistandfmt](d ) , and is seen to differ considerably from that of layers grown at lower @xmath0 .",
    "we are able to approximate the experimental values of @xmath43 with a single brillouin function only for @xmath44  k ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : figandhistandfmt](d ) ) .",
    "this points to a lower value of @xmath45  k , indicating a shift of the chemical composition of @xmath23-fe@xmath26n from fe@xmath4n ( @xmath46 ) for @xmath35 900@xmath2c to at most fe@xmath47n ( @xmath48 ) for @xmath49 900@xmath2c , as @xmath24 of @xmath23-fe@xmath26n decreases with increasing nitrogen content.@xcite    moreover , the gradually increasing values of @xmath43 below @xmath50  k , marked as the hatched area in fig .",
    "[ fig : figandhistandfmt](d ) , indicate the presence of even more diluted @xmath23-fe@xmath26n nanocrystals with @xmath51 ranging from 0.5 to 1 and with a wide spectrum of @xmath24 .",
    "importantly , since @xmath23-fe@xmath26n preserves its crystallographic structure and the changes of the lattice parameters are minor in the whole range @xmath52 , all various @xmath23-fe@xmath26n nanocrystals contribute to the same diffraction peak in the sxrd spectrum , and are detected there as a single compound .",
    "we note that the presence of either @xmath23-fe@xmath4n or @xmath11-fe@xmath12n , characterized by a low spin ordering temperature , does not hinder the determination of the @xmath21 values , as both compounds have a rather low magnetic moment of @xmath53 per fe atom .",
    "accordingly , the resulting variation of their magnetization is small comparing to the changes of the fe@xmath1 paramagnetic signal at low temperatures .",
    "the procedure exemplified above allows us to establish the lower limit for the fe concentration that precipitates in the form of various fe - rich nanocrystals ( @xmath22 ) , and that is determined by the magnitude of @xmath37 at low temperatures .",
    "we again assume @xmath54 per fe atom , as in the dominant @xmath23-fe@xmath4n .",
    "these values are collected in table  [ tab : table1 ] and plotted as the function of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : figfmconc2 ] .",
    "we see , that @xmath22 consistently increases with @xmath0 , and that the growth temperature plays a more crucial role than the fe - precursor flow rate  @xcite in establishing the total value of @xmath22 .",
    "finally , measurements of fc and zfc magnetization confirm the superparamagnetic - like behavior of @xmath27 , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : figfczfc ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : figfczfc](a ) , the layer grown at the lowest temperature ( s690 ) shows a minimal spread in @xmath55 , having its maximum at @xmath56  k , and accordingly a non - zero coercivity is evident only at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , for most of the studied layers a broad maximum on the zfc curve , exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : figfczfc](b ) , indicates a wide spread of blocking temperatures ( @xmath55 )  reaching rt  and consequently a broad distribution in the volume of the nanocrystals .",
    "these high values of @xmath55 are responsible for the existence of the open hysteresis in the @xmath25 curves seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : figandhistandfmt](a),(c ) and thus of a non - zero coercivity .",
    "this observation again points to the growth temperature as to the key factor in the determination of the crystallographic structure , size and chemical composition of the fe - rich nanocrystals .",
    "[ h ]    oe for samples grown at ( a ) 800@xmath2c and ( b ) 950@xmath2c . ]",
    "the previous@xcite and present studies allow us to draw a number of conclusions concerning the incorporation of fe into gan and about the resulting magnetic properties , expected to be generic for a broad class of magnetically doped semiconductors and oxides .",
    "these materials show magnetization consisting typically of two components : i ) a paramagnetic contribution appearing at low temperatures and with characteristics typical for dilute magnetic semiconductors containing weakly interacting randomly distributed magnetic moments ; ii ) a puzzling ferromagnetic - like component persisting up to above rt but with a value of remanence much smaller than the magnitude of saturation magnetization .    according to squid and electron paramagnetic resonance  @xcite measurements on ( ga , fe)n , the concentration of ga substituting the randomly distributed fe@xmath1 ions increases with the iron precursor flow rate reaching typically the value of 0.1% .",
    "our results imply that the magnitude of the paramagnetic response and , hence , the density of dilute fe cations , does not virtually depend on the growth temperature .",
    "however , the incorporation of fe can be enlarged by co - doping with si donors , shifting the solubility limit to higher fe concentrations.@xcite    the presence of ferromagnetic - like features can be consistently interpreted in terms of crystallographic and/or chemical phase separations into nanoscale regions containing a large density of the magnetic constituent .",
    "our extensive squid , sxrd , tem , exafs , and xanes measurements of movpe - grown ( ga , fe)n indicate that at the lowest growth temperature @xmath57c , a large majority of the fe ions occupy random ga - substitutional positions .",
    "however , in films grown at higher temperatures , @xmath58c , a considerable variety of fe - rich nanocrystals is formed , differing in the fe to n ratio . in samples deposited at the low end of the @xmath0 range ,",
    "we observe mostly @xmath3fe@xmath4n precipitates but also inclusions of elemental @xmath7- and @xmath8-fe as well as of @xmath5-fe@xmath6n . in all these materials @xmath24",
    "is well above rt , so that the presence of the corresponding nanocrystals explains the robust superparamagnetic behavior of ( ga , fe)n grown at @xmath59c .    with the increase of the growth temperature nanocrystals of @xmath11-fe@xmath12n form and owing to antiferromagnetic interactions specific to this compound",
    ", the magnetization acquires a component linear in the magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic response has been previously observed and assigned to the van vleck paramagnetism of isolated fe@xmath60 ions . in view of the present findings",
    ", however , its interpretation in terms of antiferromagnetically coupled spins in nitrogen rich fe@xmath9n ( @xmath61 ) nanocrystals seems more grounded .",
    "the total amount of fe ions contributing to the formation of the fe - rich nanocrystals is found to increase with the lowering of the growth rate and/or with the raising of the growth temperature . at the same time",
    ", however , the size of individual nanocrystals appears not to vary with the growth parameters .",
    "furthermore , annealing of ( ga , fe)n containing only diluted fe cations does not result in a crystallographic phase separation .",
    "altogether , our findings indicate that the aggregation of fe ions occurs by nucleation at the growth front and is kinetically limited . moreover , according to the tem results presented here , the spatial distribution of nanocrystals is highly non - random .",
