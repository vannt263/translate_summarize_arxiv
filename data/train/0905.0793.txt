    "<S> we construct merger trees based on the extended press - schechter theory ( eps ) in order to study the merger rates of dark matter haloes over a range of present day mass ( @xmath0 ) , progenitor mass @xmath1 ) and redshift ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we used the first crossing distribution of a moving barrier of the form @xmath3 , proposed by sheth & tormen , to take into account the ellipsoidal nature of collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean merger rate per halo @xmath4 depends on the halo mass @xmath5 as @xmath6 and on the redshift as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in agreement with the predictions of n - body simulations and this shows the ability of merger - trees based on eps theory to follow with a satisfactory agreement the results of n - body simulations and the evolution of structures in a hierarchical universe .
