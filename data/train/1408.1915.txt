    "[ intro ] heavy quarks ( charm and beauty ) are essential probes of the properties of the medium created in heavy - ion collisions , since they are produced in the early stage of hadronic collisions via scattering processes with large momentum transfer .",
    "heavy - flavour production has been measured via semi - electronic and semi - muonic decays , as well as fully reconstructed d mesons , in pp , p  pb and pb  pb collisions with alice  @xcite at the lhc . in central pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath1 = 2.76 tev , a strong suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) d mesons and electrons ( muons ) from heavy - flavour hadron decays was observed at mid- ( forward ) rapidity  @xcite .",
    "this suppression is interpreted as an effect of parton energy loss in the medium created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , a quantitative understanding of the pb - pb results requires cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects to be taken into account , which can be accessed by studying p  pb collisions  @xcite assuming that a hot and dense extended system is not formed in such collisions .",
    "cnm effects are studied using the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 , defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average nuclear overlap function estimated through the glauber model , which gives @xmath7  @xcite ; @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the @xmath4-differential yield ( cross section ) in p ",
    "pb collisions and @xmath10 is the @xmath4-differential cross section in pp collisions ; a is the mass number of the pb nucleus .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is unity in absence of nuclear effects .",
    "alice is the dedicated heavy - ion experiment at the lhc .",
    "it allows to investigate heavy - flavour production in several decay channels over a wide rapidity and transverse momentum range .",
    "the alice detector consists of a set of central barrel detectors ( @xmath11 ) , a muon spectrometer ( @xmath12 ) and global detectors for triggering and event characterization purposes . at mid - rapidity ,",
    "the inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) provide track reconstruction down to very low transverse momentum ( @xmath13100 mev/@xmath3 ) with a momentum resolution better than 4@xmath14 for @xmath15 gev/@xmath3 , as well as good impact parameter ( distance of closest approach of the track to the primary interaction vertex ) resolution  @xcite .",
    "d mesons are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels and electrons from semileptonic decays of charm and@xmath16or beauty hadrons are measured . at forward rapidity , muons from heavy - flavour hadron decays can be measured , since the alice muon spectrometer allows to identify muons by requiring that a track reconstructed in the tracking system is matched with the corresponding track candidate in the muon trigger system .",
    "d mesons are reconstructed from their hadronic decay channels @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 ( br = 3.88@xmath14 ) , @xmath20 @xmath18 @xmath21 ( br = 9.13@xmath14 ) , @xmath22 @xmath18 @xmath23 @xmath18 @xmath21 ( br = 67.7@xmath14 ) and @xmath24 @xmath18 @xmath25 @xmath18 @xmath26 ( br = 2.28@xmath14 ) . the selection of d meson candidates against the large combinatorial background is based on the reconstruction of decay vertices displaced by a few hundred @xmath27 from the interaction vertex , exploiting the @xmath28 of @xmath17 , @xmath20 and @xmath24 , which is about @xmath29 depending on the d - meson species . in order to further enhance the ratio between the d - meson signal and the combinatorial background , the measurements of the particle time - of - flight from the collision point to the time of flight ( tof ) detector and of the specific energy loss in the tpc gas are used to identify @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the measurement is performed in the rapidity interval @xmath32 ( which is specific for p - pb collisions ) over a wide transverse momentum range .",
    "the electrons are identified with tpc and tof at low @xmath4 , as well as the tpc and electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) at high @xmath4 .",
    "the measurement of electrons from heavy - flavour hadron decays at mid - rapidity ( @xmath33 ) requires the subtraction of contributions from several background sources from the inclusive electron distribution .",
    "the dominant contribution is from photon conversions in the detector material and dalitz decays of light neutral mesons ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 , mainly ) .",
    "these contributions are statistically subtracted by using the cocktail ( i.e. a calculation of the background based mainly on measured @xmath4-differential cross sections of the main electron sources ) and invariant mass ( i.e. the measurement of electrons from photon conversions and dalitz decays via low - mass electron - positron pairs ) methods  @xcite . with the high spatial resolution of the track impact parameter measurement",
    ", one can isolate the beauty - decay contribution thanks to the much larger lifetime of beauty hadrons ( @xmath36 ) compared to that of charm hadrons and other background sources .",
    "the electrons from their semileptonic decays have , consequently , a larger average impact parameter with respect to the primary interaction vertex .",
    "muons from heavy - flavour hadron decays have been measured at forward ( i.e. proton - beam direction , @xmath37 ) and backward ( i.e. pb - beam direction , @xmath38 ) rapidity , respectively , by analyzing data collected with different beam configurations .",
    "the main source of background in the @xmath4-differential inclusive spectrum consists of muons from light hadron decays ( @xmath31 and @xmath30 , mainly ) .",

    "is estimated via monte - carlo simulations , as well as with a data - driven method based on the extrapolation of charged hadron yields  @xcite measured at mid - rapidity with alice to forward rapidity .",

    "the @xmath0 can be described by means of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd  @xcite calculations , including the eps09  @xcite nuclear modification of the cteq6 m  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and calculations based on the color glass condensate ( cgc  @xcite ) initial - state prescription .",
