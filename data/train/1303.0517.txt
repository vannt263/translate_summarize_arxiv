    "in addition , the behavior close the physical point is intensely influenced by the chiral logarithm term , so an extraction of the @xmath1 scattering lengths without a long extrapolation is still highly needed to guarantee the convergence of the chiral expansion .",
    "fortunately , the milc collaboration has generated enough lattice ensembles whose goldstone pion masses are smaller than or close to @xmath2  mev  @xcite ( e.g. , the fine @xmath160 ensemble , whose goldstone pion mass is about @xmath161  mev ) .",
    "furthermore , as we explained early , the nnlo @xmath11pt will be the proper physical functional form to fit the lattice data ( at least four data point ) of the @xmath4 @xmath1 scattering length and it needs more lattice data near the physical point .",
    "i have an impetus to do these works .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this work since this will need an astronomical amount of computing allocations .",
    "we will enthusiastically appeal for all the possible computational resources to accomplish this peculiar and challenging task .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath4 channel is challenging and stimulating phenomenologically due to the existence of the @xmath162 resonance . in the work",
    ", we have exhibited that the @xmath1 scattering for the @xmath4 channel can be reliably calculated by the moving wall sources without gauge fixing  @xcite .",
    "it gives us an anticipation that this technique can be successfully exploited to study the @xmath162 resonance . in our previous work  @xcite , we have evaluated the @xmath162 mass from lattice qcd , and found that the decay @xmath163 is allowed kinematically only for enough small @xmath121 quark mass .",
    "this work and our lattice calculation for the @xmath1 scattering lengths delivered in this paper will encourage the researchers to study the @xmath162 resonance .",
    "we have been investigating the @xmath162 resonance parameters with the isospin representation of @xmath164 , and the preliminary lattice results are already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    additionally , for @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath154 channel",
    ", we realize an important issue that the presence of @xmath162 resonance is possible in the low - energy , and thus it should be necessary for us to employ the variational method  @xcite to secure the rigorous scattering length as investigated in the @xmath165 scattering in the @xmath166 channel in refs .  @xcite .",
    "since we only make use of the relative small quark masses to study the @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath4 channel , we can temporarily and reasonably overlook this contamination in the present study as already explained in ref .",
    "however , we should bear in mind that this issue should be settled in the more sophisticated lattice examination .",
    "it will be very interesting to systematically study this pollution for the @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath4 channel .    admittedly , due to the intense theoretical and experimental efforts put into the scalar - isoscalar and scalar - isovector sector of the meson - meson scattering recently , studying the @xmath167 scattering length on the lattice is gradually becoming a very interesting enterprise . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the robust calculation of the @xmath1 scattering lengths ( in particular for the @xmath4 channel ) will naturally encourage us to study other challenging systems like @xmath167 , etc . physically , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , studying @xmath167 is very important , and the calculation of the @xmath0-wave @xmath167 scattering length in the @xmath4 channel is a genuine two coupled - channel problem  @xcite , where the system can be approximately described by only @xmath1 and @xmath63 two channels ( we refer to @xmath1 as channel @xmath64 and @xmath167 channel @xmath5 ) , then the @xmath168-matrix is a @xmath169 unitary matrix which contains @xmath129 real parameters  @xcite ( the @xmath0-wave @xmath167 scattering in the @xmath170 channel can be treated analogously  @xcite , and the lattice study of @xmath171 scattering is then highly desirable . ) .",
    "therefore , it is absolutely necessary to incorporate the @xmath0-wave @xmath172-channel for a physical calculation of the @xmath0-wave @xmath167 scattering length in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the generalized lscher s formula in this case gives a relation among these three parameters , all of which are functions of the energy  @xcite .",
    "since some of these parameters are still poorly measured in the present experiments , the lattice calculation is valuable and highly desirable . with our lattice efforts on channel @xmath5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , at present , if we can compute the @xmath0-wave @xmath173 scattering in the @xmath4 channel , in principle , we can solve this problem .",
    "we are launching a series of lattice studies for these aims .",
