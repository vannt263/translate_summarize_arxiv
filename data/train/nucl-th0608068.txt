    "the theory of nuclear forces has a long history ( cf .  table  1 ) .",
    "based upon the seminal idea by * hideki yukawa *  @xcite , first field - theoretic attempts to derive the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction focused on pion - exchange . while the one - pion exchange turned out to be very useful in explaining nn scattering data and the properties of the deuteron  @xcite , multi - pion exchange was beset with serious ambiguities  @xcite .",
    "thus , the `` pion theories '' of the 1950s are generally judged as failures  for reasons we understand today : pion dynamics is constrained by chiral symmetry , a crucial point that was unknown in the 1950s .",
    "historically , the experimental discovery of heavy mesons  @xcite in the early 1960s saved the situation .",
    "the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model  @xcite emerged which is still the most economical and quantitative phenomenology for describing the nuclear force  @xcite . the weak point of this model ,",
    "however , is the scalar - isoscalar `` sigma '' or `` epsilon '' boson , for which the empirical evidence remains controversial . since this boson is associated with the correlated ( or resonant ) exchange of two pions , a vast theoretical effort that occupied more than a decade was launched to derive the 2@xmath0-exchange contribution of the nuclear force , which creates the intermediate range attraction . for this , dispersion theory as well as field theory were invoked producing the paris  @xcite and the bonn  @xcite potentials .",
    "the nuclear force problem appeared to be solved ; however , with the discovery of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , all `` meson theories '' were relegated to models and the attempts to derive the nuclear force started all over again .",
    "the problem with a derivation from qcd is that this theory is non - perturbative in the low - energy regime characteristic of nuclear physics , which makes direct solutions impossible .",
    "therefore , during the first round of new attempts , qcd - inspired quark models  @xcite became popular .",
    "these models were able to reproduce qualitatively some of the gross features of the nuclear force .",
    "however , on a critical note , it has been pointed out that these quark - based approaches were nothing but another set of models and , thus , did not represent any fundamental progress .",
    "equally well , one may then stay with the simpler and much more quantitative meson models .",
    "a major breakthrough occurred when the concept of an effective field theory ( eft ) was introduced and applied to low - energy qcd .",
    "as outlined by weinberg in a seminal paper  @xcite , one has to write down the most general lagrangian consistent with the assumed symmetry principles , particularly the ( broken ) chiral symmetry of qcd . at low energy ,",
    "the effective degrees of freedom are pions and nucleons rather than quarks and gluons ; heavy mesons and nucleon resonances are `` integrated out '' .",
    "so , the circle of history is closing and we are _ back to yukawa s meson theory _ , except that we have learned to add one important refinement to the theory : broken chiral symmetry is a crucial constraint that generates and controls the dynamics and establishes a clear connection with the underlying theory , qcd .",
    "it is the purpose of the remainder of this paper to describe the eft approach to nuclear forces in more detail .",

    "the chiral effective lagrangian is given by an infinite series of terms with increasing number of derivatives and/or nucleon fields , with the dependence of each term on the pion field prescribed by the rules of broken chiral symmetry .",
    "applying this lagrangian to nn scattering generates an unlimited number of feynman diagrams .",
    "however , weinberg showed  @xcite that a systematic expansion exists in terms of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes a momentum or pion mass , @xmath8 gev is the chiral symmetry breaking scale , and @xmath9 ( cf .  figure  1 ) .",
    "this has become known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10pt ) . for a given order @xmath11 , the number of terms is finite and calculable ; these terms are uniquely defined and the prediction at each order is model - independent . by going to higher orders",
    ", the amplitude can be calculated to any desired accuracy .",
    "solid lines represent nucleons and dashed lines pions .",
    "further explanations are given in the text . ]    following the first initiative by weinberg @xcite , pioneering work was performed by ordez , ray , and van kolck @xcite who constructed a nn potential in coordinate space based upon @xmath10pt at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ; @xmath12 ) .",
    "the results were encouraging and many researchers became attracted to the new field .",
    "kaiser , brockmann , and weise  @xcite presented the first model - independent prediction for the nn amplitudes of peripheral partial waves at nnlo .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite developed the first momentum - space nn potential at nnlo , and entem and machleidt  @xcite presented the first potential at n@xmath13lo ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "in @xmath10pt , the nn amplitude is uniquely determined by two classes of contributions : contact terms and pion - exchange diagrams .",
    "there are two contacts of order @xmath15 [ @xmath16 represented by the four - nucleon graph with a small - dot vertex shown in the first row of figure  1 .",
    "the corresponding graph in the second row , four nucleon legs and a solid square , represent the seven contact terms of @xmath17 . finally , at @xmath18",
    ", we have 15 contact contributions represented by a four - nucleon graph with a solid diamond .",
    "now , turning to the pion contributions : at leading order [ lo , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , there is only the wellknown static one - pion exchange , second diagram in the first row of figure  1 .",
    "two - pion exchange ( tpe ) starts at next - to - leading order ( nlo , @xmath21 ) and all diagrams of this leading - order two - pion exchange are shown .",
    "further tpe contributions occur in any higher order . of this sub - leading tpe",
    ", we show only two representative diagrams at nnlo and three diagrams at n@xmath13lo .",
    "while tpe at nnlo was known for a while  @xcite , tpe at n@xmath13lo has been calculated only recently by kaiser  @xcite .",
    "all @xmath5 exchange diagrams / contributions up to n@xmath13lo are summarized in a pedagogical and systematic fashion in ref .",
    "@xcite where the model - independent results for nn scattering in peripheral partial waves are also shown .",
    "finally , there is also three - pion exchange , which shows up for the first time at n@xmath13lo ( two loops ; one representative @xmath22 diagram is included in figure  1 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that the 3@xmath0 contribution at this order is negligible .",
    "one important advantage of @xmath10pt is that it makes specific predictions also for many - body forces . for a given order of @xmath10pt , 2nf , 3nf ,",
    " are generated on the same footing ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) . at lo , there are no 3nf , and at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , all 3nf terms cancel  @xcite .",
    "however , at nnlo and higher orders , well - defined , nonvanishing 3nf occur  @xcite . since 3nf show up for the first time at nnlo , they are weak . four - nucleon forces ( 4nf ) occur first at n@xmath13lo and , therefore , they are even weaker .",
    "the two - nucleon system is non - perturbative as evidenced by the presence of shallow bound states and large scattering lengths .",
    "weinberg  @xcite showed that the strong enhancement of the scattering amplitude arises from purely nucleonic intermediate states .",
    "he therefore suggested to use perturbation theory to calculate the nn potential and to apply this potential in a scattering equation ( lippmann - schwinger or schrdinger equation ) to obtain the nn amplitude .",
    "we follow this philosophy .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is a low - momentum expansion .",
    "it is valid only for momenta @xmath23 gev .",
    "therefore , when a potential is constructed , all expressions ( contacts and irreducible pion exchanges ) are multiplied with a regulator function , @xmath24 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote , respectively , the magnitudes of the initial and final nucleon momenta in the center - of - mass frame ; and @xmath27 .",
    "the exponent @xmath28 is to be chosen such that the regulator generates powers which are beyond the order at which the calculation is conducted .",
