    "<S> we investigate 4@xmath0 su(2 ) lattice gauge theory with regge  einstein quantum gravity on a dynamically coupled regge skeleton . to overview the phase diagram </S>",

    "<S> evidence for an entropy  dominated disordered , an entropy  dominated ordered and an ill  defined region is presented .    </S>",
    "<S> = -.5truein = -.25truein    in recent years various exploratory simulations of pure 4@xmath0 quantum gravity have been carried out , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for recent overviews . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one of the authors reported numerical evidence for an `` entropy  dominated '' phase , where the partition function is well  defined , although the regge - einstein action is unbounded . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , these results were confirmed by beirl et al.,@xcite , where also some universality under changes of the measure was reported . </S>",
    "<S> the question of possible physical relevance of the entropy - dominated phase was first addressed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and it was suggested to show that the entropy  dominated phase can accommodate hadronic masses @xmath2 many order of magnitude smaller than the planck mass @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> su(2 ) lattice gauge theory was suggested to represent the matter fields , because it stands out as the simplest 4@xmath0 asymptotically free quantum field theory . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a concise summary , a research program along this line of thought was outlined , and supported by exploratory numerical results from an @xmath1 lattice . for the coupled system </S>",
    "<S> the entropy dominated phase survives , and within it an order  disorder transition could be located . in a continuum or almost continuum </S>",
    "<S> limit , if it exists , the transition will have the usual interpretation of a deconfining phase transition , the ordered phase defines a quark  gluon plasma and in the disordered phase quarks are confined . </S>",
    "<S> to provide modest evidence for a consistent picture , one has to show that @xmath4 can be decreased . </S>",
    "<S> this will require a finite size scaling analysis , and simulations on @xmath5 and larger systems . </S>",
    "<S> they are out of reach for present medium  </S>",
    "<S> sized computer systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a study of the phase diagram in the ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) plane is feasible . to map out the phase diagram we performed new simulations , which are reported in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> let us recall euclidean quantum gravity on a regge skeleton . the regge  </S>",
    "<S> einstein action is given by @xmath8 here @xmath3 is the planck mass , the sum is over all triangles ( @xmath9 simplices ) of a 4@xmath0 regge skeleton , @xmath10 denotes the area of the corresponding triangle and @xmath11 its deficit angle . as in previous work </S>",
    "<S> , our regge skeleton will be given by the standard tesselation of the hypercubical 4@xmath0 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it is well  known that the regge  </S>",
    "<S> einstein action is unbounded . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the theory could exist due to entropy effects . for volume @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> numerical evidence was reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an entropy  dominated region , such that the partition function @xmath13 exists for @xmath14 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 limits the well  defined region . as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we use the expectation value @xmath16 , the average volume of a 4-simplex , to define our length unit as @xmath17 . then @xmath18 is found . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth , all quantities will be expressed in units of @xmath19 , which will not be explicitly written down anymore . in a fundamental length scenario@xcite </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 stays finite in physical units ( for instance fermi ) , whereas @xmath20 for a continuum theory . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental length theory is attractive under the assumption that it will define a `` natural '' regularization scheme , such that no renormalization occurs when physical quantities are calculated in this scheme . if this is not the case , the continuum scenario is preferred , as it offers the possibility that ( after renormalization ) physical results will not depend on microscopic details of the regularization , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ be universal in the usual sense of lattice gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> these two scenarios are presumably indistinguishable in present day numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> classically our condition @xmath12 corresponds to a cosmological constant @xmath21 this is seen by applying the variational principle to @xmath22 and comparing the result with the one obtained from @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( 3 ) is consistent with the observed value @xmath24 , and this would survive quantization if renormalization is not necessary .    </S>",
    "<S> our complete action is @xmath25 where @xmath26 . \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the ordered product of su(2 ) matrices attached to the links of triangle @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> coupling of the gauge and the gravity part is entirely achieved through the dynamical weight factors @xmath29 . to obtain the correct classical limit </S>",
    "<S> , the weight factors @xmath29 have to fulfill the constraint@xcite @xmath30 which should be supplemented by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath31 these conditions leave ample freedom for choice , and in the following we use the barycentric implementation.@xcite at @xmath32 this system was investigated for various @xmath7 values . </S>",
    "<S> this is a data point well inside the entropy  dominated region . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we report additional results at @xmath33 , 0.015 , 0.020 , 0.025 and 0.0375 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider @xmath33 , 0.015 and 0.020 . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence for the disorder  </S>",
    "<S> order phase transition at all of these planck masses and polyakov loop histograms for some relevant @xmath7 values are shown in figures 1 , 2 and 3 . as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite 20,000 thermalization sweeps were performed before measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent statistics for each histogram is @xmath7 dependent and lies in the range 20,00060,000 sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> more complete numerical results and additional data points are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a three - peak structure is sometimes observed when both confined and deconfined phases coexist , for example in figure  1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is suggestive of a first order transition in the vicinity of the coupling . to substantiate this conjecture , would require finite size scaling investigations ( see for instance ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) on @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ... systems , and has to be postponed until more powerful computational facilities are readily available . as function of @xmath36 the region of @xmath7 around which the transition occurs does not vary much . </S>",
    "<S> tentatively , we identify it to be between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    the next step is to proceed towards higher planck masses . at a high enough value of the planck mass one </S>",
    "<S> does expect that the system will find itself in unstable states , similar as in the pure gravity case@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , suggestions to that effect begin to appear at @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  4 shows the time history of the gravity action @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> a two - peak structure , seen usually in first - order phase transitions , develops . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is unclear whether one can characterize the behavior as such because , as in the pure gravity case , the partition function likely ceases to exist when one is outside the entropy - dominated region . in any case </S>",
    "<S> the two peak structure characterizes competing effects of the entropy versus the unboundedness of the regge - einstein action .    at planck mass </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 we seem to have reached the region where entropy effects from the measure begin to lose control over the unboundedness of the action . in figure  6 </S>",
    "<S> we present the time history of the gravity action at an even higher planck mass @xmath43 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> it is constantly on the rise and the system is clearly unstable .    </S>",
    "<S> the ( @xmath44 ) phase diagram is summarized in figure  6 . </S>",
    "<S> regions a and c constitute the entropy - dominated region which is estimated to be @xmath45 , possibly up to @xmath46 . in region </S>",
    "<S> b the partition function ceases to exist and is assumed to be meaningless . </S>",
    "<S> region c is the ordered phase where , in the infinite volume limit , polyakov loops assume non - zero expectation values and region a is the disordered phase where the expectation value of the polyakov loops are zero . in the present paper the hadronic mass ( in our unit @xmath47 ) is given by the `` deconfining '' temperature @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the expectation value of the link length in the short ( @xmath50 ) direction of the hypercubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> fairly independent of @xmath3 this value stays around @xmath51.@xcite assuming @xmath52 , one obtains then @xmath53 for the @xmath1 lattice . with </S>",
    "<S> increased computational power one may first envision a finite size scaling analysis of @xmath54 systems towards @xmath55 , to confirm and significantly improve the accuracy of the phase diagram of figure  6 . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , one should study an @xmath5 lattice on the present heuristic level , to obtain evidence that the ratio @xmath56 can indeed be increased ( naively by a factor of two ) . </S>"
