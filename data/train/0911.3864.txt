    "many researchers during the last decade have enthusiastically investigated the structure of real networks that have emerged from various disciplines , such as information science , sociology , and biology . as a result of these investigations ,",
    "some have found two features inherent in their networks , i.e. , _ small - world _",
    "@xcite and _ scale - free _",
    "@xcite , which were vastly different from those of the regular and random networks already known .",
    "the term  small - world \" means that the clustering coefficient remains large and that there are very short paths between every two nodes , and  scale - free \" means that the degree distribution has a long tail , which usually obeys a power law .",
    "all networks having both ( or either ) of these are often called complex networks .",
    "many physicists have tried to theoretically understand their features by using mathematical models .",
    "the threshold network model is a non - growing network model that explains the properties of complex networks .",
    "each node in this model has an intrinsic weight that is randomly distributed according to a certain probability distribution function .",
    "every pair of nodes satisfying the condition that the sum of their weights is over a certain given threshold is linked . when the weights are generated from various types of restricted distribution ( specifically , exponential or power - law type distributions )",
    ", both the degrees of nodes and the degree - wise clustering coefficient obey universal power laws at the high tails of the degrees @xcite .",
    "we investigated the scale - free feature for both the degrees and clustering coefficient in a wider variety of weight distribution functions using extreme value theory@xcite .",
    "extreme value theory provides an explanation of the distribution of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables within a sufficiently high range . according to this theory ,",
    "the distribution is universally expressed with a generalized pareto distribution ( gpd ) .",
    "this gives the expression of a generic weight distribution function , which finally results in universal power laws , which is the main contribution of this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly explain the threshold network model in sec .",

    "first , we will explain the threshold network model @xcite with @xmath0 nodes .",
    "we assign a weight , @xmath1 , to each node by using an iid random variable from a certain weight distribution function , @xmath2 . when the sum of two weights @xmath3  ( @xmath4 ) in every pair of nodes is more than or equal to a given threshold , @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 an edge is formed between them .",

    "nodes with the same weight values have an equal number of degrees , and the degrees of nodes monotonically increase as their weight values increase .",
    "due to these features , the degree of the threshold model is specifically described in the continuous limit of @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",

    "next , let us review the essence of extreme value theory .",
    "this theory mathematically treats the statistical behavior of the _ maximum _ @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is an ensemble of iid random variables given by a common distribution function , @xmath20 . in a linearly renormalized maximum",

    "( [ eq : w_conditions ] ) unbroken , threshold @xmath5 must satisfy @xmath66 , where @xmath34 is sufficiently large .",
    "this indicates that we have to implicitly assume a high threshold to universally observe the power laws .",
    "we next calculate the clustering coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cluster_coeff ] ) with the generic weight function in eq .",

    "( [ eq : corr_range_k ] ) , and therefore the integral can successfully be calculated without violating the requirements of extreme value theory .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evt_fx ] ) and  ( [ eq : f_inv ] ) , it follows that @xmath68 where @xmath69 therefore , the clustering coefficient is given by @xmath70 for large @xmath11 , where @xmath13 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_k_ngtm_exact ] ) . when @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fd ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) can be explicitly calculated as @xmath71 when @xmath28 , therefore , @xmath72 to sum up , the clustering coefficient also obeys a universal power law expressed by @xmath73    finally , we should mention @xmath74 is always satisfied in the range of degree @xmath75 or equivalently when the weight @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 , it immediately follows that @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , @xmath79 these results mean that @xmath74 for @xmath80 , and more importantly , the range of the clustering coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : powerlaw2a ] ) and  ( [ eq : powerlaw2b ] ) is modified by @xmath81 as well as the case of the degree distribution , the applicable range of the clustering coefficients is also scaled with the number of nodes , @xmath8 .",
    "this section presents numerical results for the distributions of degrees and clustering coefficients to compare them with the theoretical results obtained in the previous section . to observe power laws",
    ", we must select the values of parameters @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath34 optimally with the next two items in mind .",
    "first , @xmath5 and @xmath34 are satisfied by the implicit condition , @xmath78 , that prevents the applicable ranges in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : corr_range_k ] ) and  ( [ eq : true_ck_range ] ) from diminishing .",
    "second , as the ranges increase as @xmath8 and @xmath82 increase , we need to give them as numerically large values as possible to identify the theoretical curves in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_k_ngtm_exact ] ) , ( [ eq : pk_xi_zero ] ) , ( [ eq : ck_integral_form ] ) , and ( [ eq : ck_xi_zero ] ) clearly in the corresponding ranges .",
    "we determine the three parameters @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath34 using the following procedures . from the shape of the weight distribution function , appropriate @xmath34 and @xmath83",
    "are calculated using the fextremes package @xcite in r language @xcite .",
    "when the value of @xmath34 is fixed , we give a large @xmath5 while retaining the condition @xmath78 and gradually increase @xmath8 until the universal power laws can be observed widely as well .",
    "typical results where the weights are given by the normal and the lognormal distributions ( @xmath84 ) , the standard frchet distribution ( @xmath85 ) , and the uniform distribution ( @xmath86 ) are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : degree_dist ] and  [ fig : clustering_coeff_dist ] .",
    "as can be seen from these figures , the theoretically predicted curves nicely fit the numerical results , meaning eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_k_ngtm_exact ] ) ,  ( [ eq : pk_xi_zero ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ck_integral_form ] ) , and  ( [ eq : ck_xi_zero ] ) are all accurate .",
    "each line of power law @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 in the figure indicates the universal power law in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : power - law1a ] ) ,  ( [ eq : power - law1b ] ) ,  ( [ eq : powerlaw2a ] ) , and  ( [ eq : powerlaw2b ] ) .",
    "these lines are also extremely consistent with the numerical results .",
    "the plots of the numerical results around the lower bounds of the ranges appear to deviate from being linear , i.e. , the power laws , because the original formulas for the degree distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_k_ngtm_exact ] ) and the clustering coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ck_integral_form ] ) are only valid in large - degree regions .",
    "therefore , all the deviations result from small - degree effects .    consequently , we evaluated the theoretical predictions in sec .",
    "[ sec : main_result ] and found they were in good agreement with the results obtained from numerical experiments in both the distributions of degrees and clustering coefficients .",
    "we analyzed the threshold network model based on extreme value theory . where the number of nodes , @xmath8 , and threshold @xmath5 were sufficiently large",
    ", the weight distribution function , @xmath91 , could be assumed to belong to a family of the generic weight function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evt_fx ] ) for @xmath92 as long as the limit distribution of maximum values for @xmath91 converged to the distribution of gevs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gev_fam_dist ] ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , many important weight functions are classified into this family ; therefore , we could comprehensively treat the model with various weight functions .",
    "we then calculated the exact forms of the distributions of degrees and clustering coefficients by applying the generic weight function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evt_fx ] ) . as a result",
    ", we found theoretical evidence for the universal power laws in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : corr_range_k ] ) and  ( [ eq : true_ck_range ] ) , which was extremely consistent with the results obtained by masuda _ et al .",
    "we also demonstrated that even though the theoretical prediction assumed a sufficiently large number of nodes , @xmath8 , threshold value , @xmath5 , and degree , @xmath11 , the theoretical results could be reproduced through numerical experiments .",
    "this fact could explain that real complex networks with a large number of nodes and a high threshold ( if they exist ) could universally appear with scale - free properties .",
    "we conclude by referring to recent mathematical studies on threshold network models @xcite .",
    "we think that our investigation was important as a prototype to apply extreme value theory to various other models of complex networks . in future work",
