    "the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) of ferromagnetic tunnel junctions ( ftjs ) has attracted much interest due to its potentials for technological applications .",
    "@xcite to realize the high mr ratio and low resistance required for technological applications , more information on the electronic states and tunneling process in ftjs is needed . thus far , a simple julliere s model@xcite for the tmr ratio , given as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spin polarization of the left(right)-hand side ferromagnetic leads , has frequently been used to analyze the tmr ratio .",
    "although this expression well accounts for the experimental results of the tmr ratio once we adopt the values of the spin polarization @xmath4 observed , the meaning of @xmath4 is not sufficiently clear . in order to clarify the relation between the realistic electronic state and the tmr ratio , first principles and realistic tight - binding calculations have been performed to give higher tmr ratios than those observed .",
    "@xcite also , as a result of the roughness of the amorphous - like barrier , the effects of resonant tunneling , @xcite scattering by disorder , and spin - flip tunneling due to magnetic impurities have been intensively studied .",
    "@xcite    in spite of these intensive theoretical studies , the role of the interface is not yet completely understood .",
    "recent experiments , however , have indicated the importance of the interfacial electronic states : moodera @xmath5 @xcite showed that a formation of quantum well states at the interface by cu spacer decreased the tmr ratio in a oscillatory way .",
    "teresa @xmath5 @xcite showed that the sign of @xmath4 depends on the combination of the atomic species of the ferromagnetic leads and the barrier materials .",
    "leclair @xmath5 @xcite demonstrated that the cr - dusted interface strongly reduced the tmr ratio of co / al - o / co ftjs , whereas the cu - dusted interface showed a much smaller effect , suggesting a close relationship between the electronic density of states at interfaces and the tmr ratio of ftjs .",
    "as for the decay of the tmr ratio due to the quantum well state , zhang and levy @xcite proposed that a loss of the coherence due to non - ideal structure of the inserted spacer may give rise to an exponentical decay of the tmr ratio as a function of spacer thickness .",
    "the difference between cr and cu spacers , however , appears even for 0.1 nm thickness of the spacer , which may indicate that a disorderd configuration of atoms at the interface must be properly taken into consideration .    in this paper , we focus our attention on electronic states of the magnetic impurities at the interfaces , which have partly been argued by leclair @xmath5 , @xcite and will show that the observed phenomena for cr - dusted ftjs can be explained by the concept that the @xmath1-electron tunneling , which is dominant in the tunneling process , is strongly affected by changes induced by magnetic impurities in the electronic states at the interfaces . below we adopt the periodic anderson hamiltonian to model the impurity - doped co / al - o / co type ftjs , calculate the tunnel conductance and tmr ratio by using the kubo formula , and show that the tmr ratio of ftjs made of co or permalloy is actually sensitive to the majority spin electronic states induced by magnetic impurities at interfaces .",
    "strong reduction in the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) or inverse gmr induced by magnetic impurities in metallic multilayers has already been reported .",
    "@xcite such reduction in gmr ratios has been interpreted in terms of the change in the spin asymmetry parameter .",
    "@xcite we calculate the effects of magnetic impurities on the gmr ratio in a generalized periodic anderson model ( @xmath6 model ) , then compare the effects of magnetic impurities between tmr and gmr .",
    "in order to describe tmr and the electronic states of magnetic impurities in the interfacial co layers in co / al - o / co type ftjs , we must take into account the following two aspects .",
    "first , the positive spin polarization of the tunnel current and the reasonably large tmr ratio of co / al - o / co type ftjs must be properly reproduced in the model .",
    "the simplest way to satisfy these conditions is to use @xmath1-electron tunneling that is spin - polarized by spin - dependent @xmath6 mixing .",
    "second , it is well known that transition metal impurities such as cr and v in co metal have magnetic moments antiparallel to the co moment , and form the so - called virtual bound state ( vbs ) in the majority spin state of co. @xcite because the formation of vbs results from the mixing of the impurity @xmath0-level with the @xmath1-band of co metal , we inevitably include the @xmath1-band in the model as well as the @xmath0-band in order to describe the ferromagnetism of co leads .",
    "thus , the periodic anderson model can include the basic features necessary to elucidate the electronic states and the characteristics of tmr .",
    "the hamiltonian of the periodic anderson model is given by @xmath7 @xmath8 is the hamiltonian for conduction electrons in a tight - binding version given as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "hopping integral for @xmath1-electrons being independent of materials , @xmath11 is the energy level of the @xmath1-electrons , and @xmath12 indicates the spin ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) .",
    "the second term of eq.(2 ) indicates the @xmath0-levels , and is given as @xmath15 the last term indicates the @xmath6 mixing , as @xmath16 we neglect @xmath17 hopping because the tunneling is dominated by @xmath18 hopping , and assume that , by taking @xmath19 in the barrier region , only @xmath1-electrons tunnel through the barrier . because we deal with transition metal impurities , @xmath20 represents both the @xmath0-levels @xmath21 of the ferromagnetic leads and those of the impurities @xmath22 introduced at the interface .",
    "the tunnel conductance at the zero - bias limit is calculated in numerical simulations using the kubo formula .",
    "@xcite we adopt a simple cubic structure for a finite - sized system ; the cross section of the system includes @xmath23 sites and the barrier thickness is 4 in units of the lattice constant @xmath24 .",
    "thereafter , the parameter values are taken in units of @xmath10 , such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the barrier potential is taken to be 9.0 . as can be seen later",
    ", a rather large value of @xmath29 is required to obtain an appreciable tmr ratio by the @xmath6 mixing .",
    "we first calculate the tunnel conductance without impurities , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , in parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) alignment of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic leads , respectively .",
    "the tmr ratio is defined as @xmath32 figure 1 shows the calculated results of tunnel conductance as a function of the fermi energy @xmath33 .     for parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) alignment of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic leads .",
    "inset : tmr ratio calculated from the tunnel conductance as a function of @xmath33 . ]    as a result of the hybridization gap , @xmath30 is zero between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath13 spin channel , and between @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath14 spin channel .",
    "consequently , @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the inset of the figure shows the results of the tmr ratio as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the high tmr ratio below @xmath40 is due to opening of the hybridization gap , but there is no current in ap alignment in this energy region . above @xmath41 , there is almost no tmr effect , because the current is carried by spin - unpolarized @xmath1-electrons .",
    "the physically meaningful values of the tmr ratio appear in a rather narrow range of energy , @xmath42 where the @xmath1-electrons of the minority spin states carry less current than the majority @xmath1-electrons due to the stronger @xmath6 mixing at @xmath33 .",
    "because the range in which a meaningful tmr ratio appears becomes narrower with decreasing @xmath29 , we take @xmath43 with a rather large value of @xmath44 hereafter , which brings about an @xmath45 of @xmath46 , which is not unreasonable when compared with the experimental values .",
    "now we introduce impurities into a ferromagnetic metal - layer adjacent to the insulating barrier . because the transition metal impurities of the cr type in which we are interested may form magnetic moments antiparallel to the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic leads made , for example , of co",
    ", there is a relation such that @xmath47 . because of the relation , the up spin state of the impurities forms vbs , while the down spin state is almost occupied .",
    "therefore , in order to realize the situation , we take @xmath48 , which is slightly below @xmath27 , and treat @xmath49 as a variable parameter . in order to gain insight into the electronic state of the impurity , we calculated the density of states ( dos ) of a single impurity on the metallic surface , which value is a reasonable approximation of the impurity dos at the interface of ftjs .",
    "we show in the inset of fig .",
    "2 the dependence of the number of @xmath13 spin electron @xmath50 of the impurity as a function of @xmath49 .     for @xmath43 with @xmath51 .",
    "inset : the number of up spin electrons @xmath50 ( solid curve ) and @xmath1-component of the density of states ( broken curve ) of a single impurity on a ferromagnetic surface as a function of @xmath49 . ]    with increasing @xmath49 , @xmath50 decreases , indicating that the spin polarization of the impurity becomes negative for larger values of @xmath49 because @xmath52 . because the drop in @xmath50 becomes stronger when @xmath49 approaches @xmath43 , we find that the impurity dos or vbs is located near @xmath33 .",
    "although we did not carry out self - consistent calculations for the impurity state , the magnetic moment of the impurity is about 0.4 per @xmath0-orbital for @xmath53 and @xmath48 , which gives an on - site coulomb interaction of @xmath54 in units of @xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath551ev for 3@xmath0 transition metals when we take @xmath56ev",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the spin polarization of the ferromagnetic leads is rather small ; this is a shortcoming of the present model , which was adopted to reproduce both positive spin polarization and a reasonable tmr ratio .",
    "the tunnel conductance of ftjs including impurities with concentration @xmath57 is calculated by averaging over ten samples for different impurity - configurations .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation of the conductance is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the conductance itself .",
    "figure 2 shows the tunnel conductance @xmath58 in the parallel alignment as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen that the conductance decreases pronouncedly when @xmath49 exceeds @xmath33 .",
    "this is because the @xmath6 mixing decreases the @xmath1-component of the majority spin state near @xmath33 as the vbs approaches @xmath33 , and blocks the @xmath1-electron tunneling . in other words ,",
    "an anti - resonance of the @xmath1-states appears at the interfacial layer where the impurities are introduced .",
    "the broken curve in the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows the @xmath1-component of the dos of an impurity on a surface of an electrode .",
    "it can be seen the anti - resonant state appears when @xmath59 , although the correspondence between the @xmath49-dependences of the dos and @xmath30 is not perfect , probably due to the opening of the hybridization gap in the periodic anderson model .    as a consequence of the reduction in the @xmath13 spin conductance in p alignment",
    ", the tmr ratio dramatically reduces as @xmath49 approaches @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the results for @xmath60 as well as those for @xmath51 are presented .     for @xmath43 .",
    "solid and open circles are the results for @xmath51 and @xmath61 , respectively . ]",
    "the results indicate that the tmr ratio decreases when vbs appears near the fermi level and weakens the @xmath1-electron tunneling .",
    "the reduction of the tmr ratio due to magnetic impurities , however , is quantitatively stronger than the experimental value .",
    "the might be due to the rather strong @xmath6 mixing chosen in this model .",
    "the relative position of vbs of magnetic impurities in transition metals has been intensively studied before ; @xcite vbs for cr impurities is close to the fermi level , whereas that of v impurities is higher than the fermi level . for cu impurities , on the other hand",
    ", @xmath49 may be nearly the same with @xmath26 , and does not form any vbs .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that impurities corresponding to cr and v may bring about dramatic reduction in the tmr ratio whereas cu impurities do not .",
    "the results of both the conductance and tmr ratio are thus in good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "@xcite further , the present model showed no reduction in the conductance of the @xmath13 spin state when magnetic impurities were placed on the co leads several layers apart from the interface .",
    "rather , it slightly increased near @xmath62 .",
    "this result is not inconsistent with the experimental result .",
    "in order to compare the results obtained above with similar effects reported for gmr , we performed simple calculations of gmr in trilayers doped with magnetic impurities near the interface . as a simple model of",
    "co / cu / co type trilayers , we adopted the @xmath6 model , the hamiltonian of which is given by adding the following hamiltonian to eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath63 because @xmath0-electrons may carry the current in this case .",
    "the n.n . hopping integral for @xmath0-electrons",
    "is taken to be @xmath64 . now",
    "the @xmath0-band is broadened by the @xmath0-electron hopping , and we take a smaller value of the @xmath6 mixing ; @xmath65 .    the lattice structure is assumed to be simple cubic , and the thickness of each layer is /6/12/6/ atomic layers in units of the lattice constant .",
    "instead of the site representation used for tmr case , we use a mixed representation @xmath66 to treat the semi - infinite systems where @xmath67 is an index of the atomic layers and @xmath68 is a fourier transform of the sites on each atomic layer .",
    "the green s function @xmath69 with @xmath70 is expressed by a tridiagonal matrix where the diagonal elements consist of @xmath71 matrices of @xmath72 and the off - diagonal elements are alos given by @xmath71 matrices including the hopping integrals of @xmath1- and @xmath0-electrons .",
    "the @xmath0-level @xmath20 depends on the layer , and is expressed as @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( 8) . as in the tmr case , we take @xmath74 and @xmath75 when @xmath67 belongs to the ferromagnetic ( co ) layers , and @xmath76 when @xmath67 belongs to the nonmagnetic ( cu ) layers . because a set of parameter values different from those for the tmr case is used for the gmr case , the position of @xmath33 is different from that taken for the tmr calculation .",
    "to reproduce the gmr effect in our simple model , we introduce the interfacial spin - dependent scattering caused by an intermixing layer at interfaces .",
    "@xcite because the @xmath0-level of the minority spin state of co atoms is above the cu @xmath0-band , co atoms intermixed with a cu layer will form vbs in the minority spin state of the cu @xmath1-band , resulting in spin - dependent scattering to produce the gmr . here , we introduce the following self - energy into the @xmath1-component of the green s function : @xmath77 which represents the effects of co atoms dissolved into the cu layer . here",
    "@xmath78 indicates the concentration of such co atoms and @xmath79 is the broadening of @xmath0-levels due to the @xmath6 mixing , which is taken to be @xmath80 , keeping in mind the width of vbs calculated in the first principles .",
    "@xcite we further take @xmath81 to reproduce the spin - independent resistivity . here , we note that the concentration @xmath78 itself does not have sufficient physical meaning , but @xmath82 controls the magnitude of the self - energy .",
    "the conductivity parallel to the layers can be calculated using the kubo formula without vertex corrections , because there is translational invariance along the planes .",
    "the gmr ratios thus calculated increase with increasing @xmath78 and reach about 60% for @xmath83 .",
    "after successfully reproducing the gmr effect in our simple model , we introduce additional magnetic impurities into the adjacent layers of the intermixed interface . for simplicity",
    ", we use the same expression as that in eq .",
    "( 9 ) for the self - energy for the majority - spin state of the @xmath1-band caused by the additional magnetic impurities , while @xmath78 and @xmath84 are replaced with @xmath57 and @xmath22 , respectively . as in the calculation of tmr",
    ", we take @xmath85 and treat @xmath49 as a variable parameter .",
    "the gmr ratios calculated for @xmath86 with @xmath87 are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( open circles ) as a function of the impurity potential @xmath49 .     for 6/12/6/ and 6/6/6 trilayers , respectively . ]",
    "it can be seen that an inverse gmr can be realized when @xmath88 .",
    "open squares indicate the results for a trilayer with 6/6/6 atomic layers with @xmath89 , and the results show that the qualitative features are not affected by the thickness of the trilayer .",
    "the gmr ratio becomes minimal when @xmath59 , which characteristic is also found in tmr systems .",
    "the reduction , however , may be brought about by an increased scattering of @xmath1-electrons in the majority spin band due to @xmath6 mixing with the impurity states in addition to a reduction in the @xmath1-component of the dos .",
    "the effects of magnetic impurities such as cr and v in the gmr case are almost the same as those obtained in the tmr case , though the origin of the reduction in tmr ratio is due to the blockade of @xmath1-electron tunneling caused by the anti - resonance in the majority spin state of @xmath1-band .",
    "in conclusion , by a qualitative and systematic study of the dependence of the mr ratio on the type of impurities at the interface , we showed that both tmr and gmr ratios are affected strongly when the magnetic impurities form vbs in the majority spin state near the fermi level .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the observed ones .",
    "although the effects of magnetic impurities such as cr and v are quite similar on tmr and grm , the reduction in tmr ratios is due to a blockade of @xmath1-electron tunneling , whereas that in gmr is mainly due to an increase of @xmath1-electron scattering in the majority spin state .",
    "more realistic and self - consistent calculations , however , are desired to obtain a quantitative understanding between the mr ratio and the interfacial electronic states .",
