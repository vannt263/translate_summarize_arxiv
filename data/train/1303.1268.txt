    "the development of coherent electromagnetic sources of higher and higher intensity with increasing photon energy up to the hard x - ray range motivates the theoretical study of the change of the processes of strongly bound systems , such as nuclear processes , by these intense fields ledingham . in this paper , the change of the nuclear photoeffect due to the presence of an intense coherent electromagnetic field is studied .",
    "this process is analogous to the laser - assisted x - ray photo effect ( x - ray absorption ) , a process which was already discussed @xcite in the late 80 s taking into account gauge invariance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the laser - assisted nuclear photoeffect ( lanp ) and the laser - assisted x - ray photo effect ( x - ray absorption ) are laser - assisted bound - free transitions .",
    "the difference between them lies in the charged particle ( proton or electron , respectively ) which takes part in these processes .",
    "although the lanp was recently investigated far from the threshold and neglecting the effect of the coulomb field of the remainder nucleus @xcite , in the case of the laser - assisted x - ray absorption processes it was found that the most interesting changes due to the presence of the laser field appear near the threshold @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , applying the results of @xcite , the lanp is reexamined in a gauge invariant manner and near the threshold , where the hindering effect of the coulomb field of the remainder nucleus is very large so that it must be taken into account .",
    "the effect of the coulomb field of the remainder nucleus on the transition rate is approximately taken into account .",
    "the laser - modified differential cross section is compared to the laser - free differential cross section , and it is shown that their ratio does not depend on nuclear parameters in the two types of initial nuclear states investigated and on the state of polarization of the @xmath0 radiation , but it has only a laser parameter dependence .",
    "the process investigated can be symbolically written as @xmath1where @xmath2 denotes the target nucleus of mass number @xmath3 and of charge number @xmath4 .",
    "the target nucleus absorbs a @xmath0 photon symbolized by @xmath5 , and @xmath6 laser photons take part in the process which is symbolized by @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to @xmath10 laser photon emission and absorption , respectively . as a result , a free proton @xmath11 is emitted and the remainder nucleus is @xmath12 .",
    "the calculation is made in the radiation @xmath13 gauge , and in the long wavelength approximation ( lwa ) of the electromagnetic fields , the recoil of  the remainder nucleus and the initial momentum carried by the laser and @xmath0 fields are neglected . in the case of a circularly polarized monochromatic wave for the vector potential of a laser field ,",

    "it is shown in @xcite that the electromagnetic transition amplitudes of a particle ( proton ) of rest mass @xmath24  and of charge @xmath25 in the presence of a laser field are determined by the matrix elements of the operator @xmath26 with the eigenstates of the instantaneous energy operator @xmath27 in both ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) gauges .",

    "the initial state of the proton has the form @xmath36where @xmath37 is a stationary nuclear state of separation energy @xmath38 of the proton .",

    "the modification of the initial state due to the laser field is neglected since the direct effect of the intense laser field on the nucleus has been found to be negligible @xcite at the laser parameters discussed .",
    "it is also supposed that the initial nucleus does not have an excited state which is resonant or nearly resonant with the applied @xmath0 radiation .",
    "if similarly to @xcite the modification of the final state due to the strong interaction is neglected , then in the final state and in the @xmath29 gauge the instantaneous energy operator @xmath46 reads @xmath47where the superscript @xmath48 refers to the radiation @xmath35 gauge and @xmath49 is the coulomb potential of the remainder nucleus .",

    "2 .    summarizing , one can say that near the threshold , @xmath48 which measures the change of the rate of the lanp , has minor @xmath142 and intensity dependence , and negligible @xmath54 dependence .",
    "furthermore , @xmath175 , which is the rate of change in one channel ( at a definite laser photon number ) , has a significant laser photon number and @xmath64 dependences .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath175 are the same in the cases of the two different initial states considered . since the numerical results obtained seem to be independent of the initial nuclear states chosen , it can be expected that @xmath48 and @xmath175 have a minor dependence from the form of the initial state in general .",
    "regarding the experimental situation at such a high intensity , it is hard to distinguish photo - protons from background protons that arise as a result of interaction with the hot electron plasma created by the intense laser field . we also have to mention that in an experiment the gamma ray pulse from an accelerator must be synchronized with an intense ( e.g. attosecond ) pulse of a laser system .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath119 , which has a short half - life of about @xmath205 @xmath206 , the @xmath119 nuclei must be created in situ in the laser beam by a nuclear reaction .",
    "fortunately , most of the heavier nuclei have protons of @xmath125 shell model state ( the other case investigated ) in their stable ground state . the wispy target determined by the focal spot of the focused intense laser beam ,",
    "the low repetition rate of the laser system , and the angular resolution of the proton detector together make it very challenging to carry out a successful near - threshold , laser - modified proton emission experiment that could produce significant counting statistics ."
