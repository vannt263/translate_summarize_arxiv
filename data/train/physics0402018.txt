    "metamaterials in the form of particulate composite mediums are currently of considerable scientific and technological interest walser . provided that wavelengths are sufficiently long compared with the length scales of inhomogeneities ,",
    "such a metamaterial may be envisaged as a homogenized composite medium ( hcm ) , arising from two homogeneous component mediums l96 , mackay03 .",
    "hcms with especially interesting properties may be conceptualized if the real parts of the relative permittivities ( and/or relative permeabilities ) of the two component mediums have opposite signs lijimmw .",
    "this possibility arises for metal  in  insulator dielectric composites herwin , mlw01 and has recently become feasible with the fabrication of dielectric ",
    "magnetic materials displaying a negative index of refraction in the microwave frequency range helby , smith .    over many years",
    ", several theoretical formalisms have been developed in order to estimate the effective constitutive parameters of particulate composite mediums l96 .",
    "in particular , the maxwell garnett and the bruggeman homogenization formalisms have been widely used ward .",
    "generally , the maxwell garnett formalism is seen to hold only for dilute composite mediums mg .",
    "more widely applicable is the bruggeman formalism that was initially founded on the intuition that the total polarization field is zero throughout the hcm brugge .",
    "a rigorous basis for the bruggeman formalism is also available , within the framework of the strong  permittivity  fluctuation theory ( spft ) k81 , mlw00 .",
    "estimates of hcm constitutive parameters generated by homogenization formalisms may be required to lie within certain bounds .",
    "in particular , the wiener bounds wiener , aspnes and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds s are often invoked . the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds coincide with the constitutive parameter estimates of the maxwell garnett homogenization formalism aspnes .",
    "the applicability of theoretical bounds on the hcm permittivity has recently been the focus of attention for composites specified by relative permittivities with positive  valued real parts ihvola .    in this communication",
    ", we consider the application of the bruggeman formalism , together with the wiener and hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds , to isotropic dielectric hcms which arise from component mediums characterized by complex  valued relative permittivities whose real parts have opposite signs .",
    "this is scenario is typical of metal  in  insulator hcms aspnes , milton , for example . by duality",
    ", our analysis extends to isotropic magnetic hcms .",
    "it also extends to isotropic dielectric  magnetic hcms , because the permeability and the permittivity are then independent of each other in the bruggeman formalism kampia ( as also in the maxwell garnett formalism lak92 ) .",
    "therefore , our findings are very relevant to the application of homogenization formalisms lijimmw to mediums displaying negative index of refraction lmw03 , for example .",
    "furthermore , the implications of our mathematical study extend beyond the bruggeman formalism to the spft as well mackay03 .    a note on notation : an @xmath0 time ",
    "dependence is implicit in the following sections ; and the real and imaginary parts of complex  valued quantities are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "consider the homogenization of two isotropic dielectric component mediums labelled @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let their relative permittivities be denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . for later convenience , we define @xmath7    the bruggeman estimate of the hcm relative permittivity , namely @xmath8 , is provided implicitly via the relation ward @xmath9 wherein @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the respective volume fractions of component mediums @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the particles of both component mediums are assumed to be spherical .",
    "the bruggeman equation emerges naturally within the spft framework mackay03 .",
    "a rearrangement of gives the quadratic equation @xmath12 only those @xmath8solutions of are valid under the principle of causality as encapsulated by the kramers  kronig relations bh which conform to the restriction @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the discriminant of the quadratic equation ; i.e. , @xmath15 since @xmath16 , we may express as @xmath17 an insight into the applicability of the bruggeman formalism may be gained by considering the @xmath10roots of the equation @xmath18 ; these are as follows : @xmath19 on restricting attention to nondissipative component mediums ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) , it is clear that @xmath21 are complex  valued if @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , @xmath23 which implies that @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath21 are real  valued if @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the bruggeman estimate @xmath8 for @xmath26 may be complex  valued with nonzero imaginary part , even though neither component medium is dissipative .",
    "various bounds on the hcm relative permittivity have been developed .",
    "two of the most widely used are the wiener bounds wiener , aspnes @xmath27 and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds s @xmath28 while both the wiener bounds and the hashin  shtrikman bounds were originally derived for real  valued constitutive parameters , generalizations to complex  valued constitutive parameters have been established milton .",
    "the hashin  shtrikman bound @xmath29 is equivalent to the maxwell garnett estimate of the hcm relative permittivity @xmath30 based on spherical particles of component medium @xmath3 embedded in the host component medium @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , @xmath31 is equivalent to the maxwell garnett estimate of the hcm relative permittivity @xmath32 based on spherical particles of component medium @xmath4 embedded in the host component medium @xmath3 .",
    "the estimate @xmath30 is valid for @xmath33 , whereas the estimate @xmath32 is valid for @xmath34 ; but see the footnote in section 1 .    to gain insights into the asymptotic behaviour of the wiener and hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds , let us again restrict attention to the case of nondissipative component mediums ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) . from , we see that @xmath36 remains finite for all values of @xmath37 , but @xmath38 may become infinite for @xmath25 since @xmath39 in a similar vein , from we find that @xmath40 thus , for all values of @xmath41 there exists a value of @xmath42 at which @xmath43 is unbounded .",
    "analogously , @xmath44 so we can always find a value of @xmath45 at which @xmath46 is unbounded , provided that @xmath47 .",
    "let us now present , calculated values of the hcm relative permittivity @xmath8 , along with the corresponding values of the bounds @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for some representative examples .",
    "both nondissipative and dissipative hcms are considered for @xmath50 .",
    "the effects of dissipation may be very clearly appreciated through first considering the idealized situation wherein the components mediums are nondissipative vandehulst .",
    "furthermore , although the absence of dissipation is unphysical due to the dictates of causality bh , weak dissipation in a particular spectral regime is definitely possible and is then often ignored ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2.5 ) .",
    "thus , it is instructive to begin with the commonplace scenario wherein both @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for example , let @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in figure  1",
    ", @xmath8 is plotted against @xmath10 , along with the corresponding wiener bounds @xmath48 and hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds @xmath49 .",
    "the latter bounds are stricter than the former bounds in the sense that @xmath55 the close agreement between @xmath8 and the lower hashin  shtrikman bound @xmath43 at low volume fractions @xmath10 is indicative of the fact that @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , @xmath8 agrees closely with the upper hashin ",
    "shtrikman bound @xmath46 at high values of @xmath10 since @xmath57 .",
    "a markedly different situation develops if the real  valued @xmath58 and @xmath59 have opposite signs .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath8 calculated for @xmath60 and @xmath54 are graphed against @xmath10 in figure  2 , together with the corresponding wiener and hashin  shtrikman bounds .",
    "the bruggeman estimate @xmath8 is complex  valued with nonzero imaginary part for @xmath61 .",
    "this estimate is not physically reasonable . the bruggeman homogenization formalism    unlike the spft which is its natural generalization    has no mechanism for taking coherent scattering losses into account .",
    "furthermore , no account has been taken in the bruggeman equation for the finite size of the particles lijaem , pls , shan96 .",
    "therefore , the bruggeman estimate of the hcm relative permittivity is required to be real  valued if the component mediums are nondissipative .    while @xmath8 in figure  2 is complex  valued , the wiener bounds and the hashin  shtrikman bounds are both real  valued . in accordance with , we see that @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 in the limit @xmath65 , as may be anticipated from .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath56 , the maxwell garnett formalism is clearly inappropriate here .",
    "we also observe that the inequalities which hold for @xmath66 , do not hold for @xmath25 .",
    "let us now investigate @xmath8 and its associated bounds when the component mediums are dissipative ; i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "we begin with those cases for which @xmath66 : for example , we take @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in figure  3",
    ", @xmath8 is plotted against @xmath10 , and the associated wiener bounds @xmath48 and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds @xmath70 are also presented .",
    "the behaviour of the real parts of @xmath8 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 closely resembles that displayed in the nondissipative example of figure  1 .",
    "in fact , the following generalization of holds : @xmath71 however , this ordering does not extend to the imaginary parts of @xmath8 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    turning to the cases for @xmath25 , we let @xmath72 and @xmath69 , for example . the corresponding bruggeman estimate @xmath8 is graphed as function of @xmath10 , along with the wiener bounds @xmath48 and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds @xmath49 in figure  4 . since @xmath73 ,",
    "the real parts of @xmath38 and @xmath43 remain finite , unlike in the corresponding nondissipative scenario presented in figure  2 .    however , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath38 and @xmath43 exhibit strong resonances in the vicinity of @xmath74 ( for @xmath38 ) and @xmath75 ( for @xmath43 ) .",
    "these resonances become considerably more pronounced if the degree of dissipation exhibited by the component mediums is reduced . for example , in figure  5 the graphs corresponding to figure  4 are reproduced for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we observe in particular that @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the bruggeman estimate @xmath8 vastly exceeds both the wiener bounds @xmath48 and the hashin  shtrikman bounds @xmath49 for a wide range of @xmath10 . since @xmath80 , the estimates of @xmath81 are clearly unreasonable .",
    "furthermore , since the real and imaginary parts of @xmath82 exhibit sharp resonances at @xmath83 , we may infer that the maxwell garnett formalism is inapplicable for @xmath25 .      on comparing figures  4 and 5 ,",
    "we conclude that the bruggeman formalism , the weiner bounds and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds become increasing inappropriate as the degree of dissipation decreases towards zero .",
    "this means that all three _ could _ be applicable rather well when the dissipation is not weak .",
    "therefore , let us examine the scenario wherein the real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivities of the component medium are of the same order of magnitude ; i.e. , we take @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding plots of the bruggeman estimate @xmath8 together with the wiener bounds @xmath48 and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds @xmath49 are presented in figure  6 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the bruggeman estimate are physically plausible , and both lie within the hashin  shtrikman bounds . the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds themselves do not exhibit resonances , and the weiner bounds do not exhibit strong resonances . accordingly , we conclude that many previously published results are not erroneous , but caution is still advised .",
    "the bruggeman homogenization formalism is well  established in the context of isotropic dielectric hcms , as well as more generally l96 . however",
    ", this formalism was shown in section 3.2 to be inapplicable for hcms which arise from two isotropic dielectric component mediums , characterized by relative permittivities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with    * @xmath86 and @xmath87 having opposite signs ; and * @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "since the bruggeman formalism provides the comparison medium which underpins the spft , it may be inferred that the spft is likewise not applicable to the scenarios of ( i ) with ( ii ) .",
    "it is also demonstrated in section 3.2 that both the wiener bounds and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds can exhibit strong resonances when the component mediums are characterized by ( i ) with ( ii ) . in the vicinity of resonances , these bounds clearly do not constitute tight bounds on the hcm relative permittivity . as a direct consequence , the maxwell garnett homogenization formalism , like the bruggeman homogenization formalism , is inapplicable to the scenarios of ( i ) with ( ii ) .",
    "this limitation also extends to the recently developed incremental img and differential dmg variants of the maxwell garnett formalism .",
    "if the component mediums are sufficiently dissipative then the bruggeman formalism and the hashin  shtrikman bounds ( and therefore also the maxwell garnett formalism ) provide physically plausible estimates , despite the real parts of the component medium relative permittivities having opposite signs    as shown in section 3.3 . the explicit delineation of the appropriate parameter range(s ) for the bruggeman formalism and the hashin ",
    "shtrikman bounds is a matter for future investigation .",
    "bounds can , of course , be violated by a formalism if the underlying conditions for the formalism are in conflict with those used for deriving the bounds .",
    "sihvola ihvola has catalogued the following conflicts :    * bounds derived for nondissipative component mediums can be invalid for the real parts of either @xmath30 or @xmath32 for a composite medium containing dissipative component mediums .",
    "* percolation can not be can not be captured by the maxwell garnett formalism herwin , sasta .",
    "hence , the hashin  shtrikman bounds , being based on the maxwell garnett formalism , can be violated by the bruggeman estimate @xmath8 for a percolative composite medium . *",
    "the derivations of bounds generally assume that the particles in a composite medium have simple shapes .",
    "if the particle shapes are complicated , the composite medium may display properties not characteristic of the either of the component mediums .",
    "for instance , magnetic properties can be displayed when the particles in a composite medium have complex shapes @xcite , even though the component mediums are nonmagnetic .",
    "clearly , the magnetic analogs of @xmath38 , @xmath36 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are then inapplicable .",
    "* @xmath38 , @xmath36 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 as well as their magnetic analogs are also invalid _ prima facie _ when the component mediums exhibit magnetoelectric properties mackay03,lijaem , mich00 .",
    "* bounds derived for electrically small particles become inapplicable with increasing frequency , due to the emergence of finite  size effects pls .",
    "even the concept of homogenization becomes questionable with increasing electrical size @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the bounds and the homogenization formalisms studied in this paper share the same premises ; yet , a conflict arises in certain situations because the bounds exhibit resonance while the homogenization estimates do not .",
    "as several conventional approaches to homogenization are not appropriate to the hcms arising from component mediums characterized by ( i ) with ( ii ) , there is a requirement for new theoretical techniques to treat this case .",
    "this requirement is all the more pressing , given the growing scientific and technological importance of new types of metamaterials walser , lmw03 ."
