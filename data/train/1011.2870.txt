    "the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model has become a well - known toy model to address the intricate relationships between dynamics and statistical mechanics of long - range interacting systems .",
    "it is defined by the following hamiltonian @xmath2 , \\label{eqn : hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the number of particles , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote respectively the position and momentum of the @xmath5 particle . a useful collective quantity to introduce is the magnetization vector @xmath6 with @xmath7 the average energy per particle @xmath8 reads then @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the modulus of the magnetization vector .",
    "recently , much interest has been devoted to the so - called quasi - stationary states ( qss ) which are known to be responsible for the very slow convergence towards the statistical mechanics equilibrium predictions . far from being difficult to generate ,",
    "these qss naturally emerge from waterbag initial distributions @xcite .",
    "it is also known that initial waterbag conditions in momenta , associated to zero or almost zero initial magnetization , induce the longest lasting qss .",
    "however , when lowering towards zero the initial temperature of the particles , it is possible to exhibit waterbag momenta configurations with vanishing magnetization which converge exponentially towards the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .",
    "this calls for a linear theory approach .",
    "linear stability of the hmf model about unmagnetized equilibrium states has been up to now mostly studied within the vlasov framework @xcite , which assumes in particular an infinite number of particles .",
    "moreover , to the authors knowledge , the linear stability of spatially inhomogeneous , unmagnetized , equilibria has not been considered yet , even in the continuous vlasov approach .",
    "the motivation of the present study is then twofold : firstly and mostly , one wishes to tackle the linear study of the unmagnetized cold hmf equilibria , within a finite-@xmath0 , therefore exact , framework ; secondly , the ensuing nonlinear dynamics is briefly addressed to show that the thermalization of cold unmagnetized hmf systems finely illustrates lynden - bell s concept of violent relaxation for long - range systems .    in section [ sec_linear ] , we shall establish the finite-@xmath0 framework used for the linear stability derivation . in section [ section_linearn ] , we shall calculate the exact linear growth rates for two finite-@xmath0 equilibria , both of zero temperature and zero magnetization , and compare them to numerical simulations .",
    "section [ sec_random ] is dedicated to a random matrix approach for the calculation of non - deterministic symmetric initial states growth rates .",
    "section [ section_vlasov ] tackles the general case , including the spatially inhomogeneous ones by introducing a fluid approach based on vlasov framework .",
    "section [ section_violent ] ends this study by discussing the connections between the linear features just derived and the hmf thermalization properties .",
    "the dynamics of the cold unmagnetized hmf model is proposed as a paradigm of violent relaxation .",
    "the equations of motion can straightforwardly be written from equation ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) as @xmath11 using equation ( [ eqn : magnet ] ) , the force acting on the particle @xmath12 may be written as @xmath13 let us consider unmagnetized finite-@xmath0 equilibria , namely stationary states of the equations of motion ( [ eqn : motion ] ) , with @xmath14 . this amounts to have @xmath15 and angles @xmath16 distributed in such a way that @xmath14 .",
    "let us remark that , since the total momentum @xmath17 is a constant of motion , the zero momentum equilibrium case considered here is just the cold ( i.e. monokinetic ) case for the special choice @xmath18 .",
    "let us perform the linear stability of this system . in that purpose",
    ", we write @xmath19 and @xmath20 where the asterisk denotes the unperturbed solution . at first order in @xmath21 ,",

    "hence , @xmath33 in other words , writing @xmath34 the characteristic polynomial of @xmath35 , one has @xmath36 this factorization allows us to focus only on the matrix @xmath27 , and deduce the eigenvalues of the higher - order matrix @xmath30 by taking the square root of @xmath27 ones .",
    "we shall now study the case of two particular finite-@xmath0 equilibria that advantageously simplify @xmath27 .",
    "having in mind the computational plasma terminology , we define the so - called `` quiet start '' configuration as the equilibrium characterized by an equirepartition of the particles on the circle .",

    "every particle is moved by a uniformly randomized quantity @xmath49 .",

    "the previous case involved a finite-@xmath0 analog of a homogeneous vlasov force - free equilibrium .",
    "we can construct another finite-@xmath0 equilibrium with zero magnetization by uniformly distributing @xmath51 particles in a cluster of size @xmath52 centered on a given position , and by settling the positions of the @xmath51 remaining ones by rotating the first cluster by @xmath53 with @xmath54 figure [ fig : biclusteric ] shows an example of such a bi - cluster configuration .",
    "bi - clustered equilibrium where each particle has a zero momentum and faces its symmetric on the circle , providing a zero magnetization . ]",
    "the same stability analysis as in the homogeneous quiet start case can be performed .",
    "however , one expects now the growth rate to depend on @xmath55 , the clusters size .",

    "unfortunately , @xmath57 is not circulant either , but is a toeplitz matrix .",
    "indeed , one can write @xmath62 . a work performed by treichler @xcite showed that for a @xmath63 toeplitz matrix generated from the coefficients @xmath64 , the only two non - zero eigenvalues are @xmath65",
    "allows us to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath66 of the matrix @xmath57 @xmath67 equations ( [ eqn : decomposition ] ) , ( [ eqn : decomposition2 ] ) and ( [ treichler_appl ] ) give the growth rate as @xmath68 that is , in the large @xmath0 limit , @xmath69 up to @xmath70 terms . figure ( [ fig : accord_bcqs ] ) shows the comparison between the numerically computed growth rates and the theoretical prediction of equation ( [ eqn : bcqs ] ) .     for slightly perturbed bicluster initial configurations .",
    "the circles correspond to exponential fits from the numerically integrated magnetization , and the solid curve corresponds to equation ( [ eqn : bcqs ] ) .",

    "we should note that in reference @xcite , the authors diagonalize the matrix @xmath73 and give an analytic expression of its two non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "however , using their formula for a practical calculus requires the knowledge of an implicitely defined parameter @xmath74 , which analytical calculation , in a finite-@xmath0 context , is impossible , let alone some degenerate cases .",
    "in this section , we will only consider symmetric equilibria prepared to give @xmath75 in the following way : we distribute @xmath51 particles at random on a partition of a given length and put the @xmath51 remaining particles by shifting the random ones by @xmath53 . using the appropriate indexation of particles ( see ( [ bicluster_sym ] ) ) , the calculation of growth rates amounts to determine the largest eigenvalue of the @xmath76 matrix @xmath57 defined by @xmath77 where the particle positions @xmath78 are distributed according to some @xmath79 , and where the @xmath80 normalization factor has been voluntarily omitted so that the coefficients distribution do not depend on the number of particles .",
    "we used a method based on random matrix theory to calculate the growth rate s expectation .",
    "when the random coefficients verify @xmath81 , an extension of wigner s law @xcite states that the largest eigenvalue is asymptotically approximated by @xmath82 where @xmath83 . since @xmath84 , theorem @xmath85 in reference @xcite states that @xmath86 has a normal distribution of expectation @xmath87 and bounded finite variance @xmath88 . using equations ( [ eqn : decomposition ] ) and ( [ eqn : decomposition2 ] ) , one finds the mean squared growth rate  as @xmath89 .",

    "this approach simplifies the calculation of the growth rate , since no more effort in the diagonalization of matrix @xmath27 has to be done .",

    "the conditions on the probability distribution of @xmath95 are not as limiting as the required symmetry of the initial state .      the equilibrium configuration generated by two symmetric waterbags of parameter @xmath52 yields a state topologically close to eqs .",
    "( [ bicluster_sym ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the growth rates for these random states to be close to the ones given in",
    ". however , the latter equation can not be the asymptotic form of equation ( [ eqn : rmt ] ) since the highest eigenvalue fluctuates around @xmath87 , which corresponds to the eigenvalue of the deterministic matrix @xmath96 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , that is completely different from the deterministic matrix @xmath57 defined by equation ( [ eqn : letr ] ) .",

    "when the magnetization is almost exponential , @xmath157 is practically constant and matches the theoretical value given by equation ( [ eqn : v_growth ] ) , represented by the horizontal lines .",

    "all the runs have been performed using @xmath159 particles . ]",
    "we shall now briefly discuss the large - time nonlinear features of the hmf model in the light of lynden - bell s picture of violent relaxation .",
    "as two - body , collisional , relaxation timescales were far too large to account for the observed luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies , the concept of violent relaxation was introduced by lynden - bell in his famous 1967 paper @xcite . following this seminal study , there appears to be nowadays a common agreement on the scenario of the relaxation process for @xmath0-body long - range systems .",
    "it is supposed to be divided in two parts : the properly speaking violent relaxation part , namely a rapid evolution of the system towards a quasi - stationary metastable stable , followed by a much slower thermalization phase towards the state predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the hmf model provides a simple yet nontrivial long - range system to consider this issue .",
    "extensive numerical studies of the hmf model are now available in the literature , mostly for two types of initial states : waterbag initial distribution functions in positions and momenta and maxwellian initial distribution functions in momenta with possibly waterbag initial distribution functions for positions .",
    "long - time discrepancies between time averaged observables and their ensemble predictions have been reported only with initial waterbag distributions in momenta , in connection with the emergence of so - called quasi - stationary states .",
    "linear theory , mostly done within the vlasov framework and for spatially homogeneous states , can be used as a guideline to discuss relaxation properties in the spirit of lynden - bell s picture .",
    "for instance , the spatially homogeneous cases with initial waterbag distributions in momenta are unstable with growth rates equal to @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the initial temperature associated to the waterbag . consequently ,",
    "for @xmath162 the system becomes linearly stable .",
    "this case corresponds to a density energy @xmath163 equal to @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "this value happens to coincide with the energy threshold value above which pathological relaxation behaviours have been reported for spatially homogeneous , waterbag in momenta , initial distributions functions .",
    "there is then a simple , but apparently not explicitly formulated , manner to interpret the relaxation features observed in the hmf model : an efficient , rapid , convergence towards equilibrium statistical mechanics predictions _ requires _ starting from the vicinity of an initially unstable equilibrium .",
    "linear instability then naturally provides the violent relaxation phase .",
    "the cold case , on which we have just focused , illustrates well this scenario .",
    "actually , large - time simulations show that the modulus of the magnetization , for instance , quickly converges towards a saturated state with a value that is close to its ensemble prediction .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar observations have been reported for another long - range , mean - field , wave - particle hamiltonian model starting with a cold beam of particles @xcite . an heuristic way to explain this rapid convergence is through the comparison between the linear and nonlinear timescales available in the system .",
    "the linear timescale is obviously given by the e - folding time , namely by the inverse of the linear growth rate @xmath165 .",
    "the nonlinear timescale is the trapping time of the particles in the mean - field potential well , namely the inverse of the bounce frequency @xmath166 .",
    "nonlinear saturation takes place when both timescales balance , namely for @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , one expects nonlinear saturation to take place close to equilibrium predictions provided that the linear growth rate is of the order of the ensemble average of the nonlinear frequency .",
    "this is indeed the case for the cold system for which @xmath168 . according to equilibrium statistical dynamics @xcite , this gives @xmath169 where the inverse of the temperature is given implicitly by @xmath170 .",
    "numerically , the ensemble average of the magnetization for the cold hmf is then @xmath171 and the equilibrium temperature is @xmath172 , which does yield @xmath173 .",
    "figure [ fig : monitoringm ] shows that the cold unmagnetized hmf does experience a violent relaxation .",
    "the figure makes however apparent that that this phase is followed by a much slower thermalization phase that is needed for phase space sweeping and convergence towards equilibrium statistical predictions . actually , in the early nonlinear saturation , the magnetization oscillates about 0.60 , below the ensemble equilibrium value .",
    "the drift towards the equilibrium statistical predictions takes place on a much longer timescale than the violent relaxation timescale , which is the nonlinear saturation timescale of order @xmath174 ."
