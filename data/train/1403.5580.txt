    "despite negative searches at the lhc thus far , tev scale supersymmetry ( susy ) remains the leading resolution to the hierarchy problem , particularly in light of the discovery of a higgs boson not much above the @xmath1-mass . whilst experimental searches and theoretical considerations suggest that most of the susy spectrum should be above the weak scale , it is quite conceivable that certain neutral states could be substantially lighter .",
    "such light sparticles could have interesting cosmological and astrophysical implications . here",
    "we shall focus on the prospect of kev - scale susy states which can decay in such a manner as to produce observable x - ray signals .",
    "we are inspired to think about decays of light particles by the tentative 3.5 kev line observed in the combined spectra of multiple galaxy clusters as studied by the xmm - newton x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "thus we shall typically phrase our discussion in terms of this benchmark point and examine models of dark matter which might accommodate this phenomenon .",

    "as is well known , the canonical susy extension of the standard model , the mssm , requires the imposition of an ( _ ad hoc _ ) discrete @xmath2 symmetry : @xmath0-parity ( -1)^3(b - l)+2s  . under this discrete symmetry the standard model ( superpartner )",

    ", the parent state must be around the kev scale . more specifically ,",
    "to match the recent anomaly at 3.5 kev @xcite the parent state should be roughly 7 kev .",
    "since we suppose that the lsp constitutes the dark matter , this will be ` warm ' dark matter .",
    "it should be noted that sub - kev thermally produced ` hot ' dark matter leads to the erasure of density perturbations at scales shorter than its free streaming length and is in conflict with observations of small scale structure , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "although the cluster anomaly at 3.5 kev might be regarded as tentative at this stage , it provides motivation for us to explore interesting , non - standard , scenarios of susy .",

    "[ s3 ] , we explore the prospect of generating x - ray lines from decaying bino dark matter and argue that this is quite possible .",
    "however , as we discuss , obtaining the correct relic density for bino dark matter requires significant model building . in sect .",
    "[ s4 ] , we examine the motivation for light hidden sector photini and argue that such a state could be the lsp .",
    "we show that a 7 kev hidden photino lsp can have a suitable abundance to match the observed dark matter relic density and give rise to the 3.5 kev cluster line via @xmath0-parity violating decays .",
    "the archetypal example of a motivated light superpartner which can , in principle , decay on cosmological timescales is the gravitino .",
    "the gravitino is an integral aspect of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "the mass of this state , which is tied to the scale of @xmath3-term susy breaking , is an unknown parameter and could vary over a large range .",
    "once susy is broken the effects of this breaking will generically be mediated via planck suppressed operators . however ,",
    "if the superpartners of the standard model states feel additional sources of susy breaking , then the gravitino can be significantly lighter than the rest of the superpartner spectrum .",
    "the typical scale of the susy soft masses due to gauge mediation is ~  , [ gm ] where @xmath4 is the mass scale of the susy breaking mediators and @xmath3 is a susy breaking f - term . whereas the gravitino mass is set by gravity mediation m_3/2=  .",
    "[ 3/2 ] this permits for large separations in the mass scales @xmath5 provided @xmath6 . whilst the gravitino is a well motivated candidate",
    ", we find that its lifetime is typically too long to reproduce the anomaly of interest .",
    "a gravitino with mass @xmath7 in the mssm will decay via @xmath8 in the presence of @xmath0-parity violation .",
    "the details of the lsp decay depend on how the dominant source @xmath0-parity is introduced and decays due to the presence of either the bilinear or trilinear rpv operator of eq .",
    "( [ rpv ] ) with sizeable couplings are of particular interest , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "; for instance , in the case of @xmath0-parity violation due the bilinear operator @xmath11 , the gravitino can decay to @xmath12 via a neutrino - bino mixing term and this factor is parametrically @xmath13 .",

    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath15 few kev the gravitino is essentially stable for all phenomenological purposes .",
    "given that the gravitino scenario is seemingly unviable , we shall consider alternative lsp candidates which could generate this signal through decay processes . specifically",
    ", we shall focus on models in which the lsp is a light bino or hidden sector photino .",
    "it is traditional to constrain the values of the soft masses with gut boundary conditions , which fix the ratios of the susy breaking gaugino majorana masses m_1=^2_w m_2  .",
    "[ m1 ] this typically implies that the binos and winos should receive comparable masses , and experimental bounds under this assumption limit the mass of the lightest neutralino to be in excess of around 50 gev @xcite . if the condition eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) is not imposed then there is a great deal more freedom in the relative masses of the electroweakino states . in particular , it is possible to tune the soft masses @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that the neutralino mass matrix develops a vanishing eigenvalue and thus the lightest neutralino can potentially be ultra - light or even massless @xcite . for the mssm a vanishing eigenvalue for the neutralino mass matrix occurs for m_1=  . notably , if this light neutralino is essentially pure bino , as is typical , it circumvents the current direct search bounds over much of parameter space @xcite .",
    "a light bino lsp can be realised in an alternative manner , which does not require tuning of the mssm electroweak soft masses .",
    "gaugino majorana masses can be forbidden at leading order by an @xmath0-symmetry broken only by @xmath19-scale operators , in which case the gauginos will typically be very light .",
    "however , if the mssm spectrum is supplemented with additional chiral superfields transforming as an su(2 ) triplet @xmath20 and an su(3 ) octet @xmath21 then the winos and gluinos can acquire masses via dirac terms of the form @xcite",
    "^2  , where @xmath22 is a spurion field which develops a @xmath23-term .",
    "thus , the winos and gluino receive masses of order @xmath24 and for appropriate sizes of the d - term breaking and mediation scale these can be phenomenologically viable ( i.e.  tev scale ) . in the absence of a gauge singlet chiral superfield field ( which are often deemed undesirable , as they can result in tadpole problems , see e.g.  @xcite ) the bino will only receive a mass contribution from anomaly mediation @xcite",
    "m_~m_3/2~7  kev ( )  .",
    "[ am ] in this manner a natural hierarchy emerges between the bino and the other sparticles , as in @xcite , due only to the spectrum and symmetry structure .",
    "it should be noted that an mev gravitino is cosmologically stable and , hence , also gives a contribution to the dark matter relic density of order @xcite _ 3/2h^2~0.01 ( ) ( ) ( ) ^2  .",
    "if the dark matter relic density has significant contributions from both bino and gravitino components , then the lifetime of the decaying bino lsp must be scaled linearly , in terms of its fractional contribution to the relic density , in order match the observed flux . for simplicity we shall focus on scenarios in which the bino accounts for essentially all of the dark matter relic density .",
    "this case arises , for instance , if the reheat temperature is low @xmath25 tev , such that only a small abundance of gravitinos is thermally produced .",
    "a kev scale bino lsp can decay at loop level in the presence of one of the @xmath0-parity violating trilinear operators of eq .",
    "( [ rpv ] ) .",
    "specifically , we consider the case involving the leptonic operator @xmath26 , leading to the diagram illustrated in fig .",

    "the lifetime of the bino decaying @xmath27 is given by @xcite _ 510 ^ 27  s ( ) ^2 ( ) ^4 ( ) ^3 . [ 11 ] note that experimental limits bound the coupling to be @xmath28 , assuming that this is the sole source of @xmath0-parity violation @xcite . in the presence of multiple operators these limits can become substantially stronger @xcite .",
    "thus provided that @xmath0-parity is only violated slightly then a 7 kev bino can be cosmologically stable and present a decay rate suitable to explain the 3.5 kev cluster line",
    ". settings in which certain @xmath0-parity violating operators occur with small coefficients have been suggested in the literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the above trilinear rpv operator will typically induce a sneutrino vev @xmath29 which can provide an alternative decay process , as in fig.[fig ] : centre panel . in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) we have assumed that this vev is small such that the rpv operator @xmath30 sets the bino lifetime .",
    "further , sneutrino vevs can arise in alternative manners , for instance via the rpv bilinear @xmath31 .",
    "the magnitude of the vev is model dependent and linked to the associated rpv coupling constant which can ( and is often required to ) be small , see e.g.  @xcite . for the case of the bilinear operator @xmath31 a sneutrino vev is generated of order @xcite @xmath32    accordingly , the lifetime of a bino decaying via the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig ] : centre panel is given by @xcite  _ 10 ^ 28  s ( ) ^4 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^3 .",
    "[ snu ] thus a lifetime appropriate to match the aforementioned cluster anomaly can be found for reasonable values of the slepton masses and sneutrino vev , with some parameter freedom .",

    "[ nu ] observational limits on the neutrino masses ( @xmath33 ev ) constrain the size of the sneutrino vev .",
    "one potential difficultly is that , as the bino annihilation rate is low , if it is produced thermally then it is typically overproduced and consequently it is challenging to realise the observed relic density via freeze out .",
    "furthermore , it is unlikely that the relic density can be reduced via tuning the reheat temperature @xcite to below the mass of the bino @xmath34 , as observations indicate that the temperature of the universe was in excess of a few mev .",
    "this is supported by the successful predictions of the primordial abundances of nuclei in theories of big bang nucleosynthesis , see e.g  @xcite .",
    "one manner to potentially achieve the correct density of bino dark matter is the _ assimilation _ mechanism of deramo , fei and thaler @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the mssm is supplemented with new exotic states @xmath35 which carry a particle asymmetry such that their number density remains considerable at temperatures below their mass .",
    "these exotic states co - annihilate efficiently with the bino lsp via @xmath36 ( assimilation , see fig .",
    "[ fig ] : right panel ) and @xmath37 ( destruction ) , where @xmath38 is the hypercharge gauge boson .",
    "subsequently , late decays of @xmath39 to the bino lsp , which may violate the global quantum number carried by the @xmath35 , are responsible for setting the bino abundance .",
    "clearly the @xmath35 must be sufficiently long lived such that they do not decay before the bino abundance is suitably depleted .",
    "since the production of binos from the thermal bath is only suppressed once the bath cools to below the bino mass , the @xmath35 must survive to below @xmath40 .",
    "for a 7 kev bino this corresponds to a temperature around 300 ev . if these states decay after recombination ( @xmath41 1 ev ) then this can lead to cmb signals which are strongly constrained , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "further , there are stringent bounds on hadronic decays of the @xmath35 or @xmath39 from measurements of big bang nucleosynthesis observables @xcite . for non - hadronic decays of the @xmath35 and @xmath39",
    "prior to recombination , constraints on energy injection can be satisfied , in particular for the case @xmath42 . thus viable models can be constructed with bino abundances appropriate to account for the dark matter relic density .",
    "also there could be a potentially observable deviation in the number of additional relativistic species @xmath43 due to the binos remaining in thermal equilibrium later than neutrino decoupling , see e.g.  @xcite .    under the assumption that the @xmath39 is the nlsp and each @xmath39 decay produces a single bino lsp , an estimate for the required particle asymmetry @xmath44 in order to generate the dark matter relic density can be found from the relation between the @xmath39 asymmetry and the bino mass  ,",
    "where @xmath45 gev is the proton mass and @xmath46 is the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the ratio of relic densities is determined to be @xmath47 , hence for @xmath48 kev this implies _  10 ^ 6_b610 ^ -4  .",
    "thus this scenario requires a significantly larger asymmetry than that associated to baryon number .",
    "this is a mild departure to the original model of @xcite in which it was envisaged that baryon asymmetry would be generated via the late decays of the @xmath35 and @xmath39 states , which is a requirement we do not retain here .",
    "this setting provides one method for obtaining the correct relic abundance of bino dark matter and it is conceivable that alternative mechanisms might be constructed .",
    "given the moderate model building necessary to obtain the observed relic density for kev bino dark matter , we turn to the possibility that the lsp is not a standard mssm state , but rather the superpartner of some u(1 ) vector boson sequestered from the visible sector .",
    "indeed , the existence of ( many ) light hidden sector abelian vector bosons , and their associated superpartners , are motivated by string theory @xcite . in type iib",
    "string theory each 3-cycle @xmath49 , labelled by @xmath50 , can be associated to a 4d vector field in terms of the ramond - ramond form @xmath51 a_^i=__i^3c_4  .",
    "these vector bosons inherit a gauge symmetry from the 10d gauge symmetry of @xmath51 .",
    "typically in realistic string compactifications there are @xmath52 3-cycles , and as many associated gauge bosons .",
    "whilst a large number of these gauge symmetries are likely broken in the uv , by fluxes or otherwise , some may remain unbroken in the low energy theory @xcite .",
    "there can also be further hidden u(1 ) gauge symmetries arising from branes separated from the standard model brane stack on the compactification manifold .",
    "if these branes have only vector - like matter content with high scale masses ( which is a common scenario ) , then the low energy theory contains an unbroken u(1 ) with no light charged states @xcite .",
    "after susy is broken and the effects of this breaking are mediated to the hidden sectors , the fermion partners to these hidden sector gauge bosons receive soft masses accordingly . furthermore , it is natural for these hidden sector photini to be significantly lighter than visible sector sparticles if they only feel susy breaking via gravitational effects . in this case",
    "the photini will acquire masses near the gravitino mass @xmath53 of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ 3/2 ] ) or , alternatively , eq .",
    "( [ am ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the visible sector superpartners , including the gauginos , can obtain their masses via some other mediation mechanism leading to tev soft masses in the visible sector , for example via gauge mediation as given in eq .",

    "such kinetic mixing between u(1 ) s generically arises due to planck suppressed operators and , from a stringy perspective , this occurs due to open strings stretching between the standard model brane stack and hidden sector @xmath23-branes @xcite .",
