    "the elastic enhancement factor was introduced more than 50 years ago by moldauer @xcite and since then it has been frequently considered in nuclear physics @xcite and in other fields @xcite . the elastic enhancement factor",
    "@xmath5 is the ratio of variances of diagonal elements of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath6 to off - diagonal elements of this matrix @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    "the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 , where @xmath7 or @xmath8 is the symmetry index for systems with preserved and broken time reversal symmetry , respectively , is especially interesting because it can be used to study realistic open systems also in the presence of absorption .",
    "the properties of the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 have been studied in several precisely controllable systems such as microwave cavities @xcite and networks @xcite .",
    "the conjecture on the universality of the ratio of variances of the scattering elements in electromagnetic fields in the mode - stirred reverberating chambers ( time reversal invariant system ) was put forward by fiachetti and michelson @xcite .",
    "the universality of the elastic enhancement factor @xmath9 has been also tested in the wave scattering experiments with microwave cavities simulating chaotic quantum billiards @xcite in the presence of absorption .",
    "dietz et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the universality of the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 with microwave cavities in the case of preserved and partially broken time reversal symmetries .",
    "quite recently an extensive study of the elastic enhancement factor @xmath9 has been published by yeh et al .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors were also able to study the elastic enhancement factor for microwave cavities with time reversal symmetry in a low absorption regime .",
    "the reciprocal quantity @xmath10 was considered theoretically and measured as a function of frequency for a chaotic microwave cavity with time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 has been also studied for microwave irregular networks @xcite simulating quantum graphs with preserved and broken time reversal symmetry in the presence of moderate and large absorption strength defined as follows : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the average resonance width and @xmath13 is the mean level spacing @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "microscopically , the absorption strength @xmath15 can be modeled by means of a huge number of open , coupled to continuum channels `` c '' , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 stands for the average @xmath18-matrix @xcite .",
    "the recent paper of kharkov and sokolov @xcite has shown that the elastic enhancement factor of open systems with a transient from the regular to chaotic internal dynamics depends on both the parameter of chaoticity @xmath19 and the openness @xmath20 .",
    "the openness @xmath20 is formally described by the same formula as the absorption strength @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the elastic enhancement factor for the systems with absorption , in a transient region between regular and chaotic dynamics , has not been studied experimentally yet . in this paper",
    "we present the results of the experimental study of the elastic enhancement factor @xmath22 @xcite for microwave rectangular and rough cavities , coupled to the vector network analyzer through antennas , simulating respectively , partially chaotic and chaotic two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum billiards with preserved time reversal symmetry ( @xmath7 ) in the presence of moderate absorption .",
    "the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 is defined by the relationship @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the variance of the scattering matrix element @xmath25 of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath26\\mbox{.}\\ ] ]    for small and intermediate values of the parameter @xmath27 the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 might depend both on the parameter @xmath27 and on the coupling to the system @xcite . however , for large absorption strength @xmath28 the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 can be approximated by the formula : @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "fiachetti @xcite showed that in the case of the stochastic environment which can be characterized by a statistically isotropic scattering matrix the elastic enhancement factor should have the universal value @xmath30 .",
    "recently , the two - channel problem ( e.g. , an experimental system with two ports `` a '' and `` b '' ) with internal absorption and time reversal symmetry has been numerically considered by sokolov and zhirov @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for the equivalent channels `` a '' and `` b '' with the transmission coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the elastic enhancement factor @xmath9 depends both on the transmission coefficient @xmath33 and internal absorption and can take , respectively , the values between 3 and 2 .",
    "thereafter , we will use the abbreviation @xmath34 .",
    "in the experiment we used a microwave rectangular cavity to simulate a two dimensional ( 2d ) billiard in a transient region between regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "a quantum chaotic billiard was simulating by a rough microwave cavity .",
    "if the excitation frequency @xmath35 is below @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the speed of light in the vacuum and @xmath38 is the height of the cavity , only the transverse magnetic @xmath39 mode can be excited inside the cavity .",
    "then , the analogy between microwave flat cavities and quantum billiards is based upon the equivalency of the helmholtz equation describing the microwave cavities and the schrdinger equation describing the quantum systems @xcite .",
    "absorption of the cavities can either be changed by changing the frequency range of the measurements , or more effectively , by the application of microwave absorbers . in this paper",
    "we are only interested in moderate absorption , for which @xmath40 @xcite and which can be controlled by the choice of the microwave frequency range .",
    "figure  1(a ) shows the scheme of the rectangular microwave cavity which was used for measuring of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath6 .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath6 of the cavity was measured in the frequency window : 1618.5 ghz .",
    "the vector network analyzer agilent e8364b was connected through the hp 85133 - 616 and hp 85133 - 617 flexible microwave cables to the two microwave antennas which were introduced inside the cavity ( holes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 in figure  1(a ) ) .",
    "the antennas wires ( diameter 0.9 mm ) were protruded 3 mm into the cavity .",
    "the measurements were completed for 10 different positions of the antennas .",
    "the width of the rectangular cavity was @xmath46 cm .",
    "different realizations of the cavity were created by the change of its length from @xmath47 to 36.5 cm in 25 steps of 0.2 cm length .",
    "figure  1(b ) shows the scheme of the rough microwave cavity @xcite .",
    "the cavity is composed of the two side wall segments .",
    "the segment ( 1 ) is described by the function @xmath48 , where the mean radius @xmath49=20.0 cm , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath52 and the phases @xmath53 are uniformly distributed on [ 0.084,0.091 ] cm and [ 0,2@xmath54 , respectively .",
    "both , the rectangular and rough cavities had the same height @xmath55 mm , so that @xmath56 ghz .    also in the case of the rough cavity the two - port scattering matrix @xmath6 was measured in the frequency range 1618.5 ghz .",
    "the 3 mm long antennas were introduced inside the cavity trough the holes @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in order to create different realizations of the rough cavity",
    "a metallic perturber with the area @xmath57 @xmath58 and the perimeter @xmath59 cm ( see panel ( b ) ) was moved inside the cavity along the sidewalls using an external magnet .",
    "the linear size of the perturber @xmath60 cm was more than 2.5 times bigger than the microwave wavelength at 16 ghz .",
    "properties of microwave cavities were investigated using the nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution @xmath61 for the microwave rectangular cavity obtained for the frequency range @xmath62 ghz is shown in figure  2(a ) ( bars ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath61 was averaged over 30 microwave cavity configurations . in this way",
    "2760 eigenfrequencies of the cavity were used in the calculations of the distribution @xmath61 .",
    "figure  2(a ) shows that in spite of using short microwave antennas the experimental distribution @xmath61 departures from the poisson distribution ( broken line ) which is characteristic for classically integrable systems .",
    "the distribution @xmath61 is also different from the theoretical prediction for gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) in rmt ( full line ) characteristic for chaotic systems with time reversal symmetry , showing the transition between integrability and chaos .",
    "for @xmath63 it is higher than the one for goe in rmt , however , for @xmath64 it is closer to the poisson distribution .",
    "this behavior is different than the one investigated by robnik and veble @xcite for irrational and rational rectangles where huge fluctuations and the departure of the distribution @xmath61 from the poisson one were reported for very small @xmath65 .",
    "the results obtained for the microwave rectangular cavity should be contrasted with the ones obtained for the nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath61 for the rough cavity ( bars in figure  2(b ) ) which shows much better agreement with the theoretical prediction for goe in rmt ( full line ) . in the case of the rough cavity",
    "the distribution @xmath61 was calculated on the basis of 3554 cavity eigenfrequencies .",
    "some small discrepancies in the experimental @xmath61 from the rmt prediction for @xmath66 are possibly connected with either some unresolved resonances or fingerprints of nonuniversal behavior of the rough cavity .",
    "similar discrepancies in the nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath61 for @xmath67 are also visible in the experimental results presented in the paper by poli et al .",
    "typical spectra of the rectangular cavity in the frequency range 16 - 17 ghz and the rough cavity in the frequency range 8 - 9 ghz are shown in figure 3(a ) and figure 3(b ) , respectively .",
    "in figure  4(a ) the elastic enhancement factor @xmath0 of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath6 of the microwave rectangular cavity is shown in a function of microwave frequency @xmath68 ghz ( full circles ) . due to significant fluctuations of the enhancement factor",
    "@xmath0 the experimental points were obtained by averaging of @xmath0 over 250 different realizations of the cavity length and the antennas positions in the frequency window @xmath69 , where @xmath70 ghz .",
    "the two black broken lines @xmath71 and @xmath4 show , respectively , the rmt limits for very strong and very low absorption .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 for the microwave rectangular cavities depends on microwave frequency and was changed from 5.2 to 7.4 with the increase of frequency @xmath72 from 16 to 18.5 ghz .",
    "according to kharkov and sokolov @xcite the elastic enhancement factor @xmath5 of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath73 evaluated within the framework of rmt can be expressed by    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the spectral form factor .",
    "the parameter of chaoticity @xmath76 changes from @xmath77 for classically integrable systems to @xmath78 for chaotic systems .",
    "it is important to note that in the transition region @xmath79 the spectral form factor @xmath75 is currently known only for systems with broken time - reversal symmetry . for integrable systems with time reversal symmetry",
    "@xmath80 which immediately leads to @xmath4 .    figure 4(a ) shows that the elastic enhancement factor @xmath0 of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath6 of the rectangular cavity is below the theoretical value @xmath4 .",
    "this result together with the complementary one for the experimental distribution @xmath61 ( see figure 2(a ) ) strongly suggests that the system simulated by the two - port microwave rectangular cavity due to scattering on the antennas departures from the integrable one .",
    "this phenomenon was predicted by seba @xcite and then thoroughly analyzed by tudorovskiy et al . @xcite .",
    "the influence of antennas on the widths of resonances in a two - dimensional rectangular microwave cavity , in much lower than investigated in this paper frequency range from below of 1 ghz to 5.5 ghz , was studied by barthlemy et al .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment relatively short , 2 mm long , antennas were used . to give an idea about the antennas performance , 3 mm long antennas used",
    "is our experiment were characterized in the frequency range 16 - 18.5 ghz by the antenna coupling @xmath81 . in the frequency range 4.5 - 5.5 ghz , which was considered in @xcite ,",
    "the same antennas were characterized by much smaller antenna coupling @xmath82 .    in order to estimate the chaoticity parameter @xmath76 for such a system we reconstructed the nearest neighbor spacing distribution shown in figure",
    "2(a ) using the random matrix potter - rosenzweig model described in @xcite , where the matrix @xmath83 is defined as follows @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 denotes a symmetric matrix which belongs to goe matrices .",
    "@xmath86 is the transition parameter .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath85 are independently gaussian distributed with the same variance @xmath87 and the mean zero .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath88 are independently distributed with the variance @xmath89 .    for the matrices @xmath83 of the size @xmath90 we found out that the parameter @xmath86 can be approximated by @xmath91 .",
    "the fit of the numerical nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath61 , calculated on the basis of 100 realizations of @xmath92 matrices , to the experimental one yields the chaoticity parameter @xmath93 .",
    "the inset in figure 2(a ) shows the numerically reconstructed nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath61 .",
    "unfortunately , even knowing the chaoticity parameter @xmath76 we are not able to compare our experimental results with the theoretical ones since the explicit form of the spectral form factor @xmath94 is not known .",
    "though the paper @xcite suggests that the behaviour of the enhancement factor for systems with time reversal symmetry should be similar to the one for systems with broken time reversal symmetry , this remains to be proven yet .",
    "just for completeness of the presentation in figure  4(a ) we also show the rmt results predicted by the equation ( 3 ) ( empty cirles ) with the spectral form factor @xmath95 defined by the equation ( 6 ) .    in figure",
    "4(b ) the elastic enhancement factor @xmath0 of the two - port scattering matrix @xmath6 of the microwave rough cavity simulating a quantum chaotic system is shown ( full black rhombi ) in a function of microwave frequency @xmath68 ghz .",
    "the results were averaged over 105 different perturber positions in the frequency window @xmath70 ghz .",
    "it is important to note that the theoretical and experimental investigations of rough billiards ( cavities ) @xcite showed that for lower energies ( frequencies ) there exist regimes of localization and wigner ergodicity , and only for higher energies ( frequencies ) billiards ( cavities ) become fully chaotic .",
    "this fully chaotic regime is called the regime of shnirelman ergodicity . for the rough cavity used in the experiment",
    "the regime of shnirelman ergodicity extends for @xmath96 ghz .",
    "the presence of the perturber causes that even for lower frequencies @xmath97 ghz the nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath61 is close to the theoretical prediction for goe in rmt .",
    "the parameter @xmath98 was estimated by adjusting the theoretical mean reflection coefficients parameterized by the parameters @xmath99    @xmath100    to the experimental ones @xmath101 obtained after eliminating the direct processes @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath102 denotes the port @xmath103 or @xmath104 . in the calculations of @xmath105 we used the analytic expression for the distribution @xmath106 of the reflection coefficient @xmath107 given in @xcite .",
    "we found out that using the same antennas , 3 mm long , as in the case of the rectangular cavity , the value of the parameter @xmath27 was changed from 5.3 to 6.8 with the increase of microwave frequency @xmath72 from 16 ghz to 18.5 ghz , respectively .",
    "taking into account that the microwave antennas act as single scattering channels the absorption strength @xmath27 can be expressed as a sum of the transmission coefficients : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 represents internal absorption of the cavity @xcite .",
    "the values of the absorption strength @xmath21 and the transmissions coefficients @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath109 are shown in table [ tab : abs ] .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  4(b ) shows that the experimental results obtained for the rough cavity are below the theoretical ones predicted for @xmath0 by the equation ( 3 ) within the framework of rmt ( empty rhombi ) . for chaotic systems ( @xmath113 ) with the symmetry index @xmath114 the spectral form factor @xmath95 in the equation ( 3 ) has the form @xcite :    @xmath115\\theta(1 - \\tau ) + [ \\tau \\log\\frac{2\\tau + 1}{2\\tau-1}-1]\\theta(\\tau-1),\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 is the heaviside step function .",
    "it is important to point out that the recent numerical results presented in @xcite for the two - channel problem with absorption give better agreement with the experimental ones . in the case of the two equivalent channels with @xmath117 and the internal absorption @xmath118",
    "the theory predicts @xmath0 to be between 2.08 and 2.03 ( see figure 5 in @xcite ) . in the experiment the internal absorption @xmath119 was larger than the ones considered in the theoretical calculations",
    "therefore one should expect even smaller theoretical values of the elastic enhancement factor @xmath0 . for comparison , the experimental elastic enhancement factor @xmath0 is scattered between 2.1 and 1.95 .",
    "the elastic enhancement factor @xmath0 was experimentally studied for microwave rectangular and rough cavities simulating partially chaotic , characterised by the transient parameter @xmath1 , and chaotic two - dimensional quantum billiards , respectively .",
