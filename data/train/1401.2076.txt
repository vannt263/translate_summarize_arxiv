    "the charmonium spectrum of @xmath5 states has been enriched with a plethora of new states called @xmath6,@xmath7,@xmath8 states , which do not fit in the expected spectrum of ordinary @xmath9 quark states @xcite .",
    "the theory has followed trend with also a rich offer of possible interpretations , like tetraquarks , or molecular states , and more exotic states @xcite .",
    "one of the last surprises has been the finding of @xmath8 states with isospin @xmath10 . in the hidden charm sector a state around @xmath11 mev , called @xmath12 and a width of about @xmath13 mev has been reported in @xcite , in the @xmath14 reaction , looking at the invariant mass of @xmath15 .",
    "another bes experiment has found a peak in the @xmath16 spectrum close to threshold , which was interpreted in terms of a new resonance with mass around @xmath17 mev and width about @xmath18 mev @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether these two states can be the same , and the quantum numbers are in any case not well determined .",
    "the peak seen in the @xmath16 spectrum is appealing since in @xcite the study of the @xmath0 interaction gave rise to a state with @xmath10 in spin @xmath19 .",
    "the state appeared around @xmath20 mev , with uncertainties .",
    "actually , we will claim here that it should be much less bound , but that most probably it is related to the peak seen in the @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "the threshold for @xmath16 is @xmath21 mev , so a bound state of @xmath0 should have a smaller energy , while the energy of the state is claimed at @xmath17 mev in @xcite .",
    "yet , the interpretation of peaks around threshold is always problematic and a source of confusion .",
    "indeed , most often an enhancement of the invariant mass at threshold is an indication of a bound state or resonance below threshold .",
    "there are multiple examples of it . in a similar reaction , @xmath22 @xcite ,",
    "a bump close to the threshold in the @xmath23 invariant mass distribution was reported by the belle collaboration , which was tentatively interpreted as a new resonance .",
    "this peak was , however , interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of a bound @xmath24 molecular state , called @xmath25 , which had been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and later on has also been reported in other works @xcite . in a similar way , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a peak seen in the @xmath26 threshold in the @xmath27 reaction @xcite was better interpreted as a manifestation of the @xmath28 resonance , below the @xmath26 threshold , which couples strongly to @xmath26 @xcite . more recently",
    "a bump close to threshold in the @xmath29 invariant mass distribution , seen in the @xmath30 decay in ref .",
    "@xcite , is interpreted in @xcite as a signal of the formation of an @xmath31 resonance , predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which couples mostly to the @xmath32 .    in the same direction as in the previous works , in @xcite",
    "the experiment of @xcite was reanalyzed and the enhancement in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution was found compatible with a state with @xmath19 , mass around @xmath33 mev and width around @xmath34 mev , although fits with other solutions were also found acceptable .",
    "yet , resonances with mass bigger than the @xmath0 mass were discouraged based on the difficulty to have single channel resonances with energy above threshold .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that an energy independent potential , smooth in momentum space , could not generate a resonance above the mass of the interacting particles . in this sense ,",
    "any energy below threshold is preferred , and the @xmath19 solution with mass around @xmath33 was proposed as a good candidate to explain the experimental peak .",
    "another reason in favour of this interpretation was that if the state were a @xmath35 produced in @xmath36-wave , as assumed in the experimental work @xcite , it can easily decay into @xmath37 .",
    "this decay channel is the same of the @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however , while a peak is clearly visible in the @xmath37 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath38 , no peak is seen around @xmath17 mev ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present work",
    "we go back to @xcite and perform some corrections to update the results of the local hidden gauge to the results of the heavy quark spin symmetry @xcite . on the other hand we also show how for @xmath10 , the exchange of light @xmath39 states is ozi forbidden , which makes the exchange of light vectors and pseudoscalars cancel when equal masses are taken for them separately , and , because of that , gives a small contribution when real masses are used . in view of this",
    "we explore the exchange of two pions , both with and without interaction .",
    "the exchange of vector mesons is reduced to the exchange of @xmath1 in the @xmath0 diagonal terms , or @xmath2 in the @xmath40 transition , which makes the potential small , in spite of which we still find it bigger than that of the two pion exchange .",
    "altogether we find a state of the @xmath0 in @xmath10 , @xmath19 , close to threshold , which , together with the findings of @xcite , offers a natural interpretation for the peak observed in @xcite .",
    "this molecular interpretation would also be supported by qcd sum rules calculations , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , although the uncertainties between @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev in the binding of these works offers only a weak support to our more precise determination of the mass . at the same time ,",
    "qcd sum rules disfavor the interpretation of the @xmath4 as a possible diquark - antidiquark type vector tetraquark states @xcite .",
    "a molecular interpretation for this state is also assumed in @xcite , where the coupling to the @xmath43 components is evaluated by means of the weinberg compositeness condition @xcite and this picture is used to evaluate various strong decays widths of the resonance .",
    "the growing information around the claimed @xmath4 , together with the present work , comes to support a @xmath0 molecular state below threshold as an interpretation of the @xmath16 peak seen in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we do a thorough investigation of sources of interaction for @xmath0 , beginning with the vector exchange , which involves the exchange of heavy vectors .",
    "then we evaluate the interaction from one meson exchange ( @xmath44 ) , followed by two pion exchange by a different source of interaction , also involving the @xmath44 mesons .",
    "we show that these mechanisms are ozi suppressed and because of this we proceed to evaluate contributions from two pion exchange which are not ozi forbidden .",
    "then we evaluate the crossed two pion exchange and also the exchange of two pions which interact among themselves giving rise to a `` @xmath45 '' exchange .",
    "we show that even if small , the vector exchange is still the leading source of interaction and obtain a barely bound @xmath0 state close to threshold .",
    "we discuss uncertainties in the results and the relationship of the result obtained with the peak observed in @xcite .",
    "we want to study states of @xmath10 .",
    "the first consideration is that one light meson exchange is ozi forbidden . to realize that , we look at the @xmath46 interaction diagram in fig . [",
    "fig : ozi ] and we see that a @xmath47 state exchange is forced to be converted into a @xmath48 state . in terms of physical mesons , that would mean that the @xmath49 , @xmath50 cancel if we take equal masses ( as it is indeed the case in the hidden gauge approach @xcite ) and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 also cancel if equal masses are taken or for large momenta bigger than the mass of the mesons .",
    "we shall show this in detail in subsection [ pseudoscalar ] .",

    ", two different types of interaction can be derived : a contact interaction , coming from the @xmath66 $ ] term , @xmath67 and the three - vector vertex @xmath68 the lagrangian @xmath69 produces the @xmath70 interaction by means of the exchange of one vector meson .",
    "the channels we are interested in are the ones with quantum numbers @xmath10 , charm @xmath55 and strangeness @xmath56 , which are @xmath71 . from the lagrangians in eqs . and , the amplitudes that will be used as the kernel to solve the bethe - salpeter equation can be evaluated .",
    "the reader can find all the details of the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we will only consider the case with @xmath19 since this is the only spin channel where the interaction gives an attractive potential for @xmath72 . in @xcite , in addition to the @xmath73 channel , which is the most important after the @xmath43 , the @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 light vector channels were also considered .",
    "however , the thresholds of these channels are situated at energies much smaller than the mass of the state we are looking for , such that the results would be only slightly affected by their inclusion .",
    "the @xmath73 channel plays an important role in this problem .",
    "indeed , the transition potential of @xmath77 has a strength almost four times bigger than the @xmath72 transition .",
    "the expressions of these potentials are reported in the following equations , including both the contact and the vector - exchange term : @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the masses of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath1 mesons respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath83 , which was used in @xcite , is analogous to the coupling @xmath84 for light mesons , with @xmath85 mev .",
    "however , as we discuss below , we can use constrains of heavy quark spin symmetry to provide a more accurate coupling .    the exercise to relate the @xmath86 vertex to the @xmath87 in @xcite is repeated in that work for the weinberg - tomozawa term that we are considering now , based on the exchange of vector mesons .",
    "the @xmath72 is now mediated by @xmath1 exchange ( @xmath88 ) in analogy to the @xmath89 exchange in @xmath90 . the rules of heavy quark spin symmetry , @xmath91 @xcite , can be obtained from the impulse approximation at the quark level assuming the @xmath92 and @xmath93 as spectators .",
    "then , given the @xmath94 normalization factors of the fields at the meson level , there is a factor @xmath95 between the @xmath96 and the @xmath97 vertices .",
    "since the @xmath97 vertex is proportional to @xmath98 , the @xmath96 will have the same proportionality coefficient multiplied by @xmath99 , which is what the straight application of @xmath100 provides in this case . note that the vector exchange term in eq . at the @xmath43 threshold , for simplicity ,",

    "this should be @xmath105 .",
    "we , thus , use here the normal @xmath84 coupling which is in agreement with the heavy quark spin symmetry . for consistency",
    ", we also take @xmath106 in the contact term , which is smaller than the @xmath1 exchange one , and in the transition potential of eq . .",
    "the use of the new coupling will have as a consequence the reduction of the binding of the @xmath10 state with respect to the one found in @xcite .",

    "note that we take only the crossed diagrams .",
    "the iterated one @xmath51 exchange ( together with @xmath52 and @xmath163 ) , which we saw was ozi suppressed , was already evaluated in section [ iterated ] and we do not consider it .    recalling the expression of the vertices given in eq . , and choosing the momenta assignment as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momenta ] , we can directly write the amplitude of the process as @xmath275    . ]    since the momenta of the particles in the loop are small , we can use the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "the consequence is that only the spatial components of the polarization vectors survive and we can rewrite the amplitude of eq . as @xmath276",
    "we also assume that @xmath277 , such that the dominant term in eq .",
    "is the one with the form @xmath278 .",
    "this means that the amplitude in eq .",

    "[ fig : pions ] .",

    "furthermore , we observe some cancellation between the repulsive one meson exchange of fig . [",

    "[ fig : pions2 ] , and altogether we neglect all the terms coming from pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "in the former section we evaluated the contribution due to vector exchange and pseudoscalar exchange .",

    "this is about @xmath299 mev below the @xmath43 threshold .",
    "the binding is smaller than found in @xcite because we use @xmath84 for the coupling instead of @xmath300 , which we justified from the findings of @xcite .     as a function of @xmath107 . ]",
    "this result is very interesting . indeed , as mentioned in the introduction , in @xcite a peak was seen in the @xmath301 invariant mass spectrum close to the @xmath301 threshold , which was interpreted in @xcite as a signal of a @xmath285 resonance at @xmath17 mev .",
    "however in @xcite it was found that the spectrum could be equally reproduced assuming a @xmath19 resonance below threshold , with a mass around @xmath33 mev and a width of @xmath34 mev .",
    "a fit with about @xmath13 mev less binding and smaller width is also acceptable by looking at the different options discussed in @xcite .",
    "our choice of the parameters is motivated to get a binding similar to that suggested in @xcite but we discuss below our uncertainties .",
    "the finding of the present paper would give support to the interpretation of the results of @xcite as a consequence of an @xmath10 resonance coming from the @xmath43 interaction , with the option suggested in @xcite of a bound @xmath43 state with relatively large width .",
    "we have also evaluated the uncertainties in the results due to the possible contribution of the two pion exchange in the interaction and the pseudoscalar one meson exchange ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath163 ) . as we already mentioned in the beginning of this section , this contribution is small and attractive at small @xmath137 . in order to take it into account",
    ", we increase the magnitude of the vector exchange potential for @xmath72 of eq . and see how the position of the peak changes .",
    "we find that , with an increase in the magnitude of the potential of @xmath302 , the energy of the peak decreases by about @xmath303 mev .",

    "is maintained in the same position using a lower cutoff . in the case of an increase of @xmath306 ( the thin , continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] ) , we need a cutoff of @xmath307 mev , while in the case of @xmath308 ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] ) , @xmath309 mev .",
    "the shape of @xmath291 is slightly changed when going to higher magnitudes , giving a narrower peak and a higher strength .     as a function of @xmath107 for the vector exchange potentials of eq . and ( thick line ) , for an increase of @xmath310 in the vector exchange potential ( thin line ) and for an increase of @xmath308 ( dashed line ) , for a peak at @xmath304 mev . ]",
    "we have taken natural values for @xmath311 , or the cutoff , guided by the results of the analysis of @xcite . yet",
    ", it is interesting to see what happens if we reduce the cutoff . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] we show @xmath291 for different values of the cutoff .",
    "we can see that as @xmath123 decreases , the peak of @xmath291 is moving closer to the threshold and its strength decreases . at @xmath312 mev",
    "we already have a clear cusp and , for lower values of @xmath123 , the cusp remains but the strength of @xmath291 at the peak is very weak and we would no longer be able to produce an enhancement of the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution as seen in the experiment of @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to see that even for values of @xmath313 mev as in @xcite , we still find a state bound by a few mev . on the other hand , bigger values of @xmath123",
    "would produce a too large binding that would contradict the results of the analysis of @xcite .",
    "hence , considering uncertainties in our model , we can say that we are obtaining a bound @xmath43 state or barely bound or even a virtual state ( decaying to @xmath314 ) within @xmath315 mev , with a width of about @xmath316 mev .",
    "note that , even when the pole in the bound region gets close to threshold and disappears , it can get converted into a virtual state with a clearly visible cusp that can be translated into a peak close to threshold in an experimental analysis .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ vector ] , in @xcite also the @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 light vector channels were considered and the @xmath75 and @xmath76 also give some contribution to the width . a slight increase in the value of @xmath317 mev , would be in agreement with the analysis of @xcite where @xmath318 mev .     as a function of @xmath107 , for different values of the cutoff @xmath123 . from up down , @xmath319 mev . ]",
    "we have studied the interaction of @xmath0 in @xmath10 from the perspective of the local hidden gauge approach , extrapolating the model to account for the exchange of heavy vectors .",
    "this is necessary here once we prove that the exchange of light vectors is ozi forbidden in @xmath10 .",
    "the interaction is then weaker than for @xmath320 , where the exchange of light vectors is allowed , but still strong enough to weakly bind the system .",
    "we have also taken into account the coupled channel @xmath321 , which is open for decay and is responsible for a width of the state of the order of @xmath316 mev .",
    "we also mention that the exchange of light @xmath39 is ozi forbidden , which implies that the sum of the exchange of light pseudoscalar mesons also vanishes if the masses of these mesons are taken degenerate . because of that , we study the effect of two pion exchange , with and without interaction , but we find that this contribution is smaller than the exchange of heavy vectors .",
    "the study conducted here complements the one of @xcite where the peak seen in the @xmath0 spectrum in the @xmath322 reaction , that led the experimental team to claim a @xmath35 @xmath4 , was reinterpreted as a possible @xmath323 bound state of @xmath0 with @xmath10 .",
    "both the mass and width that we obtain are compatible with the results obtained in @xcite from a fit to the experimental data , from where we would conclude that the state that we find in our approach can provide a natural explanation of the experimental results of @xcite and one could claim a resonance from this experiment but with a different energy , width ( @xmath324 mev , @xmath317 mev ) and quantum numbers ( @xmath325 , @xmath326 ) .",
