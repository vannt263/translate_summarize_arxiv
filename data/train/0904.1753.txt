    "phase transitions of the universe may give rise to a variety of cosmological relics , such as the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , cosmic magnetic fields @xcite , topological defects @xcite , inhomogeneities @xcite , and gravitational waves @xcite . to be observable , several of these relics depend on the strength of the phase transition .",
    "in a first - order phase transition , bubbles of the stable phase nucleate and grow inside the supercooled phase .",
    "the expansion of bubbles provides a departure from thermal equilibrium , which is generally required to generate cosmological remnants .",
    "the mechanisms of relic generation depend in general on the motion of the bubble walls ( either because they are based on charge transport near the bubble walls , on the collisions of the walls , or on the turbulence they produce ) . as a consequence ,",
    "an important parameter in the generating mechanisms is the velocity of bubble expansion .",
    "for some relics , higher velocities give a stronger effect .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , of gravitational waves . in other cases , on the contrary , the amplitude or abundance of the relic peaks at some value of the bubble wall velocity .",
    "this happens for instance in the case of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "a first - order phase transition requires the system to have two phases with different equation of state ( eos ) , which coexist in some temperature range .",
    "thus , the high - temperature phase has a pressure @xmath0 , and the low - temperature phase has a pressure @xmath1 . at the critical temperature @xmath2 ,",
    "the two phases have the same pressure but different entropy and energy .",
    "the entropy density is given by @xmath3 , where a prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath4 , and the energy density is given by @xmath5 .",
    "the latent heat @xmath6 is defined as the difference between the energy densities of the two phases at @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , all these quantities can be derived from the free energy density @xmath10 by the relation @xmath11 .    in a finite temperature field theory",
    ", we have in general a scalar field @xmath12 , the higgs field , which plays the role of an order parameter for the phase transition .",
    "we shall assume this is the case , although most of our conclusions will be independent of this assumption .",
    "the free energy density is the finite temperature effective potential , which is a function of @xmath12 and @xmath4 . in some range of temperatures ,",
    "the free energy has two minima separated by a barrier .",
    "the value of @xmath12 in each minimum defines the two phases .",
    "we shall assume that the high - temperature minimum is @xmath13 , and the low temperature minimum has a value @xmath14 , which is the case for a symmetry breaking phase transition . a phase transition with a large value of the order parameter",
    ", @xmath15 is usually called a strongly first - order phase transition .",
    "thus , we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 . below the critical temperature ,",
    "the transition from @xmath13 to @xmath18 occurs via the nucleation of bubbles @xcite .",
    "a bubble is a configuration @xmath19 of the field .",
    "we shall make the usual assumption that this configuration is a thin - walled sphere .",
    "a nucleated bubble grows because @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the propagation of bubble walls in cosmological phase transitions has been extensively investigated . in general , the stronger the phase transition , the larger the amount of supercooling .",
    "therefore , one expects that the velocity of bubble walls will be larger for stronger phase transitions .",
    "indeed , the pressure difference which pushes the wall of a bubble , @xmath22 , grows as the temperature decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity depends also on the friction of the wall with the medium and the latent heat that is released at the phase transition front .",
    "the friction is related to the _ microphysics _ ,",
    "i.e. , to the interactions of particles of the medium with the higgs field in the configuration of the wall , whereas the latent heat is involved in the _ hydrodynamics _ , i.e. , the bulk motions and reheating of the fluid near the wall .    according to hydrodynamics ,",
    "there are two kinds of steady state solutions for the propagation of the wall , namely , detonations and deflagrations .",
    "detonations are supersonic while deflagrations are generally subsonic .",
    "each solution has different boundary conditions , and both may appear in a given model and may even coexist in some range of parameters .",
    "a numerical calculation of the evolution of the field @xmath23 @xcite , suggests that the bubbles grow typically as subsonic deflagrations , although , in some regions of parameter space , the solutions switch from deflagrations to detonations , as the friction is decreased . in view of the cosmological consequences of the phase transition , it is important to determine the range of parameters where each solution may exist .",
    "hydrodynamic considerations give general constraints on the allowed regions of thermodynamic parameters , but the existence of deflagrations and detonations depends strongly on the value of the friction .    the literature on the subject of the bubble wall velocity can be roughly divided in two groups : those papers which calculate the friction for a given model , assuming nonrelativistic deflagrations and ignoring hydrodynamics @xcite , and those which consider hydrodynamics , but they either disregard microphysics or include the friction as a free parameter @xcite . as a consequence , the analytical approximations that are most commonly used in applications , were derived ignoring either microphysics or hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed , in the context of baryogenesis the wall velocity is assumed to be of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a friction coefficient .",
    "this is a nonrelativistic approximation ( thus appropriate for the case of deflagrations ) which neglects hydrodynamics . in the context of gravitational waves , on the contrary ,",
    "the wall is assumed to propagate as a detonation , and the so called chapman - jouguet hypothesis is further assumed , leading to a simple expression for the velocity , which depends only on the ratio between the latent heat and the thermal energy density of the plasma .    the aim of this paper is to calculate the wall velocity in both cases , detonations and deflagrations , taking the friction into account .",
    "this will allow us to investigate under which conditions the various hydrodynamic solutions can exist , and to explore how these conditions are attained in a physical model .",
    "for these purposes , we shall first consider the equations for the discontinuity of the fluid variables across the wall , together with a simple parametrization of the friction force ( which consists in introducing a damping term in the equation for the field @xmath12 ) and a simple model ( the bag equation of state ) for the phase transition .",
    "these simplifications permit to write down a complete set of equations , which can be solved for the wall velocity as a function of three parameters , namely , @xmath26 , where @xmath6 is the latent heat and @xmath27 is the thermal energy density of the high - temperature phase , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the temperature at which bubbles nucleate , and @xmath30 , where @xmath25 is the friction coefficient .",
    "solving numerically these equations , we shall determine the regions in the space of the aforementioned parameters for which deflagrations and detonations may or may not exist . in order to apply the results to a physical model , we choose as an example the electroweak phase transition in an extension of the standard model ( sm ) with scalar singlets , which provides a simple variation of the strength of the phase transition as a function of the fundamental parameters .",
    "for this specific model , we compute the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath30 and we calculate the wall velocity . to estimate the value of the parameter @xmath25 , we shall relate our parametrization of the friction to the microphysics calculations that exist in the literature . for the nucleation temperature @xmath33 , we solve numerically the bounce action to obtain the nucleation rate .",
    "we shall also find analytical approximations for both propagation modes .",
    "in particular , we give a simple approximation for the detonation solution , which depends on the friction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ eqs ]",
    "we write down the equations for the wall velocity , the fluid variables , and the friction for both propagation modes . in section [ nume ]",
    "we show the numerical results for the wall velocity as a function of the relevant parameters , and we determine regions in parameter space where each kind of solution may or may not exist . in section [ model ] we consider a specific model , for which we compute the values of the latent heat @xmath6 , the friction @xmath25 , and the nucleation temperature @xmath33 , and we calculate the detonation and deflagration velocities ( when they exist ) as functions of the fundamental parameters of the model .",
    "finally , in section [ aprox ] we consider analytical approximations for the wall velocity .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ conclu ] .",
    "to take into account hydrodynamics and microphysics in the calculation of the wall velocity , three basic ingredients are needed , namely , the continuity conditions that relate the fluid variables across the wall discontinuity , an equation of state , which relates the various fluid variables on each side of the phase transition front , and an equation for the effect of friction on the motion of the wall .      in the rest frame of the phase - transition front , we have an incoming flow in the high - temperature phase , with velocity @xmath34 , and an outgoing flow in the low - temperature phase , with velocity @xmath35 ( see fig . [ detodefla ] ) .",
    "the motion of the wall causes the temperatures @xmath36 and @xmath37 on each side to be different .",
    "the continuity conditions for energy and momentum fluxes give two equations @xcite , @xmath38where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the enthalpy density .",
    "equivalently , we have @xmath41which can be readily solved for the velocities in terms of the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "notice that these two equations have four unknowns , namely , the velocities @xmath42 and the temperatures @xmath43 on both sides of the wall .",
    "all other thermodynamical quantities are determined by the equation of state . in principle",
    ", the temperature @xmath36 of the supercooled phase can be calculated using the nucleation rate . to determine completely the system , one more equation is needed .",
    "this can be obtained from a microscopic calculation of the friction of the wall with the plasma .",
    "the above equations admit two kinds of solutions , one of them with @xmath44 , called detonation , and the other with @xmath45 , called deflagration ( fig .",
    "[ detodefla ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by using a simple model in which the low - temperature eos is that of radiation , @xmath46 , and the high - temperature eos is that of radiation plus vacuum energy , i.e. , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqlandau ] ) or ( [ vlandau ] ) one obtains @xcite @xmath49where @xmath50 . the solutions with the plus and the minus signs correspond to detonations and to deflagrations , respectively .",
    "we plot both in fig .",
    "[ figvmavme ] for a given value of @xmath51 .",
    "it turns out that , for a detonation , we have @xmath52 , and for a deflagration , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the speed of sound on each side of the wall . for the above simple equations of state , the speed of sound in both phases is that of a relativistic plasma , @xmath55 .    in the reference frame where the matter far in front of the bubble wall is at rest and the wall moves , the matter at the center of the bubble ( far behind the wall )",
    "must be also at rest . as a consequence ,",
    "a single front ( the phase transition front ) is not sufficient to satisfy all the boundary conditions . as a result , it turns out that a deflagration front must be preceded by a shock front ( fig .",
    "[ figperfil ] , left ) . between the shock and the deflagration fronts ,",
    "the matter is compressed and has a finite velocity . outside this region",
    "the matter is at rest . on the other hand",
    ", a detonation front hits fluid which is at rest , the density increases suddenly , and the phase transition front is followed by a rarefaction wave ( fig .",
    "[ figperfil ] , right ) . comparing with the reference frame of the wall",
    ", we see that the deflagration wall velocity is given by @xmath56 , while the detonation wall velocity is given by @xmath57 according to the inequalities above , a detonation is always supersonic , @xmath58 a deflagration may in principle be supersonic or subsonic ( it _ is _ subsonic with respect to the fluid in front of it , which is moving in the direction of the wall ) .      depending on the velocity @xmath35 of the outflow ,",
    "deflagrations are divided into weak ( @xmath59 ) , jouguet ( @xmath60 ) and strong ( @xmath61 ) deflagrations .",
    "thus , strong deflagrations are supersonic , and weak deflagrations are subsonic .",
    "detonations are also classified into strong ( @xmath62 ) , jouguet ( @xmath60 ) , and weak ( @xmath63 ) detonations . since the incoming flow is supersonic , strong detonations perturb the fluid more strongly than weak detonations .",
    "the various kinds of solutions have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "using thermodynamical arguments , one can find regions in parameter space where each solution is allowed .",
    "in particular , the non - negativity of entropy production may rule out the whole family of detonations or deflagrations @xcite . however , such arguments do not rule out a particular type ( i.e. , weak , jouguet , or strong ) of detonation or deflagration @xcite . in the case of deflagrations , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that strong deflagrations are mechanically unstable , although in principle there is no physical reason against their existence .",
    "a special type of supersonic jouguet deflagration , which is followed by a rarefaction wave , was shown to exist in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of detonations",
    ", it is known @xcite that , for the case of chemical burning , detonation bubbles can only grow as jouguet detonations .",
    "remarkably , this condition ( which is referred to as the chapman - jouguet hypothesis ) means that a microscopic calculation of the wall velocity is irrelevant , since the system is completely determined by the energy - momentum conservation and the boundary conditions . in ref . @xcite it was argued that the chapman - jouguet hypothesis should be valid also for cosmological phase transitions . setting @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ steinhardt ] ) leads to a very simple formula @xmath65 for the wall velocity .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in contrast to the case of chemical burning , the chapman - jouguet hypothesis does not hold in the case of phase transitions .",
    "it was also shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that strong detonations are impossible , since they can not satisfy the boundary condition of a vanishing fluid velocity at some point behind the bubble wall . nevertheless , weak detonations are possible , and the velocity will be determined in general by microscopical processes .",
    "thus , in a realistic model the detonation velocity will depend on a friction parameter @xmath66 as well as on the hydrodynamic parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the wall velocity will always satisfy the condition @xmath68 ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figvmavme ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath69 may give the jouguet result only in some limiting cases .",
    "it is well known that , if the supercooling is not considerable and the friction is large enough , the bubbles will grow as deflagrations , whereas detonations demand small values of the friction and more extreme conditions ( i.e. , strong supercooling ) @xcite .",
    "it is often argued , though , that the propagation of the deflagration wall becomes turbulent and eventually turns into a detonation due to shape instabilities of the wall . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the qcd phase transition and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the electroweak phase transition , small wavelength perturbations of the deflagration front are stabilized by the interface tension , while large ones grow exponentially .",
    "however , a more detailed study @xcite shows that the strong dependence of the wall velocity on temperature actually stabilizes the large scale perturbations .",
    "the stability of the deflagration front thus depends on several quantities ( these are essentially the latent heat , the value of the wall velocity and its dependence on temperature ) .",
    "it was found , in particular , that the deflagration front is stable under perturbations _ at all scales _ for velocities above a certain critical value @xmath70 .",
    "for instance , in the ( unrealistic ) case of the minimal standard model with a higgs mass @xmath71 , the critical velocity is @xmath72 @xcite . below this velocity ,",
    "perturbations are unstable on scales larger than a critical scale @xmath73 . however , depending on the parameters , the value of @xmath74 may be much larger than the size of bubbles . furthermore , the characteristic time for the growth of the instabilities may be larger than the duration of the phase transition .",
    "therefore , in the general case , the deflagration front will be probably stable .",
    "a study of the hydrodynamical stability of bubble growth is beyond the scope of this paper .      in any case , it is clear that the determination of the wall velocity requires additional input . to consider the effect of friction together with the fluid equations ( [ eqlandau ] ) , it is customary to introduce a damping term of the typical form @xmath75 in the equation of motion for the higgs field @xcite , @xmath76here , the dimensionless damping coefficient @xmath77 is a free parameter .",
    "nevertheless , we can relate @xmath77 to the actual friction coefficient obtained from microscopical calculations in a specific model , as we shall see in section [ paramfric ] . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider a planar wall moving along the @xmath78 axis . in the frame of the wall we have @xmath79where @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the fluid velocity in the @xmath78 direction .",
    "multiplying by @xmath82 and integrating over @xmath83 , the first term disappears . then , _ if we neglect the variation of temperature with @xmath78 _ , the fluid velocity is @xmath84 , and we obtain @xmath85where @xmath86 ^{2}dz\\]]is the surface tension of the bubble wall .",
    "equation ( [ eqvwold ] ) gives the well known nonrelativistic approximation for the wall velocity @xmath87where @xmath88and @xmath89 is the free energy density difference @xmath90 , which gives the pressure difference @xmath91 between the two phases .",
    "if we now take into account hydrodynamics , we can still integrate eq .",
    "( eqfieta ) , but we can not ignore the fact that the temperature and velocity of the fluid depend on @xmath78 . before multiplying by @xmath92 and integrating , we use the equation @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "then , proceeding as before , we obtain @xmath94 ^{2}u\\left ( z\\right ) dz=0.\\]]the first two terms are just @xmath95 .",
    "to simplify the calculations , some approximations are necessary . in the first integral , the function @xmath96 varies from @xmath97to @xmath98(we have used the fact that @xmath99 and 0 are minima of @xmath10 ) .",
    "if @xmath100 and @xmath101 change smoothly , we expect that a linear function will give a good approximation to the integrand @xmath102 inside the thin wall . therefore , the integral yields @xmath103 .",
    "for the second integral , it is a good approximation to assume that @xmath104 is symmetric around the center of the wall at @xmath105 ; hence , this can be approximated by @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "hence , we have @xmath107where @xmath108 as before .",
    "notice that the approximations we have made to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eqmicro ] ) do not involve any assumption on the wall velocity nor on the equation of state .",
    "hence , this equation can be used for the treatment of relativistic as well as nonrelativistic velocities , and is model - independent .",
    "provided the various thermodynamical quantities are related by means of an equation of state , eqs .",
    "( [ eqlandau ] ) and ( [ eqmicro ] ) can be solved to obtain the velocities @xmath35 and @xmath34 as functions of the temperature @xmath36 in front of the wall .",
    "the result will depend on parameters of the theory that appear in the eos , such as the latent heat , and on the friction coefficient . in practice",
    ", however , it is very difficult to solve these equations unless we use a simple model .",
    "as we have seen , the relation ( [ steinhardt ] ) between @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ eqlandau ] ) , using the relations @xmath109for the low - t phase , and @xmath110for the high - t phase . in order to obtain a second relation between @xmath111 and @xmath112 from eq .",
    "( [ eqmicro ] ) , the eos for each phase has to be more specific .",
    "the _ thermal _ energy densities @xmath113 and @xmath114 must be of the form @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom . hence , the simplest possibility is to assume that both phases have the same @xmath118 .",
    "such a simple model was considered in ref .",
    "this model , however , fails to describe a realistic phase transition if the vacuum energy @xmath119 is a constant .",
    "indeed , the critical temperature is defined as that @xmath4 at which the pressures of the two phases are equal , @xmath120 . however , with @xmath121 and @xmath122 we have @xmath123 at any @xmath4 .",
    "this would be possible if @xmath119 were a function of @xmath4 . with @xmath124 constant",
    ", this model does not have a critical temperature .",
    "the existence of a critical temperature @xmath2 , below which bubbles nucleate and grow , constitutes an important distinction between the case of a phase transition and that of chemical burning . in a phase transition",
    ", supercooling is needed for bubbles to grow . in the first place ,",
    "the temperature must _ decrease sufficiently _ below @xmath2 so that bubbles nucleate . in the second place , even if for some reason ( e.g. , by means of inhomogeneous nucleation ) bubbles nucleate at @xmath7 , the condition @xmath21 is still necessary to achieve a pressure difference @xmath20 , so that bubbles can grow . in the case of chemical burning , the speed of the reaction increases with temperature , and the temperature must _ rise sufficiently _ for the combustion to proceed .",
    "if the reaction is strongly exothermic , it is sufficient to rise the temperature at a single point .",
    "the heat that is released by the reaction at that point rises the temperature of the surrounding gas , and the reaction may extend over the whole gas @xcite . as a consequence , the higher the released energy , the larger the velocity of the combustion front . in the case of a phase transition ,",

    "we have @xmath135from which we obtain the latent heat@xmath136 in fact , in a realistic model , the vacuum energy density does not vanish immediately after the phase transition .",

    "hence , @xmath172 has a lower bound larger than @xmath171 ( except in the limit @xmath375 ) .",
    "this divergence reflects the fact that a certain amount of supercooling is always needed for detonations to exist . as a consequence",

    "( [ ultra ] ) that @xmath377 decreases .",
    "this is because increasing @xmath6 strengthens the effect of hydrodynamics , which is to slow - down the wall .",
    "taking the limit of large @xmath6 is not very useful . in the first place , @xmath6 is bounded by @xmath378 ( we remark that this is a general thermodynamical constraint @xcite ) .",
    "hence , this limit corresponds to taking @xmath379 ( or @xmath380 ) .",
    "however , this is the limit of an extremely strong phase transition which , in a realistic model will have also @xmath381 ( or @xmath382 ) .",

    "( [ ultra ] ) , since the bag model does not provide a way to calculate the nucleation temperature @xmath158 .    on the other hand",
    ", we can consider the limit @xmath385 . in this case both @xmath171 and @xmath386 , ( unless @xmath387 , which will not be the case in a realistic model if @xmath6 is small ) .",

    "( [ eos]-[leps ] ) , we see that @xmath389 .",

    "vanishes ; the velocity will not necessarily be large , nor the approximation break - down .",
    "this reflects the fact that hydrodynamics slows down the motion of the bubble wall . for @xmath385 , i.e. , @xmath413 , we obtain , similarly to the detonation case , @xmath414 , which corresponds to neglecting hydrodynamics .",
    "it is interesting to consider also , without neglecting hydrodynamics , the case in which @xmath334 is small , i.e , the limit of small supercooling .      in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "the pressure difference @xmath415 is @xmath416 .",
    "this can be seen already from the nonrelativistic version of eqs .",
    "( [ eqlandau ] ) , @xmath417 on the other hand , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqmicro ] ) , the temperature difference @xmath418 is @xmath419 .",
    "we shall now consider the case in which @xmath66 is not too small , so that the temperature difference must be @xmath420 .",
    "this means that , to order @xmath69 , the pressure difference due to supercooling , @xmath421 , is canceled by the pressure difference due to the temperature gradient , @xmath422 .",
    "hence , the differences @xmath423 must be also @xmath424 . thus , in this case we can expand the thermodynamic quantities to first order in @xmath425 .",
    "in particular , for the pressure functions we have @xmath426 , which can be used instead of the equations of state ( [ eos ] ) .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath427where @xmath428 and @xmath429 are evaluated at @xmath141 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath430to first order in @xmath431 we neglect the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqmicro ] ) and , inserting eq .",
    "( [ lineal ] ) in the second term , we obtain @xmath432where we have used @xmath433 and @xmath434 , with @xmath435 .",
    "if we had @xmath436 this would only give a correction of a factor @xmath437 to the usual equation @xmath438 .",
    "however , an important contribution comes from the fluid that is accumulated in front of the moving wall . for @xmath36 and @xmath439 the relation ( [ amndefla ] ) between the nucleation temperature @xmath158 and that of the reheated fluid @xmath36 is given by @xmath440where the enthalpy @xmath441",
    "is evaluated at @xmath141 .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath442which agrees with the result of ref .",
    "comparing with eq .",
    "( [ vwmicro ] ) and taking into account that @xmath443 , we may write @xmath444where the effective friction coefficient @xmath445 includes the effects of hydrodynamics .",
    "if friction dominates , i.e. , if @xmath446 , we obtain @xmath447 . for @xmath448 , we have @xmath449 , and we recover eq .",
    "( [ vwmicro ] ) . in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath450 , we still obtain a finite velocity @xmath451 .",
    "again , this means that the latent heat that is accumulated in front of the bubble wall slows down the motion of the wall .    in fig .",
    "[ figaproxdef ] we plot the two approximations for deflagrations , together with the numerical result and the usual approximation which neglects hydrodynamics .",
    "as expected , the numerical calculation gives smaller values of @xmath69 than the analytical approximations , since the exact velocity has an upper bound , namely , the speed of light .",
    "we see that in general the nonrelativistic approximation is quite good up to @xmath452 , and breaks down for @xmath453 .",
    "notice that a useful , rough approximation consists of assuming that @xmath69 is given by , say , eq .",
    "( [ vwnr ] ) up to @xmath454 , and by @xmath454 when eq .",
    "( [ vwnr ] ) becomes supersonic .",
    "we have studied the steady state velocity of bubble walls in first - order cosmological phase transitions .",
    "we have numerically investigated the whole velocity range @xmath455 , and we have found analytic approximations for the limits @xmath456 and @xmath457 .",
    "thus , we have considered both detonations and deflagrations .",
    "we have derived a relatively simple set of equations for the wall velocity and the fluid variables on both sides of the wall . to obtain these equations",
    "we have used three ingredients , namely , the continuity conditions for the fluid variables at the phase transition front ( and at the shock front in the case of deflagrations ) , the introduction of a damping term in the equation of motion for the order parameter ( higgs field ) , and the bag equation of state .",
    "the parametrization of the friction provides a model - independent equation which involves a friction parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we obtained this equation by generalizing a procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of nonrelativistic velocities and small supercooling .",
    "we have also shown how to calculate the parameter @xmath25 in a specific model .",
    "we have solved numerically these equations for the wall velocity as a function of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath30 which depend essentially on the latent heat @xmath6 , the nucleation temperature @xmath33 , and the friction coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "we have studied the regions in parameter space where detonations and deflagrations are possible , and we have also considered a specific model ( the standard model with extra singlet scalar fields ) to investigate how a physical case moves about through these regions .",
    "we have found that supersonic velocities ( either detonations or deflagrations ) are in general obtained only for very strong phase transitions , with @xmath458 , occurring in the model for relatively large values of the number of scalar singlets @xmath117 and of their coupling @xmath311 to the higgs .",
    "besides , the existence of detonations requires relatively low values of the friction , and it may happen that for such strong phase transitions neither detonations nor deflagrations exist .",
    "in such a case , the steady state can not be reached , and the wall will accelerate until bubbles collide . the case in which the wall velocity gets close to the speed of light before bubble collision may have important implications for gravitational wave generation .",
    "interestingly , this ultrarelativistic situation has been considered very recently @xcite for the sm extension with singlet scalar fields , finding that such `` runaway '' solutions exist for very strong phase transitions .    in a more general extension of the sm",
    ", the singlets may have a @xmath12-independent mass term , which will weaken the phase transition .",
    "in that case , detonations may not appear at all .",
    "the inclusion of fermions in the model will also weaken the phase transition , but the friction coefficient will not have the infrared contribution and will be smaller . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we shall investigate several extensions of the sm , including the mssm and an extension with strongly coupled fermions @xcite .",
    "finally , we have discussed the validity of commonly used analytical approximations for the wall velocity , and we have obtained nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic approximations . in particular , we have shown that the jouguet velocity gives a really bad approximation to detonations ; the actual detonation velocity is quite larger .",
    "we have found an alternative approximation ( [ ultra ] ) which , besides being more realistic , is quite simple and gives an excellent fit to the numerical result .",
