    "in the frame of hierarchical clustering scenario , galaxy clusters grow in size by merging with subunits , with each major merger event lasting for @xmath5 gyr ( e.g. roettiger , loken & burns 1997 ; ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ; poole et al .",
    "in such major mergers both ram pressure stripping and slingshot can generate remarkable x - ray substructures in gas density and temperature distributions , which are often accompanied by shocks and/or cold fronts that exhibit arc - shaped or edge - like morphologies ( e.g. markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "these substructures are expected to contain valuable information not only on merger dynamics itself , but also on thermal and chemical evolutions of the hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , which helps understand the nature of dark matter ( markevitch et al .",

    "theoretical studies and numerical n - body simulations ( e.g. roettiger et al . 1997 ; ricker 1998 ; poole et al .",

    "the derived @xmath10 ( up to about 4 gyr in some cases ) is much longer than the lifetimes of shocks and cold fronts , since shocks and cold fronts are usually smeared out quickly on dynamic time - scales characterized by the sound crossing time .",
    "actually , high - quality _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations have shown that in merging clusters there is a prevailing existence of massive , off - centre cool gas clumps , which are about @xmath11 kpc in size , reside within the central ( @xmath12600 kpc ) region of the cluster , and possess an average temperature @xmath13 kev lower than the ambient gas .    in 1e @xmath14 ( the bullet cluster ;",

    "2003 ) , abell 2065 ( chatzikos , sarazin & kempner 2006 ) , and abell 2255 ( sakelliou & ponman 2006 ) , the off - centre cool gas clump is not escorted by either a shock or a cold front . however ,",
    "unambiguous evidence obtained in radio , optical , and x - ray bands still indicates that the cool gas clump was driven out of the core region of either the main cluster ( abell 754 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2003 ; henry , finoguenov & briel 2004 ) or the infalling sub - cluster by the merger .",
    "in fact , the off - centre cool gas clumps in above two types of clusters share many similarities in terms of their sizes , locations , and gas masses ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore , an interesting question arises : can the appearance of such massive , off - centre cool gas clumps be safely used to diagnose the dynamical state of a cluster , even when there is a lack of violent merger signatures , such as prominent shocks , cold fronts , and other associated radio / optical substructures ?",

    "the second luminous member pgc 13679 ( s0 , @xmath25 @xmath20 ) is located at about 417.8@xmath26 kpc southeast of the central galaxy pair , and dominates a local sub - cluster whose recessional velocity is about 1 300 km s@xmath2 larger than the mean recessional velocity of the main cluster ( 17 500 km s@xmath2 ; lucey et al .",

    "( 2009 ) . in the calculation",
    "only the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic datasets are used , because the data statistics of the _ chandra _ acis datasets is not good enough for us to map the temperature distribution . to be specific",
    ", we first define about 4000 cells in the @xmath70 mpc@xmath71 mpc region , whose centres ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) are randomly distributed with a separation of @xmath75 between the centres of any two adjacent cells .",
    "each cell is apportioned with an adaptive radius of @xmath76 , so that it encloses @xmath77 photons in @xmath78 kev after the point sources are excluded .",

    "the redshift and absorption are fixed to @xmath17 and the galactic value @xmath79 @xmath80 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , respectively .",
    "after the obtained best - fit gas temperature is assigned to the corresponding cell ( @xmath81 ) , and this process is repeated for all cells , we calculate the projected temperature at any position @xmath82 as @xmath83}/\\sum_{{\\bf r}_{i}}{g_{{\\bf r}_{i}}(r_{{\\bf r , r}_{i}})},~r_{{\\bf r , r}_{i}}<s({\\bf r}_{i})\\\\\\ ] ] ( gu et al .",

    "we find that , despite the relatively regular appearance of the x - ray images ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the spectral distribution of the projected gas temperature is highly asymmetric , inferring that the cluster has not recovered from a violent event on cluster scales . in particular",

    "most interestingly , the west boundary of the cool gas clump coincides with the bow edge perfectly , indicating that they are likely to have the same origin .    to clarify the significance of the existence of the cool gas clump , we define four sector regions in fig .",
    "@xmath90 , two of which have the same angles as those defined earlier in fig .",
    "@xmath54 , and divide each of these sector regions into a series of wider partial elliptical annuli .",

    "each group of spectra are fitted simultaneously with the same model parameters , except for that the normalizations are left free .",
    "the derived projected temperature profiles in the four sectors are plotted in fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ temperatures are consistent with each other ( 68% confidence level ) , and in the west sector the temperature in @xmath98 kpc ( @xmath99 kev ) , where the cool gas clump is located , is lower than those of the adjacent regions at 68% confidence level ( see also table 2 ) ; no such temperature drop is found in other three directions .",
    "this is further confirmed by the results of the deprojected analysis of the _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra for the west sector ( table 2 and fig .",
    "@xmath100 ) , which shows that the gas temperature of the cool gas clump ( @xmath101 kev for w2 region ) is actually lower than those of the innermost region ( @xmath102 kev for w1 region ) and the next outer region ( @xmath103 kev for w3 region ) at the @xmath104 confidence level , and can not be ascribed to the uncertainties in determining the metal abundance .      to study the nature of the cool gas clump , we carry out a simple hydrodynamic study to determine the velocity of the edge in the environment .",

    "following vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we use the best - fit gas densities across the edge ( eq.(4 ) ) and gas temperatures for w2 and w3 regions (  3.2 and fig .",

    "after the model fitting of this distribution is finished , we also attempt to investigate the 2-dimensional spatial distribution of the galaxies in the high - velocity plateau .",

    "these results suggest that the galaxy velocity separation ( fig .",
    "@xmath120 ; see also smith et al .",
    "2004 ) has a dynamical nature , which is most likely to be a major merger , with a merger mass ratio of about @xmath134 , as estimated from the velocity variance ratio ( @xmath135 ) and the galaxy number ratio ( @xmath136 ) of the two subgroups .    in literature",
    "abell 3158 was classified as a ` single - component ' and ` relaxed ' system ( kolokotronis et al .",

    "2006 ) , which possesses a relatively regular morphology in the x - ray band ( ku et al . 1983 ; mohr et al . 1999 ; schuecker et al .",
    ". however , considering none of violent merger signatures is detected in the cluster , the existence of the high - velocity subgroup indicates that the cluster is evolving into the late stage of a major merger event .",
    "this may explain the origin of the off - centre cool gas clump detected in the west sector region , which is moving at a subsonic velocity (  3.2@xmath483.3 ; see also  5.1 ) .",
    "the most prominent x - ray feature detected in abell 3158 is the massive , off - centre cool gas clump , which is moving behind a * faint * cold front .",

    "2005 ; nulsen et al .",
    "2002 ) , which are usually tightly associated with the low - density regions such as the agn - induced radio lobes and x - ray cavities , since no evidence for agn activity and its remnants has been reported in abell 3158 according to the existing multi - band observations .",
    "in such a sense , we speculate that the cool clump was formed either by the inhomogeneous radiative cooling in the icm , or by the ram pressure stripping or slingshot during a merger event . the first possibility can be ruled out immediately , because given the best - fit spectral parameters for the cool clump , the radiative cooling time of the gas in the clump ( cf .",
    "sarazin 1986 ) is @xmath137 where continuum and line emissions are both included .",
    "this is close to the hubble time ( @xmath138 gyr ) of the cluster , and is significantly longer than the coulomb conduction time @xmath139 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2003 ) , where @xmath140 kpc is the linear scale of the cool clump , @xmath141 kev is the average gas temperature for the cluster s central 200@xmath26 kpc ( @xmath142 ) region .",
    "if the conduction is suppressed by a factor of @xmath143 due to the tangled magnetic field in the icm ( e.g. narayan & medvedev 2001 ; zakamska & narayan 2003 ; chandran & maron 2004 ) , the effective conduction time increases to @xmath144 gyr .",
    "consequently , even if the cool gas clump was formed through radiative cooling , it would have been destroyed very quickly by conduction , which indicates that the cool gas clump is most likely caused by merger .",

    "3@xmath146 ) , and has a constant density , the gas mass is estimated to be about @xmath147 @xmath16 .",
    "this value is comparable to masses of the off - centre cool clumps identified in other merging clusters , which range from about @xmath148 @xmath16 to @xmath149 @xmath16 ( table 3 ) .",
    "it also falls into the gas mass range of the cool - core regions of poor clusters and massive groups ( e.g. mulchaey et al . 1996 ; gastaldello et al . 2007 ;",
    "baldi et al .",
    "in fact , as shown in table 3 , not only the gas mass , but also the size , temperature gradient , and the relatively high metal abundance of the cool clump in abell 3158 resemble those of other off - centre cool clumps detected in 1e @xmath14 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) , abell 754 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2003 ) , abell 2065 ( chatzikos et al .",
    "2006 ) , abell 2255 ( sakelliou & ponman 2006 ) , abell 2256 ( sun et al .",
    "2002 ) , and abell 3667 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "note that most of the off - centre cool clumps in these merging systems are considered to be the remnant of the cool - core of either the main cluster or the infalling sub - cluster . based on all these similarities",
    ", it is natural to speculate that the cool gas clump in abell 3158 was formed by the ram pressure stripping or slingshot during a merger event .",
    "the above speculation is enhanced by the study of the correlation between gas temperature and entropy , which is defined as @xmath150 in terms of gas temperature @xmath151 and density @xmath7 . by quoting the data of zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and sanderson , osullivan & ponman ( 2009 ) , we re - calculate the redshift - corrected gas entropy at @xmath152 ( @xmath153 is the radius at which the mean over - density is 500 with respect to the critical density of the universe ) for a sample of 13 cool - core clusters and a sample of 19 non - cool - core clusters .",
    "we also calculate the gas entropy of the seven cool gas clumps listed in table 3 .",
    "the entropy - temperature distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "6 , where the strong correlations for the cool - core and non - cool - core clusters are characterized by two power - law models , respectively ( sanderson et al .",
    "it can be clearly seen that cool gas clumps in abell 3158 and most of other merging clusters follow the relation for cool - core clusters , which reveals their nature as cool - core remnants .",
    "note that the gas entropy of the cool clump in 1e 0657 - 56 is significantly below the relation for cool - core clusters at least 1@xmath154 limit ( fig .",
    "6 ) , which is possibly due to that the cool clump is compressed extremely as it experiences the ram pressure stripping force and passes through the deep potential of the main cluster during this drastic high - velocity merger event ( markevitch et al . 2002 ) .    based on above data analysis , calculations , and discussions",
    ", we propose that the appearance of the massive off - centre cool gas clumps can be regarded as a robust diagnostic of merger state .",
    "combining the study of cold fronts ( e.g. owers et al . 2009 ) , which survive longer than the shocks , with the study of such cool gas clumps , we may be able to place tight constraints on the merger history .      in abell 3158 , the x - ray bow edge of the faint cold front is pointing towards west in projection (  3.1@xmath483.3 ) , which indicates that the symmetrical axis of the merging process is reasonably close to the west - east direction , although the projected effect lowers the detectability of the edge .",
    "the direction is also roughly consistent with the extending direction of the three cd galaxies ( fig .",
    "1@xmath146 ) , as well as the galaxy distribution of the high - velocity subgroup ( fig .",
    "5@xmath155 ) .",
    "straightforwardly , the high - velocity subgroup has already made its closest approach to the core of the main cluster roughly from east to west . in this scenario ,",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the moving velocity of the cool gas clump ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ;  3.3 ) and the relative line - of - sight velocity of the high - velocity subgroup ( 1740@xmath156 km s@xmath2 ;  4 ) demonstrates the gas component of the high - velocity subgroup possibly has been significantly slowed by the ram pressure stripping force . regarding the late stage of the major merger (  4 ) ,",
    "perhaps the high - velocity subgroup is in its second core passage . on the other hand , because the three cd galaxies all lie well behind the cold front ( fig .",
    "1@xmath146 ) , perhaps the cluster is in another merging scenario , in which the cool gas clump has been slingshot out from the centre of the main cluster , as expected after core passage , although the optical centroid of the high - velocity subgroup is not behind the faint cold front edge .",
    "by analysing the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data of the nearby galaxy cluster abell 3158 , we identify a massive , off - centre cool gas clump , which is moving at a velocity of @xmath3 , toward west on the sky plane behind a faint cold front .",
    "the possibilities of this substructure being formed by inhomogeneous radiative cooling and by central agn activity are excluded .",
    "based on the results obtained in the x - ray and optical analysis , we speculate that the cool gas clump is the remnant of the original central cool - core of the main cluster or the infalling sub - cluster during a major merger event .",
    "this case shows that the appearance of such massive , off - centre cool gas clumps can be used to diagnose the dynamical state of a cluster , especially when violent merger signatures ( e.g. prominent shocks and cold fronts ) are absent .",
