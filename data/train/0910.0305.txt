    "the following question was formulated in @xcite for an arbitrary finitely presented group @xmath2 : _ does there exist a compact @xmath0-polyhedron @xmath3 with @xmath4 whose universal cover @xmath5 is proper homotopy equivalent to a @xmath1-manifold ? _",
    "if so , the group @xmath2 is said to be _",
    "properly @xmath1-realizable_. recall that two spaces are said to be proper homotopy equivalent if they are homotopy equivalent and all homotopies involved are proper maps , i.e. , they have the property that the inverse image of every compact subset is compact .",
    "it is a fact that one can get the above universal cover @xmath5 of @xmath3 proper homotopy equivalent to a @xmath6-manifold , as one can take @xmath3 to be the cayley complex associated to a ( finite ) group presentation of @xmath2 , which can easily be embeded in @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , it is known that the proper homotopy type of any locally finite @xmath0-dimensional @xmath8-complex can be represented by a subpolyhedron in @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the question whether or not one can do better than this , i.e. , whether or not a given finitely presented group @xmath2 is properly @xmath1-realizable , is of interest as it has implications in the theory of cohomology of groups : if @xmath2 is properly @xmath1-realizable then for some ( equivalently any ) compact @xmath0-polyhedron @xmath3 with @xmath9 the group @xmath10 is free abelian ( by manifold duality arguments ) , and hence so is @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is a long standing conjecture ( attributed to hopf ) that @xmath11 is free abelian for every finitely presented group @xmath2 .",
    "observe that there are examples of locally compact , simply connected @xmath0-polyhedra @xmath12 for which @xmath13 is not free abelian , but they are known not to be covering spaces of compact polyhedra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several results in the literature regarding properly @xmath1-realizable groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an example of a non-@xmath1-manifold group which has this property is already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have recently found that there are groups which are @xmath14-ended and semistable at infinity but not properly @xmath1-realizable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of the present paper is :    every finitely generated one - relator group @xmath2 with finitely many ends is properly @xmath1-realizable .",
    "recall that , given a compact @xmath0-polyhedron @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 as its universal cover , the number of ends of @xmath2 equals the number of ends of @xmath5 which in turn equals @xmath15 or @xmath16 ( see @xcite ) .    given a one - relator group @xmath2 and a presentation @xmath17 of @xmath2 with a single defining relation , it is shown in proposition [ prop ] below that we can alter ( within its proper homotopy type ) the universal cover @xmath18 of the standard @xmath0-complex @xmath19 associated to this presentation so as to get a new @xmath0-complex @xmath20 together with a filtration @xmath21 of compact simply connected subcomplexes such that ( for any given base ray in @xmath20 ) the tower of groups , @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 is a telescopic tower , i.e. , it is a tower of finitely generated free groups of increasing bases where the bonding maps are projections ( see @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 ( and hence the fundamental pro - group of @xmath2 ) is also of that type , up to pro - isomorphism . in the @xmath14-ended case",

    "note that we are already done in the @xmath26-ended or @xmath0-ended case as the @xmath26-ended case corresponds to finite cyclic groups , and in the @xmath0-ended case we only have to deal with the group @xmath27 of integers , which is the only one - relator group having @xmath27 as a subgroup of finite index .",

    "observe that the proof of theorem 1.1 given above shows that the group @xmath2 is semistable at infinity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . see @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath17 is any finite group presentation of @xmath2 with a single defining relation and @xmath19 is the standard @xmath0-complex ( with a single vertex and a single @xmath0-cell ) associated to this presentation , then theorem 1.1 together with ( @xcite , prop .",
    "1.3 ) yields that the universal cover of @xmath29 is proper homotopy equivalent to a @xmath1-manifold .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that we may disregard the @xmath0-sphere , having the universal cover of @xmath19 proper homotopy equivalent to a @xmath1-manifold itself .",
    "every torsion - free finitely generated one - relator group @xmath2 is properly @xmath1-realizable .",
    "observe that , in general , if a group has infinitely many ends then stallings theorem tells us that it splits as an amalgamated free product or an hnn - extension over a finite group ( see @xcite ) , and dunwoody s accessibility result @xcite shows that the process of further factorization of the group in this way must terminate after a finite number of steps , and each of the factors can have at most one end . in the torsion - free case ,",
    "the above translates into a decomposition of @xmath2 into a free product of a free group with a one - relator group , the latter having at most one end .",
    "the conclusion now follows from theorem 1.1 and the fact that free groups are properly @xmath1-realizable , and free products of properly @xmath1-realizable groups are again properly @xmath1-realizable ( see ( @xcite , thm .",
    "1.4 ) ) .    on the other hand , a conjecture of the following type was stated in @xcite : _ if a torsion - free one relator group decomposes as a certain amalgamated free product @xmath30 over a free group @xmath31 , then each of the factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be either a free group or a one - relator group_. in fact , it was proved in @xcite that this is so from the homology viewpoint .",
    "we hereby pose the following conjecture :    if a one - relator group with torsion decomposes as an amalgamated free product @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "an hnn - extension @xmath34 ) over a finite group @xmath31 ( which is necessarily cyclic , see @xcite ) , then each of the factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "the base group @xmath32 ) must be either a one - relator group or a free product of one - relator groups ( with torsion ) .",
    "observe that if this conjecture is true then , using the results of stallings and dunwoody ( as in corollary 1.2 ) , the problem of showing that all finitely generated one - relator groups are properly @xmath1-realizable can be reduced to the @xmath14-ended case , by ( @xcite , thm .",

    "thus , we conjecture the following :    the  finitely many ended \" hypothesis in theorem 1.1 can be omitted .",
