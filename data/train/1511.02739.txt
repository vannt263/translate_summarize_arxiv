    "many prodigious phenomena in atomic and molecular physics are the consequences of quantum coherence and interference @xcite .",
    "a pronounced coherence phenomenon , called _ vacuum - induced coherence _ ( vic ) , arises due to the quantum interference between the spontaneous emission pathways from the excited doublet to a common ground state @xcite .",
    "the coupling between decay pathways via the same continuum of vacuum states of electromagnetic fields create these interfering channels . recently ,",
    "numerous theoretical studies have reported fascinating applications of such quantum interference @xcite .",
    "more than two decades ago , it was shown that vic can lead to the cancellation of spontaneous emission from the two nondegenerate upper levels of a three level system @xcite .",
    "quantum interference effects on the spectrum of emission from two upper levels driven by a coherent field was studied by zhu @xcite . in a model study ,",
    "the elimination of spectral line in the spontaneous emission spectrum was demonstrated by zhu and scully @xcite . in an analogous problem ,",
    "the suppression of autoionization in a three - level system with two degenerate upper levels was shown by harris @xcite . in all such theoretical studies on quantum interference , the common underlying basis is the interaction of discrete levels with a continuum of states .",
    "one of the stringent requirement for the vic to occur is the _ nonorthogonality _ of the dipole matrix elements of the two transitions from degenerate or quasi - degenerate excited states @xcite to the common ground state .",
    "it is very difficult , if not impossible , to fulfill this condition in atomic systems .",
    "however , it is shown in @xcite that this condition can be bypassed by placing the atom in _",
    "anisotropic vacuum_. the simulation of quantum interference in atomic systems without near - degenerate levels has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "moreover , possible realizations of vic have been proposed in ions @xcite , semiconductor quantum - well @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and in mssbauer nuclei @xcite . despite these attempts ,",
    "a clear manifestation of vic in atomic systems still remains elusive .",
    "on the other hand , the situation is entirely different in cold molecules which appear to be quite promising systems for exploration of vic .",
    "in fact , the vic can appear naturally in molecular systems @xcite , as it is possible to identify non - orthogonal dipole transitions in molecules unlike in atoms .",
    "such non - orthogonal transitions in a diatomic molecule arises due to the coupling of the rotation of molecular axis with molecular electronic angular momentum .",
    "it is possible to find diatomic molecules having suitable v - type three level structures , with both upper levels being either degenerate or non - degenerate for exploring vic .",
    "consider a molecule initially prepared in a particular vibrational level @xmath0 and rotational level @xmath1 in spin - singlet ( @xmath2 ) electronic ground state .",
    "let this initial state be represented by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the molecular electronic orbital angular momentum and its projection onto the the internuclear axis which is molecule - fixed @xmath6-axis .",
    "let us consider laser transitions from this state to two excited molecular states @xmath7 and @xmath8 which have the same rotational and the same molecular electronic states . @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the vibrational quantum numbers of the two excited states .",
    "now , in the first approximation , when higher order spin - orbit , spin - rotation and orbit - rotation interactions are neglected , one of the good molecular quantum numbers in hund s case ( a ) and ( b ) is @xmath11 .",
    "now , if we choose @xmath12 , that is , both the excited levels belonging to @xmath13 states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 should be necessarily different and so the two excited states are non - degenerate .",
    "on the other hand , if we select @xmath14 or equivalently , @xmath15 , that is both the excited levels being in the @xmath16 states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 may or may not be equal . if it is chosen that @xmath17 , then the two states with @xmath18 are degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy will be lifted by @xmath19-doubling effect @xcite . in this particular case , @xmath19-doubling will occur due to orbit - rotation coupling . in both",
    "the non - degenerate ( @xmath20 ) and the degenerate ( @xmath17 ) cases , the molecular transition dipole moments are parallel .",
    "the non - degenerate case with @xmath12 and @xmath20 satisfy exactly the same condition as considered by imamoglu @xcite in a model three - level atomic system for realization of vic effects about twenty six years ago . probably , it is difficult to find such an atomic system having two upper levels with same electronic angular momentum states .",
    "but , molecular systems , particularly the emerging area of cold molecules presents a promising perspective for realization of vic and related effects . in the particular scheme of molecular transitions we consider here , the two transitions occur between the same rotational and electronic levels",
    ". therefore , the electronic part of the dipole moment matrix elements will be the same , as the two dipole moments are parallel . in the non - degenerate case , these matrix elements differ only slightly by the franck - condon ( fc ) overlap integrals for the two vibrational states which may be taken as the two nearby even or odd vibrational levels with large vibrational quantum numbers so that the energy spacing between them is small .",
    "usually , population oscillation in the excited vibrational states is understood as an effect of vic and thus is used to detect vic in experiments . as the population in the excited state occurs due to _ absorption _ of the probe field",
    ", it is the _ imaginary part _ of the susceptibility of the medium , that plays the most important role in such detection . in this work",
    ", we present a different strategy - we show how the _ dispersion _ of the probe field ( or equivalently , the _ real part _ of the susceptibility ) can be manipulated to obtain a measurable signature of vic . precisely speaking",
    ", we explore a way to probe vic in molecules by observing its influence on magneto - optical rotation ( mor ) .",
    "mor refers to the rotation of the plane of polarization of light , while propagating through the medium in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "it occurs essentially due to birefringence or dichroism induced in the medium by the applied magnetic field .",
    "the angle of mor of a linearly polarized weak field propagating through a medium with negligible absorption is given by @xmath21 where , @xmath22 represent the susceptibilities of the medium corresponding to right ( + ) and left ( - ) circular polarization of the probe field , respectively , @xmath23 is the propagation constant of the weak field and @xmath4 is the length of the medium .",
    "mor angle can be enhanced by creating large anisotropy in the medium using a high magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement can also be accomplished by a coherent control field @xcite . a nice review on mor and its applications",
    "can be found in @xcite .    here",
    "we show that in the presence of vic , the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light propagating through a medium of cold molecules can be significantly large at resonance .",
    "further , the angle of rotation as large as @xmath24 can be achieved by employing a control field and a magnetic field .",
    "for this purpose a medium of cold molecules @xcite is useful , as it is possible to suppress thermal fluctuations so that low lying rotational states can be accessed for the existence of vic .",
    "the large mor angle so obtained can be employed as a tool for the sensitive detection of very weak magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a small change in magnetic field can lead to large change in the mor angle , and thereby to large measurement sensitivity @xcite .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] implies that polarization rotation of the field at the output increases with increase in the difference in the refractive indices ( circular birefringence ) of the circular components of the probe field .",
    "this control can be made by the presence of the control field and the existence of vic into the system .",

    "it is easy to fulfill this condition by choosing spin - singlet @xmath95 transitions , since the lifting of @xmath19-degeneracy due to the orbit - rotation coupling would be very small @xcite . in non - degenerate case @xmath96 , in order to have small spacing between the two excited states , the vibrational levels should be highly excited and lie close to dissociation threshold",
    ". such states will be stable only at a very low temperature .",
    "now , accessing such excited states by optical dipole transitions from a deeply - bound vibrational level in the singlet ground - state molecular potential will be difficult due to extremely poor franck - condon factor .",
    "however , with recent advances in the production of feshbach molecules @xcite and the cold molecules in the triplet ground - state potentials @xcite , excited vibrational levels with appropriate spacing as required for vic seem to be accessible by transitions from a molecular state in the triplet ground - state potential .",
    "for example , rbk @xcite and cs@xmath97 @xcite in the triplet ground - state in the ultracold temperature regime have been produced .",

    "< , < \" , ]     the above study suggests that the mor angle can be enhanced at resonance without any ellipticity at the output . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show how the mor angle and circular dichroism vary with probe field detuning @xmath119 , when the angle between the two dipole moments change between zero and @xmath120 .",
    "it is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) that in presence of vic ( @xmath121 ) , the mor angle can be large at resonance , while in absence of vic ( @xmath62 ) , this angle becomes much smaller at resonance [ fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) ] .",
    "it is to be noted that the mor angle becomes large also for @xmath62 , but at detuned frequencies [ fig . [ fig8](b ) ] .",
    "however , here , we focus on resonance , as the circular dichroism vanishes at resonance , thereby causing the polarization to remain linear at the output ( note that for large detuning the mor angle is accompanied by large cicrcular dichroism , see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , which results in the ellipticity of the output polarization ) .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to explore the behavior of mor at resonance , for which the parallel dipole moments give rise to large @xmath122 in contrast to orthogonal case .",
    "we thus conclude that the enhancement in the angle of rotation of polarization at the output can be appraised as an effect of vic and therefore can be chosen as a signature of vic in the molecular systems .",
    "the preceding analysis delineates that the large mor angle is a consequence of the cooperation of vic and the control field . such a large mor angle due to",
    "the presence of vic provides an extra knob to measure the weak magnetic field .",
    "usually , a small magnetic field produces very small anisotropy in the system and hence a very small mor angle which is difficult to detect .",
    "but , here we obtain mor angle as large as ( @xmath123 ) even with small magnetic field .",
    "thus , by measuring mor angle we can estimate the feeble magnetic field .",
    "for example , at resonance for a magnetic field as low as @xmath124 , a mor angle as large as @xmath125 can be achieved for @xmath121 and @xmath126 , whereas in the absence of vic , this angle becomes much smaller @xmath127 .",
    "further , the sensitivity of the detectable magnetic field is limited by particulars of experiment , for instance , by shot noise @xcite and ac - stark shifts @xcite .",
    "however , the limitation due to ac - stark shift can be compensated by adjusting the detuning between the hyperfine components of the upper level in such a way that the light shifts cancel @xcite .",
    "based on the shot noise limit , the sensitivity ( @xmath128 ) of the magnetic field along the direction of propagation is given by @xcite @xmath129 where , @xmath130 number photons detected and @xmath131 is the slope of polarization rotation with the longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "here , the sensitivity of the proposed magnetometer using the parameters of @xcite turns out be of the order of 10@xmath132 g/@xmath133 @xcite , where @xmath134 is the numeric value of @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the magnetometer based on vic can measure a very feeble magnetic field with very high sensitivity which is comparable to that reported in @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) and spin exchange relaxation - free ( serf ) magnetometers have sensitivities of the order of 10@xmath136 t/@xmath133 and 10@xmath137 t/@xmath133 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the relaxation processes can be controlled in the proposed magnetometer , its sensitivity may be made comparable to these magnetometers .",
    "in conclusions , we have shown how vic can lead to the enhancement of mor angle in a molecular system .",
    "we have illustrated that the coupling between the degenerate excited states resulting from the interference between decay pathways can produce large value of mor angle without ellipticity at the output .",
    "this provides a signature of vic .",
    "we have analyzed how the combined effects of control and magnetic field in the presence of vic can produce substantial mor angle .",
    "we have identified a parameter regime of these fields where resonant enhancement of birefringence and therefore of mor angle is possible .",
    "further , we have discussed how such a large mor angle can act as the probe of weak magnetic field with large measurement sensitivity .",
    "mor can happen without vic , but vic leads to the enhancement .",
    "so , experimentally , a proof of vic can be established by showing this enhancement . to achieve this , one has to compare the results with and without vic . to do an experiment without vic",
    "is simple- just to choose two degenerate or nearly degenerate excited states with no restriction on the orthogonality of two transitions . to select two non - orthogonal transitions",
    "is the key to realize the vic effects .",
    "cold molecular systems will provide a useful platform in this regard .",
    "the current experimental efforts in producing cold molecules by photo @xcite - or magneto - association @xcite has mainly focused on the preparation of deeply bound molecules in absolute ro - vibrational singlet ground - state potential . since",
    "such molecules are formed from ultracold atoms , they are by default translationally and rotationally cold . therefore ,",
    "such cold molecules offer experimental advantage in selecting the desired rotational and vibrational levels for realizing the discussed effects .",
    "particularly , in the near - degenerate @xmath19-doubling case , deeply bound ground - state molecules in singlet state will be useful for inducing @xmath138 transitions .",
    "moreover , in recent times , many groups have demonstrated direct laser cooling of molecules in singlet ground - state potential @xcite",
    ".    in non - degenerate case , loosely bound ro - vibrational states in shallower ground - state triplet potential will be more useful , since one can then access the required upper levels from such ro - vibrational levels .",
    "typically , the linewidth of molecular excited levels is of the order of 10 mhz .",
    "therefore , one has to look for two excited vibrational levels having the same electronic angular momenta with vibrational spacing being less than or equal to the linewidth . with the rapid progress in the production of cold molecules in recent times @xcite , the prospect for realization of vic - assisted mor in near future seems to be quite promising .",
    "an alternative approach to probe vic using the mor effect is to use two orthogonal photoassociative transitions from the collisional continuum of two ultracold atoms in the electronic ground state molecular potential .",
