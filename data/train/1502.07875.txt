    "the statistics of elementary particles is a key underlying ingredient of quantum field theory which has been most successful in explaining three , _ viz .",
    "_ electromagnetic , weak and strong nuclear forces , of the four fundamental forces in nature . on the other hand ,",
    "the explicit role of quantum statistics in physical phenomena such as bose condensation @xcite is also being increasingly displayed in recent years .",
    "practical applications of such statistics is potentially wide , ranging from optical lattices @xcite to quantum information @xcite . in most practical manifestations of the role of bose statistics , a crucial role",
    "is played by the measurement of the time of flight distribution @xcite .",
    "for example , the coherence properties of a condensate of ultracold atoms is imprinted on the time of flight distribution when the trapping potential is released and the particles undergo free fall .",
    "thus , the effect of gravity on the motion of quantum particles seems to play an important role in the inference of attributes related to the statistics obeyed by them .    the motion of freely falling particles is traditionally taken to conform to the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) of gravitation which states that all sufficiently small objects fall with the same acceleration independent of their mass and constituent in a uniform gravitational field .",
    "wep is regarded to be a fundamentally classical and local principle .",
    "study of the equivalence principle in quantum mechanics has evoked enough interest .",
    "a statement of the principle in quantum mechanics is as follows : `` the results of experiments in an external potential comprising just a sufficiently weak , homogeneous gravitational field , as determined by the wavefunction , are independent of the mass of the system '' @xcite .",
    "this assertion is also called the weak equivalence principle of quantum mechanics ( weq ) .",
    "different approaches have been used to study the possibility of violation of weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics , starting from the prediction of mass - dependence of the radii , frequencies and binding energy of a particle in an external gravitational field @xcite .",
    "experimental probes into possibility of violation of the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics have been attempted using interference phenomenon associated with the gravitational potential in neutron and atomic interferometry experiments @xcite . however , the phase shifts observed in such experiments @xcite may be expressed in terms of directly observable quantities which turn out to be independent of mass @xcite , thus ruling out the violation in this context .",
    "moreover , atomic interferometry experiments @xcite need to be performed with different atomic species in order for a rigorous experimental test of the weak equivalence principle at the quantum level .",
    "a gedanken experiment studying the free fall of quantum test particles in a uniform gravitational field predicts mass - dependence of the time of flight distribution @xcite .",
    "another approach using a model quantum clock predicts violation of weq in the vicinity of the turning point of classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "an explicit mass dependence of the position probabilities has been shown for quantum particles projected upwards against gravity around both the classical turning point and the point of initial projection using gaussian @xcite and non - gaussian @xcite wavepackets . moreover ,",
    "explicit mass dependence of the mean arrival time at an arbitrary detector location has also been predicted for a gaussian @xcite wave - packet under free fall .",
    "such mass - dependence may be enhanced using suitably chosen non - gaussian wavepackets @xcite .",
    "thus , both the position probabilities and the mean arrival time show the violation of weq for quantum particles described by gaussian and non - gaussian wavepackets . it has been discussed",
    "violation of weq arises as a consequence of the spread of wave packets , the magnitude of which itself depends on the mass .",
    "an illustration of this effect has been presented based on bohmian trajectories @xcite .",
    "the above studies have established the violation of weq in single particle quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the effect of quantum statistics on the violation of weq has remained uninvestigated till date .",
    "as pointed out earlier , several important phenomena based on quantum statistics is experimentally revealed through the measurement of time of flight of quantum particles in free fall .",
    "consideration of quantum mechanical effects on such time of flight distributions beyond the standard semi - classical analysis could reveal interesting observational effects , as has been debated earlier in the literature @xcite . in the present work we are interested to examine the effect of quantum statistics on the weq . with the above motivation in this paper we study the effect of statistics on the arrival time distribution of a system of freely falling wavepackets consisting of two identical particles .",
    "our analysis is based on the probability current approach for computing the mean arrival time distribution of wavepackets @xcite . before embarking on the study of weq",
    ", we will first consider the free evolution of a system of two identical particles to investigate if there is any effect of bose - einstein ( be ) or fermi - dirac ( fd ) statistics on the arrival time distributions .",
    "quantum statistics is fundamentally related to the spin of the quantum particles .",
    "it has been shown earlier that inclusion of spin enables a unique determination of the relativistic probability current @xcite leading to an explicit spin - dependent effect at the non - relativistic level for freely evolving fermions @xcite as well as bosons @xcite . here",
    "we present a calculation of the effect of such explicit spin - dependence on the violation of weq for a system of two identical particles in free fall .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section we present the framework for studying the arrival time distribution for a system of two particles using the probability current approach .",
    "we show that symmetrization or anti - symmetrization of the wavefunction leads to differences from the case of maxwell - boltzmann statistics when there is overlap of the wavepackets . in section iii the effect of",
    "be and fd statistics on freely propagating wavepackets is studied . in section",
    "iv we address the main motivation of the paper by studying the violation of weq separately using two different schemes , _ viz _ , ( a ) effect of statistics on the arrival time distribution , and ( b ) effect of explicit spin - dependence on the arrival time distribution of freely falling wavepackets .",
    "section v contains a summary of the main results along with certain concluding remarks .",
    "consider a two - body system composed of two non - interacting identical particles in an external field .",
    "identical particles are classically distinguishable and obey maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics , while they are indistinguishable in quantum mechanics and obey different statistics . for fermi - dirac",
    "( bose - einstein ) statistics the total wavefunction must be antisymmetrized ( symmetrized ) under the exchange of particles in the system .",
    "since particles do not interact , solutions of the schrdinger equation are constructed from two single - particle wavefunctions @xmath0 and @xmath1 as follows @xcite : @xmath2~,\\label{eq : two - body psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where upper ( lower ) sign stands for be ( fd ) statistics and the normalization constants are given by @xmath3^{-1/2 } $ ] .",
    "two - body wavefunctions ( [ eq : two - body psi ] ) are solutions of the two - body schrdinger equation @xmath4 where the hamiltonian is clearly symmetric under the exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "the single - particle continuity equation may be derived @xcite in the following way .",
    "the partial derivative of @xmath12 with respect to the time is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho1 ] ) by performing integration by parts and using the fact that the wavefunction vanishes at infinity , to obtain @xmath13 now , using the normalization condition for the single - particle wavefunctions , one obtains the continuity equation @xcite @xmath14 for the one - body probability density @xmath12 ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) , with the one - body probability current density given by @xmath15 for distinguishable particles obeying classical mb statistics , each particle has its corresponding continuity equation , @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 so , for a two - particle system , the mb probability density and probability current density are given by @xmath19 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rho1 ] ) and ( [ eq : prob_qm_twobody ] ) , one sees that as long as the single - particle wavefunctions have negligible overlap , i.e. , @xmath20 , there is no need for symmetrization . as a result",
    ", one can ignore indistinguishability of particles and thus use mb statistics for which motions of particles are independent .",
    "hence , in the latter case a similar analysis to the one - body systems discussed earlier @xcite may be employed .",
    "in this section we study the effect of symmetrization and asymmetrization of a two - body freely propagating wavefunction on the arrival time distribution computed through the probability current approach .",
    "the initial one - particle wavefunctions are taken to be gaussian packets given by eq.([eq : initial_1p_gauss_packet ] ) .",

    "as the separation grows , the quantum and classical results approach : @xmath32 the position expectation value with respect to @xmath12 reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the classical path of the center of the wavepacket @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "one sees that the expectation value of the center of mass operator is just the position expectation value with respect to @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath36    we calculate the arrival time distribution at the detector location @xmath37 by substituting eq.([eq : gauss_packet0 ] ) in the expression for the probability current given by eq.([eq : prob_qm_twobody ] ) , and then substituting the obtained expression in eq.([eq : arrival distribution ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters used for our numerical computations are given by : @xmath38 m , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 kg , and @xmath43 ms .",
    "in figure [ fig : ardis_separation_freeevolve ] the arrival time distribution has been plotted for different values of initial separation of the wavepackets .",
    "it is observed that the inclusion of particle statistics through symmetrization and antisymmetrization of a two - body wavefunction has a perceptible impact on the arrival time distribution .",
    "such an effect of particle statistics on arrival times of freely propagating particles has been studied earlier by using the concept of the crossing state and the second quantization formalism @xcite . in the present work",
    "we further compute the effect of initial separation of the overlapping wavepackets , as is displayed in the figure [ fig : ardis_separation_freeevolve ] .",
    "we fix the center of @xmath1 and change the center of @xmath0 from one plot to the other . using eq .",

    "( [ eq : mean arrival ] ) , for the parameters of fig .",

    "now , in order to show the explicit mass dependence of arrival time for particles in free fall we plot the mean arrival time versus mass in the figure [ fig : freefall_tau_mass ] . here again , the mean arrival time is computed at the detector location @xmath37 using eq.([eq : arrival distribution ] ) and eq.([eq : mean arrival ] ) after substituting the expression for the time - evolved wavefunction eq.([eq : gauss_packet ] ) in the expression for the probability current given by eq.([eq : prob_qm_twobody ] ) .",

    "however , here ( figure [ fig : freefall_meanmass ] ) again we find that the mass dependence of the mean arrival time vanishes for large mass , signifying emergence of weq in the classical limit .",
    "in this work we have investigated the effect of particle statistics on the arrival time distribution of gaussian wave packets .",
    "we have employed the probability current approach @xcite for computing the arrival time distribution for a system of two particles .",
    "the probability current approach provides an unambiguous definition @xcite of the arrival time of quantum particles , and also leads to a proper classical limit @xcite of quantum dynamics .",
    "the single - particle arrival time distributions using the probability current approach have been studied earlier in the literature for the cases of free evolution , leading to the interesting effect of the spin - dependence @xcite of arrival time .",
    "it was also observed earlier that the mean arrival time for particles freely falling under gravity acquires mass - dependence , thus signifying violation of the weak equivalence principle of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "such violation stems essentially from the spread of propagating wavepackets that is mass - dependent .    in the present analysis",
    "we have shown for the first time that symmetrization or asymmetrization of a two body wavefunction leads to modification of the arrival time distribution even for freely propagating wavepackets . the impact of particle statistics on the arrival time distribution is observed for initially overlapping gaussian wavepackets .",
    "for the case of particles falling freely under gravity , the mean arrival time acquires mass dependence signifying violation of weq .",
    "the magnitude of violation is seen to be different for mb , be and fd statistics as a consequence of the difference in the mass dependence of the mean arrival time for the case of different statistics .",
    "we have also compared such a violation under the influence of particle statistics with the violation of weq obtained through the explicit introduction of particle spin in the probability current .",
    "the modification of the mean arrival time in the former approach is shown to be larger than in the latter for the case of gaussian wavepackets considered here . however , in both the approaches , weq emerges smoothly in the limit of large mass .",
    "it may be noted that each of the three statistics gives a different mean arrival time in the large mass limit .",
    "such difference stems essentially from the difference in the position expectation value and the spread of the wave packets for the respective statistics , and may be viewed as a remnant effect of particle statistics in the classical limit .",
    "we conclude by observing that the effect of particle statistics in different quantum phenomena is regarded to be of much importance motivating newer tests beyond traditional arenas @xcite .",
    "our approach of studying the influence of particle statistics on the arrival time distribution provides an independent manifestation of the fundamental quantum property of indistinguishability .",
    "moreover , the analysis of transit and flight times @xcite is a key ingredient in experiments involving bose condensates which form a major avenue of revealing the effect of quantum statistics .",
    "the results reported in the present paper using symmetric gaussian wavepackets furnish an example of the effect of particle statistics on the arrival time distribution .",
    "though the magnitude of the difference in observable quantities resulting from different statistics , as computed in the present work may not be high enough for direct experimental detection , they provide an _ in principle _ signature of differential violation of weq for different statistics .",
    "more elaborate calculations are needed using different sets of parameters , and various forms of wavepackets such as asymmetric @xcite or non - gaussian @xcite ones in order to raise the possibility of observational verification of such effects .",
