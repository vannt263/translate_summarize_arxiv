    "among the fundamental problems in the theory of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) are to clarify ( i ) how the interaction between particles changes the properties of the condensate and one - particle excitations from those of ideal gases,@xcite and ( ii ) how the macroscopic coherence indispensable for superfluidity emerges .",
    "this paper makes a contribution to these issues by constructing a variational wave function for the ground state with a new ingredient , i.e. , the @xmath0-body processes where a collision of two non - condensed particles throws one of them into the condensate and vice versa .",
    "these are dynamical processes beyond the scope of the mean - field treatment that have not been considered non - perturbatively .",
    "this wave function is given as a _ superposition in terms of the number of condensed particles _ within the fixed - number formalism , instead of the total number of particles in a subsystem as discussed by anderson,@xcite where depleted particles serve as the particle reservoir for the condensate exchanging particles dynamically .",
    "thus , the superposition , which is indispensable for bringing macroscopic coherence to the condensate,@xcite emerges naturally due to the interaction and is also maintained dynamically .",
    "the @xmath0-body processes are also shown to transform the free - particle spectrum of non - condensed particles in ideal gases into that of a bubbling mode with an intrinsic decay rate , as expected naturally in the presence of the dynamical exchange of particles between the non - condensate reservoir and condensate .        in 1959 ,",
    "girardeau and arnowitt@xcite constructed a variational wave function for the ground state of homogeneous weakly interacting bosons so that it is the vacuum of bogoliubov s quasiparticle operators.@xcite they used it to evaluate the ground - state energy incorporating two - body interactions of non - condensed particles , i.e. , process ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in addition to processes ( a ) and ( b ) of the bogoliubov theory.@xcite however , this apparent improvement brought about an unphysical energy gap in the one - particle excitation spectrum,@xcite unlike the bogoliubov spectrum with a gapless linear dispersion and an infinite lifetime in the long - wavelength limit,@xcite which is in contradiction to the hugenholtz - pines theorem@xcite or goldstone s theorem i.@xcite this fact suggests that something crucial may be missing from the girardeau - arnowitt wave function , which still remains unidentified explicitly .",
    "the key observation here is that process ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which involves a smaller number of non - condensed particles than ( d ) , makes no contribution to the energy in the girardeau - arnowitt theory.@xcite hence , improving the variational state so as to make process ( c ) active is expected to lower the energy further and approximate the true ground state more closely .",
    "such a state will be constructed below .",
    "it is also interesting to see how process ( c ) affects properties of one - particle excitations .",
    "we investigate this using the moment method developed previously.@xcite widely accepted results on the excitations may be summarized as follows : ( i ) a finite repulsive interaction between particles turns the free one - particle spectrum @xmath1 of ideal gases into the bogoliubov spectrum @xmath2 with a lifetime @xmath3 that tends to infinity as the wavenumber @xmath4 approaches @xmath5;@xcite ( ii ) the bogoliubov mode is also identical to the density - fluctuation mode ( phonons ) in the two - particle channel;@xcite ( iii ) the bogoliubov mode is the nambu - goldstone mode of broken @xmath6 symmetry.@xcite on the other hand , an alternative picture has been presented recently based on a self - consistent perturbation expansion satisfying goldstone s theorem i and conservation laws simultaneously:@xcite ( i@xmath7 ) the excitation in the one - particle channel is a bubbling mode with a finite lifetime @xmath8 even for @xmath9;@xcite ( ii@xmath7 ) excitations in the one- and two - particle channels are different from each other;@xcite ( iii@xmath7 ) the distinct modes in the two channels correspond to two different proofs of goldstone s theorem,@xcite the contents of which are not equivalent and should be distinguished as i and ii .",
    "indeed , it has been shown@xcite that the first proof using the invariance of the effective action under a linear transformation@xcite is relevant to the poles of the one - particle green s function in the context of bec , whereas the second ( and more familiar ) one based on the vacuum expectation of the commutator of the current and field is concerned with the poles of the two - particle green s function .    here",

    "[ fig1 ] naturally produces the dynamical exchange of particles between the non - condensate reservoir and condensate , thereby giving rise to an intrinsic decay rate for non - condensed particles even for @xmath9 .",

    "<S> we construct a variational wave function for the ground state of weakly interacting bosons that gives a lower energy than the mean - field girardeau - arnowitt ( or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is brought about by incorporating the dynamical @xmath0-body processes where one of two colliding non - condensed particles drops into the condensate and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the processes are also shown to transform the one - particle excitation spectrum into a bubbling mode with a finite lifetime even in the long - wavelength limit . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath0-body processes , which give rise to dynamical exchange of particles between the non - condensate reservoir and condensate absent in ideal gases , are identified as a key mechanism for realizing and sustaining macroscopic coherence in bose - einstein condensates . </S>"
