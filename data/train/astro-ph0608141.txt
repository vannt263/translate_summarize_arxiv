    "these results are based on integrations of the orbital evolution of dust particles developed by ipatov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ipatov & mather ( 2006a - b ) ( all our recent papers can be found at astro - ph and at http://www.astro.umd.edu/$\\sim$ipatov ) . in sections 3 and 4 , based on the results of our runs ,",
    "we consider our model calculations of the radial velocity profile of the scattered mg  i line .",
    "we compare plots of centroid velocities and line widths of the mg  i line versus solar elongation with wham observations obtained by reynolds et al .",
    "studies of typical eccentricities and inclinations of zodiacal dust particles that fit the wham observations are presented in section 5 . in previous papers ,",
    "observations have been compared with analytical models , but this is the first comparison with numerical integrations of the particles .",
    "our studies of the mg  i line shifts use the results of following the orbital evolution of about 15,000 asteroidal , cometary , and trans - neptunian dust particles under the gravitational influence of planets ( excluding pluto for asteroidal and cometary particles ) , the poynting - robertson drag , radiation pressure , and solar wind drag .",
    "results of some of these integrations were presented by ipatov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ipatov & mather ( 2006a - b ) . as in liou et al .",

    "the @xmath1 values 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 , and 0.4 correspond to particle diameters @xmath9 of about 120 , 47 , 9.4 , 4.7 , and 1 microns , respectively . for water ice",
    ", @xmath9 is greater by a factor of 2.5 than that for silicate particles .",
    "the orbital evolution of dust particles was studied for a wider range of masses ( including particles up to several milimeters ) of asteroidal and cometary particles than in the papers by other authors ( e.g. , dermott et al .",

    "smaller particles have a larger surface per unit of mass of particles .",
    "it has been proposed ( grn et al . 1985 ) that the main contribution to the zodiacal light is from particles that range from 20 to 200 @xmath7 m in diameter ( for silicate particles , this range corresponds to @xmath1 about 0.002 - 0.02 ) . according to grn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the lorentz force is comparable to solar gravitational interaction for particles of @xmath9@xmath100.1 @xmath7 m at 1 au and of @xmath9@xmath101 @xmath7 m at 50 au .",
    "interstellar particles dominate among such small particles , and are not believed to be significant contributers to the zodiacal light .",
    "we considered mainly larger interplanetary particles , so we did not include the lorentz force in our runs .",
    "migration of dust particles was integrated using the bulirsh - stoer method ( bulsto ) with the relative error per integration step less than @xmath11 .",
    "the swift integration package by levison & duncan ( 1994 ) was modified to include the additional forces of radiation pressure , poynting - robertson drag , and solar wind drag .",

    "orbital elements were stored with a step of @xmath14 of 20 yr for asteroidal and cometary particles and 100 yr for trans - neptunian particles during all considered time intervals .",
    "the stored orbital elements of all particles during their dynamical lifetimes were then used in our studies of the velocities of particles presented in the next section .",
    "the planets were assumed to be material points .",
    "however , using orbital elements obtained with a step @xmath14 , ipatov and mather ( 2006a ) calculated the mean probability of a collision of a particle with the planet during the particle lifetime .",
    "the total probability of collisions of all particles with planets in one run is small .",
    "therefore , in most runs the results obtained will be exactly the same whether or not we consider collisions of particles with planets during integration .",
    "even if there were a particle that actually collides with a planet , the sum of dynamical lifetimes of all particles and the distribution of particles over their orbital elements during their dynamical lifetimes will be practically the same as in the model for which planets are considered as material points .",
    "destruction of particles due to their collisions with other particles is also not considered in the present paper .",
    "the destruction affects mainly lifetimes of particles and their size distributions at different distances from the sun , but not the distribution of the particles orbital elements during their migration in the zodiacal cloud . in future models , which will consider the size distributions of particles , we plan to take into account the destruction of particles .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of asteroidal particles used in our models were the same as those of the first @xmath12 numbered main - belt asteroids ( jdt 2452500.5 ) , i.e. , dust particles are assumed to leave the asteroids with zero relative velocity .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of the trans - neptunian particles were the same as those of the first trans - neptunian objects ( jdt 2452600.5 ) .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of cometary particles were the same as those of comet 2p / encke ( @xmath15@xmath162.2 au , @xmath17@xmath160.85 , @xmath18@xmath1612@xmath19 ) , or comet 10p / tempel 2 ( @xmath15@xmath163.1 au , @xmath17@xmath160.526 , @xmath18@xmath1612@xmath19 ) , or comet 39p / oterma ( @xmath15@xmath167.25 au , @xmath17@xmath160.246 , @xmath18@xmath162@xmath19 ) , or long - period comets ( @xmath17=0.995 , @xmath20=@xmath15@xmath21(1-@xmath17)=0.9 au or @xmath20=0.1 au , @xmath18 varied from 0 to 180@xmath19 in each run , particles started at perihelion ; these runs are denoted as ` lp ' runs ) .",
    "we considered encke particles starting near perihelion ( runs denoted as 2p ) , near aphelion ( runs denoted as ` 2p 0.5 t ' ) , and when the comet had orbited for @xmath22 after perihelion passage , where @xmath23 is the period of the comet ( runs denoted as ` 2p 0.25 t ' ) . note that semimajor axes and eccentricities of dust particles differed from those of parent bodies , but inclinations were the same .    for cometary particles ,",
    "the initial value of time @xmath24 when perihelion was passed was varied for different particles with a step @xmath25=1 day or @xmath25=0.1 day near the actual value of @xmath24 for the comet .",
    "comet 10p is an example of a typical jupiter - family comet moving inside jupiter s orbit ; comet 39p moves outside jupiter s orbit .",
    "comet 2p is the only known high - eccentricity comet with aphelion distance @xmath26@xmath274.2 au .",
    "it comes close to the sun and produces a lot of dust .",
    "our initial data for dust particles are different from those in previous papers , and the parent comets producing dust are different ( exclusive of comet 2p ) from those considered earlier .",
    "we calculated how the solar spectrum was changed after the light was scattered by the dust particles and observed at earth .",
    "this was carried out by first considering all orbital elements of dust particles during a single run , which were stored in computer memory with a step @xmath28 ( see the previous section ) .",
    "based on these stored orbital elements , we calculated velocities and positions of particles and the earth during the dynamical lifetimes of the particles . for each pair of positions of a particle and the earth ,",
    "we then calculated many ( @xmath1010@xmath29 - 10@xmath30 , depending on a run ) different positions of the particle and the earth during the period @xmath31 of revolution of the particle around the sun , assuming that orbital elements do not vary during @xmath31 .",
    "this number is smaller for runs with larger maximum dynamical lifetimes of particles .",
    "the model , which is based on all positions and velocities of dust particles during their dynamical lifetimes , represents the zodiacal cloud for the case when small bodies continuously produce dust at a constant rate along their orbits ; seasonal effects and jumps in production of dust are not considered in this model .",
    "the model allows one to study the principal differences between spectra corresponding to particles produced by asteroids , comets , and trans - neptunian objects .",
    "more complicated models to study the fractions of particles of different origin can be considered in the future .",
    "the choice of a scattering function was based on analyses of dependences of scattering functions on angles @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see below ) and wavelength presented in several papers ( e.g. , giese 1963 ; giese & dziembowski 1969 ; leinert 1975 ; leinbert et al .",
    "1976 ; weiss - wrana 1983 ; hong 1985 ; lamy & perrin 1986 ) , which mainly followed the mie theory for scattering .",
    "the scattering function depends on the composition of particles , their sizes , and other factors . however , we considered three simple scattering functions : ( 1 ) @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and @xmath36(@xmath37)@xmath29 for @xmath38 , where @xmath32 is the angle between the earth and the sun , as viewed from the particle in radians and @xmath39/3 radian ; ( 2 ) @xmath40 having the same functional form as above , but with @xmath32 replaced by elongation @xmath33 , the angle between the particle and the sun , as viewed from the earth ( eastward from the sun ) ; ( 3 ) isotropic scattering .",
    "for all three functions , the intensity @xmath41 of light that reaches the earth was considered to be proportional to @xmath42@xmath21@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the distance between the particle and the earth , @xmath45 is the distance between the particle and the sun , and @xmath0 is the wavelength of light .",
    "since we considered the scattering near a single spectral line , wavelength @xmath0 in our runs was essentially a constant .",
    "except for lines of sight close to the sun , these three scattering functions give virtually the same results ( see below ) .",
    "since the differences between the functions that we considered were much greater than the differences between scattering functions presented in the publications cited above , we conclude that we need not worry about the precise form of the scattering .    for each particle position , we calculated the velocity relative to the sun , the velocity relative to the earth , and its respective distance to the earth and to the sun , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . these parameters and the scattering function",
    "were then used to construct the solar spectrum received at the earth after light had been scattered by all the particles located within some limited solid angle ( beam ) along a line of sight from the earth .",
    "the direction of the beam is characterized by its eastern elongation from the sun @xmath33 , and by its inclination above the ecliptic plane .",
    "particles in beams of diameter 2@xmath19 ( fig . 1 ) and 2.5@xmath19 ( other figures ) were considered .",
    "projections of relative velocities of particles on the lines of sight from the earth and the sun to particles were used for analysis of the doppler shift . in each run , particles all had the same size , the same @xmath1 , and the same source ( e.g. , asteroidal ) .",
    "figure  1 shows sample spectra of scattered mg  i @xmath05184 obtained from these calculations toward sightlines in the antisolar direction ( fig .",
    "1a , c ) and toward the ecliptic pole ( fig .",
    "the spectra consist of intensity vs. wavelength shift @xmath46 with respect to 5183.62 angstrom .",
    "the thinnest line in figure 1 denotes the initial ( unscattered ) solar spectrum . for asteroidal ( ast ) and comet encke ( ` 2p ' ) particles , the solar spectrum received at the earth is found to be nearly independent of the scattering function , while for trans - neptunian ( ` tn ' ) particles , the results for scattering function ( 3 ) , denoted as ` tn3 ' , differ slightly from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , denoted as ` tn 1 ' and tn 2 , respectively . in the legend in the figure , the first number ( 0.2 in fig .",

    "the wham observations are also presented for comparison . these observations and all other plots in figure  1c ,",
    "d were stretched so that the minimum in the line was at approximately the same depth as that for the initial solar spectrum .",
    "the continuum levels were also set to be the same ( equal to 1 ) for all plots .",
    "similar plots at @xmath33=90@xmath19 and @xmath33=270@xmath19 for zero inclination above the ecliptic plane were presented by ipatov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . unlike results by clarke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who considered spectrum near 4861 angstrom ( @xmath47 line of hydrogen ) , our modeled spectra do nt exhibit strong asymmetry .",
    "we similary found that minima in the plots of dependencies of the intensity of light on its wavelength near 5184 angstrom are not as deep as those for the initial solar spectrum .",
    "note that the value of @xmath33 in the paper by clarke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is measured in the opposite clockwise direction than in our present paper , so our 90@xmath19 corresponds to 270@xmath19 in their paper .    at the north",
    "ecliptic pole , the calculated spectrum was shifted slightly to the left relative to the solar spectrum for asteroidal particles and slightly to the right ( to the red ) for particles originating from comet 2p ( fig .",
    "these shifts may be due to small asymmetries in the model particle distributions with respect to the ecliptic plane .",
    "the spectra of 10p and 39p particles and those from long - period comets were very similar to each other .",
    "for cometary particles , the line profile has a flatter bottom than that for asteroidal particles , but it was not so wide as the observed spectrum presented in ( reynolds et al .",
    "none of our model runs matched the large width of the observation toward the ecliptic pole .",
    "this issue will not be addressed in this paper , but will be a topic for future investigation .",

    "the plot of this characteristic velocity vs. the solar elongation @xmath33 along the ecliptic plane is called the ` velocity - elongation ' plot . for ` velocity - elongation ' plots marked by @xmath48 , we considered the shift of the centroid ( the ` center of mass ' of the line ) , while ` velocity - elongation ' plots marked by @xmath49 denote the shift of the minimum of the line . `",
    "velocity - elongation ' plots for different scattering functions are denoted as @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the scattering function 1 , as @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the function 2 , and as @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the function 3 .",
    "the lines in figure 1 are nearly symmetric , so the results for ` c ' and ` m ' in figure 2 differ only a little .",
    "brief discussions of ` velocity - elongation ' plots obtained in our runs with observations have been made by ipatov et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , madsen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and ipatov and mather ( 2006a ) .",
    "below we compare the ` velocity - elongation ' plots in more details .",
    "the details of the model spectra depend on @xmath33 , @xmath1 , @xmath18 , and the source of particles .",
    "different particles populations produce clearly distinct model spectra of the zodiacal light .",
    "the ` velocity - elongation ' plots obtained for different scattering functions were similar at 30@xmath19@xmath27@xmath33@xmath27330@xmath19 ( fig .",
    "2 ) ; though the difference was greater for directions close to the sun .",
    "some jumps in the plots are caused by small number statistics for these runs . in figures 3 - 8 the results",
    "were obtained using only the second scattering function .    a comparison of the observed ` velocity - elongation ' plot with those obtained from our model for dust particles of different sizes ( i.e. , different values of @xmath1 ) produced by asteroids , comets ( 2p / encke , 10p / tempel 2 , 39p / oterma , long - period ) , and trans - neptunian objects allowed us to draw some conclusions about the sources of zodiacal dust particles .",
    "asteroidal , trans - neptunian , and 2p particles populations produce clearly distinct model spectra of the zodiacal light .",
    "the differences between ` velocity - elongation ' plots for several sources of dust reached its maximum at @xmath33 between 90@xmath19 and 120@xmath19 ( figs .",
    "36 ) . for future observations of velocity shifts in of the zodiacal spectrum",
    ", it will be important to pay particular attention to these elongations .",
    "we consider the amplitude of ` velocity - elongation ' curves as @xmath56=(@xmath57-@xmath58)/2 , where @xmath58 and @xmath57 are the minimum and maximum values of velocities at 90@xmath19@xmath27@xmath33@xmath27270@xmath19 .",
    "the observational value of @xmath56 is about 12 km / s ( if we smooth the plot ) . for several dust sources , the characteristic values of @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57",
    "are presented in table 1 .",
    "mean eccentricities @xmath59 and mean inclinations @xmath60 at distance from the sun 1@xmath2@xmath45@xmath23 au are also included in the table . for asteroidal dust ,",
    "the ` velocity - elongation ' plots had lower amplitudes than the observations ( fig .",
    "b ) . the plots obtained at different @xmath1 differed little from each other , especially at @xmath1@xmath270.01 . for 10p particles , the ` velocity - elongation ' amplitudes",
    "were also lower than that of the observations ( fig .",
    "the difference between the plots obtained for 10p particles at different @xmath1 was greater than that for asteroidal particles , but was usually less than that for other sources of particles considered .",
    "on the other hand , the ` velocity - elongation ' curve corresponding to particles produced by comet 2p have slightly larger amplituides than the observed curve ( fig .",
    "so perhaps a combination of cometary 2p dust particles and asteroidal particles could provide a result that is close to the observational ` velocity - elongation ' curve .",
    "the velocity amplitudes @xmath56 for particles originating from long - period comets are much greater than those for the observational curve ( fig .",
    "the orbit of comet 39p is located outside jupiter s orbit .",
    "studies of the migration of 39p particles thus give some information about the the migration of particles originating beyond neptune s orbit that have reached the orbit of jupiter . for 39p particles and 0.01@xmath2@xmath1@xmath20.2 at 60@xmath19@xmath27@xmath33@xmath27@xmath61 , ` velocity - elongation ' amplitudes were smaller than those for the observations ( fig .",
    "5a ) , while for @xmath1@xmath20.004 , the curves more closely match the observations ( fig .",
    "5b ) . for such small @xmath1 ,",
    "only a small number of particles entered inside jupiter s orbit , and statistics were poor .",
    "the distribution of particles over their orbital elements could be somewhat different if we had considered a greater number @xmath12 of particles in one run , but the difference between the curves obtained at different @xmath12 will not be more than the difference between the curves obtained at adjacent values of @xmath1 presented in the figure . at @xmath1=0.0001 , particles spent on average more time in the zodiacal cloud than for other runs , but it was due mainly only to one particle , which during about 9 myr moved inside jupiter s orbit before its collision with the sun .",
    "in reality such a particle could sublimate or be destroyed in collisions during its dynamical lifetime .",
    "small number statistics may also be responsible for the spread of results for the trans - neptunian dust in figure 6a .",
    "if there had been a greater number of particles in the runs , the differences between the corresponding plots would probably have been smaller .",
    "there was a zero vertical shift for the observational plot .",
    "plots for asteroidal , 10p , and 39p particles are shifted a little down , and that for 2p particles was shifted up relative to the observational plot .",
    "so a combination of different sources of particles could give a zero vertical shift .",
    "for trans - neptunian dust particles , velocity amplitudes @xmath56 were greater than the observational values at @xmath1@xmath130.05 and were about the same at @xmath1=0.01 ( fig .",
    "so together with cometary particles , trans - neptunian particles can compensate small values of @xmath56 for asteroidal particles . the difference between different plots in fig . 6a",
    "may be caused partly by small statistics , as only a few trans - neptunian particles in each run ( at fixed @xmath1 ) entered inside jupiter s orbit .",
    "the observational plot was mainly inside the region covered by trans - neptunian plots obtained for different @xmath1 , but at 180@xmath19@xmath27@xmath33@xmath27270@xmath19 it was mainly above the trans - neptunian curves .",
    "in the future we plan to explore the fractions of particles of different origin in the overall dust population based on various observations and taking into account a model for the size distribution of particles . here",
    "we present estimates based on a much simpler , two - component zodiacal dust cloud that fits the observations .",
    "for example , with a velocity amplitude @xmath56=9 km / s for asteroidal dust and at @xmath56=14 km / s for 2p particles , the fraction @xmath62 of asteroidal dust would need to be 40% . if all of the cometary particles in the zodiacal dust were from long - period comets ( @xmath56=33 km / s ) , then @xmath62 = 88% .",
    "the contribution of _ lp _ particles to the zodiacal light can not be large also because their inclinations are large and iras observations showed ( liou et al .",
    "1995 ) that most of the zodiacal light is due to particles with inclinations @xmath63@xmath2730@xmath19 . at @xmath1@xmath130.004 ,",
    "_ lp _ particles are quickly ejected from the solar system , so among zodiacal dust we can find only _ lp _ particles greater than 100 @xmath7 m .",
    "the contribution of _ lp _ particles to the total mass of the zodiacal cloud is greater than their contribution to the brightness @xmath41 , as a surface of a particle of radius @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath65 , and its mass @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath67 ( i.e. , @xmath68@xmath69@xmath64 ) .",
    "dynamical lifetimes of _ lp _ particles at @xmath1@xmath20.002 ( i.e. , at diameters greater than 200 @xmath7 m ) can exceed several myrs ( i.e. , exceed mean lifetimes of asteroidal and 2p particles ) , so the fraction of _ lp _ particles in the zodiacal cloud can be greater than their fraction in the new particles that were produced by small bodies or came from other regions of the solar system . dynamical lifetimes of dust particles are greater for smaller @xmath64 ( ipatov and mather 2006a ) , and some particles can be destroyed in collisions with other particles .",
    "so the mass distributions of particles produced by small bodies are different from the mass distributions of particles located at different distances from the sun .",
    "a significant fraction of cometary dust in the near - earth space was proposed by liou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and zook ( 2001 ) .",
    "liou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) based his estimates of the fraction of cometary dust ( 3/4 to 2/3 ) on comparison of the migration of 9 @xmath7 m diameter dust particles that produced by comet encke - type parent bodies with the iras observations of the shape of the zodiacal cloud .",
    "based on cratering rates from an ensemble of earth- and lunar - orbiting satellites , zook ( 2001 ) estimated that the cometary contribution to the near - earth flux of particles is @xmath1075% .",
    "ozernoy ( 2001 ) compared the computer simulation results of migration of 1 @xmath7 m and 5 @xmath7 m dust particles with the cobe / dirbe data and showed that the trans - neptunian dust contributes as much as @xmath101/3 of the total number density near the earth .",
    "grogan et al . ( 2001 ) suggested that at least 30% of zodiacal dust comes from the break - up of asteroids in order to explain formation of dust bands .",
    "the conclusions on a considerable fraction of cometary dust are also in agreement with earlier studies of the dynamics of jupiter - family comets ( ipatov & mather 2003 , 2004a - b , 2006a ) , which showed that some former cometary objects could get high eccentric orbits located entirely inside jupiter s orbit and move in such orbits for a long time",
    ". some of these objects could disintegrate producing a substantial amount of dust .",
    "comparison of the number density of migrating dust particles with the observation that number density is constant at 3 - 18 au from the sun ( ozernoy 2001 , landgraf 2002 , ipatov & mather 2005 , 2006a ) is also consistent with that a fraction of cometary dust particles is significant ( perhaps dominant ) inside saturn s orbit .",
    "observations by reynolds et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also provided the fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of the mg  i line in the zodiacal light . in figure 7 , their values are marked by crosses .",

    "the mean width usually is even less than that for 2p particles at the same @xmath1 .",
    "as it is summarized in figure 8 , the fwhm for asteroidal dust is significantly less than the 77  km / s fwhm of the observations . to fit the observations , we need to consider a significant fraction of cometary particles .",
    "2p particles and particles started from long - period comets provided large values of the width in most runs , but the width varied considerably in such runs depending on @xmath1 and the place of start ( i.e. , the value of true anomaly ) from the comet .",
    "in order to understand the variations in the model line profiles with the source and size of particles , we examined the values of mean eccentricities and mean orbital inclinations of particles at different distances @xmath45 from the sun ( figs .",
    "these data show that , in general , the velocity amplitudes of the mg  i line are greater for greater mean eccentricities and inclinations , but they depend also on distributions of particles over their orbital elements .    the main contribution to the brightness of a dust cloud observed at the earth is from particles located at @xmath45@xmath273 au . therefore , because only positions of particles at @xmath45@xmath131 au are used for calculation of the brightness of particles at 90@xmath19@xmath2@xmath33@xmath2@xmath75 , if it is not mentioned specially , the mean eccentricities @xmath59 and orbital inclinations @xmath60 refer to 1@xmath2@xmath45@xmath23 au . at @xmath33=270@xmath19 prograde particles",
    "move in the same direction as the earth , but usually slower because they are located father from the sun than the earth .",
    "therefore , velocities of mg  i line are usually positive at @xmath33=90@xmath19 and negative at @xmath33=270@xmath19 .",
    "the values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57 for particles from different sources are presented in table 1 for several values of @xmath1 .",
    "this table and figures  3 - 6 , 9 - 12 show that at @xmath59@xmath270.5 ( e.g. , for particles started from asteroids and comet 10p ) the velocity amplitudes @xmath56 are usually smaller than the observed amplitude ( 12 km / s ) , while for some runs at @xmath59@xmath760.5 ( e.g. , for runs 2p and _ lp _ ) , @xmath56 is greater than the observed amplitude .",
    "thus the wham observations correspond to a mean orbital eccentricity @xmath59 of about 0.5 .",
    "however , the velocity amplitudes of the line depend not only on @xmath59 , but also on the distribution of all orbital elements of dust particles . for example , for trans - neptunian particles at 0.05@xmath2@xmath1@xmath20.4",
    ", we have relatively large amplitudes ( @xmath56@xmath1616 km / s ) , even though @xmath59@xmath270.5 ; the values of @xmath60 in this case were a little greater than for other sources of particles at @xmath59@xmath270.5 .",
    "also , for trans - neptunian particles , the values of @xmath56 were smaller at @xmath1=0.01 than at 0.05@xmath2@xmath1@xmath20.4 , though @xmath59 was greater at @xmath1=0.01 .",
    "the velocity amplitudes also depend on inclinations , because high inclination orbits have smaller projections of their orbital velocities on the lines of sight from the earth and the sun to particles near the ecliptic plane . for particles originating from long - period comets ( _ lp _ particles ) , the values of @xmath56 are significantly greater than those for dust particles from other sources , and the values of @xmath60 ( @xmath76105@xmath19 ) were much greater than for other runs . for _ lp _ runs at @xmath1=0.002 and @xmath73=0.9 au , @xmath59 was smaller ( @xmath270.25 ) than in most other runs , but @xmath56 was large ( 41 km / s ) , because @xmath60 was large ( 154 - 160@xmath19 ) .",
    "note that mean initial inclinations for _ lp _ runs were about 90@xmath19 ( initial orbital inclinations were distributed uniformly between 0 and 180@xmath19 ) , but the mean inclinations of migrating particles were greater than 90@xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "the velocities of mg  i line depend not only on mean eccentricities and inclinations of particles , but also on the distributions of the orbital elements .",
    "the distribution of orbital parameters and the resulting scattered line profile is dependent upon @xmath1 , because @xmath1 influences the lifetime of the particle . dynamical lifetimes of particles are greater for smaller @xmath1 . in the case of particles started from comet 2p , for runs presented in figures 13a , c , d , the maximum lifetimes were less than 5 kyr , and for runs presented in fig .",
    "13b , f they were about 50 - 60 kyr .",
    "particles that migrate more slowly into the sun ( smaller @xmath1 ) interact with planets for a longer time , and therefore they exhibit a wider range of parameter values , even though they have the same origin .",
    "this explains the difference between the plots in figure  13 obtained at different @xmath1 ( wider range of @xmath77 was obtained at smaller @xmath1 ) .",
    "as the motion is stochastic and the number of particles in our runs is not large , there may be no strict dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "the plots of the velocities of mgi line for ` 2p 0.25 t ' and ` 2p 0.5 t ' runs presented in fig .",
    "4c - d are higher than the observational line at large @xmath1 . in this case , all eccentricities are large at @xmath78@xmath761 au ( fig .",
    "13a , c , d ) , lifetimes of all particles are close to each other and are very short ( @xmath275 kyr ) , and all particles moved practically in the same way . for @xmath1=0.05 ,",
    "the maximum lifetime of 2p - particles started at aphelion ( ` 2p 0.5 t ' run ) was greater by a factor of 4 than that for ` 2p 0.25 t ' run .",
    "therefore for @xmath1=0.05 , variations in @xmath77 at the same @xmath78 were greater for ` 2p 0.5 t ' run than for ` 2p 0.25 t ' run .",
    "for many particles other than 2p particles , lifetimes are several tens or several hundreds of thousands of years and can reach tens of millions of years ( ipatov and mather 2006a ) . besides",
    ", more particles start from comet 2p in its perihelion ( in this case , the plots do not differ much from the observational plot even at large @xmath1 ) than in aphelion .",
    "therefore the zodiacal light contribution is very small for particles with @xmath1@xmath130.05 started from comet 2p at aphelion or in the middle of the orbit .",
    "finally , we examine the number density @xmath79 of particles with distance @xmath45 from the sun . in figures 14a - c",
    "we present the values of @xmath80 in @xmath81 for @xmath45 equal to 0.3 and 1 au ( a ) , at @xmath45=0.8 and @xmath45=1.2 au ( b ) , and at @xmath45 equal to 1 and 3 au ( c ) .",
    "these results can then be compared to values of @xmath80 deduced from observations of the actual zodiacal cloud .",
    "the micrometeoroid flux ( @xmath82 g - @xmath83 g , i.e. , at @xmath9@xmath275 @xmath7 m for @xmath4=2.5 g/@xmath8 , or at @xmath1@xmath130.1 ) measured on board helios 1 during 1975 is compatible with a number density @xmath84 at distance @xmath45 from the sun between 0.3 and 1 au ( grn et al .",

    "pioneer 10 observations between the earth s orbit and the asteroid belt yielded @xmath85 for particles of mass @xmath10@xmath83 g ( reach 1992 ) .",
    "note that in our models , at 0.3@xmath2@xmath45@xmath21 au and 0.001@xmath2@xmath1@xmath20.2 all values of @xmath80 exceed 1.9 for 2p - particles and are smaller than 1.1 for asteroidal particles ( fig .",
    "at @xmath1@xmath130.005 , the values of @xmath80 for particles started from other considered comets were less than 1.5 , but were mainly greater than those for asteroidal particles .",
    "we can get @xmath80=1.3 for two component dust cloud if we consider 86% of particles with @xmath80=1.1 and 14% of particles with @xmath80=2 .",
    "so the fraction of 2p particles needed to fit the helios observations can be less than 15% . at @xmath1@xmath130.1 and 0.8@xmath2@xmath45@xmath21.2 au ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath80 for all points in figure 14b was a little smaller than 1.5 .",
    "for cometary dust , @xmath80 was mainly greater than for asteroidal dust ; this difference was greater at @xmath1@xmath20.05 than for @xmath1@xmath130.1 . at @xmath1@xmath20.2 ,",
    "the values of @xmath80 for 2p - particles were greater than for other sources of dust .",
    "at 1@xmath2@xmath45@xmath23 au for most of the dust sources , the values of @xmath80 were mainly greater than 1.5 ( fig .",
    "for 0.1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath20.2 , the values of @xmath80 for particles started from trans - neptunian objects and comet 39p better fit the observational value of 1.5 than those for particles from other sources ( including asteroidal dust ) .",
    "so our studies of the distributions of particles over @xmath45 and of the velocities of mg  i line testify that a fraction of trans - neptunian particles among zodiacal dust particles can be considerable .",
    "our study of velocities and widths of the scattered mg  i line in the zodiacal light is based on the distributions of positions and velocities of migrating dust particles originating from various solar system sources .",
