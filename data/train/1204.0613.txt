    "discovery of superconductivity in the iron - based ` 1111 ' pnictides @xcite boosted renewal of research activities in the field , resulting a number of iron containing superconductors with different transition temperatures , the maximum being about 55 k for the smfeaso system @xcite . among these",
    ", the fese ( the 11-type chalcogenide ) shows lowest superconducting transition temperature ( t@xmath68 k ) , however , could be considered as a model system to address basic characteristics of these materials @xcite .",
    "the fese structure contains simple stacking of tetrahedrally coordinated fese@xmath7 layers without spacer layers that are known to have substantial effect on the electronic properties @xcite .",
    "susbstitution by te in the fese leads to a marginal increase in the t@xmath3 ( @xmath4 15 k ) , however , the system gets phase separated and the nanoscale structure is characterized by different iron - chalcogen bondlengths @xcite . on the other hand , the superconducting transition temperature of the fese shows large enhancement up to @xmath437 k under the hydrostatic pressure @xcite . a large pressure sensitivity of the fese indicates chemical pressure being a potential alternative parameter for raising its t@xmath3 .",
    "indeed , superconductivity at a t@xmath3 as high as 32 k has been observed recently in a k - intercalated fese @xcite , triggering new studies on the iron - based chalcogenides . later , similar t@xmath3 has been observed in the rb@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 @xcite , ( tl , k)fe@xmath9se@xmath2 @xcite and cs@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 @xcite compounds",
    ".    there appears a substantial charge transfer between the active fese blocks and the intercalated spacer layers in the k@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 , with electrons from the k@xmath10 ions filling the hole bands at the zone center .",
    "thus , the fermi surface of k@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 is made by only the electron pockets around the m points @xcite , and hence the scenario based on the nesting between electron and hole pockets , usually argued to understand the iron pnictides , looses its ground @xcite . on the other hand , although isostructural to the 122-type bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 pnictides , the k@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 has distinct microstructure , characterized by an iron - vacancy order and a phase separation @xcite .",
    "the magnetic order with a remarkably large iron magnetic moment co - exists with bulk superconductivity @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are experimental indications on the relation between the superconductivity and the iron - vacancy disorder , with a completely ordered state being an insulator .",
    "these facts point out that a complete knowledge of the nanoscale structure is needed for describing the fundamental electronic structure of these materials .    extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) , an atomic site - specific experimental probe @xcite , has been widely used to study local structure of different materials , including the copper oxide superconductors and related systems @xcite .",
    "exafs has also been exploited to study the new iron - based superconductors , revealing important information on the atomic correlations between different layers @xcite and temperature dependent local structural anomalies across the superconducting transition @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have applied exafs to study the local structure of fese@xmath11te@xmath8 chalcogenides , providing direct evidence of phase separation in the ternary systems , characterized by different fe - se and fe - te distances @xcite . in the present study , we have used polarized exafs to explore the local structure of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductor .",
    "the results of polarized exafs at the fe and se k - edges reveal large local disorder similar to the amorphous / glass materials .",
    "the local structure of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is significantly different from the local structure of the binary fese @xcite superconductor .",
    "while the local force constant of fe - se bondlength ( k@xmath45.8 ev / @xmath5 ) is similar in the two systems , the one for the fe - fe bondlength appears to sustain substantial changes due to k intercalation ( k@xmath43.5 ev / @xmath5 and k@xmath42.1 ev / @xmath5 respectively for fese and k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 systems ) , consistent with a partial relaxation of the fe - fe networks due to the k - intercalation .",
    "the experimental results suggest that glass physics should have distinct role in the understanding of these superconductors .",
    "x - ray absorption measurements were performed at the beamline bm23 in the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , grenoble on well characterized single crystal of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system .",
    "the single crystal was grown by melting a precursor of fese and k placed in an alumina crucible , that itself was sealed into an arc - welded stainless steel tube .",
    "the details on the crystal growth and characterization for superconducting , structural and transport properties are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a platelike and dark - shining as grown single crystal with t@xmath3=31.8 k was selected and detailed synchrotron x - ray diffraction study @xcite was performed prior to the x - ray absorption measurements .",
    "the synchrotron radiation emitted by a bending magnet source at 6 gev esrf storage ring was monochromatized by a double crystal si(311 ) monochromator .",
    "the polarized exafs measurements at the fe and se k - edges were acquired in the normal incidence ( with polarization parallel to the ab - plane and hereafter called e@xmath12ab polarization ) and in the grazing incidence geometry ( 10 degree off the e@xmath12c and hereafter called e@xmath12c polarization ) .",
    "fluorescence mode was used ( exploiting a multi - element ge - detector system ) for the measurements .",
    "the samples were mounted in a continuous flow he cryostat and the temperature was controlled and monitored within an accurancy of @xmath131 k. several spectral scans were acquired at each temperature to ensure the reproducibility of the measurements .",
    "standard procedure was used to extract the exafs signal from the absorption spectrum @xcite and corrected for the fluorescence self - absorption before the analysis @xcite .",
    "12.5 cm    figure 1 shows fourier transform ( ft ) magnitudes of the polarized exafs oscillations , measured at the se and fe k - edges on k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystal .",
    "the ft magnitudes provide partial atomic distribution around the se and fe in the direction of x - ray beam polarizations .",
    "se k - edge exafs , measured in the e@xmath12ab polarization shows only the contribution from the nearest neighbour fe atoms at a distance @xmath42.4 @xmath14 ( main peak in the ft at @xmath42 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the next nearest neighbours of se in the e@xmath12ab geometry are k ( r=3.45  ) , se ( r=3.91 and 4.02  ) and fe ( r=4.62  ) atoms , and their contributions are expected to appear at @xmath43.0 - 4.5 @xmath14 ( upper panel ) . on the other hand , the fe site nearest neighbours are se ( at a distance @xmath42.4  ) and fe ( at a distance @xmath4 2.7  ) in the e@xmath12ab polarization ( lower panel ) .",
    "the contribution of the fe - fe is not expected in the e@xmath12c polarization and the main peak in the ft in this geometry should be merely due to fe - se bonds ( middle panel ) .",
    "contributions of fe next near neighbours are expected to appear at longer distances ( r@xmath15=3.91 @xmath14 , r@xmath16=4.02 @xmath14 and r@xmath17=4.62 @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , the main peak in the ft of the fe k - edge exafs in the e@xmath12ab geometry contains information on the fe - se and fe - fe bonds ( lower panel ) while the one in the e@xmath12c have contribution only of fe - se bonds ( middle panel ) , similar to the main ft peak of the se k - edge exafs ( upper panel ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "apart from the nearest neighbours , contribution expected from the farther atoms is apparently absent ( or within the noise level ) .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of highly disordered systems and amorphous materials @xcite .",
    "we will come back to discuss this , however , before that let us make a comparison between the local structure of fese and the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "10.5 cm    figure 2 compares fourier transforms ( ft ) of the fe and se k - edge exafs signals ( t=60 k ) measured on the polycrystalline fese sample @xcite and the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 crystal in the e@xmath12ab geometry .",
    "the fe nearest neighbour in the fese are se at a distance of @xmath42.4 @xmath14 and fe atoms at a distance @xmath4 2.7 @xmath14 ( two peak structure at @xmath41.5 - 3.0@xmath14 ) , similar to the case of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 . significantly intense features between 3 - 6 @xmath18 are due to longer fe - fe ( @xmath43.8 @xmath18 ) and fe - se distances , and the multiple scatterings involving different near neighbours of the fe atoms . similarly , in the se",
    "k - edge exafs of the fese we expect contribution from four fe nearest neighbours at a distance @xmath42.4 @xmath14 ( as in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ) .",
    "the next nearest neighbours are se and fe atoms and contributions of these distant shells clearly appear as a multiple structured peak at @xmath43.0 - 4.5 @xmath14 .",
    "the comparison underlines significant differences in the local structure of the fese and the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 systems .",
    "in particular , the ft of the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 show only a single peak at @xmath42 @xmath14 that contains contribution from the fe - se distances ( @xmath42.4  ) in the se k - edge exafs and , fe - se and fe - fe contributions in the fe k - edge exafs .",
    "the longer distances contributions are apparently absent in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system .",
    "also , the ft magnitude due to similar nearest neighbours is much weaker in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the contribution from the fe - fe distances in the fe k - edge exafs is strongly damped , indicating a large fe site disorder .",
    "apparently the exafs data reveal large overall local disorder in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system , commonly seen in the local structure of amorphous systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the measured k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 sample is a very good single crystal , evident from sharp diffraction peaks @xcite , and such a large disorder in the local structure indicates that the system should be a some kind of glass .",
    "coming back , it is clear that only the nearest neighbours ( i.e. , fe - se and fe - fe bondlengths ) contributions are visible in both fe and se k - edge exafs .",
    "therefore our focus should be limited to these bondlengths . in the single - scattering approximation ,",
    "the exafs amplitude is described by the following general equation @xcite : @xmath19\\nonumber\\ ] ] where n@xmath20 = 3 cos@xmath5 @xmath21 is the number of neighbouring atoms at a distance r@xmath20 at an angle @xmath21 with respect to the x - ray beam polarization .",
    "s@xmath22 is the passive electrons reduction factor , f@xmath20(k , r@xmath20 ) is the backscattering amplitude , @xmath23 is the photoelectron mean free path , @xmath24 is the phase shift , and @xmath25 is the correlated debye - waller factor ( dwf ) measuring the mean square relative displacements ( msrds ) of the photoabsorber - backscatterer pairs .",
    "excurve 9.275 code ( with calculated backscattering amplitudes and phase shift functions ) is used for the exafs model fits @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained with winxas package @xcite in which the backscattering amplitudes and phase shifts were calculated using feff @xcite .",
    "the e@xmath26 , n@xmath20 and s@xmath22 were fixed after a number of trials on different exafs scans with structural input from diffraction studies @xcite . only the radial distances r@xmath20 and the corresponding @xmath25 , were allowed to vary in the least squares model fits for the temperature dependent study .",
    "a single shell ( i.e. , fe - se ) was used to model the e@xmath12ab polarized se k - edge exafs and e@xmath12c polarized fe k - edge exafs . on the other hand ,",
    "two shells ( i.e. , fe - se and fe - fe ) were necessary to model the e@xmath12ab polarized fe k - edge exafs .",
    "the number of independent data points , n@xmath27(2@xmath28k@xmath28r)/@xmath29 @xcite were about 17 - 18 ( @xmath28k=11 - 12 @xmath30 and @xmath28r=2.4  ) , in the two parameters ( four parameters ) fits for the e@xmath12ab se k - edge and e@xmath12c fe k - edge exafs ( e@xmath12ab fe k - edge exafs ) .",
    "the model fits are shown as insets to the fig .",
    "8.0 cm    figure 3 shows temperature dependence of the local bondlengths determined by fe k and se k - edge exafs analysis .",
    "the fe - se distances determined by exafs data in different polarizations on two edges are similar within experimental uncertainties ( upper panel ) . however , both fe - se and fe - fe distances ( lower panel ) appear slightly shorter than the average bondlengths determined by diffraction studies @xcite .",
    "this may be due to largely disordered structure , as seen in the glasses @xcite .",
    "the fe - se bondlength hardly shows any change with temperature unlike the fe - fe distance ( describing the in - plane lattice parameter ) that varies with temperature showing relative flexibility of the later .",
    "9.0 cm    figure 4 shows the correlated debye waller factors ( @xmath31 ) , i.e. , the msrds of the fe - se and the fe - fe pairs as a function of temperature for the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , compared with the @xmath31 of the two bondlengths for the binary fese system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 measured by exafs ( represents distance broadening ) is sum of temperature independent ( @xmath32 ) and temperature dependent terms , i.e. @xmath31=@xmath32+@xmath31(t ) . while the @xmath32 ( @xmath40.0002 ) for the fe - se pairs in the e@xmath12ab polarization remains small ( approximately similar to the case of the one in the binary fese )",
    ", the @xmath32 ( @xmath40.002 ) for the e@xmath12c is quite large .",
    "this merely indicates large disorder along the c - direction , likely to be due to the k - intercalation . also , the @xmath32 for the fe - fe is substantially large , a mere indicator of fe site disorder .",
    "on the other hand , temperature dependent @xmath31(t ) is well described by the correlated einstein model @xcite , an appropriate approximation for local mode vibrations .",
    "the einstein equation is given as : @xmath33 the einstein temperature ( @xmath34 , i.e. , the einstein frequency @xmath35 = @xmath36/@xmath37 ) for the fe - se pairs remains similar to the one in the binary fese system ( @xmath38318 k ) , indicating that local force constant ( k=@xmath39 , where k is the effective force constant and @xmath40 is reduced mass of the fe - se pair ) for the fe - se bonds is not very sensitive to the k- intercalation between the fese layers .",
    "the local force constant for fe - se bondlength is found to be k@xmath45.8 ev/@xmath41 , similar to the one in the binary fese superconductor . on the other hand",
    ", there is a substantial effect of intercalation on the einstein temperature ( local force constant ) of the fe - fe pairs , estimated to be @xmath4208 k ( k@xmath42.1 ev / @xmath5 ) and @xmath4268 k ( k@xmath43.5 ev / @xmath5 ) respectively for the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and the binary fese .",
    "therefore , it appears that the fe - fe bondlengths are relatively relaxed in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , consistent with a glassy nature of this system .",
    "considering the fact that the system is having a well defined crystal ordering , the glassy local structure could be due to freezing of iron vacancy order coupled with some other degrees of freedom .",
    "several measurements have undelined that the magnetic ordering in this system co - exists with the superconductivity with a large iron moments ( 3.3 @xmath42/fe ) ordered antiferromagnetically along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "present measurements reveal that there is ; i ) a large static disorder along the c - axis and ii ) a large fe - site disorder . in addition , the fe - fe network ( in - plane lattice parameter ) is relatively relaxed .",
    "therefore it appears plausible to think that a frozen state of c - axis disorder ( associated with local strain fields due to k - intercalation and iron vacancy order ) coupled with magnetic order is realized .",
    "this results into a magnetic texture with large frozen magnetic moment and a relaxed fe - fe network .",
    "thus , it is likely that the strain fields locally compress the fese - block and hence the t@xmath3 reaching to a value as high as 32 k , as it happens for fese under external pressure .",
    "indeed , single - crystal x - ray diffraction has shown a clear evidence of nanoscale phase separation between a majority magnetic phase with iron vacancy ordering , co - existing with a minority compressed phase @xcite .",
    "this situation is similar to granular superconductors in which a nanoscale superconducting phase coexisting in an insulating texture .",
    "therefore , the physics of the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system should be quite similar to the physics of glasses and granular superconductors .",
    "it should be recalled that the thermodynamic and kinetic fragility of a glass is related to the number of potential energy minima in the phase space and the heights of the activation energy barriers separating these minima .",
    "the fact that the superconductivity in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system is strongly dependent on its thermal history @xcite , a characteristic feature of glasses , further underlines glassy nature of this system .",
    "the observation of glassy nature puts the system in the category of granular superconductors , consistent with the superconductivity in a15 systems @xcite and recently observed fractal distribution enhanced superconductivity in superoxygenated la@xmath2cuo@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied local structure of the superconducting k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 chalcogenide by polarized fe and se k - edges exafs .",
    "the exafs data provide a clear evidence of large local disorder in this system .",
    "indeed the local structure of k@xmath43fe@xmath44se@xmath45 is similar to that of the amorphous materials indicating glassy nature of the system .",
    "the local bondlengths are found to be slightly shorter than the average diffraction distances , a characteristic feature of glasses .",
    "the mean square relative displacements ( msrd ) of fe - se and fe - fe bondlengths are well described by the correlated - einstein model with similar einstein - temperatures in all the polarizations , albeit the stastic component along the c - axis is much larger , likely to be due to substitutional disorder in the k layer .",
    "while the fe - se bondlengths remains highly covalent in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , similar to the one found in the binary fese superconductor , the fe - fe bondlength is charcaterized by much smaller force constant compared to the binary fese .",
    "such a local relaxation of the fe - fe bondlength results in a compression of the fese unit , as happens under external pressure , and hence the superconductivity at high t@xmath3 in the title system should be due to locally compressed nanoscale minority phase , coexisting with the normal magnetic phase , similar to the case of granular superconductors .",
    "+ : after finishing this manuscript we came across a very recent publication by tyson _",
    "et al _ @xcite reporting similar kind of measurements on the k@xmath0fe@xmath46se@xmath2 system finding a large disorder , similar to the one reported in this manuscript .",
    "however , tyson _",
    "et al _ have compared the data with the one obtained on 1111-iron pnictide unlike the present study in which a direct comparison with the binary fese has allowed us to clearly identify the effect on the local structure due to k - intercalation .",
    "therefore , the glassy nature revealed in these measurements should provide further insight to our understanding of these superconductors .",
    "the authors wishes to thank esrf staff for the help and support during the experimental runs .",
