    "qualitatively a net non - zero lepton asymmetry can be generated in any framework containing interactions that : ( @xmath9 ) break lepton number ; ( @xmath10 ) violate cp ; ( @xmath11 ) depart from thermal equilibrium at some stage in the cosmic evolution . in principle , these conditions are satisfied in any neutrino mass model in which light neutrinos acquire majorana masses and therefore in leptogenesis two unrelated puzzles , the origin of the cosmic baryon asymmetry and of neutrino masses , are linked together . in the standard approach , in which light neutrinos acquire majorana masses via the type i see - saw model  @xcite , leptogenesis takes place via the cp violating out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy standard model fermionic singlets  @xcite .",
    "this scenario for leptogenesis has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite and indeed a lot of progress in the understanding of the generation of the lepton asymmetry within this scenario has been achieved  @xcite .",

    "the lepton asymmetry is generated via the dynamics of either a scalar ( type ii ) or a majorana fermion ( type iii ) @xmath12 triplet and thus the major difference between these cases and the standard one arises from the fact that both , the scalar and fermion , couple to standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons . at high temperatures gauge reactions",
    "are much faster than the expansion rate of the universe implying that no asymmetry can be generated at this stage .",
    "as the temperature drops , thermalization of the triplet distribution becomes less efficient and depending on the strength of the yukawa interactions the generation of the lepton asymmetry can proceed either after the decoupling of gauge reactions or after the yukawa interactions freeze - out  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on leptogenesis in type iii see - saw ( fermionic triplet leptogenesis ) .",
    "in particular , we analyze the dynamics of lepton flavor in the generation of the lepton asymmetry and the implications that such effects could have for tev - scale triplets . as in the standard case when the lightest triplet mass ( @xmath13 ) is below",
    "@xmath14 gev the charged lepton yukawa interactions that are sufficiently fast project the lepton and anti - lepton quantum states produced in @xmath15 decays into their flavor components before they can re - scatter  @xcite . in the standard case the fermionic singlet dynamics",
    "is completely determined by yukawa reactions and accordingly the impact of flavor effects becomes well pronounced .",
    "in contrast , in the fermionic triplet leptogenesis case , since the dynamics of the triplet is not completely determined by its yukawa interactions , it is not entirely clear whether light flavor effects could yield a sizable enhancement of the final lepton asymmetry regardless of the strength of the yukawa reactions . here",
    "we will show that the inclusion of flavor may in general produce an enhancement of the asymmetry , but that relevant effects are possible only when the strength of the triplet yukawa interactions are such that they are still active when gauge reactions decouple .    in the case of a quasi - degenerate fermionic singlet mass spectrum",
    "the resonant enhancement of the cp violating asymmetry allows for successful leptogenesis even when the fermionic singlet masses are well below 1 tev  @xcite . in fermionic triplet leptogenesis on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency due to gauge reactions strongly depends on @xmath13 and it is drastically diminished when @xmath16 tev . in the one flavor approximation in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out that this constraint in conjunction with sphaleron decoupling implies that the correct amount of baryon asymmetry can only be generated for @xmath17 1.6 tev .",
    "as we will show , as long as leptogenesis proceeds through @xmath15 dynamics , this bound remains valid even when flavor effects are accounted for .",

    "we have shown that the requirement of successful @xmath15 leptogenesis constrains the dynamics of tev triplets to lie in the `` gauge regime '' , and therefore the inclusion of light lepton flavor effects in the calculation of the @xmath0 asymmetry has basically no significant effect .",
    "this implies that even after including flavor the bound @xmath250 1.6 tev , found in the one flavor approximation  @xcite , still holds .",
