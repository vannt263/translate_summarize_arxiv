    "spinal cord injury ( sci ) can leave the affected individuals with paraparesis or paraplegia , thus rendering them unable to ambulate .",
    "since there are currently no restorative treatments for this population , technological approaches have been sought to substitute for the lost motor functions .",
    "examples include robotic exoskeletons  @xcite , functional electrical stimulation ( fes ) systems  @xcite , and spinal cord stimulators  @xcite .",
    "however , these systems lack the able - body - like supraspinal control , and so the ambulation function of these devices is controlled manually .",
    "in addition to being unintuitive , these systems may be costly and cumbersome to use , and therefore have not yet garnered popular appeal and adoption among potential sci users . due to these limitations ,",
    "wheelchairs remain the primary means of mobility after sci .",
    "unfortunately , the extended reliance on wheelchairs typically lead to a wide variety of comorbidities that constitute the bulk of chronic sci - related medical care costs  @xcite .",
    "consequently , to address the above issues associated with the treatment of paraparesis and paraplegia after sci , novel brain - controlled prostheses are currently being pursued  @xcite .",
    "recent results by our group  @xcite suggest that an electroencephalogram ( eeg ) based brain - computer interface ( bci ) controlled lower extremity prosthesis may be feasible .",
    "more specifically , these studies demonstrated the successful implementation of a bci system that controls the ambulation of an avatar ( a stand - in for a lower extremity prosthesis ) within a virtual reality environment ( vre ) . by using a data - driven machine learning approach to decode the users kinesthetic motor imageries ( kmis ) , this bci - controlled walking simulator enabled a small group of subjects ( one with paraplegia due to sci  @xcite ) to achieve intuitive and purposeful bci control after a short training session .",
    "while the single sci subject outperformed most able - bodied subjects in this study , the operability of this system has not yet been tested in a sci population .",
    "the successful implementation of the bci - controlled walking simulator in a population of subjects with sci will establish the feasibility of future bci - controlled lower extremity prostheses and will represent an important step toward developing novel gait rehabilitation strategies for sci .    extending the application of the bci - controlled walking simulator to a sci population",
    "is faced with several problems .",
    "first , cortical reorganization , which is common after sci  @xcite , may cause the cortical representation of walking kmi to vary vastly from one sci subject to another .",
    "second , this representation may dramatically evolve over time when sci subjects are engaged in kmi training  @xcite .",
    "finally , subjects with sci may interpret walking kmi either as motor imagery or as attempted walking , which in turn may result in multiple patterns of cortical activation across these individuals .",
    "therefore , intuitive bci operation under these conditions requires a system that can accommodate for the variations of brain physiology across sci individuals , time , and strategies . to address these problems",
    ", we used a data - driven machine learning method to decode walking kmis in a small population of sci individuals .",
    "this approach enabled 5 subjects to achieve intuitive and self - paced operation of the bci - controlled walking simulator after only minimal training .",
    "furthermore , they were able to maintain this level of control over the course of several weeks .",
    "the goal of this study was to determine if individuals with complete motor sci can use intuitive control strategies to purposefully operate a bci - controlled walking simulator . to achieve this goal ,",
    "5 subjects with sci underwent a short training procedure where they performed alternating epochs of idling and walking kmi while their eeg were recorded .",
    "these training eeg data were then analyzed to build decoding models for subsequent online bci operation . to ascertain purposeful bci control ,",
    "subjects then performed 5 sessions of an online bci goal - oriented virtual walking task  @xcite .",
    "this entire procedure was performed 5 times over the course of several weeks to determine if subjects performances improved with additional practice .",
    "this study was approved by the university of california , irvine institutional review board .",
    "four subjects with paraplegia and one with tetraplegia due to sci were recruited via physician referral from the long beach veterans affairs spinal cord injury center and other sci outreach programs . the subjects ( see table 1 ) gave their informed consent to participate in the study .",
    "note that all subjects were bci nave and most of them performed the experimental procedures at a rate of once per week .",
    ".list of participants with demographic data and level of sci .",
    "asia = american spinal injury association impairment scale . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results of this study show that subjects with paraplegia or tetraplegia due to sci can operate a non - invasive bci - controlled avatar within a vre to accomplish a goal - oriented ambulation task .",
    "all subjects gained purposeful online bci control on the first day after undergoing a 10-min training session , with the exception of subject 2 , who did not attain control until day 2 .",
    "in addition , bci control was maintained and continued to improve over the course of the study .",
    "these findings suggest that a bci - controlled lower extremity prosthesis for either gait rehabilitation or restoration may be feasible .",
    "the offline classification accuracies varied across subjects and experimental days , but were significantly above the chance level performance ( 50% ) . similar to able - bodied subjects engaged in the same task  @xcite , a short 10-min training session was sufficient for the data - driven machine learning algorithm to generate accurate subject - specific eeg decoding models for this population .",
    "the topographic maps of these models ( e.g. fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 ) showed that the spatio - spectral features underlying the differences between walking and idling kmis varied across subjects and evolved over experimental days .",
    "the differences in the brain areas and eeg frequencies across subjects may be due to variations in cortical reorganization following sci  @xcite , or due to differences in imageries employed by each subject ( e.g. the kmi of walking instructions may have been interpreted differently by each subject ) . nevertheless , all subjects showed activation of mid - frontal areas , which likely overlay the pre - motor and supplementary motor areas , as well as the pre - frontal cortex .",
    "their activation during walking kmi is consistent with functional imaging findings , such as those in  @xcite .",
    "another common pattern across subjects was the presence of activity near bilateral , lateral central - parietal electrodes , which likely represents the arm sensorimotor areas .",
    "a similar pattern was observed in able - bodied individuals  @xcite , and is hypothesized to originate from arm swing imagery .",
    "finally , the evolution of the feature extraction maps over the 5 experimental days may be indicative of a neuro - plasticity process associated with practice and learning  @xcite .",
    "the spatio - temporal variations of walking kmi activation patterns demonstrate the necessity of a data - driven machine learning approach for rapid acquisition of intuitive bci control .",
    "first , our approach accommodates for the variations of these activity patterns across subjects , as well as their evolution over time .",
    "second , it facilitates rapid acquisition of online bci control , presumably by enabling subjects to utilize intuitive mental strategies .",
    "the user training time necessary to acquire purposeful bci control in this study is significantly shorter than those of other bci studies where users must learn a completely new cognitive skill to modulate pre - selected eeg features , such as the @xmath2-rhythm over lateral central areas  @xcite .",
    "finally , this approach carries a significant potential value in the future practical implementation of bci - prostheses , as it may drastically reduce the training time needed to attain purposeful and useful bci control from a timescale of weeks to months to one of minutes to days .",
    "this in turn may significantly reduce the cost of training users to operate future bci - prostheses .",
    "the results presented in table 4 show that once purposeful control was achieved , it was maintained in 96% of all online sessions . in addition , 3 out of 5 subjects achieved successful stop scores similar to those obtained using a manually controlled joystick .",
    "even though no subjects were able to complete the course as fast as manual control , it is encouraging that the average composite scores increased significantly over the course of the study .",
    "furthermore , the average composite scores ( table 5 ) improved over time , with the best scores approaching 100% for subjects 3 and 5 by the end of the study . therefore , not only was online control significantly different from random walk , but it was also meaningful . given this trend ,",
    "additional training and practice may help further improve performance , possibly to the point of approaching that of the manually controlled joystick . in conclusion",
    ", the high level of online control achieved by sci subjects over the course of 5 experimental days suggests that it may be feasible to apply this bci system to control a lower extremity prosthesis for ambulation after sci .",
    "furthermore , the proposed bci - vre system may serve as a training platform for operation of bci lower extremity prostheses once they become widely available .",
    "this study shows that sci subjects can purposefully operate a self - paced bci - vre system in real time , and that the current bci design approach is able to overcome the potential problems associated with variations in neurophysiology due to cortical reorganization after sci , learning and plasticity processes , and differences in kmi strategies .",
    "furthermore , the system satisfies the requirements of an ideal bci - lower extremity prosthesis set forth in  @xcite , namely : intuitiveness , robustness , and short training time .",
    "the operation of the system is intuitive as it enabled subjects to use walking kmi to control the ambulation of the avatar .",
    "the system is robust in that the data - driven decoding methodology was able to successfully accommodate for subject - to - subject and day - to - day variations in the neurophysiological underpinnings of idling and walking kmi behaviors .",
    "in addition , subjects were able to maintain purposeful online control over the course of several weeks , further underscoring the system s robustness over time .",
    "finally , the system required only a short training time , as bci control was generally attained after only a 10-min training data collection procedure followed by a 2-min calibration session on the 1@xmath6 experimental day ( for 4 out of the 5 subjects ) .",
    "the successful outcome of this study indicates that bci - controlled lower extremity prostheses for gait rehabilitation or restoration after sci may be feasible in the future .",
