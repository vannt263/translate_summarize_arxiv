    "in recent years , the characteristic polynomials of random matrices have found considerable interest .",
    "this interest was sparked , at least in part , by the discovery by keating and snaith @xcite that the moments of a random matrix from the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) seem to be related to the moments of the riemann zeta - function along the critical line . following this observation ,",
    "several authors have investigated the moments and correlation functions of the characteristic polynomial also for other random matrix ensembles ( see brzin and hikami @xcite , mehta and normand @xcite , strahov and fyodorov @xcite , baik , deift and strahov @xcite , borodin and strahov @xcite , gtze and ksters @xcite ) .",
    "one important observation is that the correlation functions of the characteristic polynomials of hermitian random matrices are related to the `` sine kernel '' @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , this holds both for the unitary - invariant ensembles ( strahov and fyodorov @xcite ) and   at  least as far as the second - order correlation function is concerned   for the hermitian wigner ensembles ( gtze and ksters @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the emergence of the sine kernel may be regarded as `` universal '' for hermitian random matrices .",
    "in contrast to that , the correlation functions of the characteristic polynomials of real symmetric random matrices lead to different results .",
    "this was first observed by brzin and hikami @xcite , who investigated the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) ( see forrester @xcite or mehta @xcite for definitions ) and came to the conclusion that the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial is related to the function @xmath1 in this case .",
    "( see below for a  more precise statement of this result . ) moreover , borodin and strahov @xcite obtained similar results for arbitrary products and ratios of characteristic polynomials of the goe .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to  generalize the above - mentioned result by brzin and hikami @xcite about the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of the goe to arbitrary real symmetric wigner matrices . throughout this paper ,",
    "we consider the following situation : let @xmath2 be a probability distribution on the real line such that @xmath3 and let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be independent families of independent real random variables with distribution @xmath2 on some probability space @xmath6 .",
    "also , let @xmath7 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "then , for any @xmath10 , the real symmetric wigner matrix of size @xmath11 is  given by @xmath12 , and the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial is  given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are real numbers and @xmath15 denotes the identity matrix of size @xmath11 .",
    "in the special case where @xmath2 is given by the standard gaussian distribution , the  distribution of the random matrix @xmath16 is the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "( note , however , that our scaling is slightly different from that mostly used in the literature ( see forrester @xcite or mehta @xcite ) , since the variance of the off - diagonal matrix entries is fixed to @xmath17 , and not to @xmath18 . ) the result by brzin and hikami @xcite then corresponds to the statement that @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "our main result is the following generalization of ( [ goe ] ) :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath2 be a probability distribution on the real line satisfying ( [ momentconditions ] ) , let @xmath23 be defined as in ( [ correlationfunction ] ) , let @xmath20 , and let @xmath21",
    ". then we  have @xmath24 where @xmath22 denotes the density of the semi - circle law , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 , by continuous extension .",
    "in particular , we find that the correlation function of the characteristic polynomial asymptotically factorizes into a universal factor involving the function @xmath28 , another universal factor involving the density @xmath29 of the semi - circle law , and which depends on the underlying distribution @xmath2 only via its fourth moment @xmath30 , or its fourth cumulant @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the above result with the corresponding result for hermitian wigner matrices ( theorem  1.1 in gtze and ksters @xcite ) , which states that under similar assumptions as in  ( [ momentconditions ] ) and with similar notation as in  ( [ correlationfunction ] ) , we have @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the analogues of @xmath23 and @xmath30 , respectively . ) obviously , the structure of ( [ hermitian ] ) and ( [ symmetric ] ) is the same .",
    "the most notable difference is given by the fact that the `` sine kernel '' @xmath0 in ( [ hermitian ] ) is replaced with the function @xmath28 in ( [ symmetric ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that both functions are closely related to bessel functions , as  already observed by brzin and hikami @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is well - known ( see p.78 in  erdlyi @xcite ) that @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the bessel function of order @xmath37 .",
    "thus , if one wishes , one may rewrite both ( [ hermitian ] ) and ( [ symmetric ] ) in the common form @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 in the hermitian case and @xmath41 , @xmath42 in the symmetric case .    furthermore , in the special case that @xmath43 , theorem [ maintheorem ] reduces to a  result about determinants of random matrices , due to zhurbenko @xcite .    to prove theorem [ maintheorem ] , we  show that the approach for hermitian wigner matrices adopted by gtze and ksters @xcite can easily be adapted to real symmetric wigner matrices .",
    "this stands in contrast to the `` orthogonal polynomial approach '' typically used in the analysis of the invariant ensembles , for which the transition from the unitary - invariant ensembles ( such as the gue ) to the orthogonal - invariant ensembles ( such as the goe ) is usually more complicated .",
    "* acknowledgement .",
    "* the author thanks friedrich gtze for the suggestion to  study the problem .",
    "in this section , we determine the exponential generating function of the correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of a real symmetric wigner matrix .",
    "our results generalize those by zhurbenko @xcite , who considered the special case of determinants .",
    "we make the following conventions : the determinant of the `` empty '' ( , @xmath44 ) matrix is taken to be @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath45 is an @xmath46 matrix and @xmath47 is a real or complex number , we set @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the @xmath46 identity matrix .",
    "also , if @xmath45 is an @xmath46 matrix and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are families of pairwise different indices from the set @xmath52 , we write @xmath53}$ ] for the @xmath54-matrix obtained from @xmath45 by removing the rows indexed by @xmath50 and the columns indexed by @xmath51 . thus , for any @xmath46 matrix @xmath55 @xmath56 , we  have @xmath57 } ) + a_{n , n } \\det(a^{[n : n ] } ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as follows by expanding the determinant about the last row and the last column .",

    "recall that we write @xmath16 for the real symmetric random matrix @xmath59 , where the @xmath60 are the random variables from the introduction .",
