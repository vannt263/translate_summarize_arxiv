    "the relation between mathematics and physics at a foundational level is a topic of much interest .",
    "the need for deeper understanding of the relation is emphasized by wigner s paper `` on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences '' @xcite this paper and others @xcite on this and similar topics @xcite suggest that this is a worthwhile area in which to work .",
    "wigner s paper was also part of the impetus for earlier work towards a coherent theory of mathematics and physics together @xcite .",
    "it is clear that numbers play an essential role in this relation between physics and mathematics .",
    "numbers provide the connection between theory and experiment .",
    "theoretical predictions of physical quantities as numbers that are outcomes of computations , are to be compared with numerical outcomes of experiments .",
    "this paper is based on the observation that numbers of different types , ( natural numbers , integers , rationals , reals , and complex numbers ) , as mathematical structures satisfying relevant axioms , have a flexibility that affects both theory descriptions of physical quantities and the comparison of theory to experiment .",
    "this flexibility is based on the separation of two concepts , that of numbers as elements of a base set of a structure , and the values the numbers have in the structure .",
    "a consequence of this concept separation is the possibility to assign different number values to each of the base set elements .",
    "this is the basis of number scaling described here and in earlier work .",
    "this distinction between number and number value is exploited here by first associating separate number structures with each location in a space or space time manifold , @xmath0 .",
    "this association allows the introduction of a space and time dependence of the number values associated with the elements of the base sets in the structures .",
    "the separation of of number from number value is based on the description of mathematical systems of a given type as structures or models .",
    "structures for each system type are required to satisfy a set of axioms relevant to the type of system @xcite .",
    "number structures with different number values for the same base set are referred to as scaled number structures or just scaled numbers .",
    "another impetus for this work comes from gauge theories .",
    "these are based on the association of separate finite dimensional vector spaces with each point of a space time manifold @xcite .",
    "gauge transformations between vector spaces at neighboring points of @xmath0 account for the freedom to choose basis sets for the spaces at different locations @xcite .",
    "just one scalar field is assumed to be the common field for all the vector spaces .    in this paper and in earlier work",
    ", this assumption is dropped in that a separate scalar field is associated with each point of @xmath0 .",
    "the scalar fields are real for tangent vector spaces on @xmath0 and complex for vector spaces used in gauge theories .",
    "the scalar field correspondent to the basis choice freedom for vector spaces in gauge theories is based on the distinction between the concepts of number and number value , and the choice freedom for values of numbers in structures at different locations of @xmath0 .",
    "the separation of the concepts of number from number value and the resulting number scaling are described in the next section .",
    "this is followed in section [ fb ] by a description of fiber bundles @xcite on a base manifold , @xmath1 fiber bundles provide a very useful setup as a description of gauge theories @xcite and as a distinction between local mathematical structures as fiber elements and global elements as fields or sections and connections on the bundle .",
    "the effects of number scaling are accounted for by use of a space and time dependent scaling field , @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of this field on gauge theories are described in sections [ c ] and [ gt ] .",
    "number scaling as defined here and in previous work @xcite , is different from other types of scaling described in the literature .",
    "it is different from conformal scaling @xcite in that all quantities , angles , as well as lengths , and other quantities are scaled .",
    "it is different from the geometric scaling introduced by weyl @xcite in that the scaling field introduced here is scalar and thus integrable .",
    "a recent paper @xcite describing the relativization of arithmetic is similar to the description given here of number scaling for the natural numbers .",
    "the effects of number scaling with fiber bundles are extended to other areas of physical theory in section [ lnm ] on local and nonlocal representations of nonlocal physical quantities .",
    "nonlocal physical quantities are those expressed as integrals or derivatives over space and/or time .",
    "local representations of these quantities are contained within a fiber as they are based on the structures in a fiber .",
    "nonlocal representations begin as integrals or derivatives over quantities in different fibers .",
    "since the integrands or derivative components belong to different fibers , connections are used to move the components to a common location .",
    "the expansion of a quantum wave packet as an integral of space components and lengths of paths on @xmath0 are used as examples .",
    "the space and time dependence of the scaling field might be expected to affect the comparison of computation and measurement results .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "this is shown in section [ cecr ] where it is noted that comparison of results requires physical transmissions of the information in the outcome states to a common location for local comparison .",
    "it is also emphasized that the scaling field interpolates or connects experiment and computation outcomes as numbers in a base set with the theoretical values as number values in a scaled number structure .",
    "the next section discusses restrictions imposed on the scaling field , @xmath2 by the fact that experiments done to date do not seem to show the presence of @xmath2 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath2 should be roughly constant over a region of cosmological space and time in which sentient beings or observers can communicate . outside this region , which is small compared to the size of the universe , there are no restrictions on @xmath3    finally , last but by no means least , this paper is dedicated to howard brandt .",
    "he encouraged this sort of work even though it did not seem to be relevant to other areas in physics or mathematics .",
    "his kind words will be missed .",
    "as noted in the introduction , mathematics is based on a collection of structures of different types .",
    "many of the structures are interconnected by maps between structures .",
    "a structure consists of a base set , a few basic operations , none , or a few basic relations and a few constants .",
    "the structure is required to satisfy a relevant set of axioms .",
    "the different structure types are connected by different maps between the structures .",
    "maps such as scalar vector multiplication and vector norms , are examples of these maps between a vector space and the underlying scalar field structure .",
    "a good way to approach number scaling is to note that structures for the different types of numbers , as usually used , conflate two different concepts : numbers as elements of the base sets , and the values that the numbers have in the structures .",
    "as will be seen , one can define many different structures for the same type of number .",
    "the structures all have the same base set , but the elements of the base set have different values that depend on the structure containing them .    natural numbers , or nonnegative integers ,",
    "provide the clearest example for the distinction between number and number value .",
    "the usual structure , @xmath4 is represented by @xmath5here @xmath6 are basic operations , @xmath7 is a basic relation , and @xmath8 are constants .",
    "this structure satisfies the axioms for a commutative semiring with identity @xcite . in this structure ,",
    "the element , @xmath9 in the base set has value , @xmath10 .",
    "in particular the base set element , @xmath11 , has value @xmath12 because it satisfies the multiplicative identity axiom .",
    "quotes are used to emphasize the fact that the base set elements , as represented here , are numbers and not number values .    here and from now on , number structures that satisfy relevant axioms",
    "are denoted by an overline , as in @xmath4 .",
    "elements , such as @xmath13 without an overline , denote base sets .",
    "the even numbers also give a valid structure for the natural numbers .",
    "the corresponding structure is defined as @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the subset of @xmath13 consisting of the elements @xmath16 the value of the number , @xmath17 , satisfies the multiplicative identity axiom in this structure . as a result it has value @xmath18 the subscript @xmath19 on @xmath12 and on other structure components identifies the structures containing the components .",
    "this is a simple example of the separation of the concept of number , as a base set element , from the value it has in a structure .",
    "it shows that the element , @xmath17 in the base set has value , @xmath20 in @xmath21 and value @xmath22 in @xmath4 . in general the base set element , @xmath23 has value @xmath10 in @xmath24 .",
    "the only element whose value is unchanged is @xmath25    a useful way to represent this is by means of value maps , for example @xmath26 denotes the value of @xmath27 in @xmath28 note that @xmath29 however @xmath30 is the value of @xmath31 in @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the same value in @xmath24 as @xmath10 is in @xmath28    another example of natural numbers is provided by von neumann s description of the natural numbers as the finite ordinals in set theory . in this representation ,",
    "the base set @xmath13 consists of the elements , @xmath34 here @xmath35 denotes the empty set .",
    "the base set @xmath15 is a subset of @xmath13 consisting of the sets , @xmath36 the set @xmath37 has value @xmath19 in @xmath4 and value @xmath20 in @xmath32    these arguments can be extended to natural number structures whose base set consists of multiples of @xmath38 this structure is represented by @xmath39 the base set , @xmath40 consists of the elements , @xmath41 the element @xmath27 in @xmath42 has value , @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath10 is even , @xmath27 has value @xmath45 in @xmath24 and value @xmath46 in @xmath28    this can all be expressed using value maps .",
    "one has @xmath47 .",
    "also @xmath48here @xmath49 is the same number value in @xmath44 as @xmath50 is in @xmath32 if @xmath51 is a number in @xmath42 then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the value of @xmath54 in @xmath55    this shows that , by themselves , the natural numbers in the base set have no intrinsic values ( @xmath56 excepted ) .",
    "numbers acquire values only as base set elements in a valid structure .",
    "these relations between @xmath24 and @xmath44 show that the components of the structure , @xmath57 can be mapped onto those of @xmath32 this map is the identity map on the base set elements in that they are unchanged .",
    "in essence this map represents the element values and components in one structure in terms of those in another structure .",
    "the action of this map converts @xmath44 to a new structure , @xmath58 in which the number values of the numbers in @xmath42 are those of @xmath24 and the basic operations and relation of @xmath44 are expressed in terms of those of @xmath32 the resultant structure is given by @xmath59    the scaling of the multiplication operation shown here is not arbitrary .",
    "it is a consequence of the requirement that the map preserves the truth of the arithmetic axioms .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that @xmath44 satisfies the axioms if and only if @xmath24 does if and only if @xmath58 does . in particular , note that the value @xmath60 satisfies the multiplicative identity axiom in @xmath58 if and only if @xmath61 satisfies the axiom in @xmath62 @xmath63    this is the essence of the basic ideas behind number scaling applied to the natural numbers .",
    "it shows that for any element , @xmath64 in @xmath40 the value assigned to @xmath64 in @xmath44 is @xmath65 times the value assigned to @xmath64 in @xmath66 if @xmath51 is a factor of @xmath67 then the value of @xmath64 in @xmath44 is @xmath68 times the value of @xmath64 in @xmath69    this description of number scaling can be easily extended to other types of numbers such as the integers , and the rational , real , and complex numbers . for any rational , real , or complex scaling factor ,",
    "@xmath70 the corresponding scaled structures for the rational , real and complex numbers are given respectively by    @xmath71    that satisfy the axioms for the smallest ordered field @xcite , @xmath72 that satisfy the axioms for a complete ordered field @xcite , and @xmath73 that satisfy axioms for an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath74 @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath2 serve to assign meaning to the numerical outcomes of computation or measurements .",

    "this takes account of the possibility that intelligent life exists outside the solar system .",
    "there are no restrictions on the gradients of @xmath188 and @xmath35 outside the local region .",
    "another relevant aspect of the presence of a scalar scaling field is that it has no effect on comparison of outcomes of computations or measurements with one another .",
    "the reason is that these outcomes are physical systems in physical states .",
    "comparison requires transmission of the information in these states to a common location for local comparison . as a consequence",
    "the fact that the scaling field may have different values at the locations of the implementation of computations or experiments is not relevant .",
    "however the scaling field does affect the values assigned to the outcomes of computations or experiments .",
    "these outcomes are numbers .",
    "values of these numbers are needed to compare with theoretical predictions as number values .",
