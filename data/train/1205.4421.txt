    "the topological description of the quantum states of matter sets in a new paradigm in the description and classification of atomic solids .",
    "namely , atomic solids whose energy band structure possess nontrivial topological properties constitute a new class of materials whose salient properties are robust to phase transitions which modify the symmetry order of the atomic solid .",
    "prominent examples of such topological atomic solids are the integer/ fractional quantum hall ( i / fqhe ) systems and the topological insulators ( tis )",
    ". well - known examples of topological properties are the existence of chiral edge states in qhe systems and the presence of gapless surface states in tis which are both immune to order - disorder phase transitions .",
    "the advent of artificial electromagnetic ( em ) structures such as photonic crystals and metamaterials has established over the years a continuous conveyance of ideas and methods from atomic solids to their em counterparts . quite naturally , the concept of topological order has been adapted to photonic crystals starting with the qhe : a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice of gyromagnetic/ gyroelectric cylinders is a system with broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite with frequency bands characterized by a nonzero chern number , allowing for the emergence of unidirectional ( one - way ) edge states @xcite in analogy with the chiral edges states in qhe systems such as a 2d electron gas or graphene nanoribbons under magnetic field .",
    "anomalous qhe can also be simulated with artificial chiral metamaterials of gyromagnetic components .",
    "@xcite in tis @xcite and quantum spin hall systems @xcite in 2d , the presence of magnetic field is not prerequisite for the appearance of topological electron states . in analogy with atomic tis , in certain 3d photonic crystals and metamaterials with proper design ,",
    "topological frequency bands appear without comprising gyromagnetic/ gyroelectric materials which require the application of external magnetic field in order to break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite    in this letter , we propose a class of 2d em networks possessing topological frequency bands without the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "namely , we show that topological bands emerge in 2d lattices of em resonators connected with left- and right - handed metamaterial elements such as transmission lines or waveguides loaded with a negative refractive - index medium .",
    "the topological nature of the corresponding frequency bands is manifested by the emergence of an exceptional point for transverse electric ( te ) and by the generation of one - way modes for transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves . in the latter case",
    ", the system can be viewed as a simulator of the fqhe for polaritons .",
