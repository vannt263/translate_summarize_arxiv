    "in quantum mechanics , objects are described by wavefunctions .",
    "these take the form of complex superpositions of various evolutionary alternatives , or states .",
    "although successful in describing many aspects of the quantum world , this picture often leads to troubling interpretations when extrapolated to the macroscopic level .",
    "one issue that has suffered long debate is the fact that one never observes a superposition of states .",
    "rather , one only observes a system s _ basic _ or _ stationary _ states .",
    "we are therefore forced to provide a mechanism by which quantum wavefunctions reduce to their stationary states .",
    "this process is called _ wavefunction collapse _ or _",
    "state reduction_. motivated by the basic conflicts which exist between general relativity and quantum mechanics , a number of authors have proposed the idea that wavefunction collapse is an objective phenomenon which arises due to gravitational effects @xcite .",
    "for example penrose @xcite has suggested a scheme in which a superposition of two stationary quantum states should be fundamentally unstable if there exists a significant mass displacement between them . in this case",
    "there should be some characteristic timescale @xmath3 for decay into the basic states .",
    "although a detailed estimate of @xmath3 would require a full theory of quantum gravity , under this hypothesis it is reasonable to expect that for non - relativistic systems @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gravitational self - energy of the difference between the mass distributions of the two states .",
    "the explicit nature of the basic states in this consideration is somewhat unclear .",
    "we can not simply regard the position of a lump of mass as a basic state , because then we would be forced to regard any general state of a particle as a superposition . as a possible solution to this problem",
    ", penrose proposes that these ( non - relativistic ) basic states are solutions of the schroedinger equation @xmath6 where the additional term represents a coupling to a certain gravitational potential @xmath7 . this potential is determined ( via the poisson equation ) by the expectation value of the mass distribution in the state determined by the wavefunction .",
    "for single particle systems , the matter density is determined by the probability density from the wavefunction , and so @xmath8 where @xmath9 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath10 is the mass of the single particle .",
    "equations ( [ e2],[e3 ] ) are dubbed the schroedinger - newton ( sn )  equations @xcite .",
    "a  preliminary investigation of the properties of the solutions to the sn equations was recently carried out by moroz et .",
    "al . @xcite . under the assumptions of spherical symmetry in @xmath11 dimensions , and by demanding only that @xmath7 and @xmath12 be everywhere smooth",
    ", they discovered a discrete family of bound state solutions , labelled by an integer @xmath13 .",
    "each solution is a normalizable wavefunction , and the @xmath14th solution has @xmath14 zeros .",
    "the energy eigenvalues associated with each of these solutions are negative , and monotonically converge to zero for large @xmath14 .",
    "these results can be justified analytically @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are the differences between a given bound state and a continuum ` superposition ' state , and so provide via  ( [ e1 ] ) an estimate of the timescale of self - collapse of a single particle of mass @xmath10 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues scale like @xmath15 , and so particles of small mass have extremely long self - collapse times  for a nucleon mass the estimate is @xmath16s @xcite . a recent related study by soni is commensurate with these results @xcite .    relaxing",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is in general a difficult task due to the non - linearity of the sn equations .",
    "however there are two situations in which this is fairly straightforward : cylindrical symmetry with no angular momentum and planar symmetry .",
    "rewriting the sn equations for these cases effectively reduces them to @xmath17 and @xmath18 dimensional situations respectively .",
    "these cases , along with the spherically symmetric case , can be simultaneously recovered by rewriting the spherically symmetric sn equations in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "motivated by the above , we consider in this paper an analysis of the @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric sn equations , for @xmath19 .",
    "although the higher - dimensional cases are of less direct physical interest that the @xmath20 cases , such a study affords us some insight into the dimensional behaviour of the sn  system .",
    "this behaviour may be of more than pure pedagogical interest since many candidate approaches to quantum gravity are typically cast in higher dimensions ( superstring theory being the obvious example ) .",
    "any solution to the sn equations ( [ e2],[e3 ] ) must be normalizable ( i.e. square - integrable ) . integrating the probability density over all space yields @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a dimensionless number , and so the wavefunction must be rescaled to ensure there is unit probability of finding the particle somewhere in space .",
    "writing  @xmath23 , the sn equations then become @xmath24 and we see that the normalization factor enters the system due to its non - linearity . redefining variables in ( [ sna],[snb ] ) via @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 yields @xmath27 where we can assume that @xmath28 is real without loss of generality .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 have units of @xmath31 and @xmath32 energy respectively .",
    "the system ( [ e6],[e7 ] ) is invariant under the rescaling transformation @xmath33 independent of the dimension @xmath0 , where @xmath34 has units of inverse length . using this transformation we can rewrite the system in terms of fully dimensionless functions @xmath35 of dimensionless variables . for the spherically symmetric case the @xmath0-dimensional laplacian operator is @xmath36 and",
    "so ( [ e6],[e7],[newnorm ] ) become @xmath37 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "we must require that the integral in ( [ normint ] ) be finite in order for the sn  system to be physically meaningful .",
    "we therefore seek solutions to the sn  system that are finite for all values of @xmath39 ; continuity requirements imply that these solutions are everywhere smooth .",
    "note that @xmath40 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "however , our equation ( [ normint ] ) clearly has a problem for @xmath41 , where we lose our ability to rescale using @xmath34 .",
    "because we still require the wavefunction to be normalized to unity , we are forced to introduce a constant @xmath42 in the @xmath41 case so that @xmath43",
    ". then our equations ( [ e8 ] ) , ( [ e9 ] ) , and ( [ normint ] ) become @xmath44 we will not always include this constant @xmath45 explicitly in the following discussion . it will simply be understood to occur in the rescaling when @xmath41 .",
    "smoothness implies that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are finite . with this information we can rewrite ( [ e8],[e9 ] ) as @xmath48",
    "it is straightforward to show that picard s theorem @xcite is satisfied by this system of equations , and so given @xmath49 and @xmath50 a unique solution to ( [ e8],[e9 ] ) exists within a range @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 versions of the integral equations ( [ e8a],[e9a ] ) require some care . integrating ( [ e8],[e9 ] ) explicitly for these cases yields @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "both of these sets of equations may be obtained formally from ( [ e8a],[e9a ] ) by inserting these values of @xmath0 , the latter case being understood as the limit @xmath57 .",
    "note that for all of these cases the function @xmath58 is montonically decreasing since @xmath59 a result valid for all @xmath60 .",
    "hence if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 and so @xmath63 will also diverge for large @xmath38 .",
    "consequently only @xmath64 is of physical interest . for @xmath65",
    "the function @xmath66  initially . by rewriting @xmath67 equation ( [ e8 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath68",
    "s=0   \\label{e11a}\\ ] ] which for @xmath69 is bessel s equation .",
    "hence near the origin we expect @xmath70 to have oscillatory behaviour .",
    "however when @xmath58 becomes negative eq .",
    "( [ e11a ] ) is similar to the modified bessel equation and the behaviour of @xmath70 will be a linear combination of exponentially amplified and damped functions .",
    "normalization requirements imply that only the exponentially damped solutions are allowed . in this case",
    "@xmath63 decays like an exponential times an inverse power of @xmath38 and so the integral in ( [ e9a ] ) will be finite , yielding a finite @xmath58 at large @xmath38 .",
    "this behaviour was already noted for the @xmath71 case @xcite ; we see here that it is valid for arbitrary @xmath72",
    "the form ( [ e8],[e9 ] ) of the sn  equations is not well - suited for numerical study .",
    "a more convenient form is @xmath73 we are interested in finding solutions to the system ( [ e11],[e12 ] ) for that are smooth and finite for all @xmath38 .",
    "these are the bound state solutions referred to earlier .",
    "we will require our initial conditions , @xmath74 and @xmath75 to be greater than zero , a constraint which avoids both the trivial solutions @xmath76  and the non - normalizable solutions @xmath77 , and is consistent with the rescaling freedom ( [ rescale ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the power - series solutions to ( [ e11],[e12 ] )  near the origin : @xmath78 where the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 and their first derivatives are required to be finite at the origin .  using the rescaling freedom to set @xmath81 ( which is equivalent to setting @xmath82 )",
    ", we see that for any dimension @xmath0 the solutions near the origin depend only on a single free parameter .",
    "integrating the system ( [ e11],[e12 ] ) using a fehlberg fourth - fifth order runge - kutta method in maple we find that in each dimension @xmath0 an infinite set of discrete bound states appears as expected .",
    "these can be identified by the number of local extrema .",
    "an infinite amount of precision is required in the choice of @xmath49 such that the solutions do not diverge as @xmath38 increases . this value of @xmath49 marks the transition between solutions in which @xmath63 diverges to @xmath83 and solutions where @xmath63 diverges to @xmath84 .",
    "as we increase the accuracy of @xmath49 for a specific bound state , the value of @xmath38 at which @xmath63 blows up increases .",
    "we will see that the values for @xmath49 and the distance between bound states vary significantly with dimension .",
    "the general method for finding solutions to the @xmath0-dimensional system is the same as that in the @xmath71 case @xcite .",
    "choose a value of @xmath85 for which @xmath63  has @xmath14 zeros and diverges to @xmath86 at finite @xmath38 .  then select a slightly smaller value of @xmath87 which has @xmath88 zeros and diverges to @xmath89 for some finite @xmath38 .  between these two values of @xmath49",

    ".  the potential @xmath58  will also be smooth and finite , with finite energy eigenvalue @xmath91 . by successively narrowing this interval the bound - state value of @xmath49",
    "can be achieved to any desired accuracy .",
    "the bound state wavefunction with @xmath88 zeros may be obtained by choosing another value @xmath92 and repeating the procedure with @xmath93 .",
    "we find that the values @xmath94 are rapidly decreasing functions of the dimension @xmath0 , and that the bound state solutions appear to accumulate at @xmath2 .",

    "figures 4 to 8 illustrate the first bound state transitions for dimensions @xmath56 to @xmath2 .",
    "figure 9 illustrates the accumulation effect at @xmath2 .",
    "we turn now to the problem of  determining the energy eigenvalues for the bound states . from ( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e9a ] ) we find that the large-@xmath99 expansion of @xmath100 is @xmath101 where @xmath102 these expansions are formally valid for all @xmath103 ; the explicit expansions for @xmath52 are @xmath104 and @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an arbitrary length scale .",
    "the energy eigenvalue is given by @xmath107 the quantity @xmath108 is the point at which the potential @xmath109 vanishes .  for @xmath110 @xmath111 .",

    "a newtonian gravitational potential diverges linearly with @xmath113 . here",
    "we extract the @xmath38-independent term from ( [ e15 ] ) to obtain @xmath114 ; the result is still given by the right - hand side of ( [ e18 ] ) with @xmath54 .",
    "effectively we have set @xmath115 in ( [ e15 ] ) even though this equation is a large @xmath99 expansion .",
    "for @xmath56 the newtonian potential diverges at both large and small @xmath116 .",
    "the normalization point @xmath117 is therefore arbitrary , and we set @xmath118 so that ( [ e18 ] ) remains valid in this case as well .",
    "this is tantamount to setting @xmath119  .",
    "a natural normalization point is to choose @xmath106 to be the point at which the potential @xmath120 .",

    "the parameter @xmath34  ( or alternatively @xmath50 )  is completely arbitrary ,  serving the sole function of setting the length scales of the problem in units of @xmath124 .  solving ( [ normint ] ) for @xmath34 yields",
    "@xmath125 with this normalization , we find that @xmath126 and so the @xmath0-dimensional energy is given in units of @xmath127 .",
    "the quantities @xmath128 and @xmath129  are straightforwardly solved numerically from ( [ e14a],[e14b ] ) .",
    "the preceding expression can be rewritten as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the planck mass in @xmath132  dimensions ( in one spatial dimension the quantity @xmath133  is unitless , and can be absorbed into the normalization constant @xmath22 ) .",
    "for @xmath134 the energy eigenvalue is an increasing function of the particle mass , whereas for @xmath135 it is a decreasing function .",
    "the most rapid increase is @xmath136 for @xmath71 , with only linear and quadratic dependence in @xmath54 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the time - scale for collapse of the state vector is therefore most rapid in a world with three spatial dimensions for any bodies whose mass is appreciably larger than the planck mass .  in a world of more than four dimensions the collapse is fastest for the lightest - mass particles , leading to behaviour which is at complete odds with that expected in the macroscopic world .",
    "if we interpret the lower - dimensional cases to be situations in three spatial dimensions with planar or cylindrical symmetry , a somewhat different picture emerges . inserting the constants into ( [ eplanck ] ) , the dependence of the energy eigenvalues for the planar , cylindrical and spherically symmetric cases are respectively @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the planck length and @xmath139 is the dimension of the box ( or cylinder ) in which the particle is confined .  from the perspective of state - vector reduction",
    ", a particle prepared in a plane - wave or cylindrical state will have a radically different time - scale of collapse than the same particle prepared in a spherically symmetric state .",
    "a neutron in a spherically symmetric state will have a collapse time of @xmath140 whereas a neutron confined to a square box @xmath141 m in cross - sectional size will have a collapse time of only @xmath142 .",
    "both of these times are much longer than the age of the universe .",
    "however by confining a neutron to a rectangular pipe whose width is on the order of 10 picometers , the collapse time becomes on the order of @xmath143 , or about 12 days .",
    "such an experiment would push the limits of current technologly .    note that for @xmath41 the probability is scale - invariant , and it is not possible to solve ( [ normint ] ) for @xmath34 .",
    "the energy scale in this dimension is independent of the wavefunction normalization .",
    "if we work through the problem using the @xmath45 rescaled equations ( [ e9d4 ] ) and ( [ normintd4 ] ) , we can recover an expression for the energy eigenvalues in this dimension using ( [ e - eigen ] ) . when rescaling equations ( [ e13 ] ) we can choose to absorb @xmath45 in the rescaling of the expansion coefficients : @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are equivalent to ( [ e14c ] ) and ( [ e14d ] ) . then solving ( [ normintd4 ] ) for @xmath45",
    "we get    @xmath147    we use this normalization to solve for the energy eigenvalue when @xmath41 @xmath148 clearly we are left with an unsolved parameter , @xmath149 , which is at this point completely arbitrary .",
    "this is a consequence of the introduction of the rescaling constant @xmath45 in the @xmath41 case .",
    "a graph of the invariant @xmath150 is instructive because it reflects the behaviour of the energy eigenvalue solutions with bound state that is independent of the value of the @xmath0-dimensional newton constant .",
    "figure 10 shows that the energy eigenvalues are positive and increase with bound state for @xmath52 , consistent with what we expect for the form of the classical newtonian gravitational potential in these dimensionalities .",
    "figure 11 shows that the energy eigenvalues are negative for dimensions greater than 3 . in this graph , the values of @xmath149 and @xmath151",
    "are set to unity for @xmath41 .",
    "we have presented the preliminary results of our numerical and analytical investigation of the schroedinger - newton equations in @xmath0 dimensions under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "consistent with previous analyses in 3 dimensions , we have demonstrated numerically the existence of a discrete set of  `` bound - state '' solutions for the equations , which are associated with different energy eigenvalues .",
    "the bound states appear to accumulate for dimensions greater than or equal to six .",
    "the bound state energies for @xmath52 are positive and increase with increasing bound state number .",
    "for @xmath152 the energies are negative and converge to zero with increasing eigenvalue number . this is consistent with moroz @xcite , who found that for @xmath71 the energy eigenvalues converge to zero as the order of the bound state increases . for higher dimensions ,",
    "the variation of the eigenvalues with bound state becomes less pronounced , as illustrated in figure 11 . for @xmath153",
    "we find that the eigenvalues accumulate , and we are unable to determine any energy differences between bound states to 10 significant digits .",
    "moroz ventured further in the three dimensional study to assign numerical estimations for timescales of collapse , using the lowest bound state solutions to determine energy eigenvalues .",
    "however the analogous calculation using general @xmath0 dimensions is not strictly correct due to possible dimensional variation in newton s constant @xmath154 which appears in ( [ e5 ] ) . we will not attempt to predict the variation of @xmath154 with dimension here , although we note that kaluza - klein theory suggests that @xmath154 is proportional to the three dimensional @xmath155 divided by the square root of the volume element of the extra space dimensions .",
    "we leave any such numerical estimates for future work",
    ".     however if we interpret the lower - dimensional cases to be systems in three spatial dimensions with either planar or cylindrical symmetry , a different picture emerges .",
    "the collapse time scale depends not only on the mass of the particle but also on the size of the box in which it is confined .  if the gravitational influence of the box can be neglected and if the gravitational field of the neutron in a plane wave state has planar symmetry , then we find that the collapse timescales differ enormously between the two situations .",
    "a free neutron under its own gravitational self - influence will experience a collapse of its wavefunction on a timescale many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe , whereas one confined to a rectangular pipe whose cross - sectional width is about 10 picometers in size will decay in about two weeks .",
    "an obvious extension of our work involves introducing external field into our version of the sn equations , in the form of a point source perturbation .",
    "this can be added to the schroedinger equation to give the perturbed system @xmath156 here @xmath157 is the mass which generates the perturbing field .",
    "this system is quite interesting in the respect that the form of the bound state solutions is drastically altered from that of the `` free field '' equations considered in this paper .",
    "a preliminary study of this system indicates that each bound state solution seems to have three regions . for small @xmath157 ,",
    "the solutions asymptotically approach those of the free field or non - perturbed case , as expected . for moderate values of @xmath157",
    ", the equations are goverened by both the free field and point source field , causing the values of @xmath49 , for which the solutions do not diverge , to alter considerably .",
    "finally , for very large @xmath157 , the solutions are goverened almost entirely by the point source perturbation , and become similar to the hydrogen atom solutions of the schroedinger equation .",
    "the effect of incresing dimension causes the `` transition '' values of @xmath157 ( which separate the different regions of the solutions ) to decrease .",
    "a full study of the point source perturbation is currently in progress .",
