    "the problem of finding a highly connected subset of vertices in a large graph arises in a number of applications across science and engineering . within social network analysis ,",

    "a highly connected subgraph corresponds to a cluster of similar data points @xcite .",
    "a closely related problem arises in the analysis of matrix data , e.g. in microarray data analysis . in this context ,",
    "researchers are often interested in a submatrix whose entries have an average value larger ( or lower ) than the rest @xcite .",
    "such an anomalous submatrix is interpreted as evidence of association between gene expression levels and phenotypes ( e.g. medical conditions ) . if we consider the graph adjacency matrix , a highly connected subset of vertices corresponds indeed to a principal submatrix with average value larger than the background .",
    "the special case of finding a completely connected subset of vertices ( a clique ) in a graph has been intensely studied within theoretical computer science .",
    "assuming p@xmath6np , the largest clique in a graph can not be found in polynomial time .",
    "even a very rough approximation to its size is hard to find @xcite . in particular , it is hard to detect the presence of a clique of size @xmath7 in a graph with @xmath8 vertices .",
    "such hardness results motivated the study of random instances .",
    "in particular , the so - called ` planted clique ' or ` hidden clique problem ' @xcite requires to find a clique of size @xmath9 that is added ( planted ) in a random graph with edge density @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , for a subset of vertices @xmath11 $ ] , all edges @xmath12 , with @xmath13 are present .",
    "all other edges are present independently with probability @xmath10 .",
    "such a clique can be found reliably by exhaustive search as soon as @xmath14 @xcite . however , despite many efforts , no algorithm is known that achieves this goal for @xmath15 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the problem of finding cliques of size @xmath16 is solvable , but possibly hard .",
    "proving that indeed it is computationally hard to find cliques in this regime is an outstanding problem in theoretical computer science .    for general polynomial algorithms ,",
    "it is known since @xcite that a clique of size @xmath17 can be found in time @xmath18 for any @xmath19 fixed .",
    "hence , if we allow any time complexity polynomial in @xmath8 , then the question is whether the planted clique can be found for @xmath20 .",
    "a more stringent computational constraint requires that the clique is found in nearly - linear time , i.e. in time of order @xmath21 .",
    "note that the number of bits required to encode an instance of the problem is of order @xmath22 , so @xmath23 is a logarithmic multiple of the time required to read an instance .",
    "dekel , gurel - gurevittch and peres @xcite developed a linear - time algorithm ( i.e. with complexity @xmath24 ) that finds the hidden clique with high probability , provided @xmath25 .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that , if @xmath26 , then there exists a message passing algorithm that finds with high probability the clique with @xmath27 operations .",
    "the same paper provided evidence that a certain class of ` local ' algorithms fails at the same threshold . among other motivations , the present paper generalizes and",
    "supports the existence of a fundamental threshold for local algorithms at least in the sparse graph setting .      in the present paper",
    ", we consider the problem of finding a highly connected subset of vertices in a _ sparse graph _ , i.e. in a graph with _ bounded average degree_. in this case , the hidden set size must scale linearly with @xmath8 to obtain a non - trivial behavior . somewhat surprisingly , we find that the phase transition ` at @xmath28 ' leaves a trace also in the sparse regime .",
    "more precisely , we consider a random graph generated as follows .",
    "we select a subset of vertices @xmath29 of size @xmath30 , uniformly at random given its size .",
    "we connect any two vertices in the set independently with probability @xmath31 .",
    "any other edge is added independently with probability @xmath32 , @xmath33 . the problem distribution is therefore parametrized by @xmath34 and we will be therefore interested in the limit @xmath35 , with @xmath36 fixed .",
    "a more intuitive parametrization is obtained by replacing @xmath37 with the average degrees for vertices @xmath38 , and @xmath39 denoted , respectively , by @xmath4 , @xmath5    our main rigorous result is a sharp phase transition in the following double asymptotics :    * first @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to considering large graphs .",
    "* then @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to focusing on small hidden sets , but still linear in @xmath8 .",
    "the requirement @xmath41 is a necessary consequence of @xmath40 : it can be shown that otherwise the hidden set can not possibly be detected .",
    "our main rigorous result ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) establishes that , in the above double asymptotics , a phase transition takes place for local algorithms at @xmath42 namely , we consider the problem of testing whether a vertex @xmath43 is in @xmath29 or not .",
    "we say that such a test is reliable if , in the above limit , the fraction of incorrectly estimated vertices vanishes in expectation .",
    "then :    * for @xmath44 , a local algorithm can estimate reliably @xmath29 in time of the order of the number of edges .",
    "this is achieved for instance , by the belief propagation algorithm . * for @xmath45 , no local algorithm can reliably reconstruct @xmath29 .",
    "analogously to the classical hidden clique problem , there is a large gap between what can be achieved by local algorithms , and optimal estimation with unbounded computational resources .",
    "proposition [ propo : exhaustive ] estabilishes that exhaustive search will find @xmath29 in exponential time , as soon as @xmath46 for some positive @xmath47 ( in the same double limit ) .    note that , in both cases , a small fraction of the vertices in @xmath29 remains undetected because of the graph sparsity , for any @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , the number of vertices of degree @xmath49 is linear in @xmath8 , and such nodes can not be identified .",
    "let us finally mention the degree of a vertex @xmath43 is a poisson with mean @xmath4 if @xmath38 and mean @xmath5 if @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the degree standard deviation ( outside @xmath29 ) is @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath51 is the difference in mean degree divided by the standard deviation , and has the natural interpretation of a ` signal - to - noise ratio . '",
    "while our rigorous analysis focuses on the limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( after @xmath35 ) , we will use the cavity method from spin glass theory to investigate the model behavior for _ arbitrary _ @xmath52 ( in the @xmath35 limit ) or , equivalently , arbitrary @xmath36 .",
    "we will use two approaches to obtain concrete predictions from the cavity method :    * for general @xmath37 ( bounded degree ) , we derive the cavity predictions for local quantities , as well as for the free energy density .",
    "we show that this indeed coincide ( up to a shift ) with the mutual information per variable between the hidden set @xmath29 and the observed graph @xmath53 .",
    "+ we use the ` population dynamics ' ( or ` sampled density evolution ' ) algorithm @xcite to solve numerically the cavity equations . *",
    "we then consider the limit of large @xmath37 ( large degree ) for arbitrary @xmath54 . in order to obtain a non - trivial limit ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath55 $ ] is kept fixed in this limit , together with @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "+ the cavity equations simplify in this limit ( the cavity field distributions become gaussian ) , and we can derive an exact phase diagram , without recourse to intensive numerical methods , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : phasediaglargedeg ] .",
    "this two approaches are complementary in that the large - degree asymptotics yields closed - form expressions",
    ". the qualitative features of the resulting phase diagram should remain unchanged at moderately small values of @xmath37 .",
    "our population dynamics analysis confirms this .",
    "as already mentioned , one of the motivations for the present work was to better understand the computational phase transition discovered in @xcite for the classical hidden clique problem . for background edge density @xmath10 , this takes place when the size of the hidden clique is @xmath57 .",
    "this phase transition can indeed be formally recovered as a dense limit of the results presented in this paper .",
    "more precisely , the phase transition for hidden cliques @xcite is captured by eq .",
    "( [ eq : basiccondition ] ) , once we rewrite the latter in terms @xmath58 , the variance of the degrees of nodes @xmath39 . in the sparse regime ,",
    "the degree is approximately poisson distributed , and hence @xmath59 .",
    "therefore eq .  ( [ eq : basiccondition ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath60 for the classical ( dense ) hidden clique problem , we have @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and hence we recover the condition @xmath64 .    from a different perspective ,",
    "the present work offers a statistical mechanics interpretation of the phase transitions in the hidden clique problem .",
    "namely , the latter can be formally recovered as the @xmath40 limit of the phase diagram in figure [ fig : phasediaglargedeg ] below .",
    "in particular , the computational phase transition at @xmath65 corresponds to a dynamical phase transition ( a spinodal point ) in the underlying statistical mechanics model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define formally our model and some related notations .",
    "section [ sec : cavity ] derives the phase diagram using the cavity method .",
    "in particular , we show that the model undergoes two phase transitions as the signal - to - noise ratio increases ( for @xmath66 small enough ) : a static phase transition and a dynamic one , the two phase transitions are well separated .",
    "section [ sec : rigorous ] presents rigorous bounds on the behavior of local algorithms and exhaustive search , that match the above phase transitions for small @xmath66 .",

    "proofs are deferred to the appendix .",
