    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely accepted as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction .",
    "lattice qcd methods have recently been used to study low - energy hadronic interactions , including the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interaction @xcite",
    ". however , qcd - inspired quark models are still the main tool for detailed studies of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the phenomenological quark model most commonly used in the study of @xmath2 interaction is the nonrelativistic chiral quark model ( chqm ) @xcite .",
    "nonrelativistic kinematics makes the many - body treatment of the multiquark system manageable , with the very convenient choice that the light quark mass @xmath14 is just one third of the nucleon mass . with quarks ,",
    "one needs a confinement potential to reproduce a distinctive qcd property , and a one gluon exchange ( oge ) to account for @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 mass difference and other details of baryon excitations .",
    "the inclusion of pion exchange will take care of long - range baryon - baryon interactions as well as some features in baryon structure , and is the consequence of the relative weakness of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , scalar exchange is used to describe an extra intermediate - range attraction needed in nuclear forces .",
    "no other meson exchanges are included .",
    "chqms with a few chosen and a few adjusted parameters are able to give a surprisingly simple if only semi - quantitative picture of both baryon spectra and baryon - baryon interactions at relatively low energies .",
    "it is therefore of some interest to understand some of the limitations of these simple quarks models .",
    "the most problematic term in the chqm is the scalar exchange term .",
    "it takes into account neglected channels containing @xmath15s and pions , and should therefore vary when more of these channels are explicitly included in the coupled - channel calculation .",
    "its effects always include the exchange of two pions , and are called correlated if the two pions also interact with each other .",
    "modern treatments of correlated two - pion exchange show that in addition to a long - range scalar - isoscalar attraction traditionally associated with scalar exchange , there is also a strong scalar - isoscalar repulsive core @xcite , a complication that has not yet been included in the chqm .    in the quark model ,",
    "the forces between baryonic clusters of quarks and antiquarks are like molecular forces between molecules of atoms built up from the forces between their constituents .",
    "this molecular model of nuclear forces has been extensively developed by using the quark delocalization and color screening model ( qdcsm ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "quarks confined in one baryon are allowed to delocalize to a nearby baryon and to change the dynamics of the baryon - baryon interaction through a reduction of the confinement potential called color screening .",
    "the delocalization parameter that appears is determined by the dynamics of the interacting quark system , thus making it possible for the quark system to reach a more favorable configuration through its own dynamics in a larger hilbert space .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to @xmath2 and hyperon - nucleon scatterings .",
    "the important intermediate - range @xmath2 attraction is achieved in this model by the mutual distortion of the interacting nucleons , in a way that is very similar to the mutual distortion of interacting molecules .",
    "the main difference between the chqm and the qdcsm is the mechanism for intermediate - range attraction .",
    "recently , we showed that both the chqm containing the @xmath18-meson and the qdcsm without it gave a good description of the low - energy @xmath2 @xmath3- and @xmath19-wave scattering phase shifts and the properties of deuteron with almost the same quark - model parameters @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath18-meson exchange can effectively be replaced by the quark delocalization and color screening mechanism .",
    "it is not clear however if their equivalence persists to higher energies where nucleons overlap more strongly and baryon excitation and multiquark effects become more important .",
    "interest in multiquark system has persisted since r. jaffe predicted the h - particle in 1977 @xcite .",
    "all quark models , including those using lattice qcd techniques , predict that in addition to the @xmath20 mesons and @xmath21 baryons , there should be multiquark systems @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , quark gluon hybrids @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and glueballs @xcite . up to",
    "now there has been no well established experimental candidate of these multiquark states @xcite .",
    "recently , the celsius - wasa collaboration has reported preliminary results on the abc anomaly in the production cross section of the @xmath8@xmath27@xmath28 reaction that suggests the presence of an isoscalar @xmath29 or @xmath30 subthreshold @xmath0 resonance , with resonance mass estimated at @xmath31 mev and a width of @xmath32 mev @xcite .",
    "the relatively large binding energy involved gives an object that is much closer to these interesting multiquark states than a loosely bound system like the deuteron .",
    "nonrelativistic quark models such as chqms and qdcsms fitting both @xmath33 masses and low - energy @xmath2 scattering properties can be expected to give particularly interesting and parameter - free predictions for such dibaryon multiquark states .",
    "it thus appears worthwhile to extend our past calculation of @xmath2 phase shifts to the resonance region near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 thresholds by including these excited dibaryon channels in coupled - channel calculations .",
    "the @xmath15 resonance is by far the most important low - energy baryon resonance .",
    "it dominates even the @xmath34 cross sections where its production is hindered relative to the production of isospin 1/2 @xmath35 resonances by a factor of 2 from isospin coupling . in dibaryon channels , the @xmath0 threshold at 2460 mev",
    "is clearly separated from the @xmath36 threshold at 2380 mev , the second most interesting dibaryon threshold in this energy region .",
    "@xmath0 bound states are of immediate interest in understanding resonance phenomena in this near subthreshold energy region",
    ". the inclusion of @xmath37 would be of considerable interest in a broader study of dibaryon resonances , but its inclusion is technically difficult for us because @xmath37 is commonly understood to be a monopole excitation of the nucleon that has a much more complicated quark wave function .",
    "in contrast , our approximate description of the @xmath38 excitation as a simple spin - isospin excitation without any change in the radial wave function probably captures the essence of the physics involved .",
    "@xmath15 excitations are thus within easy reach of the technology used in our previous coupled - channel calculations .",
    "our first study in the resonance region will include only @xmath15 excitations .",
    "this limitation of excited baryon degrees of freedom to @xmath15s only has often been made in past studies of nuclear forces .",
    "@xcite    we shall use the same salamanca chqm @xcite and qdcsm used previously for @xmath2 channels only @xcite with additional sets of potential parameters to find out if their similarity persists into the resonance region .",
    "we are interested in particular in discovering how similar these simple quark models are in describing theoretical dibaryon resonances originating from @xmath0 or @xmath1 bound states when the @xmath15s are treated as stable particles . in other words , these dibaryon resonances are theoretical compound dibaryon states that are allowed to decay only via the @xmath2 channels . a brief description of these two quark models of the baryon - baryon interaction is given in section ii .",
    "the @xmath2 phase shifts for these quark - quark potentials are calculated using a coupled - channel resonating group formalism @xcite that includes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and sometimes hidden - color channels as well .",
    "no explicit pionic channels are included as the @xmath15s are treated as stable particles . in this context",
    ", a promising dibaryon resonance is taken to be one arising from a bound state below the @xmath0 or @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the calculated results , including resonance masses and widths ( fwhms ) , are given in section iii in those partial waves ( pws ) where a theoretical dibaryon resonance appears in at least one quark model .",
    "no @xmath1 bound state is found in any isovector odd - parity state in all our quark models .    in sect .",
    "iv , these results are compared to partial - wave analyses of @xmath2 scattering amplitudes @xcite , where the presence of a dibaryon resonance causes a rapid counterclockwise motion in the argand diagram .",
    "the possibility that the abc effect in the @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 reaction is an isoscalar @xmath2 resonance is also discussed .",
    "section v contains brief concluding remarks on what we have learned about quark dynamics in the @xmath2 resonance region .",
    "the salamanca chqm is representative of chiral quark models .",
    "it has also been used to describe both hadron spectroscopy and nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the model details can be found in @xcite . only the hamiltonian and parameters are given here .",
    "the chqm hamiltonian in the baryon - baryon sector is      here @xmath40 is quark tensor operator , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are standard yukawa functions @xcite , @xmath44 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass , @xmath45 is the chiral coupling constant , determined as usual from the @xmath46-nucleon coupling constant .",
    "an additional @xmath47 meson exchange potential @xmath48 between quarks has been added to give an improved treatment of baryon - baryon @xmath13-states .",

    "two of the parameters ( @xmath49 ) are fitted to @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 mass difference ( @xmath50mev ) and the equilibrium condition for the nucleon mass at the chosen @xmath4 .",
    "the absolute nucleon mass is controlled by a constant term @xmath51 in the confinement potential that does not affect the baryon - baryon interaction . in chqm2 @xcite ,",
    "the deuteron binding energy ( 2.22 mev ) is fitted by varying the combination @xmath52 calculated with the standard two @xmath2 coupled channels @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( called 2nncc in the following ) . the remaining parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are fixed at chosen values .",

    "two rough fits to different data are shown in table  [ tab : abc ] .",
    "the recent preliminary wasa07 results @xcite agree roughly with the older heidelberg - tel - aviv data ( h - ta73 ) @xcite .",
    "information can also be deduced from @xmath2 scattering . for comparison ,",
    "the table gives the pw total and inelastic ( or reaction ) cross sections from the latest energy - dependent solution sp07 @xcite .",
    "we must next estimate the fraction of @xmath73 that goes through the @xmath10 channel .",
    "the estimate is made by using the following two assumptions : ( 1 ) the single - pion production cross section in either @xmath74 state is certainly not zero because a pion can be produced with the dibaryon left in isovector states . however , in order to maximize our estimate for @xmath72 , we shall ignore the contributions of all one - pion decay branches .",
    "( 2 ) the experimental cross section @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is known to be 0.270 ( 0.55 ) mb at @xmath77mev , and 0.33 ( 4.05 ) mb at @xmath78mev @xcite .",
    "these points straddle the 2410 mev abc peak of wasa07 @xcite .",
    "both cross sections should increase significantly as one approaches the abc peak from below . above the abc peak , the larger dibaryon breakup cross section probably reflects an increase in phase space , including the number of other contributing states .",
    "we now assume that both cross sections at and below the the abc peak are dominated by the same resonance in one of the two @xmath74 states in the table . using the ratio @xmath79 of these cross sections at @xmath80mev for the entire resonance",
    ", we therefore assume that @xmath81 to get the rough and perhaps generous estimates shown in the table .",
    "finally the estimated width for the two @xmath0 states is that of eq.([gammainel ] ) which includes the reduction in phase space for bound @xmath15s .",
    "table [ tab : abc ] suggests that it is relatively unlikely that the abc effect originates from a dibaryon resonance in the @xmath82 channel .",
    "the main reason is that the @xmath2 scattering described by sp07 is highly elastic so that @xmath72 is far too small .",
    "the situation for the @xmath7 channel is more promising but not without difficulty unless the preliminary wasa07 estimate of @xmath72 is reduced .",
    "additional information can be obtained from the energy dependence of the sp07 @xmath7 scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "they are non - resonant at the qdcsm3 resonance mass of 2270 mev , but they are too uncertain at the abc peak at 2410 mev to settle the question of an @xmath2 resonance there .",
    "the resonance widths are also of interest , especially for the exclusive reaction that excludes contributions from three and more pions on the high - energy side of the possible resonance .",
    "the theoretical calculation of bar - nir , risser and schuster @xcite is based on a one - pion exchange excitation to two @xmath15s followed by a pion emission from each @xmath15 .",
    "their calculated resonance width is close to free - space value @xmath83mev used in their calculation .",
    "our estimated decay width shown in table  [ tab : abc ] is much smaller but not as small as the preliminary wasa07 value . as for the branching ratio @xmath84",
    "given in table  [ tab : resonancesummary ] , the calculated value for our quark models seems too small , but the experimental value from sp07 at 2400 mev is not necessarily reliable .    in his study of the abc effect , alvarez - ruso @xcite has pointed out that the @xmath0 contribution is greatly reduced when short range repulsive correlations are included in the @xmath2 channels",
    ". then the cross section at @xmath85mev , some distance below the abc peak , is found to be dominated by the @xmath36 , with both pions emitted by the decaying roper resonance .",
    "however , at this lower energy region , the sp07 @xmath86 argand phase motion is not resonant .",
    "short range correlations are already included in the quark models used here .",
    "they are not the short - range repulsion from the exchange of vector mesons ( specifically the isoscalar @xmath87 meson ) , which would reduce if not eliminate the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "our short range correlations come from pauli antisymmetrization and channel coupling effects generated by overlapping clusters of quarks , including baryon excitations and hidden - color configurations that enhance rather than reduce these short - distance phenomena .",
    "the relative importance of these explicit quark effects found in our studies also comes from the use of large baryon clusters of quarks in all the quark models used here .",
    "the situation could be different if the baryon `` bags '' are small @xcite and the meson clouds around them are thicker .",
    "our calculated results for the dibaryon spectrum is sensitive to the model nucleon size used in the qdcsm , but not in the chqm .",
    "the baryon spectrum on the other hand is quite sensitive to the model nucleon size , especially in the radial excitations .",
    "past calculations in the chqm @xcite favors the choice near @xmath6fm . with this choice , the theoretical @xmath7 resonance arising from the @xmath88 bound state appears at about 2390 mev in chqm with quadratic confinement , probably at 2420 mev with linear confinement , and at 2360 mev for the qdcsm .",
    "experimental @xmath89 form factors at large momentum transfers that show the premature dominance of six - quark effects seem to favor the kind of quark models studied here over the more traditional short - range @xmath2 repulsive correlation @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of a @xmath90 resonance would be a dramatic demonstration of quark effects in the resonance region .",
    "its experimental non confirmation on the other hand would point to a missing short - range repulsion in our quark models , a repulsion that is usually attributed to vector meson exchanges in traditional meson exchange models of nuclear forces .",
    "we have studied resonances in @xmath2 scattering in a theoretical treatment of two baryon clusters of quarks interacting by pauli antisymmetrization and by gluon and pion exchanges .",
    "the nucleons can resonate by changing into @xmath15s , but only if the resulting baryons attract each other with sufficient strength to stay below its @xmath3-wave breakup threshold . the absence of @xmath2 @xmath3-wave resonances in the sp07 partial - wave amplitudes places an approximate upper bound of @xmath91fm on the nucleon size in the qdcs quark model .",
    "this restriction in turn requires that the @xmath7@xmath92@xmath88 resonance mass should exceed @xmath93mev . in chqms",
    ", the @xmath2 system does not resonate in relative-@xmath3 waves , but it has a @xmath94 resonance at 2390 - 2420 mev .",
    "this @xmath94 resonance is thus a promising candidate for the explanation of the abc structure at 2410 mev in the production cross section of the reaction @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "the most promising isovector @xmath2 resonance candidate in our quark models appears in the @xmath12 state and comes from a bound or almost bound @xmath11 state .",
    "none of the quark models used has bound @xmath1 @xmath13-states that might generate odd - parity isovector resonances .",
    "it is satisfying that these simple quark models containing only a few adjustable parameters fitting the @xmath33 masses and the deuteron binding energy can yield physically interesting information about the possibility of dibaryon resonances at the much higher energies near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 thresholds of @xmath2 scattering .",
    "their success is partly due to the fact a good part of the available collision energy in the center of mass frame has been used to excite the nucleons into one or two @xmath15s whose mass is fitted by the models .",
    "the system is thus effectively at much lower energies in these @xmath15 channels .",
    "the success is also derived from the ability of these simple models to capture some essential features of the baryon - baryon interactions in different energy regimes in the many channels involved in the calculation .",
    "the quark models used have many shortcomings . in the context of nonrelativistic models alone , a quantitative fit to @xmath2 phase shifts appears difficult without the fine tuning provided by the addition of the many meson exchange terms that appear in conventional boson - exchange potentials  @xcite .",
    "the need to use both quarks and meson exchanges suggests that the resonance region of interest in this paper is a transition region between the traditional low - energy regime of baryons interacting via meson exchanges and the high - energy regime of quarks interacting by quantum chromodynamics .    from a more technical perspective",
    ", our theoretical description can be improved by treating the @xmath15s as decaying particles .",
    "it would be difficult to go beyond this improvement because explicit pion channels contain three or four bodies . in our discussion of the abc effect , it is of considerable interest to improve upon our very rough estimate of the partial - wave @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 production cross sections from @xmath2 partial - wave amplitudes . in spite of these limitations ,",
    "it is clear that additional experimental knowledge and theoretical studies of @xmath2 properties in the @xmath2 resonance region near the @xmath1 and @xmath0 thresholds will add significantly to our understanding of quark dynamics between baryons .",
    "finally we should add that the final report of the celsius - wasa collaboration on the abc effect has now appeared  @xcite .",
    "the structure in the total cross section for the @xmath95 reaction centers at 2.39 gev with a width of 90 mev .",
