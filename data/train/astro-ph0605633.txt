    "the lithium observed in low metallicity environments such as the atmospheres of halo stars offers a unique probe into two very distinct mechanisms of nucleosynthesis : the big bang and cosmic rays .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) produces predominantly li while cosmic ray nucleosynthesis ( crn ) produces roughly equal numbers of the li and li isotopes .",
    "the standard lore tells us that the bulk of the pop  ii li abundance is produced by bbn with additional contributions at the 10% level being supplied by galactic crn ( or gcrn ) .",
    "bbn lays down the primordial abundance which dominates the spite plateau @xcite while gcrn supplies a metallicity dependent supplement which would result in a small slope in li vs. fe regressions @xcite .",
    "li on the other hand , produced only in gcrn would be expected to show a strong ( log - linear ) relation with fe , with an abundance which is a fraction of the li abundance .",
    "indeed the first observations of li at [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xcite were at the expected level of li / li @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this simple picture has been shaken by recent observations leading to two distinct li problems .",
    "wmap @xcite has determined the baryon density of the universe to high accuracy , @xmath5 , corresponding to a baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath6 . at this value of @xmath7 , the bbn predicted value of li is li / h = @xmath8 @xcite , li / h = @xmath9 @xcite , or li / h = @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these values are all significantly larger than most determinations of the li abundance in pop ii stars which are in the range @xmath11 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and even larger than a recent determination by @xcite based on a higher temperature scale .",
    "the second li problem originates from recent observations of li @xcite which indicate a value of [ li ] @xmath12 which is _ independent _ of metallicity in sharp contrast to what is expected from gcrn models . in effect",
    ", we are faced with explaining a li plateau at a level of about 1000 times that expected from bbn @xcite . here , we will concentrate on the latter of the two li problems .",
    "different scenarios have been discussed to explain the abundance of li  in metal - poor halo stars ( mphs ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of cosmic rays produced in shocks during the formation of the galaxy , which was consistent with li  data available at that time .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite consider the decay of relic particles , during the epoch of the big bang nucleosynthesis , that can yield to a large primordial abundance of li .",
    "@xcite have studied in detail the lithium production in connection to gamma rays , using a formalism similar to ours .    previously , we computed the evolution of the li abundance produced by an initial burst of cosmological cosmic rays ( ccrs ) @xcite[hereafter rvoi ] .",
    "we found that the pregalactic production of the li isotope can account for the li plateau observed in metal poor halo stars without additional over - production of li .",
    "the derived relation between the amplitude of the ccr energy spectra and the redshift of the initial ccr production put constraints on the physics and history of the objects , such as pop iii stars , responsible for these early cosmic rays . due to the subsequent evolution of li  in the galaxy through gcrn",
    ", we argued that halo stars with metallicities between [ fe / h ] = -2 and -1 , must be somewhat depleted in li .",
    "here , we will employ detailed models of cosmic chemical evolution to derive the total ccr energy as a function of redshift .",
    "in particular , we will make use of models discussed in @xcite which were constructed to account for the observed star formation rate ( up to @xmath13 ) , the observed sn rates ( up to @xmath14 ) , early reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( at @xmath15 ) , and reasonable chemical abundances in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and igm of proto - galaxies .",
    "these models allow us to determine the total energy injected in cosmic rays as a function of redshift .",
    "once a spectral shape for the source function is given , we must account for the propagation of ccrs .",
    "furthermore , we must distinguish between diffusion in the ism and propagation in an expanding igm .",
    "we first consider the resulting nucleosynthesis if most of the high energy particles are ejected from the minihalos where star formation begins and escape into the igm .",
    "this will lead to a physical picture similar to the assumptions made in rvoi . in this context",
    ", we will see that cosmic - ray heating of the igm may place important constraints on the scenario .",
    "depending on the fraction of sn energy deposited in crs and the efficiency of shock acceleration of crs leading to their escape from structures , it may be necessary to consider in addition to the igm production of li , the in situ production when crs are confined to structures .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we will briefly describe the cosmic chemical evolution models of @xcite . in section 3 , we describe the general features of cosmological cosmic rays related to the production of lithium in the igm",
    ". there we also present our detailed calculations of the li abundance based on the pop iii production of ccrs in the igm , at high redshift . in section 4",
    ", we comment on the in situ production of li in pop iii minihalos .",
    "we summarize the status of the ccr origin of li in section 5 .",
    "the cosmic star formation histories considered are based on the detailed models of chemical evolution derived in @xcite .",
    "the models are described by a bimodal birthrate function of the form b(m , t , z ) = _ 1(m)_1(t ) + _ 2(m)_2(z ) where @xmath16 is the initial mass function ( imf ) of the normal ( massive ) component of star formation and @xmath17 is the respective star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the metallicity .",
    "the normal mode contains stars with mass between 0.1 m@xmath19 and 100 m@xmath19 and has a sfr which peaks at @xmath20 .",

    ", we restrict our attention to the best fit hierarchical model in @xcite in which the minimum mass for star formation is @xmath23 m@xmath24 . the distribution of structure masses is based on the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "the normal mode sfr is given by _",
    "1(t ) = _ 1 m_struct  , where @xmath25 is the mass of the structure ( which includes dark matter ) , @xmath26 gyr is a characteristic timescale and @xmath27 gyr@xmath28 governs the efficiency of the star formation .",
    "in contrast , the massive mode sfr is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of the baryonic gas in the structure , with @xmath31 maximized to achieve early reionization without the overproduction of metals or the over - consumption of gas .",
    "we adopt @xmath32 .",
    "we also restrict our attention to model 1 of @xcite to describe the massive mode . in model 1 , the imf is defined for stars with masses , 40 m@xmath33 m@xmath19 .",
    "all of these stars die in core collapse supernovae leaving a black hole remnant . the coefficient of star formation",

    "star formation begins at very high redshift ( @xmath35 ) but peaks at a redshift @xmath36 .",
    "note that the absolute value of the sfr depends not only on @xmath34 , but also on the efficiency of outflow .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "we also consider an example of a model ( with an imf as in model 1 ) in which the massive mode occurs as a rapid burst at @xmath37 designated as model 1e .",
    "thus , most pop iii sn occur within a very short period of time at this redshift .",
    "this model is therefore similar to the sfr assumed in rvoi . in figure",

    "two very massive mode models were considered in addition to model 1 described above . in model 2a ,",
    "the massive mode consists of stars with masses in the range 140 - 260 m@xmath24 , and in model 2b , the range used was 270 - 500 m@xmath24 . in model 2b , there is significant metal enrichment @xcite which results in a diminished sfr and hence fewer cosmic rays available for li production . in model 2b",
    ", one expects total collapse and little or no production of cosmic rays .",

    "both models have the same metallicity as a function of redshift below @xmath59 in the ism .",
    "in rvoi , we considered a single burst of crs whose total energy was fixed in an ad hoc way so as to reproduce the observed li  abundance .",
    "we now relate the production of crs to the detailed model of cosmic chemical evolution in which the sn history is completely determined by the sfr and imf of the model and are constrained to reionize the igm at a redshift @xmath60 , match the observed sfr at @xmath61 , as well as chemical abundances at @xmath62 . as a consequence , the energy density in cosmic rays is determined by the model and we can derive the abundance of lithium produced in the igm as described below .        the total kinetic energy given initially to crs by sn is @xmath63 where it is understood that the appropriate imf is used for computing cr energy density due to pop  ii or pop  iii sn .",

    "however , velocities in ism gas are of the order of a few 100 km / s while crs are mostly relativistic .",
    "thus , the cr ejection processes considered here should be independent of the overall outflow of gas and heavy elements .",

    "the large temperatures produced in the igm , prohibit the homogenous production of li ( if @xmath129 mev ) . if one considers that the li production processes occur in the whim , the constraint on the temperature are very much relaxed .",
    "indeed , this medium is denser , located around the galaxies or in filaments of clusters of galaxies .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have long since shown that the whim , heated by shock waves during structure formation , displays two different phases : a cold phase , at t@xmath157 k and a hot phase , at t@xmath158k .",
    "the cold one is observed through the absorption lines whose width distribution constrains the temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". the hot one may be responsible for the soft x - ray background , observed by _",
    "chandra _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its temperature can be constrained by the observation of broad lines ( e.g. with fuse , * ? ? ? * ) or of lines with _",
    "@xcite and , in the future , with xeus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently , the temperatures derived in our scenario , when taken in the context of the whim , are acceptable .",
    "in addition , in a dense region , other processes , such as h2 line cooling , could lower the temperature even more .",
    "note that in @xcite hydrodynamical simulations indicate that a substantial fraction of baryons in the universe remains in a diffuse component whim .",
    "this component is predicted to be at t@xmath158k , as noted previously .",
    "finally , one should bare in mind that we set @xmath85 equal to a constant value ( 1.0 ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath85 depends on the strength of the magnetic field at each epoch , on the density of the ism etc ... it is difficult to accurately estimate the escape fraction , which is certainly dependent on the energy of the particles ( roughly modeled here by @xmath84 ) . @xcite",
    "have begun an investigation into the propagation of crs in the ism taking into account all physical components . to date , they are only able to obtain the mean values of the physical parameters , but this is certainly a path to follow .",
    "note that if the efficiency is much less than one , the induced igm temperature is reduced , as is the initial enrichment of li .",
    "this will be partially offset because the density in the whim is larger than the mean density of the universe ( used in the above formalism ) , and it is quite plausible that crs are trapped there and increase the initial enrichment of lithium .",
    "the model discussed in the previous section was a homogeneous model in which the igm flux of ccrs was controlled by the sn history and in particular , our choices of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and as discussed above , @xmath85 .",
    "if cr propagation into the whim is efficient , i.e. @xmath159 , their interaction with the medium will produce the required amount of lithium as a pie , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "in fact , we expect cr propagation to be limited by diffusion , particularly at lower redshift so that they are concentrated in or near the structures leading to not only enhanced li production but also heating of the eventual intra - cluster medium as well as the warm - hot igm . in this section",
    ", we will outline the computation of li  production in the structures of the hierarchical formation scenario that end with our galaxy .",
    "we assume that the cr energy output of sn is constant over a sufficiently long time so that we can work in the context of a leaky box model .",
    "we can then adopt the physical formalism developed for libeb production in our galaxy @xcite , hereafter mar , @xcite .    in gcrn , it is common to normalize the flux of crs by reproducing the observed abundance of beryllium at present .",
    "in contrast , here , we rely on the same cosmological models described above when we consider the cosmological evolution of cr and the li abundance .",
    "in addition , we must take into account the evolution with redshift of several physical parameters defined below .",
    "finally , the production of lithium in the igm as described in the previous section acted as an effective prompt initial enrichment of li in the igm which by subsequent accretion and growth of structure led to the li  plateau observed in our galaxy . in the case of ism production ,",
    "each structure along the hierarchical tree inherits the medium as modified by sn that explode in the past .",
    "this explains the relation between metallicity and redshift seen in .",
    "thus , when we observe lithium in a star at a given metallicity , we must use the lithium abundance present when this same metallicity was reached .      as before we compute the total rate of energy density put into crs from sn , @xmath160 , using eq .",
    "[ crenergy ] .",
    "we use the same source term , @xmath76 , defined in eq .",
    "[ source ] . in the framework of a diffusion model in a medium of density @xmath161 , it is useful to consider the scaled source @xmath162 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath117 is related to the energy density inside the structures .",
    "however , @xmath160 corresponds to the energy density provided by sn _ if it was uniformly distributed within the universe _ , which was true when considering the diffusion into the igm previously .",
    "since this energy is now confined within the structure , the density there must be larger by a factor @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the average baryon energy density in the universe and @xmath165 is the fraction of baryons found in structures .",
    "therefore source function is normalized using @xmath166 note that all parameters that vary with redshift are given with the hierarchical model provided by @xcite .    by interaction with the particles present inside the medium ,",
    "cr particles lose their energy .",
    "the rate of energy lost is noted @xmath94 .",
    "we update the relations in mar using @xcite . note that this rate depends on the ionization fraction of the medium , @xmath167 .",
    "we use here @xmath168 but we checked that one could go up to @xmath169 without modifying our results .",
    "it is also convenient to define the quantity @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the velocity of the cr particle . because of the physical properties of the medium and the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", crs will be confined to some characteristic escape length , @xmath172 which in gcrn may range from 10 - 1000 g. under these condition , the solution of the diffusion equation ( mar ) for the flux @xmath173 is @xmath174 the term @xmath175 ( evaluated appropriately in the ism ) is the source of @xmath101 particles ; and @xmath176 is the ionization range which characterizes the average amount of material that an @xmath101 particle with energy @xmath102 can travel before ionization losses will stop it .",
    "@xmath177 is a function that corresponds to the diffusion solution .",
    "the rate of lithium production of lithium is then @xmath178 \\int \\sigma\\ , \\phi_\\alpha(e , z)\\ , \\d{e}\\\\                                                     & = & \\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{\\rm h}\\right ] k_{\\alpha p } \\frac{{\\cal e_{\\rm sn}}(z)}{f_b(z)\\,\\rho_c\\,\\omega_b } f(\\lambda , x_e,\\gamma , z ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] thus , if the physical properties of the structures ( @xmath179 ) as well as those of the sn ejection processes ( @xmath82 ) do not evolve with time , @xmath180 the result of the integral is shown in for both models considered here .",
    "the main parameters of this scenario are @xmath172 and @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath172 is likely to be typically 10 g in our galaxy . at larger redshift , as discussed in ",
    "[ s : igmresults ] , @xmath172 is expected to be smaller due to the evolution of both the density of the structure and of the amplitude of the magnetic field",
    ". a lower value of @xmath172 implies that crs escape faster out of the structure , and thus produce less lithium .",
    "this can be seen directly in .",
    "indeed , one expects a strong correlation between @xmath172 and the parameter @xmath85 discussed earlier with very small values of @xmath172 corresponding to values of @xmath181 .",
    "the evolution of the abundance of li can computed directly as a function of metallicity ( see above ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , this scenario , based on the press - schechter formalism will likely break down at low redshift . if one follows the production of li up to that point @xmath20 , one can in fact place a limit to @xmath172 to avoid the over - production of li in structures . in model 1",
    ", we find that @xmath182 g @xmath183 .",
    "the upper limit in model 1e is a factor of 4 times larger .",
    "these values are so low that our choice of @xmath87 appears to have been well justified .",
    "subsequently , we expect @xmath172 to increase as the structure evolves into a galaxy where standard gcr becomes important .",
    "the observation of a li plateau in halo stars at low metallicity poses a challenge to standard models of li production via galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis .",
    "the level of the plateau is about 1000 times larger than the standard big bang nucleosynthesis value and about a factor of 10 larger than the gcrn value at [ fe / h ] = -3 .    in rvoi",
    ", we showed that an early burst of cosmic rays injected into the igm would produce a prompt initial enrichment of li .",
    "there , we used the observed plateau value to normalize the energy density of crs .",
    "here we applied this mechanism to a detailed model of cosmic chemical evolution .",
    "the model was designed to reproduce the observed star formation rate at redshift @xmath0 , the observed chemical abundances in damped lyman alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium , and to allow for an early reionization of the universe at @xmath1 as indicated by the third year results released by wmap . as a consequence , @xcite , was able to compute the supernova rate as a function of redshift .",
    "this snr was employed here to compute the resulting energy density in cosmic rays .",
    "our results depend on the efficiency to which cosmic rays are accelerated out of the first star forming structures .",
    "we found that for efficiencies , @xmath159 , the models 1 and 1e discussed in @xcite can produce a plateau in li at the right abundance level at low redshift when the sn energy deposited in crs is about 4 - 15% of the available kinetic energy .",
    "this conforms well with models of cr acceleration @xcite . as in standard gcrn ,",
    "li depletion at higher metallicities is necessary if the plateau is found to persist . by computing the cr heating of the igm",
    ", we conclude that most of the cr propagation and hence li production should be confined to the warm - hot igm .",
    "we also compute the in situ production of li in star forming structures . indeed , unless crs are allowed to escape , that is , unless the characteristic escape length is significantly smaller than 10 g/@xmath184 at high redshift the li abundance would greatly exceed the observed value .    clearly a definitive result for the production of li at high redshift or at low metallicity will require a more detailed model for the ejection and propagation of crs in the early structure forming universe .",
    "the mechanisms described here would certainly produce a plateau at low metallicity .",
    "the absolute abundance level is uncertain but can be tied to a set of reasonable chosen physical parameters .",
