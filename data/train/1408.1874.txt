    "it is well known that the dual of the projective tensor product of banach spaces @xmath2 and @xmath28 can be identified with the space of all bounded linear operators from @xmath2 to @xmath29 , so the predual of @xmath3 provided by johnson s result plays the role of the projective tensor product in the linear theory and this fact suggests to call lipschitz tensor product of @xmath1 and @xmath2 the linear subspace of the algebraic dual of @xmath3 spanned by the functionals @xmath24 . in @xcite , this space is called the space of @xmath2-valued molecules on @xmath1 , a generalization of the arens  eells space @xmath30 of scalar - valued molecules on @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it is showed that the space @xmath9 is linearly isomorphic to the space @xmath37 of all lipschitz finite - rank operators from @xmath1 to @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we give the notion of a lipschitz tensor product of a base - point preserving lipschitz map between pointed metric spaces @xmath38 and a bounded linear operator between banach spaces @xmath39 as the linear operator @xmath40 from @xmath0 to @xmath41 , defined by @xmath42    in section [ 3 ] , we consider a norm @xmath16 on @xmath0 and obtain a normed space @xmath43 and its completion @xmath44 .",

    "<S> inspired by ideas of r. schatten in his celebrated monograph @xcite on a theory of cross - spaces , we introduce the notion of a lipschitz tensor product @xmath0 of a pointed metric space @xmath1 and a banach space @xmath2 as a certain linear subspace of the algebraic dual of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that @xmath0 is linearly isomorphic to the linear space of all finite - rank continuous linear operators from @xmath4 into @xmath2 , where @xmath5 denotes the space @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the topology of pointwise convergence of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of lipschitz tensor product of elements of @xmath5 and @xmath8 yields the space @xmath9 as a certain linear subspace of the algebraic dual of @xmath0 . to ensure the good behavior of a norm on @xmath0 with respect to the lipschitz tensor product of lipschitz functionals ( mappings ) and bounded linear functionals ( operators ) , the concept of dualizable ( respectively , uniform ) lipschitz cross - norm on @xmath0 is defined . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the lipschitz injective norm @xmath10 , the lipschitz projective norm @xmath11 and the lipschitz @xmath12-nuclear norm @xmath13 @xmath14 are uniform dualizable lipschitz cross - norms on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath10 is the least dualizable lipschitz cross - norm and @xmath15 is the greatest lipschitz cross - norm on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , dualizable lipschitz cross - norms @xmath16 on @xmath0 are characterized by satisfying the relation @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the lipschitz injective ( projective ) norm on @xmath0 can be identified with the injective ( respectively , projective ) tensor norm on the banach - space tensor product between the lipschitz - free space over @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in terms of the space @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the spaces of lipschitz compact ( finite - rank , approximable ) operators from @xmath1 to @xmath8 . </S>"
