    "local potentials have been used to model the interactions of the subatomic world ever since the introduction of quantum mechanics .",
    "some of these ( like the coulomb potential ) do not differ essentially from the forces observed in nature , while most of them ( like the harmonic oscillator , for example ) represent approximations of the actual physical situation .",
    "the potential shape , defined by the potential type and the parameters in it is usually chosen in a way that reflects the physical picture our intuition associates with the problem ; therefore we can define attractive or repulsive , short - range or long - range potentials , etc .",
    "some of the potentials used in quantum mechanics are exactly solvable .",
    "this means that the energy eigenvalues , the bound - state wave functions and the scattering matrix can be determined in closed analytical form .",
    "the range of these potentials has been extended considerably in the recent years by investigations inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) , for example .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . )",
    "most of the solvable potentials are one - dimensional problems , which means that they are defined on the @xmath1 domain ( or on some finite interval of it ) , or they can be reduced to radial problems in higher spatial dimensions , in which case they are confined to the positive real axis .",
    "the simplest exactly solvable potentials are those belonging to the so - called shape - invariant class @xcite . many of the most well - known potentials , like the coulomb , harmonic oscillator , morse , pschl ",
    "teller , etc .",
    "potentials belong to this class .",
    "usually 12 potentials are mentioned to have the property of shape - invariance @xcite , although two of them are just alternative forms of other shape - invariant potentials .",
    "a rather more general potential type is that of the natanzon potentials @xcite , the solutions of which can be reduced to a single hypergeometric or confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "these potentials are written as complicated six - parameter expressions of the coordinate , and their energy eigenvalues are given by an implicit formula .",
    "although these problems are solvable exactly in principle , only some specific natanzon potentials have been studied in detail @xcite , because the formalism is getting more and more complicated with the increasing number of parameters handled .",
    "some of the natanzon potentials contain certain shape - invariant potentials as special cases : the ginocchio potential @xcite can be considered as a generalization of the pschl  teller potential , while the generalized coulomb potential @xcite is a simultaneous extension of the coulomb and the harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "there are also further potentials beyond the natanzon class .",
    "these include , for example quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) potentials @xcite , conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) potential @xcite and the susyqm partners of natanzon - class potentials @xcite , of which certain ces potentials form a subclass @xcite .",
    "the study of exactly solvable potentials represents an interesting field of mathematical physics in itself , but results from this area are also essential for the description of realistic physical problems .",
    "more and more interactions can be modeled by making advantage of the rather flexible potential shapes offered by exactly solvable potentials .",
    "the solutions of these can be applied directly , or they can be combined with numerical calculations . in the simplest case analytical calculations can aid numerical studies in areas where numerical techniques might not be safely controlled .",
    "this is the case , for example , when bound - state wave functions with arbitrary node numbers are required , for certain singular potentials , or for complex potentials @xcite . as the next level of complexity",
    ", analytical solutions can supply a basis for numerical calculations .",
    "virtually all quantum mechanical methods rely in some respect on analytically solvable potentials .",
    "very often their wave function solutions are used as a hilbert - space basis .",
    "more powerful methods can be constructed if we select a basis which allows the exact analytical calculation of the green s operator of an analytically solvable potential .",
    "some time ago by utilizing the coulomb - sturmian functions as basis functions the coulomb green s operator was calculated analytically and a quantum mechanical approximation method was developed @xcite . recently",
    "this method was extended for approaching the really challenging three - body coulomb problem @xcite .",
    "we note here that in this work the exact analytical representation of the coulomb green s operator on the coulomb ",
    "sturmian basis was essential .",
    "in our recent work @xcite we showed that if on some basis representation the hamiltonian possesses an infinite tridiagonal matrix ( j - matrix ) form then its resolvent can be given in terms of continued fractions which can be calculated analytically on the whole complex plane .",
    "this theorem was exemplified by the coulomb and harmonic oscillator green s operators .",
    "the aim of the present work is to demonstrate that various techniques developed for the simple shape - invariant potentials , like the coulomb and harmonic oscillator potentials , can be generalized for certain natanzon - class potentials too without making the formalism significantly more involved , and that these more general potentials can help our understanding of both practical and theoretical problems .",
    "the actual example we consider here is the generalized coulomb potential @xcite , which is the member of the natanzon confluent potential class @xcite .",
    "this potential is coulomb - like asymptotically , while its short - range behavior depends on the parameters : it can be finite or singular as well at the origin . its shape",
    "therefore can approximate various realistic problems , such as nuclear potentials with relatively flat central part , or atomic potentials that incorporate the effect of inner closed shells by a phenomenological repulsive core .",
    "an advantageous feature of the generalized coulomb problem is that the equivalent of the coulomb ",
    "sturmian basis can be defined for it , together with all its implications .",
    "for example , the method of calculating the matrix elements of the green s operator as described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the coulomb and the harmonic oscillator potentials can be extended to this case too , so that the above two problems appear in the present treatment as special cases .    using a particular differential realization , an su(1,1 ) algebra",
    "can also be associated with this potential , which reduces to known su(1,1 ) algebras in the coulomb and harmonic oscillator limits .",
    "another important feature of this potential is that it can be formulated as a one - dimensional problem , but it can avoid the pathologic features of the one - dimensional coulomb problem , which arise due to the @xmath2-like singularity . since this potential can be chosen to be finite at @xmath3 , it offers a convenient basis for calculations which require the use of a one - dimensional coulomb - like problem .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is the following . in section [ gcoul ]",
    "we give the basic formalism for the generalized coulomb problem by recapitulating and extending former results .",
    "section [ res ] contains the main results of the paper : _",

    "oscillator connection using the two limiting cases of the potential , _ ii ) _ the determination of the matrix elements of the green s operator , _ iii ) _ the description of an su(1,1 ) algebra associated with the problem and _ iv ) _ discussion on the one - dimensional case , which elucidates the complications related to the singularity of the one - dimensional coulomb problem .",
    "finally , we summarize the results and discuss further possibilities in sect .",
    "let us consider the schrdinger equation in @xmath0 spatial dimensions with a potential that depends only on the radial variable @xmath4 . separating the angular variables from the wave function we obtain the radial schrdinger equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the centrifugal term , which depends on the angular momentum @xmath8 originates from the kinetic term , i.e. from the @xmath0-dimensional laplace operator after separating the angular variables .",
    "the bound - state wave functions solving ( [ sch ] ) are normalized as @xmath9    here we recapitulate the results obtained for the generalized coulomb potential in ref . @xcite by adapting it to the @xmath0-dimensional case .",

    "@xcite we define the generalized coulomb potential as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined @xcite in terms of its inverse function @xmath12 the @xmath11 function maps the @xmath13 half axis onto itself and can be approximated with @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 limits , respectively .",
    "bound states are located @xcite at @xmath18 where @xmath19 the bound - state wave functions can be written in terms of associated laguerre polynomials as @xmath20    potential ( [ pot ] ) clearly carries angular momentum dependence : its first term merely compensates the centrifugal term arising from the kinetic term of the hamiltonian .",
    "its second term also has @xmath21-like singularity ( due to @xmath22 ) , and as it will be demonstrated later , it cancels the angular momentum dependent term in the two important limiting cases that recover the @xmath0-dimensional coulomb and the harmonic oscillator potentials . the third term of ( [ pot ] ) represents an asymptotically coulomb - like interaction , while the remaining two terms behave like @xmath21 and @xmath23 for large values of @xmath4 .    in the remaining part of this section we consider the specific case of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 matrix of the generalized coulomb potential can be derived in complete analogy with that of the coulomb problem for @xmath24 .",
    "although this can only be done exactly for @xmath25 , the singular term imitating the centrifugal term in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) can be defined to be part of the potential . using the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite the equivalent of the general regular and irregular solutions are @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the regular and the irregular confluent hypergeometric functions @xcite , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 have to be chosen as @xmath33 the functions ( [ regsol ] ) and ( [ irregsol ] ) reduce to @xmath34 and @xmath35 of ref .",

    "it can be seen that this potential is suitable for describing the coulomb field of extended objects .",
    "it is a general feature of potential ( [ pot ] ) that for small values of @xmath41 a ( finite ) positive peak appears near the origin , which also manifests itself in a repulsive `` hard core '' , corresponding to a region with positive charge density ( see fig .",
    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the introduction of the generalized coulomb problem was inspired by a simple method of transforming the schrdinger equation into the differential equation of the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "the bound - state solutions of these problems contain associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "the three most well - known examples of this type are the coulomb , the harmonic oscillator and the morse potentials , which are all members of the shape - invariant potential class @xcite .",
    "these three potentials are recovered by specific choices of the variable transformation reducing the schrdinger equation to the differential equation of the associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "this is also reflected by the structure of the function @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ rh ] ) : when @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath4 and @xmath42 , one obtains the coulomb problem and the harmonic oscillator potential , respectively .",
    "these limits can readily be realized by specific choices of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ rh ] ) : the first one follows from the @xmath36 limit @xcite , while the second one is reached by taking @xmath43 , while keeping @xmath44 constant @xcite .",
    "besides taking the @xmath36 limit , the coulomb problem in @xmath0-dimensions is recovered from eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) by the @xmath45 and @xmath46 , choices : the third term of ( [ pot ] ) becomes the coulomb term , the fifth one vanishes , while the other three all become proportional with @xmath21 and cancel out completely .    in order to reach the oscillator limit one also has to redefine the potential ( [ pot ] ) and the energy eigenvalues by adding @xmath47 to both .",
    "( this is equivalent to @xmath48 in the notation of ref .",
    "this choice simply represents resetting the energy scale : @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 for the coulomb problem , and to @xmath51 for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "( note that the energy eigenvalues also have different signs in the two cases . ) besides @xmath52 , the @xmath53 parameter also has to remain constant in the @xmath54 transition here .",
    "the potential thus adapted to the harmonic oscillator limit reads @xmath55 the harmonic oscillator potential is recovered from ( [ potho ] ) by the @xmath56 and @xmath57 choice .",
    "the two last terms in ( [ potho ] ) vanish , the first and the second cancel out , while the third one reproduces the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the new form of the energy eigenvalues is @xmath58 which indeed , reduces to the @xmath59 oscillator spectrum in the @xmath54 limit .",
    "the wave functions ( [ bswf ] ) are unchanged , except for the redefinition of the parameters .",
    "note that the generalized coulomb problem establishes a link between the coulomb problem and the harmonic oscillator potential in different spatial dimensions .",
    "this is best seen by inspecting the wave functions ( [ bswf ] ) . if the @xmath60 parameter of the associated laguerre polynomial is required to be the same in the two limits , we get an interrelation between the value of the angular momentum and the spatial dimension to be used for the coulomb and the harmonic oscillator case : @xmath61 considering @xmath62 , eq .",

    "the present results , therefore , extend the applicability of this method to a new potential problem .",

    "using the notation of ( [ rh ] ) , we can write that @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 . the normalization of the wave functions in ( [ bswf ] ) also has to be modified with a factor of @xmath120 , accounting for the fact that the integration now runs from @xmath121 to @xmath122 , but since the potential is symmetric , the bound - state wave functions are either even or odd , therefore @xmath123 is an even function of @xmath115 .    for one - dimensional problems",
    "it is natural to set @xmath8 to 0 besides @xmath114 , which eliminates the centrifugal term in ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid @xmath21-like singularities at @xmath3 the second term in ( [ pot ] ) also has to be canceled by setting @xmath105 to either @xmath124 or to @xmath125 .",

    "it is enough to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for @xmath177 : the @xmath178 case follows naturally .",
    "straightforward calculations show that the reflection coefficient is @xmath179 strong reflection is found for potentials having a ( finite ) barrier in @xmath3 ( like those in fig . 1 with @xmath180 ) , while more regular shapes ( like that in fig . 1 with @xmath144 and @xmath147 , for example ) give weak reflection .",
    "the @xmath181 corresponding to maximal reflection increases as @xmath41 get closer to 0 ( i.e. as the barrier at @xmath3 gets higher ) .",
    "@xmath182 is small for very large and very small values of @xmath181 .",
    "3 presents illustration for @xmath183 for various values of @xmath41 .",
    "our findings on the reflection coefficient of the one - dimensional generalized coulomb potential seem to support the existence of the space splitting effect @xcite valid for the coulomb potential on one dimension : in situations close to the true coulomb case ( e.g. @xmath36 ) @xmath184 is close to 1 , which corresponds to a nearly impenetrable barrier at @xmath3 .",
    "this is also confirmed by our analysis on other approximations of the one - dimensional coulomb potential , i.e. those with @xmath170 or @xmath171 above .    besides its mathematical aspects the one - dimensional coulomb potential has physical relevance too , in the description of the hydrogen atom in strong magnetic field @xcite , for example . in such practical calculations",
    "it is reasonable to use a non - singular coulomb - like potential instead of the true one - dimensional coulomb potential : the finite size of the nucleus can be a justification for this .",
    "this means that the one - dimensional coulomb potential might not be sufficient in such calculations : the basis defined with it simply does not contain even - parity states . in practical calculations",
    "therefore the use of bases like that assigned to the generalized coulomb potential is necessary .",
    "we analyzed the generalized coulomb potential and extended results for the @xmath0-dimensional coulomb and harmonic oscillator potentials to this potential too , which includes these two simple problems as special cases .",
    "the results presented here have both theoretical and practical significance .",
    "the theoretical aspects concern the treatment of coulomb - like problems in one dimension . due to the singular nature of the one - dimensional coulomb potential",
    "the usual methods of defining a physically relevant basis are not sufficient in this case .",
    "the generalized coulomb potential avoids these complications and it supplies a basis ( including both even and odd functions ) which can be used instead of the coulomb - sturmian basis , which is otherwise a rather helpful tool in higher dimensions , e.g.   the three - body coulomb problem has been approached this way @xcite .",
    "we also gave a unification of the su(1,1 ) algebras associated with the coulomb and harmonic oscillator problems separately .",
    "the practical aspects of our work include the introduction of the generalized coulomb - sturmian basis , which we used as a basis for analytic representation of the green s operator .",
    "the generalized coulomb potential ( being the member of the rather general natanzon potential class ) offers potential shapes that can approximate various physical problems more accurately than the conventional textbook potentials .",
    "in particular , its long - range coulomb - like behavior makes it a good candidate for describing the coulomb field of extended ( non - point - like ) charge distributions .",
    "it can be applied either directly , or as a basis for numerical calculations .",
    "its direct applications can be envisaged in describing muonic atoms , where it can model the coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "it can also be combined with short - range potentials in the potential separable expansion formalism @xcite , for example .",
    "then the coulombic asymptotics of the interaction between the strongly interacting charged objects could be taken care of by the green s operator and only the short - range ( nuclear ) interaction would have to be approximated .",
    "similar extensions of other relatively simple ( shape - invariant ) potentials also seem possible .",
    "the example of the generalized coulomb potential shows that the techniques developed for these well - known potentials can be extended to more general potentials without much technical difficulty .",
    "the generalized potentials `` inherit '' many important features of the simple potentials , of which they are extensions , and , at the same time , they can be adapted to more complex physical situations , due to their more flexible shape .",
    "there are other examples confirming the expectations that seemingly complicated formulae can be evaluated analytically even for highly non - trivial potentials . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , potentials phase - equivalent with the ginocchio potential @xcite have been determined analytically , using the transformations of supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "based on the present results we believe that the natanzon - class potentials , which have been analyzed almost exclusively in theoretical studies until now , can be used in practical applications too .",
