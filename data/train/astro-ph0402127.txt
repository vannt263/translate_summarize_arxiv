    "the two magellanic clouds have larger number density of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) compared to our galaxy .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) with a mass of about 1% of our galaxy has a total of about 70 hmxbs and hmxb candidates , almost comparable to that in our galaxy ( haberl & sasaki 2000 ; yokogawa et al .",
    "though the hmxb number density in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is not as high as that in smc , it is still significantly higher than the galactic value ( sasaki , haberl & pietsch 2000 ) . in - spite of a large number of hmxb pulsar objects in the two magellanic clouds , individual objects have not been studied in great detail except for smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4",
    "there are four hmxb pulsars known in the lmc , of which lmc  x-4 is the best studied .",
    "several of these sources show a very large x - ray luminosity in their high states , close to or exceeding the eddington limit for a 1 m@xmath0 object .",
    "sources , in which a strong local absorption column is absent , nature of the soft spectral component can be studied in detail . due to a low galactic absorption column density towards the lmc and smc ,",
    "these objects are also suitable for study of the local absorbing material",
    ". a soft excess in the x - ray spectrum , now detected in several accreting pulsars can be a common feature of the hmxb pulsars .",
    "but since most of the hmxb pulsars are in the galactic plane , large line of sight absorption usually makes it difficult to detect it .",
    "it is therefore , important to study details of the individual hmxbs in the lmc and smc .",
    "the transient be x - ray binary source exo  0531096609.2 was discovered with the exosat observatory in 1983 ( pietsch , rosso & dennerl 1989 ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission from this source was detected with the sl2 xrt experiment ( hanson et al .",
    "1989 ) and its intensity variations were studied in detail with the rosat ( haberl , dennerl , & pietsch 1995 ) .",
    "x - ray pulsations were also discovered with the rosat ( dennerl , haberl & pietsch 1995 ) .",
    "this pulsar is located at a distance of 17@xmath1 from the luminous binary x - ray pulsar lmc  x-4 , and has a pulse period of 13.7 s , which is also close to the 13.5 s pulse period of lmc  x-4 . during a beppo - sax observation of lmc  x-4 ,",
    "exo  0531096609.2 was in the field of view of the narrow field instruments of beppo - sax , and pulsations were detected along with a positive local period derivative ( burderi et al .",
    "the source was also observed with the xmm in 2000 during which it was in a relatively bright state ( haberl , dennerl , & pietsch 2003 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart is one of the two close double be - stars ( stevens , coe and buckley 1999 )    in the subsequent sections we present the archival observations that we have used to study this source (  2 ) , results from temporal and spectral analysis of the data (  3 ) and follow up this with a discussion on the nature of this pulsar (  4 ) .",
    "we have analysed archival data from four observations of the pulsar exo  0531096609.2 .",
    "three of these observations were made with the beppo - sax observatory and one with the asca .",
    "the field of exo  0531096609.2 was covered by asca - gis during several observations of nearby sources . in one observation of lmc",
    "x-4 , made during 1996 may 2426 , we found exo  0531096609.2 to be bright enough for temporal and spectral investigation .",
    "it was also present in the field of view of the beppo - sax narrow field instruments during two observations of lmc  x-4 in 1997 ( march 1315 ) and 1998 ( october 2022 ) and in another one observation of the lmc in 2000 ( january 0102 ) .",
    "exo  0531096609.2 was in a transient outburst during the 1997 observation and the pulsation properties during this period have been reported earlier ( burderi et .",
    "al . 1998 ) .",
    "we have found 36 ks of useful exposure with asca - gis , 117 , 82 and 32 ks with sax - mecs ( 1997 , 1998 and 2000 respectively ) , and 42 , 31 and 15 ks with sax - lecs . for more details of these instruments , refer to tanaka , inoue & holt ( 1994 , asca ) and boella et al .",
    "( 1997 , sax ) .",
    "we have used the standard data selection criteria of both the observatories .",
    "the count rates and spectra of the source were obtained from circular regions of radius 6@xmath1 for asca - gis , 3@xmath1 for sax - mecs and 2@xmath1 for sax - lecs .",
    "the corresponding background spectra were extracted from source free nearby regions in the respective fovs .",
    "light curves from these observations were extracted with time resolution of 0.25 s for sax lecs and mecs and 0.50 s for asca - gis .",
    "barycenter corrections were applied to the photon arrival times in the event files before extraction of light curves .",
    "the pulse folding and @xmath2 maximisation search near the expected pulse period of 13.7 s clearly showed presence of pulsations in all the observations .",
    "the new pulse period measurements with asca - gis and beppo - sax lecs / mecs are given in table 1 and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "pulse profiles were created from background subtracted light curves in different energy bands .",
    "the pulse profiles of all but the 1997 beppo - sax observation are shown in figure 2 along with the dates of each observation and the 210 kev luminosity of the source during the corresponding observation .",
    "there is a hint of slight energy dependence of the pulse profile in the asca observation .",
    "the pulse profile clearly shows a luminosity dependence ; a single peaked profile at low luminosity ( asca 1996 , sax 1998 , top panels of figure 2 . ) and a double peaked profile at high luminosity .",
    "the pulse fraction is in the range of 3060% .    the pulse period history of exo  0531096609.2 , obtained by combining the new observations and the earlier reported measurements with the rosat , beppo - sax and xmm observatories are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "an overall spin - down trend during the last five years and some local variation from this trend can be seen in the figure .",
    "the orbital elements of this binary system is not known , and we note that an orbital motion of the neutron star with a velocity of a few hundred km s@xmath3 can also result in the observed changes in the local pulse period measurements .",
    "suitable binning was applied to all the energy spectra before spectral fitting .",
    "we first fitted the asca - gis spectrum with a simple model consisting of a power - law component and line of sight absorption with solar abundance of metals .",
    "the source was in a low intensity state during this asca observation .",
    "we rebinned the spectrum to 12 spectral bins in the 0.79.0 kev range .",
    "a photon index of 0.46 and equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath4 atoms @xmath5 was obtained with a reduced @xmath2 of 0.23 for 9 degrees of freedom . assuming a distance of 55 kpc to the lmc , the x - ray luminosity during the asca observation was @xmath6 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "no signature of iron fluorescence was detected and a broad binning scheme needed due to the poor statistics also does not allow us to put a strong upper limit on the equivalent width of a line feature at 6.4 kev . the spectrum measured with asca - gis",
    "is shown in figure 3 along with the best fit model spectrum and the residuals .",
    "in all the three beppo - sax observations , the source exo  0531096609.2 was at a distance of about 17@xmath1 away from the centre of the field of view .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to consider the smaller collecting area of the mirrors at large off - axis angles . for spectral analysis of mecs spectra at an off - axis angle of 17@xmath1 , we have taken an average of the effective areas at 14@xmath1 and 20@xmath1 , which are available for the mecs .",
    "this is likely to introduce a few percent uncertainty in the measurements of spectral parameters over the statistical errors . at low energies ,",
    "the relative loss of effective area for different off - axis angles is not energy dependent .",
    "therefore , the lecs spectra were fitted with the on - axis effective area curve , and a relative normalisation with respect to the mecs was used .",
    "all the three beppo - sax observations were fitted with the same spectral model described above . in the 1997 and 2000 observations",
    ", there was some signature of an iron emission line , and a separate narrow gaussian line at 6.4 kev was included in the model .",
    "the equivalent width of the iron line during these two observations were 130 @xmath7 50 ev and 180 @xmath7 160 ev respectively .",
    "the spectral parameters along with the reduced @xmath2 obtained are given in table 2 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities in the 2.010.0 kev band during the three sax observations are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 during the 1997 , 1998 and 2000 observations respectively .",
    "the spectra measured with beppo - sax lecs and mecs instruments are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the pulsar exo  0531096609.2 , like many other hmxb pulsars with be star companions , is believed to be a transient source .",
    "however , we have found this pulsar to be bright , at a luminosity level of @xmath11 erg s@xmath3 to @xmath12 erg s@xmath3 in most of the x - ray observations made since 1993 with the low background imaging instruments .",
    "several rosat observations during march to may 1993 also found the source to have significant x - ray intensity ( haberl et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this respect , this pulsar is more akin to 4u  1907 + 09 ( int zand 1999 , mukerjee et al .",
    "2001 ) , which also shows intensity variations of similar scale but without any obvious transient phenomena .",
    "its long term x - ray intensity behaviour is different from that of the be - star transients like exo  2030 + 375 ( parmar , white & stella 1989 ) .",
    "the peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath12 erg s@xmath3 observed in 1997 is however , much smaller than that of the pulsars smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 ( paul et al .",
    "2002 ) , which have high mass companion stars in very close orbits .",
    "this indicates a large size orbit and hence orbital period .",
    "the archival x - ray observations are not sufficiently long to search for pulse arrival time delay that can help to determine the orbital parameters . analysing the rxte - asm light curve of exo",
    "0531096609.2 we have found a peak in the power spectrum at 183 days and its integer multiples .",
    "intensity variations of the bright nearby source lmc  x-4 is unlikely to create this because the 30.5 day superorbital intensity variation of lmc  x-4 is not reflected in the power spectrum of exo  0531096609.2 .",
    "however , since this is very close to a half - year , yearly observational effects can not be ruled out .    combining the present observations with the earlier measurements of pulse periods with the rosat and the beppo - sax , we have obtained a period history of the pulsar , shown in figure 1 .",
    "it shows a clear monotonic spin - up trend since the asca observation in 1996 , though not with a constant period derivative . however , certainly there were spin - down episodes between the 1991 rosat observation and the 1996 asca observation .",
    "a spin - down was also observed during the 1997 beppo - sax observation itself , which is a surprise considering the high intensity level during this observation .",
    "the last 5 years of pulse period measurements presented here shows a spin - up of the neutron star .",
    "this suggests that accretion onto the neutron star was in progress for at least a significant part of this period .",
    "however , we can not rule out a significant binary motion related component in the observed pulse period variations",
    ".    the x - ray emission from the polar cap regions can have different geometric pattern at different mass accretion rates . in the transient x - ray pulsar exo 2030 + 375 ,",
    "a change in beaming pattern , from a fan beam in high luminosity state to a pencil - beam in low luminosity state was observed with the exosat ( parmar et al .",
    "the pulse profiles of exo  0531096609.2 at different luminosity levels presented here and elsewhere ( burderi et al . 1998 , haberl et al .",
    "2003 ) clearly indicate a dependence on the mass accretion rate .",
    "the pulse profile is single peaked and nearly sinusoidal in low intensity state ( beppo - sax : 1998 ) , and it has two distinct well separated peaks or an admixture of the above two during other observations .",
    "it is possible that in exo  0531096609.2 also , the x - ray beam pattern changes from a pencil beam at low luminosity to a fan beam at high luminosity .",
    "the change in beam pattern probably takes place at a luminosity level of @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 .    during the asca observation in 1996 and the beppo - sax observation in 1998 , the source was in low intensity state and the spectral parameters",
    "are not constrained well from these observations .",
    "however , the spectral characteristics reported here from the other three observations indicate intrinsic spectral variability in the pulsar . the power - law component of the spectrum is softer at higher luminosity .",
    "the xmm spectrum of this source unambiguously showed the presence of a soft spectral component in excess of a partially absorbed hard power - law extended to lower energies ( haberl et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the same observation also showed that the pulse profile is different in the soft and the hard x - ray bands .",
    "this indicates that the soft component may have a different origin , or at least the geometry of emission is different in different energy ranges .",
    "presence of narrow features in the soft excess prompted haberl et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to use a hot plasma model that yields a temperature of 0.1 kev and emission measure of 4 @xmath14 10@xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "such a plasma is unlikely to show pulsations due to its large physical size and large cooling time scale , contrary to what is seen in the 0.15 - 0.4 kev band .",
    "a blackbody type component with separate low energy emission lines as seen in her x-1 ( endo et al . 2000 ) may be a better description of the soft excess of this pulsar .",
    "several other accreting x - ray pulsars with relatively low line of sight absorption show soft excess ( paul et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) . in some sources",
    "the soft excess probably originates in a part of the x - ray irradiated inner accretion disk ( endo et al .",
    "2000 ; naik & paul 2004 ) . from independent analysis of the xmm spectra",
    "we have found that in exo  0531096609.2 , the total luminosity of unabsorbed x - ray emission in the soft excess is @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 , which is only about 1% of the total emission in the 110 kev energy band .",
    "the ratio of the soft excess flux to the total flux is smaller than that of smc  x-1 ( 3.6% ) , lmc  x-4 ( 6.4% ) and her  x-1 ( 10% ) . in this pulsar , the size of the black body emission region",
    "is required to be only about @xmath18 cm and , therefore , can easily be accommodated in inner part of the accretion disk heated by the hard x - rays .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for valuable suggestions .",
