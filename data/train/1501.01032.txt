    "strongly interacting non - abelian gauge theories are described by @xmath1 algebras .",
    "these theories possess a strong coupling in the low temperature regime prohibiting perturbative treatment .",
    "in addition , the associated degrees of freedom occur exclusively in a confined phase . in higher temperatures , near and above the critical point of @xmath1 gauge theories",
    ", it is expected that the interaction of fermions and gauge fields , namely quarks and gluons in the case of @xmath0 color ( qcd ) , is significantly weaker , leading to the deconfined phase known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp)@xcite . the thermodynamical treatment of qgp has led to the introduction of quasi - particle models ( qpms ) @xcite , primarily aiming to explain the qgp equation of state as obtained from lattice gauge theory simulations of qcd at finite temperature . in these models and at temperatures higher than the critical value it was assumed that the thermodynamics of a system of interacting massless gluons may be approached by an ideal gas of massive noninteracting gluons .",
    "however , the above models @xcite failed to explain the most recent lattice results @xcite .    due to asymptotic freedom",
    ", the interaction of quarks and gluons is expected to be very weak at extremely high temperatures .",
    "thus , in these thermodynamic conditions the picture of an ideal gas of ( almost ) non - interacting particles for the quark - gluon system should provide a good approximation .",
    "nevertheless , as supported by the results of the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature @xmath2 , associated with the transition from hadronic matter to qgp , the interaction is strong and the quark - gluon system is far from the ideal gas scenario @xcite sharing features of a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "this holds in particular also for the gluon field alone where accurate lattice results @xcite demonstrate that the gluon system remains far from the ideal behaviour even for temperatures @xmath3 times larger than @xmath2 .",
    "a useful and common strategy is to restrict the analysis to the gluonic sector considering the emergence of a ( non - ideal ) gluon plasma above the associated critical temperature . to capture this non - ideal behaviour",
    "the qpms @xcite introduce temperature dependent parameters which are suitably adjusted in order to fit the existing lattice results .",
    "a basic assumption of these models is the presence of a temperature dependent mass for the gluons , a property which may lead to thermodynamic inconsistencies @xcite within the landau statistical approach @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the temperature dependent mass becomes a thermodynamic quantity affecting the usual relations connecting pressure with energy density .",
    "this inconsistency may be healed by introducing an appropriate constraint in models involving vacuum energy @xmath4 @xcite . however , a much more natural way to overcome this issue is to use the pathria @xcite approach starting the calculations of thermodynamic quantities and equation of state from the energy density instead of the pressure @xcite .",
    "the pressure is obtained via the integration of a fundamental thermodynamic relation , taking into account the temperature dependence of the gluon mass @xcite .",
    "the latter is determined by fitting the lattice results for the equation of state of pure @xmath0 at finite temperature @xcite . with the suitable temperature dependence for the gluon mass ,",
    "the description of lattice data with such an improved qpm turns out to be quite satisfactory .",
    "however , despite of being free from thermodynamic inconsistencies qpms still include controversial issues from the physical point of view .",
    "the use of massive gluons and their treatment as free particles is not fully justified . to resolve this issue , a recent work @xcite assumed that the gluon mass emerges through the propagation of gluons in a plasma environment as a collective effect and is furthermore related to the associated plasma frequency .",
    "lattice results for the equation of state are sufficiently reproduced with the use of a single temperature dependent parameter .",
    "regarding the origin of gluon mass , a consistent interpretation is possible in terms of classical solutions of the corrensponding gauge theory equations of motion ( e.g see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , @xcite derives a class of nonlinear plane wave @xmath5 solutions obeying a massive relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "the mass parameter is free to vary as a consequence of the scale invariance of the yang - mills lagrangian . despite the fact that such a scenario is based on fundamental properties of yang - mills dynamics",
    "it has not been associated with the gluon mass in qpms up to now .    a novel aspect in the framework of qpms emerged by recent lattice @xmath0 calculations of the temperature dependence of the dynamically generated gluon mass by estimating the inverse gluon propagator in the infra - red limit @xcite .",
    "these calculations obtained the gluon mass for a temperature regime just above the critical point , providing further constraints in the phenomenology of qpms .",
    "there are some important consequences of the lattice results : firstly the dynamical masses of the transverse and longitudinal gluon degrees of freedom differ at low temperatures . secondly both masses ( longitudinal and transverse ) behave smoothly as a function of the temperature just beyond the critical point .",
    "thus , the stiff increase of quasiparticle masses as the critical region is approached from above , is incompatible with the lattice @xcite .",
    "a solution to this controversy has been proposed in the framework of qpms through a polyakov loop coupling to the quasiparicles @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we develop a qpm which takes into account the most recent lattice results for the temperature dependence of the dynamical gluon mass @xcite and at the same time is in consistency with the older lattice calculations of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "the proposed model suggests that the non - linear plane wave solutions of the equations of motion correspond to quasi - particles with variable mass .",
    "we develop such a scenario based on a subset of classical solutions for the gauge field , namely those which originate from the @xmath5-sector contained in @xmath0 , assuming that the main characteristics of its non - abelian character are captured by this class .",
    "we demonstrate that the non - abelian character of the gluons introduces significant changes in their thermodynamical treatment which are taken into account in the proposed qpm .",
    "in contrast to other statistical models which use glueballs with a discrete mass spectrum @xcite here we assume a continuously varying gluon mass characterized by a specific probability density . to take into account the difference between transverse and longitudinal masses , as calculated from the lattice , we use two different mass distributions for transverse and longitudinal gluonic degrees of freedom respectively .",
    "furthermore , since the gluon mass distributions are unknown we choose truncated gaussians ( negative mass values are excluded ) in each case .",
    "the lattice results ( extrapolating to high temperatures when necessary)@xcite are employed to fix the temperature depended mean transverse and longitudinal masses . to reduce the number of free parameters we further assume that the variation is the same in both quasi - gaussian distributions .",
    "thus , the temperature depended variance is the only free parameter in our model which is determined via a fit to the lattice results for the @xmath0 equation of state @xcite .",
    "the main success of the proposed non - abelian quasi - particle model ( naqpm ) is the very good description of two different lattice results for the gluon plasma using a single free parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the non - linear plane wave solutions of the @xmath5 yang - mills theory and we reveal their properties which are relevant for the subsequent formulation of the naqpm . in section iii",
    "we introduce the naqpm for the gluon plasma and the corresponding statistical treatment . in section",
    "iv we discuss our results concerning the dependence of the parameters of the proposed model on temperature as well as their compatibility with existing lattice results . finally , in section v we give our concluding remarks .",
    "a simplified description of the gluon field , capturing the basic phenomenological characteristics , can be obtained by the classical @xmath5 yang - mills theory .",
    "since @xmath5 is a subgroup of @xmath0 , we will restrict our analysis to this case which is easier to handle and at the end of this section we will give some arguments supporting that our treatment can be transferred to the more realistic description with colored @xmath0 yang - mills . neglecting fermionic ( matter ) degrees of freedom the lagrangian density of this model",
    "is written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the antisymmetric field tensor @xmath8 of the gauge field @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding classical equations of motion for the gauge field are : @xmath10 the equations ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) permit plane wave solutions of the form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a scalar function of the plane wave phase @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) is given by @xmath17 the momentum four - vector @xmath18 satisfies the dispersion relation @xmath19 for an arbitrary mass parameter @xmath20 . note that the three columns ( @xmath15 ) of the above matrix  ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) are non - other than the three orthonormal spacelike vectors   holds . ] , orthogonal also to the timelike four - momentum vector @xmath21 . as such",
    ", the solution obeys automatically the lorentz gauge condition @xmath22 since for plane waves it becomes equivalent to the transversality condition @xmath23 .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) is most conveniently derived by the authors of @xcite on the proper time frame @xmath24 with the gauge fixing condition @xmath25 . on that frame ,",
    "@xmath26 with all other components equal to zero and @xmath27 satisfying the equation : @xmath28 the above equation possesses solutions of the form : @xmath29= cn[\\sqrt{2}\\xi;\\frac{1}{2 } ] \\label{eq : eq7}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 ( cn[\\xi;k^2])$ ] is the jacobi elliptic sine ( cosine ) function with elliptic modulus @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , the solutions ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) describe periodic ( anharmonic ) plane waves with period @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the period numerically becomes @xmath35 .",
    "a lorentz boost with parameters @xmath36 leads immediately to the general form ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) .",
    "the origin of the mass of the gluon field @xmath20 is traced in the non - linear terms in the lagrangian ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) due to the gluon self - interaction .",
    "furthermore , @xmath20 is free to take any positive value , reflecting the scale invariance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) .",
    "thus , although scale - free , the yang - mills classical solutions depend on an arbitrary mass - scale @xmath20 due to the nonlinearity of the theory",
    ".    solutions of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq7 ] ) are also found in the @xmath37 scalar field theory forming a complete ( non - orthogonal ) basis @xcite for this system .",
    "since there is a mapping of yang - mills @xmath1 to the scalar @xmath37 theory @xcite one may argue that the solutions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq7 ] ) provide also a non - orthogonal basis for @xmath0 yang - mills gauge theory .",
    "the question is if and how the non - linear plane waves ( [ eq : eq7 ] ) can capture the main features of gluon plasma thermodynamics .",
    "undoubtedly they will influence the counting of gluon microstates .",
    "the period of the non - linear plane waves is not @xmath38 but @xmath35 , thus the number of such stationary states fitting in a fixed volume @xmath39 is greater that the corresponding number for linear plane waves by a factor @xmath40 .",
    "let us now proceed with the formulation of the naqpm as discussed in the introduction .",
    "it is useful to list the main assumptions of the model :    * the microstates of the gluon field at thermal equilibrium consist from non - linear plane wave solutions of the @xmath5 classical equations of motion with period @xmath35 .",
    "such classical field configurations in quark - gluon plasma studies have been used before @xcite . within our treatment the classical @xmath5 non - linear plane",
    "waves correspond to massive quasi - particles with a variable mass @xmath20 .",
    "since the @xmath0 algebra contains three @xmath5 subspaces , there exist three different ways to embed the above @xmath5 solution in @xmath0 .",
    "the vanisihing trace condition reduces by one the diagonal degrees of freedom , thus we effectively identify eight degrees of freedom , in consistency with the full @xmath0 case . in a more precise sense , the naqpm does not consider the entire @xmath0 solution space but rather the locally isomorphic case of @xmath41 algebra .",
    "nevertheless , this space contains the basic ingredient of the non - abelian character , namely the non - linearity due to the gauge field self - interaction .",
    "a recent publication @xcite has found a larger class of @xmath0 plane wave solutions which could in principle be included in the present model .",
    "however , these solutions possess an infinite countable set of periods in contrast to the solutions in the @xmath5 subspace which have fixed period @xmath35 .",
    "thus , their inclusion is highly non - trivial and goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "* lattice calculations provide evidence that the transverse and longitudinal gluonic degrees of freedom acquire temperature depended masses which differ at low temperatures and approach each other as the temperature increases @xcite . for sufficiently high temperatures",
    "these masses attain a common asymptotic linear dependence on the temperature in accordance with perturbation theory predictions @xcite . in the naqpm",
    "this information is incorporated assuming quasi - gaussian ( with restriction to positive values only ) distributions for the gluon mass @xmath20 which have well determined but different , temperature dependent , mean values @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the transverse ( tr ) and longitudinal ( lo ) gluonic degrees of freedom respectively . in each case",
    "the average is meant over the microstates of the corresponding gluon components ( transverse or longitudinal ) with temperature depended weights .",
    "in such a description the associated variances @xmath44 and @xmath45 depend also on temperature and present mass related response functions of the gluonic system . * within the naqpm the temperature depended parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are fixed by the recent lattice results @xcite on the gluon propagator . since we need to calculate thermodynamic properties of the gluon system also for temperatures beyond those investigated in @xcite , we will appropriately extrapolate @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this extrapolation takes into account that in the high temperature regime both quantities approach each other and attain asymptotically a linear temperature dependence as dictated by perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the variances @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the free parameters of the model which are determined in order to fit the lattice results on the equation of state of the @xmath0 yang - mills theory @xcite .",

    "a final comment is in order here . as seen in fig .",
    "2b , when approaching the critical point an increase of the variance @xmath81 is observed which does not appear in the plot of the masses shown in fig .  2a .",
    "thus , within naqpm criticality is reflected in the temperature dependence of @xmath81 which defines naturally a measure for the mass fluctuations .",
    "this allows for an interpretation of the gluon deconfining transition as a change in the gluon mass spectrum .",
    "we have introduced a quasi - particle model for the thermodynamical description of the gluon plasma which takes non - abelian characteristics into account . in particular ,",
    "the microstates building up the statistical ensemble for the gluon are determined from non - linear plane wave solutions of the associated classical dynamics , containing a free mass parameter .",
    "they correspond to quasi - particles with a continuously varying mass having a quasi - gaussian distribution with temperature dependent mean mass and variance . to bridge the gap with the lattice @xcite we use different mean masses for transverse and longitudinal gluonic degrees of freedom keeping a common variance .",
    "tuning appropriately the variance @xmath81 , which is the only free parameter in our model , we reproduce with high accuracy the results of the most recent lattice calculations for the gluon plasma equation of state . at the same time",
    "we avoid singular behaviour of the mean mass close to the critical point , a feature which is common in qpms but is in contradiction to lattice results . in our approach",
    "the traces of the transition to the gluon plasma phase are imprinted on the rapid increase of the gluon mass variance in the neighbourhood of the critical point .",
    "it would be interesting to look for a similar behaviour in the phase diagram when matter degrees of freedom are included .",
    "however , this is left for future investigations .",

    "<S> we propose a quasi - particle model for the thermodynamic description of the gluon plasma which takes into account non - abelian characteristics of the gluonic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished utilizing massive non - linear plane wave solutions of the classical equations of motion with a variable mass parameter , reflecting the scale invariance of the yang - mills lagrangian . for the statistical description of the gluon plasma we interpret these non - linear waves as quasi - particles with a temperature dependent mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> quasi - gaussian distributions with a common variance but different temperature dependent mean masses for the longitudinal and transverse modes are employed . </S>",
    "<S> we use recent lattice results to fix the mean transverse and longitudinal masses while the variance is fitted to the equation of state of pure @xmath0 on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our model succeeds to obtain both a consistent description of the gluon plasma energy density as well as a correct behaviour of the mass parameters near the critical point .    </S>",
