    "the choice of color space is an important task in various computer vision applications such as image compression @xcite , and annotation @xcite , object detection @xcite or object tracking @xcite .",

    "they use the liu and borsotti segmentation evaluation method to determine what color space provides the best segmentation .",
    "similar adaptive approaches also have been applied to applications such as sky / cloud @xcite or skin @xcite segmentation .    using",
    "the right color space is also important in object detection and recognition applications .",

    "the authors highlight that changes in color luminance have little effect on separating skin from non - skin regions . in the context of cast shadow detection , benedek and sziranyi @xcite evaluate numerous color spaces such as _ hsv _ , _ rgb _ and _ luv _ , and show that using _ luv _",
    "color space is the most efficient for color based clustering of the pixels and foreground - background - shadow segmentation .",

    "@xcite evaluate different color spaces in conjunction with sift features for object detection .",
    "they argue that depending on the nature of the dataset using different color spaces such as opponent axis or _ rgb _ can result in the best performance .",
    "@xcite combine three color spaces including _",
    "c1c2c3 _ , opponent axis and _ rgb",
    "_ to generate shadow invariant features to detect objects by finding their contours .",
    "moreover , there are a number of works that investigate the suitability of color spaces for texture classification of objects such as textile @xcite and tree @xcite classification .    in robotics , color spaces",
    "are also studied for various applications .",
    "@xcite use a genetic algorithm to generate a color space suitable for recognition of colored objects in the context of robotic soccer .",

    "rsc2 _ , the highest recognition rate can be achieved compared to spaces such as _ yuv _ or _",
    "hsi_. in a similar study @xcite , the authors propose the _ usb _ color space based on an iterative feature selection procedure for recognition of colored objects for underwater robotics .",
    "@xcite investigate the optimal color space for segmentation of aerial images captured by unmanned uavs .",
    "the authors report that for bayer true color images , the _ i1i2i3 _",
    "color space is the optimal choice for the segmentation of buildings compared to _ ycbcr _ , _ yiq _ or _",
    "lab_.    in the context of robotic visual search , color features can be used to optimize the process of search @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors use the sought object s color in a top - down control manner to bias the search . if the sought object is outside detection range , its color features are used to guide the search . the similarity between detected colors and the color of the object",
    "is measured using a backprojection technique .",
    "if a similarity is observed , the importance of the corresponding regions is increased , therefore the robot searches those regions first .",
    "the authors show that using this method , the time of search can be significantly reduced . in @xcite , however , the authors only use normalized _ rgb _ color space and the search is only performed for a single red and green toy .    in this paper",
    "we first investigate the impact of color space selection on detection of objects with different colors ( detectability ) and then using a cluster scoring technique identify how well different color groups can be separated ( discriminability ) using each color space .",
    "we perform this evaluation for the 20 most common color spaces in the literature using both synthetic and real images .",
    "finally , we use active visual search as an application to examine the role of color space selection in practice .",
    "we evaluated 20 color spaces ( see table [ table_color_spaces ] ) including the rgb space .",
    "[ table_color_spaces ]    as mentioned earlier , our objective is to evaluate the suitability of color spaces for various applications , in particular , detecting and distinguishing colored objects . in this sense ,",
    "two factors have to be considered .",
    "first , the color should be represented in a way that it is easily detectable ( _ detectability _ ) under various conditions such as in the presence of shadow , illumination changes or various reflecting surfaces .",
    "second , different color groups should be easily separable ( _ discriminability _ ) and not confused with one another . measuring the _ detectability _ and _ discriminability _ of colors in different color spaces accounts for",
    "how robust a color representation can be .",
    "we measure the detectability of different colors using the histogram backprojection ( bp ) technique @xcite .",
    "the bp algorithm generates a probability map in which the pixel values refer to how likely is the presence of a given color in the image .",
    "the computation of the bp map is as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be the histogram function which maps color space @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3 channel of @xmath4 , to a bin of histogram @xmath5 computed from the objects template , @xmath6 .",
    "the backprojection of the object s color over an image @xmath7 is given by , @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the grayscale backprojection image .",
    "choosing the right bin size for histograms is vital in the bp algorithm .",
    "the larger the size of the bins , the more tolerant bp is to the illumination change . at the same time different colors will likely be detected together .",
    "to eliminate bias in our detection , we use histograms with bin sizes of 16 , 32 , 64 and 128 and average the results over all configurations .",
    "we compare the detection results against the ground truth data and use 3 measures of performance , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 stand for true positive , false negative and false positive respectively .",
    "one way to measure discriminability ( separability ) of colors in different spaces is by performing clustering and measuring how well the color data is grouped into different clusters . for this purpose",
    "we use a _ k - means _ clustering technique using expectation maximization ( em ) to find the maximum number of clusters that best represent the color distributions in each image .",
    "the number of clusters depends on the number of colors ( out of 12 colors of the traditional color wheel , see figure [ fig : color_wheel ] ) present in the input image .",
    "we employ silhouette analysis @xcite to measure the consistency of each cluster against the ground truth .",
    "let @xmath15 be a single pixel in the image and @xmath16 be the cluster that @xmath15 belongs to .",
    "we define @xmath17 as the average dissimilarity of pixel @xmath15 to all other pixels in cluster @xmath16 .",
    "we define @xmath18 as the average dissimilarity of @xmath15 to all other pixels in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "based on these definitions , the silhouette measure @xmath21 of pixel @xmath15 is given by , @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the value of 1 means pixel @xmath15 is well clustered whereas -1 implies that it does not belong to the allocated cluster .",
    "we setup a simulated environment to capture the robustness of the color spaces to various illumination conditions .",
    "the following setups were considered for our simulation .",
    "_ objects - _ to model different surfaces we used objects with three different shapes namely , sphere , cylinder and cube ( see figure [ fig : objects ] )        _ colors - _ we used 12 colors of the traditional color wheel depicted in figure [ fig : color_wheel ] .",
    "the traditional color wheel is chosen because it represents three basic color schemes including primary , secondary and tertiary colors .",
    "_ configuration - _ the objects where placed on a circle with the radius of 2 meters from the center and equally distant from one another ( see figure [ fig : envconfig ] ) .",
    "_ camera - _ we used a camera model same as the zed stereo camera with @xmath24 fov and 1280 @xmath25 1024 resolution placed on a rod with the height of 1 meter .",
    "the camera was rotated 12 times along a circle with radius of 3 meters and each time it was placed 1 meter away from the closest object while facing towards it .",
    "_ light - _ we used two types of light sources , directional and point , placed 10 meters above the scene . to vary illumination conditions , the directional light source was rotated along the y - axis with an interval of @xmath26 forming a total of 12 orientations .",
    "the point light source also was rotated along an arc in the x - z plane by @xmath26 within an interval of @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the arc also was rotated along z - axis 6 times equally within an interval of @xmath28 $ ] ( see figure [ fig : campose ] ) .        [",
    "fig : campose ]    using the above setups a total of 4752 simulated images where generated .",
    "figure [ fig : sim_samples ] shows some sample synthetic images that were generated under various lighting conditions .",
    "+   +      a total of 60 real images are collected from the web representing different materials , object shapes and lighting conditions . unlike the synthetic images ,",
    "the real images only contain a subset of the 12 colors .",
    "therefore we selected them so that all colors are reasonably distributed .",
    "figure [ fig : real_samples ] illustrates some of the images used in the experiments .",
    "+   +   +    [ fig : real_samples ]",
    "we evaluated our samples both with and without normalization ( pixel - wise normalization of each channel ) . in the latter method",
    "pixel - wise normalization was used to reduce the effect of illumination changes .",
    "the normalization took place on the original rgb images and was computed by dividing each pixel value in each channel by the sum of values in all channels .    in the following subsection we use the following abbreviations for each color category : blue - green ( bg ) , blue ( b ) , green ( g ) , green - yellow(gy ) , orange ( o ) , orange - red ( or ) , red ( r ) , red - violet ( rv ) , violet - blue ( vb ) , violet ( v ) , yellow - orange ( yo ) , and yellow ( y ) .",
    "performing backprojection ( bp ) on the original images without pixel - wise normalization , the scores in the majority of the color spaces are fairly low .",
    "this is due to the high degree of illumination changes in the images .",
    "the only color spaces that perform well are the photometric color invariants ( _ c1c2c3 _ , _ nopp _ and _ rg _ ) which describe color configuration of image discounting the effect of shadow or highlights .    to compensate for the changes in illumination , the spaces _ nopp _ and _ rg _ normalize the pixel values of each channel by dividing by the sum of pixel values in all channels .",
    "the _ c1c2c3 _",
    "color space achieves the illumination invariant behavior by calculating each channel value by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "after pixel - wise normalization , the results are changed significantly .",
    "the highlight is that the scores of the top three color spaces before normalization deteriorate due to loss of information as a result of double normalization . on the contrary ,",
    "all other methods perform dramatically better due to reducing the effect of illumination changes .",
    "figure [ fig : sim_overall_norm ] shows the scores after normalization .",
    "the best performance is achieved in color spaces _ hsi@xmath32 _ , _",
    "uvw@xmath32 _ and _ xyz@xmath32_. the prime sign ( @xmath32 ) indicates the color space is applied after pixel - wise normalization of the input image .",
    "in addition , despite the drop in the performance of _ c1c2c3 _ , it still remains one of the top 5 color spaces .",
