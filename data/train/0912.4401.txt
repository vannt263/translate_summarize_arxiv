    "hd  24712 ( hr  1217 , do eri ) is a prototype of the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars that consist of about 40 members .",
    "the oscillations , with periods ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10  min , are high radial - order p - modes affected by strong magnetic fields of 1  kg to 25  kg .    the 6.15 minute light variation of hd  24712 was discovered by @xcite . @xcite",
    "first discovered radial velocity ( rv ) variations with an amplitude of @xmath11ms@xmath12 . a wet ( whole earth telescope ) campaign found eight frequencies with rotational side - lobes as presented in @xcite ; the paper also gives a thorough review of preceding research on this star . from accurate rv measurements",
    "@xcite obtained two additional frequencies .",
    "@xcite ( paper i ) studied oscillation amplitudes and phases corresponding to the two highest amplitude modes for @xmath13600 unblended spectral lines of different elements / ions , and found a diversity of these pulsational characteristics in two thirds of them .",
    "the magnetic field of hd  24712 has been studied by many authors as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a polar magnetic strength of @xmath14  kg , a rotational inclination ( angle between line - of - sight and rotation axis ) of @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) and a magnetic obliquity ( the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes ) of @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite found that a slightly higher strength of @xmath19  kg is more consistent with their polarimetric observations .",
    "recently , by inverting rotationally modulated polarized spectra , @xcite found that hd  24712 has a nearly dipole magnetic field with the strength varying between 2.2  kg and 4.4  kg , depending on the rotation phase .",
    "one of the reasons why oscillations of roap stars are important lies in the fact that many ( often regularly spaced ) oscillation frequencies are excited simultaneously giving great potential for asteroseismic studies .",
    "one difficulty in applying asteroseismology to roap stars is that strong magnetic fields affect the high - order p - modes in complex ways .",
    "although the frequency of an oscillation mode generally increases with increasing magnetic field strength , it occasionally jumps down by @xmath20 to @xmath21hz and then starts increasing again @xcite . at present , there are three independent methods to calculate magnetic effects on high - order p - modes : the method of @xcite is based on a variational principle , the other two use truncated expansions with spherical harmonics to present the angular dependences of eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "the results from those three methods roughly agree with each other as discussed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "a further complexity arises if the rotation effect is taken into account .",
    "@xcite investigated the oscillation properties taking into account both effects of rotation and magnetic field . in our present investigation , however , we disregard the effect of rotation on the frequency and eigenfunctions for simplicity , hoping that the effect is small because the pulsation periods , @xmath22  min , are very much shorter than the @xmath23-d rotation period of hd  24712 .    previously , theoretical pulsation models based on the method of @xcite were compared with the observed frequencies for @xmath24 equ @xcite , 10 aql @xcite and hd 101065 @xcite .",
    "those attempts were more - or - less successful , although the required strength of the magnetic fields in models tended to be larger than that measured by the zeeman splittings of spectral lines .",
    "in this paper we provide the same modelling of hd  24712 and for the first time we compare not only oscillation frequencies but also the amplitude and phase variations in the atmosphere of hd  24712 .",
    ".unperturbed model parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xcite obtained phase lags of rv variations with respect to the light variations for various spectral lines .",
    "these phase lags are always negative which means that luminosity maximum occurs after the rv maxima . for two other roap stars , 10  aql @xcite and hd  101065 @xcite ,",
    "the observed phase lags are positive , in the range @xmath25 ( 10  aql ) and @xmath26 ( hd  101065 ) , respectively . allowing one cycle for the phase uncertainty , the negative phase lags in hd  24712 may be converted into the positive ones .",
    "table  [ phaselag ] lists some results for the lines formed in the most superficial layers , where optical depth of the formation of each line has been obtained by using a nlte model of @xcite .",
    "generally the phase lag @xmath27 decreases with depth , indicating oscillations propagates outward as discussed below .",
    "table  [ phaselag ] shows that the phase lag around @xmath28 is about @xmath29 , roughly consistent with the theoretical prediction for the main frequency .",
    "@xcite obtained amplitudes and phases of the rv variations in various spectral lines for the two highest amplitude modes ( f4 and f2 ) from time - resolved spectroscopic observations of hd  24712 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the results at a rotational phase of 0.94 ( uves observations close to the magnetic maximum ) .",
    "for a representative sample of , , and  lines , as well as for the core , depths of formation were calculated in nlte approximation @xcite using a model atmosphere from @xcite . in these iterative model calculations",
    "empirical stratifications of the chemical elements si , ca , cr , fe , sr , ba , pr and nd were derived for each iteration .",
    "nlte calculations were performed for pr and nd only , because these elements are concentrated in the uppermost atmospheric layers , while other elements have a tendency to be accumulated close to photosphere where nlte effects may be neglected .",
    "final element distributions were then used for depth of formation calculations .",
    "the results have been converted to the relations between optical depth and rv amplitude / phase . for lines",
    "no stratification analysis was performed , therefore , depth of line formation was calculated with a uniform yttrium distribution using an yttrium abundance @xmath30=8.60 derived from abundance analysis .",
    "figs[fig : tauampd ] and [ fig : tauampd2nd ] compare rv amplitude / phase  @xmath31 relations for f4 and f2 , respectively , with the corresponding theoretical relations of @xmath32 modes for he - depleted best models ( table  [ bestmodels ] ) . for  and",
    "lines with very low rv amplitudes pulsational phases are plotted twice : as defined originally in @xcite , and shifted downward by a pulsation period taking into account the one - period uncertainty in the phase relation .",
    "similar comparisons for models without he - depletion are given in figs[fig : tauamph ] and [ fig : tauamph2nd ] .",
    "in comparing the observed and theoretical relations , the theoretical amplitude is multiplied by an arbitrary factor , and the theoretical phase delay is fitted at the outer boundary ( @xmath33 ) by applying an arbitrary shift .    in the outermost layers oscillation phase gradually delays toward the outer boundary , indicating the presence of running waves propagating outward .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that all the observed oscillation frequencies of hd  24712 are larger than the acoustic cut - off frequencies of theoretical models .",
    "( if a reflective outer boundary condition is imposed , the phase in the outermost layers is nearly constant . )",
    "the gradient of the phase variation in the outermost layers is well reproduced by theoretical relations .",
    "we note that if the @xmath34 term in equation  ( [ eq : edd ] ) is dropped , the gradient becomes steeper , indicating that the @xcite theory is consistent with the observations .",
    "the phase distribution in hd  24712 has a jump between @xmath35 and @xmath36 for both f4 and f2 , indicating the presence of a quasi - node there .",
    "this property agrees with the theoretical phase variations for a - models with the @xmath8 relation having a small temperature inversion at @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ttau ] ) . a rapid phase change in s - models with the standard @xmath8 relation",
    ", however , occurs between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , deeper than the phase jump derived from observations .",
    "thus , the position of the phase jump supports the @xmath8 relation with a temperature inversion at @xmath37 as obtained by @xcite .    whether the phase of theoretical models jump downward or upward depends on the assumption of helium depletion , and sometimes on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "generally , phase tends to decrease inward at the quasi - node in helium - depleted models , and to increase inward in models without helium depletion . in the best model of the ah165 series with @xmath40 kg , the phase of rv variations for the main frequency f4 decreases steeply inward at @xmath41 ,",
    "while it _ increases",
    "_ steeply at the same layer if @xmath42 is slightly increased to @xmath43 kg ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tauamph ] ) , although for the secondary frequency f2 the phase increases steeply inward for both cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tauamph2nd ] ) .",
    "however , such a strong dependence of the direction of the phase jump on @xmath42 does not occur in the other cases .    to obtain information on the helium depletion in the atmosphere of hd  24712 ,",
    "further observations are needed to fill the gap between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    towards deep interior ,",
    "theoretical pulsation phase approaches a constant ; i.e. , nearly a standing wave is realized in the deep atmosphere .",
    "however , the innermost fe ii data for the main pulsation f4 deviate considerably from the theoretical curves .",
    "a possible cause may be related to the surface element distribution ; fe is concentrated around the equator , while y ( as all rare earth elements , including pr and nd ) is concentrated near magnetic poles @xcite .",
    "oscillation amplitude increases rapidly in the outermost layers due to a rapid decrease in the gas density .",
    "in the layers of @xmath46 , theoretical amplitude variations roughly agree with the observed ones for both f4 and f2 . in the outermost layers with @xmath47 , however , theoretical amplitudes deviate significantly from the observations .",
    "observed amplitudes level off in the most superficial layers , the cause of which is not clear ; it could be the effect of nonlinear dissipation , or the density stratification could differ significantly from our simple models .",
    "we discussed theoretical models for the oscillations of the roap star hd  24712 ( hr  1217 ) . observed frequencies are fitted well with theoretical ones for models whose positions on the hr diagram are close to the position of hd  24712 determined by spectroscopy along with the hipparcos parallax .",
    "the observed main frequency f4 is identified as a quasi - quadrupole ( @xmath32 ) mode , whose amplitude on the surface is strongly concentrated in the polar regions and is suppressed significantly around the equator . the theoretical amplitude distribution predicts a rotational modulation of the pulsation amplitude which is consistent with the observations .",
    "we modelled for the first time the distributions of the phase and amplitude of rv variations as a function of atmospheric height and compared these with the observed distributions .",
    "the gradual outward increase of phase lag in the outermost layers is well reproduced by theoretical results obtained with a running - wave outer boundary condition .",
    "the presence of a steep phase change between @xmath48 and @xmath45 favours a @xmath8 relation with a temperature inversion at @xmath49 , rather than a standard @xmath8 relation .",
    "although our models agree with most of the observed properties of the oscillations in the atmosphere of hd  24712 , we have recognized three problems to be solved in the future .    1 .   the observed amplitude of velocity variation levels off in the outermost layers with @xmath50 , while in all the models we have calculated amplitude increases steeply outward in the layers with @xmath51 .",
    "2 .   if the observed main frequencies are identified with @xmath32 and @xmath52 modes , to explain their nearly equal spacings the small frequency spacing defined as @xmath53 $ ] must be as small as @xmath54@xmath55hz .",
    "for all the models calculated , however , the small spacing was always larger than @xmath56@xmath55hz .",
    "the problem goes away if we assume the observed equal spacings of frequencies are produced by @xmath32 and @xmath57 modes rather than @xmath32 and @xmath52 modes .",
    "however , this solution has a problem ; @xmath57 modes have rotational amplitude modulations different from the modulation seen in the light variations of hd  24712 .",
    "we have found no excited oscillation modes with frequencies appropriate for hd  24712 ; in other words all the modes examined are damped ones .",
    "high - order p - modes in roap stars are generally thought to be excited by the @xmath58-mechanism in the hydrogen ionization zone @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath58-mechanism does not seem to be strong enough to excite the super - critical high - order p - modes in hd  24712 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inefficiency of the @xmath58-mechanism is in common with the case of another cool roap star hd 101065 having many regularly spaced frequencies @xcite .",
    "probably we need to find a new excitation mechanism for these coolest roap stars .",
