    "since the discovery of iron - based superconductors in 2008  @xcite , the @xmath13 8 k superconducting @xmath3-fese  @xcite has attracted much interest duo to its simple lattice structure and sharing a common electronic origin for superconducting mechanism with the much complicated iron - arsenide systems  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 of iron - selenide can be raised upto 14.5 k by tellurium partial substitution on selenium site  @xcite . a break through of the iron - selenides system",
    "was achieved by the discovery of superconductors @xmath14 ( a = k , rb , cs or tl , fese-122 )  @xcite for their high @xmath13 32 k and being a direct comparison system in electronic structure with iron - arsenide 122 systems ( feas-122 ) and relative pnictide systems  @xcite . however , the unavoidable nano - scaled coexistence of antiferromagnetic insulated 245-phases ( @xmath15 = 470 - 560",
    "k ) inside the superconducting fese-122 phase interferes the discussions of fundamental superconducting and electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "recently , an exciting development about pure superconductors with @xmath1 up to 46 k were reported for metal intercalated iron - selenides by ammonothermal reaction  @xcite .",
    "the neutron diffraction studies indicated that ammonia molecules were inserted together with lithium atoms in - between the @xmath4-layers in the @xmath1 = 43 k @xmath16 superconductor  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that @xmath1 of the iron - selenides systems increases with an increasing adjacent @xmath4-layers distance  @xcite . on the other hand , structural variations of intra-@xmath4-layer and electron doping as the origin of @xmath1 enhancement after the li and @xmath17 intercalation",
    "is also reported .",
    "@xcite .    in this report",
    ", structural and superconducting properties of @xmath18 ( a = ba or sr ) were studied .",
    "the structural analysis suggested that the intra-@xmath4-layer structure of @xmath0 remains the same as the parent superconducting fese compound .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath1 could be attributed to the more 2d - like electronic structure by shortened brillouin zone z - axis due to inter-@xmath4-layer intercalation .",
    "superconducting parameters , coherence length @xmath19 , penetration depth @xmath20 , and ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath6 extracted from magnetic measurements indicates both systems are typical type - ii superconductors .",
    "furthermore , superfluid density @xmath21 of @xmath0 is found to be well described by a two - gap s - wave model similar to that of the parent compound  @xcite .",
    "high quality powder samples of @xmath18 ( a = ba , sr ) were synthesized by intercalating ba ( or sr ) atoms into tetragonal @xmath3-fese using liquid ammonia ( la )  @xcite .",
    "first , high - purity superconducting @xmath3-fese was prepared by high temperature reactions  @xcite .",
    "iron granules ( 99.98% ) and selenium shots ( 99.999% ) with 1.008:1 molar ratio were placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in a quartz tube .",
    "the tube was slowly heated to 750 @xmath22c and held 1 day for complete reaction , then melted by heating to 1080 @xmath22c followed by quenching to 420 @xmath22c and held for 2 days for pure @xmath3 phase .",
    "the intercalating reaction was carried out by placing @xmath3-fese powder with ba ( 99.7% ) or sr ( 99% ) metal in a 4:1 molar ratio in an evacuated autoclave cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath  @xcite .",
    "gaseous ammonia was slowly condensed into liquid until a ba / sr in la concentration of 0.2 - 0.3 at@xmath23 was reached .",
    "the vessel was kept at room temperature and magnetically stirred for 3 days .",
    "the obtained fine sample powders were then pressed into pellets and encapsulated by epoxy to prevent sample degradation due to ammonia escape .",
    "the lattice structure analysis was carried out by x - ray diffraction with a philips x@xmath24pert diffractometer for 2@xmath25 range of 5 - 60 degree .",
    "the magnetic measurements were carried out by a quantum design mpms2 squid magnetometer with temperature down to 5 k and applied magnetic field up to 1 t.",
    "powder x - ray diffraction patterns of @xmath0 ( upper panel ) and @xmath2(lower panel ) .",
    "the small peaks corresponding to hexagonal @xmath26-fese are labeled by `` h '' , iron oxide by `` @xmath27 '' and unknown phases by asteroids.,width=264 ]    the powder x - ray diffraction patterns of @xmath18 ( a = ba or sr ) , as shown in figure 1 , can be well indexed by body - centered - tetragonal ( bct ) @xmath28-type structure ( space group : i4/mmm )  @xcite .",
    "minor phases of impurities were barely observed for hexagonal fese ( marked by  h \" and iron oxide ( by  @xmath27 \" ) , and unknown phases ( by asteroids ) .",
    "no trace of superconducting precursor @xmath3-fese was observed .",
    "the derived lattice parameters for a = ba are a = 0.3787 nm and c = 1.6885 nm , and for a = sr are a = 0.3834 nm and c = 1.7318 nm .",
    "the greatly elongated c - axes observed are consistent with the literatures and can be attributed to @xmath17 molecules co - intercalation  @xcite .",
    "lager lattice parameters and unit cell volume observed for sr - compound ( v = 0.2542 nm@xmath29 ) than ba - compound ( v = 0.2422 nm@xmath29 ) suggests a higher content of intercalated metal atoms in the former , which is consistent with the preliminary refinement results that the stoichiometric parameter x of @xmath300.25 and @xmath300.4 for a = ba and sr , respectively . however , due to the signal to noise ratio of the xrd data is not conclusive enough , we left the ba / sr content as undetermined in the following discussion .     low apply field ( @xmath31 = 10 g ) diamagnetic mass susceptibility @xmath32 of superconducting @xmath0 and @xmath2 in zero - field - cooled ( zfc , solid symbols ) and field - cooled ( fc , open symbols ) modes . an enhancement of diamagnetism below 14 k is attributed to the opening of smaller superconducting gap in the two - gap scenario .",

    "a relatively large paramagnetic background was observed in the normal state , which could be attributed to the minor magnetic phases observed in xrd patterns .",
    "an enhancement of diamagnetism below 14 k can be clearly observed in @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon is attributed to the opening of second superconducting gap in the weak - coupling two - gap scenario .",
    "similar behaviour was barely seen for sr - compound due to its much larger particle sizes of the powder .    among all intercalated iron - selenides superconductors , the enhancement of @xmath1 to around 40 k",
    "is believed due to the c - axis expansion and carrier density tuning by atoms / molecules intercalation  @xcite .",
    "however , the almost unchanged a - axis length and very low content of inserted ba in @xmath0 suggests that one can consider the @xmath0 as directly separating @xmath4 layers in @xmath35 by the inserted atoms / molecules without changing its intra - layer structure .",
    "this insertion elongates the c - axis length which weakens the inter-@xmath4-layer coupling .",
    "consequently , it shortens the corresponding brillouin zone c*-axis length in the reciprocal space , which makes the fermi surfaces more cylindrical and more two - dimensional - like assuming the band structure is mainly determined by the almost unchanged intra-@xmath4-layer structure  @xcite .",
    "inset of figure 2 shows the higher - field @xmath36 for @xmath0 which were measured right after the 10-g measurement to avoid any sample degradation problems .",
    "the observed @xmath1 determined by the deviation point from the normal state decreases slightly to 37 k for @xmath31 = 1 t. the magnitude of diamagnetic signal decreases rapidly with increasing applied field .",
    "the zfc @xmath36(1 t ) curve even did not change sign down to 5 k due to fine powder grand size of the sample powder and the strong paramagnetic background .",

    "the obtained @xmath38 decreases monotonically with increasing temperature from 28 g for t = 5 k , to 22 g for 20 k , and then to 6 g for 35 k. measurements on @xmath2 also revealed a similar behavior of @xmath38 decreased from @xmath8(10 k ) = 23 g , to @xmath8(20 k ) = 18 g , then to @xmath8(30 k ) = 12 g. the observed low @xmath8 values are comparable to those observed for @xmath39 c - axis in @xmath3-fese  @xcite , despite their much higher @xmath1 s in these intercalated superconductors .     the superconducting @xmath31-t phase diagram of @xmath0 derived from magnetic measurements .",
    "the @xmath8(0 ) @xmath3030 g was obtained by simple extrapolation and the linear fitting of @xmath9(t ) was shown by solid curves .",

    "the irreversible line , @xmath40 , determined from the deviation points of zfc and fc curves is also shown as a boundary between vortex glass and liquid states .",
    "the zero temperature lower critical field @xmath8(0 ) @xmath3030 g was easily obtained by extrapolation .",

    "the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath43 = 102 was derived from these extrapolated @xmath9(0 ) and b@xmath44(0 ) values by solving @xmath9/b@xmath44 = 2@xmath45/ln@xmath6 , which indicates that @xmath0 is a typical type - ii superconductor as expected . since the superconducting coherent length @xmath46 = 4.96 nm can be easily derived by using the formula @xmath9",
    "= @xmath47/2@xmath48 , it is straight forward to calculate the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath49(0 ) = @xmath50(0 ) = 508 nm .",
    "similar analysis was performed on @xmath2 and the obtained critical fields were @xmath9(0 ) = 61.4 t and @xmath8(0 ) = 24 g , by which the superconducting parameters @xmath51 = 266 , @xmath52(0 ) = 2.33 nm , and @xmath53(0 ) = 620 nm were derived .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath54 , proportional to superfluid density , of @xmath0 estimated from low - field magnetic susceptibility .",

    "the london penetration depth @xmath56 was derived by solving the equation    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the susceptibility of perfect diamagnetic spheres and g(r ) is the grand size distribution function , which was obtained by counting sample powder grands under an optical microscope as @xmath59 .",
    "a constant paramagnetic background was subtracted from the susceptibility for completely counting the diamagnetic signal .    since the 10-g applied field became larger than b@xmath44 for temperature higher than @xmath3032 k , the penetration depth @xmath7 values obtained at those temperature were contaminated by vortex formation , thus 1/@xmath55 data for t @xmath60 32 k were excluded for further discussion . at the low temperature side ,",
    "1/@xmath55 for temperature below 15 k apparently deviated from the saturation behaviour of conventional bcs single - gap model . referring to similar systems ,",
    "@xcite two - gap model was used for analysis and consistent results were obtained .",
    "the temperature dependence of the penetration depth of @xmath0 was fitted by a weakly coupled two - gap s - wave model  @xcite    @xmath61    where @xmath20 is the zero temperature penetration depth , @xmath62 is the @xmath63th superconducting gap at t = 0 k and @xmath64 is the weighting factor of the first gap  @xcite .",
    "each component can be expressed within the local london approximation as    @xmath65 = 1 + 2@xmath66    where @xmath67 is the fermi function , and the temperature dependence of the gap is approximated as @xmath68^{0.51}}$ ] .",
    "@xcite the two - gap s - wave model , the brown curve in figure 5 , describes the temperature dependence of penetration depth very well .",
    "the zero temperature gaps values obtained for @xmath0 are @xmath11 = 6.47 mev and @xmath12 = 1.06 mev with @xmath64 = 0.69 .",
    "the derived gap to @xmath1 ratios of @xmath69 = 3.85 and @xmath70 = 0.63 are consistent with those in @xmath71 ( @xmath1 = 40 k )  @xcite and @xmath28 ( @xmath1 = 43 k )  @xcite .",
    "the slightly bigger value for the @xmath69 , comparing with the bcs value of @xmath72 = 3.35 , suggests that the weak - coupling assumption in the two - gap s - wave model used is a good approximation .",
    "since our samples were randomly orientated powder , the influence of temperature variation of @xmath73 should be observed in diamagnetic susceptibility .",
    "however , by taking typical anisotropy of iron - selenide systems and the obtained @xmath20 , the estimated value of @xmath74 is about 2 @xmath75 m which is larger than most ( @xmath30 80@xmath23 ) grain size of the powder .",
    "when the c - axes of the single crystal grains have large angles to the applied magnetic field , magnetic field penetrates into the grains completely even at low temperature which makes the effects of temperature dependence are not observed .",
    "thus the estimated @xmath20 value of @xmath30506 nm could be regarded as the upper bound of @xmath76 and the temperature dependence of 1/@xmath55 represents the supercurrent behaviour in the @xmath4-layer .    in conclusion ,",
    "superconducting properties of @xmath18 ( a = ba or sr ) were studied by magnetic measurements .",
    "the high @xmath1 after alkali - metal and ammonia molecule intercalation is due to a 3d - like to 2d - like fermi surface change .",
    "temperature dependence of the london penetration depth was derived from diamagnetic susceptibility for @xmath0 which is well described by a two - gap s - wave model with gap values @xmath11 = 6.47 mev and @xmath12 = 1.06 mev and @xmath77 506 nm .",
