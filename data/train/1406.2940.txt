    "thermoelectric phenomena , in which heat is converted to electric power and viceversa , have long been the subject of intense research activity . in recent years",
    ", theoretical interest in these phenomena has reached new heights , due to their implications for the development of sustainable energy sources  @xcite .",
    "understanding thermoelectric phenomena in semiconductors is also extremely important to try and reduce heat losses in electronic circuits . in this respect graphene ,",
    "a monolayer of carbon atoms packed in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice  @xcite , is a potentially important material  @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown  @xcite that the thermal conductivity of pristine suspended graphene ( due to phonons ) has an extremely high value , as compared with other semiconductors .",
    "such a large thermal conductivity may be beneficial for electronic applications and thermal management  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we focus on the thermal current , precisely defined as the temperature @xmath4 times the entropy current carried by a high - mobility electron gas in a layer of doped graphene .",
    "it is well known that the electronic thermal ( @xmath5 ) and charge ( @xmath6 ) d.c .",
    "conductivities of such a gas are connected by the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law  @xcite , which states that @xmath7 where the quantity on the right hand side  the so - called  lorenz number \"  is a universal constant , independent of material parameters .",
    "this elegant statement reflects the fact that a single set of carriers ( electrons ) transport both the charge and the thermal energy , and that the scattering mechanism ( mainly electron - impurity scattering at low temperature ) affects in the same way both thermal and charge conductivities .",
    "the standard derivation of the wf law  @xcite ignores electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions , which can , in principle , change the value of the wf ratio by affecting the charge and thermal conductivities in different ways .",
    "let us write these conductivities , at a finite frequency @xmath8 , in the common form @xmath9 where @xmath10 for the charge conductivity , @xmath11 for the thermal conductivity , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the relaxation times of charge and thermal currents respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding  drude weights \" .",
    "electron - electron interactions can modify the wf ratio by ( i ) creating a difference between the relaxation times @xmath14 and @xmath15 and/or ( ii ) creating a difference between the drude weights .",
    "in general , the  amended \" wf relation follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_drude_conductivity ] ) , and reads [ wfratio ] =  .",
    "previous calculations of the wf ratio of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the presence of e - e interactions  @xcite had focused on the diffusive regime , in which @xmath15 and @xmath14 are nearly identical and controlled by the electron - impurity scattering time @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the renormalization factor @xmath19 is approximately @xmath20 .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the renormalization of the drude weights appeared to be absent  @xcite ( see , however , footnote  @xcite below ) , led to the conclusion that the wf law remains valid in the presence of e - e interactions .    in this letter",
    "we consider a different (  hydrodynamic \" ) regime , which is expected to be relevant in very clean electronic systems , such as doped graphene , with slowly varying potential modulations at not too low temperature . in this regime ,",
    "the e - e scattering time is much shorter than the electron impurity or electron - phonon scattering times  @xcite .",
    "then a large difference can appear between the charge current and the thermal current relaxation times , with the former being much larger than the latter .",
    "this happens because e - e interactions do not contribute to charge current relaxation .",
    "indeed , in each e - e scattering event the total momentum and hence the total charge current is conserved if umklapp processes are neglected .",
    "interband processes , potentially important in doped graphene , can be shown not to affect the charge conductivity in the fermi liquid regime  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the thermal current is not conserved in an e - e scattering process .",
    "therefore , contrary to the charge case , the thermal relaxation rate has a contribution from e - e interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 . below",
    "we prove that @xmath22 , at variance with @xmath23 , remains finite in the clean limit and equals @xmath3 of the quasiparticle decay rate .",
    "since the latter is always finite at finite temperature , we conclude that the wf ratio , renormalized by @xmath24 , can become arbitrarily small in the clean limit ( @xmath25 ) .    as for the second effect mentioned above , namely the different renormalization of the charge and thermal drude weights",
    ", we will show that while the charge drude weight is affected by self - energy corrections  @xcite ( reflected in a renormalized fermi velocity ) _ and _ by vertex corrections ( described by the landau fermi liquid parameter @xmath26  @xcite ) , the thermal drude weight is affected only by self - energy corrections .",
    "this leads to a further renormalization @xmath27 of the wf ratio , which however is expected to be a small correction  @xcite .",
    "we note that a hydrodynamic theory of the thermoelectric transport in graphene was worked out in refs .",
    "there it was also shown that the thermal conductivity is finite in the presence of e - e interactions .",
    "however , no explicit form of the thermal transport time and drude weight was given .",
    "the present work is clearly within the framework of the landau theory of fermi liquids .",
    "mode - coupling effects  @xcite that could lead to a scale dependence of the electronic thermal conductivity  such as the logarithmic dependence on system size observed for the thermal conductivity from phonons in pristine graphene  @xcite  are beyond the reach of such a theory .",
    "electrons and holes in doped graphene are described by the massless - dirac - fermion ( mdf ) hamiltonian ( per spin and valley flavor  hereafter @xmath28 )  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) destroys ( creates ) a particle with momentum @xmath32 in band @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the band energy .",

    "( [ eq : sm_chi_hh_final ] ) implies that , contrary to the charge drude weight , the thermal drude weight contains only self - energy contributions and no vertex correction .",
    "this confirms the result we found with the landau s phenomenological theory of normal fermi liquids , namely that the thermal drude weight is proportional to the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath76 , while the charge drude weight is proportional to the product @xmath77 .",

    "@xcite claimed that the thermal drude weight is similarly un - renormalized .",
