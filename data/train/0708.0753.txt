    "it has long been known that the kinematics of spiral galaxies do not show keplerian fall - off in their rotation curves , but rather imply the presence of an invisible mass component in addition to the stellar and gaseous disks @xcite . in the local universe , observing the distribution of star light and mapping the gaseous component through hi it has been possible to build up a picture of the how the baryonic component of disk galaxies is distributed and how this relates to the underlying dark matter component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "tracing the evolution of galaxy mass from high - redshift up to the present day is only truly reliable if we can observe the same components at early times .",
    "a pioneering study was performed by @xcite where a handful of rotation curves ( rc s ) of objects at @xmath2 was obtained using traditional longslit spectroscopy on the 10 meter keck telescope . however , at higher redshifts ( e.g. z@xmath31 ) galaxies are much fainter and have smaller angular disk scale lengths than galaxies observed at low redshift , therefore obtaining the spatial information required for detailed studies is beyond the limits of current technology .",
    "indeed , mapping the internal properties and dynamics of both the stellar and gaseous components of galaxies at high redshift is one of the main science drivers for the next generation of ground and spaced based telescopes at many wavelengths ( e.g. elt , ngst , alma ) .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to use the natural amplification caused by gravitational lensing to boost the size and flux of distant galaxies which serendipitously lie behind massive galaxy clusters .",
    "this technique is extremely useful since we are able to target galaxies which would otherwise be too small and faint to ensure a sufficiently high signal - to - noise spectroscopy in conventional observations . as such",
    ", gravitational lensing has been extensively used to make detailed studies of distant galaxies : for a galaxy at @xmath4=1 with an amplification factor ten , an angular scale of 0.6@xmath5 can correspond to @xmath60.5kpc , sufficient to map also a small spiral .",
    "the benefits of gravitational lensing are complemented by integral field spectroscopy ( which produces a contiguous _ two dimensional velocity _ map at each point in the target galaxy ) .",
    "this allows a clean decoupling of the spatial and spectral information , thus eliminating the problems arising from their mixing in traditional long - slit observations .",
    "it is therefore much easier to identify and study galaxies with regular ( bi - symmetric ) velocity fields .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed study of four rotation curves extracted from disk galaxies which have been observed through the cores of massive galaxy cluster lenses .",
    "these targets are taken from the recent work of @xcite .",
    "they were observed with the gemini - north multi - object spectrograph integral field unit ( gmos ifu ) .",
    "we concentrate on the galaxy dynamics as traced by the [ oii]@xmath73726.1,3728.8  emission line doublet .",
    "the ifu data provide a map of the galaxy s velocity field in sky co - ordinates . to interpret this field",
    "the magnification and distortion caused by the gravitational lensing effect is removed using detailed models of the cluster lenses ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "the primary constraints on the lens models are the positions and redshifts of spectroscopically confirmed gravitational arcs in each cluster .",
    "the source plane velocity fields of four systems which display regular ( bi - symmetric ) rotational velocity fields i.e.  resembling rotating disks , were reduced to one - dimensional rotation curves from which the asymptotic terminal velocity was extracted and compared with the galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of using gravitational lensing to boost the images of distant galaxies is that we are less biases towards the most luminous galaxies .",
    "whilst observational information on the distribution of the hi disks in galaxies at these early times would be wellcome , such observations will have to wait for future instrumentation ( e.g. alma ) .",
    "in this paper we use nebular emission lines to probe the kinematic of the galaxies .",
    "we extract one - dimensional rotation curves from the velocity fields to infer the distribution of stellar and dark matter components .",
    "finally , we compare our results with similarly luminous disk galaxies in the local universe . through - out",
    "this paper we use a cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "our sample comes from observations of six gravitational arcs in @xcite . in order to avoid possible biases ,",
    "the targets were selected only to be representative of galaxies in the distant universe and no attempt was made to select galaxies with relaxed late - type morphology .",
    "we did , however , require that arcs were resolved in both spatial dimensions so that a two dimensional velocity field could be extracted from the ifu data .",
    "this restricted our selection to galaxies with moderate magnification . from the sample of six galaxies ,",
    "four galaxies appear to have ( relaxed ) bi - symmetric velocity fields with late - type morphologies and colours .",
    "the rotation curves from these four galaxies appear regular and we therefore restrict our analysis to these arcs . we stress that the morphology , colours and velocity fields of the four galaxies in this sample all strongly suggest these galaxies are consistent with late type spirals ( see @xcite ) .      from our optical / near - infrared imaging , we constrain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each galaxy .",
    "since the arcs usually lie with a few arcs - seconds of nearby bright cluster galaxies , we calculate the magnitude of the arcs in various pass - bands by masking the arc and interpolating the light from the nearby cluster members .",
    "the background light is then removed and surface photometry in different bands is obtained .    using the cluster mass models the arcs",
    "are reconstructed to the source - plane and the geometry and disk - scale parameters of the disks are measured .",
    "this is achieved by fitting ellipses to an isophote of the galaxy image using a modified version of the idl gauss2dfit routine which fits an exponential profile to the two - dimensional light distribution . from this , the ellipticity , the inclination and luminosities and the disk scale lengths are obtained ( see table 2 and 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "these latter are also reported below in table 1 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_curves ] we show the one dimensional rotation curves of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "these are extracted by sampling the velocity field along the major axis cross section . the zero - point in the velocity",
    "is defined using the center of the galaxy in the reconstructed source plane image .",
    "the error bars for the velocities are derived from the formal @xmath12 uncertainty in the velocity arising from gaussian profile fits to the [ oii ] emission in each averaged pixel of the datacube . for the mass modelling analysis we folded the rotation curves on the kinematical center to ensure that any small - scale kinematical sub - structure is removed",
    "the rotation curves of local spiral galaxies imply the presence of an invisible mass component , in addition to the stellar and gaseous disks .",
    "the paradigm is that the circular velocity field can be characterized by : @xmath13 where the subscripts denote the stellar disk , dark halo and gaseous disk respectively . from the photometry we model the stellar component with a freeman surface density @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the disk lenght - scale ,",
    "while @xmath16 can be taken as the `` size '' af the stellar disk , whose contribution to the circular velocity is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the modified bessel functions computed at @xmath21 . in small spirals",
    "the hi disk is an important baryonic component only for @xmath22 , i.e. outside the region considered here .",
    "it is plausible that in similar objects also at high redshifts , _ inside _ @xmath23 , the h i gas contributes to the gravitating baryonic mass by a very small amount , residing at larger radii and it slowly infalls forming the stellar disk .    for the dark matter component we take a spherical halo for which @xmath24 .",
    "following the observational scenario constructed in the local universe @xcite we assume that it has the @xcite density profile ( see also salucci et al 2007 ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the core radius and @xmath27 the effective core density .",
    "it follows that : @xmath28~\\eqno(5)\\ ] ] with @xmath29 and of course @xmath30 we note that the adopted velocity profile is a quite general : it allows a distribution with a core of size @xmath26 , converges to the nfw profile at large distances and , for suitable values of @xmath26 can also mimic the nfw or a isothermal profile , over the limited region of galaxy which is mapped by the rotation curves .",
    "the mass model has three free parameters : the disk mass @xmath31 , the core radius @xmath26 , and the central core density @xmath27 .",
    "the observations extend out approximately @xmath32 , have 10 - 60 independent measurements with an observational error of @xmath33 in their amplitude , of 0.05 - 0.2 in their slopes @xmath34 .",
    "the error in the estimate of the disk inclination angles is negligible with respect to the above .",
    "these errors are ( understandably ) higher than those associated with the best quality local rc s and make it difficult to constrain the halo density profile @xmath35 . however , they are sufficiently small to yield a reliable value for the halo mass , the average density inside a reference radius , ( which we chose to be @xmath36 so that @xmath37 and the disk mass and a reasonable estimate of the `` core radius '' .    by reproducing the observed rotation curves with the models given by equations 1 - 5",
    "we derive the best fit parameters for each galaxy and overlay the resulting mass model onto each rotation curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_curves ] . in table 1",
    "we report the main structural parameters : the disk mass , the halo core radius , @xmath27 , the optical radius @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. the halo contribution to circular velocity at the optical radius .    in all",
    "our rotation curves the _ amplitude _ and the _ profile _ of the stellar disk contribution can not reproduce the observed rc rise between 1.5 @xmath40 and the last measured radius .",
    "this strongly suggests evidence for the presence , at @xmath41 , of a dark matter component of mass comparable to that found for local disk galaxies with similar @xmath42 ( see figures 2 , 8 and 9 of persic , salucci & stel , 1996 ) .",
    "we derive disk masses ranging between @xmath43 to @xmath44 for galaxies with reference velocity @xmath42 between 100@xmath45 and 200@xmath45 .",
    "these disk masses are smaller by a factor 2 - 4 than those of the local spirals with the same reference velocity which are shown to follow inner baryon dominance ( see salucci & persic , 1999 ) .",
    "the high redshift stellar disks are sub - maximal disks .",
    "forcing a maximal disk even in the `` weak '' implementation of persic and salucci ( 1990 ) leads to unacceptable fits of our high - z rc s .",
    "the best fit values for @xmath26 is of the order of @xmath46 , which is larger than usually compatible with a nfw profile , although the error - bars on our data preclude any strong statement .",
    "since the gravitational lens model affects the source - plane reconstruction of the galaxies , we must test for the effect that this has on the resulting rotation curves .",
    "we reconstruct the galaxies using the family of lens models that inhabit the @xmath47 contour corresponding to @xmath48 confidence interval relevant to each cluster .",
    "for example , the model of rgb1745 has five free parameters , and the lens modeling uncertainties are therefore derived by considering models within the @xmath49 contour . from each reconstruction",
    "we extract the one - dimensional rotation curve and apply the analysis outlined above and find the maximum variations are : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "thus the uncertainties in the gravitational lens modelling is negligable compared to the uncertainties in the rc mass modelling .",
    "a cosmological significance of our result is evident in fig  [ fig : md_rhom ] where we compare the disk mass , the mean dark matter density within the optical radius and the angular momentum per unit mass , all as a function of reference velocity .",
    "these are compared to similar properties of the local objects @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : md_rhom ] strikingly shows that high redshift spirals , modulo an offset of @xmath53 dex , are on the same @xmath54 versus @xmath55 relationship found for local spirals arising from the systematic structural properties of their mass distribution @xcite , see also @xcite .    in fig 2 , from the values of @xmath56 , a quantity that differently from @xmath27 is weakly affected by the rc 1-@xmath57 fitting uncertainties , it is apparent that the dm halos of @xmath0 disk galaxies are denser by @xmath58 dex than those around similarly luminous @xmath4=0 spirals .",
    "the evidence that spiral disks at @xmath4=0 and @xmath4=1 have the same structural relationships is further supported by observations of the evolution of the tully - fisher relation ( which correlates the disk mass with @xmath42 ) . in our and in other independent samples ( swinbank et al 2006 , , vogt et al 1996 , bamford et al 2005 ) the galaxies at @xmath0 show a tf relation with a slope similar to that of the local tf , but with an offset compatible with that found in the present work from the disk mass _ vs _ rotation velocity .",
    "this suggests that from @xmath4=1 to @xmath4=0 , the stellar disk masses @xmath59 of a spiral has grown by a factor @xmath60 , that leads to just a modest increase in the dm dominated quantity @xmath42 .",
    "further evidence that @xmath0 disk galaxies are related to present day spirals is provided by the relationship between angular momentum per unit mass ( @xmath61 ) versus the reference velocity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : md_rhom ] . this well theoretically motivated relation ( e.g. @xcite ) can be considered as the imprint of the process of the formation of disks inside dark matter halos related to the cosmological properties of halo spin parameters .",
    "as figure  [ fig : md_rhom ] shows , there appears to be no evolution in this crucial relationship between the the comological time at which we observe these spirals , @xmath62 and the present time , @xmath63 .",
    "this agreement is remarkable : it establishes a link between local and high redshift disks , supporting the idea that the angular momentum remains constant during the evolution of a disk system from high redshift to the present day .",
    "the kinematical estimate of the disk mass allows us to derive the mass - to - light ratios for our disk systems as a function of luminosity and colour . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the disk mass and colour as a function of mass - to - light ratio compared to the relation in local spirals @xcite . in order to compare directly with local relations",
    ", we consider a simple passive evolution model for the luminosity evolution . for a single stellar population the zero - point of the local relation",
    "is decreaed by a factor @xmath64 which accounts for the passive evolution of a _ single _ stellar population from @xmath0 to @xmath65 . as fig .",
    "3 shows the mass - to - light ratios as a function of galaxy ( @xmath66 ) colour are in broad agreement with predictions of a single stellar population which is @xmath67 old @xcite , although clearly photometry at other wavelengths ( such as rest - frame k - band ) would allow a more detailed decomposition of the stellar popultations in these galxies .",
    "figure  2 shows that at a radius corresponding to @xmath42 the high redshift galaxies are significantly denser than comparably luminous local disk - galaxies : the average offset is about 0.6 dex in @xmath68 . although we can not exclude that dynamical processes occur between @xmath0 and @xmath65 to reduce the dark - matter density in the luminous regions , this offset is naturally explained if the halos embedding these disk galaxies formed at earlier times than the halos around similarly massive @xmath65 spirals . in this framework",
    "we estimate the ratio between the virialization redshift of the local galaxies and and that of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "since @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are average density and redshift at virialization and @xmath72 is known , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , which corresponds to @xmath75 .    assuming that our sample is a fair representation of disk galaxies at @xmath76 and that these are approximately coeval , from the comparison of their structural properties with those of @xmath65 spirals , the following simple picture emerges : a present day spiral , with a given circular velocity , half - light radius and the angular momentum per unit mass , at redshift @xmath77 had similar values for these quantities , but a smaller stellar mass : @xmath78 . this induces a scale for the average sfr in the past 8 gyr : @xmath79 . with these disks having an average age of 1gyr at @xmath0",
    "we can also derive an `` early times '' average sfr @xmath80 which points towards a declining sfr history .",
    "the marked increase of the luminosity per unit stellar mass in objects at high redshifts with respect to their local counterparts has the simplest explanation in a passive evolution of the starforming disks .",
    "obviously , this simple picture requires us to assume that the high redshift systems are the direct counter - parts of similar rotation speed spirals at low redshift .",
    "in this study , we have investigated the detailed properties of four disk galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "these galaxies were observed at high spatial resolution thanks to the boost in angular size provided by gravitational lensing by foreground massive galaxy clusters and allow a much more detailed comparison with local populations than usually possible for galaxies at these early times . modelling the one - dimensional rotation curves with those of @xcite we derive",
    "best fit parameters for the total dynamical mass , the core radius , the effective core density and the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "the best fit model rotation curves to the data show that the amplitude and profile of the stellar disk componentcan not unambiguously reproduce the rise in the rotation curve without a dark matter component . comparing the average dark matter density inside the optical radius",
    "we find that the disk galaxies at @xmath0 have larger densities ( by up to a factor of @xmath1 ) than similar disk galaxies in the local universe . in comparison , we find that the angular momentum per unit mass versus reference velocity is well matched to the local relation suggesting that the angular momentum of the disk remains constant between high redshift and the present day .",
    "though statistically limited , these observations point towards a spirals formation scenario in which stellar disk are slowly grown by the accretion of angular momentum conserving material .",
    "our result , also consistent with the theoretical evolution of the angular momentum of disks from semi - analytic models from @xmath4=1 to @xmath4=0 which show the modest offset of @xmath81j@xmath60.2 kpc.@xmath45 for objects with circular velocities between 50 and 300@xmath45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these reults provide an evolutionary link between the disk systems we observe at redshift @xmath821 and the present day population of spirals .",
    "while these results are based on data of only four objects , they nevertheless show the power which gravitational lensing can have on studying the internal properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "in particular , these observations should be viewed as pathfinder science which will soon be routine with adaptive optics integral field unit observations on eight and ten meter telescopes ( e.g. @xcite ) . moreover , by combining these results with upcoming telescopes and instruments ( e.g. alma ) which will be sensitive enough to map the hi content of galaxies to @xmath0 , the exact relation between gas , stars and dark matter can be probed in much more detail .",
