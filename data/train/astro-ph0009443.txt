    "quasars have been used as efficient probes of high - redshift clustering because they are known to favour rich environments .",
    "quasars may also trace large - scale structures at early epochs ( @xmath5 ) in the form of large quasar groups ( lqgs ) , which have comparable sizes to the largest structures at the present epoch .",
    "the largest of these is the clowes - campusano lqg of 18 quasars at @xmath6 , with a maximal extent of 200@xmath7mpc ( clowes & campusano 1991 ) .    to examine the galaxy environment of quasars in this lqg ,",
    "we have conducted an ultra - deep optical ( to @xmath8 ) study of a @xmath9 field containing 3 quasars from this lqg , with additional @xmath10 imaging obtained for subfields around 2 of them .",
    "any associated passively - evolving galaxies can be identified from their extremely - red optical - ir colours ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we find a 3.5@xmath12 excess of @xmath13 galaxies in the @xmath14 field centred on the z=1.226 lqg quasar 104420.8 + 055739 ( haines et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this excess is due entirely to a factor @xmath1511 overdensity of @xmath2 galaxies , which must have @xmath16 to explain their colour .",
    "we observe clear red sequences at and @xmath17 ( figure 1 ) , comparable to red sequences observed in other @xmath18 clusters , and indicating a population of 1518 passively - evolving massive ellipticals at the quasar redshift .",
    "we have produced a density map ( figure 2 ) of galaxies with the same optical colours and magnitudes as the red sequence galaxies to estimate the full extent of any associated clustering beyond the @xmath10 image ( shown as box ) .",
    "there is clearly significant substructure , with the quasar located between two groups of red sequence galaxies and further clustering can be seen extending over the whole structure is suggestive of being a cluster in the early stages of formation through the coalescence of subclusters .",
    "the quasar is located within a concentration of blue ( @xmath4 ) galaxies , with @xmath19 clearly at @xmath20 , having @xmath21 , indicating a region of enhanced star - formation , similar to those found around several @xmath22 lqg quasars ( hutchings , crampton & johnson 1995 ) .",
    "the concentration appears extended to form a _ band _ which bisects the two groups of red sequence galaxies .",
    "we propose that this band of recent star - formation , and the quasar itself , have been triggered by the merging of the two groups , as the galaxies interact with the colliding icms .",
    "the two other lqg quasars are in poor environments , although a background @xmath23 quasar lies on a cluster periphery .",
    "quasars at these redshifts ( @xmath24 ) are found either on the peripheries of clusters ( see also sanchz & gonzlez - serrano 1999 ) or in relatively undistinguished environments .",
