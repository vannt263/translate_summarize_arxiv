    "the recent experimental observation of dirac semimetals @xcite raises the prospects for the observation of weyl semimetals as well .",
    "because of the chiral symmetry in the weyl equation , weyl points can not be eliminated by perturbations as long as the translation symmetry is preserved , realizing a topological phase of matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , nontrivial topological properties of the weyl nodes are related to the fact that they are monopoles of a berry flux in the brillouin zone .",
    "it was shown already a long time ago by nielsen and ninomiya @xcite that weyl nodes in crystals occur only in pairs of opposite chirality .",
    "therefore , the simplest way to eliminate a pair of weyl nodes is to decrease the separation between them in the momentum space transforming the weyl nodes into a dirac point when they meet .",

    "the topological nature of weyl nodes leads to the surface fermi arc states @xcite that connect weyl nodes of opposite chirality .",

    "the two fermi arc states on opposite surfaces form a closed fermi surface .",
    "the electron - electron interactions are important in weyl semimetals and may lead to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking with the gap generation due to the pairing of electrons and holes from weyl nodes of opposite chirality @xcite .",

    "the weyl nodes are separated in momentum space by a dynamically generated chiral shift @xmath2 directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the momentum space separation between the weyl nodes is determined by the quasiparticle charge density , the strength of the magnetic field , and the strength of the interaction .",

    "it should be emphasized that , in the context of our study , one should distinguish the following two types of interaction effects : ( i ) those that exist even in the absence of the magnetic field , ( ii ) those that are triggered by the field . while the chiral shift is already renormalized by interaction in the absence of the magnetic field @xcite , we will concentrate exclusively on the effects intimately connected with the presence of both the magnetic field and the interaction .    clearly , the chiral shift , separating the weyl nodes in the momentum space , is a parameter which defines a weyl semimetal .",

    "although the surface states of weyl semimetals consist of disjoint fermi arcs , it was shown that there exist closed magnetic orbits involving the surface fermi arcs .",

    "this is implemented simply by adding the following mass term to the hamiltonian outside the semimetal : @xmath34 then , the formal description of the system in the whole space can be captured by a single hamiltonian , provided that the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath35 since @xmath33 is much larger than quasiparticle energies in weyl semimetals ( including the work function ) , the results obtained with finite @xmath33 practically can not be distinguished from those found in the infinite mass limit @xmath36 .",
