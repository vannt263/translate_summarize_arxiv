    "the existence of exotic states beyond the constituent quark model ( cqm ) has been speculated about almost since the introduction of colour  @xcite . due to the self - coupling of gluons via colour - charge ,",
    "so - called hybrid mesons and glueball are allowed within quantum chromodynamics while they are beyond the cqm .",
    "hybrid mesons are @xmath4 states with an admixture of gluons , and glueballs are states with no quark content , only consisting of ( constituent ) gluons . according to lattice - qcd predictions @xcite , the glueball candidate lowest in mass has scalar quantum numbers , @xmath5 , and is expected to have a mass of @xmath6 .",
    "a glueball candidate has been observed by the crystal barrel and the wa102 experiments , however , mixing with ordinary isoscalar mesons makes the interpretation difficult .",
    "several light hybrids , on the other hand , are predicted to have exotic @xmath0 quantum numbers and are thus promising candidates in the search for physics beyond the cqm .",
    "the lowest mass hybrid candidate for example is predicted  @xcite to have exotic quantum numbers of spin , parity and charge conjugation @xmath7 not attainable by ordinary @xmath4 states , and a mass between 1.3 and 2.2gev / c@xmath8 .",
    "two experimentally observed @xmath9 hybrid candidates in the light - quark sector have been reported in the past in different decay channels , the @xmath10 mainly seen in @xmath11 decays , by e.g. e852  @xcite , ves@xcite , and crystal barrel  @xcite , and the @xmath3 , observed by both e852 and ves in the decay channels : @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite , and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "in particular the resonant nature of the @xmath12 decay channel of the @xmath3 observed in @xmath16 final states is highly disputed  @xcite .",
    "compass has started to shed new light on the puzzle of spin - exotics by the observation of an @xmath9 signal in the 2004 data , consistent with the famous @xmath3 .",
    "it shows clean phase motions with respect to other waves , confirming the resonance nature  @xcite .",
    "the compass two - stage spectrometer  @xcite at the cern sps features electromagnetic calorimetry in both stages .",
    "photon detection in a wide angular range at high resolution is crucial for decay channels involving @xmath17 , @xmath2 or @xmath18 ,    the ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector in the first stage allows for final state particle identification ( pid ) .",
    "a good separation of pions from kaons enables the study of kaonic final states .",
    "two cherenkov differential counters with acromatic ring focus ( cedar ) upstream of the target are used to identify the incoming beam particle .",
    "not only production of strangeness with the pion beam can thus be studied but also kaon diffraction , tagging the kaon contribution in the negative hadron beam ( 96% @xmath19 , 3.5% @xmath20 , 0.5% @xmath21 ) . after a short pilot run in 2004 of 190",
    "gev / c @xmath19 beam on a lead target ( sec.[subsec.2004 ] ) , compass recorded data with 190gev / c hadron beams in 2008/09 , providing excellent opportunity for simultaneous observation of new states in various decay modes within the same experiment ( sec.[subsec.2008 ] , [ subsec.2008b ] ) .",
    "moreover , the data contain subsets with different beam projectiles ( @xmath22 ) and targets ( h@xmath23 , ni , w , and pb ) , allowing for systematic studies not only of diffractive and central production but also primakoff reactions  @xcite and baryon spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers spin @xmath25 , parity @xmath26 and @xmath27-parity of the produced resonance @xmath28 , together with the spin projection given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( reflectivity ) , define a partial wave @xmath31l$ ] . the partial wave analysis ( pwa )",
    "is based on the isobar model , see fig.[fig : diffrprod_spectro ] _ ( right)_. the resonance @xmath28 decays via an intermediate di - pion resonance ( the isobar ) , accompanied by a so - called bachelor pion .",
    "the pwa method consists of two steps .",
    "first , a mass - independent fit is performed on the data binned into 40mev / c@xmath8 wide mass intervals , no assumption on the resonance structure of the @xmath16 system is made at this level .",
    "a total set of 42 waves including a flat background wave is fitted to the data using an extended maximum likelihood method , which comprises acceptance corrections .",
    "subsequently , the mass - dependent fit is applied to the six main waves out of the result from the first step , and uses a @xmath32 minimisation .",
    "the mass dependence is parameterised by relativistic breit - wigners ( bw ) and coherent background , if present .",
    "the employed parameterisation of the spin density matrix has a rank of two , accounting for spin - flip and spin - non - flip amplitudes at the baryon vertex .",
    "fig.[fig : pwa2004 ] shows the intensity of the @xmath33 wave with the well - established @xmath34 and that of the spin - exotic @xmath9 wave as well as the phase difference @xmath35 between the two , for the fits of all six waves , see @xcite .",
    "the black data points represent the mass - independent fit , whereas the mass - independent one is overlayed as solid line , the separation into background ( dotted ) and bw ( dashed ) is plotted where applicable .",
    "especially the resonant nature of the exotic @xmath36 p$ ] wave is questioned in previous observations , whereas our data shows a clear and rapid phase motion .",
    "our result of a mass of @xmath37mev / c@xmath8 and a width of @xmath38mev / c@xmath8 is consistent with the famous @xmath3  @xcite already reported in the past but still controversially discussed .",
    "an important cross - check of all analyses is the test for isospin symmetry in the observed spectra .",
    "the @xmath12 decay channel of the @xmath3 for example , can be studied in two modes of 3@xmath39 final states , @xmath40 ( charged ) and @xmath41 ( neutral ) , respectively .",
    "the relative contribution should follow isospin conservation , depending on the underlying isobars , as it is shown in fig.[fig : pwa2008 ] . a first partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) of main waves in diffractively produced 3@xmath39 events",
    "has been performed for both modes , applying the same model as for the 2004 result , for details see  @xcite . the wave intensities shown are normalised in the same way to the well - known @xmath12 decay of the @xmath42 to compensate for the different statistics analysed , thus making them comparable .",
    "we find similar intensities for the @xmath12 decay , whereas a suppression factor of two is observed for the wave decaying into @xmath43 as expected due to the clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "further ongoing analyses of neutral channels cover @xmath44 and @xmath45 final states ( search for the @xmath10 and lightest @xmath46 glueball candidate ) as well as @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 final states ( accessible isobars : @xmath50 ) .",
    "for all these channels , compass has recorded significantly higher statistics with respect to previous experiments , covering all spin - exotic meson decay channels in the light quark sector reported in the past .",
    "final states including strange particles are interesting for both , glueball search in central production as well as diffractively produced hybrids .",
    "fig.[fig : kaons ] shows the @xmath51 subsystems out of the @xmath52 system , again for two different modes : @xmath53 ( charged mode ) and @xmath54 ( neutral mode ) final states , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the spectra show a clear structure around the expected @xmath55 .",
    "the cedars were used to anti - tag the kaons in the beam , and the final state kaons are identified using the rich detector and the well resolved @xmath56 secondary vertex , respectively ; for details on the event selections , see  @xcite .",
    "further ongoing analyses of kaonic final states cover the complementary @xmath57 system diffractively produced with the @xmath19 beam as well as kaon diffraction into @xmath58 final states using the beam kaons . in both cases ,",
    "the rich detector is used for final state pid and the cedars for identifying the beam particle .",
    "fig.[fig : kaons_b ] shows mass spectra for the study of kaon diffraction into @xmath58 final states . the total mass spectrum and the @xmath59 show the prominent , well - known resonances as expected , similar as observed by wa03 .",
    "our statistics collected in merely 2008 exceeds the one from wa03 by a factor of two , for details , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the pwa of all kaonic final states mentioned in this paper are under preparation .",
    "compass has taken data with high - intensity , negatively as well as positively charged hadron beams ( @xmath22 ) on nuclear and liquid hydrogen targets .",
    "the data sample newly taken in 2008/09 exceeds the world data by a factor of 10 - 100 , depending on the given final state .",
    "the compass data sets allow to address open issues in light - mesons spectroscopy at good accuracy , even extending the region to higher masses beyond 2gev / c@xmath8 .",
    "this work is supported by the bmbf ( germany ) , particularly the `` nutzungsinitiative cern '' .",
