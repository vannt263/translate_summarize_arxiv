    "innovation  @xcite appears to be an ubiquitary concept , which applies to a variety of contexts , including economy , physics , sociology , ethology , biology , linguistics , and so on  @xcite .",
    "a typical setting able to support innovation includes a component , as a research group , whose specific goal is to produce a breakthrough which in turn is a precondition to find out new technologies , services , and even forms of art  @xcite . as such , the capability of producing innovation becomes also an indicator of the wellness of a society  @xcite . on the other hand , in its pure form",
    ", innovation is in fact an unexpected outcome , most likely due to random guessing , lateral thinking or serendipity .",
    "the most prominent examples of this kind of mechanism can be found in science , where innovation is fundamental for promoting groundbreaking intuitions  @xcite . in this context innovation",
    "is motivated by the goal of dealing with unsolved problems and sometimes carries out , as side - effect , the emergence of new research fields .",
    "a relevant and recent example is constituted by the modern and vibrant field of complex networks  @xcite , that is deeply affecting several scientific sectors just to cite few , social networks  @xcite , epidemiology  @xcite , genomics  @xcite , neuroscience  @xcite , financial systems  @xcite , and many others . here",
    ", scientometrics  @xcite aims is to understand the emergence and the evolution of scientific collaborations , and the metrics to measure related results .",
    "it is worth pointing out that innovation is not specifically tied to human activities , as  by design  all biological systems are able to support it . in biology",
    ", innovation pertains to it from both structural and behavioral perspectives . in the former case",
    ", one may observe ( or infer ) the emergence of new gene sequences in living organisms able to improve their fitness . in the latter case",
    ", specific studies concerning animal behavior pointed out that also animals are able to come up with innovative solutions  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , also evolutionary computation ( in particular , genetic algorithms  @xcite ) , strongly emphasizes the role of innovation versus development ( in the jargon used in that research community : exploration versus exploitation  @xcite ) while evolving bit strings according to an oversimplification of the general principles that hold for the evolution of biological systems . in the light of these observations , we deem that the emergence of innovation can be viewed as an evolutionary process where several actors are involved ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , some of them propose new ideas , while others develop these ideas turning them into practical technologies , services , and so on . as a matter of fact",
    ", the actual characteristics of an individual typically lay in the middle between innovators and developers .",
    "however , to better investigate the coexistence between these characters , we assume that an individual can be either innovator or developer . besides",
    ", a similar view has also been proposed in the field of mathematics by dyson  @xcite , who divided mathematicians in two groups : birds and frogs . according to his picture , the former fly high in the air and survey broad vistas of mathematics out to the far horizons , and becoming aware about the connections between different fields , while the latter from their position are able to appreciate with more detail the flowers that grow nearby , i.e. they have a more granular and fine views of mathematical concepts and theories .",
    "this work is aimed at investigating the tight relationship that holds between innovators and developers , studying the underlying process using the evolutionary game theory framework  @xcite ( egt hereinafter ) . to this end a specific game , named  innovation game  ,",
    "has been set up for shading light on the equilibria reached by a population composed of innovators and developers .",
    "the first issue that has been tackled was about the underlying context within which interactions between innovators and developers are supposed to occur . in fact , despite the availability of many tools that have been devised in support of collaborative work , apparently the most effective collaborations among humans still occurs on a local basis . as a consequence ,",
    "our population splits into small groups with fixed size , though preserving the possibility of rendering pseudo - random groups . in so doing ,",
    "we admit the possibility of ensuring mobility among agents , depending on the adopted grouping strategy . in either case",
    ", the density of innovators in a group ( @xmath0 , hereinafter ) constitutes a parameter of the system .",
    "we then concentrated on how to model the presence of innovators and developers in a group .",
    "let us briefly summarize the concerns about innovators and developers .",
    "as for innovators , although their presence is mandatory to get new insights , we had to consider the fact that they often represent a risk for they may be not successful at all over long periods of time .",
    "to account for both aspects , we introduced an _ award factor _ , aimed at accounting for the benefit for including innovators in a group , together with a penalty , aimed at accounting for the cost of unsuccessful insights ( or no insights at all ) over time .",
    "as for developers , their modeling did not require any specific care , as they typically tend to be effective from the very beginning of any activity they are involved in ( e.g. , a research project ) , and tend to establish tight relationships with their neighbors and with the hosting structure as well .",
    "then , we had to model the way innovative thinking can propagate over the given population . to better understand the underlying issues ,",
    "let us consider the relevant ( and well - known ) case concerning scientific publications . in this case",
    ", the whole process starts with publishing the results concerning a novel insight , or an improvement over an existing idea , in a scientific journal .",
    "depending on the degree of `` penetrance '' of the published paper , it may be undergo citations and the underlying idea or technology may be further improved by other people .",
    "hence , at least in principle , one can evaluate publications in accordance with the amount of citations .",
    "it is worth to clarify that receiving a citation ( i.e. a mention and/or further attention ) does not imply that an idea is more important than another .",
    "it just means that a community , according to its guidelines and rules , decides to follow and investigate specific ideas rather than others ( let us recall , for instance , that both einstein s general relativity and the higgs s boson required a lot of time before being accepted and recognized as real breakthroughs ) .",
    "notwithstanding the peculiarities related to the time required for a novel insight to be accepted and disseminated within the scientific community , in either case the number of novelties appears to be tightly related with the amount of innovators see fig .",
    "[ fig : innovators_function ] .    ) in a population with @xmath1 agents .",
    "each curve refers to results achieved using a different threshold @xmath2 , which can be used to measure the amount of innovation e.g .",
    ", the number of citations in a scientific context or the number of implementations of a new technology . the main role of thresholds ( i.e. @xmath2 ) is to link the emergence of novelties with the need of a community of developers able to put them into practice .",
    "results has been averaged over different simulation runs .",
    "[ fig : innovators_function],scaledwidth=55.0% ]    going back to our attempt to model the innovation game , it should be now clearer the reason why the density of innovators @xmath0 becomes a crucial parameter of the model . in this scenario ,",
    "one may wonder whether increasing the mobility among agents increases the density of innovators ( while keeping fixed the amount of available resources ) in a system where each agent can change its behavior according to a gained payoff , i.e. being driven by a rational mindset .",
    "this question is also motivated by qualitative observations of the real world .",
    "for instance , many researchers like to spend part of their time visiting external labs , and in general workers often change companies also for improving their experience and skills . in addition , also biology suggests that mobility can be helpful for new solutions , as marriages between individuals without any degree of kinship reduce the probability to transmit diseases to their offspring .",
    "eventually , as below reported , results confirmed our hypothesis and suggest also that the emergence of innovation depends on the resources assigned to it .",
    "summarizing , the proposed innovation game occurs within a population of agents organized in groups of size @xmath3 . here , the payoff of each agent depends on the following factors : the heterogeneity of the formed groups , the number of innovators @xmath4 in these groups , and an award factor @xmath5 .",
    "the latter is a numerical parameter that represents the efforts made by a system for promoting innovation .",
    "hence , the payoff can be defined as follows : @xmath6 with @xmath7 magnetization  @xcite , introduced for measuring the group heterogeneity , which in our case reads @xmath8 with @xmath9 number of developers in the group . assigning to innovators a spin equal to @xmath10 , and to developers a spin equal to @xmath11",
    ", the value of @xmath7 falls in the range @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the population evolves according to the following dynamics : at each time step , one agent ( say @xmath13 ) is randomly selected , with one of its neighbors ( say @xmath14 ) .",
    "so , according to the group to which they belong , @xmath13 and @xmath14 receive a payoff ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : payoff ] .",
    "then , the agent @xmath14 imitates ( see also  @xcite ) the strategy of the agent @xmath13 with a probability depending on the difference between their payoffs , so that the greater @xmath17 , the greater the probability that @xmath14 imitates @xmath13 . as for the probability that @xmath14 imitates @xmath13 , it is computed by a fermi - like function : @xmath18\\right)^{-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 and @xmath20 strategies of the two considered agents , @xmath21 noise ( temperature ) , set to @xmath22 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "[ eq : payoff ] can be divided into two parts : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the former allows to promote heterogeneous groups , as the magnetization @xmath7 goes to @xmath25 when the amount of innovators approaches that of developers in the same group .",
    "the second part represents the additional fee ( i.e. the cost ) due to the presence of innovators . from a statistical physics point of view  @xcite",
    ", the dynamics of the population can be assimilated to that of a spin system , so that at high temperature one expects a disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase , while at low temperatures ( i.e. lower than the critical one @xmath26 ) one expects an ordered ( ferromagnetic ) phase .",
    "notably , the paramagnetic phase corresponds to a population composed of both kinds of agents , whereas the ferromagnetic one corresponds to the presence of only one species .",
    "thus , at low temperatures , if the payoff is composed only of the first ( left ) part and starting with a mixed population ( i.e. at @xmath27 the density of innovators is equal to @xmath22 ) , at equilibrium one observes a disordered phase composed by the same amount of innovators and developers .",
    "conversely , due to the presence of the right term in eq .",
    "[ eq : payoff ] , the expected equilibrium ( at low temperatures ) corresponds to a population composed of only developers ( i.e. @xmath28 ) . in our view , the _ award factor _ can be mapped to the temperature of a spin system . in doing so , for different values of @xmath5 , we can draw the resulting agent combinations in a group with @xmath29 individuals see fig .",
    "[ fig : basic ] .        remarkably , the right part of eq .",
    "[ eq : payoff ] plays the role of  field generator  , since for low values of @xmath5 , there is only one possible ordered equilibrium , as observed in a spin system at low temperatures in presence of an external field .",
    "apparently , the plot * c * of fig .  [ fig : basic ] , reporting a scheme @xmath5 versus @xmath30 , highlights that three different phases indicated as * ( 1 ) * , * ( 2 ) * , and * ( 3 ) * emerge .",
    "clearly , here it is worth to clarify that both * ( 1 ) * and * ( 2 ) * correspond to a paramagnetic phase ( as shown on the right side of the schema , illustrating a pictorial representation of the free energy  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , phase * ( 1 ) * can be achieved only for high values of @xmath5 , when the effect of the field generator becomes too small for affecting the system , i.e. the imitation process .",
    "notably , as shown in plots  * a * and * b * of fig .",
    "[ fig : basic ] , increasing @xmath5 the payoff becomes a symmetric function around the value @xmath31 .",
    "the latter represents the case with an equal amount of innovators and developers .",
    "then , according to a preliminary overview driven by statistical physics , we aim to characterize the phase transition occurring in our population on varying its temperature , i.e. the _ award factor_. thus , we can link the related result with the scenario represented in fig .  [",
    "fig : density_innovators ] , so that for a given amount of resources one knows the expected number of innovations ( e.g. , original ideas ) over time .",
    "in order to investigate the dynamics of the proposed model and its equilibria , we performed numerical simulations . to this end , we considered two different configurations : a well - mixed population and a population arranged on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions . considering a number of agents @xmath32 , the side of the square lattice is @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , setting @xmath29 , each agent in the lattice belongs to @xmath34 different groups , therefore also for the well - mixed case we consider this scenario .",
    "now , it is important to emphasize that comparing the dynamics of the model in the two described configurations has two main motivations .",
    "first , we can evaluate if the  network - reciprocity  effect  @xcite supports innovation , as it does for the cooperation in dilemma games ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "second , the well - mixed case allows to represent a sort of  mobility  effect , so that we can evaluate its influence in the dynamics of the population , which can be helpful to shade light on the hypothesis that mobility is able to support innovation .",
    "figure  [ fig : density_innovators ] shows the density of innovators @xmath0 , at equilibrium ( or after @xmath35 time steps ) , in function of @xmath5 .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=55.0% ]    as expected , for high values of @xmath5 , both configurations show that the density of innovators slowly tends to @xmath22 . instead ,",
    "for low values of @xmath5 we find a critical threshold @xmath36 .",
    "remarkably , in the well - mixed case , @xmath36 is smaller than in the lattice topology , indicating that with poor resources , innovators survive only when some kind of mobility is introduced in the system .    ,",
    "i.e. @xmath37 in function of @xmath5 , for both configurations : * a * ) well mixed and * b * ) regular lattice .",
    "[ fig : variance_innovators],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    then , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance_innovators ] , we studied the variance of @xmath0 , confirming the relevance of the critical values observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_innovators ] . with the aim to characterize , at least on a quality level , the nature of the transition occurring in our population tuning the value of @xmath5",
    ", we studied the system magnetization .",
    "notably , the latter is an order parameter  @xcite , whose relation with the temperature @xmath38 ( represented by @xmath5 in the proposed model ) , is well known in statistical physics ( although not always simple to quantify ) .     in function of @xmath5 .",
    "the inset shows a focus of @xmath39 in the small range close to the critical value , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : magnetization],scaledwidth=55.0% ]    a glance to the system magnetization suggests that the observed phase transition can be classified as of first - order . in particular ,",
    "once that @xmath5 increases up to @xmath36 , innovators are able to survive and quickly reach a density similar to that of developers .",
    "this work studies the emergence of innovation under the framework of evolutionary game theory . in particular , by means of a model , inspired to the well - known dyson s",
    "@xcite classification of mathematicians , we analyze the dynamics of a population in terms of innovators and developers . in the proposed model innovators are expected to generate benefits for the society , although they represent also a risk as their work can sometimes be unsuccessful . in order to investigate all related issues , we defined a game where agents form small groups ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "their payoff depends on the heterogeneity of these groups ( see  @xcite ) , on the amount of innovators , and on an award factor .",
    "notably , heterogeneity supports the emergence of groups composed of both kinds of agents .",
    "the amount of innovators is controlled by an additional fee which basically includes in the model the fact that they may be unsuccessful for long periods of time .",
    "eventually , the award factor represents the policy of a system in favor of innovation .",
    "it is worth recalling that the award factor plays a role similar to that of the synergy factor used in the public goods game for promoting cooperation  @xcite . after providing a brief overview of the proposed model inspired by statistical physics , mainly based on the structure of the payoff ( eq .  [ eq : payoff ] )",
    ", we performed many numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , two main configurations have been investigated : square lattice , with periodic boundary conditions , and well - mixed populations .",
    "notably , the latter allows to represent a mobility effect , which is very important in several real contexts .",
    "simulations showed that the  network reciprocity ",
    "effect  @xcite , useful for promoting cooperation in many dilemma games having a nash equilibrium of defection , here reduces the amount of innovators .",
    "in addition , we found that the mobility effect plays a beneficial role for supporting innovation , in particular when poor resources ( e.g. , financial ) are reserved for innovation .",
    "going forward to real systems , we deem that our results may be a starting point to provide general interpretations of well known phenomena .",
    "in fact , the density of innovators could even be interpreted as the fraction of time allowed to people , working in a company or institution , to devise new projects and/or ideas . a notable example in support of this interpretation are some online services provided by google ( e.g. , gmail  @xcite ) , which have been devised and designed by collaborators that were allowed to spend a fraction of their working time on new and independent projects .",
    "finally , we studied the order - disorder phase transition occurring in our model , computing the critical thresholds of the award factor ( i.e. @xmath36 ) .",
    "the latter allows to link the model to a simpler scenario , that investigates whether a trade - off between innovators and developers in a society can be found ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : innovators_function ] ) .",
    "it is worth highlighting that , from a game theory perspective , our model is not a dilemma game , like for instance the prisoner s dilemma  @xcite . in other words , here",
    "agents do not take decisions choosing between their own benefit and that of their community . before concluding ,",
    "let us to spend few words about a possible experimental validation of our model .",
    "it is well known that , in the era of big data  @xcite , the access to real data may allow to verify the correctness of hypotheses and theoretical models .",
    "remarkably , while the latter allow to speculate about the nature of a phenomenon , often providing useful insights , direct investigation , based on real data , typically allow to confirm ( or confute ) theories , and often open the way to new developments . in this work",
    ", we followed only a theoretical approach , based on qualitative observations of real scenarios .",
    "however , notwithstanding the fact that the model proposed in this work has not yet been validated with real - world data , let us briefly describe the kinds of dataset that might be suitable to this extent . in our view , a main experimental scenario would be the world of academia . in principle , every scientific paper that describes an original research represents an innovation .",
    "hence , a dataset where research grants , and other forms of support , related to a group , to a department or to an university , could be very helpful to investigate the correlation between funding , publication of scientific articles and innovation .",
    "in this context , a more granular dataset , e.g. , describing the amount of funding devised for exchange programs ( as visiting professorship and/or studentship ) , would allow to evaluate if the proposed model can fit real - word data on mobility and its capability to promote innovation .",
    "considering industry , real data related to the investments of companies on innovation , as well as in supporting employers to attend workshops and conferences , could be useful .",
    "obviously , in this case , real exchange programs ( as those that hold for academia ) often can not be implemented for a number of reasons .",
    "however , promoting the attendance to events like workshops might be considered , to some extent , as a kind of mobility . here , the task would be to identify relations between the amount of financial resources reserved for mobility ( as above described ) , by a company and the level of innovation of its products or services . as well as the amount of time granted to collaborators for developing independent projects .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the proposed model finds some preliminary confirmations .",
    "notably , mapping the mobility effect to the way people get married ( see also  @xcite ) , i.e. promoting marriages between people that belong to different families , strongly helps to reduce the transmission of hereditary diseases .",
    "as for future work , we aim to analyze the proposed model by arranging agents on more complex topologies ( e.g. , scale - free networks ) .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed on a square lattice with continuous boundary conditions and in a non - structured population , so that all agents have a degree equal to @xmath40 , i.e. they have four nearest - neighbors . in both configurations ,",
    "agents form @xmath34 groups of size @xmath29 , and the population evolves according to the following dynamics :    1 .",
    "define a population with @xmath41 agents , with the same amount of innovators and developers ( i.e. @xmath42 = 0.5 ) 2 .",
    "randomly select an agent , say @xmath13 , and one of its neighbors , say @xmath14 3 .   according to their respective @xmath34 groups of belonging , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "gain a payoff ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) 4 .   agent @xmath14 imitates the strategy of @xmath13 according to the probability defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : prob_transition ] 5 .",
    "repeat from @xmath43 , until the population reaches an ordered phase or a number of time steps @xmath38 elapsed    the ordered phase mentioned in step @xmath44 indicates those configurations where agents have the same strategy / behavior .",
    "the maximum number or time steps has been set to @xmath45 .",
