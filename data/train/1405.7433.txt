    "the _ resonant _ and _ near - resonant _ ttvs occur when orbital periods , when divided by each other , are equal or nearly equal to a ratio of small integers .",
    "the planetary perturbations tend to build up in this situation , leading to ttvs with a large amplitude .    the detection of ( near-)resonant ttvs is expected if a large set of transit observations is available , because some planetary systems are bound to have ( near-)resonant orbits ( either due to statistics or because they are driven to these orbits by formation processes ) .",
    "the description of planetary properties from ( near-)resonant ttvs , however , is plagued with degeneracies , which may be resolved only under certain assumptions ( lithwick et al . 2012 ) .",
    "this happens , in essence , because the ( near-)resonant ttvs are limited in the information content .",

    "it is also obvious , in the approximation of eqs .",
    "( [ deltat])-([chi ] ) , that @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath6 , independent of @xmath40 , and scales linearly with the companion mass",
    ".    the short - periodic ttvs are more difficult to detect observationally then the ( near-)resonant ttvs , because they generally have a small amplitude .",
    "if they are detected , however , they can be used to _",

    "this has been theoretically demonstrated in nesvorn & beaug ( 2010 ) under the assumption that there is no a priori information about the ( non - transiting ) companion , and done in practice in holman et al .",

    "thus , if at least a few of these terms are detected in real data , the information contained in the detection is high enough to make the inversion to orbital elements possible ( e.g. , nesvorn et al . 2012 ) .    an important component of the short - periodic ttvs , which is the main focus here , is produced by _",
    "conjunctions _ between planets .",
    "the conjunction effect can be conveniently illustrated using kepler-36c ( carter et al .",
    "2012 ) and koi-884.02 ( nesvorn et al .",

    "these discontinuities are produced at conjunctions with the outer massive planet ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass of jupiter ; nesvorn et al .",
    "the ttvs of kepler-36c , on the other hand , are a series of approximately linear segments that are tilted relative to each other at different angles ( carter et al .",
    "these discontinuities correspond to the orbital conjunctions between kepler-36c and the inner transiting planet kepler-36b . in this case , the very tight spacing of two orbits at ( or very near to ) the 7:6 resonance implies the physical distance between planets to be small near conjunctions , and large variations are therefore expected . in general , for a @xmath43:@xmath44 resonance , we expect the conjunctions to occur in every @xmath44 periods of the outer planet ( and @xmath45 periods of the inner one ) .",
    "this is why , in figure [ obs]b , groups of @xmath46 transits share the same linear ephemeris ( note that some transits are missing due to instrumental and other issues ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to theoretically understand the effect of conjunctions from eqs .",
    "( [ deltat])-([chi ] ) , mainly because the ttv discontinuities occurring at conjunctions are difficult to approximate by the fourier series , and because these equations include many different terms such that it is not clear which ones are responsible for the conjunction effect .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a simple model for the conjunction effect that can be used as an intuitive guideline for more realistic modeling of cases such as the ones shown in figure [ obs ] .    in section 2",
    ", we derive an analytic model of conjunctions in the limit of small orbital eccentricities . in section 3 ,",
    "we test our model by comparing it with numerical integrations of the full equations of motion , and determine the domain of parameters where the analytic model is valid . in section 4 , we show how the magnitude of the conjunction effect scales with different parameters . finally , in section 5 , we discuss how the detection of the conjunction effect can be used to confirm and characterize transiting planetary systems .",
    "we consider a system of two planets with masses @xmath47 and @xmath48 orbiting about a central star with mass @xmath17 .",

    "the analytic model developed in the previous sections can be used as a guideline to understand the basic effects of conjunctions on the ttvs .",
    "we will discuss these effects , and their scaling with different parameters , in section 4 .",
    "before we do so , however , we first establish the domain of validity of the analytic model by comparing the results to those obtained from an exact @xmath210-body integration .",
    "this comparison was done with the @xmath210-body code described in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , where the ttvs are computed with an efficient and precise algorithm ( also see deck et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "figure [ comp1 ] illustrates the results for the test case previously shown in figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] . here",
    "the results of the analytic model are in an excellent agreement with those obtained from the @xmath210-body integration .",
    "this was expected because the parameters of the test case were set to be in the domain where the analytic model should be valid ( e.g. , small planetary masses , @xmath34 not too large , and @xmath211 ) .    in general , however , the analytic model is obviously only an approximation of the conjunction effect .",
    "first , the two orbits were assumed to be strictly coplanar .",
    "second , we assumed that @xmath212 , such that @xmath57 can be treated as a perturbation of @xmath94 .",
    "terms of the second and higher orders in @xmath213 were not included .",
    "third , we assumed that @xmath214 , expanded the hamiltonian in powers of @xmath136 , and retained only the lowest power of @xmath136 .",
    "we therefore expect the analytic model to be valid only for very nearly circular orbits of both planets .",
    "figure [ limit1 ] illustrates the approximate nature of the analytic model . to make this figure , we surveyed a range of orbital separations and eccentricities ( @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) .",
    "other parameters were held fixed ( @xmath218 , @xmath132 ) . in each case",
    ", we followed dynamics over one conjunction cycle and determined the ( i ) amplitude of @xmath1 variation produced as a result of conjunction , and ( ii ) the difference between analytically and numerically computed @xmath1 when @xmath97 approaches @xmath111 ( i.e. , at the end of the conjunction cycle ) . from this , by dividing ( ii ) by ( i ) , we computed the relative error of the analytic model as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .    from figure [ limit1 ]",
    "we see that the analytic model is valid only for small eccentricities , and the eccentricity threshold ( @xmath219 ) beyond which the relative error is excessive ( say @xmath22010% ) is a strong function of the radial separation between orbits . for example , @xmath221 for @xmath222 while @xmath223 for @xmath224 , this is expected because the second and higher order effects in @xmath213 , neglected in our analytic model , should become important with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "also , we would need to include eccentricity terms beyond the lowest power to make the analytic model more generally valid for larger eccentricities .",
    "we used @xmath225 in figure [ limit1 ] , but it turns out that the general appearance of this figure is independent of the considered planetary masses .",
    "this is because both the magnitude of the conjunction effect and the error of the analytic model increase ( nearly ) linearly with @xmath213 .",
    "the relative error therefore remains approximately the same .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath213 sets the limit in @xmath34 beyond which the analytic model does not apply . beyond this limit",
    ", the co - orbital dynamics appears and the two planets can switch positions radially ( i.e. , following the horseshoe or tadpole trajectory the inner planet becomes an outer one , and vice versa ) .",
    "in this situation , @xmath34 , as defined here , evolves from @xmath226 to @xmath227 , and the fourier expansion of @xmath57 in section 2.1 becomes divergent .",
    "the ttvs occurring for two planets in the co - orbital regime were recently investigated by vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2014 ) .",
    "finally , as we already mentioned at the beginning of section 2.2 , our analytic model is valid but not really useful if @xmath34 is small .",
    "in such a case , the conjunctions between planets can not be described as a discrete effect , because the gravitational interaction of planets is similarly strong for any phase of @xmath97 .",
    "for small @xmath34 , we therefore find it more intuitive to use the representation in eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) , where the ttvs are fully expanded in the fourier series .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is gradual such that it is difficult to establish a single value of @xmath34 where this transition happens .",
    "we roughly find that our analytic model of conjunctions is useful for @xmath228 , while the fourier series representation becomes more adequate for @xmath229 .",
    "according to eqs . ( [ dt1 ] ) and ( [ dt2 ] ) ,",
    "the expected variation of transit timing , @xmath1 , is proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the orbital period of the transiting planet .",
    "thus , assuming that the observation baseline is long enough to cover several conjunction cycles , the detection of the conjunction effect would be easier for planets with longer orbital periods , for which the effect is larger .",
    "in reality , however , the current observational baselines are typically only a few years such that we do not expect that the ttvs to be generally detectable for long - period planets .",
    "the conjunction effect could potentially be detected for long - period planets only if at least a few transits were observed before the conjunction and a few transits after the conjunction , which would require a fortuitous configuration of the planetary system at the current epoch ( a good example of this can be koi-351 g ; cabrera et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the scaling of @xmath1 with the planetary and stellar masses is obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ dt1 ] ) and ( [ dt2 ] ) , at least in the approximation @xmath212 that we adopted in the analytic model .",
    "while @xmath230 scales linearly with @xmath32 , @xmath231 scales linearly with @xmath31 .",
    "this means that a detection of the conjunction effect in transits of the inner planet can help to determine the mass of the outer planet , and vice versa . also , the detection of transit variations is obviously easier in a system with more massive planets and , for a fixed orbital period , with lower stellar mass .",
    "figure [ scale1 ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath77 .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure show the amplitude of the @xmath232 change from a single conjunction between planets . from eqs .",
    "( [ dl1 ] ) and ( [ dl2 ] ) , the amplitude is @xmath233 for the inner planet and @xmath234 for the outer planet , where @xmath235 and @xmath236 are given in terms of the complete elliptic integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ cc1c ] ) and ( [ cc2c ] ) . the total conjunction effect from @xmath237",
    "is shown by solid lines in figure [ scale1 ] .",
    "the basic tendency is that the magnitude of the conjunction effect strongly increases with @xmath34 , such that it is @xmath238 - 200 times stronger for planets with @xmath239 than for planets with @xmath240 .",
    "this is reasonable because the closely packed planetary systems are expected to have stronger gravitational interactions .    in the example given in figure [ scale1 ] with @xmath241 , @xmath132 and @xmath130  au , the magnitude of @xmath1 ranges from 3 minutes ( inner planet , @xmath222 ) to over 10 hours ( outer planet , @xmath242 ) . assuming instead that the outer planet with @xmath130 au has one earth mass , the ttvs of the inner planet should range between @xmath243 minute and @xmath244 hours .",
    "they should therefore be generally detectable with adequate photometric precision .",
    "figure [ scale2 ] shows how the amplitude of the conjunction effect changes with eccentricity . given that our analytic model loses precision with increasing eccentricity ( see figure 5 ) , here we used our @xmath210-body code to compute @xmath1 over one conjunction cycle .",
    "in addition to changing @xmath34 as in figure [ scale1 ] , we also varied the initial eccentricities of the two planets .",
    "figure [ scale2 ] shows that the amplitude of the conjunction effect can increase by a factor of @xmath245 - 10 by increasing the eccentricity from 0 to 0.1 .",
    "this is significant , because it shows that the likelihood of detection of the conjunction effect can be boosted for orbits with modest eccentricities , a case that should presumably be common among planetary systems .",
    "the magnitude of the conjunction effect for eccentric orbits , however , also depends on the relative orientation of orbits , as given by @xmath246 and @xmath247 , and on where exactly the conjunction happens along the orbits",
    ". the magnitude can increase or decrease , roughly reflecting the physical distance between planets during the conjunction .",
    "figure [ scale2 ] was produced by surveying all orbital configurations , @xmath248 and @xmath249 , and plotting the one for which the magnitude was maximal .",
    "figure [ scale3 ] shows how the amplitude of the conjunction effect changes with the mutual inclination between orbits , @xmath250 . as in figure [ scale2 ]",
    "we used the @xmath210-body code to compute @xmath1 over one conjunction cycle .",
    "figure [ scale2 ] illustrates that the amplitude of the conjunction effect is not very sensitive to @xmath250 .",
    "the magnitude varies only up to @xmath25120% for @xmath252 , relative to to the case with @xmath253 .",
    "see nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for a more general analysis of the dependence of the short - periodic ttvs on orbital inclinations .",
    "equations ( [ dt1 ] ) and ( [ dt2 ] ) express our expectation for the ttvs produced by two planets on nearly circular and coplanar orbits .",
    "the first two terms in these equations result from the direct perturbation of the mean longitude .",
    "if @xmath34 is sufficiently close to 1 , these terms are essentially equivalent to a succession of transit timing discontinuities occurring at orbital conjunctions between planets .",
    "the amplitude of these discontinuities is @xmath233 for the inner planet and @xmath234 for the outer planet , where @xmath235 and @xmath236 were defined in eqs .",
    "( [ cc1c ] ) and ( [ cc2c ] ) and were illustrated in figure [ scale1 ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the transit times of the inner planet are expected to be delayed relative to a fixed keplerian ephemeris , while those of the outer planet are expected to be sped up .",
    "the long - term effects of conjunctions , with @xmath1 steadily accumulating over many periods of the synodic angle , can be absorbed by a small change of the orbital period .",
    "the short - period effects of conjunctions , frequently described as ` chopping ' of the ttv signal ( e.g , holman et al .",
    "2010 , carter et al .",
    "2012 ) , should not be mistaken with anything else . when the long - term conjunction effects are removed from the transit ephemeris , the ttv signal from direct perturbation of the mean longitude should have a saw - like profile with each tooth being marked by a few rising and a few declining transits .",
    "if such a saw - tooth profile is identified in the data , the mass of planetary companion can be extracted from these measurements , assuming that @xmath34 is known , by using eqs .",

    "( 33 ) . for a comparison ,",
    "the actual steps in koi-884.02 s ttvs , best seen for transit cycles between 32 and 45 ( figure 1a ) , are @xmath2631 - 2 hours . the difference is probably caused by small but significant orbital eccentricities ( nesvorn et al .",

    "it can be useful to perform the fourier analysis of @xmath1 .",
    "the expectation is that this will reveal frequencies that are integer multiples of @xmath264 .",
    "some of these frequencies will be faster than the nyquist frequency , @xmath265 , and will be aliased to the part of the fourier spectrum with @xmath266 .",
    "for example , in the test case shown in figure [ comp1 ] , @xmath267 d@xmath268 .",
    "therefore , frequencies @xmath269 d@xmath268 and @xmath270  d@xmath268 appear unaliased , while all @xmath168 frequencies with @xmath271 are aliased to @xmath272 . for example , @xmath273 d@xmath268 appears at @xmath274 d@xmath268 .    as for koi-884 , @xmath275 d@xmath268 and @xmath276 d@xmath268 .",
    "as @xmath277 in this case , the synodic frequency and all its multiples will be aliased .",
    "for example , @xmath264 should appear at @xmath278 d@xmath268 , and @xmath279 should appear at @xmath280 d@xmath268 .",
    "the fourier analysis of the best fit ttv model from nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2014 ) confirms this .",
    "it shows that the peak power density of the @xmath279 term is about five times larger than that of the @xmath264 term , as expected from eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 33 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these terms are much harder to identify in the existing ttv data of koi-884.02 , because of the short coverage , gaps , measurement errors , and other issues .",
    "we have done a similar analysis for kepler-36 , but do not discuss it here , except for pointing out that the aliasing is not a problem for this system , because the synodic frequency @xmath264 is relatively slow ( as @xmath239 ) .",
    "identifying the structure of unaliased and aliased frequencies in the frequency domain can be useful for the interpretation of the ttv observations . as the amplitudes of these terms are proportional to @xmath281 , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ dt1 ] ) or ( [ dt2 ] ) , the ttv measurements can be potentially inverted to obtain a unique determination of the planetary mass and orbital separation ( e.g. , nesvorn et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this highlights the importance of the conjunction effect .    as a final word of caution ,",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ dt1 ] ) or ( [ dt2 ] ) were derived under several assumptions .",
    "most importantly , these equations are valid only for small orbital eccentricities .",
    "while many planetary systems will presumably fall into this category , perhaps the majority of them will not .",
    "the ttvs for planetary systems with orbital eccentricities exceeding the threshold shown in figure [ limit1 ] will contain many additional terms from the first and higher eccentricity powers .",
    "these terms will add frequencies @xmath282 , with arbitrary @xmath38 and @xmath39 , potentially generating resonant or near - resonant ttvs , and will modify the amplitude dependence of the @xmath283 frequencies on orbital parameters .",
    "the analytic model described here therefore can not be used _ in general _ to characterize the planetary systems from ttvs ."
