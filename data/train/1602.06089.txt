    "fuller and tabor ( 1975 ) were perhaps the first to measure adhesion of low modulus materials like smooth rubber lenses against roughened surfaces , and clearly showed very small amounts of roughness amplitude ( few microns ) were sufficient to destroy adhesion almost completely .",
    "they then proceeded to develop an asperity model , which is commonly believed not to permit enhancement of adhesion , but instead very rapid extinction . in nature , various mechanisms have been shown to lead to adhesion enhancements in insects which use adhesion for their locomotion including varying the shape of each contact as well as increasing the number of them , so as to obtain a benefit from contact splitting ( hui _ et al_. , 2004 , kamperman _ et al _ , 2010 , gao &  yao , 2004 , yao &  gao , 2006 ) .",
    "adhesion enhancement was measured by briggs & briscoe ( 1977 ) , and fuller & roberts ( 1981 ) , who were unable to explain the data , particularly the increase of energy dissipation .",
    "persson ( 2002 ) postulated that an increase of adhesion may occur for the increase of surface area induced by roughness , but later on this has been shown to be not the reason for the enhancement clearly explained by guduru and collaborators ( guduru ( 2007 ) , guduru &  bull ( 2007 ) , waters _",
    "et al _ ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "guduru s solution is a very classical contact mechanics exact solution assuming a simply connected contact area develops in a spherical contact having a concentric axisymmetric waviness .",
    "clearly , as it was apparent also to guduru ( 2007 ) , there are some limitations for this solution to hold , as one expects the contact to occur only on the crests of the waviness , for `` sufficiently '' large amplitude roughness and this would limit the enhancement shown in the simply connected contact area model .",
    "the separated contact solution is unfortunately not possible in closed form , and therefore it was not studied by guduru , who noticed however the is a large set of conditions for which we could assume it holds .",
    "guduru s theory is very brilliantly described and corroborated by experiments , and serves the main purpose of showing when the enhancement can occur .",
    "however , we move here from a opposite perspective , trying to understand why the large enhancement is not commonly observed . we will therefore discuss two main aspects of the solution : the assumption of simply connected contact area , and the assumption of jkr regime .",
    "regarding the first aspect , guduru ( 2007 ) writes a condition on the monotonicity of the profile function which guarantees a simply connected area , but limits the amplitude of roughness in fact to regions where the enhancement is not too large .",
    "guduru recognized that the condition is over - restrictive , in that , for sufficiently large pressure during loading , we may expect the simply connected area to being established , and therefore full enhancement may occur . regarding the second aspect , waters _",
    "et al _ ( 2009 ) develop a maugis - dugdale solution with an annulus of uniform tension at the edge of the contact area , showing enhancement is limited to the jkr regime .",
    "however , they seem to imply , at least with the limited set of parameters they study , the limit should be that of a dmt smooth sphere , which in the case of a rough sphere , is in fact , although not an enhancement , still very high .",
    "we will therefore consider a limit case , that of rigid bodies in contact , showing that the limit is more complex than that , and permitting a very large reduction indeed .",
    "much of the debate on adhesion of spherical bodies has concentrated on the transition from the dmt theory ( see greewood , 2007 for a detailed treatment about this controversial theory ) to the jkr limit . however , the two theories differ , for pull - off , only on a small prefactor ( 3/2 in jkr , and 2 in dmt ) , whereas the more we understand about the effect of roughness on adhesion , the more we are confused between orders of magnitude reduction ( as it is commonly observed ) and 1 order of magnitude enhancement ( or higher ? ) , as guduru s theory shows .",
    "this note therefore attempts to compare various results in order to hopefully arrive at a better comprehension between these extreme limits .    in some of the developments , we use the recently developed asymptotic expansion of guduru s solution developed by kesari _",
    "et al _ ( 2010,2011 ) , finding some reduced parameter dependence in the solution , which in fact is exactly a jkr solution , different in the loading and the unloading phase .",
    "we examine therefore where this solution holds , therefore providing some hopefully insight in further understanding of the more general complex problem of adhesion in rough surfaces which , in view of the competition between enhancement and reduction mechanisms , is still not well understood .",
    "waters _ et al _ ( 2009 ) give a good summary of guduru s theory and experiments .",
    "they have a surface defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the sphere radius , @xmath2 is wavelength of roughness , @xmath3 is its amplitude , and @xmath4 can be both positive in the case of a central convex asperity , and negative , for a central concave trough .",
    "the solution of the contact problem with adhesion is possible assuming a simply connected contact area , as a function of two parameters @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the surface energy , and @xmath7 the plane strain elastic modulus .",
    "the results are given in terms of a dimensionless load @xmath8 so that @xmath9 corresponds to the smooth sphere , and also for dimensionless approach @xmath10 , and contact radius @xmath11 ,",
    "as@xmath12 -\\frac{8}{3}\\sqrt{\\beta\\widehat{a}^{3}}\\\\ \\widehat{h}_{g}\\left (   \\widehat{a}\\right )    &   = \\widehat{a}^{2}+\\alpha\\pi ^{2}\\widehat{a}h_{0}\\left (   2\\pi\\widehat{a}\\right )   -\\sqrt{\\widehat{a}/\\beta}\\ ] ]    kesari _ et al _ ( 2010,2011 ) have developed a very elegant `` envelope '' solution of the guduru problem .",
    "the envelop is obtained by joining in an asymptotic solution for small roughness sizes , in particular @xmath13 : said otherwise , there much be enough wavelengths of roughness in the contact area  a condition quite close to what was used in the archard cascade process of redistribution of loads in the adhesionless contact problem ( ciavarella _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) ) , and which can be checked a posteriori .",
    "they notice that the solution has some simplified behaviour but do not further discuss this aspect .",
    "the envelop solution in terms of load and indentation depth is@xmath14 where we have grouped the term with the same power in contact radius @xmath15  the theory obviously corresponds to the known jkr theory for @xmath16 .",
    "an obvious remark about the equations ( [ kesari_load],[kesari_approach ] ) is that they are _ exactly _ those of the jkr theory also in the case of roughness , but with a corrected ( _ enhanced _ or _ reduced _ , respectively for unloading or loading ) surface energy @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the parameter johnson ( 1995 ) introduced for the jkr adhesion of a nominally flat contact having a single scale sinusoidal waviness of amplitude @xmath4 and wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "we can also recast the jkr `` envelope '' equations of kesari _ et al _ ( 2011 )  in terms of only one of the guduru dimensionless parameters , @xmath19 together with @xmath20@xmath21    it is therefore very interesting that the increase of adhesion should scale with the same parameter of sinusoidal contact .",
    "it is also very interesting and unexpected a priori that an important value for this parameter in eqt .",
    "( [ kesari1 ] , [ kesari2 ] ) is @xmath22 which is exactly the value for which the sinusoid self - flattens to full contact under no applied load . in fact , the behaviour of a sinusoidal contact should be explained in few words , following fig.1 , where @xmath20 is indicated as @xmath23 because in general , for a multiscale roughness , this parameter can only be defined appropriately to a single sinusoid , and in particular tends to increase for low fractal dimensions , which is the common case observed in practice ( see afferrante _",

    "behaviour of a nominally flat single sinusoidal contact    suppose we follow the curve corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "under zero load , since the curve is decreasing ( and hence unstable ) , the contact will `` jump '' to point b , similarly to any jkr solution . from this point on , a compressive load @xmath26 ,",
    "moves the system along the curve bc , until at point c , again instability occurs and complete contact occurs .",
    "the maximum mean pressure needed to establish full contact is a fraction @xmath27 of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pressure for full contact without adhesion , and reduces with @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath30 , partial contact does not occur and the surfaces immediately snap together until full contact occurs . at that point ,",
    "when contact is established , it can be maintained also for negative arbitrarily high ( tensile ) mean pressures , provided @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a negative parameter , function of @xmath23 .",
    "notice there is a discussion in waters _",
    "et al _ ( 2009 ) , based on qualitative energy balance , which essentially repeats the same process in johnson s sinusoid @xmath33 , which for guduru s parameter becomes gives @xmath34 waters _",
    "( 2009 ) remark , correctly , that this condition only _ approximately _ estimates for which parameters the roughness is flattened and simply connected area is established spontaneously  that is , within the macroscopic contact area .",
    "returning to the actual guduru model of a spherical contact with sinusoidal waviness , it was nt necessary that the same parameter relative to the waviness in guduru s solution appeared , and indeed , _ it did not appear _ in guduru s solution , but only in its envelope from kesari s solution .",
    "assuming a simply connected area , the condition @xmath33 seems sufficient to guarantee that this solution is appropriate , but as we shall see , enhancement is this region is relatively low , and instead , surprisingly , the largest enhancement occurs for low @xmath20 .",
    "we can estimate the actual `` radius of spontaneous contact '' therefore precisely from the full guduru solution , and indeed also approximately from kesari s solution .",
    "it would seem that @xmath33 shows an important transition too : the loading curve envelope becomes hertzian for this value , and `` less than hertzian '' for lower values @xmath35 , which in contrast would be the values where the enhancement of pull - off load would be even more than 4 .",
    "in particular , an effective energy on loading and unloading , respectively , can be defined as @xmath36 where we have left the square root for @xmath37 to take into account that for @xmath38 , @xmath39 should be negative .",
    "notice that for the kesari expansion to be valid , one needs @xmath40 therefore , for the condition at pull - off to be reasonably evaluated from this analysis , one needs in general _ low values of _ @xmath41 . in this limit",

    "the biggest enhancement would seem to occur , surprisingly perhaps , at low values of @xmath20 , when the value of pull - off in dimensional terms would seem to be @xmath63 which no longer depends on surface energy and seems instead to be related to elastic modulus alone and geometrical quantities .",

    "this limit does not have much sense but it is interesting to remark that , while it is easy to understand why the uniform pressure shape of a contact could lead to theoretical strength in the contact ( gao & yao , 2004 ) , although this limit is sensitive to shape at large sizes , here we seem to reach very high adhesion limits with a spherical contact , of very large size , adding roughness , which normally is instead considered to be a detrimental factor .",
    "clearly , there must be a limit when roughness separates the contact into multiply connected areas : in that region , pull - off enhancement may still be possible if a contact splitting effect prevails over the effect of competing elastic deformation of the asperities at different heights as distributed over the spherical shape .",

    "notice we can actually switch to reduction instead of enhancement for large @xmath19 , but this is due , as noticed by guduru ( 2007 ) , to the fact that in the limit of very large wavelength ( which is also large @xmath19 ) , we have essentially only one contact at separation , that obtained the sphere with just the central crest of the wavy surface , having a reduced equivalent radius @xmath73 if we consider the pull - off value with this reduced radius , this leads to @xmath74 @xmath75 which goes to 1 both for large @xmath19 and large @xmath76  as it is clear from fig.5 .    combinations of large @xmath19 and small @xmath76  shows this reduction is not too large .",

    "guduru ( 2007 ) has a very preliminary discussion about the validity of the assumption of simply connected contact area , as for the case of non - adhesive contact , it can be cast very clearly in terms of the parameter @xmath78 . in particular , to have the gap function monotonically increasing , it is enough to have@xmath79 or@xmath80    hence , at low @xmath20 enhancement in the guduru - kesari model can only hold if @xmath19 is large , as otherwise separation in the contact may well occur . as we are interested in the range @xmath35 , the restriction on the shape requires @xmath81 or larger : however , this conflicts with the approximation in kesari s envelope , so that in fact the enhancement should be computed from the full guduru s equation , and the actual minimum of the curve is now much less than what expected from the envelope .",

    "this is important as we know from that analysis , that once in full contact , there is little chance to return to separated contact ( johnson ( 1995 ) has to postulate a flaw at the interface , or else there is theoretical strength as the only possible limit ) , other than from the contact edge .",

    "we could convince ourselves that the waviness has been squashed out mechanically if the local pressure is positive .",

    "we have revisited the guduru model , and discussed the possible reasons for the limitation of the very high enhancement of adhesion found in that model . in particular , we have observed a reduced dependence on the parameters , we have identified the johnson parameter for single sinusoidal contact to govern also the amplification of adhesion , at least in an asymptotic regime where the envelope solution by kesari et al holds .",
    "finally , we have shown that , as very large amplification is expected from the guduru model , even greater reduction is expected in the separated contact regime , as estimated from a rigid model adhesion equation by rumpf and rabinovich .",
    "the latter gives perhaps the lower bound of the adhesion , as guduru gives the upper bound .",

    "<S> while adhesion reduction due to roughness is not surprising , roughness induced adhesion remained a puzzle until recently guduru and coworkers have shown a very convincing mechanism to explain both the increase of strength and of toughness in a sphere with concentric single scale of waviness . </S>",

    "<S> counterintuitively _ , it leads to unbounded enhancement for conditions of large roughness for which johnson parameter is very low . </S>",
    "<S> guduru postulated that this enhancement should occur after sufficiently large pressure has been applied to any spherical contact . </S>",
    "<S> also , that although the enhancement is limited to the jkr regime of large soft materials with high adhesion , the dmt limit for the smooth sphere is found otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> however , for hard materials , even the dmt limit for the smooth solids is very hard to observe , which suggest that also adhesion reduction is yet not well understood .    </S>",
    "<S> the limitations of the assumption of simply connected area is here further discussed , and a well known model for hard particles in contact with rough planes due to  rumpf is used to show that in the range where unbounded increase is predicted , orders of magnitude reduction is instead expected for rigid solids . </S>",
