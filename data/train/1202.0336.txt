    "one of the advantages of superspace is that it makes supersymmetry manifest .",
    "any action which is invariant under arbitrary diffeomorphisms of curved superspace automatically yields a locally supersymmetric component action .",
    "in addition , it offers the possibility to construct general couplings from lagrangians of ( essentially ) arbitrary functional form . for these reasons , higher derivative supersymmetric actions , especially those coupled to supergravity , can be quite efficiently constructed in superspace .",
    "such actions have been of interest recently @xcite .",
    "we review below a new class of higher derivative actions that was constructed directly in superspace in our recent paper @xcite .",
    "the supergeometry which enables this construction is an off - shell formulation for general @xmath0 supergravity - matter couplings in four dimensions @xcite , which allows a curved - space extension of @xmath0 projective superspace @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the relevant detail is that the required superspace is @xmath1 .",
    "the curved supermanifold @xmath2 is parametrized by local coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "its geometry is described by covariant derivatives @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the supervielbein ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the lorentz generators and superconnections respectively ; and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the @xmath11 generators and superconnections",
    ". the auxiliary manifold @xmath12 is parametrized by an isotwistor @xmath13 defined modulo @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "all superfields and operators are required to have fixed homogeneity in @xmath16 . for a more extensive discussion of the supergeometry",
    ", we refer the reader to the original references @xcite .",
    "our higher derivative construction is based on a duality between two basic off - shell representations of @xmath0 supersymmetry  the tensor multiplet and the vector multiplet . in curved superspace",
    ", the tensor multiplet is described by its field strength @xmath17 , which is a real isotriplet superfield , @xmath18 , constrained to obey @xmath19 .",
    "these conditions are solved in terms of an unconstrained chiral prepotential @xmath20 , @xmath21 , as @xmath22 the superfield @xmath23 and its conjugate @xmath24 are components of the superspace torsion tensor .",
    "the superspace torsion and the algebra of covariant derivatives are given in @xcite .",
    "the vector multiplet , on the other hand , is described by its field strength @xmath25 , which is a chiral superfield , @xmath26 , obeying the bianchi identity @xmath27 such a superfield is called reduced chiral . comparing this equation to ,",
    "it is obvious that the superfield @xmath28 is a _",
    "tensor multiplet .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the tensor prepotential @xmath20 is defined only up to shifts @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a reduced chiral superfield .",
    "this is just the superfield version of the component gauge transformation @xmath31}$ ] which leaves the three - form field strength @xmath32}$ ] invariant .    within the projective superspace formulation of conformal supergravity @xcite ,",
    "both of these multiplets find a natural realization .",
    "the tensor multiplet is described in terms of a real @xmath33 multiplet @xmath34 obeying @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the vector multiplet can be described by a tropical prepotential @xmath38 , which is a real projective multiplet , @xmath39 , of weight zero , @xmath40 .",
    "the reduced chiral superfield @xmath25 is related to @xmath38 by @xmath41 the fixed isotwistor @xmath42 introduced here is subject only to the condition that @xmath43 along the contour @xmath44 in @xmath12 ; the construction proves to be independent of the choice of @xmath42 .",
    "the complementary nature of these properties allows us to generate tensor multiplets from vector multiplets and vice - versa .",
    "consider a system of @xmath45 abelian vector multiplets with field strengths @xmath46 , @xmath47 . given a holomorphic homogeneous function @xmath48 of degree one ( to guarantee the correct super - weyl transformation of @xmath49 )",
    ", we can define a composite tensor multiplet @xmath50 this is a standard construction and a trivial application of using the chiral function @xmath51 as a composite tensor prepotential .",
    "conversely , we may take a system of @xmath52 tensor multiplets described by their field strengths @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the corresponding @xmath33 multiplets .",
    "we may similarly construct a composite vector prepotential from any function @xmath56 that is real and homogeneous of degree zero . applying leads immediately to a composite field strength @xmath57 , @xmath58    these two observations together enable us to take any action involving tensor and/or vector multiplets and convert it to a higher derivative action by identifying one or both multiplets as composite .",
    "iterating the procedure leads to increasingly complex higher derivative interactions .",
    "we first demonstrate how this procedure allows the construction of general two - derivative interactions of tensor multiplets ; then we extend to two - derivative interactions of real @xmath59 multiplets ; and then finally we extend the argument to higher derivative theories .",
    "consider the simplest interaction between vector and tensor multiplets : the supersymmetric @xmath60 coupling .",
    "this action can be written either as a chiral superspace integral involving the tensor prepotential @xmath20 and vector field strength @xmath25 , @xmath61 or as a projective superspace integral involving the tensor field strength @xmath62 and the vector prepotential @xmath38 , @xmath63 this action is topological and involves no propagating degrees of freedom ; however , by identifying one or both multiplets as composite , we may construct nontrivial actions .",
    "for example , the unique superconformal action for a single tensor multiplet , known as the improved tensor multiplet action @xcite , can be written in either form . in projective superspace , it is given by where @xmath38 is replaced by the composite vector prepotential @xmath64 .",
    "the arctic multiplet @xmath65 appearing here can be shown to be a pure gauge degree of freedom .",
    "equivalently , the action is given by with the corresponding replacement @xmath66 .",
    "this form is simplest to use in principle since the techniques to evaluate the superspace integral are well known : we simply require @xmath57 . to construct it",
    ", we must evaluate the contour integral in .",
    "the way this is usually done is to make a choice for @xmath42 and then to evaluate the contour explicitly , _",
    "e.g. _ by representing @xmath67 .",
    "this breaks manifest @xmath11 covariance .",
    "it is possible , however , to keep @xmath11 covariance along the way @xcite .",
    "one does this by first evaluating the spinor derivatives on their argument and exploiting the contour integral to rewrite the integrand as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this has the advantage that all dependence on the auxiliary isotwistor @xmath42 has vanished .",
    "the remaining contour integral can be done in an @xmath11 covariant way @xcite , with the result recast as @xmath71 it is remarkable that this expression is chiral and obeys .",
    "( an equivalent but less compact expression for @xmath57 , obtained by brute force , was given in @xcite . )",
    "superconformal actions involving several tensor multiplets can be written in an analogous fashion . in projective superspace , they are given by a general real weight - two projective lagrangian @xmath72 which is homogeneous of degree - one .",
    "such a lagrangian can always be rewritten ( though not uniquely ) as @xmath73 the corresponding projective superspace action can then be converted into a chiral action analogous to , @xmath74 with @xmath75 given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are functions of @xmath79 given by @xmath80 this construction appeared originally in flat superspace @xcite .",
    "its component form coupled to conformal supergravity appeared in @xcite .",
    "we may extend the above procedure by considering @xmath59 multiplets . as an example , consider a more general projective lagrangian of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a real @xmath59 multiplet obeying @xmath83 the composite vector multiplet we construct from the above expression has the prepotential @xmath84 .",
    "as before , it is possible to evaluate the spinor derivatives in such a way as to completely eliminate the auxiliary isotwistor @xmath42 . the contour integral can then be evaluated in an @xmath11 covariant way and the result recast as @xmath85 where @xmath86    an interesting application of this result is for the case @xmath87 with the lagrangian @xmath88 . this is a curved - superspace version of that proposed in @xcite to describe the classical universal hypermultiplet @xcite . applying our general formula leads to @xmath89 the construction of the component lagrangian",
    "can then be carried out by conventional means .",
    "we now turn to our main goal : the construction of higher derivative actions .",
    "this can be done quite straightforwardly by iterating the above procedure . begin with a set of tensor multiplets @xmath79 and abelian vector multiplets @xmath46 .",
    "we construct a set of degree - zero functions @xmath90 of the tensor multiplets @xmath91 , which lead to the composite vector multiplet field strengths @xmath92 using both sets of vector multiplets , we introduce a set of degree - one holomorphic functions @xmath93 which can be used to construct composite tensor multiplet field strengths @xmath94 then we may introduce these composite tensor multiplets into the functions @xmath90 in , leading to @xmath95 this new vector multiplet can be used to construct new composite tensor multiplets and so on and so forth , with each iteration adding two spinor derivatives ( or one vector derivative ) to the interaction .",
    "this method of constructing higher derivative actions should be contrasted with the more traditional way of generating higher derivative structures using the chiral projection operator @xmath96 , which is a curved space generalization of @xmath97 . given any scalar superfield @xmath98 which is inert under super - weyl transformations , its descendant @xmath99 is chiral and super - weyl weight two . given a vector multiplet @xmath25 that is nowhere vanishing",
    ", we can then define the chiral scalar @xmath100 which is invariant under the super - weyl transformations .",
    "we can then construct @xmath101 , and so on and so forth .. ]    using these composite chiral operators , one may construct higher derivative actions involving chiral superspace actions . however , it is usually possible to convert the chiral superspace action into an integral over the whole superspace by eliminating one of the chiral projection operators .",
    "schematically , if @xmath102 for some chiral superfield @xmath103 and a well - defined local and gauge - invariant operator @xmath104 , then @xmath105 thus , higher derivative actions of this type are invariably most naturally written as integrals over the entire superspace and are not intrinsically chiral .",
    "this has important ramifications for perturbative calculations , where non - renormalization theorems place strong restrictions on intrinsic chiral lagrangians .",
    "the constructions we are considering are interesting partly because they include higher derivative terms which _ can not _ be written as full superspace integrals without introducing prepotentials .",
    "we take the example of a projective lagrangian @xmath106 of several tensor multiplets @xmath91 and one composite tensor multiplet @xmath107 the action can be rewritten @xmath108 which is a special case of a more general action @xmath109 the complex integrand @xmath110 is required to be annihilated by only 1/4 of the spinor derivatives .",
    "such an action is the locally supersymmetric version of @xmath111 in other words , it is an integral over 3/4 of the grassmann coordinates of superspace .",
    "supersymmetric yang - mills effective actions , which are given as an integral over 3/4 of superspace , have been discussed in @xcite . ] because this class of higher derivative action can not be written as an integral over the full superspace without introducing gauge - dependent prepotentials , an @xmath0 extension of the well known @xmath112 non - renormalization theorems likely applies .    in order for the action to be super - weyl invariant ,",
    "@xmath110 must be degree 1 in @xmath46 and degree zero in @xmath91 .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "( in this case , the arctic multiplets are again pure gauge degrees of freedom . )",
    "a straightforward argument shows that the action can be rewritten @xmath115 which is the supersymmetric generalization of @xmath116 thus the actions describe three - derivative couplings in the bosonic sector .",
    "needless to say , the integrand @xmath110 can be generalized to include composite vector and tensor multiplets , which leads to four - derivative and higher interactions .    for simplicity",
    "we have restricted our higher - derivative discussion to vector and tensor multiplets . however , as emphasized in @xcite , the composite vector multiplets may be built out of not only tensor multiplets , but also more general @xmath59 multiplets and even polar multiplets .",
    "the corresponding chiral superspace action can then be used to give a new and very general class of higher - derivative supergravity - matter couplings .",
