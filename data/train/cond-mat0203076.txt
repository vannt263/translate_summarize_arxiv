    "we do not understand the substantial increase of the q - independent scattering with decreasing temperature amounting to 300 counts at 70 k and 1300 counts at 290 k. in the context of the @xmath3300 k transition seen in other samples , this might signify the growth below room temperature of a broad peak that extends over much of the brillouin zone and can not be resolved from the background .",
    "it would correspond to highly localized correlations .    to establish an improved limit on the maximum magnetic moment to which our experiment is sensitive we put our measurements on an absolute scale .",
    "we calculated our sensitivity in terms of what moment would produce an intensity corresponding to the average of the error bars in the fig .",
    "3 scan through ( 1/2 1/2 2 ) . to do this",
    "we assumed an antiferromagnetically ordered array of cu@xmath9 moments pointing along the _ a * _ direction ( different directions in the a - b plane give a qualitatively similar estimate ) .",
    "we compared the average error bar with the integrated intensity of the h - scan through ( 3/2 0 0 ) and the rock scan through ( 1 1 2 ) .",
    "these two peaks are ideal for normalization since they have weak structure factors and should not be subject to extinction .",
    "these independent methods test the reliability of our estimate , since the h - scan through ( 3/2 0 0 ) requires knowledge of the instrumental resolution , while the rocking scan through ( 1 1 2 ) does not , as shown by cowley and bates .  @xcite we can conclude that our sensitivity is such that we could have detected any static moment greater than @xmath3 0.003 @xmath4 .",
    "this is approximately an order of magnitude less than the moments reported in other experiments  @xcite .",
    "we have also forced a weak gaussian , with the calculated resolution width , to go through the 13 k data ( fig .",
    "3 ) and reached a similar conclusion - moments of the size observed in these experiments do not occur in well - ordered ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "although we find no static peak we have searched for other signatures of orbital magnetism . for example , the ddw theory requires an opening of a gap in the spin spectrum well above t@xmath33 .",
    "@xcite for this reason it is claimed that the reported spin gaps @xmath3 20 mev for ybco@xmath10 and @xmath3 16 mev for ybco@xmath2 , are a confirmation of the ddw theory . however , these are superconducting , not normal - phase gaps , since they were derived by subtracting the spin correlation data above t@xmath33 from that below t@xmath33 .",
    "in contrast there is no evidence for a spin gap in disordered ybco@xmath2 in its normal phase obtained by fong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite or bourges _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the presence of a gap would be a key piece of evidence that the orbital currents of the ddw had broken a discrete symmetry below a sharp phase transition temperature , we made careful q - scans in the low - energy regime to establish whether a spin gap had occurred in the presence of oxygen order .",
    "previous polarized neutron experiments have shown that the q - correlated peak near ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) is magnetic ,  @xcite and we have confirmed this from its form factor and temperature dependence .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig 4 , our experiments provide compelling evidence that a q - correlated signal near ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) persists to the lowest energies .",
    "@xcite in particular , it exists in the normal phase for energies well below 20 mev and is still seen at energies as low as @xmath3 6 mev in the normal phase .",
    "its spectral weight declines roughly with e at low energies .",
    "we conclude that there is no normal state spin gap for ybco@xmath2 ortho - ii .",
    "[ t ]     our observation that spin fluctuations persist to low energies in ortho - ii ordered yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath7 with @xmath34 agrees with the absence of a gap  @xcite in disordered samples with _",
    "_ x__=0.5 and 0.52 .",
    "relative to these disordered crystals with similar doping but lower t@xmath33 , the low - energy susceptibility in the ortho - ii crystal is more highly suppressed relative to the resonance .",
    "our results are also consistent with those of chou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for disordered , twinned ybco@xmath2 . our higher resolution and more ordered crystal now reveals the flat topped correlations in fig 4 , indicative of the incommensurate structure of the ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) peak , to be described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite otherwise the measured spin response is similar to that of chou _",
    "et al_. the overdamped spin - wave model  @xcite ( curves in figure 4 ) convolved with the instrumental resolution gives a reasonable description of the data .",
    "the presence of low - energy spin correlations is not consistent a fully developed spin gap .",
    "this makes it unlikely that a new phase has been entered in which the discrete symmetry of the the ising - like ddw order parameter has been broken .",
    "in disordered ybco the spin fluctuations in ybco with oxygen concentrations between 6.4 and 6.5 weaken with hole doping away from the antiferromagnetic phase and suddenly drop in strength when _ x _ reaches 0.5 , concomitant with the growth of the orthorhombic and oxygen chain structure .",
    "@xcite for ordered ortho - ii with @xmath34 , we find the spin fluctuations are quite similar being suppressed but not eliminated .    the sample of ybco@xmath10 used in ref .   has oxygen ordering correlation lengths comparable to ours by comparison of the peak widths .",
    "@xcite however the extra oxygen must find a way into the lattice and interrupt the perfect 2__a _ _ by 1__b _ _ cell of the ortho - ii structure .",
    "the sample of ref . has shorter oxygen correlation lengths of 20   in the _ a - b _ plane and 12   along the _ c _ direction .",
    "these are shorter than in our sample , which exhibits nearly resolution limited superlattice peaks indicating oxygen order over more than @xmath35   within the cuo@xmath0 plane and 50   normal to the planes .",
    "this might suggest that disorder causing the proximity of adjacent short segments of chains filled with oxygen could lead to magnetic order .",
    "the idea that disorder may induce long - range antiferromagnetic order is not new .",
    "recent examples include mg doped cugeo@xmath1 which exhibits long - range antiferromagnetic order for finite mg concentration .",
    "@xcite also hodges _ et al . _",
    "@xcite added only @xmath36 of co to optimally doped ybco and found long - range antiferromagnetic order below a large temperature , t = 320 k , quite similar to the onset of elastic peaks in refs .   and  .",
    "they suggest this impurity effect is analogous to the order seen by sidis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in underdoped ybco .",
    "the latter example is particularly interesting as co is known to enter into the copper chains and pull into the structure 0.5 oxygen atoms per co atom , therefore introducing disorder into the chains  @xcite .",
    "a number of theories describing the effect of disorder and impurities have been formulated .",
    "@xcite in the ginsburg - landau analysis by kohno _ _ et al.__@xcite disorder in a region can weaken the superconducting order and allow antiferromagnetic correlations to grow locally .",
    "with increasing disorder or impurity concentration the superconducting state will be transformed first into a state with locally nucleated antiferromagnetic moments and later into a state of long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we believe our results represent the former state of weak disorder where there is coexistence of moderately suppressed superconductivity with only short - range magnetic order .",
    "systems where a phase has been found below a well - defined transition temperature and where a sharp ddw peak occurs , might then lie in the latter region ; here the nature of the disorder creates long - range magnetic order while more strongly suppressing superconductivity .",
    "we are therefore closer to the clean system referred to by kohno _",
    "et al_.    it is possible that ortho - ii ybco@xmath2 lies in the phase diagram at an oxygen doping where the low - energy spin susceptibility , being the sub - critical fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point , is strongly suppressed by the growth of orbital current fluctuations . however , there is no occurrence of static ddw order at a sharp temperature accompanied by a spin gap .",

    "this idea receives support in the recent work of lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who propose that the pseudogap state is not characterized by a phase transition but by a cross - over to a state with strong fluctuations between orbital currents and d - wave superconductivity .",
    "static antiferromagnetic long - range correlations that would produce a peak at ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 ) are absent in ybco6.5 in its ortho - ii structure at a level that represents our magnetic moment sensitivity of 0.003 @xmath4 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of the elastic peaks reported in underdoped cuprate superconductors with somewhat different oxygen doping and/or order .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that a broad peak may exist with extremely short - range ddw correlations .",
    "the generic phase diagram  @xcite , may allow ybco at larger doping such as o@xmath10 to lie in the ddw phase while o@xmath2 does not .",
