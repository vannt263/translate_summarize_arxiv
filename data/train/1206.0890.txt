    "the studies of simple micro - swimmers ( or micro - robots ) represent a flourishing modern research topic ( see @xcite ) , which creates the fundamental base for modern applications in medicine and other areas . in this paper",
    "we generalize the three - sphere micro - swimmer by @xcite to the general @xmath0-sphere micro - swimmer .",
    "it is possible since the employed two - timing method and a distinguished limit significantly simplifies the analytical procedure .",
    "we consider a micro - swimmer consisting of @xmath0 rigid spheres of radii @xmath1 , @xmath2 with their centers at the points @xmath3 of the @xmath4-axis ( @xmath5 ) ; @xmath6 is time .",
    "the spheres are connected by @xmath7 rods of lengths @xmath8 where our choice is always @xmath9 .",
    "the masses of the spheres and the rods ( in the stokes approximation ) are zero .",
    "the rods are so thin that their interaction with a fluid is negligible .",
    "the lengths of the rods are prescribed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the averaged values and @xmath12 are the oscillations , which are prescribed as @xmath13-periodic functions of @xmath14 with a constant frequency @xmath15 .",
    "asterisks mark dimensional variables and parameters .    in the stokes approximation",
    "the total force acting on each sphere is zero ( their masses are zero ) , hence the equation of motion for the @xmath16-th sphere can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is viscosity , dots above the functions stands for @xmath20 . the l.h.s .",
    "of ( [ exact-1 ] ) represents a viscous friction , while @xmath21 is the force exerted by the rods to the @xmath16-th sphere . in order to derive ( [ exact-1 ] ) we have used the fact ( see @xcite ) that a sphere of radius @xmath22 and position @xmath23 moving along the @xmath4-axis with velocity @xmath24 creates at the center of @xmath16-th sphere the @xmath4-component of fluid velocity equal to @xmath25 , where the minus sign corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "the considered mechanical system is a closed one , hence the total force exerted by the constraints is zero : @xmath27 eqns .",
    "( [ exact-1]),([exact-1a ] ) represent the system of odes to be solved in this paper .",
    "notice that we do not use the summation convention .",
    "the equation ( [ exact-1 ] ) and its solution @xmath28 , contain three characteristic lengths : the radius @xmath29 of spheres , the distance @xmath30 between the neighbouring spheres , and the amplitude @xmath31 of oscillations of rod lengths ; at the same time the only explicit characteristic time - scale @xmath32 corresponds to the frequency @xmath15 : @xmath33 the dimensionless variables and small parameters are @xmath34 then the dimensionless eqns.([constraint])-([exact-1a ] ) take the form @xmath35 one should note that ` dots ' above function in ( [ exact-1 ] ) and ( [ exact-1-dless ] ) correspond to the dimensional and dimensionless time derivatives correspondingly .",
    "the first equation ( [ exact-1-dless ] ) can be rewritten in the matrix form @xmath36 -\\delta r_{ik}/l_{ik } & \\text { for } \\",

    "we use the following definitions and notations : ( i ) a dimensionless function @xmath41 belongs to the class @xmath42 if @xmath43 and all partial @xmath39- , and @xmath40-derivatives of @xmath44 ( required for our consideration ) are also @xmath45 . in this paper",
    "all small parameters appear as explicit multipliers , while all functions always belong to @xmath42-class .",
    "\\(ii ) we consider only _ periodically oscillating in @xmath40 functions _ @xmath46 where the @xmath39-dependence is not specified . hence @xmath47 .",
    "\\(iii ) the subscripts @xmath40 and @xmath39 denote the related partial derivatives .",
    "\\(iv ) for an arbitrary @xmath48 the _ averaging operation _ is @xmath49 where during the integration we keep @xmath50 and @xmath51 does not depend on @xmath52 .",
    "\\(v ) the class of _ tilde - functions _",
    "( or purely oscillating functions ) is such that @xmath53 tilde - functions represent a special case of @xmath54-functions with zero average .",
    "\\(vi ) the class of _ bar - functions _",
    "( or mean - functions ) is defined as @xmath55",
    "the use of @xmath56-dependence of @xmath57 ( [ constraint ] ) leads to the presentation of matrix @xmath58 ( [ matrixa ] ) as a series for @xmath59 ( we consider @xmath60 as a fixed parameter ) @xmath61 r_{ik}\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{ik}/l_{ik}^2 & \\text{for}\\ i\\neq k \\end{cases}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we do not present the expression for @xmath62 since it will not affect the answer .",
    "the crucial step of our procedure is the introduction of a fast time variable @xmath40 and a slow time variable @xmath39 .",
    "we take @xmath63 ( which corresponds to the prescribed oscillations of the rods ) and @xmath64 .",
    "this choice of @xmath39 can be justified by the same distinguished limit arguments as in @xcite ; here we present this fact without proof , referring only to the most important fact that it leads to a valid asymptotic procedure .",
    "therefore we use the chain rule @xmath65 and then we accept ( temporarily ) that @xmath40 and @xmath39 represent two independent variables .",
    "the two - timing form of eqn .",
    "( [ exact-1-dless - matrix ] ) is @xmath66 where unknown functions are taken as the series @xmath67 the accepted condition @xmath68 reflects the fact that the large distances of self - swimming are driven by small self - oscillations .",
    "now we consider the successive approximations of ( [ exact-1-dless - matrix - ser]),([x - f - ser ] ) in @xmath56 :    \\(i ) _ terms _ @xmath69 give @xmath70 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ terms _ @xmath71 give @xmath72 ; the averaged part of this equation gives @xmath73 , while the oscillating part yields @xmath74    \\(iii ) _ terms _ @xmath75 give the equation @xmath76 ; its averaged part is @xmath77 the force @xmath78 can be excluded from ( [ two - aver ] ) by ( [ exact-1aa ] ) : @xmath79 the self - propulsion with averaged velocity @xmath80 means that @xmath81 , hence @xmath82 where the matrix @xmath83 is replaced with @xmath84 since we consider only the main ( linear ) term in @xmath60 .",
    "expression ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) still contains unknown functions @xmath85 which can be determined from ( [ one - tilde ] ) with the use of constrains ( [ constraint - less]),([exact-1aa ] ) .",
    "indeed , the equation ( [ one - tilde ] ) ( with linear in @xmath60 precision ) gives @xmath86 with @xmath87 ; it means that @xmath88 with the components @xmath89 .",
    "one can see that ( [ constraint - less ] ) yields @xmath90 , while ( [ exact-1aa ] ) leads to @xmath91 .",
    "both these restrictions can be written as one @xmath92 matrix equation @xmath93 the substitution of @xmath94 into ( [ vel - self - prop ] ) gives us self - propulsion velocity in the matrix form @xmath95 where the matrix @xmath96 is @xmath97 further calculations show that ( [ vel - self - prop - final ] ) can be presented as @xmath98 where the sum is taken over all possible triplets @xmath99 . for the three - swimmer",
    "this sum contains the only term , which coincides with one by @xcite . in general",
    "it contains @xmath100 $ ] terms : for the four - swimmer we already have four triplets @xmath101 , for the five - swimmer  10 terms , while for the ten - swimmer the number of triplets grows up to 120 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath96 ( [ m-1 ] ) and @xmath80 ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) have been obtained by the explicit calculations for @xmath102 and by the mathematical induction for any @xmath0 .",
    "formula ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) represents the main result of this paper . according to ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) @xmath103 ; however physical velocity is @xmath104 .",
    "hence the order of magnitude of the dimensionless physical velocity is @xmath105 .",
    "\\1 . the explicit formula ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) allows one to find the optimal strokes , to calculate the required power , the efficiency of self - swimming , and all related forces ( both oscillatory and averaged ) . however the large number of terms in ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) makes all these problems rather cumbersome , and places them out of the scope of this short paper .",
    "\\2 . our approach ( based on the two - timing method and distinguished limit ) is technically different from all previous studies in this area .",
    "the results for @xmath0-sphere swimmer show its analytical strength .",
    "\\3 . the expression ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] )",
    "can be predicted without any calculations , on the base of the result for @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , if we are interested in the main term of the order @xmath107 , then only the triple interactions can be taken into account , as they have been described by @xcite .",
    "the additional ( to triplets ) interactions between four spheres will inevitably produce the next order term @xmath108 , which we do not consider .",
    "there are some interesting discussions about the physical mechanism of self - propulsion in the quoted literature .",
    "however one can also notice that a similar result does exist for self - propulsion in an inviscid fluid ( @xcite ) and some physical explanation can be achieved if we replace the term ` virtual mass of a dumbbell ' by the term ` viscous drag coefficient of a dumbbell ' .",
    "say , for a three - sphere swimmer this coefficient decreases when the distance between two neighbouring spheres ( a dumbbell ) decreases and then the third sphere is used to ` push ' or ` pull ' .",
    "if the reverse motion of the third sphere meets the increased drag coefficient of the dumbbell , then self - propulsion is achieved .",
    "one can also derive the higher approximations of self - propulsion velocity , as it has been done by @xcite",
    ". they can be especially useful for the studies of motion with @xmath109 ( say , if all correlations involved to ( [ vel - self - prop - final+ ] ) are zero ) . in this case",
    "one can show that self - propulsion can be generated by interactions of four and more spheres .",
    "\\7 . in this paper",
    "we consider only periodic oscillations of constraints .",
    "the studies of non - periodic oscillations might represent an interesting problem .",
    "an attempt in this direction have been made by @xcite .",
    "in fact , such generalizations have been already considered for many different oscillating systems ."
