    "high precision synchronization of clocks plays an important role in modern society and scientific research @xcite ; examples include navigation , global positioning , tests of general relativity theory , long baseline interferometry in radio astronomy , as well as gravitational wave observation .",
    "two standard classical protocols for clock synchronization are einstein s synchronization scheme @xcite and eddington s slow clock transfer @xcite .",
    "the former requires operational exchange of light pulses between the distant clocks and the latter is based on sending a locally synchronized clock from one part to other parts .",
    "recently , quantum strategies have been exploited to improve the accuracy of clock synchronization . a few quantum clock synchronization ( qcs ) proposals @xcite and experiments",
    "@xcite are reported .",
    "it is shown that the schemes based on quantum mechanics can gain significant improvements in precision over their classical counterparts .",
    "the main idea in most of the qcs proposals is employing quantum entanglement and state squeezing to achieve an enhancement of the precision .",
    "on one hand several satellite - based quantum optics experiences @xcite are feasible with current technology , such as satellite quantum communication @xcite , and quantum tagging @xcite , as well as gravity probes using beam interferometers @xcite and atomic clocks @xcite to test the principle of equivalence . among these experiments ,",
    "the synchronization of clocks between a satellite and a ground station @xcite is an essential step .",
    "the global positioning system ( gps ) with synchronized clocks is a satellite - based navigation system .",
    "there are growing needs to advance this system with higher accuracy for military , civil and commercial reasons , and also for fundamental research such as in searching dark matter @xcite .",
    "time signals transferred by optical technology @xcite may be necessary to meet the demanding of precision.besides , a satellite - based quantum network of clocks is promising to act as a single world clock with unprecedented stability and accuracy approaching the limit set by quantum mechanics , and there is also a security advantage @xcite . on the other hand , the feasibility for satellite - based qcs has to be concerned and time dilation @xcite is a concern because of relativistic effects of the earth on the qcs .",
    "the influence of relativistic effects on quantum systems @xcite is a focus of study in recent years because such studies provide insights into some key questions in quantum mechanics and relativity , such as nonlocality , causality , and the information paradox of black holes .",
    "relativistic effects are particularly significant for the quantum versions of the eddington scheme @xcite because one must assume that the transfer is performed `` adiabatically slowly '' @xcite and the spacetime is flat such that relativistic effects are negligible .",
    "it is demonstrated experimentally that the gravitational frequency shift ( gfs ) effects remarkably influence the running of current atomic clockshowever , time dilation induced by earth s spacetime curvature is experimentally observed for a change in height of @xmath0 m @xcite and thus can not be neglected .    in this paper",
    "we propose a practical scheme for satellite - based qcs .",
    "we let two observers , alice and bob , exchange two frequency entangled pulses between a ground station and a satellite .",
    "the influence of gravitational red - shift on the frequency of a pulse can be eliminated by an opposite gravitational blue - shift . by assuming the clocks have the same precision @xcite , clock synchronization",
    "can be realized by identifying the time discrepancies . in our scheme ,",
    "the time discrepancies are introduced through adding or subtracting optical path differences into the pulses and the coincidence rate of the pulses in the interferometer as a function of the time discrepancy between the clocks is measured . in actual satellite - based quantum information processing tasks",
    "@xcite , and similarly in protocols of qcs , the main errors are induced by photon - loss and the dispersion effects of the atmosphere through which the pulses travel .",
    "therefore , we employ frequency entangled light , instead of the entangled n00n state which is vulnerable for photon - loss @xcite , as well as the dispersion cancellation technology @xcite to eliminate the influence of the atmospheric scattering .",
    "we find that the coincidence rate of interferometry is remarkably affected by the spacetime curvature of the earth .",
    "we also find that the precision of the clock synchronization is sensitive to the light source parameters . by using this quantum scheme",
    ", we can reach a high accuracy for clock synchronization .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the sketch of the experimental setup . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss how the earth s spacetime effects the propagation of photons . in sec .",
    "iv we study the feasibility of satellite - based qcs and how the effect of the earth s gravity will disturb it . in the last section we discuss the experimental feasibility of our scheme and give a brief summary .",
    "the sketch of our proposal for satellite - based qcs is described in fig .",
    "( [ f : experiment ] ) .",
    "the quantum optical technology of our proposal is based on the hong , ou , and mandel ( hom ) interferometer @xcite .",
    "we assume that alice works on the surface of the earth ( @xmath1 ) with her own clock , while bob works on a satellite at constant radius @xmath2 .",
    "the clocks have the same accuracy thus the clock synchronization problem is reduced to the problem of identifying the time discrepancy between the clocks .",
    "alice s clock has been synchronized with a standard clock but bob s clock dose not.alice sends two frequency entangled beams produced by a parametric down converter crystal ( pdc ) source to bob and bob bounces them back to alice again .",
    "those two pulses are named signal @xmath3 beam and idler @xmath4 beam , respectively . by exchanging entangled beams between alice and bob ,",
    "a  conveyor belt \" @xcite for time information is established . after propagating through different optical paths ,",
    "the signal and idler beams are interfered at the 50/50 beam splitter and be measured by the detectors . to introduce time information into the beams , alice and bob use moving mirrors with constant speed @xmath5 to add or subtract optical path differences ( opd ) to the beams @xcite .",
    "alice and bob come to an agreement on the starting time @xmath6 of their mirrors in advance .",
    "since they do not have a synchronized clock to start with , they can only start the mirrors at time @xmath7 relative to the time readings of their own clock , which are different due to different locations . as described in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , alice at the ground station start a moving mirror to _ add _ an opd @xmath8 to the idler beam @xcite and to _ subtract _ the same amount of opd @xmath9 from the signal beam which was bounced back from bob . at the satellite bob _",
    "subtracts _ an opd @xmath10 from the idler beam and _ adds _ an identical opd @xmath11 to the signal beam . the linear time dependent opds",
    "are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the starting times ( proper time ) as measured by alice s and bob s clocks , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ delayt ] ) @xmath15 is the time point ( coordinate time ) of the coincidence detection of the signal and idler photons , i.e. , the time when the photons quantum state is measured . by assuming the quantum state is instantaneously collapsed by the measurements made on the surface of the earth , we can agree that the collapsing time is identical @xmath16 , even if alice and bob reading times are different @xmath17 at this moment . from eq .",
    "( [ delayt ] ) we can see that the delays are proportional to the time interval between the starting time @xmath18 for the moving of the mirrors and the time @xmath15 when the photons are detected .",
    "if the proportionality constant @xmath5 in eq . ( [ delayt ] ) and the starting time reading @xmath18 on alice s and bob s clocks are identical , the quantity of opd at alice s point will be _ zero _ after an exchange period .",
    "therefore , the final opd is totally produced from the starting time discrepancy @xmath19 between alice s clock and bob s clock .",
    "then the signal and idler pulses are interfered at the beam splitter ( bs ) and click the detectors .",
    "we will show in section iv that the final difference of optical path lengths is affected by a factor depending on the starting time discrepancy @xmath20 . by measuring the photon coincidence rate @xmath21 at the output ports 1 and 2 of the beam splitter",
    ", one may acquire very precise information on the opd in the two arms .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to measure the photon coincidence rate to recover the exact time discrepancy between alice s clock and bob s clock . then alice tells bob by classical communication to adjust his clock according to the time discrepancy . by using this scheme",
    ", alice and bob may thus synchronize their clocks , andcheck how much the accuracy is disturbed by the gravity induced spacetime curvature of the earth , and inversely they can precisely measure the curvature via an atomic clock , which is the most accurate setup currently available in the world .",
    "now we describe the propagation of photons from the earth to a satellite by taking gravity of the earth into consideration .",
    "the earth s spacetime curvature will influence the light pulses during their propagation between the ground station and the satellite .",
    "we know that the earth rotates slowly with an angular velocity at the equator of @xmath22 or at a linear speed of @xmath23 , which is much slower than the speed of light . therefore , the schwarzschild metric @xcite is a sufficient approximation for the earth s spacetime , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the earth s schwarzschild radius , @xmath26 is the mass of the earth , @xmath27 is the speed of light in vacuo , and @xmath28 is the gravitational constant .",
    "alice and bob should move with constant acceleration to overcome the gravitational potential and to remain at a constant distance from the earth .",
    "we also assume that exchange of pulses are performed only when the satellite is just above the ground station .",
    "considering further the earth s schwarzschild radius is much smaller than its radius @xmath29 and the size of the optical source is small compared to the characteristic distances involved , we can consider only radial propagations @xcite .",
    "a photon can be properly modeled by a wave packet of electromagnetic fields @xcite with a distribution @xmath30 of modes peaked around the frequencies @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 labels either alice or bob .",
    "the annihilation operator for a photon from the point of view of alice or bob takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the physical frequencies as measured in their labs .",
    "the proper times @xmath35 are related to the schwarzschild coordinate time @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of photons satisfy @xmath38=\\delta(\\omega_k-\\omega^{'}_k)$ ] . at time",
    "@xmath39 alice prepares a wave packet @xmath40 and sends it to bob who will receive it at a different proper time @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath20 is propagation time of the wave packet , and the factor @xmath43 indicates the relativistic time dilation .",
    "the wave packet received is modified due to the spacetime curvature of the earth and takes the form @xmath44 .",
    "note that alice s and bob s operators can describe the _ same _ optical mode in two _ different _ frames before and after propagation @xcite.by employing the definition of proper time , it is easy to show that the time evolution for the modes has the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are the quantum states of the modes corresponding to the operators @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this equation indicates that the physical frequency @xmath34 measured by an observer at the position @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "then we find that bob will receive a mode with frequency @xmath50 if a sharp frequency mode with @xmath51 was sent by alice .",
    "this is the well - known gravitational red - shift effect , which was predicted by einstein in 1911 and experimentally verified in 1960 @xcite . in our scheme",
    "such a classical gravitational effect is designed to be eliminated by an opposite gravitational blueshift factor @xmath52 because the signal will be sent downward from a satellite to the earth .    now our task to find how the wave packet of a photon is transformed by its propagation from the ground to the satellite under spacetime curvature of the earth . as shown in @xcite , the relation between the annihilation operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 given in eq .",

    "assume that alice prepares a single photon in the mode @xmath40 which describes the state @xmath57 .",
    "bob will receive the distribution @xmath58 and the corresponding state is @xmath59 @xcite . regardless of the specific model of the detector that bob uses , if bob uses a measuring device which is tuned to click when a photon in the wave packet @xmath40 is received , the probability of the detector to click will be affected by the fact that he received a wave - packet @xmath44 bob will conclude that the channel between him and alice ( i.e. , the spacetime ) is noisy.the distortion of the photon s wave packet distribution due to the earth s spacetime curvature is nonlinear therefore can not be corrected by a linear shift of frequencies therefore _ can not _ be eliminated by the dispersion cancellation technology @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors found that such effect results in remarkable additional quantum bit error rates on the satellite - based quantum key distribution.however , such a nonlinear gravitational effect is found to influence the fidelity of the quantum channel between alice and bob @xcite and will inevitably affect the accuracy of the satellite - based qcs as well .",
    "the mode @xmath60 received by bob can be decomposed in terms of the mode @xmath61 prepared by alice and an orthogonal mode @xmath62",
    "@xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the wave packet overlap between the distributions @xmath58 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 which describes the fidelity of the channel between alice and bob . for a perfect channel",
    "one has @xmath67 .",
    "the emitted signal and idler beams from the pdc initially share an entangled state @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are creation operators of the first and the second photons , respectively . for a monochromatic pump this state",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the states for the signal and idler pulses , and the vacuum for all the other frequencies , and @xmath74 is the spectral distribution function of the down - converted photons @xcite .",
    "now let us briefly discuss how quantum entanglement is useful to quantum clock synchronization and the advantage of the quantum clock synchronization scheme .",
    "the main advantage of a quantum strategy is that we can employ quantum uncertainty and coherence time of the frequency entangled photons . from eq .",
    "( 7 ) we can see that although the sum frequency @xmath75 is certain , the down - shifted frequencies @xmath76 and @xmath77 are highly uncertain .",
    "the frequencies are largely determined by the pass bands of the interference filters that inserted in the down - shifted beams @xcite .",
    "these pass bands have been found on the order of @xmath78 hz , which corresponds to a coherence time for each photon on the order of 100 fs @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is able to measure a time interval of or better than the coherence time of the photons ( 50 fs ) , with an accuracy of 1 fs ( @xmath79 ) . also , the most important task for the quantum clock synchronization is to determine the time interval by measuring the rate at which photons are detected in coincidence , which relates to the coherence length of the photon wave packet and entanglement of the photons .    as stated before ,",
    "alice _ adds _ an opd @xmath8 to the idler beam @xcite and _ subtracts _ the same amount of opd @xmath9 from the signal beam which was bounced back from bob . at the satellite bob__subtracts _ _ an opd @xmath10 from the idler beam and _ adds _ an identical opd @xmath11 to the signal beam",
    ". then we let the pulses interfere at the 50/50 bs and be measured in the hom interferometer .",
    "the detected coincidence rate @xmath21 at the detectors is given by the mandel formula @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath15 is the interaction time of the detectors , and the electromagnetic fields at time @xmath81 at the output of the beam splitter can be defined by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the beam cross section , and @xmath84 is the position of the moving mirrors detector .",
    "the relationship between the output and input fields of the beam of the moving mirrors can be obtained by performing lorentz transformations on the input fields @xcite .",
    "for example , the factor @xmath85 after the beams outflow from the moving mirrors evolves to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the lorentz transformation factor , @xmath88 denotes the doppler shift introduced by the moving mirrors , and @xmath89 is the distance of the beam s delay . for the time delays defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we have @xmath90 for all @xmath91 .",
    "then the beams are sent from the earth to the satellite and are influenced by the dissipation of the atmosphere and the spacetime curvature .",
    "the former produces a phase discrepancy @xmath92 and the latter can be described by eq .",
    "( 5 ) . taking the signal beam as an example",
    ", the full procedure can be expressed by the transformations between the annihilation operators when the photons are sent from the earth to the satellite @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the wave packet overlap between the distributions when the pulse is sent from the earth to the satellite .",
    "we can see that the annihilation operator @xmath96 at alice s laboratory evolves into @xmath97 when observing at bob s laboratory , where @xmath98 is the distance between the earth and the satellite .",
    "again , the annihilation operator for the signal beam evolves into @xmath99 before entering the 50/50 bs @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 denotes the distance between bob and the bs , and @xmath104 is the mode overlap between the distributions when the pulse is received from the satellite . in eq .",
    "( [ doppsign1 ] ) the terms @xmath105 and @xmath106 describe the effect of the dispersive atmosphere on the signal beam on their way to and from the satellite , respectively .",
    "notice that the doppler shift introduced by the first mirror is @xmath107 and the frequency itself is revaluated at @xmath108 again because the second mirror moves in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "similarly , the effect of the gravitational redshift factor @xmath109 on the frequency is eliminated by an opposite gravitational blueshift factor @xmath52 .",
    "however , both of these effects induce irreversible infuences on the overlap of the modes , as have been discussed respectively in refs . @xcite and @xcite.the analogous procedures can be applied to the idler beam propagation process , yielding the final operator transformations a_i()&=&_1 a_i((1 + ) ) e^-i(1+)+i^i_t ( ) + & & + e^i(1+)l / c a_i((1 + ) ) , + @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",

    "if the properties of the beams propagating through different optical paths are such that @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the dispersion effect of the atmosphere is erased .",
    "such conditions can be satisfied by allowing the  from \" idler beam to propagate at a distance less than the spatial inhomogeneities of the atmosphere from the  to \" signal beam and , equivalently , by allowing the  to \" idler beam to propagate less than the  from \" signal beam @xcite . here",
    ", the  from \" beam denotes the beam from alice to bob and vice versa .",
    "then the dispersion suffered by one of the photons can cancel that suffered by the other photon .",
    "these two photons can remain totally coincident after propagating through different optical paths .",

    "however , here we find that the disturbance on accuracy also depends on the peak frequency of the pulses , which is different from that of @xcite where the accuracy is independent of the peak frequency . in this paper",

    "we employ a typical pdc source with a wavelength of 369.5 nm ( corresponding to @xmath158thz ) and @xmath150mhz ( the relation @xmath159 is satisfied ) .",

    "the relative disturbance of the spacetime curvature on the coincidence rate is obtained as @xmath160 .",
    "the achievement of an optical lattice clock with accuracy at the @xmath161 level has been reported in refs .",

    "such a correction is comparable to the accuracy of the atom clocks and thus should be considered for the qcs between clocks in future satellite - based applications .",
