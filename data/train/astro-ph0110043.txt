    "at this meeting , it was clear that the intergalactic medium has become a key frontier across a range of disciplines within astrophysics .",
    "the equation of state of the igm is influenced by the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse cosmic uv field .",
    "it is therefore unfortunate that the far uv is the most uncertain part of the cosmic spectrum because it is very difficult to measure at any redshift ( henry 1991 ) .",
    "it is normally inferred from the ` proximity effect ' in quasar spectra , or from reprocessed recombination flux , but these bounds are highly uncertain ( kulkarni & fall 1993 ) . at low redshift ,",
    "an alternative scheme is to add up the uv escape fraction ( @xmath2 ) from likely sources , but again the estimates are highly controversial .",
    "if @xmath3 in star - forming galaxies exceeds a few percent , then massive stars probably dominate over black - hole processes in producing the ionizing background ( giallongo , fontana & madau 1997 ) .    in this invited review ,",
    "we present evidence for uv escape from galaxies (  2,3,4 ) .",
    "this conference has devoted a special session to high - velocity clouds , and so we use the second half of the paper to discuss the role of h@xmath0 distances . if the galactic halo uv field is sufficiently strong , the observed h@xmath0 flux from  clouds can provide crude distance constraints for each cloud (  5 ) .",
    "bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999@xmath4 , hereafter b99@xmath4 ) attempted to derive @xmath3 indirectly from h@xmath0 along the magellanic stream , but it now seems that uv from massive stars does not dominate at the distance of the stream . local hvcs with established distance bounds may provide a better calibration of @xmath3 , but significant uncertainties remain as we show .",
    "h@xmath0 distances may already reveal that some hvcs are dispersed throughout the galactic halo (  6 ) . in  7 , we discuss possible explanations for the stream emission and propose observational tests .",
    "this topic remains highly controversial . about the only issue not in dispute",
    "is that something is ionizing and heating the gas in the haloes of star - forming galaxies .",
    "enhanced temperatures and high levels of ionization are frequently observed in filaments and in diffuse line emission several kiloparsecs from the galactic plane ( rand 2000 ) .",
    "the radiation fields from the cosmic background , galaxy group or the hot galactic halo are much too weak ( maloney 1993 ; maloney & bland - hawthorn 1999 , hereafter mb ) .    we know",
    "that a sizeable fraction of uv photons do _ not _ escape star forming regions .",
    "bronfman et al .  ( 2000 ) , after selecting embedded massive stars from their distinctive fir colours , show that about 5.6@xmath5 ionizing photons per second are required to generate the total fir luminosity .",
    "this is about @xmath6% of the expected photon rate from the galaxy ( b99@xmath4 ; mckee & williams 1997 ) . of the remaining photons ,",
    "a large fraction is presumably absorbed within more diaphanous star - forming complexes or within the diffuse medium .",
    "the reynolds layer in the galaxy , and its counterpart in external galaxies , appears to require at least 15% of the o ( and b ) star ionizing flux , and close to 100% of the supernova kinetic energy ( reynolds 1984 ; domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; hoopes & walterbos 2000 ) . since we know that uv does manage to escape some  regions ( rubin et al .",
    "1991 ; oey & kennicutt 1997 ) , the jury has tended to side with hot , young stars while accepting that it is unclear how the uv manages to get out .",
    "an argument used against uv escaping the galaxy altogether ( m. walker , private communication ) is that the  halo gas extends vertically to 4  kpc in ngc 891 ( swaters et al .",
    "but the diffuse plasma shows high ionization out to 5 kpc ( rand 1997 ) .",
    "swaters  data is at relatively low resolution ( 15 ) and is integrated through the galaxy over a very long baseline ( @xmath720  kpc ) .",
    "the high resolution dust pictures of howk & savage ( 2000 ) reveal that the halo gas is very filamentary . for the galaxy , koo , heiles & reach ( 1992 )",
    "have found related  structures extending from the plane .    some of the best evidence that uv must escape the galaxy comes from the measured electron density profile from halo pulsars .",
    "manchester & taylor ( 2000 ; see also nordgren , cordes & terzian 1992 ) have modelled this with a scale height of 800  pc which exceeds or is comparable to the scale height of the diffuse  ( warm neutral medium ; lockman 1984 ) . without fine - tuning , it is unlikely that the reynolds layer represents a radiation - bounded medium within a co - extensive envelope .",
    "we know that the radiation field must be soft from the weakness of @xmath85876 and non - detection of @xmath84686 ( reynolds & tufte 1995 ) . furthermore , the observed weakness of [ ] @xmath86300/h@xmath0 indicates two things : ( i ) the ionization fraction must be high ( reynolds 1989 ) , ( ii ) all of the uv photons produced in the disk can not be absorbed in radiation - bounded regions ( domgrgen & mathis 1994 ) .",
    "the escape problem may be overstated in the context of the most powerful star - forming complexes which are presumably responsible for most of the uv production .",
    "we now know that the spirals with extended h@xmath9 haloes are those with high star formation rates ( rand 1996 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 )",
    ". it may be that the processes which propel gas into the halo are the same processes which help uv get out .",
    "the observed filaments along the minor axis of superwind galaxies show a clear signature of ob star photoionization and gradual dilution with altitude ( _ q.v .",
    "_ greve et al .",
    "2000 ) . on smaller scales",
    ", this may be what is happening around individual star - forming complexes which are expected to produce a complex network of superbubbles or chimneys bursting out of the stratified medium ( rosen , bregman & kelson 1996 ; mac low 1998 ; shelton 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , veilleux ( 2000 , this meeting ) presented a spectacular hst h@xmath0 image of ngc 3079 which supports this : hundreds of vertical filaments are seen emanating from star - forming complexes across the entire optical disk .",
    "from observations of four uv - bright starburst galaxies with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ , leitherer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) determined upper limits to @xmath3 of 1 , 2 , 5 and 15% , ( for mrk 496 , iras 08339 + 6517 , mrk 1267 and mrk 66 , respectively ) and concluded that the escaping fraction must be small .",
    "their analysis did not take into account the absorption of ionizing radiation by the galaxy , however , and as shown by hurwitz , jelinsky & dixon ( 1997 ) , this correction raises the above limits to 3 , 5 , 11 , and 57% , so that they no longer provide reliable constraints .",
    "( note also that hurwitz et al .  did not include the effects of absorption by molecular hydrogen , which could raise these upper limits further ; see the discussion in  4 of their paper . ) more recently , steidel , pettini & adelberger ( 2000 ) have determined that a significant fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath10 7% ) escape lyman break galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "b99@xmath4 pinned their hopes on the magellanic stream ( fig .",
    "[ bh2_fig1 ] ) , which passes over the south galactic pole , for an improved estimate of @xmath12 ( @xmath13% ) but this model underestimates the required flux by at least a factor of 5 .",
    "( their escape value @xmath12 is defined orthogonally to the disk plane ; the solid - angle averaged value is @xmath3 @xmath14 1@xmath152% . )",
    "it now seems that the stream h@xmath0 can not arise from the disk uv field ( although see  7 ) not least because weiner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that certain stream pointings are much brighter than the values modelled by b99@xmath4 ( see also putman et al.2000 ) .",
    "however , it turns out that the originally derived @xmath16 is within the required range to explain nearby hvcs (  6 ) , assuming they are photoionized by disk stars .",
    "theoretical models of the transport of ionizing radiation within an idealized galactic disk suggest that approximately 10% of the ionizing photons produced within the galaxy escape the disk entirely ( dove , shull & ferrara 2000 ; fransson & chevalier 1985 ; miller & cox 1993 ; bregman & harrington 1986 ; domgrgen & mathis 1994 ) .",
    "another theoretical approach which should be considered is a fractal gas distribution superimposed on the mckee - ostriker 3-phase model of the ism .",
    "the structure of the uv halo field is particularly important and should help to resolve several key issues .",
    "a smooth ionizing halo is more likely to provide a useful distance constraint through the surface h@xmath0 emission . in fig.[bh2_fig2]@xmath17 , we show the predicted halo field for a smooth exponential disk with uniform dust opacity and an escape fraction of @xmath18 6% normal to the disk . ( the solid - angle averaged escape fraction in this model is @xmath19% . ) if the halo field is very patchy , then the h@xmath0 distance constraint may be limited to arguing that some objects are within the sphere of influence of the galaxy ( detections ) and some are further afield ( non - detections )",
    ".    in external galaxy haloes , rand ( 1999 ; 2000 ) generally sees smooth rising trends in [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 with @xmath20 , suggesting a smooth , global ionizing source . but",
    "local variations are also seen when comparing parallel slits , and along a given slit on either side of the galaxy plane .",
    "collins & rand ( 2001 ) note that the local variations may be specific to filaments ( rather than the diffuse emission ) and seem to require an additional source of ionization .    the uv field from massive stars alone",
    "is expected to be patchy . in her phd thesis ,",
    "cianci ( 2001 ) has compared optical line maps with uv images of spirals observed by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) aboard the space shuttle . in all cases , there is a 90% match or better between uv - identified and h@xmath0 -identified  regions . in other words ,",
    "the uv images are almost indistinguishable from the h@xmath0 maps which often means that clear spiral arms are seen , particularly in late - type spirals .",
    "for the galaxy , the locations of the spiral arms  particularly the direction of the tangent points  are fairly well defined ( see fig .",
    "[ bh2_fig2]@xmath4 ; taylor & cordes 1993 ) and this has important consequences for h@xmath0 distance constraints (  6 ) .",
    "the most energetic  regions in spirals generally appear to be ` naked ' , i.e.  dust does not appear to disrupt their morphology . indeed , in his comments after the talk , r.  allen noted that this has been known a long time . in a series of papers , rozas , knapen and beckman ( e.g. beckman et al .",
    "1999 ) argue that the region h@xmath0 luminosity function appears to have a natural break at high luminosity .",
    "their preferred explanation is that uv escapes the most energetic systems .",
    "the uit images all show evidence of a diffuse inter - arm uv component .",
    "but the uit bands are set at lower energies than lyman continuum photons and therefore probably include a major contribution from af stars .",
    "in most cases , the uit images do not rule out the possibility of a more dispersed , low surface brightness disk component , either from runaway ob stars ( lynds 1980 ; hoogerwerf et al .",
    "2000 ) or field o stars ( patel & wilson 1995 ; _ q.v . _ massey et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "notably , slavin , mckee & hollenbach ( 2000 ) have recently proposed that cooling hot gas in old supernova remnants could contribute significantly to the diffuse ionizing field in the disk .",
    "this may appear to contradict our earlier statement (  2 ) that halo coronal gas provides only a weak euv field .",
    "but the coronal halo parameters ( b99@xmath4 ) produce a field that is harder than slavin s field and is therefore much less efficient in ionizing hydrogen .",
    "slavin et al.find that roughly a third of the original supernova explosion energy can re - emerge at the remnant stage as a diffuse euv field .",
    "but we note that this phase may in fact help the o star flux reach the outer halo , and may even help to smooth out the disk uv field .",
    "the h@xmath0 distance constraint ( bland - hawthorn et al .  1998 , hereafter b98 ) was originally formulated to give some indication of whether hvcs are a relatively local phenomenon or distributed on scales of tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "but it relies on our knowing the mean intensity and distribution of the halo ionizing field , which in turn relies on h@xmath0 from an  screen of known distance , covering fraction , topology and orientation to our line of sight ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999@xmath17 , hereafter b99@xmath17 ) .",
    "we originally considered the magellanic stream which goes directly over the south galactic pole and has been detected in h@xmath0 ( weiner & williams 1996 ) , but certain parts of the stream now appear to be too bright to be explained by the disk uv field (  7 ) .",
    "sciama ( 1997 , personal communication ; see also bregman 1999 ) proposed using high - velocity clouds to estimate @xmath3 , but at that time , there were few with useful distance constraints .",
    "the situation really has not improved much over the last three years . from the clouds which have been detected , we derive @xmath21% ( solid - angle averaged , @xmath22% ) by comparing these data to the predicted emission measures from a smooth exponential disk model and a spiral arm model ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 2001 , in prep . ) .",
    "there are several concerns with our application to hvcs .",
    "note that most clouds are located within 10  kpc of the sun s position . for a realistic model",
    ", we would at least expect that hvcs ` outside ' are generally fainter than hvcs ` within ' the solar circle , with or without the presence of spiral arms ( see fig .  [",
    "bh2_fig2]@xmath4 ) .",
    "the influence of the solar circle is barely evident from so few clouds .",
    "another issue is that at least two hvcs ( b98 ; putman et al .",
    "2000 ) have elevated [ ] /h@xmath0 emission . here , we are forced to assume that the [ ] emission indicates simply an enhanced electron temperature ( reynolds , haffner & tufte 1999 ) , rather than the presence of a more pernicious source ( e.g.  shock heating ) .",
    "there is a variety of ways to produce this effect , e.g. photoelectric heating ( wolfire et al .",
    "this may not be a major concern , since after all we know that high latitude gas in spirals shows enhanced low - ionization emission ( haffner , reynolds & tufte 1999 ; veilleux et al .",
    "in essence , we can use the elevated [ ] /h@xmath0 to argue that some hvcs are more than several kiloparsecs from the plane , and comprise part of the extended ionized atmosphere seen in external galaxies .",
    "wakker & van woerden ( 1997 ) have expounded on the complex history associated with high - velocity clouds .",
    "it is difficult to assign their true importance to astrophysics without a mean distance to the population .",
    "for example , a mean distance of ( 5 , 50 , 500 ) kiloparsecs leads to a total  mass of roughly ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) @xmath26 .",
    "bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 2001 ) show that the h@xmath0 emission measures of hvcs [ e@xmath27(obs ) ] are broadly consistent with the bm99@xmath4 model [ e@xmath27(model ) ] .",
    "but the model does _ not _ explain the magellanic stream detections , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "our analysis includes all hvcs with at least one known distance bound , as summarized by wakker ( 2000 ) , with the exception of 5 hvcs which are within 10  of the galactic plane .",
    "the emission measures are from the las campanas ( weiner et al .",
    "2000 ) , wham ( tufte et al .  1998 ; haffner 2000 ) and taurus surveys ( putman et al .",
    "to within a factor of a few , an escape fraction of @xmath28 6% is consistent with the observed emission measures .",
    "the predicted emission measures arise from calculating the expected flux over different cloud facets which see the disk , for a range of distances within the allowed constraints .",
    "( for clouds with upper distance bounds , we have adopted a lower bound of 0.5 kpc . )",
    "we emphasize that the predictions are at best broadly descriptive since the galaxy is modelled with a smooth exponential disk .",
    "there must be large local variations in h@xmath0 due to line - of - sight effects , limb brightening , unrelated structures at low latitude , and so on . for our crude estimate of @xmath12 to be valid , it is crucial that future h@xmath0 surveys of nearby hvcs show the influence of the solar circle (  5 ) .",
    "this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition .",
    "we would also expect to see the influence of the spiral arms along their tangent points in longitude ( _ cf .",
    "2@xmath4 ) .",
    "if the solar circle is evident in the data , but not the spiral arms , this might argue that @xmath12 is much less than 6% , and that something like the euv field of slavin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dominates the ionization .",
    "if the h@xmath0 normalization to local hvcs is valid , this may indicate that some hvcs which are faint or undetected in h@xmath0 ( weiner et al .",
    "2000 ; putman et al .",
    "2000 ) , particularly those at high latitude , are probably dispersed throughout the extended halo on scales of 50  kpc or more .",

    "* do we _ really _ know the distance and overall distribution of stream  in the absence of stellar probes along or close to the stream ? who is to say that , seen from a vantage point 3  mpc distant , the galaxy s environs do not resemble something like the complex  network in the m81/m82 group ( yun , ho & lo 1994 ) .",
    "our ` intuition ' is strongly guided by a slew of dynamical models , which show tidal tails extending from either the smc or from the lmc - smc lagrangian point ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ; li 1999 ) .",
    "in other words , we are strongly dependent on intuition guided by numerical models ( gibson et al .",
    "however , few of these models properly treat the gas or otherwise we would understand why the magellanic stream appears to have no stellar counterpart ( de vaucouleurs 1954 ; recillas - cruz 1982 ; tanaka & hamajima 1982 ; brck & hawkins 1983 ; westerlund 1990 ) , although it is possible to contrive models which separate gas and stars along tidal arms ( yoshizawa & noguchi 1999 ) .",
    "what we can say is that the lmc - smc binary interaction within the extended dark halo of the galaxy is highly complex and we are far from a detailed understanding of it .",
    "( a )    ( b )    ( c )    better distance estimates to different parts of the stream may come from halo rr lyrae or blue horizontal branch stars using the foreground - background technique to establish distance brackets .",
    "these can be easily picked out to at least 100  kpc with high quality photometry .    in fig .",

    "[ bh2_fig3]@xmath4 presents a stream that is highly dispersed in a plane where the inner edge of the stream is much closer ( say 20 kpc ) than the assumed mean distance of 55 kpc .",
    "this configuration may help to explain two observations : ( i ) the exceptionally strong h@xmath0 emission along certain sight lines (  7 ) , and ( ii ) the appearance of  lanes in fig .",

    "a nagging problem with h@xmath0 distances is the failure to explain the brightest h@xmath0 detections along the stream .",
    "for example , weiner et al .   ( 2000 ) have detected emission measures at ms  ii as high as 400  mr , compared with 2540  mr from the b99@xmath4 model at that same position .",
    "even the most contrived models may fail to patch up this discrepancy since the cloud would need to be @xmath29 times closer ( in the absence of limb brightening ) .",
    "since the stellar searches to date have been limited in scope , young massive stars may have been missed along the stream and these could explain some of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "a case in point is the shapley stellar wing in the magellanic bridge ( courtes et al .",

    "<S> significant numbers of high - velocity  clouds ( hvcs ) have now been detected in h@xmath0 , with a subset seen in low ionization lines ( e.g. [ ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> this idea requires that a useful fraction ( @xmath1% ) of ionizing photons escape the galaxy , and that the halo ionizing field is relatively smooth , as we discuss . </S>",
    "<S> hvcs which are known to be close to the sun are h@xmath0-bright ; the brightest clouds also show enhanced [ ] emission , in contrast to the magellanic stream where the low ionization emission lines are always weak compared to h@xmath0 . but </S>",
    "<S> an acute complication for h@xmath0 distances is the apparent h@xmath0 brightness of the magellanic stream along several sight lines , comparable or brighter than local hvcs . to account for this , </S>",
    "<S> we present three possible configurations for the magellanic stream and propose a follow - up experiment . </S>",
