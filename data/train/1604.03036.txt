    "one of the most important questions in cosmology is that of the initial conditions from which our present universe has began its evolution .",
    "as is well known , any answer to this question according to the standard model of cosmology based on the classical general relativity ( gr ) , suffers from the existences of an initial singularity , the so - called big - bang singularity .",
    "therefore , removing this initial singularity from the cosmological solutions of the einstein s equations is one of the most important challenges of gr and any hope to dealing with this issue would be in development of a quantum theory of gravity and consequently quantum cosmology ( qc ) . in qc a common process to remove the big - bang is to replace it with a bounce in the sense that instead of initial singular `` bang '' , the universe contracts until a minimal size ( usually of the order of the planck size @xmath0 ) , bounces from this minimal size and then re - expands in such a way its late time behavior is given by classical cosmology .",
    "however , if one accepts that such a minimal size might be a fundamental quantity , with an eye to special relativity , this question may be arise : how is it possible to have a basic minimal length in nature which all inertia observers agree on its value .",
    "one may seek the answer to this question in one of the main motivations for the formation of an effective approach to qg knows as `` doubly special relativity '' ( dsr ) @xcite .",
    "in dsr , in addition of the speed of light in standard sr , the non - linear representation of lorentz transformations in momentum space gives an other global constant as planck energy @xcite .",
    "concretely speaking , by fixing the natural cutoffs as planck length ( or energy ) dsr plays the role of a flat space - time limit of qg @xcite . as a result , in the presence of the non - linear lorentz symmetry ,",
    "standard dispersion relations may be modified up to the leading order of planck length @xcite",
    ". a natural extension of dsr is when gravity ( the curvature of space - time ) comes into the play by which we are led to `` doubly general relativity '' ( dgr ) or `` gravity s rainbow '' which is based on two principles : the correspondence principle and the deformed equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of this proposal which lead to breakdown of standard gr is that from the perspective of the particle(s ) which is ( are ) exploring the space - time , the single classical geometry does not exist .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the disruption of the system under the measurement ( here the geometry of space - time ) by means of the measuring tools ( here prob particle(s ) ) .",
    "more technically , in the framework of the gravity s rainbow , the geometry of space - time is described by a rainbow metric which itself is composed of one parameter family of the metrics which are functions of the energy of the prob particle(s ) . in the recent years , this semi - classical formalism of qg has attracted much attentions as far as various aspects of its cosmological implication has been studied , see @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to extend a previously studied work on the perfect fluid scalar - metric cosmology @xcite , and investigate the classical and quantum dynamical evolution of a flat energy - dependent frw cosmology with a perfect fluid matter source and a non - linear self - coupling scalar field minimally coupled to gravity s rainbow . to express clear , in this work we would like to derive cosmological results in the presence of a naturally cutoff as planck energy for frw space - time metric .",
    "for the matter source of gravity , we consider a perfect fluid in schutz formalism @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using this formalism is that after a canonical transformation the conjugate momentum associated to one of the variables of the fluid appears linearly in the hamiltonian and so , in a natural way , it can offer a time parameter in terms of dynamical variables of the perfect fluid .",
    "therefore , canonical quantization results in a schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt ( swd ) equation , in which this matter variable plays the role of time @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section 2",
    ", we present a brief review about the construction process of the rainbow geometry so that in the end we introduce the energy - dependent isotropic and homogeneous frw space - time metric . in section 3 , in terms of the schutz time parameter , we shall obtain the classical dynamical behavior of the rainbow cosmic scale factor and the scalar field .",
    "we deal with the quantization of the model in section 4 , and by computing the expectation values of the scale factor and the scalar field and also their bohmian ( ontological ) counterparts in section 5 , we show that the evolution of the universe according to the quantum picture is free of classical singularities .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "as mentioned above , the main idea of dgr is based on the correspondence principle and the deformed equivalence principle . therefore to construct the geometric structure corresponding to the rainbow scenario , checking these two principles",
    "is absolutely necessary . according to the correspondence principle , in the limit of low energy scales compared with @xmath1",
    ", the standard gr should be recovered .",
    "this means that @xmath2 it should be noted that the dependence of the space - time metric on the energy may be interpreted as the energy scale in which the geometry of space - time is explored by means of test particle(s ) .",
    "deformed equivalence principle , on the other hand , can be explained as : consider free falling observers in a region of space - time with a radius of curvature @xmath3 , which measure physical objects such as particles and fields with energy @xmath4 , the laws of physics are the same , provided that @xmath5 the above condition guarantees that based on dgr scenario , in the absence of the gravity ( locally ) dsr is recovered but not the standard sr . in summary , the deformed equivalence principle implies that in a region of the size @xmath0 around a given point of space - time , it is always possible to find a coordinate system in which the effects of gravity are negligible .",
    "such a coordinate system is called `` local deformed lorentz frame '' . by considering the above mentioned free falling observers as inertial observers in a rainbow flat space - time , we offer a family of local energy dependent orthonormal frame fields as @xmath6 in which @xmath7 are the standard gr counterparts of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , one gets the following flat metric for all inertial observers with various energies @xmath4 @xmath9 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two unknown energy dependent functions known as `` rainbow functions '' which according to the correspondence principle satisfy the limiting relations : @xmath12 .",
    "this means that in the low energy limit we have @xmath13 which it seems to be quite reasonable .",
    "it is important to note that due to freedom in choosing the functions @xmath14 , it is always possible to have functions with a strong damping as gaussian for example .",
    "this means that although we have introduced the interval ( [ e2 - 2 ] ) as an restriction on the energy of the probing particles , there is no reason to restrict the investigation with a cut - off at the planck scale .",
    "indeed , we may relax such a restriction and look for the rainbow particles with trans - planckian energies @xcite .",
    "particulary , a gaussian profile for the rainbow functions can have physical implications , see for instance @xcite , in which by using of a variational viewpoint based on gaussian trial functionals , it is shown that some typical divergences can be controlled .",
    "metric ( [ e2 - 4 ] ) is known as flat dsr space - time or deformed minkowski space - time and in terms of its components may be written as @xmath15 which @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the time and spatial coordinates respectively .",
    "now , let us extend this issue to the cases in which the space - time metric has a dynamical behavior .",
    "by such an extension to a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model , we may introduce the following energy - dependent ( rainbow ) frw metric @xmath18,\\ ] ] where , as usual , @xmath19 is the lapse function , @xmath20 the scale factor and @xmath21 corresponds to the open , flat and closed universe respectively . also , the the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 . + in what follows , we will study the classical and quantum evolution of a frw universe in its radiation dominate period in the context of rainbow gravity . to do this , due to the statistical nature of the very early universe ,",
    "we take an ensemble of massless particles ( like photons or gravitons ) as prob particles of the space - time . in fact",
    ", we want to consider the average effect of these particles ( which are moving on the space - time geometry ) during a given measuring process .",
    "we will see that the average energy of the prob photons may vary or may be constant with the time evolution of universe . in the following sections ,",
    "the implications of the both possibilities will be considered .",
    "let us start with a frw cosmological model whose metric is coupled with a scalar field .",
    "also , the matter role of our model is played with a perfect fluid .",
    "the action of such a structure may be written as ( we work in units where @xmath24 ) @xmath25 + 2\\int_{\\partial m}d^3x \\sqrt{h}h_{ab}k^{ab}+ \\int_m d^4 x \\sqrt{-g}p,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the ricci scalar and @xmath27 is an arbitrary function of the scalar field @xmath28 .",
    "also , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the extrinsic curvature and induced metric on the three - dimensional spatial hypersurfaces , respectively . the boundary term in ( [ e3 - 1 ] )",
    "will be canceled by the variation of @xmath31 . , where @xmath32 is the unit normal to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which is exactly equal to the variation of the second term in ( [ e3 - 1 ] ) but with different sign .",
    "] this is the reason for including a boundary term in the action of a gravitational theory .",
    "that such a boundary term is needed is due to the fact that @xmath26 , the gravitational lagrangian density contains second derivatives of the metric tensor , a nontypical feature of field theories .",
    "the third term of ( [ e3 - 1 ] ) represents the matter contribution to the total action where @xmath35 is the pressure of the fluid which together with its energy density @xmath36 obey the following equation of state @xmath37 a more familiar expression for the action of a perfect fluid is the hawking - ellis action @xmath38 , in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the fluid s density and elastic potential ( or internal energy ) respectively @xcite . by definition of the fluid s energy density and pressure as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , it is shown in @xcite that the variation of this action with respect to the metric yields the standard expression @xmath43 , for the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid",
    "however , according to what is shown in @xcite , the same result may be obtained if one varies the action @xmath44 with respect to the metric . in this respect ,",
    "the matter part of the action as is written in terms of pressure in ( [ e3 - 1 ] ) is equivalent to the usual hawking - ellis formalism for the perfect fluid .    in this work",
    "we consider the equation of state parameter @xmath45 as a constant whose values vary between @xmath46 . according to the schutz s formalism",
    "the fluid s four - velocity can be expressed in terms of some thermodynamical potentials as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 indicate the specific enthalpy and the specific entropy , respectively . also , the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 have no clear physical interpretation in this formalism .",
    "note that the fluid s four velocity should satisfy the normalization condition @xmath52 .",
    "now , considering the above action as a dynamical system in which the scale factor @xmath53 , scalar field @xmath28 and fluid s potentials are considered as independent dynamical variables , we can rewrite the gravitational part of the action ( [ e3 - 1 ] ) as    @xmath54\\right\\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which we have used the definition of the ricci scalar in terms of the metric functions and their derivatives as a constraint . in this procedure",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath55 can be obtained by variation with respect to @xmath26 , with the result @xmath56 .",
    "thus , one obtains the following point - like lagrangian for the gravitational part of the model @xmath57 now , let us return to the matter part of the action ( [ e3 - 1 ] ) from which the lagrangian density of the fluid takes the form @xmath58 by using of the first law of thermodynamics and following the standard schutz s description of the perfect fluid it can be shown that the fluid s equation of state is of the form ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath59 on the other hand if we use the expression @xmath60 as the fluid s four - velocity in the normalization condition @xmath52 , we get @xmath61 finally , using the above constraints and thermodynamical considerations for the fluid we find the lagrangian density of the matter as @xmath62 we are now in a situation to construct the hamiltonian for the model . in terms of the conjugate momenta the hamiltonian is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the momenta conjugate to each of the above variables can be obtained from the definition @xmath66 with the result @xmath67with the help of these relations and also applying the canonical transformation @xcite @xmath68 expression ( [ e3 - 14 ] ) leads to through equation ( [ e3 - 12 ] ) , its entropy seems to be free of such dependence .",
    "however , due to the bekenstein - hawking area law which is also applicable to the cosmological horizons , the entropy may also depend on the metric ( and so to the rainbow ) functions .",
    "in this situation , we may absorb all of such dependencies in variable @xmath49 .",
    "this means that in the above discussions , by @xmath49 we mean a metric dependence function . finally , by applying of the canonical transformation ( [ e3 - 17 ] )",
    ", all information will be delivered to the variable @xmath69 . ] @xmath70 ~.\\ ] ] the momentum @xmath71 , which in comparison with the other momenta in the hamiltonian function appears linearly , is the only remaining canonical variable associated with the matter .",
    "the classical equations of motion are governed in the hamiltonian formalism as @xmath72~,\\\\\\\\ \\dot{\\phi}=\\{\\phi , h\\}=\\frac{nf_2 ^ 3(\\varepsilon)}{2f(\\phi)a^3f_{1}(\\varepsilon)}p_{\\phi}~,\\\\\\\\ \\dot{p_{\\phi}}=\\{p_{\\phi},h\\}=n\\frac{f_2 ^ 3(\\varepsilon)p_{\\phi}^2}{4a^3f_1(\\varepsilon)}\\frac { f'(\\phi)}{f(\\phi)^2}~,\\\\\\\\ \\dot{t}=\\{t , h\\}=\\frac{n}{a^{3\\omega}}~\\frac{f_2^{3\\omega}(\\varepsilon)}{f_{1}(\\varepsilon)}~,\\\\\\\\ \\dot{p_t}=\\{p_t , h\\}=0~. \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also have the hamiltonian constraint @xmath73 . up to now , the cosmological setting , in view of the concerning issue of time , has been of course under - determined . before dealing with the solutions of these equations we must decide on a choice of time parameter which at the classical level may be resolved by using the gauge freedom via fixing the gauge .",
    "a glance at the above equations shows that by choosing the gauge @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 , which means that variable @xmath69 may play the role of time . now , let us rewrite the equations of motion in the gauge @xmath74 as @xmath76 here , we take @xmath77=const . by eliminating @xmath78 from the two last equations of the above system we obtain @xmath79 which can easily be integrated to yield @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an integration constant .",
    "also , if we remove the momenta from the system ( [ e3 - 19 ] ) we arrive at the differential form of the hamiltonian constraint as @xmath82 with the help of ( [ e3 - 21 ] ) this equation , for the flat case @xmath83 , can be put into the form @xmath84 before integration of this equation we have to choose the functional form of the rainbow function @xmath85 in terms of scale factor @xmath53 . however , rainbow functions are usually a function of the energy of the prob particles moving on the geometry of space - time . in @xcite , by considering the early universe as a thermodynamical system filled with prob photons at thermal equilibrium , the relation between the average energy @xmath86 of the ensemble of prob photons and energy density @xmath36 of the universe is obtained as @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is a constant ) . therefore , with the rainbow function of the form @xmath89 offered in @xcite ,",
    "we find @xmath90 finally , by replacing the the relation @xmath91 equation ( [ e3 - 23 ] ) takes the form @xmath92 here , @xmath93 is a small constant .",
    "it is seen that this equation can not be solved analytically . in figure 1 ( left ) , employing numerical methods , we have shown the approximate behavior of the scale factor @xmath20 for typical values of the parameters .",
    "we see that the evolution of the universe begins with a big - bang singularity at @xmath94 and follows an expansion phase at late time of cosmic evolution . to understand the relation between the big - bang singularity of the scale factor @xmath95 , and possible singularities of the scalar field like the blow up singularity @xmath96 ,",
    "let us find the classical trajectory in configuration space @xmath97 , where the time parameter @xmath98 is eliminated .",
    "c    from ( [ e3 - 21 ] ) , ( [ e3 - 22 ] ) one has @xmath99 in the following , we shall consider the case of a power law coupling function in the form @xmath100 . with this choice for the function @xmath27 , equation ( [ e3 - 27 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath101 again , due to the lack of an analytical solution , we have restricted ourself to a numerical solution which is plotted in figure 1 ( right ) .",
    "as is clear from this figure the scalar field blows up when @xmath95 and tends to a constant value when @xmath102 .",
    "c    now , let us consider an alternative case in which the average energy of prob photons remain constant .",
    "this assumption leads to the following solutions to the equations ( [ e3 - 23 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 27 ] ) @xmath103 and @xmath104where their behavior are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "note that for the low - energy test particles i.e. @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 and @xmath107 and so from equations ( [ e3 - 21 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 26 ] ) we recover their standard counterparts as @xmath108 and @xmath109which with the @xmath110 their solutions read as @xmath111 and @xmath112 these solutions also exhibit similar singularities as we have already discussed when we were dealing with more general cases in figures 1 and 2 . in the next sections",
    "we will see how this picture may be modified if one takes into account the quantum mechanical considerations in the problem at hand .",
    "let us now focus attention on the quantization of the model described above",
    ". the starting point will be the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation extracted from the super hamiltonian ( [ e3 - 16 ] ) . since the lapse function plays the role of a lagrange multiplier , so we have the classical constraint equation @xmath73 .",
    "in order to quantization of the minisuperspace we use the operator version of this constraint applying on the wave function @xmath113 . for a flat frw model",
    "this procedure yields @xmath114\\psi ( a,\\phi , t)=0~.\\ ] ] a look at this relation shows that the ordering @xmath115 and @xmath116 makes the hamiltonian hermitian .",
    "so , by using of the standard representation @xmath117 , we arrive at the schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt ( swd ) equation as @xmath118 we separate the variables in this equation as @xmath119 by which , equation ( [ e4 - 2 ] ) becomes @xmath120 note that here @xmath4 is a separation constant which due to the assumption of constant average energy for the prob particles can be interpreted as the scale at which the minisuperspace is searching .",
    "the solutions of the above differential equation are separable and may be written in the form @xmath121 which yields @xmath122 and @xmath123 where @xmath124 is another constant of separation .",
    "it is seen that the scalar field part of the wave function is not affected by the rainbow function . on the other hand , by choosing the rainbow function @xmath89 , the differential equation ( [ e4 - 5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath125u(a)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose general solution may be given in terms of the bessel functions as @xmath126.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] also , with @xmath127 , equation ( [ e4 - 6 ] ) has exact solution as @xmath128~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the bessel function @xmath129 has not a well - defined behavior near @xmath130 , we may set @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the eigenfunctions of the swd equation will be @xmath132 we note that if we restricted ourselves to the real values of the bessel function s argument , i.e. @xmath133 , an energy cut - off appears as @xmath134 . now",
    ", the general solution to the swd equation may be written as a superposition of its eigenfunctions , that is @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are suitable weight functions to construct the wave packets . to consider the effects of the energy s cut - off on the above wave function , we re - scale the energy as @xmath138 , so that the relation ( [ e4 - 11 ] ) takes the form @xmath139 in which @xmath140 the above integrals may be evaluated to find analytical expression if we choose the function @xmath136 to be a quasi - gaussian weight factor @xmath141 in which we also have used the approximation @xmath142 . by using the equalities @xcite @xmath143}{(2a)^{\\nu+3}}e^{-\\frac{b^2}{4a}}~,\\ ] ] the result is @xmath144~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath145~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by means of these relations in ( [ e4 - 12 ] ) , we have @xmath146 to obtain an analytical closed expression for the wave function , what remains is evaluation of the integral over @xmath124 . at this step",
    "we assume that the above superposition is taken over such values of @xmath124 for which one can use the approximation @xmath147 .",
    "now , by choosing the weight function @xmath148where @xmath149 is an arbitrary constant , and using the equality @xcite @xmath150 we are led to the following expression for the ( radiation dominated ) wave function @xmath151    c    c    in figure 3 , we have plotted the probability densities correspond to the wave function ( [ e4 - 20 ] ) for typical numerical values of the parameters . as this figure shows , at @xmath152 , the wave function has two dominant peaks in the vicinity of some non - zero values of scale factor and scalar field .",
    "this means that the wave function predicts the emergence of the universe from a quantum state corresponding to one of its dominant peaks .",
    "however , the emergence of several peaks in the wave packet may be interpreted as a representation of different quantum states that may communicate with each other through tunneling . in the other words ,",
    "there are different possible states from which our present universe could have evolved and tunneled in the past , from one universe ( state ) to another . as time grows , the wave packet begins to propagate in the @xmath53-direction , its width becoming wider and its peaks moving with a group velocity towards the greater values of scale factor while the values of scalar field remain almost constant .",
    "the wave packet disperses as time passes , the minimum width being attained at @xmath153 .",
    "as in the case of the free particle in quantum mechanics , the more localized the initial state at @xmath153 , the more rapidly the wave packet disperses .",
    "therefore , the quantum effects make themselves important only for small enough @xmath69 corresponding to small @xmath53 , as expected and the wave function predicts that the universe will undergo into the states with larger @xmath53 and an almost constant @xmath28 in its late time evolution . if we turn off the rainbow s effects in the wave function ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) , after examining the same numerical process , we verify that while the general behavior of the wave function is repeated , the rainbow model will go into its classical regime faster than the ordinary frw model .",
    "this may be a consequence of the existence of a natural cutoff as @xmath1 , in the metric .",
    "up to now , from our starting point to separate the variables in ( [ e4 - 3 ] ) , we assumed that the parameter @xmath4 is a constant interpreted as the constat average energy of the ensemble of photons . in other words , here the source of @xmath4 comes from perfect fluid composed of photons with constant average energy and thus one can interpret it as the scale at which the minisuperspace is measuring .",
    "now , we may relax this assumption and let such an energy scale can be changed .",
    "if so , we are not allowed to identity the separation constant ( the oscillatory exponential term in equation ( [ e4 - 3 ] ) ) with the energy scale by which the minisuperspace is probing . to handle this issue ,",
    "let us do a slight change in notation and show the separation constant appeared in ( [ e4 - 3 ] ) with @xmath154 which from now on should be distinguished from the energy of the probing photons .",
    "so , by putting the rainbow function into ( [ e4 - 4 ] ) , equation ( [ e4 - 5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath155 note that , only the scale factor part of @xmath156 is affected by the above assumption .",
    "the general solution of the differential equation ( [ e4 - 22 ] ) may be written as    @xmath157    where @xmath158 and @xmath159 is a degenerate hypergeometric function .",
    "for negative values of @xmath154 , @xmath160 , this expression has not a well - defined asymptotic behavior for large values of the variable @xmath53 .",
    "thus we consider @xmath161 , for which with assumption @xmath162 , we have @xmath163 by using of the following representations of the bessel function @xmath164 in terms of the degenerate hypergeometric functions @xcite @xmath165 the solution ( [ e4 - 29 ] ) reads as @xmath166 therefore , the eigenfunctions of the swd equation are given by @xmath167 as before , a superposition over the parameters @xmath154 and @xmath124 is needed to construct the wave function , that is @xmath168 to evaluate the integral over @xmath154 and get an analytic expression we do it under approximations @xmath169 and @xmath170 which result in @xmath171 and @xmath172 . by such approximations",
    "we may offer the weight function @xmath173 as @xmath174where @xmath48 is a positive constant . under this condition",
    "we are led to the final form for the wave function as @xmath175 in which we have taken again the integral over @xmath124 by approximation @xmath147 and with the weight function ( [ e4 - 19 ] ) .",
    "a qualitative investigation of the wave function ( [ e4 - 35 ] ) shows that it has the same behavior as the figure 3 , but with different ( smaller ) spreading rate .",
    "now , having the above wave functions let us see how the classical solutions may be recovered . in quantum cosmology , one usually constructs a coherent wave packet with good asymptotic behavior in the minisuperspace , peaking in the vicinity of the classical trajectory .",
    "so , to show the correlations between classical and quantum pattern , following the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , one may calculate the time dependence of the expectation value of the scale factor as @xmath176 which yields @xmath177with @xmath178 for the wave function ( [ e4 - 20 ] ) with @xmath179 , and @xmath180for the wave function ( [ e4 - 35 ] ) . in view of the existence of singularities ,",
    "these expectation values never vanish , showing that the corresponding quantum states are nonsingular .",
    "indeed , the expression ( [ e4 - 37 ] ) and ( [ e4 - 38 ] ) represent a bouncing universe with no singularity where its late time behavior is almost the same as classical solution shown in figure 1 .",
    "also , the expectation value of the scalar field reads as @xmath181 with the result @xmath182 where @xmath183 .",
    "we see that the expectation value of @xmath28 is a time independent constant which is just the behavior predicted by the wave function of the swd equation in figure 3 .",
    "in this section we are going to study the classical behavior of the dynamical variables @xmath53 and @xmath28 in the framework of bohmian quantum mechanics , according which the general form of the wave function may be written as @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath49 are some real function . substitution of this expression into the swd equation ( [ e4 - 2 ] ) leads to the continuity equation    @xmath186      recall that scale factor ( [ e5 - 9 ] ) is devoted to period of radiation dominated full of the prob photons which during the exploring the minisuperspace , their average energy remain nearly constant .",
    "finally , by combining the expressions ( [ e5 - 9 ] ) and ( [ e5 - 6 ] ) , we have drawn the behavior of @xmath201 in terms of scale factor @xmath53 for given values of numerical parameters .",
    "c    figure 4 ( left ) reflects the fact that in the context of bohmian quantum mechanics it is possible for our current universe ( with initial rainbow frw metric ) to appear from a non - zero value of scale factor .",
    "this figure shows that as the energy of prob particles ( in particular photons ) increases , the peak of @xmath201 moves towards greater scale factor . noting that in limit @xmath202 the rainbow frw metric is converted to standard frw metric , a comparison of these two cases is also plotted in figure 4 ( right ) from which we see that the peak of @xmath203 in frw background emerges in a larger scale factor in comparison with its rainbow counterpart .",
    "however , in rainbow background the probability of the emergence of the universe from a non - zero value scale factor is greater and its corresponding @xmath203 is sharper and more localized .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the classical and quantum dynamics of a scalar - rainbow metric cosmological model coupled to a perfect fluid in the context of the schutz representation . by means of the schutz formalism for perfect fluid",
    "we are able to introduce the only remaining matter degree of freedom as a time parameter in the model . due to the rainbow frw background",
    "this result has released via a particular energy - dependent gauge fixing . in terms of this time parameter , and in the framework of the hamiltonian formalism",
    ", we have obtained the corresponding classical cosmology by evaluating the dynamical behavior of the cosmic scale factor and the scalar field .",
    "we have seen that the classical evolution of the universe , with the rainbow geometry background , represents a late time expansion coming from a big - bang singularity .",
    "this is while that if the average prob energy of minisuperspace remains almost constant , there may be possibility of an early bounce ( rather than big - bang ) from a non - zero value of scale factor .",
    "this outcome is interesting from the cosmological standpoint in the sense that based on a classical picture a late time expansion does not come from an initial singularity .",
    "we then dealt with the quantization of the model in which we saw that the classical singular behavior will be modified . in the quantum model",
    ", we showed that the swd equation in the presence of rainbow frw metric can be separated and its eigenfunctions can be obtained in terms of analytical functions . in this",
    "regards , the wave functions ( [ e4 - 20 ] ) and ( [ e4 - 35 ] ) are achieved based on two different assumptions on minisuperspace prob energy .",
    "generally , both the wave functions display patterns in which there are two possible quantum states from which our current universe could have evolved and tunneled in the past from one state to another . the wave function ( [ e4 - 20 ] )",
    "has been derived with the assumption that the average prob energy of minisuperspace remains almost constant .",
    "time evolution pattern of this wave function in figure 3 demonstrated that it moves along the larger @xmath53-direction whereas the scalar field @xmath28 remains constant and does not change its shape .",
    "as time passes , our results indicated that the wave packets disperse and the minimum width being attained at @xmath153 , which means that the quantum effects are important for small enough @xmath69 , corresponding to small @xmath53 . the wave function ( [ e4 - 35 ] ) , on the other hand ,",
    "has been obtained with this idea that the minisuperspace prob energy does not stays constant .",
    "the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects , and the recovery of the classical dynamics of the universe are another important topics of our quantum presentation of the model from which the time evolution of the expectation values of scale factor and scalar field along with their bohmian counterparts have been assessed .",
    "we verified that a bouncing singularity - free universe is obtained in both cases .",
    "finally , by analyzing the probability density function @xmath203 versus scale factor @xmath53 we found that in the rainbow geometric background the probability of the emergence of the universe from a non - zero scale factor is greater than its frw metric counterpart .",
