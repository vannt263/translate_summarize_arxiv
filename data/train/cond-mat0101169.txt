    "surfaces and interfaces in liquid crystals have been the subject of much interest both from a fundamental point of view and because of their practical importance in the context of liquid crystal devices @xcite .",
    "liquid crystals are formed by anisotropic particles .",
    "depending on temperature and density , they exhibit various liquid phases . here",
    ", we shall be concerned with the isotropic phase ( i ) , which is an ordinary fully symmetric fluid phase , and the nematic phase ( n ) , where the fluid retains the translational symmetry in all directions ( no positional order ) , but exhibits long range orientational order . according to a very general symmetry argument",
    ", the transition between the isotropic and the nematic phase is first order@xcite . therefore there exist regions in phase space where nematic and isotropic fluids coexist and are separated by interfaces .",
    "the nematic state is characterized by a so - called nematic director , which specifies the preferred direction of alignment of the particles .",
    "surfaces and interfaces break the isotropy of space and usually favour a certain director orientation .",
    "this effect , called surface _ anchoring _ , is commonly characterized by the tilt angle @xmath0 between the preferred orientation and the surface ( interface ) normal , and the anchoring strength or anchoring energy . in particular ,",
    "the cases @xmath1 ( perpendicular alignment ) and @xmath2 ( parallel alignment ) are often referred to as homeotropic anchoring and planar anchoring , respectively .    theoretically , particular attention has been given to ni - interfaces in systems of hard particles .",
    "studies of ni - interfaces in hard rod systems based on onsager s approach @xcite have indicated that the surface free energy has a minimum when the rods lie parallel to the interface@xcite , suggesting that the anchoring in this system is planar .",
    "similar results have been obtained in systems of hard ellipsoids@xcite . according to the onsager theory ,",
    "the interfaces are flat , i.e. , fluctuations of the interface position ( capillary waves ) are not present .    in general",
    ", however , one would expect such fluctuations in fluid - fluid interfaces .",
    "the usual simple argument reads as follows : on very large length scales , the free energy of a system containing an interface should be governed by the interfacial tension @xmath3 .",
    "let us neglect bubbles and overhangs and parametrize the local position of a fluctuating planar interface by a single - valued function @xmath4 .",
    "fluctuations enlarge the interfacial area and thus cost the free energy@xcite @xmath5,\\ ] ] ( assuming small distortions with @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "since this free energy functional is quadratic , the partition function can be evaluated exactly .",
    "@xmath8 is easily diagonalized by means of a two dimensional fourier transform .",
    "one finds that the squared amplitude of fluctuations with wavevector @xmath9 is on average given by @xmath10 i.e. , _ diverges _ in the long - wavelength limit @xmath11 .",
    "the argument thus not only predicts on fairly general grounds the existence of capillary waves at all temperatures , but also that they are actually quite large .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that the onsager approach should be exact in the limit of infinitely elongated particles@xcite .",
    "the onsager theory assumes that the structure of the fluid is entirely determined by the second virial coefficient , _",
    "i.e. _ , by the statistical properties of clusters of two particles . in systems of",
    "very long , very thin particles , the probability that one particle interacts with more than one other particle approaches zero , and the onsager assumption becomes exact .",
    "one concludes that capillary waves should vanish in this limit , in contradiction to the argument presented just above .",
    "how can this be ?",
    "two explanations are conceivable .",
    "first , capillary waves vanish if the interfacial tension diverges . however , this is unlikely here , since the coexistence density of the nematic and the isotropic phase moves towards zero as the particle elongation is increased .",
    "second , capillary waves might be suppressed by long - range interactions , which are disregarded in the functional ( [ hcw ] ) .",
    "indeed , elastic long - range interactions are present in the nematic phase .",
    "we recall that the interface orients the director of the nematic liquid in a certain direction .",
    "long - range interface fluctuations therefore lead to long - range elastic distortions of the director field , which are penalized .    in order to shed more light on these issues ,",
    "we have carried out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of an n - i interface in a system of over 100000 particles of elongation 15 , and analyzed the capillary wave spectrum in detail .    to our knowledge , there exist only few numerical studies of n - i interfaces @xcite . in one of them @xcite , a system of molecules with length - to - width ratio @xmath12 interacting via a gay - berne potential@xcite was studied in a simulation box with a temperature inhomogeneity , which served to make and maintain the ni interface .",
    "the molecules in the nematic phase were found to align parallel to the interface ( planar anchoring ) .",
    "however , due to the use of the temperature inhomogeneity , the system is not at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "capillary waves of the interface position fluctuations are obviously suppressed . in the other studies@xcite",
    ", repulsive ellipsoids of revolution of axis ratio @xmath13 were used in a system confined between two hard walls .",
    "the interactions of the walls with molecules were systematically varied to study the interplay between surface and interface anchoring .",
    "planar alignment at the n - i interface was again observed .",
    "the system sizes considered were too small to allow for an analysis of capillary waves .",
    "the present work builds on reference @xcite .",
    "we study ni - interfaces in a very large system of repulsive ellipsoids by means of extensive computer simulations , focusing in particular on the capillary wave fluctuations of the interfaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe the model and some simulation details .",
    "section [ sec : gibbs ] explains our way to determine the local position of the interface .",
    "the results are described and summarized in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "our system consists of idealized ellipsoidal particles with elongation @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the length and width of the particles , respectively .",
    "the large value of the elongation @xmath13 ensures that the order of the transition is fairly strong , which makes it easier to generate and maintain the interface .",
    "the interaction between two ellipsoids @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the orientations of ellipsoids @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath23 is the center - center vector between the ellipsoids , of magnitude @xmath24 and direction @xmath25 .",
    "the distance function @xmath26 @xcite approximates the contact distance between two ellipsoids and is given by @xmath27 \\big\\ } ^{-1/2},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath28 is related to the elongation @xmath29 through @xmath30 since the attractive tail of the potential eqn .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) has been cut off , its range is much shorter than that of the gay - berne potential .",
    "this enables us to simulate systems with a large number of particles , which is essential to study the capillary wave effects of interest to us . for convenience",
    ", @xmath31 defines a unit of length , @xmath32 a unit of energy , and we take particle mass @xmath33 ; the particle moment of inertia is set at @xmath34 .    as a preliminary run",
    ", we performed a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a system with 7200 molecules at constant volume in a box geometry @xmath35 with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "the density was chosen in the coexistence region , @xmath36 , and the temperature @xmath37 . a nematic slab bounded by two interfaces parallel to the @xmath38 plane assembled as a result .",
    "more than @xmath39 md steps were required to equilibrate this system , where each step covers 0.002 time units .",
    "the last configuration was then reproduced @xmath40 times in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 direction , which generated a system with @xmath43 molecules and box size @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this was used as the starting point for a md simulation of @xmath46 md steps .",
    "in order to study the interfacial position fluctuations as a function of the system size , one can either perform simulations of various system sizes or simulate a single ( large ) system and analyze subsystems of it . in this study",
    ", we took the latter approach .",
    "we split our system of size @xmath47 into columns of block size @xmath48    8.5 cm    8.5 cm    and height @xmath49 .",
    "the columns are further divided into @xmath50 bins in the @xmath51 direction .",
    "the local position of the interface @xmath52@xcite in each column is estimated as follows .",
    "first , we compute the local ordering tensor @xmath53 in each bin ( of size @xmath54 ) , defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57 component of the unit vector which points along the axis of the @xmath17-th molecule ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 is the number of molecules in the bin .",
    "the nematic order parameter @xmath60 in the bin centered at @xmath51 is given by the largest eigenvalue of the ordering tensor .",
    "the further procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gibbs_method ] . once the order parameter profile @xmath60 is obtained ( solid line ) , we compute at least two averaged profiles over @xmath61 bins , where @xmath61 is chosen such that an averaged profile still reflects the existence of the interface , but short range fluctuations are averaged out ( dotted and dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : gibbs_method ] ) . finally , the position of the interface is estimated as the intersection of two averaged profiles .",
    "the method is motivated by the following consideration : if the order parameter @xmath60 did not fluctuate at all in the bulk , the intersection would locate a `` dividing surface '' , where the negative order parameter excess on the nematic side just balances the positive order parameter excess on the isotropic side .",
    "it should then be independent of @xmath61 , as long as @xmath62 is larger than the interfacial width and smaller than the total width of the nematic slab .",
    "this is not exactly true in an actual configuration due to the bulk fluctuations of @xmath60 , but the methods still works well even for small block sizes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gibbs_b10 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the total director ( the direction of the eigenvalue corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the total ordering tensor ) turned out to be so slow that the director hardly changed throughout the run .",
    "it always pointed in the @xmath42 direction .",
    "this made it convenient to resolve wave - vector components along and perpendicular to the director , without the need to apply any kind of director constraint .",
    "we used the procedure sketched in section [ sec : gibbs ] to determine the local deviations @xmath63 of the local interface position from its average for various block sizes @xmath64 .",
    "the landscape obtained for the block size @xmath65 was further analyzed and fourier transformed .",
    "fourier modes @xmath66 are labeled by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are positive integers with @xmath70 .",
    "first , we inspect the relaxation times and the correlation times of the fourier modes .",
    "the time evolution of the modes @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , is shown as a function of time ( in md steps ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evol ] .",
    "from there we estimate the number of md steps needed to equilibrate the system . for the slowest mode @xmath71 , in the direction parallel to the director",
    ", the equilibration process seems to require roughly @xmath75 md steps .",
    "based on this information , we have discarded the initial @xmath76 md steps , and collected results over the following @xmath77 md steps only .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : auto_corr ] for the slowest fourier modes in the direction normal to the director @xmath79 and parallel to the director @xmath71 .",
    "the correlation time is estimated from the slope of the fitted line as @xmath80 md steps for the @xmath72-mode and @xmath81 md steps for the @xmath82-mode .",
    "this is only by a factor of 10 smaller              where @xmath84 the lower and upper cutoffs @xmath85 and @xmath86 come into play , because the integral @xmath87 diverges as @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the actual local height distribution @xmath90 obtained from our simulations is plotted for several block sizes in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] .",
    "it can be fitted nicely by a gaussian distribution ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) .",
    "next , we study the width @xmath91 of the average order parameter profile as a function of the block size . according to the capillary wave theory ,",
    "the capillary wave fluctuations broaden it for large blocks @xmath64 according to @xmath92 here the cutoff wavevectors are given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a microscopic length which need not be specified here .",
    "the broadening effect is demonstrated for different block sizes @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] . the interfacial width can be estimated by fitting order parameter profiles such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] to _ tanh_-profiles ,      where the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the values of the order parameter in the bulk nematic and isotopic phases .",
    "( note that @xmath98 is nonzero due to the finite number of particles in a bin ) .",
    "[ fig : w2vsb ] plots the squared interfacial width @xmath99 as a function of block size @xmath64 .",
    "one clearly observes the logarithmic increase of @xmath99 with block size @xmath64 predicted by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : width ] ) . from the slope of the line one can estimate the interfacial tension , @xmath100 .    for comparison",
    ", we have also determined the interfacial tension from the anisotropy of the pressure tensor , making use of the relation @xcite @xmath101,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the normal and transverse pressure tensor components .",
    "here , we consider particles with pair interactions @xmath104 , eqn  ( [ potential ] ) and systems with two interfaces in the @xmath105-plane . neglecting finite size effects and interactions between the interfaces , eqn .",
    "( [ schofield ] ) thus reads @xmath106 the simulation data yield @xmath107 .",
    "this value agrees with earlier results obtained in smaller systems@xcite .",
    "it is of the same order , but smaller than the value estimated from the interfacial broadening .",
    "the quantitative difference possibly stems from attractive interactions between the two interfaces of the nematic slab .",
    "more simulations , in which the thickness of the slab is varied systematically , would be needed to elucidate this point .    finally , we turn to the analysis of the capillary wave spectrum @xmath108 , which is predicted to be inversely proportional to @xmath109 according to eqn  ( [ eq : hq ] ) .",
    "we study separately the @xmath9-direction parallel ( @xmath110 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath111 ) to the director . the inverse of @xmath108 in these two directions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_vs_q2 ] as a function of the squared wave vectors . in the long wavelength limit @xmath112",
    ", the spectrum appears to be isotropic , and @xmath113 approaches zero in agreement with the capillary wave theory .",
    "the initial slope is consistent with eqn .",
    "( [ eq : hq ] ) if one uses @xmath114 , and still roughly compatible if one uses @xmath115 . as @xmath9 increases , the capillary wave spectrum becomes anisotropic . as one might expect intuitively , the amplitudes @xmath108 are larger for capillary waves in the direction perpendicular to the director .",
    "deviations of capillary wave spectra from the straight line predicted by the simple capillary wave theory ( [ eq : hq ] ) are often discussed in terms of higher order terms in the capillary wave hamiltonian ( [ hcw ] ) , _ i.e. _ , terms proportional to squares of higher order derivatives of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , including the next - to - leading term leads to a prediction of the form @xmath116 , where @xmath3 is the interfacial tension and @xmath117 is a bending rigidity .",
    "one might intuitively expect that the ni - interface has bending stiffness , based on the argument that the elastic interactions should penalize interfacial bending .",
    "is thus clearly wrong . on the contrary",
    ", our unexpected result suggests that the elastic interactions influence the capillary waves on the largest length scale : the interface is rougher on short length scales than one would expect from the long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "this observation is consistent with our speculations in the introduction , that the elastic interactions may be responsible for the suppression of capillary wave fluctuations of the ni - interface in the onsager - limit of infinitely elongated particles .",
    "we note that this is not the first observation of a negative bending rigidity at a fluid - fluid interface .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been predicted theoretically for liquid - vapour interfaces @xcite and verified experimentally by c. fradin _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the negative bending rigidity is attributed in their case to long range van der waals interactions@xcite .",
    "indications of a negative bending rigidity at a liquid - liquid interface have also been found in molecular dynamics simulations of simple liquids by stecki and toxvaerd@xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied the ni - interface by large scale molecular dynamics simulation of a system of repulsive ellipsoidal molecules .",
    "we find that the standard capillary wave theory explains most of our results very well .",
    "discrepancies are encountered when looking at the amplitudes of capillary wave modes at large wave vectors , _",
