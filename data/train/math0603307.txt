    "the two bottom maps in figure  [ fig : cgen_beh_elemcob ] require some explanation .",

    "the open webs at the top and bottom of the cobordisms in the figure are to be closed only by simple curves , without vertices , and the closures of these cobordisms , outside the bits which are shown , only use cups and identity cobordisms . baring this in mind , the claim implicit in the first map is a consequence of relation  [ eq : usefuleq ] .",
