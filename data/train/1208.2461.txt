    "f / s junction , the situation is dramatically different from common f / s junctions .",
    "it has been shown that for the exchange energies higher than the chemical potential @xmath12 , a peculiar spin - resolved andreev - klein process at graphene f / s interface can result in an enhancement of the subgap andreev conductance by @xmath7 , up to the point at which the conductance at low voltages @xmath13 is larger than its value for the corresponding n / s structure@xcite . also , the corresponding andreev - klein bound states in graphene s / f / s structure are responsible for the long - range josephson coupling of f graphene@xcite . moreover , specific non - local proximity effect takes place in graphene - based superconducting heterostructures mediating purely by a non - local process known as crossed andreev reflection ( car ) which creates a spatially entangled electron - hole pair .",
    "while in ordinary non - relativistic systems the small value of car conductance is canceled by the conductance of elastic electron co - tunneling ( ct ) process , it can be enhanced in ballistic graphene n / s / n and f / s / f structures@xcite .    the above explained unusual properties of ar in graphene arise from its electronic structure which is fundamentally different from that of a metal or semiconductor . further peculiarity of graphene comes from the fact that its electrons , in addition to the regular spin , appear to come endowed with the two quantum degrees of freedom , the so called pseudospin and valley .",
    "the pseudospin represents the sublattice degree of freedom of the graphene s honeycomb structure , and the valley defines the corresponding degree of freedom in the reciprocal lattice@xcite . in this paper , we demonstrate still another peculiarity of graphene - based superconducting hybrid structures which is resulted from the pseudospin degree of freedom of electrons in graphene with a ( non - superconducting ) gap in its electronic spectrum .",
    "the effect of the pseudospin and the valley degrees of freedom has already been proven to be drastically important in several quantum transport phenomena in graphene@xcite , such that these additional quantum numbers have been proposed to be used for the controlling electronic devices in the same way as the electron spin which is used in spintronics and quantum computing@xcite .",
