    "single electron or hole spins confined in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have been suggested@xcite as prime candidates for the realization of solid - state qubits .",
    "single - shot readout of the electron spin has been demonstrated in gate controlled@xcite qds , and a very high degree coherent control of spins has been achieved in self - assembled qds.@xcite while the strong confinement of the electronic wave function in qds reduces the interaction with the substrate and , therefore , suppresses electronic decoherence mechanisms , it simultaneously enhances the hyperfine interaction between the confined electronic spin and the nuclear spin bath formed by the underlying lattice .",
    "although spin - lattice relaxation processes might contribute to the spin dephasing , it is believed@xcite that the hyperfine interaction dominates the spin relaxation in such systems .",
    "the dynamics of a single - electron spin coupled to a nuclear spin bath of non - interacting spins@xcite is described by the gaudin s central spin model@xcite ( csm ) . even though the csm is exactly solvable@xcite using a bethe ansatz ( ba ) , up to now",

    "recent spin - noise measurements performed on quantum dots@xcite charged with single electrons or holes aimed to directly reveal the intrinsic dynamics of central spins interacting with a nuclear spin bath .",
    "the spin - noise spectrum measured in @xmath7-direction shifts upon increasing the transversal magnetic field @xmath8 to higher frequencies and traces the larmor frequency @xmath9 , while the low - frequency range crosses over from a nearly lorentz shape to a @xmath10 noise.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the spin - noise spectra for the anisotropic csm@xcite using the chebyshev expansion technique ( cet ) .",
    "the cet has been developed 30 years ago@xcite and offers an accurate way to calculate the time evolution of a single initial state @xmath11 under the influence of a general time - independent hamiltonian @xmath12 operating on a finite dimensional hilbert space .",

    "spin baths differ fundamentally from bosonic baths@xcite due to their degeneracies and their finite dimensional hilbert space . over the last decade ,",

    "early on , it became clear@xcite that non - markovian corrections@xcite caused by slowly fluctuating nuclear bath configurations generate corrections to this non - decaying fraction as well as the long - time decay of spin polarization .",
    "the functional form is non - universal and depends on the details of the distribution function of the hyperfine coupling constants.@xcite a crossover from @xmath14 in the absence of an external magnetic field to a @xmath15 in a finite field has been predicted@xcite where the exponent @xmath16 is non - universal and depends on the distribution function .",
    "semiclassical approaches@xcite have been employed to access the long - time dynamics of the spin - dynamics using either a spin - coherent - state p representation@xcite or a path integral formulation,@xcite both based on coherent spin states .",
    "spin fluctuations in quantum dot ensembles have been addressed by a semi - classical langevin term in the bloch equation.@xcite    all quasi - statical and semiclassical approximations or truncation schemes in quantum - master equations allow to access the thermodynamic limit by neglecting higher order correlations in the spin bath .",
    "while such an approximation is very useful for tracing the spin - decay of an initially polarized central spin coupled to an incoherent spin bath , these approximations become questionable in coherent control experiments@xcite where a pulsed pump laser induces frequency focusing of electron spin coherence@xcite by a non - equilibrium nuclear spin polarization .",
    "numerical methods , however , accurately include the entanglement between the central spin and the spin bath but are limited to finite spin bath size .",
    "recently , the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg)@xcite has been adapted to the central spin model@xcite and has been able to push this limit to up to @xmath17 bath spins@xcite in calculation for the short time dynamics .    while most of the theoretical literature has focused on the dynamics of the central spin in a single qd , only recently a semi - classical approach@xcite has been applied to the calculation of spin - noise in an ensemble of qds charged with single electrons or holes as investigated in experiments.@xcite we have extended the cet approach to ensembles of qds and present spin - noise spectra for this case as well .",

    "therefore , it has been suggested that taking into account additional nuclear quadrupole couplings@xcite can lead to an exponential decay when these quadrupole coupling constants exceed the hyperfine coupling strength . in this paper , however , we do not consider such an additional quadrupole term .",

    "we have studied @xmath19 as a function of the external transversal magnetic field @xmath8 : while an external longitudinal field @xmath20 suppresses the spin decay of a spin initially polarized in longitudinal direction , a transverse field @xmath8 induces a larmor precession with the larmor frequency @xmath21 of the electronic spin .",

    "a finite transversal magnetic field destroys the @xmath13-peak and the center of the spectrum is shifted to larger frequencies which is given by the larmor frequency in the limit @xmath23 .    in the ising limit ,",
    "the quasi - static approximation becomes exact . in zero - field",
    ", @xmath24 can not decay at all , and at any finite magnetic field a finite non - decaying fraction of the spin polarization remains after averaging over all randomly precessing configurations in the long - time limit . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the finite frequency part of the noise spectrum shows a threshold behavior , where the threshold frequency @xmath25 is given by @xmath9 . above the threshold , we find @xmath26 for @xmath27 where the fits to our numerics are consistent with the predictions@xcite of @xmath28 .",
    "far away from the threshold , the noise spectrum contains non - universal parts and is cutoff sharply at the largest eigenenergy difference @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is determined by the details of the electronic wave function of the confined hole in the qd .    in the anisotropic csm",
