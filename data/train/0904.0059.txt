    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) underlies our current understanding of strong interaction and explains why and how the fundamental constituent , namely quarks and gluons are bound into nucleons , pions , etc .",
    "the qcd vacuum is rather complex and intriguing : while it features the overwhelming spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and color confinement , it is believed to be heated and undergo a transition at high enough temperature @xcite . as a result",
    ", quarks and gluons are no longer confined inside hadrons and a new state of strongly interacting matter , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected to form .",
    "meanwhile , the chiral symmetry gets restored .",
    "it is a goal to detect such a new state of matter for the on - going heavy - ion collision experiments at the bnl relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the near future large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "it is widely speculated that this qcd - related transition may also be of direct relevance for the evolution of the early universe @xcite    although lattice qcd has established the existence of such a thermal transition , the nature of this transition ( its order , or , whether is is a real phase transition ) has been a long time debate @xcite .",
    "it is not until recently that y. aoki and his collaborators , by exploiting quite demanding and powerful lattice simulations , assert unambiguously that qcd evolves smoothly with temperature ; that is , there is no thermodynamic phase transition for three flavors ( u , d , s - quark ) with physical current masses , but instead a smooth crossover @xcite",
    ". such a conclusion rules out some scenarios and speculations over the evolution of the early universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nature of the qcd thermal transition would lay an imprint on the universe s evolution and thus affect our understanding of the latter .",
    "for example , the previously prevailing strong first - order transition scenario predicts inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis and later formation of cold dark matter clumps @xcite .",
    "nowadays , people tend to believe that the nature of qcd thermal transition depends on the quark content and current quark masses @xcite . in the chiral limit , the chiral phase transition is likely to be of second order for two flavors and first order for three flavors . for infinite or very large current quark masses ,",
    "the transition turns out to be a first - order deconfinement transition . for intermediate current masses ,",
    "one may end up with a crossover , instead of a real phase transition , meaning that thermodynamic quantities would show a rapid change , as opposed to a jump , in a narrow temperature range .    as is well known",
    ", first principle lattice simulations provide the prior choice to address the thermal qcd transition problem , because of its intrinsic nonperturbative nature . in this regard , recently y. aoki and collaborators @xcite achieved a large scale computing and identified the nature of three - flavor qcd finite temperature transition as a smooth crossover at physical quark masses . on the other hand , other than lattice simulations , continuum nonperturbative model study can be a complementary approach to thermal qcd transition . following",
    "y. aoki et al . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we present a continuum model study of the interesting chiral susceptibility in the present work , from whose behavior as temperature varies we identify the nature of two - flavor qcd thermal transition in the case of physical current quark masses as well as in the chiral limit .    we first derive a model - independent analytical formula , which expresses chiral susceptibility as a integral in terms of dressed propagators and dressed scalar vertex . the quadratic divergence inherent in this susceptibility",
    "is then demonstrated and an appropriate renormalization procedure is specified . in the section that follows , this result is then illustrated by a model calculation based on an effective interaction in the framework of rainbow dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) and ladder bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) approach .",
    "the notorious quadratic ultraviolet divergence is appropriately subtracted by a delicate numerical procedure .",
    "the results obtained are carefully analyzed and a crossover and a second - order phase transition are respectively identified for the cases of physical and zero current quark masses . the final section is devoted to the conclusion and discussion . throughout this paper",
    ", we work with euclidean space metric : @xmath0 .",
    "chiral susceptibility has interested quite a few lattice qcd practitioners and attracted much investigation @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the qcd partition function at finite temperature and vanishing chemical potential .",
    "@xmath3\\}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are subject to anti - periodic and periodic conditions , respectively ; and we leave the gauge fixing term and the ghost field term to be understood . note that chiral susceptibility is defined for two light flavors and hence @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is supposed to be the degenerate current mass of u , d quarks .",
    "the second line of that equation also indicates that the chiral susceptibility measures the response of chiral condensate ( the order parameter ) to a small perturbation of the parameter responsible for explicit breaking of chiral symmetry ( the current quark mass ) .    formally , using quark propagator we can always write the quark condensate as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes trace over dirac indices of the quark propagator , @xmath10 is the color factor and @xmath11 denotes two degenerate light flavors . substituting eq .",
    "( 3 ) into eq . ( 1 ) and adopting the identity @xmath12 we have @xmath13.\\ ] ] we consider the mass @xmath7 as a constant background scalar field coupled to the quark fields by the term @xmath14 . then @xmath15 is the dressed quark propagator in the presence of such a background field and the derivative of its inverse with respect to the current quark mass yields the so - called one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) dressed scalar vertex ( a three - point correlation function ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the relative momentum .",
    "this relation may be called `` scalar ward identity '' .",
    "note that the total momentum of the dressed scalar vertex vanishes because the background scalar field @xmath7 is a constant that takes no momentum .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( 6 ) into eq .",
    "( 5 ) gives @xmath18.\\ ] ] this is the integral formula for chiral susceptibility at zero temperature .",
    "diagrammatically , the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 7 ) expresses the feynman diagram for the color - singlet scalar vacuum polarization at zero total momentum .",
    "this clearly shows that chiral susceptibility at zero temperature equals the color - singlet scalar vacuum polarization at zero total momentum .",
    "according to finite - temperature field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the corresponding finite temperature version is obtained by replacing the integration over the fourth component of momentum with summation over fermion matsubara frequencies : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 with matsubara frequencies @xmath21 . here",
    "it should be noted that in the chiral limit the above expression for the chiral susceptibility reduces to the corresponding expression ( eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so we have derived a model - independent integral formula which expresses the chiral susceptibility in terms of the dressed quark propagator and the dressed scalar vertex , both of the latter being basic quantities in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "the dse - bse approach provides a desirable framework to calculate these quantities non - perturbatively and hence the chiral susceptibility .",
    "there resides an additive quadratic ultraviolet divergence in the chiral susceptibility , which can manifest itself even in the chiral limit @xcite . to see this unambiguously",
    ", we calculate the chiral susceptibility in the case of free quark gas , because all quantities tend to the free case counterparts in the ultraviolet limit ( asymptotic freedom ) and all divergences originate from the ultraviolet limit . in this case , the dressed scalar vertex reduces to the bare one , i.e. @xmath22 and the free quark propagator in the chiral limit reads @xmath23 substituting eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) into eq .",
    "( 8) , one gets @xmath24 with the aid of the identity @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi - dirac statistics function , we have @xmath27 the second part of the integrand can be integrated out and gives a purely temperature - dependent finite result : @xmath28 .",
    "on the contrary , the first part yields an additive quadratic divergence .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the free quark - number susceptibility , which is a definitely finite quantity proportional to @xmath29 and therefore vanishes at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "actually , there always contains an inherent additive quadratic divergence in chiral susceptibility .",
    "one dose not really have to address the issue of the regularization of this quadratic divergence , when one works with a hard cut - off in the numerical integration ( e.g. , lattice simulations ) , and is concerned only with the temperature - dependent behavior of the susceptibility , not so much on its absolute value @xcite .",
    "however , a correct renormalization procedure is important and indispensable if one wants to get correct physics in the continuum limit @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we identified the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility and argued that it is of major relevance and free from quadratic ultraviolet divergence .",
    "however , we were unable to derive the disconnected chiral susceptibility directly from a first - principle approach such as the functional integral method . looked at from this point , the identification of the disconnected chiral susceptibility is not yet absolutely `` waterproof '' and solid enough .",
    "so in this paper we follow the renormalization procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is to subtract the zero temperature susceptibility and study the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "that is to say , we define the renormalized chiral susceptibility by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are provided by eq .",
    "( 8) and eq .",
    "( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "the justification for this renormalization is two - fold : firstly , the quadratic divergence is additive and temperature - independent and hence can be really removed by subtracting the zero - temperature susceptibility ; secondly , this subtraction will never affect the genuine temperature effects of chiral susceptibility that we are interested in .",
    "having specified the renormalization procedure , in the next section , we will focus on the model numerical calculation of the renormalized chiral susceptibility @xmath35 within the framework of dse - bse .",
    "dyson - schwinger equations provide a non - perturbative , continuum approach for the exploration of strong interaction physics @xcite .",
    "derived from qcd s euclidean space generating functional , they constitute a tower of enumerable coupled integral equations whose solutions are the n - point green s functions .",
    "a consistent truncation scheme that makes the dse calculations tractable is the so - called rainbow - ladder approximation .",
    "such a rainbow - dse and ladder - bse approach has been used extensively in the investigation of spontaneously chiral symmetry breaking and confinement @xcite and also found successful applications in calculating light pseudo - scalar and vector meson observables @xcite as well as in describing strong interaction at finite temperature and/or density @xcite .",
    "the subsequent model calculation of chiral susceptibility will also be conducted systematically and consistently in the rainbow - dse and ladder - bse framework with an effective gluon propagator .",
    "we first calculate the zero - temperature chiral susceptibility with eq .",
    "this involves the calculation of dressed quark propagator and dressed scalar vertex .",
    "the former is solved from the rainbow gap equation @xmath36 and the latter satisfies the ladder inhomogeneous bse ( the total momentum of the dressed scalar vertex has been set equal to zero ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the effective gluon propagator , which is usually a phenomenological input in practice ( it should also be noted that the analytical structure of the gluon propagator has been explored from numerical solutions of coupled dses of quarks , gluons and ghosts and from fits to lattice data in recent literatures , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    at the moment , we pause for a while and give a brief proof that the rainbow - ladder truncation scheme of dse - bse respects the scalar ward identity ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) . taking the derivative with respect to @xmath7 on both sides of eq .",
    "( 15 ) and using again the identity eq .",
    "( 4 ) , one arrives at @xmath39 comparing eq .",
    "( 16 ) and eq .",
    "( 17 ) , one sees that @xmath40 and @xmath41 satisfy the same integral equation and therefore they must be equal , i.e. , the scalar ward identity holds at the level of the rainbow - ladder truncation .",
    "that is to say , the rainbow - ladder dse - bse model calculation respects the scalar ward identity , whatever form the effective model gluon propagator takes .",
    "in fact , the rainbow - ladder truncation scheme of dse - bse itself is consistent in a broader sense .",
    "in addition to the scalar ward identity , this truncation scheme preserves the abelian vector ward - takahashi identity and the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "it is the preservation of the latter identity that guarantees an understanding of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking in the rainbow - ladder dse - bse framework without a fine - tuning of model - dependent parameters @xcite .    in this paper",

    "there is no singular behavior any more : the peak of the susceptibility becomes not so sharp and pronounced as in the chiral limit ; its height is greatly suppressed and evidently finite ; and there is no unique temperature , but instead a range of finite width where the transition phenomenon takes place . also notable are the decrease in the height of the susceptibility peak and that the susceptibility peak has a minor shift from @xmath101 to @xmath102 as the current quark mass increases .",

    "after appropriately regularizing the additive quadratic divergence , we perform a model calculation of the renormalized chiral susceptibility within the dse - bse framework with a confining separable model gluon propagator which facilitates summation over matsubara frequencies .",
    "our model study shows that in the chiral limit , the renormalized chiral susceptibility exhibits a narrow , divergent peak at chiral critical temperature @xmath99 , signaling a second - order phase transition driven by chiral symmetry restoration . on the other hand , at physical current quark masses , the renormalized chiral susceptibility features a crossover , which involves a rapid , but by no means singular , change in a temperature range of non - vanishing width .",
    "so , encouragingly , the lattice qcd observations @xcite are reproduced .",
    "compared to other continuum model studies , like dse model study @xcite and njl - type model study @xcite , the present work calculate the chiral susceptibility from an alternative definition ( the former two model studies defined the susceptibility as the derivative of the generated mass with respect to the current quark mass and hence the quadratic divergence was circumvented ) and in particular from a model - independent expression for the susceptibility . within the present framework for the chiral susceptibility , the role of the dressed scalar vertex is consistently included into account .",
    "however , the present rainbow - ladder dse - bse model study still belongs to the class of mean - field approximations , like the two model studies mentioned above .",
