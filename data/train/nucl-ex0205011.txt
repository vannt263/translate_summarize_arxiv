    "the electron - antineutrinos observed by the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite laboratories from supernova 1987-a confirmed that neutrinos play an important role in core collapse supernovae .",
    "the vast majority of the gravitational binding energy of the protoneutron star is radiated away by neutrinos .",
    "the observed @xmath2 were detected over a few seconds , much longer than the weak interaction time - scales which are thought to be required to produce them .",
    "this confirmed the main features of the standard model of core - collapse supernovae  @xcite and suggests that the behavior of the neutrino opacity in matter beyond nuclear densities is understood @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in numerous supernova simulations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , the shock that will produce the supernova stalls , thus disfavoring a prompt mechanism @xcite .",
    "although there are many uncertainties in the calculations , indications that the shock has to be revived by neutrinos are strong @xcite .    an increasing body of data from the atmospheric neutrino experiments at super - kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , soudan2 @xcite and kamiokande @xcite , exhibit the disappearance of @xmath3-neutrinos @xcite .",
    "solar neutrino experiments such as homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite also suggest a flux of @xmath4 s inconsistent with the bahcall - pinsonneault standard solar model .",
    "the most favored solution to these discrepancies is an extension of the standard model of particle physics to one in which the neutrinos have mass and are allowed to oscillate between flavors via the vacuum and/or the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw- ) oscillation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "direct measurements of the neutrino masses @xcite yield upper limits of @xmath5 ( 90@xmath6cl ) , @xmath7 ( 90@xmath6cl ) and @xmath8 ( 95@xmath6cl ) .",
    "however , the tremendous neutrino luminosities of supernovae provide a unique scenario for extremely long baseline measurements , allowing a vastly increased region of neutrino mixing parameter space to be probed , and placing more stringent limits than can otherwise be achieved on neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "the astrophysical r - process may also depend critically on the properties of neutrinos .",
    "the leading candidate for its site is the low - density , high - entropy bubble of a core - collapse supernova , created in the trail of the outgoing shockwave by material lifted off the surface of the protoneutron star and heated by neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the details of the interaction between the neutrinos and matter in the bubble are highly nonlinear , and may require several types of msw - type oscillations @xcite .",
    "an observation of the fluxes of different neutrino flavors is vital for the understanding of core - collapse supernovae and helpful for the investigation of new physics beyond the standard model . in this context , the need for a large neutral - current neutrino detector has become increasingly obvious in recent years @xcite . accordingly , omnis is being designed to provide a much larger sample of @xmath3- and @xmath9-neutrino events than would be provided by other detectors , allowing a significantly more detailed measurement of the neutrino spectra for different flavors , resolved in time , and the stellar conditions that produced them . given the planned quantities of iron and lead , and with the detection strategy suggested here , a typical supernova at the center of the galaxy would lead to about 2000 observed events in omnis @xcite ( assuming no oscillations ) , predominantly from _ neutral - current _ reactions .",
    "these events will provide a window for looking well beyond the peak of the supernova neutrino burst to study the evolution at times up to @xmath10 after the start of the pulse , a potentially important diagnostic of the cooling mechanism .",
    "a few thousand events are also adequate for accurate neutrino mass measurements .",
    "most present neutrino detectors , such as super - kamiokande , lvd , macro and amanda , are primarily sensitive to charged - current channels , involving mainly the reaction of @xmath2 with protons in water or mineral oil .",
    "super - kamiokande will also see some @xmath11-neutrinos and some @xmath3- and @xmath9-neutrinos through the detection of @xmath12-rays produced in the neutral - current channels @xmath13 , as suggested by langanke and vogel @xcite .",
    "the total number of detected neutral - current events due to @xmath3- and @xmath9-neutrinos for a core - collapse supernova at a distance of @xmath14 has been estimated to be around 300 or 560 , depending upon the temperature and chemical potential in the neutrino fermi - dirac distribution assumed .",
    "recent changes to the data acquisition that result in a lower detection threshold might improve this to around 1000 events  @xcite .",
    "however , this yield comes from a single reaction threshold and so the unknown neutrino energy distribution can not be inferred .",
    "sno , which is designed around a tank of heavy water , would be expected to produce around 750 break - up events of deuterium following neutrino neutral - current scattering for a supernova at the same distance @xcite .",
    "it is on the other hand scheduled for a lifetime at the low edge of the mean time between galactic supernovae ( 10 - 30 years , @xcite ) , even though sno s scheduled time has been extended from two to ten years .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , based on time - of - flight information , super - kamiokande and sno will have resolutions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , although again the improved statistics due to a lower detection threshold will improve considerably the value for super - kamiokande . due to both",
    "the greater number of neutral - current events detected , and to its superior timing capability , omnis is expected to have a still better mass resolution of around  @xmath17 .",
    "a particularly interesting scenario is that in which a galactic core - collapse supernova proceeds to a black hole .",
    "this should produce an abrupt termination of neutrino flux as well as several remarkable measurements .",
    "firstly , the signal preceding the cut - off , and when the signal occurs may depend on the protoneutron star evolution , and hence the equation of state  @xcite .",
    "secondly , as the black hole expands outward from the center of the star it will envelope successive neutrinospheres  @xcite . one might therefore expect the @xmath18-flux to be terminated earlier than the @xmath2-flux which would in turn occur before the termination of the @xmath4-flux . the difference in time between these terminations has been estimated to be of order @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "if the supernova is close enough , omnis would be able to observe these differences , and thus could infer the structure of the neutrinospheres .",
    "lastly , the termination of the luminosity provides a well defined feature that would provide an opportunity for time - of - flight mass measurements of the neutrino mass with unparalleled accuracy , down to limits of @xmath20 for @xmath2 in super - kamiokande and as low as @xmath21 for @xmath3- and @xmath9-neutrinos from omnis @xcite .      in order to make estimates of the response of the omnis detectors to a supernova ,",
    "we have included standard expectations for the incident neutrino intensities , energy distributions and interaction cross sections .",
    "the bulk of the neutrino luminosity from a core - collapse supernova is emitted during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase , which is marked by an exponentially decaying neutrino flux with a time constant of @xmath223  @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "each flavor is described by a fermi - dirac distribution with a chemical potential at or near zero . at the relevant energies ,",
    "the @xmath3- and @xmath9-neutrinos only interact via neutral - current processes , and therefore decouple deeper within the core ( at a smaller neutrinosphere radius , the term being defined as the radius from the center at which neutrinos decouple from the dense matter ) , leaving them with the highest energies , estimated to be around @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "electron - neutrinos decouple at a larger neutrinosphere radius , with the net numerical superiority of neutrons to protons resulting in the @xmath11-antineutrinos having higher energy than the @xmath11-neutrinos ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 versus @xmath28 or @xmath29 @xcite ) .",
    "omnis will consist of several @xmath30 modules of lead and iron , which will serve as target materials .",
    "some of the incoming neutrinos from a supernova will undergo charged - current or neutral - current interactions with the composite nuclei , resulting in neutron emission .",
    "the cross sections for such reactions depend on the neutrino energy , the q - value for the reaction and the availability of suitable energy levels in the target nucleus .",
    "there are no available experimental data for the cross sections governing these reactions , with the exception of that for @xmath31 measured by the karmen collaboration @xcite , but theoretical studies have been conducted by two groups @xcite .",
    "despite qualitative agreement between the two groups , some uncertainty remains , due to the largely unknown location of the gamow - teller resonance relative to the neutron separation energies .",
    "these separation energies are @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 for single - neutron emission and @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , for double - neutron emission .",
    "the single - neutron channels in lead and in iron and the two - neutron channel in lead constitute three observables closely related to the neutral - current thresholds that can be used to deduce the relevant contributions of the various neutrino flavors via the different energy dependencies of their cross sections",
    ". both sno and super - kamiokande will provide additional reaction thresholds and their data could be used in collaboration with those from omnis to map out the neutrino distributions .",
    "all event numbers presented in this work are based on a `` standard '' supernova in the center of the galaxy ( distance = @xmath14 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the number of neutrons liberated per @xmath39 in omnis modules of lead or iron is indicated in table [ prodratetable ] .",
    "the cross sections for lead were taken from @xcite and for iron from @xcite .",
    ".comparison for single- and double - neutron events liberated from iron and lead for the different reaction channels ( per @xmath39 ) [ prodratetable ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "once built , omnis will fill in the long perceived need for a large neutral - current supernova neutrino detector .",
    "the neutrino fluxes for the different flavors will be measured using the yields from multiple threshold processes , single- and double - neutron emission in lead and single - neutron emission in iron .",
    "the time resolution is only limited by the event rate ( and therefore the distance ) of the supernova .",
    "this will reveal unprecedented insight into the core - collapse supernova mechanism and might , for the first time ever , open up a window onto the black hole formation mechanism , and possibly enable the observation of the different neutrinosphere radii for different neutrino flavors .",
    "in addition , omnis is capable of placing new limits on the allowed neutrino mass - mixing angle phase space using time - of - flight methods for different flavors and the relative yields for the different neutron liberation channels .",
    "the generic designs for the omnis modules are walls of lead or iron , interlaced with stacks of vessels containing organic liquid scintillator loaded with gd .",
    "a double - pulse trigger with the capture @xmath12-ray pulse giving the confirmation to the preceding neutron pulse in the same scintillator vessel was identified as an effective means to discriminate neutron events against the radioactive background . using the monte carlo code damocles , developed for omnis , optimum configurations for the detector geometry of the iron and the lead modules",
    "were found with respect to the maximum number of events for a given unit cost .",
    "the resulting detection efficiencies for @xmath30 modules are @xmath40 for single- and @xmath41 for double - neutrons in lead and @xmath42 for iron . however , the detection efficiency might improve due to lower possible thresholds when off - line analysis of the data is performed .",
    "given the predicted numbers of neutrons liberated , we estimate a total of @xmath43 of lead and @xmath44 of iron is needed for the omnis detector .",
    "the false trigger rate caused by the radioactive background in the presence or absence of a supernova neutrino pulse was investigated with the result that tolerance levels lie within the range found in commercially available materials .",
    "the criterion was a false rate of @xmath45 , low enough to still detect a sparse neutron signal .",
    "the overall neutron trigger rate is below @xmath46 for a @xmath30 module and a `` standard '' galactic supernova @xcite , which would enable the use of a common trigger gate for the entire detector .",
    "if , however , a supernova occurs at distances less than @xmath47 , the typical time between two - neutron events at the peak of the signal becomes lower than typical dead times of @xmath48 , in which case common trigger gates for smaller numbers of or even individual photomultiplier tubes become desirable in order to measure the peak neutron liberation rate , at least for part of omnis .",
    "this work is supported by the national science foundation , grant number phy-9901241 and by the ohio state university .",
    "we would especially like to thank the carlsbad area office of the department of energy and the waste isolation division of the westinghouse corporation which operate the waste isolation pilot plant for their support .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were supported in part by a grant from the ohio supercomputing center ."
