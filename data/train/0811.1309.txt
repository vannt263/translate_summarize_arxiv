    "studies on the decoherence dynamics of open quantum systems are of great importance to the field of quantum information science @xcite . any realistic analysis of quantum information protocols should take into account the decoherence effect of the environment . in many quantum communication and computation schemes , information is transmitted using photons . for instance , the first experimental verification of quantum teleportation @xcite used pairs of polarization entangled photons to transfer the polarization state of one photon onto another @xcite . within a year , unconditional quantum teleportation of optical fields was demonstrated experimentally using squeezed - state entanglement @xcite .",
    "given their central role in these schemes and many others , much work has been carried out on the decoherence dynamics of optical fields . in particular ,",
    "several authors have studied the continuous variable entanglement of optical fields ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "conventional approaches not only treat the interactions between the quantum system @xmath0 of interest and its environment @xmath1 perturbatively , they also assume that the environmental correlation time @xmath2 is small compared to the time scale @xmath3 for significant change in @xmath0",
    ". these yield approximate equations of motion , i.e. master equations , under the born - markov approximation @xcite . indeed , many studies on the entanglement dynamics of continuous variable system relied on this approximation @xcite .",
    "however , it is evident from recent experiments ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that there are many physically relevant situations where the markovian assumption does not hold , and a non - markovian treatment of the open system dynamics is necessary .",
    "so , there has been an increasing interest in the understanding of the decoherence effect of open quantum system going beyond the born - markovian approximation in the last decades @xcite .",
    "very recently , some phenomenological models on non - markovian entanglement dynamics of optical fields have been investigated @xcite .",
    "it was found that in contrast to the monotonic decrease of entanglement over time in born - markovian entanglement dynamics @xcite , there are transient entanglement oscillations in non - markovian ones .",
    "these oscillations are caused by the backactions of the environments on their respective local quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the backaction , characteristic of non - markovian dynamics , means that the environments with their states changed due to interactions with the systems , in turn , exert their dynamical influences back on the systems .    in this paper",
    "we consider the exact decoherence dynamics of the continuous variable entangled squeezed state of two single - mode optical fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , that are spatially separated .",
    "each optical field , @xmath6 , interacts with its own environment @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent and uncorrelated .",
    "we study the exact entanglement dynamics of the two optical - field system for different @xmath2 s in comparsion with @xmath3 , and analyze when the system dynamics will exhibit novel non - markovian effects , and provide a detailed description of these . to this end",
    ", we use the influence functional formalism @xcite , developed explicitly in refs .",
    "our results show that besides the short - time oscillations , the non - markovian effect can affect the long - time behavior of the system dynamics and the steady state as well . in particular , when @xmath2 is comparable to @xmath3 , we find that the backaction effects counteract the dissipative effects of @xmath11 on @xmath12 respectively .",
    "this leads to there being some nonzero residual entanglement in the steady state .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a model of two single - mode optical fields in two independent and uncorrelated environments ; and outline the exact dynamics that was derived in detail in ref . @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , using logarithmic negativity as an entanglement measure of continuous - variable states , we discuss the entanglement dynamics of the entangled squeezed state .",
    "iv presents the numerical results of the entanglement dynamics , where we analyze explicitly the non - markovian effect of the environments on the system for different @xmath2 s in comparison with @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system @xmath12 plus environment @xmath11 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are , respectively , the hamiltonian of the two optical fields , the two independent environments , and the interactions between them . the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath8 ) are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath17-th optical mode with frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the two independent environments are modeled , as usual , by two sets of harmonic oscillators described by the annihilation and creation operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the coupling constants between the @xmath17-th optical field and its environment are given by @xmath21 .",
    "currently , most quantum optical experiments are performed at low temperatures and under vacuum condition . in this case ,",
    "vacuum fluctuations are the main source of decoherence .",
    "therefore , we take the environments to be at zero temperature throughout this paper .    since we are only interested in the dynamics of @xmath12 , we like to eliminate the degrees of freedom of @xmath11 .",
    "the influence - functional theory of feynman and vernon @xcite enables us to do that exactly . by expressing the forward and backward evolution operators of the density matrix of the system @xmath12 plus environment @xmath11 as a double path integral in the coherent - state representation @xcite , and performing the integration over the degrees of freedom of @xmath11",
    ", we incorporate all the environmental effects on @xmath12 in a functional integral named influence functional @xcite .",

    "we emphasize that the derivation of the master equation goes beyond the born - markovian approximation and contains all the backactions between the system and the environments self - consistently .",
    "all the non - markovian character resides in the time - dependent coefficients of the exact master equation .",
    "the time - dependent coefficients in the exact master equation , determined by eq .",

    "different spectral densities manifest different non - markovian decoherence dynamics .",
    "we note that our exact master equation reduces to the conventional master equation under the relevant markov approximation .",

    "this measure is based on the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite that a bipartite quantum state is separable if and only if its partially transposed state is still positive .",
    "for the continuous - variable ( gaussian - type ) bipartite state , its density matrix is characterized by the covariance matrix defined as the second moments of the quadrature vector @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the canonical commutation relations take the form as @xmath68 = iu_{ij}$ ] , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 defining the symplectic structure of the system .",
    "the property of the covariance matrix @xmath71 is fully determined by its symplectic spectrum @xmath72 , with @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) the eigenvalues of the matrix : @xmath75 .",
    "the uncertainty principle exerts a constraint on @xmath76 such that @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thus the peres - horodecki criterion for the continuous - variable state can be rephrased as the state being separable if and only if the uncertainty principle , @xmath78 , is still obeyed by the covariance matrix under the partial transposition with respect to the degrees of freedom of a specific subsystem @xcite . in terms of phase space ,",
    "the action of partial transposition amounts to a mirror reflection with respect to one of the canonical variables of the related subsystem .",
    "for instance , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the partial transposition with respect to the second subsystem .",
    "if a gaussian - type bipartite state is nonseparable , the covariance matrix @xmath81 will violate the uncertainty principle and its symplectic spectrum @xmath82 will fail to satisfy the constraint @xmath83 .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is then used to quantify this violation as @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the smaller one of the two symplectic eigenvalues @xmath86 .",

    "in the following , we analyze explicitly the exact decoherence dynamics of the entangled squeezed state of @xmath12 under the influence of @xmath11 . for simplicity , we assume from here on that the two optical fields are identical , i.e. , @xmath94 ; and they interact with the same strength , @xmath95 , with their individual environments . for definiteness , we consider both @xmath9 and @xmath10 to have ohmic spectral density .",
    "the environmental correlation time @xmath2 in this case is roughly inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) , i.e. , @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that the cutoff frequency @xmath98 , which is originally introduced to eliminate infinities in frequency integrations , therefore also determines if the dynamics of open system @xmath0 is markovian or non - markovian .",

    "[ f1 ] , we plot the numerical results of the decay rate @xmath99 and logarithmic negativity @xmath92 when @xmath100 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath99 throughout the whole evolution process guarantees the monotonic decrease of @xmath92 .",
    "accordingly , the entangled squeezed state eventually evolves to a product state , namely the ground state of the system : @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , in this case , the backactions of @xmath11 have a negligible effect on the dynamics of @xmath12 , and we say the system dynamics is mainly governed by the dissipative effect of the environments .",
    "there is thus no qualitative difference between the exact entanglement dynamics and the markovian results .",
    "quantitatively , however , we note that for @xmath102 , the distinctive increase of @xmath99 results in @xmath92 decreasing rapidly .",
    "this non - markovian effect only shows up in a very short time scale .",
    "in fact , for @xmath103 , @xmath99 decreases and approaches gradually to a constant value as @xmath104 approaches @xmath3 ; and the rate of decrease of @xmath92 decreases .",

    "firstly , we note that @xmath99 can take negative values . physically , this corresponds to the systems reabsorbing photons from the environments , which leads to an increase in the photon number of the systems @xcite .",
    "these negative decay rates provide evidences for backactions in non - markovian dynamics @xcite .",
    "secondly , we observe that @xmath99 approaches zero asymptotically .",
    "both results clearly differ from the markovian ones .",
    "consequently , @xmath92 presnts distinctive behaviors that are absent in the markovian results .",
    "firstly , due to the negative decay rates , @xmath92 shows oscillations . we must emphasize that these oscillations are fundamentally different from the transient entanglement oscillations previously obtained when two optical - fields interact with a common environment @xcite .",
    "they are caused by the backactions of the environments on their respective local optical fields and are characteristic of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "similar oscillations have been obtained in a system of two two - level atoms in two separated damping cavities @xcite . secondly , and more interestingly",
    ", we find that there is some residual entanglement left in the steady state . from previous studies @xcite ,",
    "one would have concluded that non - markovian effects only show up in short - time dynamics .",
    "our results , however , clearly show on the contrary that non - markovian effects can also have an influence on the long - time behavior of the system dynamics and the final steady state of the system .",
    "this counterintuitive behavior can be explained with the fact that the dissipative influence on the entanglement dynamics by the environments is strongly counteracted by the effect due to their backactions .",
    "consequently , the decay of the entanglement ceases when the system evolves to some steady state , which is not the ground state @xmath106 .",
    "the results when @xmath107 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ; a situation considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to extremely long memory of the environments ,",
    "the backactions on the systems are so strong that they govern the decoherence dynamics . as a result , @xmath99 and",
    "hence @xmath92 oscillate over a very long duration .",
    "these oscillations persist even as the state approaches the ground state .",
    "the ` equilibrium ' position for the oscillation of @xmath99 is not at zero , but a small positive value .",
    "this positivity means the systems dynamics will experience a weak dissipation , which is verified by the time evolution of @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the exact entanglement dynamics of the two optical - field system for different @xmath2 s in comparison with @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , we have analyzed when the system dynamics will exhibit novel non - markovian effects , and provided a detailed description of these .",
    "we have applied the influence - functional method of feynman and vernon to investigate the exact entanglement dynamics of two single - mode optical fields @xmath12 coupled to two independent and uncorrelated environments @xmath11 . from our analytical and numerical results",
    ", it is seen that @xmath11 exert two competing influences on our system .",
    "one effect , @xmath108 , is dissipative and is responsible for the decoherence of @xmath12 .",
    "the other , @xmath109 , is due to the backactions of @xmath11 on @xmath12 .",
    "the degree of manifestations of @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the dynamics of @xmath12 depends on @xmath2 in comparison with @xmath3 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "@xmath108 dominates and @xmath109 only gives rise to a transient coherent oscillation of @xmath12 .",
    "the state of @xmath12 evolves to the ground state @xmath106 , which is coincident with the markovian result . if @xmath105 , the near resonant interaction between @xmath12 and @xmath11 results in @xmath108 and @xmath109 being comparable and counteract each other .",
    "these give rise to transient negative decay rates and asymptotical zero decay rate .",
    "the state of @xmath12 thus evolves asymptotically to some steady state , which is not the ground state @xmath106 . finally , when @xmath107 , @xmath109 dominates and governs the dynamics of @xmath12 .",
    "the decay rates of the system oscillate about some non - negative equilibrium position over a very long duration .",
    "this slight positivity guarantees an overall weak dissipative effect on the system dynamics .",
    "therefore , the state of @xmath12 eventually approaches the ground state with the entanglement oscillation persisting on for a very long time .",
    "the theory we have established is a non - perturbative description of the exact decoherence dynamics of a system of two single - mode optical fields .",
    "it can serve as a useful basic theoretical model in analyzing the non - markovian decoherence dynamics of optical fields employed in practical quantum information processing schemes .",
