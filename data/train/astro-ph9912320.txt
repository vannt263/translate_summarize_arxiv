    "black holes have been invoked in astrophysics to account for some galactic x - ray sources , and also for the engines that drive the active galactic nuclei .",
    "the physicists , however , have provided no way to visualize any realistic black hole .",
    "this paper remedies all of that .",
    "a scalar is derived which characterizes the spacetime curvature of a realistic rotating black hole , allowing one to  see \" the black hole .",
    "once in possession of the algebraic expression for the curvature , which is called the kretschmann scalar , any possible black hole can be visualized realistically .",
    "my derivation includes the possibility of electric charge on the black hole , although real black holes in the universe are very likely to be neutral .",
    "i  include the possibility of electric charge simply to ensure that _ all _ possible black holes are covered in my analysis .",
    "the derivation of the kretschmann scalar is simple in principle , but requires horrendous algebraic computation in practice . only the arrival of computer programs that do algebra makes the derivation possible .    to make the derivation transparent ( and particularly to clarify the _ meaning _ of the kretschmann scalar , in the context of a simpler example ; an example that , rightly or wrongly , most people will feel that they _ understand _ )",
    ", i will lay out my derivation first in terms of the corresponding derivation of the kretschmann scalar for a sphere ( which differs from an ordinary sphere , e.g. a  beachball , \" only in that it has no inside or outside ) .",
    "the curvature that is associated with _",
    "any _ geometry is fully specified by that geometry s riemann tensor , @xmath0 .",
    "the riemann tensor is computed from the metric of the space . for a sphere ,",
    "the metric is given by the functions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , where _ a _ is called the radius of the sphere .    from the specified metric , we compute , first , the connection , which is not itself a tensor : @xmath4 for a sphere , the non - zero components of the connection are @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .    with the connection in hand , we are in a position to compute the riemann tensor itself : @xmath7 there are only _ two _ non - zero components of the riemann tensor for a sphere : @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ". these two functions then _ fully _ characterize the curvature of the sphere .",
    "however , that is not how we normally think of the curvature of a sphere ( or of a beachball ) . instead , we think of its gaussian curvature . in its modern definition , the gaussian curvature _",
    "is obtained from the riemann tensor by contraction : first , @xmath10 , and then @xmath11 .",
    "the familiar final result for the sphere is @xmath12 ; this also applies to a beachball , which of course is a sphere that is embedded in three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "that would be the end of it , if we did not have black holes to consider ; but we do .",
    "we therefore apparently gild the lily by computing a _",
    "second _ scalar that is clearly also characteristic of the curvature : @xmath13 , @xmath14 for our sphere .",
    "this is the kretschmann scalar .",
    "we will shortly see why its computation is necessary , if we are to derive spacetime curvature for black holes .",
    "the vacuum field equations of general relativity are @xmath15 .",
    "the potential existence of black holes was implied from the first solution found , which was the schwarzschild solution , @xmath16    at the schwarzschild radius , @xmath17 , the radial coordinate and time exchange roles ( the singularity at that radius is merely a coordinate singularity that is of no physical significance ) .",
    "so ; _ how curved _ is spacetime at a black hole ? from the vacuum field equations , the reader can easily compute the gaussian curvature for herself _ without _ the aid of a computer : it is _ zero_.",
    "the gaussian curvature of spacetime at , and in , a black hole , is _ zero ! _ hence our need for the kretschmann scalar . for a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the kretschmann scalar is ( relatively ) easily computed to be @xmath18 ( e.g. , dinverno 1992 ) .",
    "i display the spacetime curvature of a schwarzschild black hole in figure 1 , as a dashed line .    until now",
    ", however , the kretschmann scalar has never been presented for a more sophisticated ( and more realistic ) black hole . to derive the kretschmann scalar for realistic black holes ( and indeed to carry out all my calculations involving tensors ) , i have created a fortran program which has as input a specified metric , and which has as output a script for _ mathematica _ to calculate all desired quantities .",
    "the script that my program creates for _ mathematica _ is a text file that is 1.3 megabytes in size . to calculate the kretschmann scalar for a general black hole on a macintosh quadra 700 ( which was the first machine that i used , in 1995 ) took 10.5 hours , using mathematica 2.2.2 . on my present g3 laptop ,",
    "the same calculation takes less than half an hour . and ,",
    "most recently an anonymous referee has taught me the trick of transforming my second coordinate via @xmath19 , which eliminates all trigonometric functions from the metric and results in my calculations , now , taking less than four minutes .",
    "the kerr - newman metric ( the metric for the most general possible black hole ) is    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    in the metric components above , the mass of the black hole is _ m _ , its angular momentum per unit mass is _ a _ , and its electric charge is _",
    "q_. the value of _ a _ can range from -1 to + 1 . note the presence of the cross term , @xmath25 , and note that it is the _ only _ term that is affected by the _ sign _ of _ a _",
    "( i.e. , is affected by the sense of rotation of the black hole ) .",
    "the presented form of the metric is boyer - lindquist coordinates , signature + 2 , organized for easy computer input . a more physically transparent form of the kerr metric is given by enderlein ( 1997 ) .    the result for the kretschmann scalar ( which is of astonishing simplicity , considering the immensity of the calculation that is required for its evaluation ) is @xmath26 \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which clearly reduces to the expected expression for a schwarzschild black hole if _ a _ and _ q _ are both zero . at the suggestion of an anonymous referee ,",
    "i have performed an additional test to be sure that my result is correct : i do find that the square of the weyl tensor , @xmath27 , under a general conformal transformation @xmath28 of the metric , as expected , turns out to be ( the same quantity)@xmath29 ; this test took 24 minutes to complete .    for simplicity in textbooks ,",
    "i propose that for black holes , my quantity _ k _ simply be called the _ spacetime curvature _ of the black hole .",
    "i now use this expression to provide a few illustrations of the  appearance \" of a realistic black hole .",
    "the reader , now in possession of the algebraic expression for the kretschmann scalar , can of course make as many additional illustrations as is desired .",
    "first , in figure  1 , i show the curvature of an electrically - charged non - rotating black hole of charge @xmath30 .",
    "the effect of the charge is to _ reduce _ the curvature , well into the interior of the black hole .    next ( figure 2 ) ,",
    "i show the most important ( because it is the only practical ) case , a rotating non - charged black hole .",
    "the most dramatic feature is the appearance of regions of negative curvature .",
    "we are most familiar with negative curvature from the famous two - dimensional space of gauss , bolyai , and lobachevsky ( gbl ) , which has gaussian curvature @xmath31 and kretschmann scalar @xmath32 .",
    "note that for gbl , the kretschmann scalar is _ positive ! _ it is clear that i have discovered a _ new kind _ of negative spacetime curvature , one that can not be  understood \" in terms of anything previously known , but which must simply be accepted on its own terms .",
    "finally , in figure 3 , for completeness , i show a picture of a rotating , _ electrically - charged _ black hole , and to _ clarify _ the effects of electric charge , in figure 4 i show the difference ( curvature of charged hole , _ minus _ curvature of uncharged hole ) ; a glance at the figure shows that the difference occurs in the heart of the black hole .",
    "all actual black holes in the universe are kerr black holes ; they are not schwarzschild black holes .",
    "while no black hole can be visualized in the literal meaning of that word , a vivid and highly meaningful picture of a black hole can be obtained by plotting the kretschmann scalar , which i have derived for the kerr - newman metric , which represents the most general possible black hole .",
    "thus , realistic black holes are , for the first time , brought within the vision of the scientist . and ,",
    "finally subjected to scrutiny ( figure 2 ) , _ realistic _ black holes turn out ( perhaps unsurprisingly ) to look unlike _ anything _ ever before seen ."
