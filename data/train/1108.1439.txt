    "furthermore , it encapsulates the aspect of characterizing the transitive closure of the digraph by means of a geometric dominance relation among the vertices . a dominance drawing @xmath2 of a planar @xmath1-graph @xmath3 is a drawing , such that for any two vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 there is a directed path from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in @xmath3 if and only if @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "an asymptotically optimal algorithm to obtain a two - dimensional dominance drawing of a bipartite graph whenever such a drawing exists was presented in @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the notion of dominance drawing _ dimension _ of a directed acyclic graph @xmath3 ( denoted as @xmath8(@xmath3 ) ) is defined as the value of the smallest @xmath9 for which a @xmath9-dimensional dominance drawing of @xmath3 can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "the family of planar @xmath1-graphs is a subclass of directed acyclic graphs for which a ( 2-dimensional ) dominance drawing can be efficiently computed in linear time @xcite .",
    "this is possible because planar @xmath1-graphs have dimension 2 .",
    "if a graph @xmath3 has @xmath10 then there is at least one pair of vertices @xmath11 such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath2 , while neither @xmath4 can reach @xmath5 , nor @xmath5 can reach @xmath4 .",
