    "azimuthal anisotropy of final state particles produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to measure the collective behavior of the dense particle system formed in such collisions @xcite .",
    "the strong azimuthal anisotropy , which has been observed in the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) of the brookhaven national laboratory , is also a signature of the formation of strongly interacting partonic matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics has been successful in predicting and explaining the measured elliptic flow in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "currently , a lot of effort is devoted for developing a description of the qcd - matter evolution in terms of dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "the recent results show that even a small viscosity can considerably decrease the elliptic flow @xcite",
    ".    however , all these ideal and viscous hydrodynamic studies tend to underestimate the elliptic flow in most central collisions .",
    "generally , the explanation for the deficit has been thought to be the initial state density fluctuations which have not been accounted for .",
    "in addition to taking into account the density fluctuations themselves , special care should be taken in computing the elliptic flow with respect to the same reference plane as in the data analysis .",
    "the initial state fluctuations can be implemented e.g. via a monte carlo glauber ( mcg ) model which makes possible to study the fluctuations of the initial matter eccentricity .",
    "geometric fluctuations in the positions of nucleons have been shown to increase the initial eccentricity , which is then suggested to translate into elliptic flow of final state particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reference plane plays a crucial role : the eccentricity is larger if one calculates it using the participant plane ( determined by the transverse positions of the participant nucleons and the beam axis ) instead of the reaction plane ( determined by the impact parameter and the beam axis ) .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , hydrodynamical calculations were performed using averaged initial density profiles which were obtained from mcg calculations .",
    "before averaging over the profiles , the transverse coordinate axes were rotated in each event so that the participant planes were on top of each other . in this manner it is possible to get an averaged initial profile that takes into account the eccentricity fluctuations in the initial state . for au+au collisions at rhic ,",
    "however , the effects of such plane rotations on the integrated @xmath0 were small .    while the above studies are steps to the right direction , it is obvious that without doing event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations , it is impossible to know how closely the computational participant plane corresponds to the physical event plane which is determined from the observed final state hadron momenta .",
    "so far , genuine event - by - event models where hydrodynamics is run event by event using fluctuating initial density profiles , have been presented in refs .  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a similar two - particle correlation ridge as observed in the experiments @xcite , is seen to form into the rapidity  azimuth - angle plane both in nexspherio @xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "this suggests that the puzzling ridge may well be another consequence of the fluctuations in the initial state .",
    "also higher flow coefficients have been measured @xcite and recent studies @xcite show that the initial state density fluctuations may play an important role in understanding the centrality dependence of the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "triangular flow arising from event - by - event fluctuations @xcite is also one of the things that should be studied further with event - by - event hydrodynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an event - by - event ideal hydrodynamics framework to study the following @xmath0-related problems : with ideal hydrodynamics using averaged initial states , _",
    "( i ) _ there is a @xmath0 deficit in central collisions , as discussed above ; _ ( ii ) _ the shape and centrality dependence of @xmath4 are unsatisfactory in that the @xmath1 slopes of @xmath0 easily become too steep and elliptic flow increases too much towards noncentral collisions ; _ ( iii ) _ elliptic flow is computed relative to the initial reaction plane or in the best case to the participant plane @xcite but not relative to the event plane , which is commonly used in the experiments ; _ ( iv ) _ one does not know how closely the event plane and the initial participant plane correspond to each other . a concrete illustration of the problems _ ( i)__(ii ) _ can be found in fig .",
    "7.5 . of ref .",
    "@xcite , and also in fig .  5 of our previous elliptic flow study @xcite .",
    "we will show how event - by - event ideal hydrodynamics , initiated with a fluctuating initial density profile obtained from a mc glauber model , and especially the determination of @xmath0 with respect to the event plane , conveniently solves the problem of the @xmath0 deficit in the most central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "simultaneously , we can significantly improve the agreement with the data for @xmath0 at all centrality classes up to 30 - 40% most central collisions in the typical applicability region of hydrodynamics , @xmath5  gev .",
    "this in turn has the very important implication that viscous effects can in fact be allowed to be smaller than previously thought .",
    "finally , we also show the correspondence between the event and participant planes and study the relation between the elliptic flow and initial eccentricity using different reference planes .",
    "the rest of the paper is constructed as follows : first , in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our framework for event - by - event hydrodynamics .",
    "details discussed there are our mcg model , computation of the fluctuating initial energy density profiles , mc modeling of thermal spectra of final state hadrons , and mc modeling of the resonance decays .",
    "we also try to discuss the points where our modeling could be improved .",
    "section  iii is devoted for defining the event plane and elliptic flow .",
    "also eccentricity issues are discussed there .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "iv and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we use here a mcg model to define the centrality classes and to form initial states with fluctuating density profiles .",
    "first , we distribute the nucleons in the colliding nuclei randomly using the standard , spherically symmetric , two - parameter woods - saxon ( ws ) nuclear density profile as the probability distribution .",
    "our ws parameters for the gold nucleus are @xmath6 for the radius and @xmath7 for the surface thickness . in the transverse @xmath8 plane",
    "the two nuclei are separated by an impact parameter @xmath9 between the centers of mass of the nuclei , which is determined by sampling the distribution @xmath10 in the region @xmath11 .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath12 coordinate is taken into account when sampling the initial nucleon positions but in what follows it does not play any role .",
    "nucleons @xmath13 and @xmath14 from different nuclei are then assumed to collide if their transverse distance is small enough , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "we apply here @xmath17 for au+au collisions at @xmath18 .",
    "we note that our simple mcg model fails to reproduce the correlations between the nucleons , since we use the ws distribution for determining the nucleon positions independently from each other .",
    "in @xcite it was observed that a realistic model , which accounts for nucleon correlations @xcite , can be well approximated using an exclusion radius which prevents nucleon overlap .",
    "using such radius , or giving a finite size for the nucleons @xcite , causes deviations from the ws distribution which should then be compensated by tuning of the parameters in the initially sampled ws distribution .    to keep our modeling as transparent as possible",
    "we , however , choose not to apply an exclusion radius or a nucleon size in our mcg model since according to ref .",
    "@xcite only a 10% uncertainty in the initial eccentricity can be expected , which is a much smaller effect than e.g. the overall uncertainties related to the choice of the initial density profiles .",
    "next , we define the centrality classes using the number of participant nucleons , @xmath19 , for simplicity .",
    "we have plotted the distribution of events as a function of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : centrality class ] .",
    "as indicated there , we slice our total event distribution in @xmath19 so that each @xmath19 interval corresponds to a centrality class which contains a certain percent of total events .",
    "the impact parameter may thus freely fluctuate within each centrality class .    .",
    "distribution of the number of participants is calculated from a monte carlo glauber model without a nucleon exclusion radius.,height=340 ]      in order to utilize the mcg - given initial state to start hydrodynamics , we must next somehow transform the positions of the wounded nucleons or binary collisions into energy density or entropy density",
    ". these would be the fluctuating event - by - event mcg analogues of the conventional ewn , ebc and swn , sbc @xcite average initial densities . for simplicity",
    ", we consider here just the ewn - type of profile and leave the profile fine tuning for future work .",
    "the energy density is now distributed in the @xmath8 plane around the wounded nucleons using a 2d gaussian as a smearing function , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a fixed overall normalization constant and @xmath22 is a free smearing parameter controlling the width of our gaussian . in each event",
    ", the impact parameter defines the direction of the @xmath23 axis and the origin of the @xmath8 plane is determined so that the energy - density weighted coordinate averages become @xmath24 .    for the hydrodynamical description to be meaningful",
    ", the initial state should not have too sharp density peaks . in our mcg model",
    "we have given an effective interaction radius @xmath25 for the colliding nucleons , which sets a natural order of magnitude for @xmath22 . to probe the sensitivity of our results to the initial state smearing ,",
    "we will consider two values , @xmath26 and 0.8  fm .",
    "with the current setup , we can not reduce @xmath22 further , as this would require a smaller step size in our hydrodynamical code , and consequently much more cpu time .",
    "one should then also develop a way to handle multiple separate freeze - out surfaces , see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsec : hydro ] .",
    "these developments we leave as future improvements .",
    "the reason to choose the energy density to be smeared rather than the entropy density , is mostly technical and due to the fact that our focus here is on understanding the transverse flow phenomena .",
    "since we now avoid using the equation of state in forming the initial energy density profiles in each event , we have a more direct control on the input energy density ( pressure ) gradients that drive the evolution of the transverse flow and its asymmetries . in our case",
    ", the total energy per rapidity unit in each event , @xmath27 , thus remains independent of @xmath22 , while the total entropy per rapidity unit and thereby also the final state multiplicity depend on @xmath22 .    for au+au collisions at @xmath18",
    ", we use the value @xmath28 . with this , we reproduce the initial total entropy of ref .",
    "@xcite when averaging over many initial states in central ( @xmath29 ) collisions when @xmath26 . motivated by the ekrt minijet ( final state ) saturation model @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , we fix the initial time to @xmath30 for all events .      for obtaining the ideal - fluid hydrodynamic evolution of the system , we solve the standard equations @xmath31 together with an equation of state ( eos ) which relates pressure with the energy density and net - baryon number density , @xmath32 .",
    "as we are interested in particle production at mid - rapidity , we assume the net - baryon density to be negligible .",
    "since the rapidity distributions of hadrons are approximately flat at mid - rapidities we can safely simplify our hydrodynamical equations by assuming longitudinal boost - invariance .",
    "we solve this ( 2 + 1)-dimensional numerical problem using the shasta algorithm @xcite which is also able to handle shock waves .",
    "as the equation of state ( eos ) , we choose the eos from laine and schrder @xcite . at high temperatures",
    "this eos has been matched with the lattice - qcd data and at low temperatures with a hadron resonance gas containing particles of mass @xmath33 .",
    "this eos has a  cross - over  transition from the qgp to the hadron gas .",
    "thermal spectra for hadrons are calculated using the conventional cooper - frye method @xcite , where particle emission from a constant - temperature surface @xmath22 is calculated according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the particle number - distribution function in momentum at a certain space - time location .",
    "the freeze - out temperature @xmath36  mev is fixed so that we reproduce the measured @xmath1 spectrum of pions @xcite when averaged initial states are considered .    our surface finding algorithm operates in the @xmath37-plane for all spatial azimuthal angles .",
    "currently , we can find only surfaces which go through @xmath38 .",
    "due to the initial state fluctuations there might simultaneously exist also other , disconnected , freeze - out surfaces which our algorithm does not recognize .",
    "we have checked that for the centrality classes and smearing parameters @xmath22 considered here , only a a few percent of the events actually contain such a surface . in any case",
    ", since these additional surfaces typically originate from a few - nucleon collisions , they contribute negligibly to particle production in not too peripheral au+au collisions . making @xmath22 smaller",
    "can also increase the number of disconnected freeze - out surfaces . to ensure the applicability of our framework",
    ", we prefer not to consider centrality classes more peripheral than 3040% or @xmath39 in the present study .    for the flow analysis ,",
    "we need individual final state particles . in generating these using the computed thermal spectrum as the probability distribution",
    ", we assume the total number of thermal particles in a rapidity unit to be fixed individually in each event . the transverse momentum @xmath40 for each particle is thus sampled from the distribution @xmath41 calculated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermals ] ) . due to the assumed boost - symmetry",
    ", we are not equipped to consider rapidity distributions , thus @xmath42 is sampled from a flat distribution in the interval @xmath43 .",
    "note that above we have neglected the fluctuations in the number of emitted thermal particles . in principle",
    "one could derive these fluctuations separately from the thermal distributions for each freeze - out surface element .",
    "however , it is not so clear how to treat the space - like parts of the surface in this case . since in the collisions considered here",
    "there are of the order of 1000 particles per unit rapidity , these fluctuations can in any case be expected to be negligible in comparison with the initial state fluctuations .",
    "once we have generated all the thermal hadrons , we still need take into account the strong and electromagnetic decays .",
    "we let the thermal resonances decay one by one using pythia 6.4 @xcite .",
    "some decay products can fall outside our rapidity interval @xmath44 . on the other hand",
    ", there would also be decay products arriving from @xmath45 which we do not consider here .",
    "we have checked that instead of increasing the width of our thermal particle rapidity window , to speed up the analysis , we can simply count all decay products into our rapidity acceptance regardless of their actual rapidity .",
    "our main goal is to compare the event - by - event hydrodynamic results with the ones obtained by more conventional non - fluctuating hydrodynamics initiated with averaged initial states .    for event - by event hydrodynamics ,",
    "we make 500 hydro runs in each centrality class .",
    "this amount of hydro runs seems enough for the hadron spectra and elliptic flow analysis . to increase statistics we make 20 final state events from every hydro run",
    ", thus we have 10 000 events in total . to check that using each hydro run 20 times is sensible ,",
    "we have checked that doing 250 hydro runs and 40 events from each leads to the same flow results .    to create an averaged initial state",
    ", we sum together 20 000 initial states generated by our mcg model",
    ". such large number of events is required since fluctuations near the edges of the system easily affect the final value of elliptic flow if the density profile is otherwise smooth .",
    "we then do one hydro run with the averaged initial state for each centrality class . to make a fare comparison with the event - by - event hydro results , we do the resonance decays and analysis using the same code for the averaged initial state case as for the event - by - event hydro case , making 10 000 final state events from this one hydro run .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons can be written as a fourier series , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hadron momentum s azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane defined by the impact parameter .",
    "the flow coefficients @xmath48 can then be computed from @xmath49    when we have fluctuations in the initial state , calculation of @xmath48 is not so straightforward . in the hydrodynamic",
    "runs , where we always know the direction of our impact parameter , we can calculate the elliptic flow with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "if we want to compare with experiments , we should use the same analysis methods and definitions as in the data analysis . in this work we use the event plane method @xcite which is a common way to calculate @xmath0 . since it is not ( yet )",
    "typically used in hydrodynamical calculations , let us briefly recapitulate the main points ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we first define an event flow vector @xmath50 for the @xmath51th harmonic .",
    "the event flow vector in the transverse plane is @xmath52 where we sum over every particle in the event and where @xmath47 is measured from the @xmath23 axis which is here fixed by the impact parameter . the event plane angle @xmath53 for each event is then defined to be @xmath54 with arctan placed into the correct quadrant .",
    "the `` observed '' @xmath48 is calculated with respect to the event planes obtained above , @xmath55 where the inner angle brackets denote an average over all particles @xmath13 in one event and the outer ones an average over all events . in order to remove autocorrelations ,",
    "the particle @xmath13 is excluded from the determination of the event flow vector when correlating it with the event plane .    since in our finite rapidity interval",
    "we have only a finite number of particles available for the event plane determination , the obtained event plane fluctuates from the `` true '' event plane .",
    "( in our event - by - event hydrodynamics , the true event plane in each event would correspond to the average event plane obtained by generating infinitely many final states from one hydro run . )",
    "the obtained @xmath56 is corrected using the event plane resolution for the harmonic @xmath51 @xmath57 where @xmath58 defines the true event plane and the angle brackets stand for an average over a large sample of events . because experimentally it is not possible to find the true event plane , the event plane resolution must be estimated .    in the two - subevents method , which also we will use ,",
    "each event is randomly divided into two equal subevents @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the event plane resolution for each of these subevents is then @xcite @xmath61 if the fluctuations from the true event plane are gaussian , one can analytically obtain the following result @xcite @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are modified bessel functions and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 referring to the number of particles .",
    "since we can calculate @xmath67 from the subevents , we can numerically solve @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ep resolution chi ] ) . because the number of particles in the subevents is half of those in the full events , @xmath69 , and we can calculate the resolution @xmath70 for the full events .",
    "finally , the flow coefficients are obtained as @xmath71    the elliptic flow results computed with this method are denoted here as @xmath72 .",
    "we also compute the elliptic flow from eq .   with respect to the reaction plane using both fluctuating and averaged initial states .",
    "in the reaction plane case we have no corrections coming from statistical fluctuations .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 where the averaging is done over the energy density profile of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps ] ) .    since the positions of wounded nucleons , however , fluctuate from one event to another , tilting the transverse coordinate axes suitably we can actually get a larger eccentricity than @xmath76 above .",
    "thus it is not so clear what the most correct reference plane should be .     calculated with averaged and fluctuating initial states varying the width of gaussian smearing .",
    "data are from the phenix collaboration @xcite.,height=340 ]        the reference plane that maximizes the initial eccentricity can be expected to correlate better with the event plane than the reaction plane . for this purpose , one may define the participant eccentricity @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 . in this case",

    "below , we present the results for pion spectra , elliptic flow , eccentricities and the correlation of the event and participant planes .",

    "the main result of this paper is that using event - by - event ideal hydrodynamics with mcg - generated fluctuating initial density profiles we can simultaneously reproduce the measured centrality dependence and the @xmath1 shape of charged - particle elliptic flow up to @xmath2  gev .",
    "also the measured pion spectra are quite well reproduced , although we have not made an effort to finetune the model parameters .",

    "nevertheless , our results demonstrate that event - by - event hydrodynamics with initial state fluctuations must be accounted for before a more reliable lower limit for viscosity can be obtained from elliptic flow data .",
    "we have shown that the definition of the reference plane with respect to which one determines @xmath0 , plays an important role especially in central collisions .",

    "the present work can obviously be improved in many ways . especially in event - by - event hydrodynamics the decoupling temperature may vary from event to event . instead of a fixed @xmath91 applied here , one could implement a dynamical freeze - out criterion as was done e.g. in ref .",
    "however , in order to improve upon the well - known problem of the proton @xmath1 spectra when partial chemical equilibrium is not applied , one could couple our hydro to a hadron cascade afterburner which would handle also the resonance decays @xcite .",
    "related to the initial state , one should more closely inspect the uncertainties due the assumed energy density smearing , which is an avoidable issue with event - by - event hydrodynamics .",
    "here we found out that @xmath0 remained fairly insensitive to gaussian smearing width while pion @xmath1 spectra were more sensitive to it towards larger @xmath1 . also other possible smearing functions should be studied .",
    "one should also consider a dynamical qcd - based model for the initial fluctuations , in which case also the absolute initial density profiles should be computable .",
    "these tasks , and considering the effects of fluctuations on other observables , we leave as future developments .",

    "<S> we also consider the relation of elliptic flow to the initial state eccentricity using different reference planes , and discuss the correlation between the physical event plane and the initial participant plane . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that event - by - event hydrodynamics with initial state fluctuations must be accounted for before a meaningful lower limit for viscosity can be obtained from elliptic flow data . </S>"
