    "liquid crystals in confined geometries ( such as plates , droplets , porous glasses , and polymer networks ) constitute an interesting class of thermodynamic systems both from experimental and theoretical viewpoints @xcite . in particular , the generic critical wetting phenomena @xcite , studied in a large number of scalar order - parameter systems ,",
    "are expected to acquire some new interesting feartures near the bulk nematic - isotropic coexistence temperature @xmath0 arising from the complicated nematic order parameter ( a symmetric traceless second - rank tensor ) . in confined nematic liquid crystals",
    "the critical wetting transition usually appears as a _ continuous interface delocalization transition _ at bulk coexistence , when the nematic - isotropic interface critically intervenes into the bulk as @xmath0 is approached .",
    "typical features of a critical interface delocalization transition are the diverging interface position and the existence of a _ soft fluctuation mode _ directly connected to the interface position fluctuations ( for a review see , e.g. , ref . ) . at a mean - field level and in a uniform - director approximation , the macroscopic landau - de gennes",
    "approach@xcite reproduces the well - known critical wetting results originally established for scalar order - parameter systems , so that many known results can be directly applied to nematic liquid crystals ( for a review on wetting transitions in liquid crystals see ref . and references therein ) .    concerning the fluctuation dynamics , the situation in systems with an orientational rong - range order might be substantionally changed .",
    "generally , the nematic order - parameter fluctuations are characterized by five independent fluctuation fields , one of them being related to the scalar order - parameter fluctuations , whereas the other four fields describe the transverse fluctuations of the nematic director .",
    "therefore , an interesting issue is to examine nematic director fluctuations in a regime of critical wetting , as one can expect that some peculiarities of normal - mode director fluctuations will reflect the criticalities",
    ". published experimental works show quite different elementary excitation spectra , ranging from very small to very large relaxation rates as compared to bulk excitation spectra @xcite . up to now",
    ", relatively small number of theoretical studies treating the fluctuation dymamics in confined liquid crystals near the bulk coexistence have been published .",
    "recently , ziherl and zumer@xcite have published a work dealing with order - parameter pretransitional fluctuations above @xmath0 under the condition of a strong homeotropic anchoring of the nematic director .",
    "apart from the typical soft fluctuation mode , reflecting the interface position fluctuations , their numerical analysis also indicated slow uniaxial director modes located close to the substrate . in the discussed work the critical wetting regime",
    "is ensured by a strong scalar order - parameter anchoring at the surface , describing substrates enhancing the nematic order .",
    "another extreme type of substrate anchoring yet allowing for a critical wetting regime , called here _ weak - anchoring limit _ , corresponds to substrates strongly suppressing the nematic arrangement .",
    "for example , substrates treated by the @xmath1-evaporation technique may produce such disorder effects . in this case ( and under some additional conditions discussed below ) , it is the isotropic phase which wets the wall , so that one may expect different behavior of the normal fluctuation modes .",
    "a goal of the present work is to compare the fluctuation mode dynamics based on such extremely different substrate potentials .",
    "the emphasis is especially on substrates strongly suppressing the nematic order .",
    "a characteristic feature of the weak anchoring is the possible critical behavior of the surface scalar order parameter by itself .",
    "this may also be of importance in the critical wetting experiments , as the finite size effects frequently mask the weak logarithmic divergence in the interface position ( characteristic for short - ranged substrate potentials ) @xcite .",
    "as argued below , in the weak - anchoring limit , when the isotropic phase wets completely the substrate , in addition to the scalar order - parameter soft excitation , _ gapped biaxial director modes _ located in the presurface quasi - isotropic layer can exist . basically , the low - energy spectrum of these local biaxial excitations is determined by the mean - field interface position .",
    "since the latter is logarithmically divergent at @xmath2 , the excitation spectrum shows a characteristic cusplike behavior in that limit , as found also numerically in the strong - achoring case @xcite .",
    "the cited results are based on the gaussian approximation and suggest constant nematic - director mean - field configurations , when the director fluctuations decouple from the `` dangerous '' scalar order - parameter modes . in principle , a series of effects can invalidate the above two approximations . at a first place , higher - order fluctuation effects may be of importance since @xmath3 is the upper critical spatial dimension for a critical wetting transition . in particular",
    ", it is well - known that the effective nematic - isotropic interfacial width diverges in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "clearly , this latter divergence can modify the local excitation spectra .",
    "however , close enough to @xmath0 the simple gaussian picture of local director excitations is still valid , since the effective interfacial width is much smaller than the domain thickness ( see below ) . as to the inhomogeneous director configurations , they can result from many sources , the main effect being the appearence of intermode couplings . as an example",
    ", we will discuss below order - electricity effects , as the problem is characterized by strong scalar order - parameter variations in the interfacial region .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the surface landau - de gennes free - energy functional and the free - energy substrate potentials describing the strong- and weak - anchoring limits . for uniform - director configurations , we present the mean - field scalar order - parameter profiles which are later used to fix the relevant areas of the phase diagrams . in section iii",
    "we study the gaussian order - parameter fluctuations .",
    "the emphasis is on the properties of the local nematic - director excitations in the two cases of substrate anchorings and in complete wetting regimes .",
    "the role of interface position fluctuations and order electricity effects are also analyzed here .",

    "thus , in the weak - anchoring case _ bound biaxial director modes _ located in the persurface domain can appear . on the other hand ,",
    "the uniaxial director modes , being gapless goldstone modes in the bulk nematic phase , are controlled by the monotonically decreasing potential @xmath180 , so that they will be delocalized all over the sample . in the vicinity of @xmath0",
    "the low - energy levels of the local biaxial modes can easily be obtained analytically by use of the same procedue applied above to the uniaxial excitations in the regime of strong anchoring .",
    "now the potential @xmath210 is simplified as @xmath211 ( for @xmath111 ) , and @xmath212 ( for @xmath213 ) .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath26 for the biaxial field @xmath214 , as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , reads @xmath215_{z=0}=0.\\ ] ] using the same arguments as in the previous case , one finds the excitation energies @xmath216 , where the parameter @xmath185 now satisfies the followig implicit equation : @xmath217 the number of localized modes @xmath187 is fixed by the condition @xmath218 , and @xmath187 also depends on the reduced temperature @xmath91 through the function @xmath197 .",
    "using the asymptotic expression @xmath219 , one gets the following result in the limit @xmath118 : @xmath220 we see that in the limit @xmath118 the local biaxial modes are stongly softened as compared to the bulk biaxial fluctuations in the nematic phase : for every @xmath221 , the energies @xmath222 change from @xmath223 ( the gap in the bulk nematic phase ) to @xmath224 ( the gap in the bulk isotropic phase ) .",
    "as expected , the local biaxial mode spectrum is gapped at @xmath2 .",
    "since the upper critical spatial dimension for a critical wetting transition is @xmath3@xcite , higher order fluctuation effects are not excluded . indeed , as discussed above , the singular part of the mean - field free energy in the regime of complete wetting behaves like @xmath225 , eq . ( [ fss ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the one - loop fluctuation contribution to the free energy is related to the lowest soft mode @xmath172 since the energies of the excited states of eq .",
    "( [ ne ] ) are separated from @xmath226 with a finite gap .",
    "using this fact , it is easy to see that the fluctuation part of the free energy is @xmath227 , so that it compares to the singular part of the mean - field free energy .",
    "remember that for uniform - director configurations the scalar order - parameter field @xmath152 is decoupled from the director fields in the gaussian approximation .",
    "therefore , in this approximation most of the results known from the scalar theory@xcite can be applied to nematic systems without changes . however , the fluctuation mode @xmath198 will effectively disturbe the studied local director excitations .",
    "it is easy to see this qualitatively if remember some of the fluctuation effects connected to the soft mode @xmath172 , originally obtained in a context of the scalar order - parameter theory .",
    "at the first place , it can be shown that this mode produces the singularities in the correation function @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the characteristic length of the scalar order - parameter correlations parallel to the surface .",
    "thus , there are critical long - range correlations of the scalar order - parameter fluctuations parallel to the surface ( capillary waves ) .",
    "another criticality connected to @xmath172 is the predicted divergence of the interfacial width . denoting by @xmath230 the local interface position",
    ", it can be shown that the characteristic interface thickness @xmath231 diverges as @xmath87 according the asymptotic form @xmath232@xcite .",
    "thise critical increase of the effective interface width , clearly , will effectively change the potential @xmath180 in eq .",
    "( [ ne ] ) which controls the director excitation spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the threatment of the local fluctuation modes used throughout the paper remains valid , since close enough to @xmath0 the effective interfacial width will be much smaller than the characteristic domain thickness .",
    "there is a series of issues which might invalidate the uniform - director appoximation suggested in the above analysis@xcite .",
    "the order electricity @xcite belongs to this series .",
    "since the nematic - isotropic interface is characterized by a strong variation of the scalar order parameter , one can expect that the order - electricity effect will play an important role in the wetting phenomena .",
    "let us concentrate on the strong - anchorig limit , when the nematic director is strongly anchored along the normal to the surface .",
    "the inhomogeneity in the profile function @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ u+ ] ) , generates along the axis @xmath18 the electric polarization field @xmath233 , where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the order - electric coefficients @xcite . denoting by @xmath236 the polar angle of the director @xmath237 , it is easy to see that @xmath238 since the free - energy density term @xmath239 , connected with @xmath240 , mixes @xmath169 and @xmath241 : @xmath242 here @xmath243 is the @xmath244 component of the dielectric tensor and @xmath245 is the @xmath18 component of the induced electic field .",
    "combaining the last equation with the elastic term in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) , one finds the result that the elastic constant @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) is effectively renormalized as @xmath246 \\left ( r_1\\cos^2\\theta+r_2\\right)^2 $ ] . to find the function @xmath247 we will follow the arguments of ref . ,",
    "applicable in our case for @xmath87 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the polar angle @xmath248 , as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) , reads @xmath249 as shown above , @xmath250 is a @xmath251-like function centered at @xmath74 , eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) .",
    "thus , the function @xmath247 can be approximated with a linear function in the region @xmath252 , excluding the vicinity of the interface and , possibly , of the surface .",
    "since the interfacial energy is proportional to @xmath253 , the minimum condition for this energy @xmath254 also defines the average polar angle at the interface @xmath255@xcite .",
    "we do not consider here possible deviations from the linear behavior of @xmath256 close to the substrate @xcite .",
    "therefore , as @xmath87 the inhomogeneous director state is characterized by the polar angle @xmath257    the inhomogeneous director state described above can generate several changes in the fluctuation mode dynamics . since the local base tensors are now coordinate - dependent , @xmath258 , the normal mode equations ( [ ne ] ) are coupled . in particular",
    ", there is a coupling between the longitudinal scalar order - parameter field @xmath259 and the transverse director fluctuations @xmath176 and @xmath260 .",
    "the mode coupling is , however , asymptotically small , as it is controlled by the small parameter @xmath261 .",
    "as the interaction decreases logarithmically , the effect of order - electicity mode coupling can play an important role in real experiments .",
    "in this article the emphasis was on specific features of the presurface fluctuation mode dynamics in nematic liquid crystals , arising in a regime of critical wetting when the system is close to the nematic - isotropic phase transition temperature .",
    "the importance of substratate anchoring for the director mode dynamics is demonstrated by use of two extreme types of surface free - energy potentials .",
    "our key results are as follows : in the case of uniform - director mean - field configurations and for a homeotropic director anchoring , surface free - energy potentials strongly suppressing the orientational order favor the appearence of bound biaxial nematic - director fluctuation modes located in the domain occupied by the wetting thermodynamic phase . instead , substrate forces which enhance the orientational order promote bound uniaxial modes in the presurface domain .",
    "close to the phase coexistence temperature both types of local director excitations are strongly softened ( as compared to their bulk counterparts ) and acquire characteristic cusplike low - energy spectra which are directly connected to the critical behavior of the mean - field interface position . since the physics of these local excitations closely reflects the wetting critical behavior , they can be used as a tool to examine the critical wetting phenomena and the presurface interactions in nematic liquid crystals .",
    "we have considered one of the possible reasons for the experimentally observed different spectra of elementary exitations , ranging from very small to very large ( as compared to the bulk ) relaxation rates .",
    "clearly , there could be a number of other factors modifying substantially the director exitation spectra .",
    "we have already briefly discussed two of them , i.e. , the higher - order fluctuation effects and order electricity effects . as to the interface position fluctuations , in the upper spatial critical dimension @xmath3 they lead to a divergence of the effective interface width .",
    "thus , the local excitation specta can be disturbed , as the potentials @xmath262 will be effectively changed as well . in addition , the fluctuation effects in @xmath3 are known @xcite to depend on the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the bulk correlation length of the phase attracted to the wall and @xmath265 is the surface tension of the free interface .",
    "it will be interesting to see the role of this parameter in different liquid crystal materials .",
    "as to the order - electricity effects , they are expected to play an important role in the real experiments due to the strong variation of the scalar order parameter in the interfacial region .",
    "the coupling of the normal gaussian modes is the main effect of the inhomogeneity .",
    "it is important that in this case the director fluctuation modes are coupled with the `` dangerous '' scalar order - parameter soft mode , so that the picture of the gaussian fluctuation dynamics can be importantly disturbed .    in conclusion ,",
    "the finite - size effects , the long - ranged substrate interactions , and the external electromagnetic fields belong to the class of factors that will modify the discussed local fluctuation mode dynamics .",
    "clearly , these issues deserve future studies .",
