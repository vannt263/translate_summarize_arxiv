    "over the last few years , increasing observational evidence has gathered in favour of the existence of `` magnetars '' , i.e. neutron stars ( nss ) endowed with an ultra - strong magnetic field ( @xmath3  g ) , much higher than the critical threshold at which quantum electro - dynamical ( qed ) effects become important ( @xmath4  g ) .",
    "the existence of these objects has been first proposed in the early 90s by @xcite and @xcite , who suggested that , soon after the core collapse following the supernova explosion , convective motions can strongly amplify the seed magnetic field via helical dynamo action .",
    "the magnetar model , initially developed to describe the phenomenology of the so - called soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , namely the emission of strong bursts , the fast spin period evolution and the persistent x - ray luminosity , is currently believed to successfully reproduce the properties of another class of peculiar nss , the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) . although alternative models , invoking accretion from a fossil disc , are not completely ruled out by observations as yet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the recent detection of sgr - like bursts from five axps @xcite has strengthened the connection between the two groups and pushed forward the interpretation of axps as magnetars .",
    "both classes of sources , sgrs and axps , are characterized by spin periods in a narrow range ( 512 s ) , a typical persistent x - ray luminosity of @xmath510@xmath6 , no evidence for doppler shifts in the light curve , lack of bright optical companions ( favouring an interpretation in terms of isolated objects ) , and a spin - down in the range 10@xmath710@xmath8 . in particular",
    ", the magnetar scenario appears promising in providing an alternative mechanism ( namely the ultra - strong magnetic field ) to power their high x - ray luminosity , which can not be otherwise explained in terms of more conventional processes , as accretion from a binary companion or injection of rotational energy in the pulsar wind / magnetosphere .",
    "besides , measurements of period and period derivative , assuming that spin - down is associated to magneto - dipolar losses , are strongly suggestive of the presence of an ultra - strong magnetic field , @xmath9 .",
    "the soft x - ray spectra of axps are generally well described by a two component model , consisting of a blackbody with @xmath10 0.40.5kev , and a power - law with photon index @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in some cases",
    ", sgrs spectra have been fit with a single power - law component , but recent deep observations showed that , also for these sources , a blackbody component is often required @xcite . despite the fact that the blackbody plus power - law model has been routinely applied to magnetar candidate spectra for several years , attempts to provide a physical interpretation for these two components have just begun .",
    "recently it has been proposed that this phenomenological spectral model mimics a situation in which soft seed photons emerging , for instance , from the neutron star surface are boosted to higher energies by efficient resonant cyclotron scattering ( rcs ) from magnetospheric charged particles , leading to the formation of a power - law high - energy tail .",
    "the basic idea has been discussed by @xcite ( tlk in the following ) , who suggested that a possible difference between sgrs / axps and standard radio - pulsars is that in the former the internal magnetic field is highly twisted , up to @xmath12 times the external dipole .",
    "stresses imparted to the star crust by the strong toroidal component of the internal magnetic field cause the crust to deform .",
    "this produces , in turn , a displacement of the footpoints of the external magnetic field lines with the net result that , at intervals , the external ( initially dipolar ) field may acquire a toroidal component , i.e. it may twist up as well .",
    "twisted magnetospheres are threaded by currents , substantially in excess of the goldreich - julian current .",
    "as shown by tlk , charge carriers may provide large optical depth to resonant cyclotron scattering so that soft ( thermal ) photons produced at the star surface gain energy through repeated collisions with the moving charges .",
    "since the electron distribution is spatially extended , and the resonant cross section depends on the _ local _ value of @xmath13 , it is expected that repeated scatterings lead to the formation of a high - energy tail , instead of a narrow cyclotron line .",
    "at least qualitatively , this scenario may also explain the correlation between spectral hardening , luminosity and increase in bursting / glitching activity that has been recently discovered in the long - term evolution of a few sources @xcite .",
    "the problem of computing the x - ray spectrum emerging from twisted magnetospheres has been previously tackled using a simplified one - dimensional approach by @xcite , and a systematic application to x - ray data has been presented by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , 3-d monte carlo calculations have been presented by @xcite , although these spectra have never been applied to fit x - ray observations .",
    "both these investigations treat resonant cyclotron scattering in the non - relativistic regime , and neglect electron recoil , i.e. use the resonant cross section in the particle frame in the ( magnetic ) thomson limit .",
    "interestingly , thanks to _ integral _ , it has been recently found that axps and sgrs exhibit very hard high - energy tails ( @xmath14 ) which can extend up to @xmath15  kev @xcite .",
    "this discovery come somewhat as a surprise , being the persistent spectra of these sources below @xmath12 kev rather soft , and changed our view of magnetars , suggesting that their luminosity might well be dominated by the hard , rather than soft , x - ray component .",
    "the origin of such high energy tails is presently unclear , but , again , most of the scenarios proposed so far invoke emission from magnetospheric particles .",
    "quite recently , @xcite discussed how soft gamma - rays may be produced in a twisted magnetosphere , suggesting two different mechanisms : either thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the surface region heated by returning currents , or synchrotron emission from pairs created higher up ( @xmath16 100 km ) in the magnetosphere .",
    "however , an alternative possibility is that the high - energy tails are again created by resonant magnetic compton up - scattering of soft x - ray photons . in order to boost efficiently soft photons up to a few hundred kevs , scattering must occur off a non - thermal population of relativistic electrons ( or pairs ) , possibly located close to the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "a quantitative calculation of the expected spectra , which necessarily requires a correct description of relativistic effects , has not been put forward as yet .    in this paper , the first in a series devoted to investigate the x-/soft @xmath0-ray persistent spectrum of magnetar candidates , we lay out the physical bases of our model and present a monte carlo code which is used to follow the spectral modifications as the soft seed photons get progressively up - scattered in the magnetosphere of an ultra - magnetized neutron star .",
    "our present goal is to test , by direct comparison with observations , if rcs spectra are capable of accounting for the observed properties of the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath17  kev ) of sgrs / axps . to this end",
    ", we adopt a non - relativistic ( thomson ) description for the scattering process . however , the numerical scheme is completely general and is explicitly designed to incorporate the fully qed cross sections and to deal with more complex magnetic configurations .",
    "the former , together with an application to the hard x - ray tails detected by _",
    "integral _ , will be the scope of forthcoming papers ( nobili , turolla & zane in preparation ) .",
    "in many respects the present investigation follows an approach similar to that of @xcite , and we will refer to this paper for some useful expressions .",
    "the two treatments , however , differ in a number of ways .",
    "in particular , the present model includes the angular and frequency dependence of seed photons in a more general way and a different prescription for the current velocity distributions .",
    "differences and similarities between the two methods will be discussed along the paper , when relevant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ model ] we lay out and scrutinize the physical bases of our model .",
    "the monte carlo method and its coding is described in ",
    "[ mc ] , while in  [ results ] we present the computed spectra and discuss their properties .",
    "the implementation in xspec of our model is described in  [ arch ] where also a preliminary fit is reported .",
    "discussion follows in  [ disc ] .",
    "in this section we discuss in some detail the main ingredients used in our computation of the soft ( @xmath1810 kev ) x - ray spectrum emitted by magnetar candidates .",
    "the first ingredient of our computation is a prescription for the magnetic field geometry .",
    "monte carlo techniques are suitable for handling complicated 3d configurations , and our code is completely general from this point of view . however , for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we restrict ourselves to the axially symmetric twisted magnetosphere configurations studied by tlk , in which case the ( numerical ) solution of the magnetostatic , force - free equilibrium is straightforward .",
    "accordingly , we report here only those expressions that are needed to facilitate the reading of this paper , and refer to tlk for all details .",
    "the starting point is the force - free equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the current and the external field respectively . under the assumption of axial symmetry",
    ", this equation can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 the flux parameter .",
    "a major simplification arises by restricting to self - similar configurations , @xmath24 , in which case the problem reduces to the solution of a second order eigenvalue differential equation for @xmath25 , that can be solved numerically for each value of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the latter univocally fixes the magnetic configuration , a part for a scale factor @xmath27 ( see below ) .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen in such a way that the resulting axially - symmetric configuration corresponds to a core - centered , twisted , dipolar field ( see  [ disc ] for a discussion ) .",
    "the polar components of the magnetic field are then ( see again tlk for all details )    @xmath28 ^{1/2 } f^{1/p}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the constant @xmath29 is an eigenvalue which depends on @xmath30 only , @xmath31 is the neutron star radius and @xmath27 is the value of the magnetic field at the pole .",
    "the net twist angle is defined as    @xmath32    and is a function of the parameter @xmath30 . as a consequence ,",
    "either @xmath30 or @xmath33 can be used to label each model in the sequence .",
    "once the magnetic structure is known , in the force - free approximation the spatial density of the magnetospheric particles is automatically fixed by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the average charge velocity ( in units of @xmath36 ; see below ) .",
    "the above expression gives the co - rotation charge density of the space charge - limited flow of ions and electrons from the ns surface , that , due to the presence of closed loops in a twisted field , is much larger than the goldreich - julian density , @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that , while a space charge - limited flow with @xmath38 requires currents flowing in opposite directions from the two poles , for the case at hand there is a well defined flow direction which is the same from north to south .",
    "this breaks the symmetry between the two star hemispheres , and implies that the observed spectrum will be different when viewed from the north or the south pole . clearly , because of charge neutrality , the electron current must be balanced by ions flowing in the opposite direction .",
    "however , ions are heavier , they are not lifted much in the magnetosphere and tend to move closer to the star surface .",
    "photons may scatter off ions , but this is likely to give rise at most to a narrow absorption feature at the ion cyclotron energy ( see tlk and @xcite ) . for this reason",
    ", the ion current is not considered here , together with pair creation , that can further complicate the relation between charge and current density by introducing bidirectional flows ( see  [ disc ] for a discussion ) . in a genuinely static twist ( @xmath39 )",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are orthogonal .",
    "this implies that the voltage drop between the footpoints of a field line vanishes since @xmath40 , so that there is no force that can extract particles from the surface and lift them against gravity thus initiating the current @xmath41 requested to support the twist . however , as discussed in @xcite , once implanted , the twist has necessary to decay precisely to provide the potential drop required to accelerate charges .",
    "a non - vanishing @xmath42 is maintained by self - induction and the twist evolution is regulated by the balance between the conduction current @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 the magnetosphere becomes charge starved and @xmath42 grows at the expenses of the magnetic field , injecting more charges into the magnetosphere . on the other hand , when @xmath47 the field decreases reducing the current .",
    "the magnetosphere is then in dynamical ( quasi)equilibrium with @xmath48 over a timescale @xmath49 , where @xmath50 a few years is the twist decay time @xcite .",
    "the second key ingredient is the velocity distribution of the magnetospheric charges .",
    "this is a crucial and still largely unexplored issue ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* and  [ disc ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , in a strong magnetic field the electron distribution is expected to be largely anisotropic : @xmath51 stream freely along the field lines , while they are confined in a set of cylindrical landau levels in the plane perpendicular to @xmath21 . in order to mimic such scenario ,",
    "we assume a 1-d maxwellian distribution at a given temperature @xmath52 , superimposed to a bulk motion with velocity @xmath53 , as measured in the stellar frame .",
    "the ( invariant ) distribution function turns out to be    @xmath54    where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the modified bessel function of the first order and @xmath58 is the momentum distribution function .",
    "we consider @xmath52 and @xmath59 as free parameters in our model , and , although this is definitely a simplification , we assume that both do not depend on position .",
    "this expression differs from that used by @xcite ( their equation [ 19 ] ) inasmuch they do not include the effects of collective ( bulk ) velocity ( which is necessary to reproduce the current flow ) , but only those of the @xmath51 local velocity distribution ( either thermal , as in the present case , or non - thermal ) . in other words , we assume that electrons move isothermically along the field lines but , at the same time , they receive the same boost from the electric field . even in the lack of any detailed information about the charge accelerating mechanisms",
    ", we consider our choice more realistic .",
    "scattering off free electrons in the presence of a strong magnetic field has been extensively treated in the literature .",
    "the non - relativistic ( @xmath60 ) expressions for the scattering cross sections in the thomson limit ( i.e. neglecting electron recoil ) were derived by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the complete qed compton cross sections have been presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the scattering cross section depends on the incident photon polarization state and , in general , it must be computed by summing over the ( infinite ) virtual intermediate landau states .",
    "moreover , proper account has to be made for the electron spin transition and for the possibility that scattering leaves the electron in an arbitrary excited state ( raman scattering ) .",
    "this leads to quite cumbersome expressions ( see e.g @xcite ) , even if one restricts to the resonant part of the completely differential cross section . on the other hand , under the typical conditions expected in a twisted magnetosphere , soft photons ( @xmath61 kev ) will undergo resonant scattering when @xmath62 and this happens only where the field has decayed to a value @xmath63 .",
    "electron recoil starts to be important when the photon energy in the electron rest frame becomes comparable to the electron rest energy .",
    "if @xmath0 is the mean electron lorentz factor , this occurs at typical energies @xmath64 .",
    "assuming mildly relativistic particles , the previous limit implies that conservative scattering should provide good accuracy up to photon energies of some tens of kev .",
    "this , together with the fact that resonant scattering occurs in regions where @xmath60 , makes the use of the ( much simpler ) non - relativistic ( thomson ) cross section adequate .",
    "we anticipate here that , albeit supported by physical considerations , this provides only a zeroth level description and a more thorough treatment demands for the full qed cross section , as it is discussed in more detail later on ( see  [ disc ] ) .",
    "a further simplification arises because , under the typical conditions encountered in the magnetosphere , vacuum polarization dominates over plasma effects . in this situation ,",
    "the two ( ordinary and extraordinary ) normal modes are linearly polarized .",
    "since radiative de - excitation occurs on a very short timescale , one can safely assume that the electron is initially in the ground state .",
    "for a particle initially at rest , the non - relativistic scattering cross sections at resonance are easily derived from the general expression given e.g. by @xcite by performing the substitution @xmath65 where @xmath66 accounts for the finite transition lifetime of the excited state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since in the present case it is @xmath67 kev , the resonance peak is so narrow and prominent that non - resonant contributions to the cross section are negligible .",
    "one can therefore take the limit @xmath68 which results in @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is the photon angle before ( after ) the scattering and @xmath72 is the classical electron radius . here and in the following the index 1 ( 2 ) stands for the ordinary ( extraordinary ) mode .    upon normalization ,",
    "the previous expressions give the probability that an incident photon with polarization state @xmath73 and direction @xmath70 is scattered at angle @xmath71 with polarization state @xmath43 .",
    "the total cross sections for separated processes are easily computed by integrating the previous expressions over all outgoing photon angles    @xmath74    the total cross section for scattering of an incident ordinary ( extraordinary ) photon is obtained by summing the first ( second ) pair of expressions in equation ( [ totcross ] ) .",
    "finally , in order to determine the photon direction after scattering ( i.e. the two angles @xmath71 , @xmath75 ) in the monte carlo code , the following integrals are required    @xmath76      the scattering cross sections discussed in  [ cross - sections ] hold in the electron rest frame ( erf ) .",
    "in particular , both the photon ( @xmath77 ) and the cyclotron ( @xmath78 ) frequency entering expressions ( [ difcross])([partcross ] ) are evaluated in the erf . in the case of a charge moving with velocity @xmath79 and lorentz factor @xmath0 with respect to a frame attached to the star",
    ", the total cross sections ( eq . [ [ totcross ] ] ) take the form    @xmath80    where @xmath81 @xmath70 is the angle between the incident photon direction and the particle velocity as measured in the erf and @xmath82 is the cosine of the same angle but measured in the stellar frame .",
    "the latter two quantities are related by the usual transformation @xmath83 since particles are moving along @xmath21 , the magnetic field is unaffected by the lorentz transformation , and the value of @xmath13 as measured in the stellar frame can be used to compute the cyclotron frequency @xmath78 in the erf .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath77 in eqs .",
    "( [ totcrosslab ] ) is now the photon frequency in the stellar frame .",
    "the scattering optical depth for a photon which travels a distance @xmath84 in the magnetosphere is @xmath85 where the factor @xmath86 appears because of the change of reference between the erf and the stellar frame , @xmath87 is the ( velocity integrated ) particle density and @xmath88 is the ( normalized ) momentum distribution as defined in equations ( [ magcurr ] ) and ( [ distribf ] ) .    the indices @xmath73 and @xmath43 refer to the initial and final photon polarization states and @xmath89 $ ] is the charge velocity spread . as pointed out by @xcite , the integral in equation ( [ tau ] ) can be readily calculated by exploiting the @xmath90-function in the scattering cross section . denoting by    @xmath91\\ ] ]    the two roots of the quadratic equation @xmath92 , the @xmath90-function in frequency can be transformed into a @xmath90-function in velocity @xmath93 accordingly , the total scattering depth can be expressed as @xmath94 and @xmath95 for photons initially in the polarization state 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "these expressions are analogous to those derived by @xcite , although their equation ( 33 ) seems to contain an error .",
    "the spatial distribution of charged particles @xmath87 depends , in fact , on their average velocity , i.e. the speed at which charge carriers flow , and not on the velocity of the single particle . for this reason @xmath87",
    "is not evaluated at @xmath96 , but at @xmath35 which is , in general , a function of position ( see also  [ currents ] ) .",
    "moreover , their equation ( 13 ) contains an unexpected factor @xmath97 in place of @xmath78 .",
    "the reason for this is obscure since the ratio @xmath98 turns out to be independent of both the magnetic field and photon energy .    once the initial photon polarization , energy and direction have been fixed , equation ( [ tautot_ord ] ) , or ( [ tautot_extr ] ) , is integrated along the photon path until a scattering occurs ( see  [ scatdepth ] ) .",
    "although general relativistic effects are certainly important , here we restrict ourselves to newtonian gravity and assume that photons move along straight lines between two successive scatterings .",
    "proper inclusion of null geodesics in a schwarzschild space - time , albeit conceptually simple , turned out to be computationally quite costly and we decided to dismiss it . as it is apparent from equation ( [ delta_beta ] ) , resonant scattering may occur only when the roots @xmath99 are real , i.e. only if @xmath100 . since @xmath78 depends ( through @xmath13 ) on position alone , at every point in the magnetosphere the previous condition discriminates those pairs of photon energy and angle for which scattering is possible @xcite . in case",
    "the particle velocity is always of a given sign ( charge carriers all positive or negative ) , only the roots @xmath99 with the same sign are meaningful . if there exist two roots with the right sign ( i.e. both are positive or negative ) , the criterion for selecting onto which particle ( the one with velocity @xmath101 or @xmath102 ) the photon actually scatters is discussed in  [ scatdepth ] .",
    "primary photons are assumed to be emitted by the cooling surface of the neutron star .",
    "although , up to now , no detailed model for surface emission from a magnetar has been presented , it seems unlikely that the spatial and energy distribution of the surface - emitted photons are the same as in ordinary cooling neutron stars . in particular , being the surface heated by returning currents ( e.g. tlk ) , the surface temperature is expected to be inhomogeneous ( with the equatorial belt hotter than the polar regions ) and it is unclear if a standard ( i.e. in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium ) atmosphere can be present on the top of a magnetar ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the wake of this , in order to keep our treatment as general as possible , we do not prescribe an a priori surface temperature distribution ( see  [ photem ] ) . in the present version of the code ,",
    "the initial energy distribution is taken to be planckian for either ordinary and extraordinary photons , although other spectral distributions can be easily accommodated .",
    "different degrees of polarization of the primary spectrum can be then obtained adding together , in different proportions , ordinary and extraordinary blackbody photons . since the non - isotropic opacity of the stellar crust might convey radiation in a preferred direction , we introduce a beaming parameter @xmath103 such that the specific intensity at the star surface takes the form    @xmath104    where @xmath82 is the cosine of the angle between the initial photon direction and the magnetic field . for @xmath105",
    "the radiation is emitted isotropically in the outward hemisphere .",
    "the code is structured into four main blocks , as outlined below . in the first thermal photons",
    "are emitted from the stellar surface , in the second the program evaluates the optical depth of the photon as it propagates through the magnetosphere , while the third is finalized to solve the kinematics of the electron - photon scattering . finally , escaping photons",
    "are stored .",
    "each block is briefly described in the following .      because of the intrinsic asymmetry of the model , the observed spectrum depends on both the shape , and the ( longitudinal ) position of the emitting region on the star surface , and the viewing direction . moreover , as mentioned above , the star surface temperature distribution may not be isotropic . to account for these effects , the star surface is divided into @xmath106 zones by means of an equally spaced @xmath107 and @xmath108 mesh , where @xmath109 and @xmath108 are the magnetic colatitude and longitude .",
    "this choice guarantees that all patches have the same area , so that the number of emitted photons depends only on the patch temperature ( i.e. patches at the same temperature emit the same number of photons ) .",
    "a different temperature may be attached to each surface patch in such a way to reproduce ( up to the accuracy allowed by the finite mesh resolution ) any kind of thermal surface map .",
    "initially we fix the coordinates of an emitting patch and assign a value for the polarization state @xmath110 of each seed photon , i.e. @xmath111 for the ordinary mode or @xmath112 for the extraordinary mode .",
    "all photons are emitted at the patch centre @xmath113 .",
    "then , a photon is extracted at random from the distribution ( [ seedinten ] ) .",
    "we assume that the initial photon angles are such that the azimuth ( as referred to @xmath21 in @xmath113 ) is uniformly distributed while @xmath114 is obtained solving the equation @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is an uniform deviate and @xmath117 is the beaming parameter introduced in eq .",
    "( [ seedinten ] ) .",
    "the coordinates of the emission point and the initial momentum univocally determine the ray along which the photon moves .    actually , after experiencing scattering(s )",
    ", some photons will reach the star surface again .",
    "their number is fairly limited , since scattering typically occurs at a distance @xmath118 of a few stellar radii .",
    "the star disc , as seen from the last scattering point , subtends a solid angle @xmath119 , and this is also an upper limit to the fraction of photons which are scattered back onto the star surface .",
    "numerical simulations show that the actual value is quite smaller , @xmath120 .",
    "we assume that all photons impinging on the surface are absorbed ( regardless of their polarization state ) .      in a monte carlo scheme",
    "the distance @xmath121 a photon of polarization state @xmath110 travels between two successive interactions ( i.e. emission - scattering or scattering - scattering ) is estimated by integrating the scattering depth @xmath122 given by equations ( [ tautot_ord ] ) and ( [ tautot_extr ] ) until @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an uniform deviate .",
    "direct numerical evaluation of the integral ( [ integ_tau ] ) proved , however , quite time consuming , and we found more efficient and faster to perform a stepwise integration the differential equations ( [ tautot_ord ] ) and ( [ tautot_extr ] ) using a fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "integration is terminated as soon as the value of the optical depth exceeds @xmath125 and a linear interpolation between the last two steps is used to determine with better accuracy the value of @xmath121 where @xmath126 .    at each integration step",
    "we check if the photon still lies in the region of the @xmath127 plane where resonant scattering is allowed , i.e. if @xmath128 ( see  [ photons ] ) . when the previous inequality is found to hold no more",
    ", we further check if the photon trajectory is bound to bring it back into the scattering permitted region or not .",
    "this is achieved by computing numerically the tangent to the photon path [ in the @xmath129 plane ] where @xmath130 and checking if it lies in between the two limiting values @xmath131 .",
    "if not , the photon is taken to freely escape to infinity [ see also figure 1 of fernandez & thompson ( 2007 ) ] .",
    "the values of the energy and direction of the photon are then stored , the program returns to step 1 , and a new seed photon is emitted .",
    "assuming that equality @xmath132 is verified at some distance @xmath121 from the point of the previous photon interaction , the kinematics of the scattering must be solved in order to obtain the new direction and energy of the photon .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the velocity @xmath99 of the resonant electron and the new photon polarization state .",
    "this is obtained by generating two new random numbers , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and comparing them with the ratios of the corresponding cross sections . for a photon initially in the ordinary polarization state ( @xmath111 ) , mode switching upon scattering occurs if @xmath135 , while for an initially extraordinary photon ( @xmath112 ) this happens if @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , the decision about onto which of the two resonant electrons ( assuming that both values of @xmath99 are acceptable ) scattering actually occurs is reached by comparing @xmath134 with the ratio @xmath137 $ ] , where @xmath138 stands for each addendum in the sum at left hand side of equation ( [ tautot_ord ] ) ( [ [ tautot_extr ] ] ) . if @xmath139 $ ]",

    "all parameters entering the differential cross section of the process are known .    upon scattering with a moving charge ,",
    "the momentum and energy of the photon are modified . since the cross section ( [ partcross ] )",
    "are defined in the erf , the evaluation of the scattering angles @xmath71 and @xmath75 requires a lorentz transformation from the stellar frame to the frame comoving with the resonant electron @xmath99 . for linearly polarized incoming light",

    ", we note that in the non relativistic case all quantities ( [ partcross ] ) are proportional either to @xmath142 or to @xmath143 .",
    "then , after drawing a new uniform deviate @xmath144 , the scattering angle is given by @xmath145 or @xmath146 , depending on the case .",
    "the corresponding angles in the stellar frame and , hence the new photon direction , are obtained by means of lorentz transformations . in this frame the photon frequency is given by @xmath147 finally , once energy and momentum of the scattered photon are known the computation proceeds starting again from point 3.2 , integrating equations ( [ tautot_ord ] ) or ( [ tautot_extr ] ) along the new photon path .      escaping photons",

    "we introduce an angular grid @xmath148 which divides the `` sky at infinity '' in a fixed number of patches , similarly to what has been done for the stellar surface .",

    "further manipulations ( e.g. to account for viewing angles , or to derive the pulse shape , see below ) are performed at the post - processing level by means of idl scripts , at negligible computational cost . in the following subsections",
    "we discuss the general properties of our spectral models .      in order to explore the role of the different parameters we computed a set of spectra , by evolving @xmath150 photons for @xmath151 surface patches ( i.e. each model has @xmath152 photons ) .",
    "we assume that the star surface is at constant temperature , and that the seed radiation is isotropic ( @xmath153 , see   [ seed ] ) and completely polarized , either in the ordinary or extraordinary mode .",
    "furthermore , we treat the case of an aligned rotator , i.e. the spin and magnetic axes coincide .",
    "photons are collected onto a @xmath154 angular grid on the sky , and in @xmath155 energy bins in the range 0.1100  kev .",
    "the magnetic field has been fixed at @xmath156  g and the surface temperature at @xmath157  kev .",
    "the mean and the maximum number of scatterings per photon are in the ranges @xmath1582 and @xmath1220 , respectively , depending on the parameter values and on the location of the emitting patch on the star surface .    in fig .",

    "the most salient characteristic is the absence of symmetry between the north and the south hemispheres : as @xmath160 increases , spectra become more and more comptonized .",
    "this reflects our choice for the electron velocity distribution , which accounts for the charges bulk velocity , and currents flow from the north to the south pole along the field lines ( of course the opposite choice for the current direction would simply result in @xmath161 ) .",
    "we found that the spectral shape is almost insensitive to the seed photons polarization state ( see fig .",
    "this means that observations of the phase averaged spectrum are not expected to provide useful insights into the polarization degree of the surface emission ( but see  [ res_pol ] ) .",
    "[ f2 ] , [ f3 ] , [ f4 ] illustrate the effects on the spectral shape of varying @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively ( here and in the following we put @xmath165 to simplify the notation ) .",
    "spectra have been averaged over @xmath159 , and plotted for two values of @xmath160 , one for each hemisphere ( left and right panels ) .",
    "as it can be seen , an increase in each of these parameters ( either @xmath162 , @xmath163 or @xmath164 ) always corresponds to an increase in the comptonization degree of the spectrum .",
    "the effect is particularly notable in the case of @xmath162 . if @xmath166 an observer located in the southern hemisphere ( i.e. with currents flowing towards him ) sees a spectrum which is no more peaked at @xmath167 , but peaks instead at about the thermal energy of the scattering particles",
    "this is because comptonization starts to saturate and photons fills the wien peak of the bose - einstein distribution . for intermediate values of the parameters",
    ", spectra can be double humped , with a downturn between the two humps ( a clear example of this behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bigobbo ] ) .",
    "we note that some of the model spectra presented by fernandez & thompson ( 2007 ) also exhibit a downward break in the tens of kev range .",
    "in particular , when assuming a ( non - thermal ) top - hat or a broadband velocity distribution for the magnetospheric charges , they found that multiple peaks can appear in the spectrum .",
    "the difference is that our model predicts at most two peaks , and that the energy of the second one gives a direct information on the energy of the magnetospheric particles .",
    "as noticed by @xcite and @xcite , double peaked spectra may play a role in the interpretation of the broadband x - ray spectrum of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "in particular , the detection of a spectral break at about a few tens of kev may have remarkable physical implications and provide important diagnostics for the physical parameters of the model .",
    "a spectral break at @xmath168  kev , as the one possibly detected in the case of sgr 1806 - 20 , would translate then in a temperature of @xmath169 kev for the magnetospheric electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency of the resonant scattering also increases by increasing @xmath163 ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) , although this effect is less pronounced than that observed while increasing the current bulk velocity .",
    "this is expected , because a change in @xmath52 corresponds to a change in the average thermal velocity for the magnetospheric particles , and not to a boost that equally affects each single particle .",
    "similarly goes for @xmath164 , which effect is less pronounced than that of the bulk velocity ( see fig .",
    "again , we find that no significant spectral change occurs exchanging the polarization of the seed photons from ordinary to extraordinary .",
    "although it would be inappropriate to define the rcs spectra as a `` blackbody plus power - law '' ( the double - humped spectra shown in fig .  [ bigobbo ] are definitely far away from such a definition ) , in many cases the general shape of the continuum is that of a thermal bump and a high - energy tail . in this sense model spectra are reminiscent of the empirical blackbody plus power - law model often used to fit ( rather successfully ) the magnetars soft x - ray emission . since , when present , the high - energy tail is indeed power - law - like , it is of interest to investigate how the spectral index @xmath170 ( as derived by fitting the high - energy tail with a power - law ) changes with the parameters . in particular ,",
    "a hardening of the spectrum is expected for increasing twist angle ( tlk ) and this was invoked as a possible mechanism to explain the correlated flux - hardening variations in some sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the model shown here has @xmath175 kev , @xmath176 , a uniform surface temperature @xmath177 kev and spectra have been obtained summing over all the sky patches .    to illustrate the effects of a non - homogeneous surface temperature distribution",
    ", we discuss the case in which photons are emitted by a single patch .",
    "the subdivision of the star surface and of the sky is the same as that adopted before , and also the energy range and bin width . in the present run",
    "the seed radiation is taken to be isotropic ( @xmath153 ) and unpolarized , i.e. an equal number of ordinary or extraordinary photons are emitted , and , again , the spin and magnetic axes coincide .",
    "we selected an emitting patch located just above the equator ( centred at @xmath178 ) with a surface temperature of @xmath157 kev .",
    "the magnetospheric parameters are @xmath179 , @xmath180 kev and @xmath181 .",
    "figure [ onepatch ] shows the emerging spectrum , as viewed by an observer whose los makes an angle @xmath182 with the spin axis ( i.e. the star is seen equator - on ) for different values of the observing longitude , @xmath183 .",
    "these three values correspond to having the emitting patch in full view ( seen nearly face on ) , partially in view and screened by the star .",
    "the effects of the different viewing angle on the spectrum are dramatic .",
    "when the emitting patch is in full view both the primary , soft photons and those which undergo repeated resonant scattering reach the observer and the spectrum is qualitatively similar to those presented earlier on , with a thermal component and an extended power - law - like tail . on the other hand ,",
    "if the emitting region is not directly visible , no contribution from the primary blackbody photons is present . the spectrum , which is made up only by those photons which after scattering propagate `` backwards '' , is depressed and has a much more distinct non - thermal shape .",
    "radiation emerging from strongly magnetized neutron stars is expected to be highly polarized , due to the strong dependence of radiation transport on the photon propagation mode .",
    "polarization studies have already started at low energies ( ir ) , and future x- and @xmath0-ray polarimetry with high sensitivity instruments , such as the planned photoelectric polarimeter to be flown on the esa mission _ xeus _ , are expected to extend them over a broader spectral band .",
    "the development of detailed theoretical predictions is therefore fundamental : polarimetry will bring into view a new and unique dimension of the problem , through the knowledge of polarization degree and swing angle .    in our scenario ,",
    "the degree of polarization in the soft x - ray radiation emitted by magnetars results from a combination of several effects .",
    "seed thermal photons , originating from the crust or atmosphere of the star , do posses an intrinsic polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of polarization , which is determined by the competition between plasma and vacuum properties , depends on the energy band , and on the details of the density and temperature gradient in the emitting region .",
    "seed photons then propagate in the magnetosphere , where multiple resonant scatterings further influence the polarization degree . by using our monte carlo simulation",
    ", we are in the position to investigate the latter effect , i.e. to estimate the degree of polarization which is expected to arise because of magnetospheric effects only and to investigate its dependence on the model parameters .    in figs .",
    "[ polla1 ] and [ polla2 ] we show , as a function of various parameters , the degree of polarization of the emerging radiation , defined as @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are , respectively , the number of ordinary and extraordinary photons collected at infinity .",
    "the polarization degree has been averaged over frequency , over the whole emitting surface and over the sky at infinity .",
    "as it can be seen , the efficiency at which completely polarized surface radiation is de - polarized increases by increasing the strength of magnetospheric upscattering , i.e. by increasing one of the three parameters @xmath162 , @xmath163 or @xmath164 .",
    "this effect is stronger for ordinary seed photons , for which the probability of undergoing mode switching in the scattering process is higher ( see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "[ [ totcrosslab ] ] ) and for photons emitted close to the south pole ( see fig .",
    "[ polla3 ] , the latter result reflects our choice for the direction of the current flow , as discussed earlier ) . on the other hand , would the surface radiation be completely unpolarized , we can see that , while passing through the magnetosphere , it can acquire only a relatively small degree of linear polarization : typically 1020% , up to 30% for very extreme values of the current bulk velocity .",
    "this means that , would future observations of x - ray polarization result in measurements larger than 10 - 30% , the excess has to be attributed to an intrinsic property of the surface radiation .",
    "we have also explored how the polarization degree depends on the photon energy and a representative case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fpolfreq ] .",
    "the two panels refer to a run with the same set of model parameters ( @xmath179 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath181 ) but performed assuming that seed photons are completely polarized either in the extraordinary ( left panel ) or ordinary mode ( right panel ) .",
    "the polarization degree has been computed as above , but now different viewing directions are retained ( i.e. only sum over @xmath159 has been performed ) .",
    "emission is again from the entire surface ( at constant @xmath189 ) and the star is an aligned rotator .",
    "as expected , for 100% polarized seed photons the polarization degree decreases with increasing energy , since harder photons undergo more scatterings .",
    "low energy photons tend to keep their original polarization state , although there is a dependence on the viewing angle . not surprisingly , even at low energies , the polarization degree is higher when the los is close to the north pole ( dash - triple dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fpolfreq ] ) and drops for increasing viewing angle .",
    "it is interesting to note that the largest de - polarization ( at low energies ) does not occur close to @xmath190 but when viewing the star southern hemisphere at an intermediate angle because of the low particle density near the poles .",

    "transient axps might be powered in a similar way by the sudden release of energy into a localized area of the star surface , as observations of the taxp xte j1810 - 197 seem to indicate @xcite .",
    "although the twisted dipole model used here has the advantage of simplicity while catching the essential physical features , most probably it gives only an idealized representation of the magnetic field outside a magnetar .",
    "the twist may be confined at high magnetic latitudes ( tlk ) , or , if global , it might involve magnetic configurations more complex than a dipole .",
    "possible evidence for a twist which involves in the first place the field lines closer to the magnetic poles have been discussed by @xcite in connection with the period derivative evolution and its correlation with spectral hardness in sgr 1806 - 20 before and after the giant flare of december 27 2004 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite assumed that scattering is conservative in the electron rest frame .",
    "as discussed in  [ cross - sections ] this choice is quite adequate if spectral modeling is restricted to the soft x - ray range and has been retained in the present work .",
    "however , the x - ray spectra of magnetar candidates are nowadays known to exhibit also a high energy ( @xmath2200 kev ) component , which is completely non - thermal and is responsible for about half of the bolometric flux .",
    "although different scenarios for the origin of the high energy emission from magnetars have been put forward , not necessary involving rcs ( see  [ intro ] ) , an intriguing possibility is that also the hard tail arises because of resonant upscattering in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "given the much higher photon energies ( in the 100 kev range ) this necessary requires the presence of highly relativistic electrons ( pairs ) , and , consequently , any attempt to model rcs under those conditions demands for a fully relativistic , qed treatment of the scattering cross sections .",
    "although we presented here spectra extending up to 100  kev , they must be considered as trustworthy only until @xmath230 , i.e. up to a few tens of kev . above these energies",
    "electron recoil starts to become important and the spectrum is expected to break . the precise localization of the break would come only from a consistent treatment , and is particularly important to explain the comptel upper limits observed in some magnetar sources @xcite . moreover , if hard tails are due to a secondary population of ultra - relativistic electrons confined close to the stellar surface ( as proposed by * ? ? ? * ) , resonant scattering would occur at much higher values of the magnetic field , @xmath231 , which makes the need of a completely qed treatment of the cross section even more necessary .",
    "same holds for computations aimed at assessing the role of ions in shaping the spectra .",
    "as previously discussed see  [ currents ] , positively charged ions are expected to populate the twisted magnetosphere , but whether these particles can effectively shape the x - ray spectra is mainly related to the role of those ions located close to the star surface .",
    "the inclusion of this effect , however , requires the knowledge of the full qed resonant cross section for protons / ions which at present has not been investigated in detail .",
    "future work needs to address this issue , among others .",
    "clearly , in order to to include the relativistic treatment of the scattering process in the electron rest frame , having a tested , reliable monte carlo code which can be easily generalized is of fundamental importance and this has been our second motivation in undertaking this study . in order to extend our computation of resonant electron cyclotron scattering to the relativistic regime , we are already completing a detailed investigation of the qed resonant cross section .",
    "this will be then implemented in our monte carlo code and results will be presented in forthcoming papers ( nobili , turolla & zane in preparation ) .",
