    "inflation @xcite is a very successful paradigm for naturally understanding the puzzling aspects of hot big bang cosmology such as flatness , homogeneity and monople problems . as it causally explains the origin of the super - horizon density perturbations , inflation seeds the large structure of the universe we observe today . more like a paradigm than a theory because of the missing fundamental basis , inflation is well established by the observation of cosmic microwave background .",
    "models based on pure de sitter spacetime predict a scale - invariant and adiabatic power spectrum , which can be characterized by @xmath0 . however , this is not the history of our unverse .",
    "wmap and other astrophysical observations predict nontrivial spectral index and running .",
    "the wmap team has reported the five - year data@xcite and used them to constrain the physics of inflation . for the @xmath1cdm model ,",
    "wmap5 data show that the index of power spectrum satisfies @xmath2 . combining wmap with sdss and snia ,",
    "the result is @xmath3 .",
    "though the red power spectrum is still favored at the level of @xmath4 cl , the result is a little bluer than that of wmap3 . and",
    ", the running of the spectral index is not favored anymore . with wmap5 data",
    "only , the running is @xmath5 . combining with sdss and snia data , the result is @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the spectral index in wmap5 is slightly larger than that in wmap3 and the running is much smaller than that in wmap3 .",
    "theoretically , we can modify the inflation models , but it will increase the implicity from the aspect of a fundamental theory . in the series works of @xcite , running index emerges from non - bunch - davis vacuum and the new physics will imprint on cmb .",
    "however , the serious problem is we still know little about de sitter spacetime , which is noted as the ambiguity of vacuum selection .    in the papers @xcite ,",
    "another method has been presented .",
    "the authors obtained the nontrivial spectral index and its running from the generalized slow - roll inflation with arbitrary sound speed .",
    "however , as a new challenge for most inflation models , we expect the spectral index and its running can provide the opportunity to observe the short distance physics and the first moment scenario of our universe .    as a candidate to probe the quantum gravity in string theory ,",
    "noncommutativity is applied to describe d - brane physics .",
    "considering the string effect and strong string interaction , short distance geometry becomes very different .",
    "in addition , while the usual concept of geometry is completely break down near the singularity geometry , noncommutativity is also a good description .    in the works of @xcite , the authors introduced noncommutativity , which naturally emerges from string theory , to inflation physics .",
    "as the running of spectral index is large , they obtained nice results with wmap3 experiment data .",
    "however , most recent , wmap5 explores a quite small running index .    in this lecture ,",
    "we use another method to calculate the modification .",
    "we directly calculate the modification of power spectrum from the noncommutative potential and dynamical terms while the quantum modes solution still remains classical .",
    "we study the modification of the single field inflation models including slow - roll , dbi and k - inflation .",
    "as our calculation includes all the potential and dynamics terms , the modification is exact .",
    "we find these three modification can be written in one unite form at leading order .",
    "this means that the modification can not be tested by different models .",
    "in addition , the leading order of modified power spectrum is @xmath7 , which means that the modification is small .",
    "our calculation shows that the noncommutative potential and dynamical terms can be realized as the possible origin of the spectral index and its running since it is favored by wmap5 data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we review the inflation formalism with a general lagrangian . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the noncommutative effect on inflation including the modification of potential and dynamic and reconstruct the power spectrum . in section 4",
    ", we study concrete models and compare with the wmap5 observation .",
    "section 5 contains some conclusion and discussion .",
    "in this section , we review the formalism presented in @xcite which can describe different inflation models in a general lagrangian @xmath8 .",

    "it is useful to define the `` speed of sound '' @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "the primordial power spectrum @xmath22 evaluated at the time of horizon exit at @xmath23 and the spectral index @xmath24 can be derived as @xmath25 the motive equation of inflaton is @xmath26 the classical solution is @xmath27 where we choose the standard bunch - davies vacuum as the background to fix the coefficient . in this paper",
    ", we study the modification of the noncommutativity effects on the potential and dynamic terms while the solution of inflaton still remains classical .",
    "noncommutative geometry on small scale is a consequence of string theory . a better description of noncommutativity geometry , in terms of the algebra generated by noncommutative coordinate , is @xmath28=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath29depends on the background flux in string theory .",

    "after serially taylor expand @xmath15 and @xmath46 around the background value and multiply with the according terms in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we obtain the whole change of second order action of perturbation due to noncommutative geometry . in leading order of slow - roll parameter",
    "it can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and we have picked out the terms with least @xmath51 to reduce the order of slow - roll parameter . to simplify the calculation , we need to pick out the terms of leading order of slow - roll parameter .",

    "first , we study the slow - roll inflation model which is the most popular model studied in the literature . the effective action takes the canonical non - relativistic form : @xmath61 the value of speed of sound @xmath62 .",

    "the value of speed of sound is @xmath71 .",
    "the modified parts can be expressed as @xmath72 we find that the modification of dbi inflation is independent of the potential term .",
    "the modified parts of primordial power spectrum is @xmath73.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as presented in the paper of @xcite , the power spectrum of the dbi inflation is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant and flow parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 are also constant .",

    "the lagrangian of the power law k - inflation is of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant .",

    "if we only consider the leading order corrections in terms of the comoving wave number @xmath78 by noncommutative effects , the modified primordial power spectrum can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath76 , and @xmath92 are all parameters .",
    "so , the modification from noncommutativity is model independent at leading order .",
    "the scalar spectral index derived from the wmap5 data is relatively blue comparing to that of wmap3 , though it is still red - tilted .",
    "the running of the spectral index , according to the wmap5 data , explores an upward shift from the three - year result , @xmath93 ( wmap5 + bao + sn ) .",

    "as an important method to detect short distance physics , noncommutativity naturally emerges from string theory and is applied to inflation physics .",
    "branderberger and ho found noncommutativity can modify the power spectrum in a significant way .",
    "in addition , in papers@xcite , it has been used to regulate the eternal inflation .",
    "recent released wmap5 data favor a red - tilted power spectrum of primordial fluctuations at the level of two standard deviations , which is the same as the wmap3 result .",
    "however , qualitatively , the spectral index is slightly greater and the running is quite small than the three - year value .",
    "our calculation is quite different .",
    "first , we calculated the modification from the potential and dynamical terms while the solution of inflaton remains classic .",
    "second , we calculated the modification of slow - roll , dbi and k - inflation .",
    "we found the modification is model independent , as we only considering the leading order .",
    "in addition , as the leading order modification of power spectrum is proportional to @xmath7 , the modification of is quite small and can be favored by wmap5 .",
    "third , as we used the string scale in our paper and the correction is proportional to @xmath94 , it could be larger if we have a relative low noncommutative scale .    finally ,",
    "as wmap five - year data provide stringent limits on deviation from the minimal , 6-parameter @xmath1cdm model , we expect more years wmap and planck data give us more information about the anisotropy of cmb .",
    "in addition , future cmb missions such as ground - based polarization experiment of bicep and esa s planck surveyor , are also expected to help us faithfully understand the early universe .",
