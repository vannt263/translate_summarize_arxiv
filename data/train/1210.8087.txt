    "in the last few years , it has become clear that a large fraction of low mass stars ( @xmath3 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are orbited by super - earth - mass planets on relatively short period orbits , including a handful detected in the liquid water ( habitable ) zones ( e.g. , gj 581d and gj 667cc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "these planets have small but non - negligible probabilities of transiting in front of their host stars . given the favorable star ",
    "planet size ratio , we already have the technical means to begin spectroscopic characterization of their atmospheres .",
    "gj 1214b was the first super - earth found to transit in front of an m dwarf @xcite and , as a consequence , it has received significant observational and theoretical attention in the past three years . while the orbit is too close to the star to support hospitable oceans of liquid water ,",
    "gj 1214b offers the first opportunity to attempt atmospheric characterization of a super - earth @xcite , but apparently contradictory results have emerged from these studies .",
    "different gases in the atmosphere of a planet absorb light more efficiently at certain wavelength ranges . as a result , one should be able to measure a different effective transit depth as a function of wavelength . for example",
    ", @xcite reported excess absorption in the k band , which would be compatible with an extended and mostly transparent atmosphere with a strong absorber in the near infrared . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite could not detect significant features in the optical transit depths .",
    "this result was confirmed by the same group in a more extended wavelength range @xcite and has also been confirmed using hst spectrophotometric observations in the near infrared @xcite .",
    "such a flat transmission spectrum favors a very opaque atmosphere with high concentrations of water vapor as the main source of opacity , indicating that the planet could be mainly composed of water .",
    "all these interpretations rely on atmospheric models that are strongly dependent on the planet s bulk properties , especially its mass , radius , mean density , surface gravity , and stellar irradiation . prior to the detection of the planet candidate , was a largely ignored m dwarf . as a result , some of its fundamental properties had significant uncertainties ( e.g. , its distance ) .",
    "uncertainties in the fundamental parameters of gj 1214 propagate strongly into the planet s bulk properties , adding an extra element of uncertainty in discussions about the possible nature of its atmosphere .",
    "probably the most significant measurement we provide here is the new measurement of its trigonometric parallax at 0.6% precision ( previous parallax measurement had a @xmath0 10% uncertainty , * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , the luminosity and mass of gj 1214 have experienced significant updates as well .",
    "the orbital solution for gj 1214 can also be updated using recently published transit observations and refined doppler measurements obtained with our newly developed software ( harps - terra , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the wise catalog @xcite has also been recently released , adding four more absolute flux measurements of gj 1214 , thus enabling a comprehensive spectral energy distribution adjustment and a more secure determination of t@xmath4 . in section [ sec : observations ] , we present the new capscam astrometric measurements and our re - analysis of public harps doppler measurements . a new keplerian solution for gj 1214b is presented in section [ sec : rvorbit ] . in section [ sec : star ] , we give an overview of the stellar properties in the light of the new distance measurement , its near infrared spectrum , and updated absolute magnitudes .",
    "finally , section [ sec : starplanet ] combines all of the transit observables with the new orbital solution and provides the posterior probability distributions for the updated star  planet parameters .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of gj 1214 has been obtained using the carnegie astrometric planet search camera ( capscam , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) installed in on the 2.5 m dupont telescope of the las campanas observatory ( chile ) .",
    "the observations span 26 months ( june 2009 to sep 2012 ) and 10 epochs have been obtained at an average precision of 1.0 milliarcsec ( mas ) per epoch .",
    "each epoch consists of 20 or more exposures of 45 seconds each .",
    "gj 1214 is significantly brighter than the average background sources and would saturate the detector in less than 10 seconds .",
    "however capscam can read out a small part of the array much faster than the full field @xcite . for gj 1214 , a window of 64@xmath564 pixels",
    "is read out every 5 seconds , and all subrasters are added to the final full field image .",
    "the field of view of capscam is 6.6 arcminutes wide and is typically rich in background stars , so a very robust reference frame with more than 30 objects can be used to correct for field distortions .",
    "centroid extraction , source crossmatching , field distortion correction , and astrometric solutions for all the stars in the field have been obtained using the atpa astrometric software developed within the caps project ( available upon request ) .",
    "the methods and algorithms applied are outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the parallax and proper motion requires fitting 5 astrometric parameters simultaneously : initial offset in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , proper motion in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the parallax itself .",
    "the formal uncertainties from a classic least - squares analysis ( e.g. , from the diagonal of the covariance matrix ) are usually overoptimistic and do not properly account for correlations between parameters . to overcome these issues , we estimate the uncertainties in the astrometric parameters using a monte carlo approach .",
    "this is done by generating many realistic sets of measurements and measuring the standard deviation of the resulting derived parameters for the entire monte carlo - generated sample .    to do this properly ,",
    "a first realistic estimate of the epoch - to - epoch accuracy is needed .",
    "the outputs of the astrometric processing are the astrometric parameters of the target star and of all the other objects in the field . by combining the residuals of all the reference stars from all the epochs",
    ", we can compute the expected uncertainty per epoch . doing this , we obtain an epoch - to - epoch accuracy of @xmath0 1.3 mas on both @xmath6 and @xmath7 . since the reference stars are fainter than the target , this is a conservative estimate of the real precision for the target .",
    "the star itself , which is not included in the reference frame , shows a standard deviation in the residuals of 1.0 mas / epoch , which is also consistent with the expected capscam performance , assuming 20 minutes of on  sky observations per epoch ( see * ? ? ?",
    "then , we simulate 10@xmath8 synthetic sets of astrometric observations ( same format as table [ tab : astrodata ] ) using the nominal parallax and proper motion at the same epochs of observation .",
    "random gaussian noise with a single epoch uncertainty of 1.3 mas is injected into each synthetic data set and the 5 astrometric parameters are derived .",
    "the standard deviation of each parameter over the 10@xmath8 solutions is the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the obtained uncertainty for the differential parallax is 0.44 mas and corresponds to a relative precision of @xmath9 .",
    "we note that this monte carlo method implicitly accounts for parameter correlation ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the differential astrometric measurements used to measure the differential parallax and proper motion of gj 1214 are given in table [ tab : astrodata ] .",
    "the best fit solution over - plotted with the astrometric epochs is shown in figure [ fig : astrometry ] .",
    ".local astrometric measurements of gj 1214 [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     we note that the measured proper motions are also differential and contain an unknown offset due to the unknown average motion of the background stars ( e.g. , all galactic plane stars move roughly in the same direction ) . even though catalog values are less precise than the ones we obtain , catalog proper motions are usually corrected for proper motion zero  point ambiguities .",
    "differential measurements as well as the suggested values for the proper motion of gj 1214 ( lspm - north catalog , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also provided in table [ tab : astroresults ] .",
    "the eso public archive contains 21 reduced harps spectra of gj 1214 obtained by @xcite .",
    "we reanalyzed these public harps spectra using our software called harps - terra ( harps template enhanced radial velocity re - analysis application , * ? ? ?",
    "harps - terra derives differential rv measurement by constructing a high signal - to - noise ratio template from the observations and matching it to each spectrum using a least - squares approach .",
    "gj 1214 is faint at optical wavelengths ( v@xmath014 ) . as a consequence , very long exposures ( 2400 sec )",
    "were required to obtain any signal at all .",
    "still , the typical s / n at 6100   is only @xmath010 so careful construction of the template is a key element in order to achieve the maximum precision .",
    "the standard setup of harps - terra for m dwarfs uses all the echelle apertures redder than the 22nd one ( 4400@xmath10 6800 ) and adjusts a cubic polynomial to correct for the variability of the blaze function across each echelle order .",
    "detailed algorithms and performance of harps - terra on a representative sample of stars is given in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that error bars listed in [ tab : rvdata ] are smaller than those in @xcite , suggesting a more optimal usage of the doppler information in the spectra .",
    "however , reduced error bars do not guarantee a more accurate orbital fit when the rv variability is dominated by systematic noise ( either instrumental or stellar ) . to account for this",
    ", we included an unknown noise term in our monte carlo markov chain runs which had a substantial effect on the derived distributions , especially on the orbital eccentricity ( see discussion in section [ sec : rvorbit ] ) .",

    "therefore , we are interested not only in the favoured orbital solution , but also in obtaining a realistic numerical representation of the posterior density function of the parameters to propagate them into the estimates of the star  planet properties .",
    "these samples are generated using a bayesian monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we use custom - made mcmc software to combine rv with transit observations and to obtain such distributions .",
    "the software is based on the mcmc tools used in @xcite adapted to the doppler plus transit problem , and uses a gibbs sampler .",
    "jump scales of the gibbs sampler are initialized using the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix at the maximum likelihood solution , and they are adjusted in the first 10@xmath8 steps ( the `` burn - in '' period ) to accept between 10% and 30% of the jump proposals for each parameter .",
    "as discussed below , we assume flat priors for all the sampling parameters . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability of accepting a new state is just the ratio of likelihoods at the current and proposed jump position .",
    "an outline of the general mcmc method applied to the keplerian problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "the keplerian model for the radial velocities is the same as in @xcite and the transit observations are predicted using the recipes given in the nasa exoplanet archive webpage .",
    "transit observations strongly constrain the orbital period , but also put strong restrictions on the sum of the initial mean anomaly @xmath13 , the argument of the node @xmath14 ( also called , mean longitude @xmath15 ) , and the product @xmath16 ( eccentricity and argument of the node ) .",
    "accordingly , we use @xmath17 as a free parameter .",
    "since the transit instants explicitly depend on @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are sometimes used as the mcmc sampling parameters .",
    "we also tested this approach , and , while it has some desirable properties ( e.g. , symmetry around zero eccentricity) this parameterization imposes an _ _ implicit prior _ _ and @xmath21 are cartesian coordinates derived from the polar radial coordinate @xmath22 and the angle @xmath14 . because mcmcs are based on the integration of a probability distribution , to preserve the flat prior choices for @xmath22 and @xmath14 , one would need to include the jacobian of the transformation ( @xmath23 ) as a prior when using @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the markov chain sampling parameters .",
    "the use of such a prior is undesirable due to numerical stability issues ( divergence for @xmath26 ) . ]",
    "that severely biases the estimates of @xmath22 to artificially larger values ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar discussions ) .",
    "therefore , at the sampling level , we choose those free parameters that , from our point of view , should have flat prior distributions .",
    "these are : orbital frequency @xmath27 , rv semi - amplitude @xmath28 , mean longitude @xmath17 , argument of the node @xmath14 , and eccentricity @xmath22 . despite @xmath14 being poorly defined and uncertain at low eccentricities , the convergence of the mcmc was substantially improved thanks to the use of @xmath17 instead of @xmath13 , so we find this parametrization convenient and sufficient for our purposes .",
    "all the approximate parameter values are already known from previous studies and , therefore , we initialize the mcmcs within 3 standard deviations of the orbital solution proposed by @xcite .    real uncertainties in radial velocity measurements are difficult to estimate properly , especially when the star is active . to account for that , we model the uncertainty of the @xmath29-th measurement as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the formal uncertainties derived from harps - terra ( third column in table [ tab : rvdata ] ) , and @xmath32 is a _",
    "_ that accounts for the extra systematic noise . in this context ,",
    "the jitter parameter @xmath32 is treated as any other free parameter .",
    "we assign a constant uncertainty to each transit instant of 400 sec .",
    "this uncertainty is 10 times larger than the typical reported formal errors but it is more consistent with the different instants of transit measurements obtained simultaneously by different groups ( see table [ tab : transittimes ] ) .",
    "while the mcmc convergence properties are greatly improved , 400 sec is a small fraction of the time - baseline covered by the transits and , as a consequence , the period is still strongly constrained .",
    "the transit time measurements have been extracted from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .        in table",
    "[ tab : rvsolution ] , we provide the expected values for the most relevant combination of parameters for physical and transit prediction computations as derived from the combination of 10 mcmc runs with @xmath33 steps each .",
    "figure [ fig : rvfit ] is an illustration of the maximum _ a posteriori _ probability ( map ) solution and is given only for illustration purposes .",
    "since the amplitude of the signal is small compared to the noise , the eccentricity is still poorly constrained .",
    "the posterior distribution of the eccentricity has a maximum very close to @xmath34 and monotonically decreases with @xmath22 ( see figure [ fig : edist ] ) implying that close to circular orbits are favored .",
    "because of their significance for the transit observables ( e.g. , see section [ sec : starplanet ] ) , an illustration of the mcmc samples of the derived parameters @xmath20 and @xmath35 is also provided in figure [ fig : edist ] .",
    "previous estimates of the eccentricity of gj 1214b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) seemed to favor eccentricities close to 0.1 , but still compatible with 0 . in initial tests",
    ", we recovered this same slightly higher eccentricity value if the noise parameter @xmath32 was fixed to @xmath34 .",
    "this indicates that previous estimates of the orbital elements were biased due to a non - consistent treatment of the rv uncertainties . even though stellar jitter dominates the error budget ( @xmath36 2.9 m s@xmath12 ) , the rms of the map solution using the new harps - terra measurements is lower ( 3.4 m s@xmath12 ) than the one reported by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the origin of the slightly smaller amplitude is likely caused by stellar activity . by analyzing doppler measurements on known active m dwarfs ( e.g. , ad leo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found that the classic harps - ccf approach always produces a larger doppler amplitude than the one derived using harps - terra ( between 1.1 to 1.5 times larger ) if a candidate signal is caused by activity .",
    "the likely explanation for this is the different sensitivities of the two methods to the changes in the stellar line - profiles .",
    "while one could use this effect to obtain a further diagnostic to check the reality of low - mass candidate planets ( under investigation ) , in this case it means that the most likely source of systematic noise comes from the star rather than from the instrument .",
