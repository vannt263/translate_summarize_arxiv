    "intermediate mass stars are an interesting middle scenario : are they numerous enough and powerful enough to trigger further star formation , or suppress it ?",
    "one way to determine their effect on their environment is to analyze the physical conditions of the surrounding material before and after it is impacted by shocks tied to the jet / outflow .",
    "shocks were categorized by their physics in @xcite : j - type shocks in which the magnetic field from the shocked ions is either frozen into the shock , or is non - existent ; j - type shocks with magnetic precursors ( or radiative precursors ) , in which the neutral fluid undergoes a discontinuous `` jump '' in density and temperature ; and c - type shocks in which the fluid changes continuously over the shock boundary .",
    "the conditions in these shocks vary and can be constrained through observations of fine structure line emission with differing appearance potential and critical density . at 700 pc distant ,",

    "natural laboratories for shock models  housed within the cep ob3 association .",
    "cep a contains a collection of luminous protostellar sources ; additionally these protostars are associated with at least two broadly extended co outflows , cep a east and cep a west @xcite ; the latter sometimes referred to as ggd 37 @xcite or hh 168 @xcite .",
    "both flows have been mapped by spitzer - irs @xcite .",
    "the extinction toward ggd 37 is generally thought to be small @xcite but @xcite apply an a@xmath4 of 16 to their data .",
    "high - resolution near - ir imaging @xcite of the molecular emission from ggd 37 reveals a chain of bow shocks in ggd37 .",
    "the se - nw orientation of most of these shocks suggest an outflow driven from the vicinity of hw3c ( a 10 @xmath5 protostar in cep a east ) , while other bow shocks suggest a flow orientation that is more east - west .",
    "additionally a chain of several extremely high proper motion ( @xmath6 800 km s@xmath0 ) knots of [ fe ii ] 1.644 @xmath7 m emission connects the se - nw flow but is notably absent in the e - w flow .",
    "the [ fe ii ] emission peaks around a trio of radio sources , centered at `` w2 '' @xcite ( see figure [ apertures ] ) .",
    "the cep a region has been mapped in both hard and soft x - rays with xmm - newton @xcite and chandra @xcite . both hw2 and",
    "hw3c are detected in hard x - rays , while ggd 37 ( including the w1-w2-w3 region ) is detected in soft x - rays .",
    "@xcite note several distinct soft x - ray sources within the ggd 37 flow , one near the w2 region , and one at the far end of the flow .",
    "they conclude for ggd 37 that l@xmath8 erg s@xmath0 , and infer a shock velocity of 620 km s@xmath0 , and a temperature of 4 @xmath9 10@xmath10 k from comparisons to l1551-irs 5 / hh 154 @xcite .",
    "they observe that the flow is extreme in temperature , although not in luminosity .",
    "the x - ray emissions are offset from both the optical and radio emissions , and they conclude this is due to the complex morphology of the region and multiple driving sources , as well as anisotropy in the medium .",
    "in this paper we present spitzer - irs maps of highly ionized mid - ir forbidden lines in ggd 37 and show that the offset and extended nature of these _ spitzer _ lines , and the x - ray emission , are directly attributable to the cloud shock .",
    "we utilized the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) onboard _ spitzer _ to observe ggd 37 as part of our guaranteed and general observing time ( program 2 , pi : j.r .",
    "houck ; program 30167 , pi : d. a. neufeld ) ; for the full dataset , see green et al .",
    "( 2010a , in prep . ) .",
    "we observed this region in a spitzer - irs map grid consisting of two adjacent rectangles , on two separate occasions ; first in short - high ( sh ; spectral resolution r @xmath6 600 ) and long - high ( lh ; r @xmath6 600 ) in 2004 , and again in short - low ( sl ; r @xmath6 60 - 120 ) and in deeper exposures in long - high in 2007 .",
    "these maps cover approximately the same regions of the sky , although cep a east was observed concurrently with the first set of observations of ggd 37 .",
    "the resolution of individual pixels of the irs is given in the spitzer observers manual as ranging from @xmath6 2 - 5 arcsec squares , depending upon the module in question ; therefore the maps contain differing spatial resolution , although they have all been regridded and oversampled for display purposes .    for full details of the data reduction process , see green et al .",
    "( 2010a ) ; here we briefly summarize the procedure .",
    "the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) were processed at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) using version s12.0 , s15.3 , or s17.2 of the processing pipeline , and then reduced using smart @xcite , modified by additional routines that we have developed to deal with map grids ( as opposed to single observation staring mode ) .",
    "we process the data beyond the traditional smart reduction by removing bad pixels in all modules , using a  grand \" rogue mask created from a superposition of the bad pixel masks of each separate observing campaign .",
    "rogues that occur once at the 4@xmath11 level are considered to be permanently bad pixels and thus the grand rogue mask contains 25% more rogue pixels than a single campaign rogue mask .",
    "bad pixels are fixed using a nearest neighbor routine ( imclean.pro and imnan.pro ) .",
    "next we extracted individual spectra not simply from each slit position , but from each individual resolution element of each slit position . in the case of sh and lh",
    ", we produce five ( semi-)independent spectra , spatially separated by the resolution of a single pixel in the array ; in sl we use 32 independent positions to generate spectra .",
    "the spectra are then re - gridded onto a regular grid in right ascension and declination .",
    "pixels with ( nearly ) identical positions are averaged together .",
    "we apply the slit loss correction function ( j. d. smith , private communication ) to correct for flux - calibration created for point - sources , used by the ssc .",
    "the result is a downward correction to the flux to @xmath6 60 - 90% of the original value .",
    "we report the first detection of [ ar iii ] , [ ne iii ] , [ o iv ] or [ ne v ] in a herbig - haro flow .",
    "the [ o iv ] ( 25.89 @xmath7 m ) detection is fit separately both spectrally and spatially from the much brighter nearby [ fe ii ] line ( 25.99 @xmath7 m ) .",
    "@xcite observed emission from apparent spectral lines several resolution elements on both sides of extremely bright lines in their sources , but they were ascribed to data artifacts due to the symmetric nature of the  lines \" around the central peak . in this case",
    "the [ fe ii ] line brightness is not extreme and there is no corresponding bump on the long - wavelength side of the [ fe ii ] 26 @xmath7 m line .",
    "the [ ar iii ] map is co - spatial with the other lines , with the exception that it appears to contribute to the westernmost clump in the map , unlike the other species of higher appearance potential .",
    "additionally there is a possible detection of [ ar iii ] ( 8.99 @xmath7 m ) but it is suspect due to lack of coherence in its mapped spatial structure ( green et al . 2010b , in prep . ) .",

    "originally detected as a radio emitter by @xcite and resolved into three separate components ( w1 , w2 , and w3 ) by @xcite using vla data , w2 is a prime candidate for an intermediate mass protostellar object driving an exceptionally powerful outflow @xcite .",
    "the edge of the ggd 37 flow is approximately located at source s as defined in @xcite , and the w2 and s locations coincide with a line of soft x - ray emission @xcite , as well as velocity - resolved [ o iii ] ( 5007  ) emission in the case of source s @xcite . @xcite",

    "it is therefore not very surprising that such highly ionized species as o@xmath15 and ne@xmath16 are present ; these ions trace the hottest gas and provide constraints on the shock energetics .",

    "our data reveal spectral lines with extremely high excitation potentials , ranging up to 97 ev in the case of [ ne v ] .",
    "the ratio of [ ne ii]/[fe ii ] ( 26 @xmath7 m ) which peaks in the vicinity of w2 , is 10 - 20  much larger than is seen in other intermediate mass yso regions ( e.g. hh 54 or hh 7 - 11 * ? ? ?",
    "the [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] ratio is @xmath6 0.2 - 0.5 in this region , gradually falling off to the west before peaking slightly again at the edge of the flow , although it should be noted that this may be confused by separate excitation mechanisms .",

    "ne@xmath20 has only weak charge transfer , and ne@xmath19 none at all , with h @xcite .",
    "this is of importance in analyzing [ ne ii ] in protoplanetary disks . in the present case the [ ne iii ] and [ ne ii ] emission regions are so similar in shape",
    ", they are likely to be excited the same way , in an extended and unusually powerful protostellar outflow .",
    "the spectra closely resemble that of a supernova remnant , although there are several differences : the lack of certain lines such as [ p ii ] 32.5 @xmath7 m and [ ne iii ] at 36 @xmath7 m @xcite , although the latter is probably too faint to be detected in this case .",
    "additionally , [ o iv ] and [ ne v ] are not observed in hii regions",
    ".    published models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hm89 ) do nt seem to account for the observed line ratios , however .",
    "the first problem comes in measuring the mechanical luminosity of the flow from cooling rates .",
    "[ o i ] 63 @xmath7 m is modeled as the principal cooling line , and [ fe ii ] and [ si ii ] are both expected to trace [ o i ] .",
    "predicted intensity ratios of [ fe ii]/[o i ] and [ si ii]/[o i ] are @xmath6 0.1 for most values of electron density ( n@xmath21 ) and shock speed ( v@xmath22 ) , as these lines are also optically thin .",
    "[ o i ] intensity is proportional to the total mass flow through the shock boundary ; using the `` w123 '' aperture we calculated an expected intensity of @xmath6 2 @xmath9 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath0 @xmath24 sr@xmath0 , and the resulting mass flow rate is 10@xmath25 n@xmath26 v@xmath22 for density n@xmath26 . assuming a fast shock velocity of 100 km s@xmath0 , and n@xmath26 @xmath6 2 @xmath9 10@xmath27 @xmath28 , the mass flow rate is 3.3 @xmath9 10@xmath29 @xmath3 . if instead we perform the same calculation with [ si ii ] ( 34.8 @xmath7 m ) , the mass flow is 5.4 @xmath9 10@xmath30 @xmath3 , nearly 10 times higher .",
    "this is due to the ratio of [ si ii]/[fe ii ] flux @xmath12 1 over the entire flow , which does not match any conditions in hm89 .",
    "although the [ si ii ] and [ fe ii ] emission are morphologically quite similar , this may reflect differing critical densities , or a high si / fe abundance compared to solar values .",
    "however this is more likely because hm89 do not include sufficiently fast outflows .",
    "additionally hm89 do not predict fluxes of high - excitation species such as [ ne v ] and [ o iv ] .",
    "the mappings iii shock model library @xcite predicts mid - ir flux ratios , as already noted for the case of [ ar iii ] .",

    "the relative lack of [ o iv ] compared to [ ne ii ] and [ fe ii ] predicts a large shock velocity of 500 km / s or more , without a precursor .",
    "the lack of [ s iv ] and relatively high [ ne iii ] flux seem to indicate a slower 200 km s@xmath0 shock , but still without a precursor .",
    "mappings iii is far too low in density ( and therefore in recombination rates ) , and does not fit the observed line ratios .",
    "modeling the molecular emission and the forbidden lines simultaneously is difficult .",
    "@xcite model ggd 37 itself with a 25 km s@xmath0 j - shock with a magnetic precursor , which matches",
    "the h@xmath13 emission well but is not nearly fast enough to produce the high - excitation lines . in advance of detailed complex modeling",
    "we can make cruder estimates of shock energetics implied by the mid - ir and x - ray emission .",
    "we can estimate the shock speed from detailed balance from excitation by uv / x - ray emission , as a function of the ratio of [ ne v]/[o iv ] .",
    "the highest temperature achieved in the shock is given by the [ ne v ] 97 ev transition , indicating a temperature of 4 @xmath9 10@xmath10 k. we can calculate the shock speed from the observed temperature and luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a solar abundance ratio of o / ne @xmath6 8 , we derive a post - shock temperature of 18,100 k for the observed [ o iv]/[ne v ] ratio of @xmath6 10 .",
    "this indicates a post - shock velocity of only 24 km / s .",
    "furthermore , @xcite posit that the entire flow is one continuous flow of shock - heated material with a velocity in the hundreds of km s@xmath0 .",
    "the approximate emitting volume is @xmath6 4 @xmath9 10@xmath31 @xmath32 , and the derived n@xmath21 of emitting plasma is @xmath6 10 @xmath28 in that region .",
    "thus we find a total shocked mass 0.62 @xmath5 for a density of 2 @xmath9 10@xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the total momentum of the flow is then 124 @xmath5 km s@xmath0 , assuming a fast shock speed of at least 200 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this is quite high compared to other powerful flows observed with spitzer - irs ( e.g. 1 - 2 @xmath5 km s@xmath0 for hh 7 - 11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further evidence that ggd 37 is unusual .",
    "if we propose a single emitting region containing all three observed ionization states of ne ( ne@xmath19 , ne@xmath20 , ne@xmath16 ) , supposing the hot postshock gas is uniform in n@xmath21 and temperature t , and the ionization states are in equilibrium , we could in theory estimate the physical conditions .",
    "however under these assumptions it is impossible for a single region to produce all three lines simultaneously .",
    "thus comparable intensities of all three transitions suggests either a photoionizing source or a collisionally ionizing source  in either case , likely a powerful and extremely hot jet , highlighted by the x - ray emission region ( figure [ xray_ir ] ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the h@xmath13 emission , as well as the [ fe ii ] and other fine structure line maps will be explored in subsequent papers .",
    "we present the detection of [ ar iii ] , [ o iv ] , and [ ne v ] fine structure lines , the highest appearance potential for optical or infrared lines ever detected in the vicinity of a herbig - haro flow . considering this data along with 0.2 - 1.0 kev x - ray maps of the flow",
    ", we suggest that ggd 37 is the hottest hh object detected so far .",
    "the extended nature of the high ionization energy lines and soft x - ray emission from the ggd 37 flow suggests that it is extraordinarily energetic for a herbig - haro object , perhaps an indirect detection of a radiative jet . in agreement with models of planar c+j shocks ,",
    "we detect a significantly extended transitional boundary layer .",
    "this suggests that the radio source w2 is a plausible candidate for a high mass embedded protostar driving an outflow to the northwest .",
