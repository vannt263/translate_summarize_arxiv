    "compact groups of galaxies provide a rich environment in which to study the effect of galaxy interactions and mergers on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "compact groups are among the densest concentrations of galaxies known , comparable to the centers of rich clusters @xcite .",
    "however , they also have relatively low velocity dispersions , increasing the duration of gravitational interactions between the galaxies in these groups @xcite .",
    "in fact , a large fraction of galaxies within hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) have morphological peculiarities of some kind @xcite or abnormal rotation curves @xcite .",
    "because of their galaxy densities and velocity dispersions , compact groups may provide local analogs to hierarchical galaxy formation in the earlier universe .",
    "moreover , these groups provide laboratories to study a variety of physical processes , including the formation of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , super star clusters , and dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is currently unclear how the frequent tidal encounters that occur in compact groups induce or inhibit activity and transformation of the member galaxies .",
    "studies of elliptical galaxies in hcgs indicate that interactions have modified their isophotes and/or that some ellipticals in these groups are bluer than normal @xcite .",
    "surveys of subsets of hcgs have yielded apparently contradictory results relating the role of interactions and star formation .",
    "for example , based on a sample of 95 galaxies within 31 hcgs , h@xmath1 emission seems to be anti - correlated with the velocity dispersion of hcgs @xcite , suggesting that higher levels of star formation activity are associated with slower interactions between group members .",
    "however , based on a sample of 30 galaxies in 20 hcgs , @xcite do not find any significant correlation between the dynamical properties of a group and the presence of disturbed morphology or nuclear activity of group members .",
    "the compact group environment may lead to exhaustion or stripping of molecular gas , or perhaps concentration of molecular gas into the nuclei of the member galaxies .",
    "individual galaxies in hcgs as a class may be relatively deficient in both atomic and molecular gas compared to isolated spirals @xcite , although @xcite find the molecular gas content in hcgs to be similar to that in pairs and starburst samples .",
    "leon et al . (",
    "1998 ) also find enhanced h@xmath2 for the most compact groups , which suggests that the galaxy interactions drive the gas inwards .",
    "groups that are more deficient in hi also have a higher detection rate in x - ray observations @xcite , possibly indicating that ionization via shocks , heating , or the intergalactic radiation field contributes to the lack of neutral gas observed in these systems .",
    "an example of strong large - scale shocks due to encounters between galaxies and the igm is seen in stephan s quintet ( hcg92 ) @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies in hcgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supporting the idea that significant amounts of matter may be stripped from member galaxies during their interactions .",
    "based on hi observations of 72 hcgs , verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) propose an evolutionary scenario that is somewhat analogous to the famous `` toomre sequence '' for merging galaxy pairs .",
    "first a loose group gradually contracts into a compact group @xcite .",
    "this stage is followed by a `` transformation '' period in which galaxy morphologies tend to evolve to earlier types , during which hi gas is extracted and dispersed , and x - ray gas is created . throughout this scenario , the gas is actively redistributed from the relatively quiescent interstellar medium ( ism ) , to fuel star formation , power agn activity , and contribute to the intercluster medium ( icm )  giving rise to a variety of observable processes .    many of the processes that could be taking place within compact groups will have a signature in the infrared emission of the galaxies  agn activity , star formation , and the presence of warm / cold dust should all be readily observable in the thermal infrared . based on iras observations , @xcite and @xcite find that compact group galaxies exhibit a normal level of infrared emission compared to control samples of isolated galaxies , which suggests that the tidal activity in these groups does not generally enhance star formation .",
    "thermal infrared observations with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) were carried out on hcg  31 and hcg  92 @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that several modes of star formation related to the compact group environment are simultaneously present in these groups ( including intense star formation at collision interfaces , star formation in the tidal debris , and star formation due to galaxy interactions with the icm ) , which demonstrates that in at least some hcgs the interaction of group members has affected star formation .",
    "these observations also potentially provide insight into the nature of gas deficiency in hcgs ; the far - ir 60@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m observations of hcg  92 indicate diffuse emission from dust outside of the galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , plausibly powered by stripped or tidally formed stars .",
    "these case studies have been valuable for gaining insight into specific groups . however , compact groups present very complex environments , and studies of individual groups can not probe the range of processes and environments that may contribute to an `` evolutionary sequence '' . as part of a multi - wavelength effort to study compact groups , and the variety of physical processes that take place within them , we have obtained _ spitzer space telescope",
    "_ observations of a sample of twelve nearby ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ) compact groups chosen to span a range in evolutionary properties .",
    "in addition to the _ spitzer _ data , we also present the 2mass ( the two micron all sky survey , * ? ? ? * ) fluxes of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the goal of this initial paper is to present an overview of the main infrared properties of the sample .",

    "photometry was then performed with a specialized idl routine developed by a. reines and r. indebetouw ( see description of code in reines et al . in prep ) that detects a specified contour level in a reference image , assigns a background annulus that has the same shape as the aperture contour ( but is expanded out by a specified factor ) , and then carries out the photometry using identical apertures and annuli at each wavelength for a given galaxy .",
    "for the photometry in this paper , apertures were determined by combining all four irac bands ( weighted by @xmath12 ) , and determining a contour level of 1.5 - 2@xmath9 .",
    "a background annulus was used that had inner and outer scales 2@xmath13 and 2.5@xmath13 the scale of the aperture .",

    "@xmath18  mjy ( which are only    marginally detected ) .",
    "the uncertainties for faint objects are largely driven by surface brightness issues , where small variations in the local background can dramatically affect the measured flux densities .",
    "compact groups are complex environments with heterogeneous properties and present a challenge to any kind of morphological or evolutionary classification ; placing compact groups into evolutionary stages is more complex than for the two - galaxy interactions found in the analogous toomre sequence .",
    "as evidence of the difficulties in classifying hcgs , verdes - montenegro et al . note the lack of one - to - one correspondence between the presence of tidal features and the atomic gas content of hickson compact groups .",

    "@xcite proposed an evolutionary sequence based on the content and distribution of hi gas for hickson compact groups : pre - interaction , shocked intergroup medium , and smooth intergroup medium . in this scenario , the evolutionary stage of a group",
    "is postulated to be associated with the hi deficiency of the group members and the group as a whole .",
    "hi deficiency is defined as @xmath20 - { \\rm log}[m({\\rm      hi)_{obs}}]$ ] , where",
    "the `` predicted '' hi mass of a galaxy is determined from the typical hi mass of a field galaxy of similar hubble type and luminosity @xcite .",
    "we wish to classify hickson compact groups in a quantifiable way while also mitigating the effects of possible morphological misclassification of galaxies in determining a group s evolutionary state . here",
    "we adopt a variation of the verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "method for classification of the hickson compact groups ; as a proxy for evolutionary state , we use @xmath21 . using dynamical masses calculated from velocity dispersions and median galaxy separations in @xcite , @xcite , and/or @xcite and hi masses from @xcite ( with the exception of hcg  90 , for which the hi mass was provided by j. hibbard , private communication ) , each group was placed in one of three categories : ( i ) relatively hi - rich , @xmath22 ,",
    "( ii ) intermediate hi , @xmath23 , and ( iii ) relatively hi poor , @xmath24 .",

    "the histogram resulting from the total sample of galaxies in the twelve hcgs studied in this program shows a clear bimodal structure , with peaks in the relative number of galaxies around hubble type  0 and hubble types  6 - 8 .",
    "given that only twelve groups are included in this sample , this histogram is remarkably consistent with the distribution of morphological types found in all hcgs @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that this distribution is distinctly different from general samples of galaxies such as the third reference catalog ( rc3 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a uni - modal distribution that peaks around type sbc galaxies .    in figure  [ types",
    "] it is clear that early hubble types tend to be found in groups of type  iii , while late hubble types are preferentially found in groups of type  i. galaxies in type  ii groups are relatively evenly distributed among hubble types .",
    "these trends suggest that the degree to which a group is relatively gas rich or gas poor may simply reflect the hubble types of a group s constituent galaxies .",
    "however , the physical scenario may be more subtle than this , especially given that hcgs as a class appear to be gas deficient , and the causal relationship between a group s galaxy content and gas properties is not straight forward .",
    "we note that of the type  i and type  ii groups in this sample , only one of them was detected in the x - ray survey of @xcite ( hcg  16 , which is known to contain active galaxies ) , while all four of the type  iii groups were detected ( hcg  42 , hcg  48 , hcg  62 , and hcg  90 ) .",
    "the relative contribution to a group s total x - ray flux from the individual galaxies from the igm is important to distinguish in this context .",
    "for example , hcg  42 and hcg  62 have bright emission from the igm , while the x - ray emission hcg  90 is dominated by the contribution from individual galaxies .",
    "hcg  16 also has evidence for a faint igm in addition to the contribution from agn activity @xcite .",
    "in fact , while all of the type  iii groups have x - ray detections , none of the galaxies in type  iii groups have strong infrared emission as seen in their seds shown in figures  [ hcg2sed]-[hcg90sed ] .",
    "this result is consistent with what is seen in brightest cluster galaxies in clusters without strong cooling flows by @xcite .",
    "those clusters frequently have evidence for agn activity that apparently injects energy into the intracluster medium and prevents cooling ; the large x - ray bubbles in hcg 62 indicate similar activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of type",
    "iii groups in this sample , they could be observed as `` gas deficient '' in hi simply because their intra - group gas has largely been heated and ionized .",
    "there have been several interesting suggestions that a hot cluster icm plays an important role in the truncation of star formation activity in clusters ( e.g. , poggianti et al .",
    "2004 , moran et al .",

    "the infrared colors of the galaxies in this sample are shown in figures  [ plotirac1]-[plotjhk2 ] .",
    "the near- to mid - ir colors of a source will largely be dependent on the temperature of the dust , the relative strength of the underlying stellar blackbody emission , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , which can contribute significantly to three of the four irac bands @xcite .",
    "the near - ir 2mass observations at the j , h , and k - bands will largely be dominated by stellar blackbody emission with a possible contribution from very hot dust near the sublimation temperature ( @xmath25  k ) . of the four irac bands , the only band that is not subject to a possible strong contribution by pah emission is the 4.5@xmath0 m band .",
    "the strongest pah contribution is expected in the 8.0@xmath0 m band .",
    "emission in the 24@xmath0 m band is dominated by thermal emission from dust .",
    "these three dominant components of emission in the infrared can , to some extent , be disentangled by examining the spectral energy distributions of galaxies .",
    "a source with emission dominated by hot dust will result in a k - band `` excess '' , and a rising continuum from 3.6@xmath0 m to 24@xmath0 m .",
    "a source with strong pah emission will exhibit a falling spectral energy distribution from 3.6@xmath0 m to 4.5@xmath0 m and a rising spectral energy distribution from 4.5@xmath0 m to 8.0@xmath0 m .",
    "a source that is dominated by stellar light will have a spectral energy distribution that falls continuously from the near - ir to 24@xmath0 m with the rayleigh - jeans tail of the stellar blackbody emission .",
    "figure  [ plotirac1 ] shows the irac colors of the galaxies , which we have separated into four quadrants that are divided by lines delineating whether the spectral energy distribution of a source is rising or falling with increasing wavelength for a given flux density ratio .",
    "galaxies with emission dominated by stellar light with little dust or pah emission are expected to be located in the lower left quadrant . for reference",

    "galaxies with active star formation and/or agn activity are largely expected to be located on the top portion of this plot ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; contributions to their seds from pah emission or hot dust will result in stronger emission at 8@xmath0 m than at 4.5@xmath0 m . in order to differentiate the galaxies that fall in the top or bottom of this plot ( reflecting the ratio of flux densities in the 8.0@xmath0 m and 4.5@xmath0 m bands ) in figures  [ plotmix1 ] and [ plotjhk1 ] , we consistently use @xmath13 and @xmath19 symbols , respectively , to represent them . for comparison , we plot the galaxies from the kiss survey of star - forming galaxies as diamonds @xcite , and the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ) as dots @xcite .",
    "the color selection criteria for agn defined by @xcite are indicated by a shaded area ; while a significant fraction of the galaxies in the kiss sample are in this region of color space , only a handful of the galaxies in this sample fall in that area , including hcg  7a , hcg  7d , hcg  22c , hcg  31 g , hcg  59a , and hcg  90a . however , the integrated colors of galaxies can obscure low - level agn activity , and several of the galaxies in this sample are consistent with hosting agn based on their nuclear colors ( gallagher et al .",

    "the galaxies that fall in the lower left quadrant ( e.g. dominated by stellar emission ) are tightly clustered near the stellar ellipse . by contrast , the galaxies that fall in the upper right quadrant exhibit a significant spread in their colors , which is consistent with variable contributions from hot dust and pah emission , plausibly reflecting different levels of star formation and/or agn activity in the galaxies .",
    "as expected , the kiss sample is almost exclusively located in the upper portion of this plot .",
    "a major difference between the irac colors of galaxies in this sample in and the fls sample of @xcite is the lack of a vertical plume in our data ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ plotirac1 ] ) .",
    "lacy et al .",
    "attribute the galaxies in this plume to occupy this area of color space because they are at redshifts where the 6.2@xmath0 m pah feature has shifted out of the 5.8@xmath0 m band and into the 8.0@xmath0 m band .",
    "the galaxies in the sample of hcgs presented here do not have redshifts sufficient to cause this effect ( by definition , the sample was selected to have velocities @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ) .",

    ". this could be due to generally elevated star formation and/or dust content .",
    "however , another very plausible explanation is simply that the bulk of the 8@xmath0 m pah feature has red - shifted out of the 8@xmath0 m band for a significant fraction of the galaxies in the fls , which would only require a moderate redshift of @xmath28",

    "type  i groups are relatively the most gas - rich by mass , and type  iii groups are relatively the most gas - poor by mass . in figures  [ plotirac2]-[plotjhk2 ] these types",
    "are respectively shown as stars , triangles , and squares .",
    "it is important to note that these types are based on the properties of the _ group _ , whereas the data points are _ individual galaxies _ within a group of a given type . in other words",
    ", we are attempting to probe whether the local properties of a member galaxy are related to the global properties of the group in which it resides .",
    "the infrared colors of the constituent galaxies appear to be related to the type of group in which they reside , and figure  [ plotirac2 ] reveals a few striking trends .",
    "first , the hi gas - deficient group galaxies ( type  iii ) are relatively tightly clustered near the nexus of stellar colors , which is expected if there is little star formation , reddening , or agn activity .",
    "the only outliers are known agn galaxies in hcg  90 ( galaxies a and d ) .",
    "the galaxies in more gas - rich groups span a much larger range in colors , with type  i groups extending toward much redder colors , indicating higher levels of star formation and agn activity overall .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that the galaxies in this sample appear to follow a sequence in the infrared color - color space , with a relative gap in the galaxy population found at moderate colors ( @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "this `` sequence '' and `` gap '' are more significant in comparison to the fls galaxies and sings galaxies , which do not appear to exhibit such a gap .",
    "we note that this gap is reminiscent of the so - called `` green - valley '' that is apparent in color - magnitude diagrams of galaxy samples such as that presented by @xcite .",
    "this gap may also reflect the bimodal structure of the distribution of hubble types seen in fig .",
    "[ types ] .",
    "if this gap in the hcg galaxies distribution is dynamical in nature , it suggests that star formation and agn activity in hcg galaxies responds to the dynamical processes taking place on rapid timescales .",

    "[ plotirac2 ] are seen in figure  [ plotmix2 ] , with the median color of galaxies in type  i , type  ii , and type  iii groups slightly offset .",
    "the near - ir colors alone , as shown in figure  [ plotjhk2 ] , do not reveal any strong trends with group type . however , it is interesting to note that the outlying sources are either from groups of type  i or type  ii , or known agn galaxies ( hcg  90a and hcg  90d ) .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m luminosity of the member galaxies also exhibits a slight trend with group type , as shown in figure  [ lum_hist ] .",
    "galaxies in gas - rich groups of type  i have the highest average 24@xmath0 m luminosity , while galaxies in gas - poor groups of type  iii have the lowest average 24@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "this trend is in accord with type  i groups hosting the most actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite examined 24@xmath0 m emission of the arp interactive and field spiral samples of galaxies , but see little statistical evidence for a difference between those two populations .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent with the trends seen here , as our sample of compact groups contains many early type galaxies , which the @xcite sample was not designed to investigate .",
    "we present new _ spitzer _ observations of a sample of twelve hickson compact groups comprising 45 galaxies and combine these with existing 2mass survey observations .",
    "the goal of this project is to examine the relationship between the compact group environments and various physical processes .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized below .",
    "the amount of pah emission , reddening , and 24@xmath0 m emission in each galaxy appear to be related ; these observables tend to be similarly strong or weak for a given galaxy , reflecting the amount of recent star formation activity .",
    "galaxies that strongly exhibit these features , also have much greater scatter in their colors , plausibly reflecting variable contributions to the integrated light from agn and starburst activity ; galaxies dominated by stellar light with little evidence for recent starburst and/or agn activity have a much smaller range of infrared colors .",
    "the near - infrared ( j , h , k ) colors of the member galaxies are largely consistent with being dominated by slightly reddened normal stellar populations .",
    "we separate the compact groups into three types based on the ratio of their dynamical and hi masses , with type  i being the most gas - rich and type  iii being the most gas - poor .",
    "an analysis of morphological types indicates that late - type galaxies are preferentially found in type  i groups , and early - type galaxies are preferentially found in type  iii groups .",
    "however , the causal relationship that underlies these trends is not clear .",
    "the near - ir colors do not show any strong trends with group type , although the outlying points with a k - band excess tend to be galaxies in type  i and type  ii groups .",
    "galaxies in type  i groups tend to be the most actively star forming as manifest in their thermal - ir colors , with type  ii also showing a moderate level of activity , and type  iii groups are relatively quiescent .",
    "this result could be interpreted as type  i groups actively consuming their gas ( and forming stars ) , while type  ii groups may be generally somewhat further along in this process .",
    "galaxies in type  iii groups tend to be relatively tightly clustered around the locus of colors for normal stellar populations , with the few outliers known to be active galaxies .",
    "the sensitivity of thermal infrared colors to neutral gas content suggests that the gas _ content _ of a hickson compact group is at least as important as the neutral gas _ distribution _ in promoting or inhibiting star formation .",
    "clearly both gas content and gas distribution are important to a group s evolutionary state , although it is not yet clear how independent or related these parameters are .    the group type also appears to be reflected in the 24@xmath0 m luminosity of the member galaxies .",
    "galaxies in groups of type  i have the highest average 24@xmath0 m luminosity , while galaxies in groups of type  iii have the lowest average 24@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "this trend is in accord with the most gas - rich groups hosting the most actively star - forming galaxies . of the type  i and type  ii groups in this sample , only one of them has an x - ray detection ( hcg  16 , which is known to contain active galaxies as well as faint x - ray emission from the igm * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while all four of the gas - poor groups have been detected in the x - ray ( hcg  42 , hcg  48 , hcg  62 , and hcg  90 * ?",
    "these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the missing hi gas in the most `` deficient '' groups may have been converted to x - ray emitting hot gas .",
    "there are striking trends seen in this study between the @xmath36 ratio for an entire hickson compact group and the infrared colors of the individual member galaxies , which suggest that the constituent galaxies in hickson compact groups are related to the type of group in which they reside .",
    "however it is not clear from these observations whether the `` gas - richness '' of a group simply reflects its fraction of late - type galaxies , or whether the gas - richness of a group affects the constituent galaxy types .",
    "clearly the morphology of the gas within a group must have a role , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the galaxy sample here has characteristics that are distinctly different from the sample of galaxies in the _ spitzer _ first look survey .",
    "most notably , hickson compact group galaxies exhibit a `` gap '' in infrared color space that is sparsely populated .",
    "this gap may suggest a rapid evolution of galaxy properties in response to dynamical effects in hcgs .",
