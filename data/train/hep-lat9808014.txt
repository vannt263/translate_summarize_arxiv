    "string breaking has importance in lattice calculations because it reveals directly the effect of dynamical quarks",
    ". however the energy crossover effect characteristic of string breaking has proved difficult to observe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently progress has been made and string breaking has been observed as a mixing phenomenon directly in @xmath1 higgs models in three and four dimensions @xcite . the phenomenon is currently under investigation in the much more demanding case of qcd @xcite .",
    "a crude model of the process based on strong coupling ideas has been proposed which pictures it as a mixing process between a string state and a two - meson state @xcite .",
    "it shows that because of its dependence on a mixing angle the wilson loop may not reveal the string breaking energy crossover unless the mixing region is sufficiently broad and that in any case it is not by itself a satisfactory observable for revealing the crossover .",
    "this is consistent with numerical simulations @xcite which show the need for a suite of operators with members appropriate to both the string and two - meson states .    in this paper",
    "we develop the crude strong coupling model to discuss a number of simple mixing scenarios and use it to discuss the relationship between quenched and unquenched calculations .",
    "we take the opportunity to improve the model by including energy factors associated with the emission of light quarks from bound states .",
    "these factors are required in order to achieve results independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "they were missed in the original presentation @xcite but are essential parameters @xcite .",
    "we elaborate the model on the one hand by including several quark flavours and on the other by including diagrams that represent meson exchange .",
    "finally we apply our approach to more complex situations that are specific to @xmath0 and examine the case of string breaking in the presence of a static quark - diquark system .",
    "the model we use was explained previously @xcite . it is based on simple planar lattice diagrams with internal dynamical quark loops .",
    "the initial formulation of the model is in terms of the rules for a `` strong coupling expansion '' @xcite , modified to accommodate the presence of bound states in a simple way .",
    "the rules are ( slightly modified from those of ref @xcite as indicated in ref @xcite ) :    a factor of @xmath2 for each plaquette , where @xmath3 is the ( dimensionless ) string tension .    a factor of @xmath4 for each wilson quark line in the direction of the unit vector @xmath5 , interior to the diagram .",
    "here @xmath6 is the standard quark hopping parameter .",
    "a factor of @xmath7 for each wilson quark line propagating in the direction of the unit vector @xmath5 along a static anti - quark line .",
    "this creates the model for the static - light bound state meson .    a factor of @xmath8 for each emission of a light quark from a meson state .",
    "here @xmath9 is a ( dimensionless ) energy parameter that determines the rate of emission of light quarks from the meson .",
    "such a parameter is essential in order that the results of the model are independent of the lattice spacing .    a factor of @xmath10 ( in the case of @xmath0 ) for each internal quark loop .",
    "a trace over the spin matrix factors for each internal quark loop .    in the above the hopping parameter , @xmath6 , reflects the light quark mass , @xmath11 , and the bound state hopping parameter , @xmath12 , determines the energy of the static meson , @xmath13  .",
    "( in ref @xcite @xmath14 was the energy of a two - meson state and therefore had twice the value assigned here . )",
    "if we apply the above rules to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ figure : f1 ] we obtain for the string - string transition amplitude the result _",
    "ss=(e^-r)^t_1 we^-m_qr(e^-2e_m)^t_2 we^-m_qr(e^-r)^t_3  .",
    "the string breaking scenario considered previously involved a static quark and anti - quark separated by a ( dimensionless ) distance @xmath15 . in the notation of previous papers @xcite",
    ", we have a = e^-r  ,  b = e^-2e_m  ,  c = we^-m_qr  .",
    "the basic string state has an energy @xmath16 and the two - meson state an energy @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in ref @xcite the propagating eigenstates have energies @xmath18 where _ = \\{a+b }  .",
    "to pick out the lattice spacing independent part we can treat all the dimensionless parameters as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we then treat @xmath15 and any time interval , @xmath21 , involved as @xmath22 and expand to the lowest significant order in @xmath20 .",
    "we then find e_=\\{r+2e_m }  .",
    "having carried out this operation we can treat the above formula as referring to dimensionfull quantities . note that it is essential to have the energy parameter @xmath9 as a factor in the quantity @xmath23 in order that this result holds true @xcite .",
    "similar remarks apply to other quantities in the model .",
    "the mixing angle is =  . carrying out the expansion in small quantities we find =  .",
    "the formulae in ref @xcite for the mixing range @xmath24 and the energy split at maximal mixing , @xmath25 are correct when the energy parameter @xmath9 is included .",
    "as indicated in ref @xcite , the results are r = e^-m_qr  ,   e = we^-m_qr  .",
    "the relation r= [ drde ] is preserved .",
    "all these formulae may now be regarded as being explressed in physical parameters .",
    "the transition energy parameter is set by @xmath25 .",
    "eq ( [ drde ] ) is then a prediction for the mixing range in terms of the maximal energy split .",
    "an important reason for measuring string breaking is to identify the effect of dynamical fermions directly .",
    "it is therefore useful to consider the comparison between relevant quantities in the quenched and unquenched situations .",
    "a natural amplitude to measure is the transition amplitude between the string and the two - meson state @xcite .",
    "the unquenched case was considered previously @xcite .",
    "the result was an amplitude of the form _",
    "ms(t)=(_+^(t-1)-_-^(t-1 ) )  , where @xmath21 is the full interval in the time direction associated with the measurement .",
    "the significance of this form is that the amplitude is suppressed outside the mixing region where the factor @xmath26 vanishes .",
    "if we reexpress the formula in terms of physical parameters then we find _",
    "ms(t)=()(e^-e_+t - e^-e_-t )  .",
    "the corresponding quenched approximation can be described in our model as a sum over graphs of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : f2 ] . the resulting amplitude expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath23 is ^(q)_ms(t)=_t_1=1^t-1b^t_2ca^t_1  , where @xmath29  .the result is ^(q)_ms(t)=cab  . when translated into physical parameters we find ^(q)_ms(t ) = ( ) ( e^-2e_mt - e^-rt )  .",
    "the quenched and unquenched results are very similar in the region @xmath30  . in the complementary region ,",
    "the inner part of the mixing region on our definition , they exhibit very different behaviour .",
    "the unquenched amplitude exhibits the continuous crossover while the quenched amplitude shows an abrupt change from one exponential behaviour to the other at the crossover point",
    ". it would be extremely interesting if this contrast in behaviour could be verified in a real simulation .",
    "although our model rather oversimplifies the relationship of the quenched and unquenched calculations it is still possible that a measurement of the above transition amplitude in a quenched simulation would yield an estimate of the energy @xmath9 that could stand as a prediction for the unquenched calculation .",
    "so far the model has been formulated only for a single flavour of light quark .",
    "the presence of several flavours of quark is accounted for by summing over the @xmath31 flavour insertions of quark loop .",
    "this means that the model has @xmath32 channels , namely the string channel and the @xmath31 two - meson channels associated with the different flavours of quark .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath33  .",
    "following the same analysis as in the single flavour case and assuming that the light quarks are degenerate we easily see that the summation of relevant graphs is achieved by considering a @xmath34 correlation matrix @xmath35 that obeys the update equation g(t+1)=ag(t )  , where a=(a&ac&ac + bc&b&0 + bc&0&b )  , and we can assume that @xmath36  .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the two - meson state that is anti - symmetric under the interchange of flavours propagates with the factor @xmath37  . it does not mix with the string state .",
    "the symmetric state does mix with the string .",
    "if we choose the symmetric and antisymmetric states as basis states then the matrix @xmath38 assumes the form",
    "a=(a&ac&0 + bc&b&0 + 0&0&b )  , the problem therefore remains a two - channel mixing problem of the same form as before with the minor change that @xmath39  .",
    "there is no need to carry the explicit calculation further since the results are obvious .",
    "the general case of @xmath31 flavours follows the same lines . only the completely flavour symmetric combination of two - meson states mixes with the string . the mixing being of a strength @xmath40 times greater than the single flavour case .",
    "the remaining @xmath41 two - meson channels orthogonal to the symmetric one remain unmixed .",
    "if the light quarks are not flavour degenerate then to a first approximation the two - meson state corresponding to the lightest quark will show the first and strongest mixing with the string state since it lies at the lowest energy .",
    "heavier quarks will mix at larger distances with decreasing strength",
    ". it would be interesting to test this obvious and plausible scenario in a full qcd calculation .",
    "it was implicit in the summation technique used previously that diagrams of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : f3 ] were not included @xcite . to include them",
    "requires a new rule for the vertex associated with the emission of the light quark pair .",
    "it is    a factor @xmath42 for the pair emission vertex , where @xmath43 is a dimensionless energy parameter . again",
    "this factor is necessary in order to eliminate explicit dependence of the results on the lattice spacing .",
    "if , after emission , such a light quark - anti - quark pair were to propagate along a link , the corresponding factor according to the rules would be ( ) ( ) ( 2)^2 naively the hopping parameter factor @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 . in the context of the model",
    "it would not be unreasonable to identify the quark pair exchange as a meson exchange .",
    "if the meson has a mass @xmath46 then we should replace @xmath44 with @xmath47  .",
    "this is the interpretation we will adopt .    for completeness",

    "this is consistent with the idea that the extra light meson exchange represented by @xmath62 corresponds to a potential interaction between the two static mesons of the form @xmath63 that displaces the centre of the mixing region in the appropriate way .",
    "if we estimate the mixing region as @xmath64 then we find r=  .",
    "this is essentially the same result as derived previously @xcite but now including the effect of the potential between the mesons .",
    "as before the energy split at the point of maximum mixing is @xmath65 , that is e = we^-m_qr  .",
    "we have therefore the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the form r=  .",
    "these results may now be interpreted as referring to quantities in physical units . in deriving them",
    "we have dropped corrections that vanish with the lattice spacing .",

    "although the energies are likelier to be higher than in the standard string scenario the static quark - diquark string is also of great interest as an alternative string system specific to @xmath0 and because of what it can reveal about diquark dynamics .",
    "we have explored further the consequences of a simple picture of string breaking as a mixing phenomenon . we have clarified the elimination of lattice spacing dependence in the model by improving it over its original formulation with the introduction of appropriate energy factors for quark and meson emission from bound states .",

    "it is also interesting that only the totally symmetric combination of two - meson channels participates in string breaking leaving the orthogonal combinations unmixed .",
    "we point out that a comparison of the quenched and unquenched calculations of string breaking is of considerable interest as a simulation .",
    "the appropriate measurement is of the string - meson transition amplitude . on the basis of the model",
    "we show that the two cases are likely to be rather similar in the outer part of the mixing region but show distinct behaviours in the central part of the mixing region , where the quenched amplitude shows a sharp transition between energy exponentials and the unquenched case shows a more gradual crossover .",
    "it is possible , if the comparison between the two cases is made in an appropriate way in an actual simulation , that the quenched measurement could provide a prediction for the energy split and the size of the mixing region in the unquenched case .",
    "we study static quark - diquark string breaking which shows some simple but interesting patterns of channel mixing .",
    "the basic phenomenon is very similar to that of the quark - anti - quark string breaking .",
    "the symmetry of the system however provides us with two channels in the quenched case .",
    "these each go on to mix with appropriately symmetrical or antisymmetrical meson - nucleon channels .",
    "this pattern of double string breaking is interesting in itself and more so since it is specific to the case of @xmath0  .",
    "it seems worth investigating this case even though the higher energies involved will make it harder to measure .",
    "perhaps an approach using a non - symmetric lattice with a fine lattice spacing the time direction would be appropriate in this case .",
    "the success of simulations using the @xmath1 higgs model in observing string breaking @xcite suggests that similar results could be obtained for the scenarios discussed in this paper with scalar matter fields replacing the dynamical quarks .",
    "it would of course be necessary to go to the @xmath0 higgs model to see the effects discussed in the previous section .",
