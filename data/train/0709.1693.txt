    "it is now well established that a subset of neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binary systems are millisecond pulsars powered by accretion from either a brown dwarf or degenerate companion in a very close binary configuration .",

    "it was discovered by the _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) as part of the hard x - ray transient monitor program . in   [ data ]",
    "we discuss the observations made with _",
    "swift _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) . in   [ timing ] and",

    "swift j1756.9@xmath02508 was discovered using the _ swift _ bat hard x - ray transient monitor @xcite .",

    "j1756 was detected in the daily full - sky mosaics that are produced in the transient monitor .",
    "it first rose to detectability ( fig .",
    "[ pca_lc ] ) on 2007 june 7 ( mjd 54258 ) with an average rate in _ swift _ bat of @xmath3 , corresponding to approximately 37 mcrab . the discovery was announced on june 13 @xcite .",
    "the bat data for all pointings when the source was fully coded ( visible to all bat detectors ) were processed using the _ swift _ analysis tools , which included cleaning out the diffuse background and flux from other bright sources in the field of view .",
    "the discovery of j1756 triggered a target of opportunity ( too ) observation in the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) beginning at 15:25:32 ut , 2007 june 13 .",
    "it was intermittently observed over 13 days for a total exposure of 60 ks .",
    "the xrt data were processed with standard procedures ( xrtpipeline v0.10.6 within ftools in the heasoft package v.6.1.2 ) , filtering , screening , and grade selection criteria ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photon counting ( pc ) data collected during the first three segments were corrected for pile - up and for the presence of single - reflection rings due to the nearby bright source gx  5@xmath01 . for the windowed timing data we extracted source events in a square region with a side of 20 pixels",
    "ancillary response files were generated with xrtmkarf and account for different extraction regions , vignetting and point - spread function ( psf ) corrections .",
    "the light curve ( fig .",

    "( rxte ) , starting at 18:42:00 ut , 2007 june 13 . because gx 5@xmath01 is within the @xmath4 field of view of the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) collimator , the pca pointing direction was offset by about @xmath5 , primarily eastward of the true pulsar position .",
    "the pca light curve ( fig .",
    "[ pca_lc ] ) has been corrected to effective on - axis values using the collimator response function , and spectral response functions account for the offset as well . the offset pointing direction is within @xmath6 of the galactic ridge , and so contamination from diffuse emission is present .",
    "the amount of contamination was found by examining other nearby pca observations , when j1756 was quiescent , and fitting with a simple phenomenological model ( and assuming it is constant ) .",
    "the contaminating flux was about @xmath73 mcrab .",

    "the fact that even the 2007 outburst was not seen strongly in the asm , it is possible that an earlier outburst was missed .",
    "thus we set a tentative recurrence time scale of @xmath12  yr .",
    "the discovery announcement led to several multiwavelength observations of j1756 .",
    "a possible fading near - ir counterpart was announced with @xmath13 = 19.7 on mjd 54270 and @xmath13 = 21.0 on mjd 54282 @xcite .",
    "however an observation with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope during the x - ray outburst ( 1.4 ghz ; mjd 54266.103 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed no sign of coherent radio pulsations .",
    "furthermore , j1756 was not detected in observations after the outburst in either 8.7 ghz radio ( mjd 54277.371 , * ? ? ? * ) or 0.38.0 kev x ray ( chandra upper limit of @xmath14 , starting mjd 54287.059 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations .",
    "fig .  [ pca_lc ] shows that the outburst of j1756 had a very rapid rise ( @xmath15  d ) .",
    "after this the bat flux was nearly constant for the next several days .",
    "for the first several days of xrt and pca observations ( up to mjd @xmath16 ) , the flux in both instruments showed a slow decline , which can be fit to a nearly exponential decay , @xmath17 , where @xmath18  7.3 @xmath19 0.4 d. this matches fairly closely the decay in the bat light curve .",
    "after this date the flux in all three instruments began a steeper decline ( @xmath18  0.6 @xmath19 0.3 d ) and was undetectable even in the pca after mjd 54271 , a mere 13 days after the start of the outburst .",
    "this light curve is similar in form to those of three other x - ray millisecond pulsars : sax j1808.4@xmath03658 @xcite and igr j00291 + 5934 @xcite , and in particular xte j1751@xmath0305 @xcite , which showed very similar values of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the three other objects have had more than one outburst , on recurrence time scales of @xmath21  yr , and all outbursts of xte j1751@xmath0305 and igr j00291 + 5934 and most outbursts of sax j1808.4@xmath03658 have been short ( @xmath22  days ) , although notably the 2000 @xcite and 2002 @xcite outbursts of sax j1808.4@xmath03658 were longer and more erratic . given the non - detection of earlier outbursts , j1756 is alone among the fast - decaying millisecond pulsar systems in not showing recurrence .",
    "we searched for high frequency variability by constructing an fft - based power spectrum from the pca data .",
    "the spectrum showed a significant , narrow excess near 182 hz @xcite , which was also found in following observations .",
    "the feature was several mhz wide , which suggested an x - ray pulsar with orbital doppler broadening .",
    "examination of power spectra on short ( @xmath7300 s ) intervals confirmed a sinusoidal orbital modulation , making swift j1756.9@xmath02508 the eighth known accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar , and the one with the longest rotation period .",
    "we performed precision timing analysis on the pca data using the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "x - ray event data were recorded in the ` e_125us_64m_0_1s ` mode , and event times were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the position determined from xrt imaging ( see table  [ tab - orbit ] ) . the @xmath23 statistic ( or rayleigh statistic )",
    "was computed , and the orbital / timing parameters were adjusted to produce the largest @xmath23 power of the pulse fundamental .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to radio or x - ray pulse time - of - arrival fitting @xcite , but with no binning . after adjustment",
    ", we found no long term or orbital systematic trends .",
    "the binary orbit model was the ` ell1 ` from tempo software version 11.010 , which is designed for nearly circular orbits .",
    "the orbital parameters are shown in table  [ tab - orbit ] , and confirm that this is a very compact and circular orbit .",
    "the pulsation frequencies from mjd 54264.78 to 54267.07 , folded on a trial orbital period clearly establish the orbital frequency modulation .",
    "the pulsed semi - amplitude is a nearly constant @xmath76% throughout the observations .",
    "no pulsed signal was seen in the 1550 kev band from 250  s of bat event starting starting at mjd 54266.065 , with a @xmath24  limit of @xmath25 % . with the present data we can place only weak upper limits on the pulse frequency derivative ( @xmath26 ) , since the time baseline is quite short .",
    "the data from both the pca and xrt ( which cover 100% of the orbit ) were searched for modulation at the orbital period .",
    "the pca light curve ( 210 kev ) shows no modulation at the orbital period , after the long term trend is subtracted .",
    "the @xmath24  upper limit to orbital modulations is @xmath27  % from the pca data .",
    "there is also no significant modulation seen in the xrt data .",
    "furthermore there are no signs of eclipses , dips or bursts .",
    "we searched for rapid variability by constructing power spectra of 64  s segments of event data , with a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz , and averaged contiguous power spectra . while some variability is present , especially below @xmath28200 hz , a detailed timing study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we do not find any features above 200 hz which are obvious kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "for the summed outburst , the 95% upper limits on the fractional r.m.s .",
    "are about 6% ( 9% ) for 16 hz ( 128 hz ) wide qpos , and a factor of @xmath282 larger for a single observation .",
    "we fit the swift / xrt spectrum from each segment in the 0.59kev energy range with different models , which included a single absorbed power law ( pl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an absorbed black body ( bb ) .",
    "a simple comparison of null hypothesis probabilities clearly favours the pl with respect to the bb model ( 20% vs.  4% , respectively ) , with the black body fit producing systematic residuals both at low and high energies .",
    "the derived absorbing column density is always in excess of the galactic value ( @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xcite ) and there is no indication of a softening of the spectrum with time .",
    "representative spectral fits are shown in table  [ tab - spect ] .",
    "the source was detected in the pca up to energies @xmath31  kev , and the spectrum is consistent with an absorbed power law with absorption fixed at the best - fit value of xrt segment 003 .",
    "the bat data from 14 to 195  kev were fit by a simple power law model . the bat spectrum is softer than the spectra found from fits to the pca alone or xrt alone , suggestive of a cut - off to the power law .",
    "however joint fits to the bat , xrt and pca spectra are not improved with a cut - off power law model .",
    "given the uncertainty in the spectrum at high energies , we estimate the integrated outburst fluence to be @xmath32 ( 110000 kev ) . using the angular proximity of the source to the galactic center to estimate the distance , we can , following @xcite , estimate the time - averaged mass accretion rate , @xmath33 , where @xmath34  is the distance is units of 8 kpc , @xmath35 ) , and we assume a neutron star radius of 10 km .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is the recurrence time in units 10 yr , and only @xmath37  is allowed by the observations .",
    "in combination , the measured mass function and binary orbital period @xmath38 constrain the donor s mass - radius ( @xmath39-@xmath40 ) relation , assuming the donor fills its roche lobe . for swift j1756.9@xmath02508 , @xmath41  minutes , a value near the median of the known x - ray millisecond pulsars .",
    "if we assume a particular value for @xmath42 , we can calculate possible values of @xmath43  from the mass function , @xmath44 , where @xmath45  is the binary inclination to our line of sight and @xmath42  and @xmath43  are the masses of the pulsar and companion , respectively .",
    "the lack of eclipses allows us to set a limit @xmath46 @xcite . for this inclination and @xmath47",
    ", we have @xmath48 . assuming a uniform distribution of possible values of @xmath49  we can set a 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) upper limit on the mass of @xmath50 ( for @xmath47 ) .",
    "the range of possible values of @xmath43  up to this limit and corresponding companion radius @xmath51  are shown in fig .",
    "[ rvm_plot ] . if we consider a larger neutron star of @xmath52 , the limits ( 95% c.l . ) are @xmath53  and @xmath54 .",
    "this radius is less than the minimum radius for low - mass hydrogen rich brown dwarfs of any age ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) , as expected for a binary period of @xmath55  min @xcite .",
    "thus we restrict our attention to white dwarf ( wd ) donor models .    the dotted and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ rvm_plot ] show evolutionary sequences of ultracompact binaries with he donor models originally developed for a study of the am cvn ( double wd ) class of ultracompact binaries @xcite . along these curves ,",
    "regions of negative slope correspond to adiabatic donor evolution . in regions of positive slope",
    "the donor is cooling and contracting towards the fully - degenerate he wd @xmath39-@xmath40 relation ( see deloye et al . , 2007 ) , essentially traced by the lowest dotted line in fig .",
    "[ rvm_plot ] .",
    "the donor s cooling is affected by the ( very uncertain ) efficiency with which irradiating flux generated by the accretion  which always dominates the donor s own flux in these ultracompact binaries  is thermalized in the donor s upper atmosphere .",
    "the impact of irradiation is to extend the donor s adiabatic evolution phase and to slow its rate of cooling afterwards .",
    "since calculations similar to the @xcite he - donor study do not yet exist for c / o donors , we compare the j1756 constraints to a sample of pure c models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ solid curves _ in fig .",
    "[ rvm_plot ] ) ; realistic c / o wds will lie at somewhat smaller @xmath40 .",
    "these models assume fully - convective interior profiles and do not explicitly treat thermal transport .",
    "however , the physics that produces the transition from adiabatic evolution to cooling in he donors does not depend on composition and c / o donors will also experience a cooling phase .",
    "this means a substantial fraction of the phase space for `` hot '' c / o donors shown in fig  [ rvm_plot ] will likely not be evolutionarily accessible ( e.g. , the nearly vertical regions of the @xmath56 `` isotherms '' ) , making a c / o donor in j1756 rather unlikely .",
    "thus , j1756 likely harbors a he - dominated donor whose thermal cooling has been at least modestly slowed .",
    "irradiation provides a natural mechanism that is able to affect the necessary degree of slowing , as discussed above .",
    "this interpretation places swift j1756.9@xmath02508 in the company of at least two other x - ray millisecond pulsars with very low mass companions : xte j0929@xmath0314 , @xcite and xte j1807@xmath0294 @xcite ; with its longer orbital period , j1756 provides a unique probe amongst the known ultracompact lmxbs and appears to indicate that irradiation plays a least a modest role in the evolution of the donors in these systems .",
