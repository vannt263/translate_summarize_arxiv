    "along with an increasing amount of dna sequences extracted from experiments , it is important to develop methods for extracting meaningful information from the one - dimensional symbolic sequences composed of the four letters ` a ' , ` c ' , ` g ' and ` t ' ( or ` u ' ) . to detect similarity in dna sequences , scatter plots@xcite are introduced to make classification of cytochromes and illustrate a dendrogram . from a comparison of a pair of duplicated genes by a distance matrix , evolutionary relationship of three primary kingdoms of life",
    "is inferred@xcite . due to",
    "investigating relative abundances of short oligonucleotides in subsequences , genomic signature phenomenon and derivation of partial - ordering relationships among bacterial genomes are proposed@xcite .",
    "the genomic signature describes that the difference of dinucleotide relative abundance values within a single genome is larger than that between distinct genomes .",
    "chaos game representation ( cgr)@xcite , which generates a two - dimensional square from a one - dimensional sequence , provides a technique to visualize the composition of dna sequences . by composing the cgr and short - sequence representation methods ,",
    "the evolution of species - type specificity in mitochondral genomes is analyzed@xcite . in terms of the cgr method",
    ", it is shown that the main characteristics of the whole genome can be exhibited by its subsequences@xcite .",
    "the genomic signature is extended to describe characteristics of cgr images . by making a euclidean metric between two cgr images , classification of species in three primary kingdoms",
    "is discussed .",
    "recently , metric representation ( mr)@xcite , which is borrowed from the symbolic dynamics , makes an ordering of subsequences in a plane .",
    "the mr method is an extension of cgr .",
    "suppression of certain nucleotide strings in the dna sequences leads to a self - similarity of pattern seen in the mr of dna sequences . in this paper ,",
    "first , we show that the mr is one - to - one . due to the mr method , we determine suppression of nucleotide strings in dna sequences .",
    "then , eliminating effects of finite sequences on suppression of nucleotide strings , we give an optimal string length to display genomic signature .",
    "moreover , we plot information function versus string lengths to determine self - similarity limits in mr images . using the method , we present self - similarity limits of bacteria complete genomic signatures .",
    "for a given dna sequence , we have a one - dimensional symbolic sequence @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . in a two - dimensional mr",
    ", we take the correspondence of symbol @xmath2 to number @xmath3 or @xmath4 and calculate the values ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) of all subsequences @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the number @xmath5 represented in base 3 , between 0 and 1 , is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath3 is 0 if @xmath10 or 1 if @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the number @xmath6 is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is 0 if @xmath14 or 1 if @xmath15 . according to ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the one - dimensional symbolic sequence @xmath16 is partitioned into 4 kinds of subsequences , which correspond to points in 4 fundamental zones @xmath17 and @xmath18 of fig .  1 .",
    "under left or right shift operators , each zone can be further shrunk to less zones with a factor of @xmath19 . for an infinite sequence",
    ", this procedure can be defined as a fractal@xcite , which has a self - similarity .",
    "the subsequences with the same ending @xmath20-nucleotide string are labeled by @xmath21 .",
    "all subsequences @xmath21 correspond to points in the zone encoded by the @xmath20-nucleotide string .",
    "* lemma 1 * @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is a left shift operator .",
    "proof : note that for the left shift operator , @xmath24 . from the definition ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we can immediately obtain the result .",
    "* lemma 2 * @xmath25 .",
    "proof : when @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . by the lemma 1",
    ", we can obtain @xmath29 .",
    "suppose when @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 . for @xmath32",
    ", we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 . by the lemma 1 , we obtain @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "so , using the supposition @xmath31 , we can lead to @xmath37 .",
    "by the lemma 2 , each finite subsequence @xmath38 has a correspondent infinite sequence @xmath39 . here",
    ", we define a set of the infinite sequences as @xmath40 .",
    "* theorem 1 * @xmath41 is one - to - one .",
    "@xmath42 is a set of points in the ( @xmath43 ) plane .",
    "this means that given @xmath44 , @xmath45 , if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .",
    "we give a proof by contradiction .",
    "suppose @xmath48 and is marked as @xmath49 in the the ( @xmath43 ) plan .",
    "for the zone including the point @xmath49 , we encode it as two subsequences @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the same mononucleotide . then , enlarge the zone by a area factor of @xmath52 , we can obtain two encoding subsequences @xmath53 and @xmath54 with the same dinucleotide .",
    "each enlarging process provides a right shift to two subsequences . at the same time , the point @xmath49 is only included in one of four enlarged zones .",
    "so , two shifting subsequences are the same .",
    "following the enlarging process in an infinite step , we can obtain @xmath55 , contradicting our original assumption .",
    "this contraction is due to the fact that we have assumed @xmath48 ; thus , @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .    for the dna sequence ,",
    "some zones in cgr are replenished by points , so that a pattern appears . in cgr",
    ", there exists an correspondence of more subsequences with different ending @xmath20-nucleotide strings to the same points in bounds of zones . for examples ,",
    "subsequences @xmath56 in the zone @xmath57 , @xmath58 in the zone @xmath59 , @xmath60 in the zone @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the zone @xmath18 have the same points in cgr ( 1/2,1/2 ) . under left shift operators ,",
    "the corresponding relation between points and subsequences can preserve in zones with small enough lengths .",
    "for example , subsequences @xmath63 in the zone @xmath64 , @xmath65 in the zone @xmath66 , @xmath67 in the zone @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the zone @xmath70 have the same points in cgr ( 1/4,3/4 ) . in mr of dna sequences ,",
    "each zone in cgr is shrunk and clearly divided by four bands .",
    "there exists a one - to - one correspondence between zones and ending @xmath71nucleotide strings of subsequences .",
    "frequency of points in the zone can be determined by using mr method as follows . in order to compute frequencies in zones encoded by @xmath20-nucleotide strings ,",
    "we need to determine partition lines of mr in fig .  1 .",
    "for mononucleotides , there exist @xmath72 zones in the mr . we have @xmath73 partition lines @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 along the @xmath5 axis . for denucleotides , there",
    "exist @xmath77 zones in the mr .",
    "we have @xmath78 partition lines @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 along the @xmath5 axis . in general , for @xmath84-nucleotide strings ,",
    "if knowing @xmath85 partition lines @xmath86 along the @xmath5 axis , we can obtain @xmath87 partition lines @xmath88 for @xmath20-nucleotide strings as follows .",
    "for the @xmath20-nucleotide strings , there exist @xmath89 zones in the mr .",
    "the left half @xmath90 of partition lines along the @xmath5 axis are described as follows @xmath91 from ( 3 ) , the right half @xmath92 of partition lines along the @xmath5 axis can be determined immediately @xmath93 for example , for trinucleotides , 9 partition lines along the @xmath5 axis are @xmath94 and 1 .",
    "we can obtain 17 partition lines @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and 1 along the @xmath5 axis for tetranucleotides .",
    "partition lines along the @xmath6 axis are the same to those along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "each zone in the mr can thus be surrounded by the combined partition lines along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes .    using the mr method , we determine suppression of @xmath20-nucleotide strings in humhbb ( human @xmath6-region , chromosome 11 ) with 73308 bases and yeast1 ( yeast chromosome 1 ) with 230209 bases in table i , respectively . in order to check efficiency of the method",
    ", we also determine the number of disappearing strings in all strings for a giving string length in humhbb and yeast1 , respectively .",
    "the results are identical with those in table i , respectively .",
    "so , the mr method is effective to determine suppression of nucleotide strings in dna sequences .    in cgr of dna sequences ,",
    "self - similarity patterns change more obscurely as lengths of sequences increase .",
    "a grey plot describes frequency values in small zones , which sizes ( @xmath99 ) can be given by lengths of strings encoding the zones ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "along with increase of string lengths , the self - similarity patterns in cgr are more clear .",
    "a high and low frequent zones are redivided to smaller and described by a grey scale .",
    "some empty zones may appear in the patterns of cgr , i.e. , some nucleotide strings are suppressed in the sequences . in the procedure of decreasing zone sizes ,",
    "more and more empty zones emerge in the patterns of cgr .",
    "for example , evolution of a self - similarity pattern in cgr of the archaebacteria archeoglobus fulqidus is shown in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "if dna sequences are infinite , the compositional structure can be displayed in small enough zones .",
    "empty zones are a part of the global feature in cgr . but the dna sequences are finite .",
    "a finite sequence , even a random sequence , may also lead to suppression of strings .",
    "along with increase of string length , more and more strings are suppressed in the finite sequences .    in table",
    "i , we compare the suppression of nucleotide strings between dna and random sequences with the same length .",
    "suppression of nucleotide strings for humhbb starts at @xmath20=5 . for a random sequence with the same length , which is given by using a random number generator@xcite , suppression of nucleotide strings",
    "is delayed to start at @xmath20=7 .",
    "the number of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number is 5.67% of that for humhbb . the finite sequence of humhbb effects on the suppression of 7-nucleotide strings . along with increase of @xmath20 , numbers of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number more increase and approach those for humhbb . at @xmath10010 , the number of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number is 99.3% of that for humhbb .",
    "in this case , suppression of nucleotide strings in humhbb is mainly caused by the finite length of sequence . moreover , suppression of nucleotide strings for yeast1 starts at @xmath20=7 .",
    "for a random sequence with the same length , which is given by using a random number generator@xcite , suppression of nucleotide strings is delayed to start at @xmath20=8 .",
    "the number of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number is 22.7% of that for yeast1 . the finite sequence of yeast1 effects on the suppression of 8-nucleotide strings . at @xmath20=10 ,",
    "the number of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number is 97.5% of that for yeast1 . due to the comparison of suppression of nucleotide strings",
    ", we can thus obtain that humhbb and yeast1 have shorter suppressed nucleotide strings than random sequences with the same lengths , respectively . along with increase of string lengths , the finite sequences take stronger effects on suppression of nucleotide strings .    in order to display genomic signature",
    ", we must eliminate effects of finite sequences on suppression of nucleotide strings .",
    "for a dna sequence , we take the longest string length before suppression of nucleotide strings in a random sequence with the same lengths as an optimal option of string lengths . according to the definition , string lengths 6 and 7 can be chosen as optimal options for genomic signatures of humhbb and yeast1 , respectively .",
    "suppression of certain nucleotide strings in the dna sequences leads to a fractal pattern seen in the mr of dna sequences . to quantify the fractal feature in the mr of dna sequences ,",
    "we introduce information dimension . for a given length @xmath20 of nucleotide strings , we have @xmath101 subsequences @xmath102 , which end with @xmath103 @xmath20-nucleotide strings .",
    "the subsequences are corresponding to @xmath103 points in a mr . in the mr ,",
    "the length of a zone and the total number of zones are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the numbers of points falling in the @xmath106-th zone and of non - empty zones are labeled by @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . dividing the number @xmath107 by the total point number @xmath103 yields a probability @xmath109 for the @xmath106-th zone .",
    "information function and dimension for the points in mr are respectively defined@xcite as @xmath110 and @xmath111 the information function @xmath112 during a range of @xmath113 has a scaling region .",
    "the scaling region reflects the self - similarity of pattern in the mr .",
    "the information dimension @xmath114 can be found from the slope in scaling region @xmath112 versus @xmath113 .",
    "when the length @xmath115 of a zone in mr increases from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , mr of dna sequences changes to cgr .",
    "information dimension in cgr can thus be determined as @xmath118 .",
    "we compute information function @xmath112 with different sizes @xmath115 for humhbb and draw in fig .  2 . a linear part of the curve @xmath112 versus @xmath113 emerges between @xmath119 and @xmath120=6.59 .",
    "a fitting line is also draw in fig .  2 .",
    "the point for @xmath121=7.69 is started leaving from the line .",
    "along with the decrease of @xmath113 , farther and farther the points leave from the line . since points in the zones correspond to @xmath20-nucleotide strings",
    ", we can obtain that the self - similarity of pattern in the mr preserves approximately from mononucleotides to @xmath122-nucleotide strings , as well as the suppression of many nucleotide strings emerges at @xmath123-nucleotide strings . using the least - squares",
    "fit method@xcite for the liner part , we determine its slope , i.e. , information dimension @xmath114 , to 1.20 .",
    "it is less than the information dimension 1.26 for random sequence with the same length .",
    "moreover , in fig .  3 , we draw information function @xmath112 versus @xmath113 for yeast1 . a linear part of the curve @xmath112 versus @xmath113 exists between @xmath119 and @xmath121=7.69 .",
    "we can obtain that the suppression of many nucleotide strings in yeast1 emerges from @xmath124-nucleotide strings . using the least - squares fit method@xcite for the liner part , we also plot a fitting line in fig .  3 and determine its slope , i.e. , information dimension @xmath114 , to 1.22 .",
    "it is less than the information dimension 1.26 for random sequence with the same length .",
    "the limits of self - similarity in mr of humhbb and yeast1 are equivalent to the optimal string lengths for genomic signatures , respectively .",
    "thus , for presenting genomic signature , a self - similarity limit as an optimal string length can be determined in computing information dimension .    using the mr method",
    ", we determine suppression of @xmath20-nucleotide strings of bacteria complete genomes in table ii , where we put suppression of @xmath20-nucleotide strings in the order of decrease .",
    "for each of the bacteria complete genomes , a linear part exists in the plot of information function @xmath112 versus @xmath113 . from the linear parts , we determine self - similarity limits of genomic signatures in table ii .",
    "keeping in the order , we find the suppression of bacteria complete genomes does not necessarily depend on the lengths of sequences . the common optimal string length for the bacteria complete genomic signatures can be chosen as 7 .",
    "in summary , we have shown mr of dna sequences is one - to - one . due to the mr method , suppression of nucleotide strings in the dna sequences",
    "is determined . for a dna sequence ,",
    "an optimal string length to display genomic signature is obtained by eliminating effects of the finite sequence .",
