    "in the present work we study the dynamical evolution of an extrasolar planetary system which is close to the 1/1 resonance . it is known ( hadjidemetriou 2002 ; hadjidemetriou 2006 ; beaug et al .",
    "2003 ) that families of periodic orbits exist in the three body problem , in a rotating frame , consisting of a star ( with a large mass ) and two bodies with small masses ( planets or satellites ) that interact gravitationally .",

    "we remark that these families of 1/1 resonant periodic orbits studied here do not emanate from trojan like orbits ( e.g. schwarz et al .",
    "2009 ) and are called by some authors `` quasi - satellite orbits '' ( mikkola et al . 2006 ; giuppone et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "in this work we consider that , in addition to the gravitational forces between the three bodies , non conservative forces also act on the planets . if we assume that the planetary system is not yet fully developed and a proto - planetary nebula exists , then the motion of the planets is affected by the drag which is due to the interaction between the planets and the proto - planetary nebula .",
    "such a dissipation effect lasts until this nebula is dissolved and the system takes its final form .",
    "this kind of study has been made in order to explain the large eccentricities , or the very close proximity of the planets , and the resonance trapping in several observed extrasolar planetary systems ( beaug and ferraz - mello 1993 ; gomes 1996 ; ferraz - mello et al .",
