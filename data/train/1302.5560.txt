    "einstein s theory of general relativity describes gravitational phenomena ranging from planetary motion to cosmology . among the plethora of solutions of the einstein equations",
    "there are also the wormhole solutions @xcite .",
    "wormholes are a hypothetical topological feature of space - time that correspond to  tunnels \" through space - time . in 1935",
    "@xcite the `` einstein - rosen bridge '' was discovered as a feature of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "it represents a space - time manifold consisting of two asymptotically flat universes connected by a throat .",
    "wormholes that connect two distant regions of our own universe were discussed by wheeler in the 1950 s @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that this kind of wormholes would collapse if one tried to pass them @xcite .",
    "wormholes which could actually be crossed in both directions , are known as _",
    "traversable wormholes_. traversable wormholes were considered in @xcite when a new kind of matter was coupled to gravity , whose energy - momentum tensor would violate all ( null , weak and strong ) energy conditions . a suitable candidate would be a phantom field , i.e. a scalar field with a reversed sign in front of its kinetic term @xcite . wormholes with such phantom fields have been studied in a variety of settings , including stars and neutron stars @xcite . however , the presence of a phantom field is _ not _ necessary to obtain wormholes .",
    "for example , they occur in theories when instead of einstein gravity higher curvature terms are considered , such as @xmath0-theories or einstein - gau - bonnet - dilaton theories @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate wormhole solutions when a phantom field and chiral fields are minimally coupled to einstein gravity . for the chiral fields we first take the non - linear sigma model , and subsequently allow for the presence of a higher order term , i.e. a skyrme term .",
    "our motive is based on the previous observations that _ the presence of non - abelian fields can lead to new interesting gravitational phenomena , since `` hairy black holes '' were discovered in the einstein - skyrme model _ @xcite .    here",
    "we restrict to static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions connecting two asymptotically flat universes .",
    "the solutions are characterized by three parameters : the coupling constant to gravity @xmath1 , the radius of the throat of the wormhole , and the value of the chiral fields at the throat . in particular , we study the dependence of the wormhole solutions on these parameters . thereby we find that the geometry of the wormhole changes as the gravitational coupling is increased . instead of possessing a single minimal radius ,",
    "the wormhole develops a maximal radius surrounded by two minimal radii , i.e. , a double throat forms . at a critical coupling ,",
    "the two throats reach zero size .",
    "then the space - time inbetween the two throats forms a closed universe , which pinches off from the two exterior universes .    our main focus is on wormholes that are symmetric under the interchange of the two asymptotically flat universes .",
    "we consider these solutions as chiral configurations localized in the vicinity of the throat . in the case of a skyrmion",
    ", they might give us an idea of the mechanism taken place when such an extended particle is passing the throat . besides the symmetric wormholes we also consider non - symmetric wormholes , by changing the boundary condition of the chiral fields at the throat .",
    "stability is an essential question for traversable wormholes .",
    "recently , it was shown that wormholes minimally coupled to a phantom field possess an unstable mode @xcite . however , self - gravitating skyrmions possess a conserved topological charge and are stable @xcite ; and likewise , black holes with skyrmionic hair are linearly stable @xcite .",
    "thus one may ask , whether this stability exists also for wormholes permeated by chiral fields .",
    "after all they _ do _ possess a conserved topological charge .",
    "however , they may also inherit the unstable mode of the ellis wormhole @xcite . to answer this question",
    ", we study small spherically symmetric perturbations of the wormholes with chiral fields . we impose a harmonic time - dependence on the perturbations and find that all wormholes retain the unstable mode of the ellis wormhole .",
    "thus they are all , linearly unstable .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section ii , we present the action , the anstze and the field equations .",
    "we discuss the main wormhole features in section iii .",
    "the numerical results for the symmetric wormholes are presented in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the stability analysis of these solutions .",
    "we report the main results for the non - symmetric wormholes in section vi , and give the conclusions in section vii .",
    "we consider einstein gravity coupled to a phantom field and ordinary matter fields . the action @xmath2",
    "\\sqrt{-g}\\   d^4x     \\label{action}\\ ] ] consists of the einstein - hilbert action with curvature scalar @xmath3 , newton s constant @xmath4 and determinant of the metric @xmath5 , and of the corresponding matter contributions .",
    "these are the lagrangian of the phantom field @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the non - linear sigma model lagrangian @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a coupling constant .",
    "the chiral matrix @xmath11 is a function on the space - time manifold taking values in the lie group su(2 ) .",
    "the last term in the action represents the skyrme term @xmath12 with @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 a coupling constant .",
    "variation of the action with respect to the metric leads to the einstein equations @xmath15 with stress - energy tensor @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the matter lagrangian .      for the study of static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions an appropriate choice for the line element would be @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the metric of the unit sphere , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath22 .",
    "note that the coordinate @xmath22 takes positive and negative values , i.e. @xmath23 . the limits @xmath24 correspond to two disjoint asymptotically flat regions .",
    "we parametrize the chiral matrix as @xmath25 with the unit vector field @xmath26 @xmath27 and the vector of pauli matrices @xmath28 .",
    "the chiral profile function @xmath29 is a function of @xmath22 .",
    "substitution of the above anstze into the einstein equations @xmath30 yields @xmath31 for the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 components , respectively .",

    "the equations for the chiral profile function and the phantom field are obtained from the variation of the action with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "thus , the phantom field can be eliminated from the einstein equations by the substitution @xmath39 .",
    "next we introduce dimensionless quantities via scaling @xmath40 this is equivalent to setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we rename @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 to simplify the notation .",

    "( [ eeq_tt ] ) and eq .",

    "the maximum is a local maximum since in the asymptotic regions @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that there are ( at least ) two minima of @xmath21 , one for @xmath60 and another one for @xmath61 .",
    "the wormhole then has a double throat . for a sequence of alternating minima and maxima the spatial hyper - surfaces would also possess two asymptotically flat regions , but they would be separated by a sequence of throats , thus a true multi - throat wormhole would arise .      for the position of the throat - or beyond @xmath62 of the maximal area surface , i.e. , the equator - we can choose without loss of generality @xmath63 . at this extremal surface - the throat or the equator -",
    "we then impose the conditions @xmath64 the first condition fixes the areal radius of the throat or the equator , and the second is the extremum condition .",
    "the third condition fixes the value of the chiral profile function at the throat or the equator , which is a free parameter . in this study",
    "we will first focus on the special case @xmath65 , when the wormhole solutions are symmetric under the interchange of the asymptotic regions .",
    "subsequently , we will consider non - symmetric wormhole solutions .    in the asymptotic regions we impose the following boundary conditions :",
    "@xmath66 the first condition sets the time scale , whereas the second and third conditions result from requiring finite energy and topological charge @xmath67 .      in order to identify the topological charge of the solutions , we consider the chiral matrix @xmath11 as a map of spatial slices of the wormhole space - time to the group manifold @xmath68 . since @xmath11 takes constant values in both asymptotic regions we can contract each of these regions to a point .",
    "the spatial slices then become topologically equivalent to a three dimensional sphere , where the north and south pole correspond to the asymptotic regions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "thus the chiral matrix can be regarded as a map between two three - spheres , and the topological charge is defined as the degree of the map . with the ansatz for the chiral matrix eq .",
    "( [ skyrmu ] ) and the above asymptotic boundary conditions for the profile function @xmath29 with @xmath71 the topological charge is equal to one .",
    "in this section we focus on wormholes that are symmetric under the interchange of the asymptotic regions . for the numerical calculations , we re - parametrize the function @xmath21 as @xmath72 , since the new function @xmath73 is bounded in the full interval @xmath74 , in contrast to @xmath21 .",
    "then , the boundary conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 translate into @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .    to obtain wormholes symmetric with respect to the throat ( or beyond @xmath62 to the maximum ) , i.e. @xmath79 , we require for the chiral field that @xmath80 is an odd function in @xmath22 .",

    "the wormhole then exhibits a set of three extrema , a ( local ) maximal surface and two minimal surfaces located symmetrically , one on each side .",
    "thus the wormhole possesses a double throat with a belly in the interior .",
    "as @xmath1 increases further the chiral fields become more and more localized in the inner region of the belly . at the maximal coupling @xmath180 finally , the chiral fields are fully localized inside this inner region , while the areal radius of the two throats decreases to zero . the space - time",
    "then splits into three parts .",
    "the outer parts correspond to empty minkowski spaces , while the inner part corresponds to an einstein universe with a chiral field carrying topological charge one .    in the presence of a skyrme term",
    ", we have one more free parameter . thus we can vary the gravitational coupling and the throat size independently .",
    "with increasing @xmath1 we again observe an increasing influence of the matter on the geometry of the throat , and the formation of two throats with an inner belly beyond a critical value @xmath62 .",
    "the splitting of the space - time into three parts is , however , less smooth than in the nls case .",
    "by choosing the boundary conditions asymmetrically with respect to the throat we can distribute the chiral fields asymmetrically with respect to the two asymptotically flat universes .",
    "then the deformation of the wormhole by the matter is asymmetric as well . consequently ,",
    "when the single throat splits into a double throat at a critical coupling , the two throats develop asymmetrically with respect to their location and size .",
    "this may possibly lead to only a single throat reaching zero , resulting in a breakup of the space - time into only two parts at a maximal coupling .",
    "let us now think of the skyrmionic wormholes as skyrmions passing a wormhole . clearly , one would have to make time - dependent calculations to model such a transit .",
    "however , the static calculations may already give us some hints of what to expect .",
    "in particular , we conclude that the skyrmions will deform the wormhole geometry and possibly even let the space - time pinch , resulting in two or three disconnected parts .",
    "let us conclude by stating that the chiral fields can not stabilize the wormhole space - time .",
    "the instability of the ellis solution is inherited by the wormholes threaded by chiral fields , although they _ do _ carry a topological charge . according to our observations",
    "this is not surprising though , since the topological charge may finally simply reside in a single of several disconnected space - time parts .",
