    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are believed to be `` magnetars ''  a small class of slowly spinning neutron stars with extremely high surface magnetic fields , @xmath4 g @xcite .",
    "they have been discovered through their transient x - ray outbursts , during which they emit hundreds of short ( @xmath5s ) , soft ( @xmath6kev ) bursts ; very rarely ( only twice so far ) , sgrs emit giant flares ( gf ) , extreme events with luminosities upwards of @xmath7 .",
    "sgr  @xmath0 lies in the galactic plane , at a distance of about @xmath8kpc @xcite .",
    "the third gf yet recorded occurred on 27 dec .",
    "2004 , when sgr  @xmath0 emitted a burst so extreme that it was the brightest extra - solar transient event ever recorded @xcite .",
    "the flare was also unique in creating a very bright radio afterglow @xcite , which was monitored for months , providing an amazing wealth of data at several radio frequencies , including the temporal evolution of the source size and shape , polarization and flux .",
    "the data from the radio source that appeared in the aftermath of the gf provide a rare opportunity for a detailed study of a mildly relativistic blast wave , which might help bridge the gap between the relativistic outflows in cosmological gamma - ray bursts and supernova remnants .",
    "@xcite present a rebrightening episode in the radio light curve , which is well fit by a semi - analytic spherical model where the radio emission resulted from a blast wave driven by @xmath9 g of baryonic material driven off the neutron star , and the expanding radio nebula has now entered its sedov - taylor phase of evolution .",
    "an accompanying study of the evolution of the size of the nebula confirms that it is indeed decelerating @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the motion of the flux centroid implies a predominantly one - sided mildly collimated outflow , i.e. a wide one - sided jet @xcite .    in this paper , we expand on the framework laid out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and present a full dynamical model for the interaction of the outflow that was ejected during the 2004 dec .",
    "27 gf with its surroundings , and in particular with an external shell .",
    "our model , which is described in  [ dynamics ] , explains the large and diverse data sets for this event and constrains the initial velocity of the ejecta from the flare .",
    "both a relativistic (  [ rel ] ) and a newtonian (  [ newt ] ) outflow are considered .",
    "we find that only a newtonian outflow with an initial expansion velocity @xmath10 fits the observations well . in ",
    "[ emission ] we derive the synchrotron emission implied by our dynamical model and show that it also agrees nicely with the radio observations .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in  [ diss ] .",
    "the radio light curve initially exhibited a relatively moderate decay , @xmath11 , followed by an achromatic steepening at @xmath12days after the gf , to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this was followed by a rebrightening starting at @xmath14days and peaking at @xmath15days @xcite ; the decay rate slowed significantly thereafter ( @xmath16 ; gelfand et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the apparent expansion velocity , @xmath17 , of the nebula was initially fairly constant , days , which is slightly higher than the value reported initially by @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath18 , and decreased at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath20 is for the geometrical mean of the semi - major axis and semi - minor axis , and assumes a double sided outflow . under the latter assumption , @xmath20 along the semi - major axis and semi - minor axis in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "however , as the motion of the flux centroid implies that the sgr is located close to the edge of the image along the semi - major axis @xcite , this implies @xmath23 for the leading edge of the one - sided outflow .",
    "the true velocity ( in units of @xmath24 ) of the emitting material near the edge of the image is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle between its direction of motion and the line of sight .",
    "the minimal true velocity corresponding to a given observed value of @xmath27 is @xmath28 or @xmath29 and is obtained for an angle @xmath30 that satisfies @xmath31 . the same angle , @xmath32 , is where @xmath33 is maximal for a fixed @xmath34 ( and therefore @xmath35 at the outer edge of the image of a spherical source expanding at a velocity @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath36 , and in our case @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 or @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "since the axis ratio of the radio image at the times relevant for our modeling is at most @xmath41 , and for the sake of simplicity , we adopt a spherical model for most of our analysis , and later introduce the corrections for a mildly collimated one sided outflow , as is implied by the observations .",
    "as the source was already fading by the time of the first observation ( @xmath42days ) , the radio emission must have turned on at an earlier time and at a smaller radius .",
    "the radio spectrum and linear polarization observations suggest that we are seeing synchrotron emission .",
    "if the relativistic electrons that are emitting this radiation were accelerated at a much smaller radius ( @xmath43 cm ) then most of their energy would have been lost via adiabatic cooling by @xmath44 , thus dramatically increasing the gf energy requirements .",
    "moreover , the achromatic light curve steepening at @xmath45 @xcite , strongly suggests a hydrodynamic transition at that time .",
    "a simple explanation for this overall behavior arises if the outflow from the gf initially coasted with negligible interaction with the ambient medium , until at @xmath46days it collided with a thin external shell , which caused it to decelerate by a reverse shock , while the external shell was accelerated by a forward shock . through the ism and its quiescent wind @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it could also arise from an earlier and initially faster mass ejection from the sgr  @xmath0 gf , which was decelerated by the external medium to a velocity slightly below that of the coasting second shell , thus causing the two shells to collide ( the  refreshed shock ",
    "scenario , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . ] after this collision the two shells move together at a somewhat reduced speed .",
    "thus the emission up to @xmath45 is dominated by the _ recently _ shocked electrons in these two shells .",
    "the radiation then arrives at the observer at a time @xmath47 due to light travel effects and the finite time it takes for the shock to cross the shells . at @xmath48",
    "the emission is dominated by the adiabatically cooling electrons in the two shells . as shown in  [ emission ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this naturally produces the unusually steep decay in the light curve .",
    "as the merged shell expands outwards it drives a shock into the ambient medium .",
    "an increasing amount of external mass is swept up , until the emission from this shocked fluid starts dominating the light curve at @xmath49days .",
    "this naturally produces a rebrightening in the light curve which peaks at @xmath15days @xcite ; as expected , a decrease in the expansion velocity was observed at about the same time , @xmath19 ( taylor et al . 2005 ) . at @xmath50",
    "the hydrodynamics gradually approach the self - similar sedov - taylor solution , which predicts a slower flux decay rate , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "an outline of our basic picture is shown in panel * a * of fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "below we reproduce the main observed features using a simple analytic model for the interaction between the outflow and its surroundings , and present a numerical simulation that broadly agrees with the analytic model and nicely reproduces the observed evolution of the source size .",
    "a simple model for the collision between the cold ejecta shell of initial lorentz factor @xmath51 and mass @xmath52 , and an external thin shell of mass @xmath53 at rest at a radius @xmath54 , is a plastic collision where the two shells are shocked ( the two shocked fluids separated by a contact discontinuity ) and subsequently move together at @xmath55 . both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are measured in the rest frame of the unperturbed external medium .",
    "energy and momentum conservation in the rest frame of the merged shell require @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , where @xmath60 is the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta in the rest frame of the merged shell . the resulting internal energy is @xmath61 and the final velocity is @xmath62 this shows that an external mass of @xmath63 is required in order to significantly reduce the initial velocity .    for an _ initially _ relativistic outflow @xmath64 and @xmath65 so that @xmath66 , which for @xmath67 ( and correspondingly @xmath68 ) gives @xmath69",
    ". therefore , in this limit , the kinetic energy of the merged shell carries only a small fraction ( @xmath70 ) of the total energy , while most of the energy is in the internal energy of the shocked ejecta ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the relativistically hot shocked ejecta can then convert most of its internal energy back into kinetic energy through @xmath72 work as the merged shell keeps expanding .",
    "this might initially ( soon after the collision ) accelerate the shell , and later cause it to decelerate more slowly with time ( and radius ) , thus increasing the radius , @xmath73 , where it decelerates significantly , compared to its value for a cold shell with the same ( post collision ) mass and velocity , @xmath74 .    nevertheless , even if all the original energy is back in the form of kinetic energy at @xmath73 , then still @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total mass ( in the shells and swept - up external medium ) at @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "finally , @xmath79 for most reasonable scenarios that produce an external shell , such as a bow shock @xcite .",
    ", then @xmath80 would increase by a factor of @xmath81 so that @xmath82 would be required in order to explain the observed evolution of the source size .",
    "therefore , an external shell with @xmath82 , or alternatively a sharp density drop by a factor of @xmath83 around @xmath54 that lasts for at least an order of magnitude in radius , would in principle be consistent with the observations . in practice , however , such external density profiles seem highly contrived and therefore not very likely . ]",
    "this gives @xmath84    we now proceed to compare the radio observations with the above calculations .",
    "the angular diameter of the source at the time of the first observation , @xmath42days , and at the epoch of deceleration , @xmath85days , was about @xmath86mas and @xmath87mas , respectively .",
    "the corresponding radii are @xmath88 cm and @xmath89 cm .",

    "[ mass_ratio ] for any reasonable value of @xmath93 .",
    "thus , an ultra - relativistic outflow ( @xmath94 ) fails to reproduce the observations , since @xmath73 would not be much larger than @xmath54 ; specifically we expect @xmath95 ( see eq .",
    "[ mass_ratio ] ) .      for a newtonian outflow ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "[ beta_f ] reduces to @xmath97 , where @xmath98 . since @xmath99 and @xmath100 ,",

    "we directly measure the source size , @xmath73 , and expansion velocity , @xmath110 . therefore , since the shocked external medium has comparable internal and kinetic energies , the energy in the outflow is given by @xmath111erg , and depends only on the unknown external density , @xmath112 . here",
    "@xmath113 and @xmath114erg ) .",
    "thus @xmath115 and @xmath116 g . these results for @xmath117 and @xmath118 are similar to those derived by @xcite .",
    "a simple generalization for a wide one - sided jet is as follows . the volume of the shocked external fluid and therefore its mass for a given external density does not change .",
    "the kinetic energy per unit rest energy , @xmath119 , grows by a factor of @xmath120 at the head of the jet ( where @xmath121 , see beginning of  [ dynamics ] ) and decreases near the sgr . on average",
    "it increases by a factor of @xmath122 , and the estimate for @xmath123 increases by the same factor while @xmath124 does not change .    finally , it is important to keep in mind that the outflow might consist of more than one component .",
    "the simplest example is a relativistic shell ( with @xmath125 ) followed by a newtonian shell ( with @xmath126 ) that was ejected slightly later during the gf .",
    "the relativistic shell is shocked and decelerated to a newtonian velocity as it collides with the external shell , at @xmath127 , while the newtonian shell catches up and collides with the slower merged relativistic + external shell at @xmath128 . as long as the velocity after the first collision is sufficiently smaller than that of the newtonian shell",
    ", the subsequent dynamics would not be very different than for the newtonian outflow case discussed above .",
    "an important difference , however , is that the emission would light up at @xmath129 , i.e. much earlier than without the relativistic component .",
    "( a similar result is obtained also if there is a continuous external medium instead of a shell surrounding a cavity . )",
    "rapid follow - up observations of future gfs could test this hypothesis directly , and teach us more about the properties of the outflow . in the present case",
    ", the later collision with the newtonian shell might explain the change in the degree of linear polarization ( from decreasing to increasing with time ) and its position angle , at @xmath130days @xcite .",
    "we have tested the colliding shell scenario with the aid of numerical simulations , which model the dynamics much more accurately than the simple analytic model used above .",

    "the two asymptotic power laws correspond to the coasting phase and the sedov - taylor regime . a semi - analytic model which gives a smooth transition between these two asymptotic power laws is presented in fig . 2 of @xcite and fitted to the source size as a function of time in fig . 2 of @xcite",
    ". around the time of the collision , @xmath132",
    ", there is a flat part in @xmath133 due to the shocks that are crossing both shells .",
    "this flat part is nicely reproduced by the numerical simulation , and its exact shape depends on the details of the collision ( and thus does not have a simple and robust analytic description ) . in a future work ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",

    "an alternative mechanism for producing the external shell is the ejection of a faster ( and likely highly relativistic ) component of the ejecta which carries a small fraction , @xmath250 , of its total energy , just before ( or in a slightly different direction relative to ) the main part of the ejecta which carries most of its energy and is only mildly relativistic .",

    "<S> on 2004 dec . 27 , the soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) @xmath0 emitted the brightest giant flare ( gf ) ever detected from an sgr . </S>",
    "<S> this burst of energy , which resulted in an ( isotropic ) energy release @xmath1 times greater than the only two other known sgr gfs , was followed by a very bright , fading radio afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> extensive follow - up radio observations provided a wealth of information with unprecedented astrometric precision , revealing the temporal evolution of the source size , along with densely sampled light curves and spectra . here </S>",
    "<S> we expand on our previous work on this source , by explaining these observations within one self - consistent dynamical model . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the early radio emission is due to the outflow ejected during the gf energizing a thin shell surrounding a pre - existing cavity , where the observed steep temporal decay of the radio emission seen beginning on day 9 is attributed to the adiabatic cooling of the shocked shell . </S>",
    "<S> the shocked ejecta and external shell move outward together , driving a forward shock into the ambient medium , and are eventually decelerated by a reverse shock . as we show in gelfand et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 ) , the radio emission from the shocked external medium naturally peaks when significant deceleration occurs , and then decays relatively slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical modeling of the collision between the ejecta and the external shell together with the observed evolution of the source size ( which is nicely reproduced in our model ) suggest that most of the energy in the outflow was in mildly relativistic material , with an initial expansion velocity @xmath2 , for a distance of @xmath3kpc to sgr  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an initially highly relativistic outflow would not have produced a long coasting phase at a mildly relativistic expansion velocity , as was observed . </S>"
