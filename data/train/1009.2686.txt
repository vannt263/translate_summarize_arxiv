    "extragalactic x - ray sources with luminosities in excess of 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 have now been widely detected in the nearby universe ( fabbiano 1989 ; miller & colbert 2004 ; roberts 2007 ) .",
    "these are designated as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) if they are not coincident with the nucleus of their host galaxy ( i.e. an agn ) nor correspond to a foreground or background object , e.g. a qso .",
    "they are too luminous to be powered by a sub - eddington accretion flow in a stellar - mass black hole binary ( bhb ) unless substantial beaming of their emission is invoked ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , so either require super - eddington mass accretion onto a stellar mass black hole , or sub - eddington accretion onto an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ; see colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "unambiguously distinguishing between these possibilities requires radial velocity measurements of the underlying binary motion to directly determine the mass ( see e.g. charles & coe 2006 ) .",
    "until these become available , we can only use more indirect arguments to identify the nature of these objects , primarily by comparing the x- ray spectral and timing properties of ulxs with those of stellar - mass bhbs ( see e.g. the review by roberts 2007 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of ulxs can be fairly well described by a two component ( disc plus power - law ) model , as commonly used for bhbs .",
    "taking the disc temperatures at face value implies masses of order 10@xmath410@xmath5m@xmath1 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ; miller et al . 2003",
    "; miller et al . 2004a ; cropper et al . 2004 ; dewangan et al .",
    "2004 ; roberts et al .",
    "2005 ) , favouring sub - eddington accretion flows onto an imbh ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "however , the disc component generally does not dominate these spectra , and bhbs show that in these circumstances the derived disc radii vary dramatically , so can not be used to estimate mass ( kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "kajava & poutanen ( 2009 ) show that this cool disc component varies as @xmath6 , implying that the radius of the thermally emitting material increases with increasing luminosity , in sharp contrast to the @xmath7 expected from a disc with constant inner radius ( see also feng & kaaret 2009 ) .",
    "the observed behaviour may instead be produced from a super - eddington source powering a strong wind , where the photosphere of the wind expands with increasing luminosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; king & pounds 2003 ; begelman , king & pringle 2006 ; poutanen et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "while the disc spectrum is ambiguous , the power - law is somewhat clearer in distinguishing between imbh and stellar mass systems ( or rather in distinguishing between sub and super - eddington accretion ) .",
    "sources with the highest quality data show clear signs that the high energy ` power - law ' tail rolls over above 6  kev , so it is better fit by low temperature thermal comptonisation ( stobbart , roberts , & wilms 2006 ; miyawaki et al .",
    "2009 ) . a rollover at such low temperatures is not seen in any of the sub - eddington bhbs",
    ", so this suggests that ulxs are super - eddington and in a new , _ ultraluminous _ state ( roberts 2007 ; gladstone et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter g09 ; vierdayanti et al .",
    "similarly , low temperature thermal comptonisation is also required in the brightest narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s , e.g. re j1034 + 396 ) and the brightest bhb in our own galaxy , grs 1915 + 105 ( zdziarski et al . 2001 ; middleton et al . 2009 ; ueda et al . 2009 ) .",
    "super - eddington accretion then implies a much smaller mass black hole in ulxs , of the order 10 - 100  m@xmath1 .",
    "another diagnostic of the nature of the accretion flow is its rapid variability as this is strongly correlated with spectral state .",
    "sub - eddington bhbs show power density spectra ( pds ) which can be very roughly described by band limited noise , with a low frequency break at @xmath8 from a slope of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , followed by a high frequency break , @xmath11 , to @xmath12 .",
    "this broad - band noise is often accompanied by strong low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ) which correlate with the low frequency break ( @xmath13 : wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "the lfqpo increases in frequency , coherence and power as the source flux increases and the spectrum softens from a faint low - hard state through the hard - intermediate state up to the soft - intermediate state ( belloni , mndez & homan 2005 ; van der klis 2004 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . during this transition ,",
    "the broad - band power spectrum narrows in @xmath14 , with @xmath8 increasing while the power at high frequencies remains fairly constant ( czerny et al .",
    "2008 ; done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "l    whilst the characteristic breaks are difficult to constrain in the low signal - to - noise ulx data ( see heil , vaughan & roberts 2009 ) , qpo features are much easier to measure .",
    "three ulxs are known to demonstrate strong qpos in their pds , m82 x-1 ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) , ngc 5408 x-1 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter s07 ; strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 , hereafter sm09 ) and , more recently , a second source in m82 ( feng , rao , & kaaret 2010 ) . identifying these with the type c lfqpo seen in sub - eddington bhbs",
    "implies that these are all imbhs ( casella et al . 2008 ; s07 ; sm09 ) .",
    "however , it also implies that the power spectra should show a low frequency break , and that the energy spectra should be consistent with a low - hard or very high state as these are the states in which the lfqpo is seen .",
    "we reanalyse the data from ngc 5408 x-1 , looking at both spectra and variability , and show that neither the energy spectra nor power spectra support the identification of the qpo with the standard lfqpo seen in sub - eddington bhbs .",
    "instead we show that the spectra , power spectra , and variability as a function of energy are all better matched by a super - eddington flow , implying a stellar mass compact object , in which case the qpo may be analogous to the milli - hz qpos seen in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "l    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we can further resolve the variability by looking at long and short timescales .",
    "we recalculate the rms using a binning of 50  s , to show only the power on long timescales ( red points ) .",
    "this shows a very similar pattern of variability to that derived from the total lightcurve , with much more variability at hard energies than at soft .",
    "the blue points show the energy dependence of the rapid variability , formed from the difference ( in quadrature ) between @xmath15 from the 10  s binning and that from the 50  s binning .",
    "thus this effectively isolates variability between frequencies of 0.01 - 0.05  hz , but again the pattern of variability with energy is very similar .",
    "both observations show a very similar pattern , but the rms variability at 1 - 2  kev is even larger for obs 2 than obs 1 .",
    "the black points in fig 6 show the ratio of the total rms spectrum in obs 2 compared to obs 1 , while the red and blue points show the ratio of rms for the long and short timescale variability respectively . apart from on short timescales ,",
    "these show significantly more variability above 1  kev in obs 2 , as expected from the power spectral analysis ( fig 4 ) .",
    "thus , variability on all timescales and in both observations shows a strong increase as a function of energy .",
    "this is consistent with a model in which there is a relatively stable component at soft energies diluting the variability as might be expected by a thermal disc ( see churazov et al .",
    "2001 ) or optically thick photospheric component ( g09 , zdziarski , misra & gierliski 2010 ) .",
    "this can be modelled by changing the normalisation of the hard energy spectral component by the percentage rms and taking the ratio of this to the best - fit model .",
    "the result on 10s binning is shown as the solid black line in fig 5 , which closely resembles the shape of the rms .",
    "we note that the shape of this rms is inconsistent with models in which the spectrum is dominated by a single component which changes only in normalisation .",
    "this would give an rms which is constant with energy .",
    "this rules out the reflection dominated model of caballero - garcia & fabian ( 2010 ) unless the variability is strongly fine - tuned .",
    "the rms shape requires that the unseen illuminating power - law spectrum pivots around 0.3  kev ( see the spectral and rms analysis of a reflection dominated model for re j1034 + 396 in middleton et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the spectral and rms analysis presented here both support a two - component model , where the soft component can be modelled by low temperature thermal emission that is mostly constant on timescales of up to a day , while the hard component , best modelled by a cool , optically thick corona , is steep and varies quite dramatically on timescales down to at least a hundred seconds . whilst this superficially resembles the properties of the steep power - law state ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) seen at fairly high luminosities ,",
    "both the spectra and variability are inconsistent with such an interpretation .",
    "the low temperature of the thermal component means that if this were from an accretion disc then the black hole mass is of order @xmath16 .",
    "a similarly large mass is derived if the qpos are identified with the bhb type c lfqpo . however , the ulx luminosity of @xmath17  ergs s@xmath3 is then only @xmath18 .",
    "bhbs have hard tails ( @xmath19 ) at such low mass accretion rates , rather than the soft tailseen in ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "similarly , the bhb power spectra at these low mass accretion rates show a low frequency break tightly correlated with the qpo frequency .",
    "these breaks are not present at the predicted frequency in ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "soft , variable tails are only seen in bhbs in the steep power - law state , at @xmath20 ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) , giving a mass of @xmath21 if ngc 5408 x-1 is in an analogous state .",
    "however , the large fractional variability of 0.3 - 0.4 is only seen above 10  kev in bhbs in this state , where the tail dominates over the constant disc component ( see the energy - dependent rms spectra in gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) . scaling this energy for the difference in mass from @xmath21 to @xmath22",
    "gives a prediction that the tail should start to dominate above 4.5 - 6  kev , at significantly higher energies than seen in ngc 5408 x-1 , where the variable tail dominates above 2  kev .",
    "thus , ngc 5408 x-1 does not look convincingly similar to any of the sub - eddington bhb states .",
    "instead , the large implied emission radius of the soft thermal component can also be incorporated into the super - eddington flow models by identifying this not with the disc itself but with much more extended emission from the photosphere of a wind ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; begelman et al .",
    "2006 ; poutanen et al .",
    "similarly , the extreme variability associated with the tail can be matched by occasional states of the pathologically variable bhb , grs 1915 + 105 , where it is probably associated with instabilities in a super - eddington flow ( belloni et al . 1997 ) .",
    "fig 7 ( left hand panel ) shows the power spectrum of the tail in ngc 5408 x-1 ( 1 - 8  kev ) compared to that of _ rxte _ data from @xmath23 and @xmath24 variability states of grs 1915 + 105 ( centre panel , obsids 20405 - 01 - 33 - 00 : belloni et al .",
    "these are calculated using standard 1 data ( 0.125 s resolution ) which has no energy information , but the source spectrum in the _ rxte _ bandpass means that the counts are concentrated in the 3 - 10  kev energy range . as well as showing similarly extreme amounts of broad band noise ,",
    "these also show small milli - hertz qpo features at similarly low frequencies as seen in ngc 5408 x-1 ( 0.01  hz for 33 ) .",
    "these ultra - low frequency qpos can dominate the power spectrum of grs 1915 + 105 in other states where there is much less broad band variability ( obsid : 10408 - 01 - 05 - 00 shown in magenta in the same panel ) , but this is unlike ngc 5408 x-1 , where the qpos are weak and the broadband variability is strong .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that stellar remnant black holes can produce ultra - lfqpos as well as the standard type c lfqpos .",
    "however , while the variability properties of ngc 5408 x-1 and some states of grs 1915 + 105 are very similar , the energy spectra are subtly different .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 state observations of grs 1915 + 105 have spectra which can be well modelled by a disc plus low temperature , optically thick comptonisation ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ; done , wardziski & gierliski 2004 ; ueda et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) , but _",
    "unlike _ ngc 5408 x-1 , the comptonisation component dominates the bolometric luminosity , rather than the thermal component ( see fig .",
    "2 , compared to middleton & done 2010 ) .",
    "thus , even the most super - eddington bhb is not really a good match to the spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "the only known systems which show a similar combination of steep spectral tail and extreme variability are a small subset of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( leighly 1999 ; oneill et al .",
    "these are likely to be super - eddington sources , but there are large uncertainties in deriving mass and mass accretion rate for these sources ( grupe & mathur 2004 ; marconi et al .",
    "fig 7 ( right hand panel ) shows the power spectrum from _ xmm - newton _ data ( obsid 0110890101 ) of the most extremely variable nls1 , iras 13224 - 3809 ( boller et al .",
    "1997 ; gallo et al . 2004",
    "; ponti et al .",
    "since any soft thermal component in the agn should be at much lower energies , we use the full bandpass from 0.3 - 10  kev .",
    "clearly the peak in @xmath25 reaches similar values , though the frequencies are very different .    since ngc",
    "5408 x-1 does not match with any of the sub - eddington bhb states , nor to any of the multiple states of the mildly super - eddington bhb grs 1915 + 105 , it seems most likely that it represents a strongly super - eddington source .",
    "such flows power a strong wind , where the wind photosphere gives the large radius , luminous , soft thermal component at low energies ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; begelman et al . 2006 ; poutanen et al .",
    "this extended emission will be constant on short timescales .",
    "we also see a much more variable tail , so the optically thick wind can not cover all lines of sight to the inner disc . a reasonable geometry for this is an equatorial disc wind ( abolmasov , karpov & kotani 2009 ; ohsuga et al . 2007 , 2009 ) .    the low temperature , optically thick compton emission could be produced by a corona over the inner disc , a more extreme version of the marginally optically thick corona seen in the steep power - law state ( e.g. done & kubota 2006 ; g09 )",
    ". however , it could also be the spectrum of the inner disc itself as at such high mass accretion rate , the high disc temperature means that there is very little true continuum opacity ( beloborodov 1998 , done & davis 2008 ) .",
    "this means that the energy does not thermalise , and can not even be well approximated by a colour temperature corrected blackbody ( see e.g. watarai et al .",
    "we favour this latter origin as the probably super - eddington agn re j1034 + 396 shows clear evidence for a _ separate _ , variable corona , as well as a more constant low temperature comptonised component ( the energy shift from the much larger black hole mass means that any wind photosphere emission is at too low an energy to be observed ) .",
    "this predicts there should also be an additional weak tail in the ulx , which is so far unobserved .",
    "while the small size scale of the inner disc means that it could vary intrinsically , we note that other ulxs with similar spectra do not show similarly extreme variability ( heil et al .",
    "2009 , spectra from g09 ) . instead",
    ", a solution which can explain the range of variability behaviour in these wind - dominated ulxs could be if the extreme variability is extrinsic , from clumps in the wind .",
    "numerical simulations show that this wind is turbulent ( ohsuga 2007 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2009 ) , giving strong variability of the comptonisation component from the inner disc on sightlines which intercept the major wind streamlines , but the soft thermal emission will remain mostly constant due to its much larger size scale .    we show a simple cartoon of this model in fig 8 ( see also leighly 2004 ) . at extreme super - eddington mass accretion rates , a large fraction of the accretion energy",
    "is ejected in the wind , making this energetically dominant ( poutanen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the photosphere of the wind ( orange ) is the source of soft thermal emission , while the inner disc ( green ) is the source of the low temperature , optically thick comptonised emission .",
    "we propose that this has only low level intrinsic variability in strongly super - eddington sources , perhaps because the disc structure is stabilised by advection ( abramowicz et al .",
    "thus these sources have very low variability when viewed along a line of sight which does not intercept the wind , while there is strong variability from obscuration of the comptonised emission when viewed through the turbulent wind .",
    "the intrinsically variable , but rather weak corona ( blue ) gives rise to a weak high energy tail , so far not observed in ulxs .",
    "scaling this model up to nls1s could perhaps similarly explain the extreme variability from sources such as iras 13324 - 3809 and 1h0707 - 495 from absorption in strong winds ( gallo 2004 , see also miller et al .",
    "2010 for how this can also match the spectrum ) , the existence of which are supported by uv emission lines ( leighly 2004 ) . the much lower variability seen from the low temperature comptonised component in re j1034 + 396",
    "is then associated with a more face - on viewing angle .",
    "where timing characteristics scale with mass , they can be used to determine the unknown mass of the black hole in ulx .",
    "however , the wide variety of properties seen in bhb means that this only works if the correct spectral state is identified for scaling .",
    "the key issue in ulxs is whether they are analogous to any of the classic , sub - eddington , bhb states .",
    "if so , the large luminosities of these systems implies an imbh . instead , if ulxs are super - eddington , then there are no well defined templates from bhb except for the unique source grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the suggested identification of the qpo in ngc 5408 x-1 is with the type c lfqpo seen in bhbs .",
    "however , bhbs show a tight correlation between this qpo frequency and that of the low frequency break in the broad band power spectrum ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "we use extensive numerical simulations to constrain the position of this break in the two observations of ngc 5408 x-1 , and find that they are inconsistent with the predicted frequencies from a type c lfqpo .",
    "the energy spectra of both observations of ngc 5408 x-1 are best described by a soft thermal component ( disc or photosphere ) together with a low temperature , optically thick , thermal compton component , as proposed for other high quality ulx spectra ( g09 ) .",
    "the rms spectra show that the variability increases strongly with energy , consistent with a constant soft component which dilutes a separate , strongly variable component at higher energies .",
    "the amount of variability in the high energy component is extreme , and we speculate that this is extrinsic , from stochastic obscuration by the turbulent wind .",
    "the only objects with comparable variability and spectra are grs 1915 + 105 and some extreme nls1s , both of which are most probably super - eddington accretors .",
    "this also suggests an alternative identification for the qpo in ngc 5408 x-1 as being more closely related to the ultra low frequency qpo seen occasionally in grs 1915 + 105 . both spectra and timing are then consistent with identifying ngc 5408 x-1 as a super - eddington source .",
    "this places a natural upper limit on the central bh mass of @xmath26 100m@xmath1 , consistent with a bh formed from stellar collapse in a low metallicity environment ( e.g. belczynski et al .",
