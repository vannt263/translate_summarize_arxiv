    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , or x - ray novae , are a sub - class of low mass x - ray binaries which contain a neutron star or a black hole primary accreting matter from the companion donor star via roche lobe overflow .",
    "sxts spend most of their lifetime in the quiescent state , and occasionally undergo dramatic outbursts which could last from weeks to months , and in some special cases , the outburst can go on for years ( e.g. grs 1915 + 105 ) .",
    "the typical maximum outburst x - ray luminosity of such systems ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 , while the minimum luminosity can go as low as a few times of @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 . however , the true quiescent luminosities ( defined as the luminosities when no accretion onto the black hole occurs ) are unclear due to the insufficient sensitivity of current instruments",
    ".    there are several theoretical attempts to explain the weak x - ray emission from x - ray binaries during their quiescent phase ( see narayan et al .",
    "2001 for a review and references therein ) .",
    "the most widely used idea is perhaps through the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 , narayan & mcclintock 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "the thermal energy that is created by the mass transfer is stored in the adaf flowing towards the center of the compact object instead of being radiated away efficiently as it is at higher accretion rate ( a thin disk is thought to be present in this case ) .",
    "depending on the nature of the central compact objects , different quiescent luminosities are expected . in the case of a neutron star with a solid surface ,",
    "the energy stored in the adaf may impact onto the neutron star surface and be reradiated away . in the case of a black hole ,",
    "no solid surface is present but an event horizon . a large fraction of the energy carried by the gas in the adaf is then transported beyond the event horizon when the gas falls into the black hole before this energy could be emitted .",
    "the consequence of this scenario is that we expect to observe the quiescent luminosity of a black hole to be much fainter than a quiescent neutron star . with the sensitivity of current x - ray observatories ( i.e. chandra , xmm - newton ) , we are able to observe this discrepancy and this provides strong evidence of the existence of the black hole event horizon ( see narayan & mcclintock 2008 for a review and references therein ) . in addition , there is also evidence showing that part of the energy could be dissipated as outflows moving away from the system resulting in low observed x - ray luminosities ( fender et al .",

    "h  1705250 ( also nova ophiuchi 1977 , v2107 oph ) was discovered independently by both the heao-1 scanning modulation collimator and the ariel 5 all sky monitor in september 1977 ( griffiths et al .",
    "1978 ; kaluziensku & holt 1977 ) , and subsequently found to be associated with a bright 16.5 mag optical nova from observations taken at the anglo - australian telescope and uk schmidt telescope(longmore et al .",
    "1997 ; griffiths et al .",
    "1978 ) . a maximum x - ray flux ( 2 - 18 kev ) of @xmath03.5 crab followed by a slow decline in the lightcurve was reported by watson et al . ( 1978 ) .",
    "griffiths et al .",
    "( 1978 ) also noted a dim object ( at b@xmath021 ) near the nova position on palomar sky survey plates , which later was confirmed as the companion star ( a k dwarf star with mass 0.3 - 0.6 @xmath6 ) of the binary system .",
    "h  1705250 has a confirmed dynamical measurement for the mass of its black hole in a range of 5.6 - 8.3 @xmath6 ( remillard & mcclintock , 2006 ) , and it was not observed with any high sensitivity x - ray instrument prior our proposed chandra observation .",
    "this is the first deep x - ray observation to measure the quiescent luminosity of this source .",
    "the last x - ray observation was taken with rosat and an upper limit of @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 ( assuming a distance of 8.6 kpc ) was placed ( narayan et al .",
    "our 50 ks chandra observation has improved the sensitivity by a factor of @xmath01000 .    in this paper , we present results of the x - ray observation and new optical monitoring data of h  1705250 in quiescence .",
    "we also derive a more accurate source position which allows us to estimate the quiescent luminosity of the source more precisely .",
    "h  1705250 was observed with chandra on 2010 - 05 - 02 ut 23:43:29 for a total duration of about 50 ks ( pi : kong , obsid:11041 ) .",
    "the observation was carried out with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) operating in the very faint mode , and the target was placed on a back - illuminated acis chip ( s3 ) . in additional to our x - ray observation ,",
    "h  1705250 has been monitored with the 2 m faulkes telescope north since 2006 .",
    "most of the data were obtained using the sdss @xmath8-band filter , and a few in bessel v , r and pan - starrs y filters .",
    "the only solid detections of the sxt ( @xmath9 ) were made in @xmath8-band .",
    "for the first examination of our chandra data , we adopted the coordinates obtained from ned and simbad ( based on griffiths 1978 optical nova position ) , which is inconsistent with the coordinates reported in remillard et al .",
    "1996 . within a 2@xmath10 extraction radius ,",
    "there are 2 counts found at the griffiths position , but no count at the remillard position .",
    "however , we noticed a photon excess in between these two reported positions .",
    "we speculated that this might be the true position of h  1705250 , and a new astrometry correction for the position is necessary .",
    "we obtained a 200 s @xmath8-band image from the faulkes telescope north in 2010 ( see section 2.3 ) , which was taken under excellent seeing conditions and the quiescent optical counterpart of the source is clearly detected .",
    "we tied the faulkes image s world coordinate system ( wcs ) with the 2mass point source catalog by using ccmap task in iraf .",
    "the task results in extremely small registration errors ( 0.064@xmath10 for ra , and 0.072@xmath10 for dec ) .",
    "this provides us with good accuracy to determine the position of h  1705250 .",
    "the coordinates ( j2000 ) we obtained are ra = 17:08:14.515 , and dec = -25:05:30.15 .",
    "the typical precision of 2mass point source astrometry is @xmath11 with respect to tycho-2 reference system .",
    "we therefore use 0.2@xmath10 as our systematic position error .    to compare with the optical position",
    ", we also astrometrically corrected our chandra image .",
    "we selected several nearby bright x - ray sources in which their positions were determined by using the task celldetect in standard chandra interactive analysis observation ( ciao ) package .",
    "we then compared the positions of these x - ray sources with their 2mass counterparts , and updated the world coordinate system of our chandra image . to check the consistency of the chandra position of h  1705250 with the optical position , we tried to detect the source using celldetect. because the source is very faint , we reset the default value of the parameter thresh to 1 ( the default setting is 3 ) .",
    "we detected the source at position ra = 17:08:14.525 , and dec = -25:05:30.46 with errors 1.01@xmath10 and 0.51@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the chandra position found by celldetect matches the optical counterpart position very well , and we can clearly see photons clustering at the overlapped region ( see fig . 1 for more detail ) .",
    "we analyzed our chandra data by using ciao package version 4.3 . in order to apply the most updated calibrations , we first ran the chandra reprocessing script to create a new level 2 event file .",
    "the new level 2 event file was then used throughout the whole analysis . to reduce the background contamination and the calibration uncertainties , we extracted an energy filtered event list in the 0.3 - 7 kev energy band using the task dmcopy. we created a source region file by selecting a circle with a radius 1.5@xmath10 centered at the new source position ( derived from faulkes data ) , as well as a background region file with much larger radius ( 10@xmath10 ) at a source free region near h  1705250 .",
    "we then ran the task dmextract to obtain background subtracted source count rate .",
    "an alternative method utilizing built - in library funtool in ds9 was also performed to confirm the results by ciao dmextract. there were 5 photons found within the 1.5@xmath10 source region , and the average background within 10@xmath10 is around 0.304 counts . with 5 detected events ,",
    "the poisson distribution gives 95@xmath12 confidence intervals from 1.6 to 11.7 counts .",
    "we calculated the poisson probability of getting 5 photons at a random position to be @xmath13 , making the 5 photons detection significant . because only a small number of photons were detected , we were not able to construct a spectrum for spectral analysis .",
    "the webpimms was used to estimate the source flux by inputting the count rate obtained from ciao , the galactic column density @xmath14=@xmath15 @xmath16 along the line of sight towards the source position ( dicky & lockman , 1990 ) , and assuming a power - law photon index @xmath17 ( a typical value for most of the black hole binaries in quiescent state , e.g. kong et al .",
    "we obtained a flux of @xmath18 erg @xmath16 s@xmath2 in the 0.5 - 10 kev energy band . assuming a distance of @xmath19 kpc ( barret et al .",
    "1996 , jonker & nelemans , 2004 ) , we estimated the minimum luminosity of h  1705250 to be @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 . since the distance uncertainty contribute the major errors , we estimated the lower and upper bound of the luminosity to be @xmath21 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath22 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "h  1705250 has been monitored since 2006 with the 2-m faulkes telescope north , located at haleakala on maui , as part of an ongoing monitoring campaign of @xmath23 low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "122 images of the source were taken between february 2006 and may 2012 , on a total of 78 dates .",
    "exposure times were 200 s and the pixel scale was 0.278 arcsec pixel@xmath2 .",
    "bias subtraction and flat - fielding were performed via automatic pipelines .",
    "photometry was performed on h  1705250 and five field stars using phot in iraf .",
    "the source was detected on 31 out of 78 dates with signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath24 , all in the @xmath8-band filter .",
    "images in which s / n @xmath25 were discarded because the field star magnitudes were varying by @xmath26 mag , and images in which the seeing was @xmath27 arcsec were also removed due to the contamination of nearby stars to the aperture in this crowded field in the galactic plane .",
    "the relative magnitudes were flux calibrated using landolt standard stars observed in @xmath8-band on three dates in which the seeing was @xmath28 arcsec and the airmass of h  1705250 was @xmath29 .",
    "five stars in the standard star field sa 110 were used on 2010 - 04 - 10 and 2011 - 07 - 16 , and four stars in the field mark a were used on 2010 - 07 - 09 .",
    "all standards were taken within 4 hr of h  1705250 and at a similar airmass ( @xmath30 difference ) on each date .",
    "the sdss @xmath8-band magnitudes of the standard stars were calculated from their known @xmath31- and @xmath32-band magnitudes using the transformations of @xcite .",
    "taking into account airmass - dependent atmospheric extinction , we calculated the magnitudes of three isolated stars of magnitudes @xmath33 to 20.0 within 20 arcsec of h  1705250 in order to calibrate our images .",
    "on the three dates , the derived magnitude of each star agreed within @xmath34 to 0.06 mag ( the agreement was better for the brighter stars ) , confirming that the conditions were photometric on all three nights .",
    "we then used the brighter two of these three stars to perform relative photometry on h  1705250 and two further faint field stars of similar magnitude to the sxt , which we designate star c and star 4 .",
    "star c is shown in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "we estimate the systematic error on the resulting magnitudes to be small ; 0.03 mag .",
    "the magnitude errors are dominated by the low s / n of the sxt and faint field stars . in fig .",
    "2 we present the long - term faulkes light curve of h  1705250 and these two field stars of similar magnitude , spanning from 2006 to present .",
    "the mean magnitude of h  1705250 , when detected significantly , was @xmath35 .",
    "mean quiescent apparent magnitudes in other filters measured at earlier epochs after outburst were @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( martin et al .",
    "1995 ; remillard et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the long - term optical quiescent variability of the sxt appears to be of higher amplitude than the two field stars ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which may be indicative of the modulation of the companion star or of accretion activity in quiescence , as seen in some other quiescent sxts from optical or x - ray light curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "flares on timescales of seconds to hours are often seen at optical wavelengths , indicating the presence of accretion activity even at these lowest luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section 3 ) .",
    "the variability properties of the sxt and the two stars are given in table 1 .",
    "on two dates during 2007 , h  1705250 is visibly fainter than the mean by @xmath38 mag ( dips ) , and it is brighter in the last two images with detections .",
    "the two dips and the brighter epoch at the end are probably real as they are @xmath39 away from the mean magnitude ( the rms scatter in the magnitude of star 4 is used as @xmath40 , since we assume this star to be intrinsically unvarying ) .",
    "the magnitude of h  1705250 spans 0.9 mag , whereas the field stars span 0.3 mag .",
    "this implies the variability in h  1705250 is intrinsic to the source .",
    "remillard et al . ( 1996 ) found an orbital periodic modulation in their @xmath41-band quiescent light curve , of full amplitude @xmath42 mag and the folded light curve showed brief dips below the mean ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely then , that the two dips in our @xmath8-band light curve are due to the same periodic modulation .",
    "the recent flux increase is harder to explain by the modulation ; this may represent low - level accretion activity , as seen in other sources .",
    "we also folded the data on the known orbital period of @xmath43 d ( remillard et al . 1996 ) , and no phase - dependent variability is seen . over the 6.3 years of observations , using the above period , the source will have performed @xmath44 orbits during this time . since the uncertainty is 11 periods , we can not fold the light curve on the period and obtain meaningful results .",
    ".optical variability properties of h  1705250 and two field stars of similar magnitude .",
    "all values are given in @xmath8-band magnitudes . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have observed the black hole transient h  1705250 during its quiescent state with chandra . the 50 ks long exposure reveals 5 photons at the source position ( within 1.5@xmath10 radius ) , yielding a source luminosity of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( in 0.5 - 10 kev ) when assuming a distance of 8.6 kpc .",
    "this improves the quiescent sensitivity of the source by a factor of @xmath45 compared to the previous reported rosat value . in the context of the adaf models , the quiescent luminosities depend on the orbital period of the system .",
    "the very low luminosity of h1705 - 250 together with its orbital period ( @xmath46 days ) thus consistent with this framework .",
    "we have also examined the optical monitoring data of h  1705250 obtained by the faulkes telescope north , refined the best position of the source and obtained a long - term lightcurve .",
    "it has been observed that the quiescent x - ray luminosity of black hole binaries are usually very dim ( e.g. garcia et al .",
    "2001 ; kong et al .",
    "they are @xmath0100 times fainter than neutron stars with similar orbital periods .",
    "it is unclear why the x - ray luminosity is much dimmer for black hole systems compared with the neutron star systems apart from the reason of a difference between a solid surface and an event horizon .",
    "the emission may originate from a truncated accretion disc that is detached from the central advective flow , or perhaps from the jet or outflow launched during quiescence or perhaps it is a combination for both disc and jet components .",
    "several theoretical studies have attempted to explain the origin of the weak x - ray emission in the quiescent state of black hole binaries , yet none of the models can fully satisfy the observed properties .",
    "the adaf is by far the most used scenario ( as described in the introduction section ) .",
    "however , it has recently been realized that the jet / outflow can also play an important role in carrying away some fraction of the accretion energy from black holes in quiescence ( gallo et al .",
    "2006 ) , possibly resulting in weaker emissions comparing to emissions from neutron star systems . the true picture might fall in between the two scenarios ( adaf + outflows ) . due to this",
    ", some theoretical models have evolved into more complicated forms to incorporate both disk and jet ( or wind ) properties ( blandford and begelman 1999 , yuan et al .",
    "it is still a work in progress since most of the models are only able to explain some sources but not all .",
    "in addition , how do we know what we observed is the true quiescent state of the black hole ?",
    "due to current sensitivities of x - ray instruments , we are not able to observe most of the very faint black hole systems in detail and resolve their spectral properties in quiescence . however , several quiescent optical studies have revealed evidence for strong optical activities in quiescent lightcurves of several black hole systems ( zurita et al .",
    "2003 , casares et al .",
    "2009 , shahbaz et al . 2010 ) .",
    "most of these systems show short - term variability or flares superimposed on the weak ellipsoidal modulation of companion star , and sometimes show long - term aperiodic variability or magnitude color changes implying optical state changes ( cantrell et al .",
    "2008 ) .    from our 6 years",
    "long - term optical lightcurve , we observed two dips and an increasing brightness of the source since the end of 2011 , indicating that the source is still active even at this very low rate of accretion .",
    "the origin of this variability is not yet fully understood , but it is probably associated with the accretion disc .",
    "there are several possible explanations : it could be due to the x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disc ( kong et al .",
    "2001 , hynes et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) , magnetic reconnection events ( zurita et al . 2003 ) , or the emission from the adaf ( shahbaz et al .",
    "2003 , 2010 ) .",
    "unfortunately , our optical data are not sufficiently sensitive for such detailed analysis .",
    "future observations are needed for further investigation .",
    "in addition , the next generation x - ray observatory with improved sensitivity will certainly bring us new insights and shed light on understanding accretion physics of binary systems in very low accretion regimes .",
