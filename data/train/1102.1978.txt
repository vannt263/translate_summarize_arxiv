    "the gaseous clouds surrounding the milky way are observed at near - zero velocity , as well as in intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) and high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "the latter are defined as interstellar gas with absolute velocities relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) between @xmath9  and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these clouds are inconsistent with the simple model of galactic rotation ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the ivcs and hvcs are detected not only in neutral and mildly ionized species like , , , , and  ( @xcite ) but also in highly ionized species like , , , and  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ivcs have near - solar metal abundances , are found within several kpc of the galactic plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are consistent with the galactic fountain interpretation .",
    "however , the origin of hvcs is still poorly understood .",
    "the proposed scenarios include the galactic fountain @xcite , cooling galactic halo gas falling onto the galactic plane @xcite , warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) in the local group @xcite , and combinations of all three ( @xcite ) .",
    "these competing models predict distinct scale sizes and metallicities of hvcs , ranging from several kpc with near - solar abundances ( fountain model ) , to tens of kpc with subsolar abundances ( halo model ) , to hundreds of kpc with primordial abundances ( the whim model ) .",

    "@xcite made further differential optical observations of stars in the region and revised the distance ( @xmath20 kpc ) to .",
    "they argued that the absence of high - velocity absorption along the hd  93521 sight line could be due to small - scale spatial variation of the complex , and suggested decreasing the lower limit to its distance .",

    "this method is equivalent to a curve - of - growth analysis but propagates errors automatically .",

    "since we have well - determined values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 from 21 cm data (   [ sec : obs ] ) , we fix its absorption in the total  spectrum and fit the remaining absorption as the hvc contribution . the deuterium ( ) absorption lines lie @xmath74 blueward of the corresponding  lines .",
    "thus ,  in the ivc lies at @xmath75 and gives a small amount of contamination to the hvc  absorption at @xmath70  .",
    "we model the  absorption by adopting the abundance in the local ism , ( d / h ) = @xmath76 @xcite and assuming that thermal broadening dominates its line width , @xmath77 . to minimize the uncertainties caused by line saturation , we only use blue - rising wings of five high - order transitions of , from ly@xmath78 to ly@xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mrkb ] ) .",
    "we jointly fit these five  lines to reduce statistical uncertainties , allowing their positions to vary by @xmath80  km  s@xmath81 around the expected hvc velocity to account for possible systematic wavelength drift . in the joint fit",

    "the mrk  421 sight line probes an interesting region of hvc complex m. it lies approximately @xmath86 away from the mi , mii , and miii clouds and passes through the ivc iv26 ( fig .  [ fig : map ] ; see also fig .  1 in @xcite and fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "an apparent ( lsr ) velocity change from @xmath87   at @xmath88 to @xmath89   at @xmath90 was observed in previous studies of mi @xcite .",
    "the detected velocity ( @xmath91 ) along the mrk  421 sight line is inconsistent with this trend , but it fits into a larger scale ( @xmath92 ) picture in which the velocities of mi increase toward higher longitudes and lower latitudes , connecting with miii whose velocities increase toward lower longitudes and higher latitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ; also see fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the sight line likely probes the high velocity end of complex  m.    the hvc along the mrk  421 sight line has been suggested in , , and  absorption lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum . @xcite measured a surprisingly large value , @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) in a component fit to the saturated  lyman lines ly@xmath95ly@xmath96 , nearly 70 times higher than that ( table  [ tab : results ] ) obtained in this work . to examine possible causes of this discrepancy , we superpose the amount of the four velocity components revealed from the green bank observation @xcite on the  absorption spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mrkb]g - i ) .",
    "clearly , only the blue wing of the ivc at @xmath97 affects the @xmath98 determination . to further examine possible effects of beam smearing",
    ", we extracted the lab emission data within @xmath99 around the mrk  421 sight line . unlike the other three emission components , whose brightness temperatures can vary by a factor of five , @xmath73 increases smoothly toward large longitudes and high latitudes , with fluctuations @xmath100 among the four beams closest to the mrk  421 sight line . taking this variation into account in our analysis",
    ", we find that the change in @xmath98 is negligible compared to that caused by the systematic uncertainty of the wavelength calibration .",
    "we conclude that our result is not affected by beam smearing , although we can not completely rule out variations of the ivc absorption on angular scales @xmath101 arcmin , which could significantly change our results .",
    "we speculate that the apparently large @xmath98 obtained by savage et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is caused by the severely underestimated @xmath73 in their fit .",
    "the measured @xmath102 and @xmath98 give a metallicity in the hvc along the mrk  421 sight line of [ o / h]@xmath103 or 0.853.5  @xmath23 .",
    "the large uncertainty is caused by systematic uncertainty in the wavelength calibration introduced in our joint analysis of the  lyman series (   [ sec : results ] ) . because  and  have nearly the same ionization potential and are coupled by resonant charge exchange , this measurement accurately reflects the gas - phase oxygen abundance and is not subject to ionization correction . in measuring @xmath98",
    ", we assumed @xmath104 and @xmath82 and adopted the local - ism deuterium abundance , ( d / h ) = @xmath76 , one of the lowest interstellar abundances ( @xcite ) . adopting higher values of for d / h or @xmath105 will result in a smaller @xmath98 .",
    "therefore the inferred oxygen abundance should be regarded as a conservative lower limit .",
    "ionization corrections need to be applied in calculating the abundances of si , s , or fe . for a photoionized plasma with hydrogen number density @xmath106 and @xmath107 ,",
    "the ( logarithmic ) ionization corrections are 1.30 , 1.42 , and 0.90 for , , and , respectively ( mark giroux , private communication , 2010 ) . taking the best - fit values ( table  [ tab : results ] ) , we obtain [ x / h]@xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for si , s , and fe .",
    "owing to the unconstrained @xmath111 , the systematic uncertainty could be high in the inferred [ si / h ] , [ s / h ] , and [ fe / h ] . however , this exercise results in consistently high metal abundances , except for a slightly lower value for si . within uncertainties ,",
    "the high metallicity is consistent with values 0.41.8",
    "@xmath23 in mi @xcite , @xmath112 in miii @xcite , and the near - solar metallicity of iv3 @xcite .",
    "the consistency also suggests that the hvc toward mrk  421 is associated with complex m and the lower velocity iv arch .",
    "the measured oxygen abundance provides a new lower limit to the metallicity of complex m.    the high metallicity , together with the upper limit on distance of other parts of complex m , shed light on its origin .",
    "unlike the highly ionized hvcs , in which the high ions (  and ) are significant or even dominant , the hvc toward mrk  421 is dominated by low ions ( , , ; table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "this suggests distinct ionization conditions of this hvc compared to the highly ionized , low  column density hvcs ( @xcite ) .",
    "such mildly ionized , low  column density hvcs have recently been surveyed by several groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "richter et al . ( 2009 ) also provided ionization modeling for the hvcs with different distances . substituting @xmath102 and @xmath113 ( table  [ tab : results ] ) into their model and assuming no depletion of si into dust grains , we obtain a gas density @xmath114 and absorption path length @xmath115 pc for complex m. the near - solar ( likely supersolar ) abundance , short path length , and large gas density clearly rule out the whim model and disfavor the halo model (   [ sec : intro ] ) for the hvc .",
    "complex m likely traces a supernova shell that has not been ejected too far above the galactic plane and is now falling back to the galactic disk .    in summary , we have presented an interstellar high velocity cloud detected in ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of mrk  421 , which represents the highest velocity end of the hvc complex m. the combination of _ hst_-cos and _ fuse _ observations enables us to obtain a lower limit , @xmath116 , to the metallicity of the complex .",
    "the high metallicity and the short distance are consistent with complex m being the returning gas of a galactic fountain .",
