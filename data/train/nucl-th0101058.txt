    "the action for any local quantum field theory is invariant under the transformation generated by the antiunitary operator cpt , which is the product of the inversions : c - charge conjugation ; p - parity transformation ; and t - time reversal .",
    "the combined cpt transformation provides a rigorous correspondence between particles and antiparticles , and it relates the @xmath5-matrix for any given process to its inverse process , where all the spins are flipped and the particles replaced by their antiparticles .",
    "lorentz and cpt symmetry together have many consequences , among them , that the mass and total width of any particle are identical to those of its antiparticle .",
    "the decay of the cp - odd eigenstate @xmath6 into a cp - even @xmath7 final state demonstrates that the product of only c and p is not a good symmetry of the standard model .",
    "this entails that time reversal invariance must also be violated and that too has been observed in detailed studies of the neutral kaon system  @xcite .",
    "the separate violation of cp and t invariance can be accommodated in the six - quark - flavour standard model : only five of the six possible phases in the @xmath8 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix can be eliminated via phase rotations of the quark flavours  rotating all the quarks through the same phase can not affect the ckm matrix  leaving one cp violating phase .",
    "( in the four flavour theory , by contrast , the @xmath9 ckm matrix has three possible phases , all of which can be eliminated . ) however , some aspects of the standard model are not completely satisfactory , notably the understanding of the magnitude of the direct cp violating parameter @xmath10  @xcite .    identifying phenomena that are inexplicable in the standard model is an important focus of contemporary nuclear and particle physics , and while the neutral kaon system is the archetype for cp and t violation , the standard ckm model predicts much larger effects for @xmath11-mesons  @xcite . a primary goal of the @xmath11-factories now being developed is to check these predictions .",
    "this is a new domain for testing the standard model .",
    "however , it has long been known that the possession of an electric dipole moment ( edm ) by a spin @xmath12 particle would signal the violation of time - reversal invariance .",
    "( the existence of a dipole moment signals a spherically asymmetric distribution of charge . )",
    "any such effect is likely small , given the observed magnitude of cp and t violation in the neutral kaon system , and this makes neutral particles the obvious subject for experiments : the existence of an electric monopole charge would overwhelm most signals of the dipole strength .",
    "it is therefore natural to focus on the neutron , which is the simplest spin-@xmath12 neutral system in nature , and attempts to measure the neutron s edm have a long history  @xcite .",
    "very accurate measurements are made possible by the ability to produce and store ultracold ( @xmath13ev ) polarised neutrons .",
    "immersing such a sample in uniform magnetic and electric fields , the existence of a nonzero neutron edm , @xmath14 , manifests itself through a difference between the precession frequency of the neutron s spin when the magnetic and electric fields are parallel as compared to when they are antiparallel .",
    "contemporary applications  @xcite of this technique yield an upper bound @xmath15 .",

    "equation  ( [ dnub ] ) has proven to be an effective constraint .",
    "for example , the most general lagrangian density for a local , renormalisable colour-@xmath20 gauge theory would contain a term : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the non - abelian field strength tensor and @xmath23 is an undetermined constant - the `` @xmath23 angle . ''",
    "however , this term violates cp invariance and hence generates a nonzero neutron edm .",
    "its strength ; i.e. , the value of @xmath23 , is therefore constrained by eq .",
    "( [ dnub ] ) , which yields a very low upper bound  @xcite @xmath24 currently there is no satisfactory explanation of why this term is so strongly suppressed and that is the basis of the so - called `` strong cp problem : '' the goal is to find a reason why @xmath23 should _ naturally _ be identically zero .",
    "( in the absence of topologically nontrivial gauge field configurations , eq .  ( [ thetaterm ] ) can not contribute to the action : it is a surface term . )    herein we shall assume @xmath25 so that the phase in the ckm matrix is the only source of cp and t violation in the standard model . in this case",
    "a nonzero neutron edm is proportional to the ckm phase .",
    "( considerations relevant for @xmath26 are explored , e.g. , in refs.@xcite . )    over many years the experimental upper bound on @xmath0 has steadily decreased and its small value has also proven very effective in ruling out candidates for theories that enlarge the standard model . to illustrate how , we suppose for the moment that the neutron is a collection of three valence - quarks described by a symmetric @xmath27 spin - flavour wave function",
    ". then , by analogy with the magnetic moment , @xmath28 where @xmath29 are valence - quark edms . in the standard model the first nonzero contribution to a free quark s edm appears at third order and involves a gluon radiative correction ( i.e. , o@xmath30 , for the same reason that flavour - changing neutral currents are suppressed : the gim mechanism ) so that  @xcite @xmath31 using this in eq .",
    "( [ dncqm ] ) gives a result _ seven _ orders - of - magnitude less than the current experimental bound .",
    "this result is characteristic : other plausible mechanisms within the standard model , such as hadronic loop corrections , also give a very small value .",
