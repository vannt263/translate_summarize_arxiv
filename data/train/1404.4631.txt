    "one of the biggest challenges of modern @xmath2-ray astronomy and one of the main scientific objectives of the ongoing _ fermi _ mission is unraveling the nature of the unidentified gamma - ray sources ( ugss ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the third egret catalog ( 3eg ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the fraction of @xmath2-ray sources without an assigned counterpart at low energies has been significant @xmath0% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this situation was mostly unchanged in the revised egret catalog , even though the improved background modeling applied in the egr resulted in fewer @xmath2-ray detections ( 188 sources in total , in contrast to 271 listed in 3eg ) ; 87 out of 188 egr entries remain unassociated .",
    "the ugss at low galactic latitude ( @xmath3 ) are expected to be associated with local objects lying in our galaxy , such as molecular clouds ( as consequence of interaction with cosmic - rays ) , supernova remnants , massive stars , pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae , or x - ray binaries although there are few rare cases of @xmath2-ray blazars detected through the galactic plane ( e.g. fermi j0109 + 6134 , see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the population of ugss above the galactic plane is generally believed to be dominated by extragalactic sources , although there is a suspected galactic component as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to one of the most recent _ fermi _ discoveries , several millisecond pulsars have been found at high galactic latitudes @xcite .",

    "their observational properties are generally interpreted in terms of a relativistic jet aligned within a small angle to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the blazar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) typically show two peaks . the first one , lying in the range of radio - soft x - rays , is widely held to be due to synchrotron emission by highly relativistic electrons within their jet",
    ". the second one lies at hard x - ray or @xmath2-ray energies , and is interpreted as inverse compton upscattering by the same electrons of the seed photons provided by the synchrotron emission @xcite with the possible addition of seed photons from outside the jets yielding contributions to the non - thermal radiations due to external inverse compton scattering ( see * ? ? ?",

    "however , due to the incompleteness of the current radio and x - ray surveys used for the gamma - ray associations , it is not always possible to identify a blazar - like counterpart to a ugs - ray source as  candidate counterpart \" , while we will use the term  blazar candidate \" for the @xmath2-ray source together with its unique blazar - like counterpart . ] .",

    "wise data also proven to be useful to address the widely entertained field of mid - infrared agn selection ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",

    "we then apply the kernel density estimation ( kde ) technique to compare their ir colors to those of known @xmath2-ray blazars , selecting 44 new blazar - like candidate counterparts and 6 @xmath2-ray blazars candidates as a result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : sample ] is devoted to the ugs sample definition while section [ sec : swift ] describes the main data reduction procedure adopted for the _ swift _ xrt and _ swift _ uvot observations .",
    "the complete list of x - ray sources that could be potential counterpart of ugss in the 2fgl catalog is presented in section [ sec : ugs ] . in section [ sec : kde ] we illustrate our selection of new @xmath2-ray blazar candidates . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare our results with different , previous selections , and section [ sec : summary ] is dedicated to our conclusions .",
    "the initial sample considered in our analysis is constituted by the 299 ugss in the 2fgl catalog that do not present any @xmath2-ray analysis flag @xcite .    up to march 31 , 2013 , 205 of these sources feature at least one x - ray observation in the _ swift _ master catalog performed in photon counting ( pc ) mode , and covering the positional uncertainty region at 95% level of confidence as reported in the 2fgl . the final sample considered in this analysis is therefore constituted by the above selected 205 sources .",
    "the _ swift _ observations have variable exposures , and to detect the fainter x - ray objects we merged all the observations corresponding to each ugss ( see section [ sec : swift ] for details on the reduction procedures ) , obtaining the total exposures shown in figure [ exposures ] .    .",
    "_ swift _ has proven to be an excellent multi - frequency observatory for blazar research , so far observing hundreds of sources and yielding an extremely rich and unique database of multi - frequency ( optical , uv , x - ray ) , simultaneous blazar observations .",
    "several papers on samples selected with different criteria have already been published , including : blazars detected at tev energies , simultaneous optical - to - x - ray observations of flaring tev sources as well as the investigation of low and high frequency peaked bl lacs .",
    "_ swift _ has also been used for uv - optical and x - ray follow - up observations of tev flaring blazars and has also been useful in obtaining photometric redshift constraints for many _ fermi_-detected bl lacs .    once _",
    "fermi _ was launched , the _ swift _ xrt survey of _ fermi _ unassociated sources was started to perform follow - up observations of the ugss in an attempt to find their potential x - ray counterparts ( pi a. falcone ) . in the following sections we analyze all the data collected between the beginning of the follow - up program until march 31 , 2013 , for the selected sample of ugss described in section [ sec : sample ] .    during these observations ,",
    "_ swift _ operated with all its instruments in data taking mode . for our analysis , however , we consider only _ swift _ xrt @xcite and _ swift _ uvot @xcite data .",
    "the xrt data were processed using the xrtdas software @xcite developed at the asi science data center and included in the heasoft package ( v. 6.13 ) distributed by heasarc . for each observation of the sample ,",
    "calibrated and cleaned pc mode event files were produced with the xrtpipeline task ( ver .",
    "0.12.6 ) , producing exposure maps for each observation .",
    "in addition to the screening criteria used by the standard pipeline processing , we applied a further filter to screen background spikes that can occur when the angle between the pointing direction of the satellite and the bright earth limb is low . in order to eliminate this so called bright earth effect , due to the scattered optical light that usually occurs towards the beginning or the end of each orbit",
    ", we used the procedure proposed by and .",
    "we monitored the count rate on the ccd border and , through the xselect package , we excluded time intervals when the count rate in this region exceeded 40 counts / s ; moreover , we selected only time intervals with ccd temperatures less than @xmath7 ( instead of the standard limit of @xmath8 ) since contamination by dark current and hot pixels , which increase the low energy background , is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "we then proceeded to merge cleaned event files obtained with this procedure using xselect , considering only observations with telescope aim point falling in a circular region of 12 radius centered in the median of the individual aim points , in order to have a uniform exposure .",
    "the corresponding merged exposure maps were then generated by summing the exposure maps of the individual observations with ximage ( ver .",
    "4.5.1 ) .      to detect x - ray sources in the merged xrt images ,",
    "we made used of the ximage detection algorithm detect , which locates the point sources using a sliding - cell method .",
    "the average background intensity is estimated in several small square boxes uniformly located within the image .",
    "the position and intensity of each detected source are calculated in a box whose size maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the net counts are corrected for dead times and vignetting using the appropriate exposure maps , and for the fraction of source counts that fall outside the box where the net counts are estimated , using the psf calibration .",
    "count rate statistical and systematic uncertainties are added quadratically .",
    "the algorithm was set to work in bright mode , which is recommended for crowded fields and fields containing bright sources , since it can reconstruct the centroids of very nearby sources .",
    "we also evaluated the net count rates for the detected sources with the sosta algorithm that , besides the net count rates and the respective uncertainties , yields the statistical significance of each source .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in the count rates returned by sosta are purely statistical - i.e. do not include systematic errors - and are in general smaller than those given by detect .",
    "sosta also yields slightly different count rates from detect , which are in most cases more accurate , because detect uses a global background for the entire image , whereas sosta uses a local background .",
    "thus we report both values in our analysis .",
    "the catalog was then cleaned from spurious sources - usually occurring at count rates higher than @xmath9 - by visual inspection of all the observations . finally , we refined the source position and relative positional errors by the task xrtcentroid of the xrtdas package , and considered only sources falling in a circular region of radius equal to the semi - major axis of the ellipse corresponding to the positional uncertainty region of the _ fermi _ source at 95% level of confidence and centered at the 2fgl position of the @xmath2-ray source ( consistently with @xcite ) .",

    "the results of the detection process are presented in appendix [ app : tables ] in table [ table_xrt ] .",
    "we note that 203 out of the 205 ugss that constitute our sample have been also observed in the optical and uv by uvot .",
    "we then produced for each x - ray observation the corresponding merged uvot event files adopting standard procedures .",
    "after checking the correct wcs alignment of our images with usno - b catalog @xcite , we merged them with fappend ( part of ftools package ver . 6.13 ) and then merged the images with uvotimsum ; the same procedure was applied to produce merged exposure maps .    for each x - ray source found with the procedure described in [ sec :",
    "xrt ] , we looked in the corresponding uvot images for uv - optical counterparts falling in the relative xrt positional error .",
    "we performed source photometry using the uvotsource task using the appropriate exposure map .",
    "we adopted an aperture radius of 5  , independently of the image filter , and took the background region in the form of circle with typical radius of 20  in a source - free region of the sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a comparison we also evaluated source photometry with the uvotdetect task , which detects sources in uvot images and extracts their count rates evaluating the background level . in general",

    "for this reason , we performed for each ugs listed in table [ table_xrt ] simulations to evaluate the probability of chance coincidence detections of x - ray sources .    as a first step we evaluated the mean spatial density @xmath11 of x - ray sources detected in the whole _ swift _",
    "xrt field of view and inside the lat positional uncertainty region . in the upper panel of figure [ density ]",
    "we present with red and blue crosses respectively these two densities as a function of the exposure time , while in the lower panel of the same figure we show with black crosses the ratio @xmath12 of these two densities . despite the spread ,",
    "the average values of these quantities evaluated in bins of 1 ks ( indicated with circles of the appropriate color ) show that for exposure times higher than @xmath16 ks the two mean densities become comparable .",
    "the mean spatial densities , however , can not be used to properly evaluate the chance coincidence probability , since they do not take into account the spatial distribution of the x - ray sources , that is not uniform . in order to properly evaluate the chance coincidence probability we adopted a method similar to that presented by @xcite , that consists in randomly shifting the searching region ( in our case , the lat positional uncertainty region ) and",
    "evaluate how many x - ray sources fall into this shifted region .",
    "for each usg listed in table [ table_xrt ] we generated 50 random regions of the same size of the relative lat positional uncertainty region ( and disconnected from the latter ) in order to cover the whole _ swift _",
    "xrt field of view .",
    "we then counted how many of these random regions contain a number of x - ray sources equal or higher than the number of x - ray sources contained inside the lat positional uncertainty region , evaluating for each ugs the relative chance coincidence probability that , as shown in figure [ density ] , depends on the source exposure .",
    "we then evaluated the average chance coincidence probability for all our ugs , that is @xmath17 with a standard deviation of @xmath18 ; we can therefore conservatively evaluate a chance coincidence probability @xmath19 .",
    "this value makes us confident in associating the detected x - ray sources with the ugss .    .",
    "we note that this model assumption induce an error of @xmath20 on the estimated flux . ]",
    "using the procedure described in [ sec : xrt ] , we obtained a catalog of 357 x - ray sources detected with a significance @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we have 195 sources detected with a significance @xmath22 , 111 sources with a significance @xmath23 and 80 sources with a significance @xmath24 .",
    "we found x - ray sources consistent with the locations of 143 ugss , with 51 ugss having a single x - ray source and 92 ugss having multiple x - ray sources in their positional uncertainty region .",
    "the remaining 62 ugss , although overlapping with xrt - pc observations , do not show any x - ray counterpart .    in figure [ exposures_vs_fluxes ]",

    ", we made use of all available observations performed by _ swift _ xrt in pc mode up to march 31 , 2013 , that where available for 205 ugss . in order to detect the fainter sources , we merged all the observations corresponding to each ugss , and applied to these merged observations different detection algorithms ( i.e. , ximage detect and sosta ) .",

    "the methods discussed here to find @xmath2-ray blazar - like sources in ugss uncertainty regions show that this is not always the case .",
