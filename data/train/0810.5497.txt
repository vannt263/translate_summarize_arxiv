    "the objective of the nemo  3 experiment is to search for the double beta decay process with two ( @xmath0 decay ) or zero ( @xmath1 decay ) neutrinos in the final state in the seven different @xmath5 isotopes listed in table  [ tab : t12 ] .",
    "the experimental search for @xmath1 decay is of major importance in particle physics .",
    "if this process is observed then it will reveal the majorana nature of the neutrino ( @xmath6 ) and may allow an access to the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "the process @xmath1 decay also violates the principle of lepton number conservation and is , therefore , a direct probe for physics beyond the standard model . in the case of the neutrino - mass mechanism",
    "the @xmath1 decay rate can be written as @xmath7^{-1 } = \\langle m_{\\nu}\\rangle^2 \\cdot |m^{0\\nu}(a , z)|^2 \\cdot g^{0\\nu}(q_{\\beta\\beta},z ) ,   \\label{eq : nme}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the effective neutrino mass , @xmath9 is the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) , and @xmath10 is the kinematical factor proportional to the transition energy to the fifth power , @xmath11 .    the @xmath0 decay process is a rare second order weak interaction process .",
    "the accurate measurement of its rate of decay is important since it constitutes the ultimate background in the search for @xmath1 decay signal and is a valuable input for the theoretical calculations of the nme .",
    "the detector  @xcite is located in the lsm in the frejus tunnel at the depth of 4800 m w.e .",
    "it is cylindrical with thin source foils ( @xmath12 ) situated in the middle of the tracking volume surrounded by the calorimeter .",
    "the source foils are composed of almost 10 kg of enriched @xmath5 isotopes , listed in table  [ tab : t12 ] .",
    "observation of the @xmath5 decay is accomplished by fully reconstructing the tracks of the two electrons and measuring their energy .",
    "a tracking chamber containing 6180 open drift cells , operating in the geiger mode , provides a vertex resolution of about 1 cm and a 25 g magnetic field is used to curve the tracks for charge identification .",
    "a calorimeter consisting of 1940 plastic scintillator blocks with photomultiplier readout gives an energy resolution of 14 17%/@xmath13 fwhm .",
    "a time resolution of 250ps allows excellent suppression of the external background due to electrons crossing the detector .",
    "the detector is capable of identifying e@xmath14 , e@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles and allows good discrimination between signal and background events .",
    "the detector is covered by two layers of shielding against external @xmath16 rays and neutrons .",
    "the @xmath18 events are selected by requiring two reconstructed electron tracks with a curvature corresponding to the negative charge , originating from a common vertex in the source foil .",
    "the energy of each electron measured in the calorimeter should be higher than 200kev .",
    "each track must be incident upon a separate scintillator block and the time difference of the two pmt signals is compared to the estimated time as if the two electrons had originated from a common vertex .",
    "the background can be classified in three groups : external one from incoming @xmath19 , radon inside the tracking volume and internal radioactive contamination of the source .",
    "all three were estimated from the nemo-3 data with events of various topologies .",
    "in particular , radon was measured with e@xmath20 and e@xmath21 events and internal @xmath22bi with e@xmath21 .",
    "the e@xmath20@xmath20 , and e@xmath20@xmath20@xmath20 events are used to measure the @xmath23tl activity requiring the detection of the 2.615 mev @xmath20-ray typical of the @xmath23tl @xmath24 decay .",
    "single electron events are used to measure the foil contamination by @xmath24-emitters .",
    "the external background is measured with the events with the detected incoming @xmath20-ray producing an electron in the source foil .",
    "the external background is checked with two - electron events originating from pure copper and natural tellurium foils .",
