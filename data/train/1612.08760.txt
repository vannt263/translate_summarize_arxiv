    "categorification of representations of affine quantum groups has proved to be an important tool for understanding many classic objects arising from modular group representation theory , among which hecke algebras and rational cherednik algebras of cyclotomic type , and finite classical groups .",
    "more precisely , the study of crystals and canonical bases of the level @xmath2 fock space representations @xmath3 of @xmath4 gives answers to several classical problems in combinatorial terms .",
    "in particular , we know that the @xmath4-crystal graph of @xmath3 can be categorified in the following ways :    * by the parabolic branching rule for modular cyclotomic hecke algebras @xcite , when restricting to the connected component containing the empty @xmath2-partition , * by bezrukavnikov and etingof s parabolic branching rule for cyclotomic rational cherednik algebras @xcite , * by the weak harish - chandra modular branching rule on unipotent representations for finite unitary groups @xcite , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 varying .    in each case , the branching rule depends on some parameters that are explicitly determined by the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath6 of the fock space .",
    "recently , there has been some important developments when shan and vasserot @xcite categorified the action of the heisenberg algebra on a certain direct sum of fock spaces , in order to prove a conjecture by etingof @xcite .",
    "losev gave in @xcite a formulation of shan and vasserot s results in terms of crystals , as well as an explicit formula for computing it in a particular case . independently and using different methods , the author defined a notion of heisenberg crystal for higher level fock spaces @xcite , that turns out to coincide with losev s crystal .",
    "an explicit formula was also given in another particular case , using level - rank duality .",
    "like the @xmath4-crystal , the heisenberg crystal gives some information at the categorical level .",
    "in particular , it yields a characterisation of    * the finite dimensional irreducible modules in the cyclotomic cherednik category @xmath8 by @xcite and @xcite , * the usual cuspidal irreducible unipotent modular representations of finite unitary groups @xcite .",
    "this paper solves two remaining problems about the heisenberg crystal .",
    "firstly , even though it originally arises from the study of cyclotomic rational cherednik algebras ( it is determined by combinatorial versions of certain adjoint functors defined on the bounded derived category @xmath8 ) , the heisenberg crystal has an intrinsic existence as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask for an algebraic construction of the heisenberg crystal which would be independent of any categorical interpretation .",
    "this is achieved via the boson - fermion correspondence and the use of the schur functions , acting on uglov s canonical basis of @xmath3 .",
    "this gives a new realisation of the heisenberg crystal , analogous to kashiwara s crystals for quantum group .",
    "secondly , we give an explicit formula for computing the heisenberg crystal in full generality .",
    "this generalises and completes the particular results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is done in the spirit of @xcite where formulas for the @xmath4-crystal were explicited .",
    "the present paper has the following structure . in section 2 , we start by introducing in detail several combinatorial objects indexing the basis of the wedge space ( namely charged multipartitions , abaci and wedges ) and the different ways to identify them",
    ". then , we quickly recall some essential facts about the @xmath4-structure of the fock spaces @xmath3 .",
    "section 3 focuses on the heisenberg action on the wedge space @xmath9 , seen as a certain direct sum of level @xmath2 fock spaces @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we recall the definition of the heisenberg crystal given in @xcite .",
    "then , we give in section 4 a solution to the first problem mentioned above .",
    "more precisely , we recall the quantum boson - fermion correspondence and fundamental facts about symmetric functions . inspired by shan and vasserot @xcite and leclerc and thibon @xcite , we study the action of the schur functions on the wedge space and use a result of iijima @xcite to construct the heisenberg crystal as a version of this action at @xmath1 ( theorem [ thmschur ] ) , resembling kashiwara s philosophy of crystal and canonical bases .",
    "most importantly , by doing so , we bypass entirely shan and vasserot s original categorical construction .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the explicit computation of the heisenberg crystal .",
    "we introduce level @xmath2 vertical @xmath7-strips , as well as the notion of good addable and removable vertical strips by defining an appropriate order .",
    "the action of the heisenberg crystal operators is then given in terms of adding / removing good level @xmath2 vertical @xmath7-strips ( theorem [ thmheis ] ) , which is reminiscent of the explicit formula for the kashiwara crystal operators first given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
