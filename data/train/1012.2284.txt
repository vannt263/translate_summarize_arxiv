    "from a fundamental qed point of view the underlying mechanism responsible for van der waals ( vdw ) forces corresponds to two photon - exchange  ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . as compared to the short range and exponentially suppressed chemical bonding forces on sizes about a few bohr radii , vdw forces are long range . for interatomic separations",
    "@xmath0 , two photons are exchanged in a short time @xmath1 while transitions with excitation energy @xmath2 take a much larger time @xmath3 , yielding the potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the dispersion coefficients which are accurately known for many diatomic systems  ( see e.g. a compilation in @xcite ) .",
    "the vdw _ length _ @xmath6 characterizes the size of the forces . for such potentials , low energy scattering with @xmath7",
    "is dominated by s - waves which phase - shift , @xmath8 , fulfills the effective range expansion ( ere )  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scattering length , and @xmath11 is the effective range .",
    "note that for this potential the long - range character stars at @xmath12 due to the logarithmic piece .",
    "remarkably , the effective range was computed analytically  @xcite when @xmath13 yielding @xmath14 the scaling of the effective range @xmath11 in the vdw length and the quadratic @xmath15 behaviour is just a particular case of a more general result  @xcite ( see also  @xcite in these proceedings ) .",
    "in fact , the dominance of the leading long distance @xmath16 term tacitly assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite was to be expected _ a priori _ by suitably re - writing higher order @xmath17 , @xmath18 contributions in vdw units @xmath19 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 for many homonuclear diatomic systems .",
    "thus one expects that _ even _ for @xmath22 higher order corrections are negligible despite the strong divergence at short distance .",
    "these expectations are indeed met _ a posteriori _ on the light of about a hundred calculations based on phenomenological potentials  @xcite .",
    "this result not only favours the view that these rather simple approaches based on the leading vdw forces are phenomenologically sound but also shows that a huge reduction of parameters takes place suggesting that atoms in the ultra - cold regime can indeed be handled without much explicit reference to the underlying electronic structure of atoms .",
    "the scaling universal relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0-ggf ] ) , allows for a quite general discussion on effective interactions in vdw units , as we advance here .",
    "in the ultra - cold regime , i.e. for extremely long de broglie wavelengths much larger than the vdw scale , @xmath23 , one expects the long range character to become largely irrelevant , keeping the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ere ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : r0-ggf ] ) is not possible for a _ common _ potential .",
    "indeed , the sign of the @xmath29 term is just opposite , so that for small @xmath10 we can not represent the interaction by this short range potential . on the contrary , for large scattering lengths @xmath30",
    "we obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in terms of volume integrals ,",
    "@xmath33 one gets @xmath34 and @xmath35 . if we use instead a delta - shell ( ds ) potential @xmath36 we get for @xmath30 the results @xmath37 and @xmath38 , not far from the sw estimate .",
    "this suggests using a formulation based _ directly _ on the constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 . note",
    "that while a @xmath41 exists for these short distance potentials , the original vdw potential yields a divergence , in harmony with the observation that the ere for short range potentials differs at @xmath42 from the vdw expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0-ggf ] ) .",
    "the eft approach has often been invoked to highlight universal features of ultra - cold few atoms systems ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we re - analyze it on the light of the universal and extremely successful scaling relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0-ggf ] ) . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the galilean invariant lagrangian density  @xcite expanded in composite bosonic spinless field operators with increasing energy dimensions and including multi - particle interactions , @xmath43 ^ 2 -\\frac{d_0}6 ( \\psi^\\dagger \\psi ) ^3 + \\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath44 are low energy constants which are fixed from few body dynamics .",
    "using feynman rules in the two - body sector one derives a scale dependent and momentum truncated self - adjoint pseudo - potential in the cm system ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 are relative momenta ) @xmath47 \\theta ( \\lambda -k ) \\theta ( \\lambda -k ' ) \\ , .",

    "( [ eq : pot - mom ] ) the ls eq .",

    "the cut - off dependence for @xmath61 can be looked up at fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] in vdw units and for the specific case @xmath62 where a weakly bound state takes place .",
    "as we see there is a clear stability plateau in the region @xmath63 illustrating the basic point of the eft ; low energy physics is cut - off independent within a given cut - off window which does not resolve length scales shorter than the vdw scale . numerically we get @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath63 , in agreement with the previous sw and ds analysis .",
    "the values of @xmath48 where the eft low energy parameters diverge correspond to an upper bound above which @xmath39 and @xmath40 become complex , violating the self - adjointness of the potential  @xcite and the lagrangian , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , off - shell two - body unitarity and hence three - body unitarity are jeopardized for @xmath67 , despite the phase shift being real and on - shell unitarity being fulfilled .     when @xmath55 ( dashed red ) and @xmath68 and @xmath69 after eqs .",
