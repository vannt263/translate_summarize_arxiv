    "the interest in the course on theoretical physics , delivered by ettore majorana at the university of naples in 1938 , has been recently revived by the discovery of the moreno paper @xcite , which is a faithful transcription of the lecture notes prepared by majorana himself made by the student eugenio moreno .",
    "such a paper , in fact , includes some previously unknown lecture notes , whose original manuscripts seem to be missing",
    ". the handwritten notes by majorana are now kept at the domus galilaeana in pisa , and were anastatically reproduced some years ago @xcite by including also some papers , initially interpreted as the notes prepared for a forthcoming lecture that , however , majorana never gave due to his mysterious disappearance .",
    "as recently shown @xcite , instead , such spare papers can not be considered as notes for academic lectures , even for an advanced course as that delivered by majorana , but probably refer to a general conference given by him at a restricted audience interested in molecular physics .",
    "although the main topic of that dissertation was the application of quantum mechanics to the theory of molecular bonding , the present scientific interest in it is more centered on the interpretation given by majorana about some topics of the novel , for that time , quantum theory ( namely , the concept of quantum state ) and the direct application of this theory to a particular case ( that is , precisely , the molecular bonding ) .",
    "an accurate reading of the manuscript , in fact , not only discloses a peculiar cleverness of the author in treating a pivotal argument of the novel mechanics , but , keeping in mind that it was written in 1938 , also reveals a net advance of at least ten years in the use made of that topic .",
    "the last point , however , is quite common for majorana , and as only one example we refer here to the case of the thomas - fermi atomic model @xcite ( see , however , also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this point was already noted some years ago by n. cabibbo ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , who saw in the majorana manuscript a vague and approximate anticipation of the idea underlying the feynman interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of path integrals . a more analytic study , conducted on the critical edition of that paper @xcite which was not available at that time , but is here reported , for the first time , in translation , reveals instead some intriguing surprises , upon which we will here focus on .",
    "although the text considered is written in a very simple a clear form ( a feature which is very common in the majorana works @xcite ) , in the next section we give beforehand a brief discussion of the main ideas of the path - integral approach , followed by a simple presentation where the crucial passages in the majorana paper are pointed out .",
    "the general postulate upon which quantum mechanics is based tells that the  state \" of a certain physical system may be represented with a complex quantity @xmath1 , considered as a ( normalized ) vector in a given hilbert space corresponding to the physical system , where all the information on the system is contained @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the state vector is ruled by the schrdinger equation , that may be written in the general form : [ e1 ] i = h , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian operator of the considered system . the initial state at time @xmath3 is specified by its choice among the possible eigenstates of a complete set of commuting operators ( including , for example , the hamiltonian ) , while the hamiltonian @xmath2 itself determines the state of the system at a subsequent time @xmath4 through eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is thus completely determined if we evaluate the transition amplitude between the state at time @xmath3 and that at time @xmath5 .",
    "then , as we can easily see , the usual quantum - mechanical description of a given system is strongly centered on the role played by the hamiltonian @xmath2 and , as a consequence , the time variable plays itself a key role in this description .",
    "such a dissymmetry between space and time variables is , obviously , not satisfactory in the light of the postulates of the theory of relativity .",
    "this was firstly realized in 1932 by dirac @xcite , who put forward the idea of reformulating the whole quantum mechanics in terms of lagrangians rather than hamiltonians    the starting point in the dirac thought is that of exploiting an analogy , holding at the quantum level , with the hamilton principal function in classical mechanics @xcite . from this , the transition amplitude from a state in the spatial configuration @xmath6 at time @xmath7 to a state in the spatial configuration @xmath8 at time @xmath9 is written as : [ e2]q_b | q_a ~^ s = ^ _ t_a^t_b l t where @xmath10 is the lagrangian of the system and @xmath11 $ ] the action functional defined on the paths from @xmath6 to @xmath8 . the previous relationship , however , can not be considered as an equality as long as the time interval from @xmath7 to @xmath9 is finite , since it would lead to incorrect results ( and dirac himself was well aware of this ; in his paper he introduced several unjustified assumptions in order to overcome such a difficulty ) .",
    "in fact , by splitting the integration field in ( [ e2 ] ) into @xmath12 intervals , @xmath13 , the transition amplitude could be written as a product of terms , [ e3 ] q_b | q_a = q_b | q_n-1 q_n-1 | q_n-2 q_2 | q_1 q_1 | q_a , while it is well known that , by using the completeness relations , the correct formula contains the integration over the intermediate regions : & & q_b | q_a = q_b | q_n-1 | q_n-1 q_n-1 | ",
    "q_1 | q_1 q_1 | q_a + & & = q_1 q_2 q_n-1 q_b | q_n-1 q_2 | q_1 q_1 | q_a .",
    "[ e4 ] about ten year after the appearance of the dirac paper , feynman @xcite guessed that the relation in ( [ e2 ] ) should hold as an equality , up to a constant factor @xmath14 , only for transitions between states spaced by an _ infinitesimal _ time interval . in this case , by employing the correct formula in ( [ e4 ] ) , we obtain the well - known feynman expression for the transition amplitude between two given states : q_b | q_a & = & _   n + t_b - t_a finito a^n q_1 q_2 q_n-1 ^i s/ + & & q ^i s/ .",
    "[ e5 ] the meaning of the previous formula can be understand as follows . in the integrations present in it , which we have generically denoted with @xmath15 , the limits @xmath7 and @xmath9 in the integration interval are kept fixed , while we integrate over the space specified by the intermediate points . since every spatial configuration @xmath16 of these intermediate points corresponds to a given dynamical trajectory joining the initial point @xmath7 with the final one @xmath9 , the integration over all these configurations is equivalent to sum over _ all _ the possible paths from the initial point to the final one . in other words the feynman formula with the path integrals points out that the transition amplitude between an initial and a final state can be expressed as a sum of the factor @xmath17/\\hbar}$ ] over all the paths with fixed end - points .",
    "such a result , on one hand , it is not surprising if we consider that , in quantum mechanics , for a given process taking place through different ways , the transition amplitude is given by the sum of the partial amplitudes corresponding to _ all _ the possible ways through which the process happens .",
    "this is particularly evident , for example , in the classical experiment with an electron beam impinging on a screen through a double slit .",
    "the interference pattern observed on the screen at a given distance from the slit , should suggest that a single electron has crossed through both slits .",
    "it can be , then , explained by assuming that the probability that has one electron to go from the source to the screen through the double slit is obtained by summing over _ all _ the possible paths covered by the electron .",
    "thus the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics underlie the path - integral approach .",
    "however , what is crucial but unexpected in this approach is that the sum is made over the phase factor @xmath17/\\hbar}$ ] , which is generated by the classical action @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "one of the major merits of the feynman approach to quantum mechanics is the possibility to get in a very clear manner the classical limit when @xmath18 ( the other merits being its versatile applicability to field quantization in abelian or non abelian gauge theories , with or without spontaneous symmetry breaking ) .",
    "in fact for large values of @xmath19 compared to @xmath20 , the phase factor in ( [ e5 ] ) undergoes large fluctuations and thus contributes with terms which average to zero . from a mathematical point of view , it is then clear that in the limit @xmath18 the dominant contribution to eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) comes out when the phase factor does not varies much or , in other words , when the action @xmath19 is stationary .",
    "this result is precisely what emerges in classical mechanics , where the classical dynamical trajectories are obtained from the least action principle .",
    "this occurrence was firstly noted by dirac @xcite , who realized the key role played by the action functional .",
    "the intuitive interpretation of the classical limit is very simple .",
    "let us consider , in the @xmath21 space , a given path far away from the classical trajectory @xmath22 ; since @xmath20 is very small , the phase @xmath23 along this path will be quite large .",
    "for each of such paths there is another one which is infinitely close to it , where the action @xmath19 will change only for a small quantity , but since this is multiplied by a very large constant ( @xmath24 ) , the resulting phase will have a correspondingly large value . on average these paths",
    "will give a vanishing contribution in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "instead , near the classical trajectory @xmath22 the action is stationary , so that , passing by a path infinitely close to that classical to this last one , the action will not change at all .",
    "then the corresponding contributions in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) will sum coherently and , as a result , the dominant term is obtained for @xmath18 .",
    "thus , in such approach , the classical trajectory is picked out in the limit @xmath18 not because it mainly contributes to the dynamical evolution of the system , but rather because there are paths infinitely close to it that give contributions which sum coherently .",
    "the integration region is , actually , very narrow for classical systems , while it becomes wider for quantum ones . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of orbit itself , that in the classical case is well defined , for quantum systems comes to lose its meaning , as for example for an electron orbiting around the atomic nucleus .",
    "the discussion presented above of the path - integral approach to quantum mechanics has been deliberately centered on the mathematical aspect , rather than on the physical one , since the historical process has precisely followed this line , starting from the original dirac idea in 1932 and arriving at the feynman formulation in the forties ( one can usefully consult the original papers in @xcite and @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "just the development of the mathematical formalism has later led to the impressive physical interpretation mentioned previously .",
    "coming back to the majorana paper here considered , we immediately realize that it contains _ nothing _ of the mathematical aspect of the peculiar approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless an accurate reading reveals , as well , the presence of the _ physical _ foundations of it .    the starting point in majorana is to search for a meaningful and clear formulation of the concept of quantum state . and , obviously , in 1938 the dispute is opened with the conceptions of the old quantum theory .",

    "thus the quantum states come to be the minimal statistical sets of classical motions , from each other , accessible to the observations .",
    "these minimal statistical sets can not be further partitioned due to the uncertainty principle , introduced by heisenberg himself , which forbids the precise simultaneous measurement of the position and the velocity of a particle , that is the determination of its orbit .",

    "in fact , the different initial conditions are , in any case , always referred to the same initial time ( @xmath7 ) , while the determined quantum state corresponds to a fixed end time ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the introduced issue of  classical motions \" ( the emphasis is given by majorana himself ) , according to what specified by the heisenberg s uncertainty principle and mentioned just afterwards , is thus evidently related to that of the sufficiently wide integration region in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) for quantum systems . in this respect ,",
    "such a mathematical point is intimately related to a fundamental physical principle .",
    "the crucial point in the feynman formulation of quantum mechanics is , as seen above , to consider not only the paths corresponding to classical trajectories , but _ all _ the possible paths joining the initial point with the end one . in the majorana manuscript , after a discussion on an interesting example on the harmonic oscillator , the author points out :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ obviously the correspondence between quantum states and sets of classical solutions is only approximate , since the equations describing the quantum dynamics are in general independent of the corresponding classical equations , but denote a real modification of the mechanical laws , as well as a constraint on the feasibility of a given observation ; however it is better founded than the representation of the quantum states in terms of quantized orbits , and can be usefully employed in qualitative studies . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and , in a later passage , it is more explicitly stated that the wave function  corresponds in quantum mechanics to any possible state of the electron \" .",
    "such a reference , that only superficially could be interpreted , in the common acceptation , that all the information on the physical systems is contained in the wave function , should instead be considered in the meaning given by feynman , according to the comprehensive discussion made by majorana on the concept of state .",

    "furthermore , in the majorana paper , several interesting applications to atomic and molecular systems are present as well , where known results are deduced or re - interpreted according to the novel point of view .",
    "the search for such applications , however , will be left to the reader , who will benefit of the reading of the complete text by majorana reported in the following .",
    "the original manuscript by majorana , as it can be seen from ref .",
    "@xcite , reports ( at the beginning ) a sort of table of contents which , however , is only partially followed by the author . for the sake of ease , we have preferred to divide the whole text in some sections , according to the reported table of contents .      the internal energy of a closed system ( atom , molecule , etc .",
    ") can take , according to quantum mechanics , discrete values belonging to a set @xmath26 composed of the so - called energy `` eigenvalues '' .",
    "to each given value of the energy we can associate a  quantum state \" , that is a state where the system may remain indefinitely without external perturbations . as an example of these perturbations",
    ", we can in general consider the coupling of the system with the radiation field , by means of which the system may loose energy in form of electromagnetic radiation , jumping from an energy level @xmath27 to a lower one @xmath28 .",
    "only when the internal energy takes the minimum value @xmath29 , it can not be further decrease by means of radiation ; in this case the system is said to be in its  ground state \" from which it can not be removed without sufficiently strong external influences , such as the scattering with fast particles or with light quanta of large frequency .",
    "+ what is the corresponding concept of quantum state in classical mechanics ?",
    "an answer is primarily required to such a question , in order to have a correct representation of the results obtained in our field by quantum mechanics , without entering , however , in the complex computational methods adopted by this . + in classical mechanics the motion of a system composed of @xmath12 mass points is entirely determined when the coordinates @xmath30 of all the points are known as function of time : [ a1 ] q_i = q_i(t ) eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) give the dynamical equations where all the internal and external forces acting on the system are present , and they can always be chosen in such a way that at a given instant all the coordinates @xmath31 and their time derivatives @xmath32 take arbitrarily fixed values .",
    "thus the general solution of the equations of motion must depend @xmath33 arbitrary constants .",
    "+ for system with atomic dimensions the classical representation no longer holds and two successive modifications have been proposed .",
    "the first one , due to bohr and sommerfeld and that has provided very useful results , has been afterwards completely abandoned with the emerging of the novel quantum mechanics , which has been the only one to give an extremely general formalism , fully confirmed by the experiences on the study of the elementary processes . according to the old theory of bohr - sommerfeld , classical mechanics still holds in describing the atom , so that the motion of an electron , for example , around the hydrogen nucleus is still described by a solution ( [ a1 ] ) of the equations of classical mechanics",
    "; however , if we consider periodic motions , such as the revolution of an electron around the nucleus , not all the solutions of the classical equations are realized in nature , but only a discrete infinity of those satisfying the so - called sommerfeld conditions , that is certain cabalistic - like integral relations .",
    "for example in every periodic motion in one dimension , the integral of the double of the kinetic energy over the period @xmath34 : @xmath35 must be an integer multiple of the planck constant ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the combination of classical mechanics with a principle which is unrelated with it , such as that of the quantized orbits , appears so hybrid that it should be not surprising the complete failure of that theory occurred in the last decade , irrespective of several favorable experimental tests which was supposed to be conclusive .",
    "+ the novel quantum mechanics , primarily due to heisenberg , is substantially more closed to the classical conceptions than the old one . according to the heisenberg theory",
    ", a quantum state corresponds not to a strangely privileged solution of the classical equations but rather to a set of solutions which differ for the initial conditions and even for the energy , i.e. what it is meant as precisely defined energy for the quantum state corresponds to a sort of average over the infinite classical orbits belonging to that state .",
    "thus the quantum states come to be the minimal statistical sets of classical motions , from each other , accessible to the observations .",
    "these minimal statistical sets can not be further partitioned due to the uncertainty principle , introduced by heisenberg himself , which forbids the precise simultaneous measurement of the position and the velocity of a particle , that is the determination of its orbit .",
    "+ an harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath37 can oscillate classically with arbitrary amplitude and phase , its energy being given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is its mass and @xmath40 the maximum elongation . according to quantum mechanics",
    "the possible values for @xmath41 are , as well known , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ,  @xmath44  ; in this case we can say that the ground state with energy @xmath45 corresponds roughly to all the classical oscillations with energy between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the first excited state with energy @xmath48 corresponds to the classical solutions with energy between @xmath47 and @xmath49 , and so on .",
    "obviously the correspondence between quantum states and sets of classical solutions is only approximate , since the equations describing the quantum dynamics are in general independent of the corresponding classical equations , but denote a real modification of the mechanical laws , as well as a constraint on the feasibility of a given observation ; however it is better founded than the representation of the quantum states in terms of quantized orbits , and can be usefully employed in qualitative studies .",
    "systems showing some symmetry property deserve a particular study . for these systems , due to symmetry considerations alone , from one particular solution of the classical equations of motion @xmath50 we can deduce , in general , some other different ones @xmath51 .",
    "for example if the system contains two or more electrons or , in general , two or more identical particles , from one given solution we can obtain another solution , which in general will be different from the previous one , just by changing the coordinates of two particles .",
    "analogously if we consider an electron moving in the field of two identical nuclei or atoms ( denoted with @xmath14 and @xmath52 in the figure ) , starting from an allowed orbit @xmath50 described around @xmath14 with a given law of motion , we can deduce another orbit @xmath51 described by the electron around the nucleus or atom @xmath52 by a reflection with respect to the center @xmath53 of the line @xmath54 .",
    "= 6.5truecm    the exchange operations between two identical particles , reflection with respect to one point or other ones corresponding to any symmetry property , keep their meaning in quantum mechanics .",
    "thus it is possible to deduce from a state @xmath19 another one @xmath25 , , if in the two mentioned examples we exchange two identical particle between them and reflect the system with respect to the point @xmath53 .",
    "however , differently from what happens in classical mechanics for the of the dynamical equations , in general it is no longer true that @xmath25 will be distinct from @xmath19 .",
    "we can realize this easily by representing @xmath25 with a set of classical solutions , as seen above ; it then suffices that @xmath19 includes , for any given solution , even the other one obtained from that solution by applying a symmetry property of the motions of the systems , in order that @xmath25 results to be identical to @xmath19 .",
    "+ in several cases , if the system satisfies sufficiently complex symmetry properties , it is instead possible to obtain , by symmetry on a given quantum state , other different states but with the same energy . in this case",
    "the system is said to be , i.e it has many states with the same energy , exactly due to its symmetry properties .",
    "the study of degenerate systems and of the conditions under which degeneration can take place will bring us too far and , in any case , it is difficult to made such a study in terms of only classical analogies",
    ". then we will leave it completely aside and limit our attention to problems without degeneration .",
    "this condition is always satisfied if the symmetry of the mechanical system allows only a so simple transformation that its square , that is the transformation applied twice , reduces to the identity transformation .",
    "for example , by a double reflection of a system of mass points with respect a plane , a line or a point , we necessarily recover the same initial arrangement ; analogously , the system remains unaltered by changing twice two identical particles . in all these cases we have only simple quantum states , i.e. to every possible value of the energy",
    "it is associated only one quantum state .",
    "it follows that all the quantum states of system containing two identical particles are symmetric with respect to the two particles , remaining unaltered under their exchange .",
    "thus the states of an electron orbiting around two identical nuclei @xmath14 and @xmath52 are symmetric with respect to the middle point @xmath53 of @xmath54 , or remain unaltered by reflection in @xmath53 , and analogously for other similar cases . under given assumptions , that are verified in the very simple problems which we will consider , we can say that every quantum state possesses all the symmetry properties of the constraints of the system .",
    "let us consider an electron moving in the field of two hydrogen nuclei or protons .",
    "the system composed by the two protons and the electron has a net resulting charge of @xmath55 and constitutes the simplest possible molecule , that is the positively ionized hydrogen molecule . in such a system the protons are able to move as well as the electron , but due to the large mass difference between the first ones and the second one ( mass ratio 1840:1 ) the mean velocity of the protons is much lower than that of the electron , and the motion of this can be studied with great accuracy by assuming that the protons are at rest at a given mutual distance .",
    "this distance is determined , by stability reasons , in such a way that the total energy of the molecule , that at a first approximation is given by the sum of the mutual potential energy of the two protons and the energy of the electron moving in the field of the first ones , and is different for different electron quantum states , is at a minimum .",
    "+ the mutual potential energy of the protons is given by @xmath56 if @xmath57 is their distance , while the binding energy of the electron in its ground state is a negative function @xmath58 of @xmath57 that does not have a simple analytic expression , but it can be obtained from quantum mechanics with an arbitrary large accuracy . the equilibrium distance @xmath59 is then determined by the condition that the total energy is at a minimum : @xmath60 the curve @xmath61 has a behavior like that shown in the figure , if we assume that zero energy corresponds to the molecule which is dissociated into a neutral hydrogen atom and a ionized atom at an infinite distance . the equilibrium distance    = 3.5 cm    has been theoretically evaluated by burrau finding @xmath62 cm and , for the corresponding energy , @xmath63 electron - volt .",
    "both these results have been fully confirmed by observations on the spectrum emitted by the neutral or ionized molecule , that indirectly depends on them . + what is the origin of the force @xmath64 that tends to get close the two hydrogen nuclei when they are at a distance larger than @xmath59 ?",
    "the answer given by quantum mechanics to this question is surprising since it seems to show that , beside certain polarization forces which can be foreseen by classical mechanics , a predominant role is played by a completely novel kind of forces , the so - called .",
    "+ let us suppose the distance @xmath57 to be large with respect to the radius of the neutral hydrogen atom ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "then the electron undergoes the action of one or the other of the two protons , around each of them can classically describe closed orbits . the system composed by the electron and the nucleus around which it orbits forms a neutral hydrogen atom , so that our molecule results to be essentially composed by one neutral atom and one proton at a certain distance from the first .",
    "the neutral hydrogen atom in its ground state has a charge distribution with spherical symmetry , classically meaning that all the orientations of the electronic orbit are equally possible , and the negative charge density exponentially decreases with the distance in such a way that the atomic radius can practically be considered as finite ; it follows that no electric field is generated outside a neutral hydrogen atom , and thus no action can be exerted on a proton at a distance @xmath57 which is large compared to the atomic dimensions .",
    "however the neutral atom can be polarized under the action of the external proton and acquire an electric moment along the proton - neutral atom direction , and from the interaction of this electric moment with the non uniform field generated by the proton it comes out an attractive force which tends to combine the atom and the ion in a molecular system .",
    "+ the , which can be easily predicted with classical arguments , can give origin alone to molecular compounds , that however are characterized by a pronounced fleetingness .",
    "more stable compounds can only be obtained if other forces are considered in addition to the polarization ones . in the polar molecules , composed of two ions of different sign charge ,",
    "such forces are essentially given by the electrostatic attraction between the ions ; for example the @xmath66 molecule is kept together essentially by the mutual attraction between the @xmath67 positive ion and the @xmath68 negative one .",
    "however in molecule composed by two neutral atoms , or by a neutral atom and a ionized one , as in the case of the molecular ion @xmath69 , the is essentially driven by the phenomenon of the resonance , according to the meaning assumed by this word in the novel mechanics , which has no parallel in classical mechanics .",
    "+ when we study , from the quantum mechanics point of view , the motion of the electron in the field of the two protons , assumed to be fixed at a very large mutual distance @xmath57 , at a first approximation we can determine the energy levels by assuming that the electron should move around the proton @xmath14 ( or @xmath52 ) and neglecting the influence of the other proton in @xmath52 ( or @xmath14 ) , which exerts a weak perturbative action due to its distance . for the lowest energy eigenvalue @xmath29 we thus obtain a state @xmath19 corresponding to the formation of a neutral atom in its ground state consisting of the electron and the nucleus @xmath14 , and a state @xmath25 corresponding to a neutral atom composed by the electron and the nucleus @xmath52 . now if we take into account the perturbation that in both cases is exerted on the neutral atom by the positive ion , we again find , as long as the perturbation is small , not two eigenvalues equal to @xmath29 but two eigenvalues @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are slightly different from @xmath29 and both close to this value ; however the quantum states corresponding to them , let be @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are not separately close to @xmath19 e @xmath25 , since , due to the fact that the potential field where the electron moves is symmetric with respect to the middle point of @xmath54 , the same symmetry must be shown , for what said above , by the effective states @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the electron , while it is not separately shown by @xmath19 and @xmath25 . + according to the model representation of the quantum states introduced above , @xmath19 consists of a set of electronic orbits around @xmath14 , and analogously @xmath25 of a set of orbits around @xmath52 , while the true quantum states of the system @xmath72 and @xmath73 each correspond , at a first approximation for very large @xmath57 , for one half to the orbits in @xmath19 and for the other half to those in @xmath25 .",
    "the computations prove , that for sufficiently large nuclear distances , the mean value of the perturbed eigenvalue @xmath70 and @xmath71 coincides closely to the single unperturbed value @xmath29 , while their difference is not negligible and has a conclusive importance in the present as well as in infinite other analogous cases of the study of the chemical reactions .",
    "we can thus suppose that @xmath74 but @xmath75 , and then @xmath72 will be the ground state of the electron , while @xmath73 will correspond to the excited state with a slightly higher energy .",
    "+ the electron in the @xmath72 state , as well as in the @xmath73 state , spends half of its time around the nucleus @xmath14 and the other half around the nucleus @xmath52 . we can also estimate the mean frequency of the periodic transit of the electron from @xmath14 to @xmath52 and viceversa , or of the neutral or ionized state exchange between the two atoms , thus finding @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the planck constant . for large values of @xmath57 , @xmath78 decreases according to an exponential - like curve and thus the exchange frequency rapidly tends to zero , this meaning that the electron which was initially placed around @xmath14 remains here for an increasingly larger time , as expected from a classical point of view .",
    "+ if the electron is in the state @xmath72 , that is in its ground state , its energy ( @xmath70 ) is lower than he would have without the mentioned exchange effect between nuclei @xmath14 and @xmath52 .",
    "this occurrence gives origin to a novel kind of attractive forces among the nuclei , in addition to the polarization forces considered above , and are exactly the dominant cause of the molecular bonding .",
    "+ the resonance forces , as said , has no analogy in classical mechanics .",
    "however , as long as the analogy leading to the correspondence between a quantum state and a statistical set of classical motions can hold , the two states @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the resonance forces have opposite sign too , each one result composed identically by half of both the original unperturbed states @xmath19 and @xmath25",
    ". this , however , is true only at a certain approximation , that is exactly at the approximation where we can neglect the resonance forces . for an exact computation taking into account the resonance forces we must necessarily use quantum mechanics , and thus find a difference in the structure of the two quantum states that manifest itself mainly in the intermediate region between @xmath14 and @xmath52 through which a periodic transit of the electron between one atom and the other takes place , according to a mechanism that can not be described by classical mechanics . such a qualitative difference is purely formal in nature and we can deal with it only by introducing the wave function @xmath79 that , as known , corresponds in quantum mechanics to any possible state of the electron .",
    "the modulus of the square of @xmath1 , which can also be a complex quantity , gives the probability that the electron lies in the volume unit around a generic point @xmath80 .",
    "the wave function @xmath1 must then satisfy to a linear differential equation and thus we can always multiply @xmath1 in any point by a fixed real or complex number of modulus @xmath81 , this constraint being required by the normalization condition @xmath82 which is necessary for the mentioned physical interpretation of @xmath83 .",
    "the multiplication of @xmath1 by a constant of modulus @xmath81 leaves unaltered the spatial distribution of the electronic charge , and has in general no physical meaning .",
    "now we will formally define the reflection of a quantum state with respect to the middle point @xmath53 between the two nuclei @xmath14 and @xmath52 directly on the wave function @xmath1 , by setting @xmath84 in a coordinate frame with origin in @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath1 should represent a symmetric quantum states , and thus invariant by reflection in @xmath53 , the reflected wave function @xmath85 must have the same physical meaning of @xmath1 and thus differ from @xmath1 , for what said , for a real or complex constant factor of modulus @xmath81 .",
    "moreover such a constant factor has to be @xmath86 , since its square must give the unity , due to the fact that by a further reflection of @xmath85 with respect to the point @xmath53 we again obtain the initial wave function @xmath1 .",
    "+ for all the states of the system we than must have : @xmath87 where the @xmath88 sign holds for a part of them , and the @xmath0 one for the others .",
    "the formal difference between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 states considered above consists precisely in the fact that , in the previous equation , the upper sign holds for @xmath72 while the lower one for @xmath73 .",
    "the symmetry with respect to one point and , in general , any symmetry property , determines a formal splitting of the state of the system in two or more sectors , an important property of this splitting being that no transition between different sectors can be induced by external perturbations respecting the symmetries shown by the constraints of the system .",
    "thus in systems containing two electrons , we have two kinds of not combinable states which are determined by the fact that the wave function , which now depends on the coordinates of both the electrons , remains unaltered or changes its sign by exchanging the two identical particles . in the special case of the helium atom",
    "this gives rise to the well known spectroscopic appearance of two distinct elements : parahelium and _",
    "orthohelium_. + the theory of the chemical affinity between the neutral hydrogen atom and the ionized one , which we have considered until now , can be extended to the study of the neutral hydrogen molecule and , more in general , of all the molecules resulting from two equal neutral atoms . instead of",
    "only one electron moving around two fixed protons , for the neutral hydrogen molecule we should consider electrons moving in the same field , neglecting at a first approximation their mutual repulsion .",
    "the stability of the molecule can then be understood by assuming that each of the two electrons lies in the @xmath72 state , corresponding to attractive resonance forces . according to f. hund",
    "we can say that the hydrogen molecule is kept together by two `` bounding '' electrons .",
    "however the interaction between the two electrons is so large to leave only a qualitative explanation for the schematic theory by hund , but in principle we could predict exactly all the properties of the hydrogen molecule , by solving with a sufficient precision the equations introduced by quantum mechanics . in this way , with appropriate mathematical methods , we can effectively determine the chemical affinity between two neutral hydrogen atoms with only theoretical considerations , and the theoretical value agrees with the experimental one , given the precision of the computation imposed by practical reasons .",
    "+ for molecules different from the hydrogen one , the theory of the chemical affinity is considerably more complex , due both to the larger number of electrons to be considered and to the pauli principle , forbidding the simultaneous presence of more than two electrons in the same state ; however the different theories of the chemical affinity proposed in the last years , each of which has an applicability range more or less large , practically consist in the search for approximated computation methods for a mathematical problem that is exactly determined in itself , and not in the enunciation of novel physical principles .",
    "+ then it is possible to bring the theory of the valence saturations back to more general principles of physics .",
