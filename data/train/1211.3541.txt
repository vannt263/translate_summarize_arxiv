    "despite important progress in the study of the structure and evolution of the galactic disk , many questions remain unanswered , such as the location of inner spiral arms or determination of the corotation distance .",
    "open star clusters ( ocls ) play the most important role in the investigation of galactic disk properties , because their ages , distances , and colour excesses can be easily evaluated from photometric ccd observations . however , the number of investigated ocls with the heliocentric distances above 2 kpc is still small .",
    "we developed and carry out a program of investigation of the perseus spiral arm based on the space and age distributions of open clusters .",
    "we already obtained bvri ccd photometry and estimated the main physical parameters of six ocls in this region : king 13 , king 18 , king 19 , king 20 , ngc 136 , and ngc 7245 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this study is concerned with another sample of six open clusters located toward the perseus spiral arm : berkeley 96 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , berkeley 97 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , king 12 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , ngc 7261 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , ngc 7296 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , and ngc 7788 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",

    "@xcite evaluated the distance to the cluster @xmath33 kpc , its age @xmath34 myr , and colour excess @xmath35 mag , using @xmath36 magnitudes from 2mass point source catalog @xcite exclusively .    * king 12 .",
    "* @xcite obtained photoelectric @xmath29 magnitudes for 30 stars and found the cluster distance to be @xmath37 kpc and its colour excess @xmath4 to vary from 0.52 to 0.69 mag ( differential reddening ) .",

    "obtained photoelectric @xmath29 photometry for 28 stars and photographic @xmath29 photometry for 53 stars ; @xcite measured @xmath29 photoelectric magnitudes for two stars ; @xcite measured photographic bv magnitudes for seven stars .",
    "* ngc 7296 .",
    "* based on @xmath46 and @xmath47 ccd photometry for about 140 stars , @xcite determined the cluster age @xmath48 myr , distance @xmath49 pc , and colour excesses @xmath50 and @xmath51 mag .",
    "* ngc 7788 . * @xcite measured photoelectric @xmath29 magnitudes of five stars ; @xcite measured photographic @xmath29 magnitudes of 113 stars ; and @xcite found photographic @xmath52 magnitudes of 67 stars .",
    "the clusters be 96 , king 12 , ngc 7261 , and ngc 7788 were studied by means of photographic and photoelectric photometry down to v - band limiting magnitudes of 14.516.5 mag . according to the estimates reported by the above authors and by @xcite for ngc 7788 , the distances to all these clusters exceed 2 kpc .",
    "hence the published colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) isochrone fits involved only the upper parts of the main sequences of the clusters studied whose physical parameters could therefore be determined with large errors .",
    "berkeley 97 was studied using only @xmath53 data , also down to a shallow limiting magnitude .",
    "the only published color - magnitude diagram of ngc 7296 is based on ccd photometry and goes down to a v - band limiting magnitude of 16.8 mag .",
    "ccd data is known to be often fraught with systematic errors and we therefore decided to repeat the observations of this cluster .",
    "we also wanted to verify a very small value @xmath54 derived by @xcite .",
    "all these factors justify our choice of the six open clusters listed above .",
    "we observed six open clusters in the johnson / kron  cousins broadband @xmath0 using the zeiss1000 telescope at the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences equipped with a photometer based on an eev 4240 2k @xmath55 2k ccd .",
    "the pixel size , readout noise , and gain were equal to 13.5 @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 per adu , respectively .",
    "the scale and field of view were equal to @xmath59/pixel and about @xmath60 , and @xmath61/pixel and about @xmath62 during the 2003 and 2009 observations , respectively .",
    "the scale and field of view size differences were due to changed photometer layout .",
    "table 1 shows the log of observations .",
    "its columns contain dates of observation , object names , air masses @xmath63 , and exposure times in each band .",
    "figure 1 shows the images of all six clusters under study taken in @xmath64band with the exposure 300 s with the limiting magnitude of about 21 mag .",
    ".log of observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         primary data processing , image extraction , and analysis were performed in the standard way using the eso - midas environment and the daophot / allstar program package @xcite . prior to the data reduction , we transformed the pixel coordinates for every star into celestial coordinates for the epoch j2000 .",
    "in addition to the program clusters studied , the open cluster ngc 7790 was observed several times for each night as a photometric standard , and the ngc 6940 cluster was used once as a photometric standard ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the standard magnitudes for stars in the fields of ngc 7790 and ngc 6940 were taken from stetson s database .",
    "the ranges of magnitudes and colours for about 250 standard stars in the cluster field are @xmath65 and @xmath66 mag , respectively .",
    "we used the following formulae @xcite to transform the magnitudes and colours from the instrumental to the standard system : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are the magnitudes in the instrumental system and @xmath76 , @xmath64 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the magnitudes in the standard system .",
    "the formula for the @xmath64 magnitude as a function of @xmath79 colour was used only for the stars without @xmath76 magnitudes .",
    "the averages of the median coefficients were @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for the observations done in 2003 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for the observations done in 2009 ( the @xmath90 deviations are given as the errors ) .",
    "we used mean values to recalculate the zero points @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for the times of observations of the standard clusters .",
    "the differences in the @xmath96 coefficients are presumably due to the changes in the photometer layout mentioned above .",
    "as shown in table 1 , the standard clusters ngc 7790 and ngc 6940 , and all program clusters were observed at the same air mass @xmath97 .",
    "this explains why we did not estimate the extinction coefficients . in the cases where",
    "ngc 7790 was observed twice , before and after the program cluster , we calculated the zero points of the transformation expressions by a linear interpolation between zero point values calculated from the standard cluster .",
    "weighted mean @xmath64 magnitudes and @xmath98 , @xmath79 , and @xmath99 colours were computed and published only for those stars in the fields of the six program clusters , for which the magnitudes and colours derived from different frames and reduced to the standard system differ by less than 0.1 mag . this value ( 0.1 mag )",
    "seems to be the typical magnitude error for the faintest measured stars and , at the same time , close to 3@xmath100-variance of magnitudes measured on different frames .",
    "the final values of the errors in the magnitudes and colours were calculated as the @xmath90 errors of the weighted mean on all frames ( taking into account the errors in the aperture corrections and the errors introduced by the transformation from the instrumental system to the standard one ) . however ,",
    "if the @xmath90 deviation of the magnitude or colour calculated on all frames exceeded the @xmath90 error of the weighted mean , this @xmath90 deviation was taken as the final error .",
    "the results of the photometric study of the clusters berkeley 96 , berkeley 97 , king 12 , ngc 7261 , ngc 7296 , and ngc 7788 are presented in tables 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 , respectively .",
    "tables 49 are available in the electronic form only and are accessible at the cds website and at the sternberg astronomical institute website . in this paper , we list a sample of few lines of table 4 only as an example .",
    "tables 59 have the same layout .",
    "the tables include the equatorial coordinates @xmath101 and @xmath102 in degrees at the epoch j2000 , @xmath64 magnitudes and @xmath98 , @xmath79 , and @xmath99 colours and their errors @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 for individual stars .",
    "we used 99.999 in all cells where the corresponding values are not available .",
    "we derived @xmath64 magnitudes and @xmath98 , @xmath79 , and @xmath99 colours for the stars in the fields of berkeley 96 , berkeley 97 , king 12 , ngc 7261 , ngc 7296 , and ngc 7788 . in fig .",

    "the errors do not exceed 0.10 mag ; the magnitude limit is 20 - 21.5 mag , depending on the band .",
    "the colour plots for ngc 7261 show narrow `` tails '' , because only one frame in each band was taken with the exposure 300 s , and no averaging was performed ; the same is seen for @xmath106 ( berkeley 96 ) .    we compared the derived magnitudes and colours with published photometry and",
    "show the magnitude and colour differences in fig .",
    "[ liter ] .",
    "our photometric data are in good agreement with all other photoelectric data - see plots for be 96 and king 12 , `` star '' symbols on the plots for ngc 7261 and ngc 7788 .",
    "in contrast , the comparison of our ccd photometry with photographic values reported elsewhere exhibits rather wide spread , as shown by the `` dot '' symbols on the plots for ngc 7261 and ngc 7788 .",
    "we also found systematic differences of approximately @xmath108 mag in @xmath64 and @xmath109 mag in @xmath79 between our values and those derived by @xcite for ngc 7296 .",
    "differences in the @xmath98 colours show the systematic trend from @xmath110 to @xmath111 mag .",
    "however , 32 common stars identified in the apass catalogue show small negative differences of about @xmath112 mag in @xmath64 and @xmath113 mag in @xmath98 , respectively .    to estimate the cluster distance , age , and colour excess toward the cluster , we built the following colour  magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for each program cluster : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116  from our data , and @xmath117 , @xmath118  from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "the faint stars with colour errors exceeding @xmath119 mag were excluded from our consideration .",
    "we then fit each cmd to a solar - metallicity isochrone by @xcite using the method developed by @xcite . in this method we superimposed the isochrone on the colour",
    " magnitude diagram in such a way that the corresponding plot for the radial density distribution exhibits a peak for the stars lying in the vicinity of the isochrone ( the distance in the colour index for such stars is less than @xmath119 mag ) and an almost flat distribution for all other stars ( supposed field stars ) .",
    "the centers of clusters were found from density maps built using data from the 2mass psc .",
    "we considered the position of the maximum of the density peak as the center of the cluster , and the distance from the cluster center , at which the star density in the cluster region becomes flat on the radial density distribution and equal to the density of field stars , as the cluster radius . in this way we evaluated the distance , colour excess , and age for each cluster on each cmd . to convert the colour excesses found from different colour  magnitude diagrams to the colour excess @xmath4 and to calculate the distance modulus",
    ", we used the following relations : @xmath120 ( @xcite ) and @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ( @xcite ) .",

    "the parameters derived from different colour  magnitude diagrams agree well , although for some clusters we can see small differences in @xmath4 values estimated separately from optical and infrared data .",
    "we suppose that these differences can be due to greater contamination of the infrared cmds by field stars as compared to optical data , and to the uncertainties of color excess transformations used .",
    "the final values of mean colour excesses and the true distance moduli , along with their @xmath90 deviations , are listed in table 3 .",
    "all cmds yield approximately the same age estimates for each cluster , so we did not put any errors for the ages , which generally depend on the isochrones used .",
    "we could not derive the cluster parameters from the @xmath118 diagram for ngc 7788 , because of the large dispersion of stars in this cmd .",
    "let us compare our parameters with those from the literature .",
    "table 3 contains the colour excesses @xmath4 , true distance moduli @xmath135 , distances @xmath74 in parsecs , and logarithms of the age @xmath136 from this paper and different published sources . for the clusters king 12 , ngc 7261 , and ngc 7788 , we include data from both @xcite and @xcite , because @xcite determined the distance moduli , and @xcite included these distances in his catalogue .",
    "table 3 shows that only in the case of the king 12 cluster our parameters are in good agreement with those obtained in the previous study by @xcite . for the remaining five clusters investigated in this study",
    ", the physical parameters have been considerably improved .      for three clusters  berkeley 97 , king 12 , and ngc 7788",
    " we noticed gaps on their main sequences on all cmds built from our bv@xmath77@xmath78 ccd photometry . to verify these gaps , we extracted @xmath74 and @xmath75 data from the iphas survey ( @xcite ) and transformed these values from the sdss system into cousins @xmath137 , @xmath138 magnitudes using empirical colour transformations by @xcite .",

    "we used the least of the two values obtained by @xmath64 and @xmath78 images according to @xcite .",

    "the members of each cluster were selected by photometric criteria using @xmath116 diagrams .",
    "we built the pdlf for stars inside the cluster radius and for the field stars , and corrected both functions for the incompleteness factor and for the area difference .",
    "the resulting pdlf is the difference between the cluster pdlf and the field stars pdlf .    to convert the luminosity function into the mass function , we used stellar evolutionary tracks and solar - metallicity isochrones by @xcite .",
