    "ultracold fermi gases have recently gathered much theoretical and experimental attention as highly controllable many - body systems@xcite . a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance@xcite",

    "the system is dominated by strong pairing fluctuations , so that the formation of preformed cooper pairs , as well as their effects on physical properties , have extensively been discussed@xcite .",
    "recently various thermodynamic quantities have become accessible in the field of cold fermi gas physics@xcite , allowing us to directly compare theoretical studies of the strong - coupling properties of an ultracold fermi gas@xcite with experimental results .",
    "since the formation of preformed cooper pairs due to a strong pairing interaction is expected to affect the entropy @xmath6 of the system , the specific heat ( which is directly related to the change in entropy ) is a useful thermodynamic quantity to study this key many - body phenomenon in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "indeed , a recent experiment on a @xmath1li unitary fermi gas@xcite observed that the specific heat at constant volume @xmath0 deviates from the linear temperature dependence known in a normal fermi liquid@xcite . in the normal state near @xmath2 , the observed @xmath0 exhibits an anomalous enhancement with decreasing temperature , which resembles the so - called @xmath3-structure observed in liquid @xmath4he@xcite .",
    "although this resemblance infers that some form of bose excitations are responsible for the anomalous behavior of @xmath0 in a @xmath1li unitary fermi gas near @xmath2 , it is unclear to what extent a unitary fermi gas with strong pairing fluctuations can be regarded as an interacting bose system , like liquid @xmath4he .    in this paper , we investigate the specific heat at constant volume @xmath0 , and effects of pairing fluctuations in the bcs - bec crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas , above the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 . including pairing fluctuations within the framework developed by nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr)@xcite , we show that strong - coupling corrections to @xmath0 , near @xmath2 , in the unitarity limit are sufficient to explain the anomalous enhancement of @xmath0 that has recently been observed in a @xmath1li fermi gas .",

    "since this high temperature behavior is well described by the case of a free fermi gas ( @xmath45 ) , this temperature dependence may be simply attributed to the fermi statistical effect .",
    "while the free fermi gas result @xmath45 monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature , the specific heat @xmath0 at the unitarity is enhanced in the low temperature region , @xmath48 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](a ) , this enhancement semi - quantitatively agrees with the recent experiment on a @xmath1li fermi gas@xcite .",
    "since the physical properties of a unitary fermi gas are known to be dominated by strong pairing fluctuations near @xmath2@xcite , this anomaly in @xmath0 is also considered as a strong - coupling phenomenon associated with strong fluctuations in the cooper channel . indeed , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig.2](a ) resembles the case of liquid @xmath4he@xcite , where stable atoms constituting this bose liquid are responsible for the famous @xmath3-structure in the temperature dependence of the specific heat near the superfluid instability . since pairing fluctuations in a unitary fermi gas",
    "are accompanied by preformed cooper pairs , it is an interesting problem whether or not the observed enhancement of @xmath0 can be understood by regarding a unitary fermi gas as a  bose gas \" of stable preformed cooper pairs .    to examine this , it is convenient to divide the number equation ( [ eq.9 ] ) into the sum of the free fermion part , @xmath49 and the fluctuation contribution coming from the second term in eq .",

    "apart from the prefactor of the bose distribution function in eq .",

    ", the prefactor is reduced to two , and the molecular dispersion becomes @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 ) , as expected .",
    "to conclude , the fluctuation contribution @xmath62 can be decomposed into twice the number of stable preformed cooper pair molecules @xmath59 and the so - called scattering part @xmath63@xcite , the latter of which physically describes the number of _ metastable _ preformed pairs with a finite lifetime .    , as well as and",

    "[ fig.3 ] , while the fluctuation contribution @xmath54 at @xmath2 is dominated by stable molecules ( @xmath59 ) in the strong - coupling bec regime , they are absent in the unitarity limit@xcite .",
    "this indicates that , although the enhanced specific heat @xmath66 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](a ) is similar to the @xmath3-structure in the case of liquid @xmath4he , their origins are different from each other . while _ stable _",
    "@xmath4he atoms are responsible for this anomaly in a liquid @xmath4he , the suppression of the entropy due to the formation of _ metastable _ preformed pairs , with decreasing temperature , leads to the amplification of the specific heat near @xmath2 in a unitary fermi gas , through the thermodynamic relation ,    @xmath67    we see in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] that the number @xmath63 of metastable cooper pairs at @xmath2 first increases , as one approaches the unitarity regime from the weak - coupling bcs side .",
    "since the increase of this fluctuation contribution suppresses the entropy @xmath68 , the specific heat @xmath0 is enhanced near @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](b ) .",
    "such a fluctuation effect on the entropy @xmath6 is , however , suppressed in the strong - coupling bec regime , because metastable preformed cooper pairs are replaced by stable tightly bound molecules with a finite binding energy@xcite @xmath69 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] . )",
    "this is the reason for the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath70 with respect to the interaction strength seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](b ) .    in the strong - coupling bec regime ,",
    "the system is well described by a gas of @xmath71 tightly bound molecules with the molecular mass @xmath61 . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 increases with decreasing the temperature near @xmath2 when @xmath72 , as in the case of an ideal bose gas ( although we do not explicitly show this in this paper ) . in the bec limit , @xmath70 just equals the specific heat @xmath73 of an ideal molecular bose gas at the bec phase transition temperature@xcite .",
    "to summarise , motivated by the prospective usefulness of the specific heat @xmath0 as a probe to study effects of strong pairing fluctuations in an ultracold fermi gas , we have discussed strong coupling corrections to this thermodynamic quantity in the bcs - bec crossover region . within the framework of the strong - coupling theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink , we showed that @xmath0 is enhanced in the unitary regime near @xmath2 .",
    "we also showed that this anomalous enhancement is sufficient to explain the recent experiment on a @xmath1li unitary fermi gas , where the observed specific heat is amplified with decreasing the temperature near @xmath2 .",
    "although this behaviour looks similar to the @xmath3-structure of the temperature dependence of the specific heat in a liquid @xmath4he near the superfluid phase transition temperature , we pointed out that the origin of the former is fundamentally different from the latter .",
    "indeed , we found that there are no stable preformed cooper pairs at the unitarity , which is quite different from the latter case , where @xmath4he atoms are always stable .",
    "instead , the bosonic character of a unitary fermi gas near @xmath2 is dominated by the increase of metastable preformed pairs as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this naturally suppresses the entropy near @xmath2 , leading to the amplification of @xmath74 .",
    "our result indicates that the anomalous amplification of the specific heat observed in a @xmath1li unitary fermi gas can be fully explained by fluctuating fermi pairs , without the inclusion of stable bosons .    in this paper",
    ", we have only treated the normal state . since the specific heat has also been observed in the superfluid phase , it is important to extend the present theory to the region below @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , since a real fermi gas is trapped in a harmonic potential , effects of spatial inhomogeneity on the specific heat is also a crucial future problem .",
    "since the specific heat is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity , our results would contribute to the further understanding of thermodynamic properties of an ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
