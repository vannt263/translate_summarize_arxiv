    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are nowadays more and more popular in scientific applications , especially in those fields of material science involving nanotechnology and advanced material design .",
    "on one side , there are advantages in the speed and accuracy of the simulations , with the model of the potential for atomic interactions being optimized to reproduce either experimental values or quantities extimated by first principles calculations ( considered , as a matter of facts , just like experimental results ) . on the other side , it is more and more frequent to use commercial or open - access codes implementing off - the - shelf potential models , and use them as a black box , without having a precise feeling with the code itself .",
    "one of the most used simulator is lammps ( large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator ) , able to implement several interatomic potentials . by using an analytical discrete mechanical model , we present a benchmark for the equilibrium problem of graphene and carbon nanotubes , which can be applied to any kind of rebo ( reactive empirical bond - order ) potential .",
    "the analytical condition proposed produces results in complete agreement with first principles , density functional theory and monte carlo simulations . with the aid of this benchmark",
    ", we show that lammps code , when implemented with the second generation brenner potential , produces results which are offset from those of the benchmark by a significant amount , and provide evidence of the reason . the purpose of this letter it is not to just to supply a test for the lammps code , rather , it is to provide a general tool for testing any md code .",
    "the benchmark solution we propose has been developed within the context of carbon macromolecules , such as flat graphene strips ( fgss ) or carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) .",
    "when regarded from the point of view of md , such aggregates are modelled as sets of mass points , whose configuration is described by the cartesian coordinates of each point with respect to a chosen reference frame ; each point is then interacting with the others  at least with the closest ones  and the interaction is captured by a suitable empirical potential , whose shape and parameters are fitted with a set of selected experiments and _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the last generation potentials usually take into account multi - particle interactions , up to the third nearest neighbor , which is indispensable to capture the mechanics of complex systems , such as carbon macromolecules .    in order to provide an easy - to - visualize mechanical picture ,",
    "the perspective we here adopt is not the one of md , we consider instead the approach of favata _ _ et al.__@xcite , where a discrete mechanical model is detailed for 2d carbon allotropes . in this view",
    ", the configuration of a molecular aggregate is not identified by the coordinates of the mass points , but rather by a suitable finite list of order parameters . in particular , the conditions of _ natural equilibrium _ of the aggregate can be determined and expressed in terms of such list and independently of the choice of the rebo potential .",
    "as we will see , the prediction of such equations are in total agreement with first principles , density functional theory and monte carlo simulations ; moreover , given their generality , they can be exploited to establish benchmark solutions .    in order to understand the physical meaning of the conditions we propose , we summarize some of the results of favata _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite . starting with the geometry , with reference to fig .",
    "[ rectangle ] , let the axes 1 and 2 be respectively aligned with the armchair and zigzag directions , and let @xmath0 be the number of hexagonal cells counted along these axes .",
    "let us consider now the representative cell @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the sides @xmath2 and @xmath3 are aligned with the axis 1 ; the common length of corresponding bonds will be denoted by @xmath4 , and we will call _ a - type _ the corresponding bonds .",
    "we see that the other four sides have equal length @xmath5 ( _ b - type bonds _ ) .",
    "we pass to introduce the _ bond angles _ and , since we intend to consider interactions up to the third neighbor , the _",
    "dihedral angles_. as to the bond angles , we notice that they can be of _ @xmath6-type _ and _ @xmath7-type _ ( e.g. , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; see fig .",
    "[ rectangle ] ) . as to the dihedral angles ,",
    "there are five types @xmath10 , which can be identified with the help of the colored bond chains in fig .",
    "[ rectangle ] . in conclusion , to determine the deformed configuration of a representative hexagonal cell , no matter if that cell belongs to a fgs or to an achiral cnt , we need to determine the 9-entry _ order - parameter substring _ : @xmath11 the complete order - parameter string for the whole molecular aggregate can be obtained by sequential juxtaposition of substrings .        due to",
    "the geometric compatibility conditions induced by the built - in symmetry ( see favata _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite for details ) , only three of the nine kinematic variables determine the natural configuration , which are chosen to be @xmath12 and @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , by distinguishing the armchair ( superscript a ) from the zigzag ( superscript z ) case , the order - parameter substring are given by , respectively : @xmath13 the explicit form of the functions @xmath14 is given in favata _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite in , @xmath15 is the angle between the plane of @xmath16 and the plane of @xmath17 when an armchair cnt is considered , and @xmath18 the angle between the planes of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , when a zigzag cnt up is considered . in case of a fgs",
    ", we have @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    ".    the equilibrium equations turn out to be the following ones :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , are the so - called _ nanostresses _ , work - conjugate to changes of , respectively , bond lengths , bond angles , and dihedral angles of each type considered .",
    "the form of the third of depends on which of the two achiral cnts is dealt with ; more precisely , we have that @xmath27 due to their generality , the conditions may serve as a benchmark for any rebo potential . to express the equilibrium equations in terms of the lagrangian",
    "coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath6 , it is necessary to introduce the constitutive equations for the stress , which result from the assignment of an intermolecular potential . in the next section ,",
    "we detail the formulas in the brenner 2nd generation rebo potential @xcite which are needed to solve in terms of the order parameters .",
    "in the brenner 2nd generation rebo potential , the binding energy @xmath28 of a molecular aggregate is written as a sum over nearest neighbors : @xmath29 the interatomic potential @xmath30 is given by the construct @xmath31 where the individual effects of the _ repulsion _ and _ attraction functions _ @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which model pair - wise interactions of atoms @xmath34 and @xmath35 depending on their distance @xmath36 , are modulated by the _ bond - order function _ @xmath37 .",
    "the repulsion and attraction functions have the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a _ cutoff function _ limiting the range of covalent interactions to nearest neighbors , and where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , are parameters to be chosen fit to a material - specific dataset .",
    "the remaining ingredient in is the _ bond - order function _ :",
    "@xmath45 where superscripts @xmath46 and @xmath47 refer to two types of bonds : the strong covalent @xmath46-bonds , between atoms in the same plane , and the @xmath47-bonds , which are perpendicular to the plane of @xmath46-bonds .",
    "we now describe the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the role of function @xmath48 is to account for the local coordination of , and the bond angles relative to , atoms @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ; its form is : @xmath50 here , for each fixed pair of indices @xmath51 , ( a ) the cutoff function @xmath52 limits the interactions of atom @xmath34 to those with its nearest neighbors ; ( b ) @xmath53 is a string of parameters designed to prevent attraction in some specific situations ; ( c ) function @xmath54 depends on @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the numbers of @xmath57 and @xmath58 atoms that are nearest neighbors of atom @xmath34 , and is meant to adjust the bond - order function according to the specific environment of the c atoms in one or another molecule ; ( d ) according to brenner et al.@xcite , for solid - state carbon , the values of both the string @xmath53 and the function @xmath54 are taken null .",
    "finally , function @xmath59 modulates the contribution of each nearest neighbor in terms of the cosine of the angle between the @xmath60 and @xmath61 bonds ; its analytic form is given by three six - order polynomial splines in @xmath62 , each of them defined in an interval of the bond angle @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding coefficients are determined by fitting each polynomial spline to the values of @xmath64 at certain values of @xmath63 .",
    "function @xmath49 is given a split representation : @xmath65 the first addendum depends on whether the bond between atoms @xmath34 and @xmath35 has a radical character and on whether it is part of a conjugated system , the second depends on dihedral angles .",
    "function @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where function @xmath68 is a tricubic spline depending on @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , a function of local conjugation , while @xmath72 is the diedral angle between the planes of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "when the point of view described in sect .",
    "[ model ] is assumed , the expressions of the potentials have to be specialized and written in terms of the order parameters in the substrings .",
    "on introducing the potentials @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the _",
    "a- _ and _ b_-type bonds , we have , respectively :    @xmath77    ( see favata _ _ et al.__@xcite for details ) .",
    "once this has been done , the nanostresses entering the balance equations can be expressed in terms of the order parameters by means of the following constitutive relations : @xmath78",
    "the most direct outcomes of our solution are natural geometry and energy , which can be used to check the correctness of whatever md code .",
    "the results obtained by solving equations with brenner 2nd generation potential are in good agreement with first principles , density functional theory ( dft ) and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) simulations , as tables [ tab : r : comparisonen ] and [ tab : r : comparison ] show . as an application of the possibility of exploiting as a benchmark , we present in table [ tab : r ] the radii of a number of cnts , showing that standard lammps code underestimates them . in table",
    "[ tab : cohesive ] the values of the cohesive energy from our solution and those obtained with the use of lammps code when adopting the 2nd - generation brenner potential are presented ; it can be seen that there is a remarkable difference : the cohesive energy is highly overestimated and our benchmark makes evident that the code in its current implementation definitely produces results which are offset from those of the benchmark . the origin of the discrepancies can be found only by a close inspection of lammps source code .",
    "in fact , although in brenner _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite it is indicated that the values of the function @xmath54 should be taken null for solid - state carbon , the code assigns the value 0.027603 .",
    "this latter value is actually dictated in table viii of stuart _ _ et al.__@xcite for airebo potentials , due to the additional terms included in this potential .",
    "whenever a lammps user wants to adopt rebo potentials , he needs to change the hard - wired number for the variable pccf[2][0 ] in `` pair_airebo.cpp '' ; unfortunately , the lammps manual does not provide any information on this issue , and most studies based on lammps rebo calculations are likely to have underestimation or overestimation of mechanical and geometrical properties presented in our tables .",
    "an example of the use of lammps with 2nd generation brenner potential is zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite . when the value assigned in brenner _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite is implemented",
    ", the lammps code produces the same results as the benchmark solution , letting alone a tiny difference due to numerical effects , as the third column of tables [ tab : r ] and [ tab : cohesive ] undeniably makes evident .    starting from the geometry and the energy gathered by means of",
    ", it is possible to obtain secondary quantities . in table",
    "[ tab : young ] and [ tab : poisson ] the young moduli and the poisson coefficients are reported : the standard lammps code overestimates the former and underestimates the latter .",
    "our results are in very good agreement with the literature ( see e.g. agrawal _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "the differences between our benchmark and the lammps code with modified parameters are ascribable to numerical effects , more accentuated because young modulus and poisson coefficients are quantities not directly evaluated , but rather derived , and an increment of numerical error is foreseeable .",
