    "in axiomatizing physical theories , we follow in the footsteps of many great predecessors .",
    "logical axiomatization of physics , especially that of relativity theory , is not at all a new idea .",
    "it goes back to such leading mathematicians and philosophers as hilbert , g \" odel , tarski , reichenbach , carnap , suppes and friedman .",
    "it also has an extensive literature , see , e.g. , the references of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our aims go beyond these approaches , because we not only axiomatize relativity theories , but also analyze their logical and conceptual structures .",
    "there are many examples showing the benefits of using the axiomatic method in the foundations of mathematics .",
    "the success story of the axiomatic method in the foundations of mathematics suggests that it is worth to apply this method in the foundations of spacetime theories .    for good reasons",
    ", foundations of mathematics was carried through strictly within first - order logic ( fol ) .",
    "for the same reasons , foundations of spacetime theories are best developed within fol .",
    "for example , in any foundational work it is essential to avoid tacit assumptions , and one acknowledged feature of using fol is that it helps to eliminate tacit assumptions .",
    "that is only one of the many reasons why we work within fol . for further reasons ,",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  why fol ? ) , @xcite .    in physics , the same way as in mathematics",
    ", we do not address the question whether the axioms are true or not , we just postulate them .",
    "the reason for this in mathematics is that we want to give a tool that is usable in all applications where the axioms are true .",
    "however , in physics the statements of the theories are closely related to the real physical world , thus the application area is fixed in a way .",
    "therefore , the role of the axioms ( the role of statements that we assume without proofs ) in physics is more fundamental than in mathematics .",
    "that is why we aim to formulate simple , logically transparent and intuitively convincing axioms .",
    "all the surprising or unusual predictions of a physical theory should be provable as theorems and not assumed as axioms .",
    "for example , the prediction `` no observer can move faster than light '' is a theorem in our approach and not an axiom , see theorem  [ noftl - thm ] .    some of the questions we study when investigating the logical structure of relativity theories are :  what is believed and why ?  which axioms are responsible for certain predictions ?  what happens if we discard some axioms ? ",
    "can we change the axioms and at what price ?",
    "first - order logic can be viewed as a fragment of natural language with unambiguous syntax and semantics .",
    "being a _ fragment of natural language _ is useful in our project because one of our aims is to make relativity theory accessible to a broad audience . _ unambiguous syntax and semantics _",
    "are important for the same reason , because they make it possible for the reader to always know what is stated and what is not stated by the axioms .",
    "therefore they can use the axioms without being familiar with all the tacit assumptions and rules of thumb of physics ( that one usually learns via many , many years of practice ) .",
    "a novelty in this paper is that we concentrate on the transition from special relativity to general relativity , we try to keep this transition logically transparent and illuminating for the non - specialist .",
    "we are going to `` derive '' the axioms of general relativity from those of special relativity in two natural steps . in the first step",
    "we will extend our fol axiom system of special relativity of inertial observers to accelerated observers .",
    "this step will provide us a fol theory of accelerated observers , which implies the usual predictions about them , such as the twin paradox , see theorem  [ thm - twp ] . in the second step we will eliminate the difference between inertial and noninertial observers on the level of axioms . by these two natural steps",
    ", we will get a fol axiomatization of the spacetimes of _ general relativity _",
    "suitable for further study .",
    "all these three theories ( special relativity , theory of accelerated observers , general relativity ) will be formulated in the same streamlined fol language .",
    "the first important decision in writing up an axiom system in fol is to choose the vocabulary ( set of basic symbols ) of our language , i.e. , what objects and relations between them we will use as basic concepts .",
    "we will have to stick to this language while writing up the axioms and investigating our theory .",
    "however , later we can change the vocabulary of our language , and we can write up a new theory ( or a new version of our theory ) in this new language",
    ". then we can investigate the logical connections between these theories built up in different fol languages . this way we can investigate",
    "the role of having chosen the particular basic concepts of our theory , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* second half of  3 ) .    in this paper",
    "we will use the following two - sorted fol language : @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( bodies ) and @xmath2 ( quantities ) are the two sorts , @xmath3 ( inertial bodies ) and @xmath4 ( light signals or photons ) are one - place relation symbols of sort @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two - place function symbols of sort @xmath2 , and @xmath7 ( the worldview relation ) is a @xmath8-place relation symbol the first two arguments of which are of sort @xmath1 and the rest are of sort @xmath2 .",
    "atomic formulas @xmath9 and @xmath10 are translated as `` _",
    "_ @xmath11 is an inertial body _ _ , '' and `` _ _",
    "@xmath12 is a photon _ _ , '' respectively .",
    "we use the worldview relation @xmath7 to speak about coordinatization by translating @xmath13 as `` _ _ body @xmath14 coordinatizes body @xmath11 at space - time location @xmath15 _ _ , '' ( i.e. , at space location @xmath16 and at instant @xmath17 ) .",
    "sometimes we use the more picturesque expressions _ sees _ or _ observes _ for coordinatizes . however , these `` seeing '' and `` observing '' have nothing to do with visual seeing or observing they only mean associating coordinate points to bodies .",
    "the above , together with statements of the form @xmath18 ( read as _ @xmath19 equals @xmath20 _ ) are the so - called _ atomic formulas _ of our fol language , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be arbitrary variables of the same sort , or terms built up from variables of sort @xmath21  by using the two - place operations @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",

    "our two remaining axioms are simplifying ones .",
    "we could leave them out without losing the essence of our theory , only the formalizations of the theorems would become much more complicated .    *",

    "this theorem says that in the models of @xmath186 the worldlines of _ inertial _ observers are timelike geodesics in the above sense .",
    "according to the definition above , if there are only a few observers , then it is not a big deal that the worldline of @xmath33 is a time - like geodesic ( it is easy to be maximal if there are only a few to be compared to ) . to generate a real competition for the rank of having a timelike geodesic worldline",
    ", we postulate the existence of many observers by the following axiom scheme of comprehension .        the assumption of axiom schema @xmath226 guarantees that our definition of geodesic coincides with that of the literature on lorentzian manifolds .",
