    "chaos in classical hamiltonian systems , most simply thought of as the extreme sensitivity of trajectories in phase space to initial conditions , making long term predictions extremely difficult , is by now broadly understood @xcite .",
    "more recently , the field of quantum chaos , for our purpose meaning the study of quantum mechanical equivalents of classical chaotic systems , has been the subject of much investigation @xcite . from this",
    "it does seem that the dynamics of quantum mechanical systems can be divided into regular and irregular subsets , with distinct differences between the two , just as is the case in classical mechanics .",
    "for example , due to the unitarity of the evolution of the state vector , there can be no equivalent of sensitivity to initial conditions in the hilbert space , but there appears to be an equivalent sensitivity to perturbation which distinguishes quantum chaotic motion @xcite .",
    "a certain amount of understanding has thus been achieved , although there are still unresolved problems , in particular how to extract classical chaos from quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "quantum dynamics are determined by the schrdinger equation .",
    "a seemingly natural extension is to ask what happens when we take a quantum chaotic schrdinger equation , and add some kind of nonlinearity .",
    "this is something which has been much less studied @xcite , and is certainly of more than academic interest ; such equations do appear in nature , for example the gross - pitaevskii equation in the field of bose - einstein condensation @xcite , and also in the field of nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "there are thus experimentally accessible systems in which such chaotic effects may manifest themselves .",
    "it is also interesting to note that just as in the case of quantum mechanics , where if one takes the limit @xmath0 one expects to regain classical dynamics , one can also carry out this limit for nonlinear schrdinger equations .",
    "this produces equations reminiscent of classical hydrodynamics , an interpretation also extensively used in the theoretical study of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "this interconnection of different kinds of dynamics is displayed schematically in fig .",
    "( [ connections ] ) .",
    "we will firstly be concerned with effective `` single particle '' systems .",
    "that is to say , where one takes a linear single particle schrdinger equation with a potential which is known to produce chaotic dynamics in hamilton s equations of motion , and adds a nonlinearity to it .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( for example ) describes the collective dynamics of huge numbers of particles , but may nevertheless be thought of as an effective single particle wave equation .",
    "we later consider corrections to this interpretation , taking into account more fully the many body dynamics .",
    "it is thus of general interest to determine how effects of classical chaos and quantum chaos manifest themselves in the dynamics of nonlinear schrdinger equations , and to what extent the dynamics of the nonlinear schrdinger equation can be explained by motion in the hydrodynamic limit , as determined by the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "in this paper we will consider explicitly only one dimensional systems , although the analytic results presented can easily be generalized to two or three spatial dimensions . to simplify things further",
    ", we consider only the cubic nonlinearity explicitly , the simplest nonlinearity possible , resulting in the one dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation , well known in the context of bose - einstein condensation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wavefunction and @xmath3 the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "again , the analytic results here can easily be generalized to more complicated nonlinearities .",
    "such a simplified system demonstrates all the main features of a nonlinear schrdinger equation , and is perfectly adequate for illustrative purposes .",
    "this kind of simplified system is in fact experimentally accessible , for example in a bose - einstein condensate experiment , as will be shown in section [ physicalmodel ] .",

    "generally some appropriate parameter presents itself , as will be shown in the model we present in section [ model ] , and expansions where it is stated that the limit @xmath0 is explored should be interpreted in this manner .",

    "if @xmath3 is large we would generally expect large numbers of such particles concentrated heavily in some cell in position space to tend to drive one another apart , meaning that large values of @xmath4 should in the long term be heavily disfavoured .",
    "hydrodynamic equations can also be derived from the equation of motion for the wigner function eq .",

    "it is necessary to kill off all the quantum corrections , but there is in fact a much more drastic approximation than only taking the limit @xmath0 , as a whole chain of classical corrections must be abandoned at the same time .",
    "the reason for the failure of the hydrodynamic equations as a semiclassical limit can be seen by examining our initial reasoning more closely .",
    "this was based partly on a correspondence between the hydrodynamic limit of the linear schrdinger equation and the equivalent hamilton - jacobi equation , however this also implicitly assumes that the _ interpretation _ of the quantum wavefunction tends to a classical _ point_. the liouville dynamics given by eqs .",
    "( [ singleliouville],[liouville ] ) describe the motion of classical _ distributions_. as has already been mentioned , in the case of no nonlinearity ( @xmath14 ) one can connect the two classical cases by considering a distribution of the form @xmath47 , but when one is considering a case where the dynamics are influenced by the density in position space @xmath4 , this is clearly meaningless .",

    "after this initial explosion through phase space ( actively encouraged in the unstable parts of phase space ) the contribution by the density to the effective potential is small , and so the by now thinly spread distribution undergoes local dynamics equivalent to single noninteracting classical particles , chaotic or stable , depending on the location in phase space .",

    "as is shown in appendix [ antilocalapp ] , in the case of linear schrdinger equation dynamics , the floquet eigenstates are highly delocalized , due to extra symmetries connected to the fact that the wavefunction is kicked exactly six times per oscillation period .",
    "the presence of delocalized eigenstates means that the wavefunction tends to spread throughout phase space with ease ; along the stochastic web if the initial condition is in a classically unstable part of phase space , and possibly by tunneling from cell to cell ( promoted by large @xmath56 ) if the wavefunction is initially in a stable part of phase space . with increasing @xmath59",
