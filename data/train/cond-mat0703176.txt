    "the landau levels of 2deg with a pure rashba coupling in the absence of an electric field was obtained over fourty years ago by rashba , and studied by a lot of authors.@xcite the landau levels of 2deg with a pure dresselhaus coupling can be obtained by symmetry as discussed in the last subsection . however , the problem becomes more complicated in a system with both the rashba and dresselhous couplings .",
    "the truncation and the perturbation approximations have been applied to study the system and the response to an electric field@xcite .",
    "this problem has recently been solved by d. zhang@xcite . by introducing two boson operators and using a unitary transformation ,",
    "an exact solution can be expressed as an infinite series in terms of the free landau levels and other parameters . suing the result obtained from the exact solution",
    "it was confirmed that a crossing between the energy eigenstates occur for larger rashba coupling , and the degeneracy may lead to the resonant spin hall conductance , which is consistent with the results obtained by using the perturbation theory and truncation approximation.shen04prl,shen05prb,bao05prb      the electronic structure of hole - doped systems near the @xmath77 point is well described by the luttinger hamiltonian @xmath78where @xmath79 is the total angular momemtun operator of @xmath80 .",
    "if the system breaks also the bulk inversion symmetry , a rashba term @xmath81 may be included in @xmath82 .",
    "the rashab term introduces an energy splitting of the heavy holes in the 2-dimesnions , and is reduced to the form of the so - called cubic rashba term , @xmath83 . in the presence of a perpendicular magentic field , both the luttinger model and cubic rashba model can be solved analytically .",
    "recently , zarea and ulloa@xcite , and ma and liu@xcite have obtained exact solutions in two dimension , and used the kubo - greenwood formula to calculate the spin hall conductance . neglecting the zeeman splitting , they found that the spin hall conductance approaches to @xmath84 in the limit of a weak magnetic field and low density of carriers , consistent with the result at the zero field .",
    "this is in contrast to the linear rashba coupling model of @xmath85 , where the spin hall conductance vanishes in the absence of the zeeman coupling .",
    "@xcite when the zeeman splitting is taken into account in the cubic rashba system , it was found that a resonant spin hall effect may occur when the fermi surface acrosses through the crossing point of the spectra as the magnetic field decreases.@xcite",
    "it was well known that the edge state provides an alternative approach to understand the quantum hall effect in 2deg . here",
    "we discuss the edge spin current and the resonant spin hall effect in the rashba system described by @xmath86 with a periodic boundary condition in the @xmath10 direction and two edges along the @xmath87 direction .",
    "the velocity operator in the hilbert subspace of @xmath88 can be written as @xmath89 and thus the spin current operator @xmath90following the works by laughlin,@xcite halperin halperin82prb and macdonald and streda @xcite the  total spin hall current in the filled landau level ( @xmath91 ) can be expressed asbao05prb @xmath92where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the energy spectrum . without the spin - orbit coupling the energy eigenstate satisfies",
    "@xmath95 so that @xmath96which is only determined by the difference of charge voltage at the two edges , @xmath97similar to the case for the charge hall currentlaughlin81prb , halperin82prb , the inclusion of impurities and coulomb interactions in the hamiltonian does not affect the above result .",
    "the spin hall conductance displays a series of plateaus in the quantum hall regime , @xmath98corresponding to the quantum hall conductance , @xmath99 in the presence of spin - orbit coupling the states with different spins will be mixed together , and the spin gradually deviates from the @xmath100- to @xmath101-direction and the spin hall conductance varies with the effective rashba coupling or magnetic field through tuning the energy gap between the two states especially near the fermi level .",
    "the total spin hall conductance can be calculated numerically as a function of @xmath102 for a fixed chemical potential _  assuming that the voltage drops only near the edges",
    "hence the bulk state does not contribute to the total spin hall current_. the charge hall conductance is found to be quantized as expected , and the spin hall conductance is of the order of @xmath103 or @xmath104  @xmath105 depending on if odd or even number of landau levels are occupied .",
    "the spin hall conductance is a function of the effective spin - orbit coupling , which varies with the magnetic field .",
    "the resonant peak appears only when the two degenerate bulk landau levels crosses over a special value of chemical potential with decreasing the magnetic field .",
    "the spin hall conductance for a fixed density of charge carriers can be abstratced from the results for a fixed chemical potential if @xmath106 .",
    "the values of the spin hall conductance are consistent with the bulk theory for the fully filled landau levels.@xcite",
    "in this section we discuss an exact relation between the spin hall current and spin polarization and the effect of the disorder to the resonant spin hall effect .",
    "we briefly discuss the future experimental serach of the resonant spin hall effect .      for a rashba system described by @xmath85 at @xmath107",
    ", it is now agreed that the spin hall conductance vanishes when the disorder effect is taken into account@xcite .",
    "this may be understood by calculating the commutator @xmath108/i\\hbar   \\notag \\\\ & = & -\\left ( 4m\\beta ^{2}/\\hbar \\right ) j_{x}^{z}-g_{s}\\mu _ { b}b\\sigma _ { y}/\\hbar .\\end{aligned}\\]]note that the above relation remains valid in the presence of non - magnetic disorder . in a steady state",
    "the expectation value of @xmath109 should vanish , and we see immediately from the above relation that the spin hall current vanishes in 2deg described by a linear rashba coupling in the absence of magnetic field b.@xcite this can also be understood from the point of view of spin force as examined by shen@xcite and by jin et al . @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman exchange coupling induce a spin force , which contains two parts : the transverse force on a moving electron spin , @xmath110 ,  with @xmath111 the spin current tensor component carried by the electron , and a spin force within the plane induced by the zeeman exchange coupling .",
    "the latter is relevant to the spin polarization , @xmath112 .$ ] if the disorder potential @xmath113 is taken into account , in a steady state , the spin force must reach at balance , @xmath114 \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\mathbf{f}+\\mathbf{g}\\right\\rangle = 0,\\]]where @xmath115 is the spin gauge vector potential caused by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this result is independent of the non - magnetic disorder and interaction because the spin gauge field commutes with non - magnetic potential @xmath113 . in this way we have established a relation between spin current and spin polarization ,",
    "@xmath116it becomes clear that the spin hall current vanishes in the case of @xmath107 or @xmath117 , which is consistent with previous results based on the vertex correction calculations or non - equilibrium green s function calculations.@xcite note that the extrinsic or disorder contributions are implicitly included in discussion of the spin force since it is required to reach the balance or equilibrium for the system .",
    "the effects of disorder in 2deg with rashba coupling in a strong magnetic field is not well understood at present .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to assume that the spin - orbit coupling does not change the effects of disorder qualitatively .",
    "the strong magnetic field ensures extended states in the landau levels when the disorder is not sufficiently strong as evidenced by the experimentally observed quantization of the charge hall conductance .",
    "one may assume that the disorder gives rise to broadening of the landau level so that the extended states in a landau levels are separated in energy from those in the next one by localized states .",
    "inspection of the spin - orbit coupling shows that laughlin s gauge argument still holdslaughlin81prb , halperin82prb , and each landau level with its extended states completely filled contributes an amount of @xmath118 to the charge hall conductance .",
    "thus one may conclude that the quantum hall conductance remains intact with the spin - orbit interaction , except at the special degeneracy point.@xcite    the disorder effect may be studied by numerical methods .",
    "recently bao and shen@xcite used the exact solutions of 2deg in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling and the disorder as the base function to numerically solve the single particle problem by a truncation approximation .",
    "they considered a short - range disorder potential @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is distributed randomly in finite size of the system .",
    "they found that the impurity scattering tends to suppress the spin hall conductance .",
    "however , if the disorder is not so strong the resonance remains intact .",
    "as we discussed in this brief review , the theoretical studies predict a resonant spin hall effect in two - dimensional electron or hole systems with spin - orbit coupling in a strong magnetic field and at low temperatures .",
    "it is likely due to the difficulty in detecting the spin current in these extreme conditions that no experiments have been carried out to observe the resonant effect .",
    "it is our view that the resonance should be measurable .",
    "the most promising way to observe the effect is to detect the spin polarization or the spin susceptibility .",
    "as we discussed in section iv b , the spin polarization is proportional to the spin hall current .",
    "the resonant effect may be best observed in the rapid change of the direction of spin polarization as magnetic field sweeps through the resonant field in the rashba sytems .",
    "since the change of the spin polarization in the system only occurs at the landau levels near the fermi energy , the effect will be most pronounced if the resonance occurs at the lower landau levels .",
