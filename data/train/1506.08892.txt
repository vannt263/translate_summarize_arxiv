    "the business of quantum state tomography is converting multiple copies of an unknown quantum state into an estimate of that state by performing measurements on the copies .",
    "the nave approach to the problem involves measuring different observables ( represented by hermitian operators ) on each copy of the state and constructing the estimate as a function of the measurement outcomes ( corresponding to different eigenvalues of the observables ) .",
    "though tomography can be performed in such a way , there are more general ways of interrogating the ensemble ; indeed , generalizations such as ancilla - coupled  @xcite and joint  @xcite measurements lead one to evaluate the problem of tomography from the perspective of _ generalized measurements _",

    "[ sec : weak - tomo ] ) seeks to outperform so - called `` standard '' tomography by exploiting the small system disturbance caused by weak measurements to recycle the system for further measurement  @xcite .",
    "here we present our criteria for evaluating claims about the importance of weak measurements for quantum state tomography .",
    "the primary tool we utilize is generalized measurement theory , specifically , describing a measurement by a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "a povm assigns a positive operator @xmath7 to every measurable subset @xmath8 of the set @xmath9 of measurement outcomes @xmath10 . for countable sets of outcomes ,",
    "this means the measurement is described by the countable set of positive operators , @xmath11 the positive operators @xmath7 are then given by the sums @xmath12 for continuous sets of outcomes the positive operator associated with a particular measurable subset @xmath8 is given by the integral @xmath13 these positive operators capture all the statistical properties of a given measurement , in that the probability of obtaining a measurement result @xmath14 within a measurable subset @xmath15 for a particular state @xmath16 is given by the formula @xmath17 that each measurement yields some result is equivalent to the completeness condition , @xmath18    povms are ideal representations of tomographic measurements because they contain all the information relevant for tomography , i.e. , measurement statistics , while removing many irrelevant implementation details .",
    "if two wildly different measurement protocols reduce to the same povm , their tomographic performances are .",
    "the authors of both schemes we evaluate make claims about the novelty of their approach .",
    "these claims seem difficult to substantiate , since no tomographic protocol within the framework of quantum theory falls outside the well - studied set of tomographic protocols employing generalized measurements . to avoid trivially dismissing claims in this way , however , we define a relatively conservative subset of measurements that might be considered `` basic '' and ask if the proposed schemes fall outside of this category .",
    "the subset of measurements we choose is composed of randomly chosen one - dimensional orthogonal projective measurements [ hereafter referred to as _ random odops _ ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : random - odop - limits](a ) ] .",
    "these are the measurements that can be performed using only traditional von neumann measurements , given that the experimenter is allowed to choose randomly the observable he wants to measure .",
    "this is quite a restriction on the full set of measurements allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "many interesting measurements , such as symmetric informationally complete povms , like the tetrahedron measurement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : random - odop - limits](b ) , can not be realized in such a way . with odops assumed as basic , however ,",
    "if the povm generated by a particular weak - measurement scheme is a random odop , we conclude that weak measurements should not be thought of as an essential ingredient for the scheme .",
    "identifying other subsets of povms as `` basic '' might yield other interesting lines of inquiry .",
    "for example , when doing tomography on ensembles of atoms , weak collective measurements might be compared with nonadaptive separable projective measurements  @xcite .",
    "users of tomographic schemes are arguably less interested in the novelty of a particular approach than they are in its performance .",
    "there is a variety of performance metrics available for state estimates , some of which have operational interpretations relevant for particular applications .",
    "given that we have no particular application in mind , we adopt a reasonable figure of merit , haar - invariant average fidelity , which fortuitously is the figure of merit already used to analyze the scheme we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak - tomo ] .",
    "this is the fidelity , @xmath19 , of the estimated state @xmath20 with the true state @xmath16 , averaged over possible measurement records @xmath14 and further averaged over the unitarily invariant ( maximally uninformed ) prior distribution over pure true states . for the case of discrete measurement outcomes",
    ", this quantity is written as @xmath21    an obvious problem with this figure of merit is its dependence on the estimator @xmath22 .",
    "we want to compare measurement schemes directly , not measurement  estimator pairs . to remove this dependence",
    "we should calculate the average fidelity with the optimal estimator for each measurement , expressed as @xmath23    to avoid straw - man arguments , it is also important to compare the performance of a particular tomographic protocol to the optimal protocol , or at least the best known protocol . both proposals we review in this paper are nonadaptive measurements on each copy of the system individually .",
    "since there are practical reasons for restricting to this class of measurements , we compare to the optimal protocol subject to this constraint .",
    "this brings up an interesting point that can be made before looking at any of the details of the weak - measurement proposals . for our chosen figure of merit ,",
    "the optimal individual nonadaptive measurement is a random odop ( specifically the haar - invariant measurement , which samples a measurement basis from a uniform distribution of bases according to the haar measure ) .",
    "therefore , weak - measurement schemes can not hope to do better than random odops , and even if they are able to attain optimal performance , weak measurements are clearly not an essential ingredient for attaining that performance .",
    "many proposals for weak - measurement tomography are motivated not by efficacy , but rather by a desire to address some foundational aspect of quantum mechanics .",
    "this desire offers an explanation for the attention these proposals receive in spite of the disappointing performance we find when they are compared to random odops .",
    "there are two prominent claims of foundational significance .",
    "the first is that a measurement provides an operational interpretation of wavefunction amplitudes more satisfying than traditional interpretations .",
    "this is the motivation behind the direct state tomography of sec .",
    "[ sec : dst ] , where the measurement allegedly yields expectation values directly proportional to wavefunction amplitudes rather than their squares .",
    "the second claim is that weak measurement finds a clever way to get around the uncertainty  disturbance relations in quantum mechanics .",
    "the intuition behind using weak measurements in this pursuit is that , since weak measurements minimally disturb the system being probed , they might leave the system available for further use ; the information obtained from a subsequent measurement , together with the information acquired from the preceding weak measurements , might be more information in total than can be obtained with traditional approaches . of course , generalized measurement theory sets limits on the amount of information that can be extracted from a system , suggesting that such a foundational claim is unfounded .",
    "we more fully evaluate this claim in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak - tomo ] .",
    "in  @xcite and  @xcite lundeen _ et al . _  propose a measurement technique designed to provide an operational interpretation of wavefunction amplitudes .",
    "they make various claims about the measurement , including its ability to make `` the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly '' on their measurement device , the absence of a requirement for global reconstruction since `` states can be determined locally , point by point , '' and the potential to `` characterize quantum states _ in situ _  without disturbing the process in which they feature . ''",
    "the protocol is thus often characterized as _ direct state tomography _ ( dst ) .",
    "to evaluate these claims , we apply the principles discussed in sec .  [ sec : eval - princ ] .",
    "lundeen _ et al .",
    "_  have outlined procedures for both pure and mixed states .",
    "we focus on the pure - state problem for simplicity , although much of what we identify is directly applicable to mixed - state . to construct the povm , we need to describe the measurement in detail .",
    "the original proposal for dst of lundeen _ et al . _",
    "calls for a continuous meter for performing the weak measurements .",
    "as shown by maccone and rusconi  @xcite , the continuous meter can be replaced by a qubit meter prepared in the positive @xmath24 eigenstate @xmath25 , a replacement we adopt to simplify the analysis . since wavefunction amplitudes are basis - dependent quantities , it is necessary to specify the basis in which we want to reconstruct the wavefunction .",
    "we call this the _ reconstruction basis _ and denote it by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dimension of the system we are reconstructing .",
    "the meter is coupled to the system via one of a collection of interaction unitaries @xmath28 , where @xmath29 the strength of the interaction is parametrized by @xmath30 . a weak interaction , i.e. , one for which @xmath31 , followed by measuring either @xmath32 or @xmath33 on the meter , effects a weak measurement of the system .",
    "in addition , after the interaction , there is a strong ( projective ) measurement directly on the system in the _ conjugate basis _",
    "@xmath34 , which is defined by @xmath35    the protocol for dst of lundeen  _ et al . _ ,",
    "motivated by thinking in terms of weak values , discards all the data except for the case when the outcome of the projective measurement is @xmath36 .",
    "this protocol is depicted as a quantum circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : dst - protocol ] .    , each of which corresponds to a reconstruction - basis element . the meter is then measured in either the @xmath37 or @xmath38 basis to obtain information about either the real or imaginary part of the wavefunction amplitude of the selected reconstruction - basis element .",
    "this procedure is postselected on obtaining the @xmath36 outcome from the measurement of the system in the conjugate basis .",
    "while the postselection is often described as producing an effect on the meter , the circuit makes clear that the measurements can be performed in either order , so it is equally valid to say the measurement of the meter produces an effect on the system . ]    for each @xmath39 , the expectation values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , conditioned on obtaining the outcome @xmath36 from the projective measurement , are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 . the probability for obtaining outcome",

    "specializing these results to weak measurements gives @xmath48 this is a remarkably simple formula for estimating the state @xmath0",
    "! there is , however , an important detail that should temper our enthusiasm .",
    "contrary to the claim in  @xcite , this formula does not allow one to reconstruct the wavefunction point - by - point ( amplitude - by - amplitude in this case of a finite - dimensional system ) , because one has no idea of the value of the `` normalization constant '' @xmath44 until _ all _ the wavefunction amplitudes have been measured .",
    "this means that while ratios of wavefunction amplitudes can be reconstructed point - by - point , reconstructing the amplitudes themselves requires a global reconstruction . admittedly , this reconstruction is simpler than commonly used linear - inversion techniques , but it comes at the price of an inherent bias in the estimator , arising from the weak - measurement approximation , as was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the scheme as it currently stands relies heavily on postselection , a procedure that often discards relevant data . to determine what information is being discarded and whether it is useful",
    ", we consider the measurement statistics of @xmath32 and @xmath33 conditioned on an arbitrary outcome @xmath49 of the strong measurement . to do that , we first introduce a unitary operator @xmath50 , diagonal in the reconstruction basis , which cyclically permutes conjugate - basis elements and puts phases on reconstruction - basis elements : @xmath51 as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : postselect ] , postselecting on outcome @xmath49 with input state @xmath0 is equivalent to postselecting on @xmath36 with input state @xmath52 .",
    "armed with this realization , we can write reconstruction formulae for all postselection outcomes , @xmath53 this makes it obvious that all the measurement outcomes in the conjugate basis give `` direct '' readings of the wavefunction in the weak - measurement limit .",
    "postselection in this case is not only harmful to the performance of the estimator , it is not even necessary for the interpretational claims of .",
    "henceforth , we drop the postselection and include all the data produced by the strong measurement .",
    "the uselessness of postselection is not a byproduct of the use of a qubit meter . in the continuous - meter case ,",
    "the conditional expectation values in the weak - measurement limit are given as weak values @xmath54 weak - value - motivated dst postselects on meter outcome @xmath55 to hold the amplitude @xmath56 constant and thus make the expectation value proportional to the wavefunction @xmath57 .",
    "since @xmath56 is only a phase , however , it is again obvious that postselecting on any value of @xmath58 gives a `` direct '' reconstruction of a rephased wavefunction .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed a variation on lundeen s protocol that requires measuring weak values of only one meter observable .",
    "this is made possible by keeping data that is discarded in the original postselection process .",
    "we now consider whether the weak measurements in dst contribute anything new to tomography .",
    "it is already clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sigmay ] ) and  ( [ eqn : sigmaz ] ) that for this protocol to provide data that is proportional to amplitudes in the reconstruction basis , the weakness of the interaction is only important for the measurement of @xmath32 . we are after something deeper than this , however , and to get at it , we change perspective on the protocol of fig .",
    "[ fig : dst - protocol ] , asking not how postselection on the result of the strong measurement affects the measurement of @xmath32 or @xmath33 , but rather how those measurements change the description of the strong measurement . as is discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dst - protocol ] , this puts the protocol on a footing that resembles that of the random odops in fig .",
    "[ fig : random - odop - limits](a ) .",
    "the measurement of @xmath33 , which provides the imaginary - part information , is trivial to analyze , because the analysis can be reduced to drawing more circuits . in fig .",
    "[ fig : imaginary - measurement](a ) , the interaction unitary is written in terms of system unitaries @xmath59 that are controlled in the @xmath38-basis of the qubit . the @xmath33 measurement on the meter commutes with the interaction unitary , so using the principle of deferred measurement , we can move this measurement through the controls , which become classical controls that use the results of the measurement .",
    "the resulting circuit , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : imaginary - measurement](b ) , shows that the imaginary part of each wavefunction amplitude can be measured by adding a phase to that amplitude , with the sign of the phase shift determined by a coin flip .",
    "this is a particular example of the random odop described by fig .",
    "[ fig : random - odop - limits](a ) .",
    "we conclude that weak measurements are not an essential ingredient for determining the imaginary parts of the wavefunction amplitudes .    measuring the real parts",
    "is more interesting , since the @xmath32 measurement does not commute with the interaction unitary .",
    "we proceed by finding the kraus operators that describe the post - measurement state of the system .",
    "the strong , projective measurement in the conjugate basis has kraus operators @xmath60 , whereas the unitary interaction @xmath61 , followed by the measurement of @xmath32 with outcome @xmath62 , has ( hermitian ) kraus operator @xmath63 where the eigenstates of @xmath32 are @xmath64 .",
    "the composite kraus operators , @xmath65 , yield povm elements @xmath66 . for each @xmath39 , these povm elements make up a rank - one povm with @xmath67 outcomes .",
    "the povm elements can productively be written as @xmath68 the povm for each @xmath39 does not fit into our framework of random odops , but can be thought of as within a wider framework of random povms .",
    "indeed , the neumark extension  @xcite teaches us how to turn any rank - one povm into an odop in a higher - dimensional hilbert space , where the dimension matches the number of outcomes of the rank - one povm .",
    "vallone and dequal  @xcite have proposed an augmentation of the original dst to obtain a `` direct '' wavefunction measurement without the need for the weak - measurement approximation .",
    "the essence of their protocol is to perform an additional @xmath24 measurement on the meter .",
    "the statistics of this measurement allow the second - order term in @xmath30 to be eliminated from the real - part calculation , giving a reconstruction formula that is exact for all values of @xmath30 .",
    "of course , the claim that the original dst protocol `` directly '' measures the wavefunction is misleading , and directness claims for vallone and dequal s modifications are necessarily more misleading",
    ". even ratios of real parts of wavefunction amplitudes no longer can be obtained by ratios of simple expectation values , since these calculations rely on both @xmath24 _ and _ @xmath32 expectation values for different measurement settings .",
    "we analyze this additional meter measurement in the same way we analyzed the @xmath32 measurement .",

    "the povm element is similar to the povm elements for the measurement of @xmath32 , but with a different modification of the @xmath39-component of the conjugate vector . for the result",
    "@xmath74 , the povm element is simply a measurement in the reconstruction basis ; as we see below , the addition of the measurement in the reconstruction basis has a profound effect on the performance of the augmented dst protocol outside the region of weak measurements , an effect unanticipated by the weak - value motivation .",
    "although claims regarding the efficacy of dst are rather nebulous , we consider the negative impact of the weak - measurement limit on tomographic performance . in",

    "the crb remains finite when the meter measurements are augmented with @xmath24 , since the resultant povm at @xmath81 then includes @xmath33 projectors on the system [ i.e. , projectors in the reconstructions basis ; see eq .",

    "our conclusions are the following .",

    "its use comes from attention to weak values , but postselection is actually a negative for tomography because it discards data that are just as cogent as the data that are retained in the weak - value scenario .",
    "second , weak measurements in this context add very little to a tomographic framework based on random odops .",
    "finally , the `` direct '' in dst is a misnomer  @xcite because the protocol does not provide point - by - point reconstruction of the wavefunction .",
    "the inability to provide point - by - point reconstruction is a symptom of a general difficulty .",
    "any procedure , classical or quantum , for detecting a complex amplitude when only absolute squares of amplitudes are measurable involves interference between two amplitudes , say , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so that some observed quantity involves a product of two amplitudes , say , @xmath97 . if one regards @xmath95 as `` known '' and chooses it to be real , then @xmath98 can be said to be observed directly .",

    "from these come the infinitesimal povm elements for outcomes @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath62 : @xmath111 these povm elements are clearly rank - one .    using the pauli algebra",
    ", we can bring the povm elements into the explicit form , @xmath112 where we have introduced a probability density and unit vectors , @xmath113 we note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the overall povm is made up of a convex combination of equally weighted pairs of orthogonal projectors and is therefore a random .",
    "from this perspective , the weak measurements are a mechanism for generating a particular distribution from which different projective measurements are sampled ; i.e. , they are a particular way of generating a distribution @xmath116 in fig .  [",
    "fig : random - odop - limits ] .",
    "several of these distributions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch - plots ] .     as a function of the number @xmath84 of system copies for three measurements : das and arvind s measurement protocol ( dotted - dashed blue ) with @xmath117 ; mub consisting of pauli @xmath24 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 measurements ( solid black ) ; random odop consisting of projective measurements sampled from the haar - uniform distribution ( dashed red ) .",
    "the dotted lines , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , are the crbs defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : crb ] ) for the optimal generalized tomographic protocol and mub measurements , respectively .",
    "]    it is interesting to note that the value of @xmath2 that das and arvind identified as optimal ( about @xmath120 ) produces a distribution that is nearly uniform over the bloch sphere .",
    "this matches our intuition when thinking of the measurement as a random odop , since the optimal random odop samples from the uniform distribution    to visualize the performance of this protocol , we again use sequential monte carlo simulations of the average fidelity .",
    "das and arvind compare their protocol to a measurement of @xmath24 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , whose eigenstates are _ mutually unbiased bases _ ( mub ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : weak - mub - haar - sim ] , we compare das and arvind s protocol for @xmath117 to a mub measurement and to the optimal projective - measurement - based tomography scheme , i.e. , the haar - uniform random  .",
    "we do nt discuss the process of binning the position - measurement results that das and arvind engage in , since such a process produces a rank-2 povm that is equivalent to sampling from a discrete distribution over projective measurements and then adding noise , a practice that necessarily degrades tomographic performance .",
    "we conclude that the protocol does not offer anything beyond that offered by random odops and that its claim of extracting information about the system without disturbance is not supported by our analysis . in particular , when operated optimally , it is essentially the same as the strong projective measurements of a haar - uniform random .",
    "it is true that the presence of the @xmath38 and @xmath99 measurements provides more information than a projective @xmath37 measurement by itself , but this is not because the @xmath38 and @xmath99 measurements extract information without disturbing the system .",
    "our analysis of weak - measurement tomographic schemes gives us guidance for future forays into tomography .",
    "povms contain the necessary and sufficient information for comparing the performance of tomographic techniques .",
    "specific realizations of a povm might provide pleasing narratives , but these narratives are irrelevant for calculating figures of merit .",
    "optimal povms for many figures of merit and technical limitations are known .",
    "a new tomographic proposal should identify restrictions on the set of available povms that come about from practical considerations and compare itself to the best known povm in that set .",
    "the question of the optimality of das and arvind s tomographic scheme is easily answered by identifying what povms arise from `` projective measurement - based tomography '' and realizing these povms are optimal even in the generalized nonadaptive , individual - measurement scenario .",
    "claims about novel properties of a state - reconstruction technique should be evaluated as a comparison with a motivated restriction on the set of povms . the false dichotomy between `` tomographic methods '' and whatever new method is being proposed obfuscates that all new methods implement a povm and that reconstructing a state from povm statistics is nothing but tomography .",
    "our analysis shows that even the relatively bland and conceptually simple set of random odops captures most of the behavior exhibited by more exotic protocols .",
    "it is appropriate to move beyond the minimal , platform - independent povm description when considering ease of implementation or when trying to provide a helpful conceptual framework .",
    "nonetheless , a pleasing conceptual framework should not be confused with an optimal experimental arrangement .",
    "if the experimental setup described by lundeen _ et al . _  happens to be the easiest to implement in one s lab , the state should still be reconstructed using techniques developed in the general povm setting rather than the perturbative reconstruction formula presented in work on dst , regardless of how attractive one finds the wavefunction - amplitude analogy .",
