    "the dwarf galaxy vv124 is one of the `` newest '' members of the local universe .",
    "the discovery of vv124 was first published in the @xcite atlas and catalog of interacting galaxies , though the galaxy does not have an interacting neighbor .",
    "the cfa galaxy redshift survey @xcite reported its redshift as @xmath7  km  s@xmath1 . in the hubble flow",
    ", this redshift corresponds to a distance of @xmath8  mpc . at that distance ,",
    "vv124 would have belonged to a group of three galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite noticed resolved stars in sloan digital sky survey images @xcite .",
    "@xcite  imaged vv124 to a depth of @xmath9 , and they confirmed that it is in fact much nearer than 10  mpc .",
    "they measured a distance of @xmath10  mpc based on the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "this new distance placed the galaxy on the periphery of the local group . despite its proximity to the group , vv124 is extremely isolated .",
    "its nearest neighbor , leo  a , is another isolated dwarf galaxy 700  kpc away @xcite .",
    "the revision to vv124 s distance drastically affected its inferred star formation history . from low - resolution spectroscopy , @xcite measured its h@xmath11 star formation rate as @xmath12 , but that rate was based on a distance of 10.5  mpc . corrected to the true distance of 1.36  mpc @xcite , the rate dropped to @xmath13 ( a point also noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b11a ) .",
    "the new distance also inspired deep photometry in addition to that obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite  obtained wide - field @xmath14 photometry of vv124 at the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) to study the structure of the galaxy in detail . @xcite",
    "obtained even deeper @xmath15 and @xmath16 photometry over a smaller field with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys .",
    "they determined that @xmath17 of the stars are older than 10  gyr .",
    "the rest are younger than 1  gyr .",
    "@xcite used the same hst images as @xcite  to show that the oldest , most metal - poor population is significantly more extended than the younger stars .",
    "the galaxy - averaged star formation rates that @xcite  derived were @xmath18 over the last 0.5  gyr and @xmath19 over the last 1  gyr .",
    "together , the hst photometry and h@xmath11 spectroscopy indicated that vv124 is a typically old dwarf galaxy that experienced a small burst of star formation @xmath20  gyr ago .",
    "@xcite expanded @xcite s ( @xcite ) study .",
    "they classified vv124 as transition - type galaxy , caught between being an dirr and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) .",
    "they noticed that the young , blue stars lie in a thin , disk - like structure , whereas the older , red giants occupy a thicker configuration .",
    "however , the small number of very young stars was inconsistent with an irregular - only classification . therefore , they concluded that vv124 is a rare dirr / dsph galaxy .",
    "@xcite listed only five other such members of the local group : antlia , aquarius , phoenix , pisces , and kkr  25 .",
    "this class of galaxies is especially interesting because their existence supports the theory that dsphs are dirrs that lost their gas through ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions with other galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is strong observational support for the removal of gas from dwarf galaxies in dense environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the similarity of the star formation histories except in the past gyr of dirrs , dsphs , and dirr / dsphs further supports the transformation of dirrs into dsphs @xcite .",
    "although there are counterexamples , such as the comparatively young leo  a dirr @xcite , the star formation history of vv124 less recent than 1  gyr appears much like other dirrs and dsphs . except for the recent burst , @xcite reported that almost all of its stars are ancient , like nearly all dsphs .",
    "the dynamics of vv124 have been unclear . despite the corrected redshift",
    ", measurements of the galaxy s radial velocity have been inconsistent . @xcite and @xcite obtained low - resolution spectroscopy of individual stars , resolved regions , diffuse stellar light , and diffuse emission .",
    "the velocities varied widely , but they seemed to cluster around @xmath21  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite  measured the velocity structure with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "they measured a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath22  km  s@xmath1 with a dispersion of @xmath23  km  s@xmath1 and a full range of about @xmath24 to 0  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite  also measured the velocities of a blue supergiant and a young star cluster , but the cluster velocity was inconsistent with ( more negative than ) the velocity by @xmath25 .",
    "so far , the discrepancy between the velocities of the neutral gas and younger populations has not been resolved .",
    "@xcite  also observed what appears to be a stellar disk .",
    "vv124 is elongated ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , but its shape can not be described by a single ellipsoid .",
    "there is an even more elongated component whose major axis is aligned with the main spheroid . the second component , which @xcite  called `` wings , '' resembles a stellar disk , which should rotate coherently , unlike the spheroid . as an alternative , @xcite  also proposed that the wings might be tidal tails instead of a disk .",
    "however , vv124 s extreme isolation makes strong tidal interaction unlikely .    in order to provide closure to the discrepancies in velocity measurements and to test for rotation",

    "targets were selected from @xcite s photometric catalog .",
    "deimos slitlets can not overlap in the dispersion direction , and the vv124 field is dense enough that we needed to prioritize the targets for placement on the deimos slitmasks .",

    "we used the 1200  lines  mm@xmath1 grating centered at 7800   .",
    "this grating , combined with the slit widths of 0.7  , yielded a line spread profile with a fwhm of 1.2   .",
    "the resolving power is about @xmath45 near the triplet ( cat ) at 8500   .",

    "individual exposure times for the vv124 slitmasks ranged from 20 to 30  minutes .",
    "most of the exposures were 30  minutes .",
    "we checked the alignment of the slitmask about once per hour by placing the grating in zeroth order . in this direct imaging mode , bright alignment stars aligned with 4  boxes in the slitmask .",
    "we measured the seeing by fitting gaussian profiles to the point spread functions of the alignment stars .",
    "seeing remained low and stable for the entire night ( see table  [ tab : obslog ] ) .",
    "we reduced the raw images into one - dimensional spectra with the ` spec2d ` software developed by the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe  2 team ( deep2 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the software excised the footprint of each spectrally dispersed slitlet from each exposure of the flat field , arc lamps , and science targets . because the deimos focal plane is curved ,",
    "the program rectified the slitlet images by tracing and straightening both the edges of the flat field and the roughly orthogonal arc lines .",
    "then , the program generated a flat field image from the three exposures of the quartz lamp .",
    "this flat field was used to remove the slit response function , dust , and cosmetic imperfections in the science images .",
    "the ` spec2d ` software also fitted a fifth - order legendre polynomial in wavelength to the pixel positions of arc lines . for each exposure of each slitlet , ` spec2d ` computed the sky emission as a function of wavelength and subtracted it from the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "all of the science exposures for each slitmask were averaged with inverse variance weighting and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "finally , the object spectrum was extracted with optimal weighting @xcite .",
    "the final result was a clean , one - dimensional spectrum , wavelength - calibrated to a precision of 0.01   .",
    "the spectrum was not flux calibrated , and it did not need to be for our purposes .",
    "some spectra suffered from artifacts or such low snr that measurement of the radial velocity was not possible .",
    "there were 13  such spectra .",
    "they are included and identified in table  [ tab : catalog ] , but we do not consider them further .",
    "the ` spec2d ` software also computed the error spectrum from poisson statistics of the raw frame .",
    "the errors were adjusted appropriately during flat fielding , and the one - dimensional error spectrum was extracted identically to the flux spectrum .",
    "we used the error spectra for estimation of uncertainties in radial velocities ( section  [ sec : rv ] ) and metallicities ( section  [ sec : metallicity ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : selection ] , the two slitmasks included 106 duplicate targets .",
    "we measured the precision of our velocity measurements using the independently measured radial velocities from the two slitmasks .",
    "however , for the final list of radial velocities , we used a combined spectrum .",
    "we summed the two one - dimensional spectra for each duplicate object with inverse variance weighting .",
    "we removed telluric absorption using archived deimos spectra of hot stars .",
    "we used the same hot star spectra and spectral division procedure as @xcite .",
    "however , our science exposures took place over an entire night .",
    "the varying airmass and water vapor made it impossible to remove the telluric absorption accurately .",
    "regions of moderately strong telluric absorption were not considered for metallicity measurements .",
    "the metallicity measurements discussed in section  [ sec : metallicity ] required normalization of the spectral continuum .",
    "we followed the continuum normalization procedure described by ( * ? ? ? * their section  3.4 ) .",
    "after normalization , we calculated the snr of each spectrum .",
    "first , we computed the median absolute deviation ( m.a.d . )  from the continuum of pixels in `` continuum regions '' ( defined by * ? ? ? * ) in the rest wavelength ranges 74007500   , 77508100   , and 84008900   . these selections excluded most telluric absorption and tio bands .",

    "this measurement of snr is sensitive to inaccuracies in the continuum placement , which will artificially decrease the snr .",
    "however , errors in continuum placement dominate the snr calculation only at @xmath48 , which is much higher than any member star in our sample .",
    "the radial velocity template spectrum , provided by @xcite , is shown in red in all three panels .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the spectra with the highest and lowest snrs in our sample .",
    "the middle panel shows the faintest member star in our sample.[fig : example ] ]    we measured radial velocities and their uncertainties following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "first , we measured the radial velocity of the star by cross - correlating the observed spectrum with a library of template stars and galaxies observed with deimos .",
    "the template spectra were the same as those used by @xcite .",
    "they were observed with a nearly identical configuration of deimos and therefore have the same resolution as our science spectra . the strong atmospheric a and b  bands ( 75887700    and 68626950",
    " ) were excluded from the cross - correlation .",
    "three weaker telluric bands ( 71677315   , 82108325   , and 89009200   ) were given weights of 10% of other pixels in the cross - correlation .",
    "we adopted the velocity corresponding to the cross - correlation peak of the template with the lowest @xmath49 when compared to the observed spectrum .",
    "we call this velocity @xmath50 . figure  [ fig : example ] shows typical spectra of vv124 member stars along with the best - fitting template spectra .",
    "next , we computed a correction for mis - centering of the star in the slitlet @xcite . for this step",
    ", we used the observed spectrum before correction for telluric absorption .",
    "we cross - correlated this spectrum with the spectrum of hr  1641 , a hot , rapidly rotating star .",
    "only regions subject to significant telluric absorption ( the same regions used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were considered in the cross - correlation .",
    "we call the velocity obtained from this cross - correlation @xmath51 . the radial velocity of the star is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the heliocentric velocity correction appropriate for keck observatory on the observation date .",
    "we estimated uncertainties in @xmath54 by monte carlo resampling of the spectra .",
    "for each of 1000 realizations , we added gaussian random noise to the spectrum . the dispersion of the gaussian probability distribution at each pixel was equal to the estimated poisson error of that pixel .",
    "then , we recomputed @xmath50 and @xmath51 for each realization . for computational efficiency",
    ", we considered only the template spectrum that best matched the original spectrum .",
    "the standard deviation of the 1000 measurements of @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    ", was adjusted to ensure that the standard deviation is unity.[fig : vdiff ] ]     as a function of snr for all member stars .",
    "the total error is the quadrature sum of the random ( monte carlo ) and systematic error terms.[fig : vdiffsn ] ]    from duplicate @xmath54 measurements of the same stars , @xcite  realized that @xmath56 was an incomplete estimate of the radial velocity uncertainty . in order to explain the dispersion among the repeat measurements",
    ", they added a systematic error term , @xmath57 , in quadrature with @xmath56 .",
    "the systematic term was chosen such that the radial velocity differences divided by their total uncertainties were distributed normally with unit standard deviation .",
    "@xmath58    because we observed 106 duplicate objects on both deimos slitmasks , we also calculated a systematic error term .",
    "we excluded galaxies , obvious foreground dwarfs with  8190 absorption , and other objects failing any membership criterion other than radial velocity ( see section  [ sec : membership ] ) . from the 57  remaining stars",

    "the width of the distribution matches a unit gaussian because @xmath57 was tuned to force such a match .",
    "figure  [ fig : vdiffsn ] shows how velocity errors and uncertainties trend with snr .",
    "the @xmath54 differences between repeat measurements ( top panel ) are based on exposures from one slitmask only",

    "@xcite  identified the extinction - corrected magnitude of the trgb as @xmath61 . in selecting spectroscopic targets , we prioritized stars with @xmath35 , which conservatively allowed for large error in the trgb magnitude .",

    "stars brighter than the trgb are not likely members .",
    "we carefully examined all stars with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 brighter than the trgb ) . after excluding stars failing to meet the membership criteria in the following sections , four stars remained .",
    "star 8116 showed broad cat lines .",
    "the width and shape suggested pressure broadening typical of dwarf stars .",
    "therefore , we ruled 8116 as a non - member .",
    "the spectrum of star 8445 looked in all respects like a red giant .",
    "although the star is slightly brighter and bluer than the trgb , we kept 8445 in the member list under the premise that it is an agb star .",
    "the spectrum of star 11163 showed very strong cyanogen bands .",
    "if this carbon star is an agb member of vv124 , it could be significantly brighter and redder than the trgb .",
    "in fact , that is its location in the cmd .",
    "for this reason , we kept 11163 in the membership list .",
    "finally , star 13649 is solidly in the `` wall '' of foreground dwarfs in the cmd , and its  8190 equivalent width ( ew ) is very close to the cut - off for membership ( see the next section ) .",
    "we ruled 13649 a foreground dwarf for the combination of its position in the cmd and moderately strong  8190 doublet .",
    "inspection of the deimos spectra revealed that many of our targets were background galaxies or foreground dwarf stars .",
    "first , we excluded all objects with emission lines or broad , redshifted ca  h and ca  k in absorption .",
    "these 20 objects are background galaxies .",
    "second , we excluded stars with very strong , broad  8190 doublets .",
    "the strengths of these lines are especially sensitive to surface gravity . that sensitivity makes them excellent discriminators between giants and foreground dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "we measured the ews of each of the two lines in the doublet by fitting two independent gaussians .",
    "we computed monte carlo uncertainties by resampling the spectrum 100 times . for each pixel in each resample , we added noise from a gaussian random distribution with a standard deviation equal to the estimated poisson noise of that pixel .",

    "it is possible that vv124 could have formed as a dispersion - supported galaxy , but this scenario runs contrary to the view that dwarf galaxies formed as disks from which supernova feedback removed gas with low angular momentum @xcite .",
    "another challenge is to explain the low gas fraction of vv124 relative to other isolated dwarf galaxies . in a sample of 39 dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from @xcite and gas masses from @xcite ,",
    "the only galaxies with lower gas fractions than vv124 ( @xmath184 ) are satellites of the milky way or m31 , not isolated dwarfs like vv124 .    the tidal stirring model @xcite explains the transformation from dirrs to dsphs in the context of galaxy environment .",
    "this model posits that disky dirrs lose their gas through ram pressure stripping in a group environment .",
    "the stars then lose their rotational structure by tidal interactions .",
    "numerous simulations address the transformation of dirrs to dsphs by tidal stirring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the stated goal of most of these simulations is to construct a spheroid from a disk . as a result",
    ", few studies address the kind of morphology peculiar to vv124 ( a spheroid with a very faint disk - like feature ) .",
    "nonetheless , the intermediate stages of some tidal stirring simulations resemble a spheroid with a disk .",
    "the simulated tidally stirred dwarf galaxy in figure  12 of @xcite is a decent representation of vv124 , but the `` disk '' is actually tidal tails .",
    "our radial velocity observations of stars in the wings of vv124 do not support their interpretation as a disk .",
    "hence , they may be tidal tails .",
    "however , tidal tails near apocenter are expected to be elongated toward the perturber @xcite .",
    "the disk- or tail - like feature observed in vv124 must be nearly perpendicular to the milky way , and the great circle that connects vv124 and m31 intersects the major axis of vv124 at an angle of @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the elongated photometric features are unlikely to be tidal tails resulting from an interaction with either of the large spiral galaxies of the local group .",
    "furthermore , vv124 is in a remote corner of the local group , highly isolated from other galaxies .",
    "@xcite concluded that vv124 resides outside the zero - velocity surface of the local group .",
    "because its velocity relative to the local group s barycenter is positive , it will never enter the group in the future . additionally , @xcite  calculated that the intragroup medium around vv124 is probably not dense enough to remove gas by ram pressure stripping . as a result ,",
    "tidal stirring would require that vv124 passed near another galaxy and subsequently traveled @xmath20  mpc to its current position .",
    "traveling such a large distance after a tidal interaction is not out of the question . a dwarf galaxy that passed within half of the virial radius of a massive halo",
    "could have traveled up to several virial radii beyond that massive halo @xcite .",
    "as many as 10% of all dark matter halos are actually ejected subhalos that can be found as far away as four virial radii from their former hosts @xcite .",
    "vv124 qualifies as a candidate subhalo ejected from either the milky way or m31 .",
    "its low velocity relative to the local group would require vv124 to be near its apocenter .",
    "such a location would not be surprising given its large distance from the nearest massive halo .",
    "it also makes sense that we would observe an ejected subhalo near its apocenter because subhalos linger near their apocenters . as a potentially ejected satellite galaxy",
    ", vv124 could be an example of tidal stirring . in this scenario ,",
    "a brief , high - speed passage near the milky way or m31 removed most of its gas , and the violent change in tidal force near pericenter disrupted its stellar disk .",
    "a single passage is sufficient for ram pressure stripping to remove most or all of the gas in a galaxy of vv124 s circular velocity @xcite , but most simulations of tidal stirring require multiple pericentric passages to transform a disk into a spheroid @xcite .",
    "the tidal stirring explanation requires special circumstances .",
    "first , vv124 had to have been ejected from the milky way or m31 , possibly in a multi - body encounter .",
    "second , the stellar disk would have to be disrupted in just one pericentric passage , or vv124 would have had to acquire a large amount of orbital energy in a multi - body encounter on a subsequent pericentric passage .",
    "third , the tidal tails  if indeed the photometric wings are tidal tails  would have to somehow point in a direction away from the former host galaxy .",
    "while our observations support the interpretation of vv124 as a galaxy of a type between dirr and dsph , they do not explain how it came to be that way .",
    "we look forward to future simulations that will manufacture a digital replica of vv124 : an isolated , mostly spheroidal dwarf galaxy that somehow lost most of its gas but retained wispy , minimally rotating wings .",
