    "t  tauri stars ( ttss ) are young and low - mass ( @xmath9  m@xmath10 ) pre - main sequence stars with strong and complex magnetic fields and a surrounding disc that is truncated near the corotation radius by interaction with the magnetic field . from the observational point of view ttss",
    "are split into two main groups : classical ttss ( cttss ) and weak lined ttss ( wttss ) .",
    "cttss are accreting mass from the disc whereas wttss have no or very little spectral signatures of accretion .",
    "the material in the inner part of the disc is ionized by the stellar radiation and channelled through the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the gas from the disc is accelerated to almost free - fall velocity before it reaches the stellar surface forming an accretion shock ( see , e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed simulations of the interaction between the stellar field and the inner disc show a complex dynamics of the magnetospheric flow that depends on the field properties and its stability @xcite .",
    "some analytical expressions for the hotspot shapes and the magnetospheric radius have been provided by @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the star , disc and magnetic field produces an excess emission at different wavelengths that affects the evolution of the disc itself and the circumstellar environment .",
    "the atmospheric and magnetospheric energy output is released mainly in the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectral range .",
    "thus , there is a relatively large number of spectral features in the uv that can be used as potential tracers of the physical conditions in tts .",
    "different emission lines in the uv wavelength range provide different information about the regions in which they are formed , the involved physical processes and the system geometry . for example , the mg  ii resonance doublet at 2795.5 and 2802.7    is produced in the chromosphere of tts and it is one of the strongest features in uv spectra of tts . mg  ii is sensitive to , and can be used as a good tracer of , atmosphere and outflow / wind in tts ( * ? ? ?",

    "n  v , c  iv , he  ii and si  iv are good tracers of hot gas and accretion processes in ttss .",
    "the relationship between these lines and mass accretion in ttss has been already studied by different authors @xcite .",
    "the semiforbidden lines of the c  ii ] quintuplet ( wavelengths : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15   ) are not observed in wttss ; however , they are readily detected in cttss , even in low mass accretors @xcite .",
    "this multiplet seems to be a very sensitive tracer of accretion or outflows @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite analysed these lines in low resolution spectra and found a relationship between the c  ii ] luminosity and the accretion luminosity .",
    "the study of the c  ii ] flux ratios within a small range of wavelengths provides a good opportunity to investigate tts properties because they are optically thin and their ratios do not depend on the geometry of the accretion system and are only slightly affected by the large uncertainties associated with extinction determination .",
    "it is known that the relative intensities of the emission lines of the c  ii ] multiplet are sensitive to the electron density in the range @xmath16  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "plasma in the magnetospheres and atmospheres of cttss is within this density range .",

    "we found the best - fitting spectrum to the data using a grid of simulated profiles computed for a broad range of electron densities and temperatures .",
    "the log of observations , the characteristics of the cttss sample and the profiles are described in section  [ sample ] . the numerical method used to derive the individual lines fluxes and the properties of the radiating plasma",
    "is presented in section  [ plasma ] , that also includes the limitations of the method and the final results . in section  4 , we present the plasma properties obtained with our procedure and they are compared with the accretion rates derived from @xcite . to conclude , in section  5",
