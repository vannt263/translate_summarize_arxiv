    "the field of bec - bcs crossover has attracted great attention from both experimental and theoretical sides . in experiments ,",
    "the system is studied near feshbach resonances so that the scattering length can be tuned by an applied magnetic field . at low temperatures , when the scattering length is tuned from negative side to positive side , the system evolves from a bcs state to a molecular bec state .",
    "the observation of molecular bec was first reported in references @xcite . when the scattering length was fast tuned from the negative side to the positive side of the resonance , condensation of fermion pairs",
    "was observed @xcite . since then",
    "quite a few experiments have focused on various properties of the system , including collective excitations @xcite , single - particle excitations @xcite , and thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "the observation of vortex lattice @xcite has provided a conclusive evidence of superfluidity across the resonance in this system .    the vortex structure in superfluid fermi gas",
    "have been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "however most of these works focus on the non - rotating case , which is different from the experimental situation . to consider the effect of rotation",
    ", we have developed a phenomenological approach , based on our previous work on the phase - slip phenomenon in the resonant fermi superfluid @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the properties of a vortex in the unitary limit @xcite , because it is a special strong - interaction region where the magnitude of the scattering length is much bigger than the interparticle distance . in the unitary limit , the interparticle distance replaces the scattering length as the most important length scale , and the physical properties become unitary . in the following ,",
    "we first present our phenomenological approach and then study the vortex structure at various temperatures and rotation frequencies .",
    "in our previous work @xcite , we developed a phenomenological theory for the resonant fermi superfluid based on ginzburg - landau theory . to consider the effect of rotation ,",
    "we study the system in the rotating frame , in which the single - particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the transverse and longitudinal trapping frequencies , and @xmath5 is the rotation frequency . here",
    "the trapping potential is assumed to have the rotation symmetry in the transverse plane .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the canonical momentum , and @xmath8 . from eq .",
    "( [ eqrt ] ) , we conclude that the motion of a charge - neutral fermion in a rotating frame is analogous to an electron moving in a vector potential @xmath9 and in a trapping potential reduced in the transverse direction .    in the superfluid state ,",
    "the free energy of a fermi gas is lower than that in the normal state , and the energy difference is defined as the condensation energy .",
    "the total free energy @xmath10 is the sum of condensation energy @xmath11 and the free energy of the normal state @xmath12 , @xmath13 the free energy of the normal state @xmath14 is generally a complicated function of temperature , particle density , trapping potential , the scattering length , and the rotation frequency .",
    "according to ginzburg - landau theory , the condensation energy can be expressed as a functional of the vector potential @xmath9 and the order parameter @xmath15 which is proportional to the energy gap of the fermion excitation , @xmath16 are coefficients .",
    "although ginzburg - landau theory was originally proposed for describing superconducting system near the transition , it can often be applied to most of the region below the transition temperature .",
    "when the system is not rotating , @xmath17 , the sign change of the coefficient @xmath18 signals the superfluid transition . below the transition temperature @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the system has lower free energy in the superfluid state than in the normal state . when the system is rotating , the transition temperature becomes a function of the rotation frequency @xmath5 . in the following , the symbol @xmath19 is defined as the transition temperature at @xmath17 .    in the superfluid state ,",
    "the total free energy @xmath10 is at a minimum point as a functional of the particle density @xmath21 and the superfluid order parameter @xmath22 , @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) , the derivative is taken under the constraint of constant total - particle number . in principle , if the free energy @xmath10 is known , the distributions of particle density and order parameter in the superfluid state can be solved from the saddle point equations , eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] , [ s2 ] ) .    at low temperatures and low rotation frequencies ,",
    "when the fermi energy is much bigger than rotation energy , @xmath24 , the average kinetic energy per particle is proportional to @xmath25 in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . in the unitary limit",
    ", the interparticle distance replaces the scattering length , and the average interaction energy is also proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the free energy of the normal state is approximately given by @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27/2 $ ] is the trapping potential reduced due to rotation , and @xmath28 is a dimensionless constant . from the experiment @xcite , the constant @xmath28",
    "is estimated to be about 4.3 . at low rotation frequencies , @xmath24 ,",
    "the constant @xmath28 does not depend on the rotation frequency @xmath5 .",
    "in general , the normal - state free energy @xmath14 should be temperature dependent .",
    "however , near the transition temperature which is much smaller than the fermi temperature @xcite , the normal - state free energy @xmath14 is weakly dependent on the temperature and the coefficient @xmath28 is approximately temperature independent .    in the unitary limit , the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath29 in eq .",

    "when there is no superfluid current , the phase of the order parameter is uniform and the angular momentum totally comes from the normal fluid , @xmath51 as the density of the normal fluid and @xmath52 as the superfluid density . in rotating systems ,",

    "the densities at other places increase . as a result",
    ", the density at the center slightly increases with the increase of temperature .    the total free energy as a function of the rotation frequency is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ lp ] ) .    as the rotation frequency increases , the free energy decreases mainly due to the reduction of the trapping potential .",
    "as the temperature increases , the free energy also increases .",
    "in contrast , the absolute value of the condensation energy decreases with the increase of temperature as shown in fig .",

    "( [ mp ] ) .",
    "the linear dependence comes from the normal fluid contribution , and in contrast the superfluid in the vortex state contributes a small constant to the total angular momentum .",
    "so far we use the weak - interaction expressions of the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 to obtain vortex properties .",
    "it is likely that the accurate expressions of these parameters in the unitary limit are different .",
    "here we examine how sensitive the vortex properties are to these parameters . in fig .",
    "( [ n10p ] ) , the density profiles of the vortex at @xmath67 with various values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are plotted .    as shown in fig .",
    "( [ n10p ] ) , when @xmath65 increases or @xmath66 decreases , the dip at the center of the vortex becomes bigger .",
    "this is due to the increase of order parameter and the increase of the absolute value of the condensation energy as shown in fig .",
    "( [ ecp ] ) .      in summary",
    ", we have developed a phenomenological theory to study the vortex properties of a superfluid fermi gas in the unitary region .",
    "this charge - neutral system under rotation is mapped onto an electron system in a vector potential . in the framework of the ginzburg - landau theory , the order - parameter and density distributions in the equilibrium state",
    "are solved numerically from the saddle - point equations of the free energy .",
    "we identify that the superfluid density is four times the magnitude of the order parameter squared , which can be determined from the angular - momentum density .",
    "the size of the vortex core is found to increase with the rotation frequency due to the density decrease near the core .",
    "thermodynamical properties of the vortex , such as the free energy and angular momentum , are also obtained .",
    "our theoretical results can be directly tested in experiments .",
    "although the vortex properties in the unitary region are studied extensively in this paper , more work are needed to study the rotation effect in other regions of the bec - bcs crossover , such as the crossover region and the bec side .",
    "it is also interesting to extend this phenomenological approach to study the properties of vortex lattices in the bec - bcs crossover .",
