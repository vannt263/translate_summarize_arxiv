    "thus , potential models  including relativistic corrections  have been successfully used to understand the spectroscopy of the corresponding mesonic bound states @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the small size of the hadronic system makes possible to attempt a short - distance approach . at the relevant energy scale , @xmath0 is small enough to allow ( at least for the lowest levels ) a well - grounded quantum field theory analysis with perturbative qcd tools , including non - perturbative corrections through the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "while the coulombic part of the @xmath8 potential is obviously related to the static piece of the gluon - exchange interaction , a systematic short - distance investigation provides a better understanding of the remaining terms in the heavy quark potential , in terms of fundamental qcd parameters @xcite .",
    "the short - distance description in terms of quarks and gluons is specially well suited for inclusive quantities , where no reference to a particular hadronic bound state is needed .",
    "the vacuum polarization @xmath9 induced by the heavy - quark vector current @xmath10 is then a key ingredient to investigate the @xmath11 @xmath8 states .",
    "its imaginary part can be experimentally determined from the @xmath12 cross - section : @xmath13 on the other side , @xmath9 can be calculated theoretically within the ope . to keep our equations more general ,",
    "let us consider the vector current @xmath14 , @xmath15 being a heavy quark field of mass @xmath16 , specifically the bottom quark in our case : @xmath17 throughout this work , @xmath16 corresponds to the pole of the perturbatively renormalized propagator , whereas the running quark mass in the @xmath4 scheme @xcite renormalized at a scale @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath19 .    using a dispersion relation the @xmath20th derivative of @xmath21 at @xmath22",
    "can be expressed in terms of the @xmath20th integral moment of @xmath23 : @xmath24 for later convenience , the moments @xmath25 are defined to be dimensionless quantities .",
    "in addition , it will prove useful to express the moments @xmath25 in terms of integrals over the variable @xmath26 , @xmath27 under the assumption of quark - hadron duality , the moments @xmath25 can either be calculated theoretically in renormalization group improved perturbation theory , including non - perturbative condensate contributions , or can be obtained from experiment . in this way , hadronic quantities like masses and decay widths get related to the qcd parameters @xmath0 , @xmath3 and condensates .    for large values of @xmath20 ,",
    "the moments become dominated by the threshold region .",
    "therefore , they are very sensitive to the heavy quark mass . this fact has been exploited since the very first qcd analyses of charmonium and bottomium @xcite to extract rather accurate values of @xmath28 and @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested by voloshin @xcite that the large-@xmath20 moments can also be used to get a precise determination of @xmath0 from the existing data on @xmath1 resonances .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the moments contains powers of @xmath29 @xcite , which correspond to the coulombic contributions ; they are associated with the near - threshold quark - antiquark configurations at typical velocity @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 is the familiar coulomb parameter . at large @xmath20 these coulombic @xmath32 terms",
    "should be explicitly summed up to assure a reasonable convergence of the perturbative series . by the same token , this large - n behaviour implies a big sensitivity to the value of @xmath0 @xcite .    in ref .",

    "the quoted errors are claimed to include the experimental uncertainties and the theoretical uncertainty due to subleading @xmath33 terms @xcite .    the reasoning of ref .",
    "@xcite looks indeed very suggestive .",
    "the large-@xmath20 moments are dominated by the first @xmath1 resonance .",
    "thus , one is actually starting with a confined bound state . in spite of that",
    ", our ability to make an explicit sum of the coulombic contributions allows to make an impressive determination of the perturbative coupling .",
    "obviously , an accurate analysis of the theoretical uncertainties is called for .    the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed at @xmath38 , i.e. , only the @xmath39 and @xmath38 perturbative contributions to the correlator @xmath9 were included .",
    "therefore , the scale and scheme dependence of @xmath0 was not under control . adopting the @xmath40 scheme ,",
    "the running of @xmath0 was included in the coulomb potential , and used to fix the scale of the coulombic contributions . for the remaining short - distance perturbative corrections the blm prescription @xcite was used to justify the choice @xmath41 . given that , the quoted uncertainty in the final @xmath0 determination looks rather unrealistic .    in order to make a more reliable analysis one needs to know the size of the higher - order perturbative corrections .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath42 contributions to the correlator @xmath9 have been studied recently @xcite .",
    "although a complete analytical calculation of these corrections is still not available , the present information is good enough to perform an accurate analysis of the moments @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed study of the relevant moments , using all the information on @xmath9 that we are aware of . from the present experimental data we determine the numerical values of the bottom quark mass and the strong coupling .",
    "moreover , we perform a thorough analysis of the associated uncertainties .    the resulting values of @xmath43 and @xmath2 are found to be less precise than what was claimed in ref .",
    "nevertheless , they still constitute rather accurate determinations .",
    "the value of the strong coupling constant turns out to be in excellent agreement with the more precise measurements obtained from the @xmath44 hadronic width @xcite or from @xmath45 data @xcite .",
    "previous claims @xcite that low - energy determinations of @xmath0 result in lower @xmath43 values than higher - energy ones are thus unfounded . on the other side ,",
    "our analysis of the @xmath1 system provides the most precise determination of the bottom quark mass today .",
    "the known perturbative contributions to the moments are given in section  2 and the coulomb resummation is performed in section  3 .",
    "the non - perturbative corrections are discussed in section  4 .",
    "section  5 contains the phenomenological parameterization , extracted from the present data .",

    "@xcite , it is convenient to split @xmath64 according to the colour factors , @xmath70 and to treat the four different contributions separately , because they exhibit different behaviour at threshold . @xmath71 and @xmath72 contain the pure gluonic contributions ; the first term is already present in an abelian theory , whereas @xmath72 is characteristic of the non - abelian aspects of qcd .",
    "the contributions @xmath73 and @xmath74 arise from diagrams with internal light and heavy quark loops respectively .",
    "the spectral function @xmath75 is known analytically and @xmath76 receives contributions from a two - particle cut with threshold at @xmath77 which is known analytically and a four - particle cut with threshold at @xmath78 which can be calculated numerically from a two - dimensional integral @xcite .",

    ".[tab:1 ] one- , two- and three - loop perturbative contributions for the first twenty moments @xmath25 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the separate contributions to the theoretical error have been obtained by performing the same variations as for the pole - mass scheme and have been listed in table  [ tab:5 ] .",
    "the uncertainty from higher - order corrections is now due to the variation of the scales @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the scale @xmath82 should not be taken lower than roughly @xmath83 because otherwise the @xmath84 correction @xmath85 becomes unacceptably large .",
    "since in addition to @xmath82 for the @xmath4 scheme we can also vary @xmath86 , the resulting uncertainty , especially for @xmath3 , is larger than for the pole mass . adding all errors in quadrature , we arrive at our final result in the @xmath4 scheme : @xmath87 evolving the strong coupling constant to @xmath88 , we find @xmath89    it is gratifying to observe that the resulting values for @xmath43 from the pole - mass and @xmath4 schemes turn out to be in very good agreement .",
    "this is a further indication that the uncertainty from unknown higher - order corrections is under control .",
    "in addition , our results @xmath90 and @xmath2 for the @xmath91-quark mass satisfy the relation ( [ eq : a.4 ] ) between the pole and @xmath4 mass within the errors .",
    "this should be expected because the relation ( [ eq : a.4 ] ) has been used to rewrite the moment sum rules in terms of the @xmath4 mass .",
    "nevertheless , it again shows that variations due to higher orders are accounted for by our error estimates .",
    "before we enter a discussion of our findings , let us again summarize the central results . for the bottom quark mass in the pole - mass as well as @xmath4 scheme ,",
    "we obtain @xmath92 respectively . combining both determinations of the strong coupling constant @xmath0",
    ", we find @xmath93 we have not averaged the errors of the two determinations because they are not independent .",
    "the bottom quark mass values obtained by us are in good agreement to previous determinations from qcd sum rules @xcite and a very recent calculation from lattice qcd @xcite . owing to the big sensitivity of the moment sum rules for the @xmath1 system to the quark mass , and the good control over higher - order @xmath0 corrections ,",
    "our result is more precise .    nevertheless , the pole quark - mass value obtained by us is in disagreement to the result found by voloshin @xcite . in our opinion",
    "the discrepancy is due to the importance of higher @xmath34 corrections , which in ref .",
    "@xcite were either neglected , or numerically fitted from the sum rules . in @xcite it was assumed that the leading order correction goes like @xmath33 .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4.8 ] ) and ( [ eq:4.11 ] ) , it is clear that they rather behave like @xmath94 . besides , we have also demonstrated that for the region of @xmath20 used in the analysis , the large-@xmath20 expansion is not justified .",
    "in addition , the second - order @xmath0 correction was only partially and partly incorrectly taken into account .",
    "therefore , the scale dependence of @xmath0 was not under control .",
    "let us shortly comment on the renormalon ambiguity of the pole mass . during the last years , it has been realized that beyond perturbation theory the pole masses for the charm and bottom quarks suffer from unknown renormalon ambiguities , leading to additional theoretical uncertainties in their determination @xcite . on general grounds",
    "this uncertainty has been estimated to be of @xmath95 . throughout our analysis",
    ", the pole mass has been defined as the pole of the perturbatively renormalized quark propagator .",
    "our determination ( [ eq:8.1 ] ) might therefore be subject to additional uncertainties which go beyond perturbation theory but which we can not assess in a precise way .    within our errors the result obtained for @xmath43 , eq .  ( [ eq:8.3 ] ) ,",
    "is compatible with the result by voloshin  @xcite , though , given the shortcomings of this analysis discussed above , his errors appear to be largely underestimated .",
    "thus , previous claims of a low value of @xmath43 from low - energy determinations which could hint to new physics @xcite are unfounded . on the other hand ,",
    "our central value for @xmath43 is surprisingly close to the current world average @xmath96 @xcite , although the error is certainly larger .",
    "the dominant uncertainty for the determination of the @xmath91-quark mass and @xmath0 from the @xmath1 system was found to originate from the dependence on the renormalization scale , or , equivalently , the size of the as yet unknown higher - order corrections .",
    "improving the error on the @xmath0 determination will thus only be possible if the full @xmath97 correction to the moments @xmath25 is known and if it turns out to be reasonably small .",
