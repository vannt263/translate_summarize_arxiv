    "in spite of the great succes of the standard model ( sm ) we still do not have a unified description of all the four known forces in a finite , renormalizable theory .",
    "therefore new phenomena are expected beyond the sm at some energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "today only elements of this ultimate theory are available and are proposed for experimental tests . in the present paper i have chosen an arbitrary list of these tests addressed by two active colliders , tevatron and hera : _ extra dimensions ( ed ) , supersymmetry ( susy ) , z , leptoquarks , beyond sm higgs bosons , and substructures of quarks and leptons . _",
    "the confrontation of these models with experiment is complemented by a _",
    "systematic search _ for departures from the sm .",
    "concerning the scale @xmath0 , its natural value would be the planck - mass , @xmath1 if one is aiming at unification with gravity .",
    "however the very large value of @xmath1 , in comparison with the electro - weak scale leads to `` unnatural '' fine tuning of scalar masses , known as the _ hierarchy problem_. some of the above topics present solution to this problem .    frequently , the same event topology , like e.g. high mass lepton pairs , allows to test several theoretical models .    in the tevatron collider at fermilab , near chicago , protons collide with antiprotons at a center - of - mass energy of 1960 gev .",
    "two experiments are collecting data , cdf and d .",
    "both experiments as well as the tevatron underwent substantial upgrades in the last decade . in the new data taking periode (",
    "run ii ) started in spring 2001 , the tevatron has delivered already 3 times more luminosity as in run i. the detector upgrades allow efficient operation at the increased luminosity , provide extended coverage of subdetectors and in the case of d  a completely new central tracking . in this paper only the most recent results from run ii will be reviewed making use of typically 200 pb@xmath2 integrated luminosity .    in the hera collider at desy , near hamburg ,",
    "positrons or electrons collide with protons at 300 ( or 318 ) gev energy in the center of mass .",
    "the data are collected by two experiments , h1 and zeus . here again , the collider as well as the two detectors have been upgraded .",
    "the new periode of data taking ( hera ii ) has started recently with the goal to collect 10 times more luminosity as in hera i and with a possibility of using longitudinally polarized electron beam . in this paper only results from hera i will be covered since results with comparable statistics from the new data taking periode hasnt been published yet .",
    "all limits are quoted at 95% confidence level .",
    "references for theoretical models can be found in those quoted for experimental results .",
    "as theodor klauza has shown the first time , almost a century ago , extra dimensions ( ed ) can provide a framework for unification with gravity .",
    "ed s were supposed to be compact of a very small size ( oscar klein ) since we do nt sense them in our everyday experiences .",
    "particles propagating in compact ed s have higher mass replica s , the so - called klauza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "recently , ed s revived interest since their existence is needed in string theories , and also because it was pointed out that their size can be large ( led ) , and therefore accessible for experimental verification . moreover , led s explain that gravity is only apparently weak and the scale of new physics can be much lower than the plank mass , thereby avoiding the hierarchy problem .",
    "ed s can be tested experimentally on colliders either by virtual effects or direct emission of the kk - states .",
    "led s can be of macroscopic size if only gravity is supposed to propagate in them .",
    "indeed , gravity experiments have tested newton s law only down to @xmath3 m distances .",
    "the _ virtual effects of the graviton kk - states _ show up at hadron colliders e.g. as deviation in the distribution of the invariant mass , @xmath4 and that of the angle @xmath5 in the center of mass of di - lepton and di - photon states .",

    "such a possibility can lead to spectacular minima and secondary maxima in the di - lepton invariant mass distribution due to the interference of the kk states of gauge bosons .",
