    "currently , lots of theoretical models were proposed to explain the accelerating of the universe , which is convinced by many observations . in some of the models",
    ", people proposed a new kind of dark energy component with negative pressure in our universe , which will drive the acceleration , and the simplest dark energy model is the cosmological constant , but it suffers fine - tuning and coincidence problems . while , in other models , people try to modify the einstein gravity at large scale in the universe , e.g. @xmath0 , dgp , etc .",
    "model , then the universe can be accelerated without introducing dark energy .",
    "recently , a very interesting dark energy model called veneziano ghost dark energy has been proposed @xcite , and in this model , one can obtain a cosmological constant of just the right magnitude to give the observed expansion from the contribution of the ghost fields , which are supposed to be present in the low - energy effective theory of qcd without introducing any new degrees of freedom .",
    "the ghosts are needed to solve the @xmath1 problem , but they are completely decoupled from the physical sector @xcite .",
    "the ghosts make no contribution in the flat minkowski space , but make a small energy density contribution to the vacuum energy due to the off - set of the cancellation of their contribution in curved space or time - dependent background .",
    "for example , in the rindler space , the contribution of high frequency modes is suppressed by the factor @xmath2 and the main contribution comes from @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the temperature on the horizon seen by the rindler observer @xcite . in the cosmological context",
    ", one can choice @xmath5 , which corresponds to the temperature on the hubble horizon .",
    "then , in the context of strongly interacting confining qcd with topological nontrivial sector , this effect occurs only in the time direction and their wave function in other space directions is expected to have the size of qcd energy scale .",
    "thus , this ghost gives the vacuum energy density proportional to @xmath6 . with @xmath7ev",
    ", it gives the right order of observed magnitude @xmath8ev)@xmath9 of the energy density .",
    "it should be emphasized that the veneziano ghost from the ghost dark energy model is not a new propagating physical degree of freedom and the description of dark energy in terms of the veneziano ghost is just a matter of convenience to describe very complicated infrared dynamics of strongly coupled qcd and it does not violate unitarity , causality , gauge invariance and other important features of renormalizable quantum field theory , see @xcite .    generally , it is very difficult to accept the linear behavior that the energy of frw universe is linear in hubble constant `` h '' , because qcd is a theory with a mass gap determined by the energy scale @xmath10mev .",
    "so , it is generally expected that there should be an exponentially small corrections rather than that linear corrections h. however , as the arguments discussed in refs.@xcite that the linear scaling h is due to the complicated topological structure of strongly coupled qcd , not related to the physical massive propagating degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , the linear in hubble constant h scaling has a strong theoretical support tested in a number of models . for recent paper on fitting the ghost dark energy model with current observational data including snia , bao , cmb , bbn , hubble parameter and growth rate of matter perturbation , see @xcite and also see @xcite . for recent progress on dark energy , see @xcite .",
    "einstein equations can be written in a form called `` unified first law '' based on the general definition of black hole dynamics on trapping horizon , which was proposed by hayward @xcite .",
    "there are some other horizons in the context of the frw universe , such as the future inner trapping horizon defined in the next section , while the outer one is used to define black holes in a general spacetime including time - dependent spacetime @xcite .",
    "so , in this paper , we will choice @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the temperature defined on the trapping horizon of the frw universe instead to study its dynamical behavior locally and globally .",
    "in addition , we also study the bifurcation phenomenon in this dynamical system and predict the fate of the universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec::as ] , we shall derive the equations of the autonomous system of the universe with ghost dark energy component , and investigate its properties and solutions qualitatively and numerically in sec.[d2pp ] .",
    "the global behavior of this system will be presented in sec.[sec::gb ] , and we also make a prediction of the fate of the universe in sec.[fou ] and study its bifurcation phenomenon in sec.[sec::bir ] . in the last section , we will give some discussions and conclusions .",
    "the spacetime of our universe is described by the frw metric , which could be written in the form of @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which is the radius of the sphere while @xmath17 is the scale factor . defining @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spacial curvature ,",
    "the metric could be rewritten as a double - null form @xmath20 then we get the trapping horizon @xmath21 by solving the equation @xmath22 as @xmath23 which coincides with the apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "the surface gravity is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 where dot and prime denote the derivative with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "here , we assume @xmath28 so that @xmath29 corresponding to inner trapping horizon .    as we mentioned before",
    ", one can simply choice the temperature on the horizon as @xmath30 in the cosmological context , but this is a special choice and generally , in the context of dynamical spacetime , the temperature is well - defined on the trapping horizon , which is proportional to the surface gravity on that horizon , namely @xmath31 .",
    "actually , it will reduce to @xmath30 in the de sitter spacetime when we neglect the spatial curvature , because the trapping horizon is coincident with the hubble horizon in this situation . in the following",
    ", we will also take the idea of the ghost dark energy model , in which the vacuum energy density is proportional to the temperature defined on the trapping horizon @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the energy density of the veneziano ghost dark energy is then given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant and here we have used eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) .",
    "the friedmann equation now reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the energy density of dark matter , and by solving the friedmann equation , we get @xmath37 \\,.\\ ] ]    usually , people also consider case that dark energy and dark matter are coupled to each other by adding a interaction term in the conservation equations  @xcite .",
    "of course , the entirely independent evolution of the dark energy is a special case with a vanished interaction term .",
    "furthermore , the microphysics seems to allow enough room for the coupling between the two components . at leat , before drawing a definitely conclusion , the interaction case is still deserved to study .",
    "however , once a generic interaction term is introduced , the dynamical equations would become much more complicated and can not be solved analytically .",
    "as we known , by using the locally dynamical analysis , one can get the future behavior of the nonlinear system and know whether the system is stable or not near the critical points .",
    "but , this method can only give the neighborhood properties of the critical points .",
    "so , in the following , we will develop a global method to study the global behavior of the nonlinear dynamical system , as well as its bifurcation phenomenon .",
    "as we known , the conservation equations including a general interaction between the dark energy and dark matter is described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the interacting term , and we will take its form as @xmath40 in the following . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are some constants . usually , the existing literature only consider a simple case @xmath43 or @xmath44 , as well as the case @xmath45 , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "we will see that , once we have developed a global analysis method , it would be unnecessarily to set these special values , and there would be a interesting bifurcation phenomenon when one leaves these parameters free .",
    "the equation of state parameter of dark energy then be derived as @xmath46 by using eqs .",
    "( [ fried ] ) , ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath47 and we also have the relation @xmath48    by using the following set of dimensionless variables @xmath49 then , the friedmann equation ( [ fried ] ) can be written as @xmath50 which indicates that all terms in the above equation take values in the interval @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the equation of state parameter ( [ eos ] ) could be rewritten in terms of new variables as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ratio of energy density of dark energy to dark matter , i.e. @xmath54 , and the deceleration parameter @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where we have used the constraint ( [ constr ] ) to get the last equality of the above equation . by using eq .",
    "( [ f31 ] ) and ( [ f32 ] ) , one can get the relation @xmath57 thus , the dynamical equations can be written in the following form @xmath58(\\mu+1)\\ , ,   \\label{d1}\\\\      \\epsilon ' & = & ( 1-\\epsilon ) \\bigg[2\\epsilon + 3\\alpha+3\\left(\\beta-1+\\frac{4\\epsilon}{3 } \\right)\\mu\\bigg ] \\",

    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) constitute an autonomous system and we shall study the properties of its solutions qualitatively and numerically , for some recent works on locally dynamic analysis see ref .",
    "@xcite , and also see @xcite for a review .    before ending this section",
    ", we would like to point out that the computation of the speed of sound should not be treated as a signal for instability of the theory as the veneziano ghost is not a propagating physical degree of freedom .",
    "such an `` apparent signal for instability '' is in fact a result of treatment of the veneziano ghost as the conventional physical degree of freedom satisfying classical equation of motion .",
    "appropriate interpretation is that a notion of the speed of sound does not exist for a non - physical , non- propagating degree of freedom .",
    "this viewpoint was adapted in recent paper , see @xcite .",
    "the critical points of the autonomous system can be obtained by setting @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "all the critical points are listed in coordinate @xmath61 in tab.[table : cp ] .",
    ".[table : cp ] all the critical points ( c.p . ) and their physical conditions ( p.c . ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general , a bifurcation occurs when there is a remarkably change in the structure of the solutions of the dynamical system as the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the simplest types of bifurcation occurs when the property of equilibrium solutions changes as @xmath41 and @xmath42 vary .",
    "thus , a bifurcation may be appearance when the parameters vary from some domain into neighbor one .",
    "for example , the structure of @xmath62-@xmath63 changes from saddle - saddle to saddle - sink and the structure of @xmath64-@xmath65 changes from sink - saddle to saddle - saddle when the location of @xmath66 crosses the line @xmath67 , namely , @xmath66 moves from domain viii to ix in the @xmath41-@xmath42 plane .",
    "in the section [ d2pp ] , we have used the technique of linearization to determine the behavior of solutions near physical points . in this section ,",
    "we use the qualitative technique of nullcline for analyzing the global behavior of nonlinear system , which is one of the most useful tools for analyzing solutions of nonlinear planar system . for our system ,",
    "the @xmath53-nullclines are the set of points determined by @xmath68 similarly , the @xmath69-nullclines are the set of points determined by @xmath70 it is worth noting that the nullclines consist of lines and hyperbolas .",
    "the asymptotes of hyperbola in eq .",
    "( [ munull ] ) are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which is interesting to determine the fate of universe .    on the @xmath53-nullclines , we have @xmath73 , the vector field points @xmath74 are vertical , so @xmath53-nullclines divide @xmath53-@xmath69 plane into regions where the vector field points either to the left or to the right .",
    "similarly , the @xmath69-nullclines separate the plane into regions where the vector field points either upward or downward .",
    "if we determine all of the nullclines , then this allows us to decompose @xmath53-@xmath69 plane into a collection of basic regions .",
    "the vector field must point in one of @xmath75 directions ( northeast , northwest , southeast or southwest ) for any of the basic regions between the nullclines , since it is neither vertical nor horizontal . in each of basic regions , the vector field points",
    "are provided with a certain direction .",
    "therefore , the basic regions allow us to understand the phase portrait from a qualitative point of view .",
    "furthermore , the nullclines are depending on the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 in our dynamical system , so we have to discuss each of domains i - xi separately .    here , we discuss domain i and xi in detail , since there are two physical critical points @xmath62 and @xmath63 in these domains . in the case of @xmath76 domain",
    "i , the nullclines divide @xmath53-@xmath69 plane into @xmath77 basic regions in fig.[fig2a ] . by taking one point in each of these regions firstly and then deciding the direction of the vector field at that point",
    ", we can determine the direction of the vector field at all points in the basic region .",
    "similarly , the nullclines also divide @xmath53-@xmath69 plane into @xmath77 basic regions for the case of @xmath76 domain xi , see fig.[fig2b ] , and we can decide the direction of the vector field at all points in the basic region . especially , we can find out the approximate behavior of solutions everywhere in the plane , which has interest for the discussion of physical significance .",
    "for example , we will know that the matter component is a dominant position at late evolution if any solution tends toward infinity in the basic region marked a(b ) in fig.[fig2b ] with the northeast ( southeast ) direction .",
    "in other words , we will know the fate of universe and its initial conditions .",

    "we also plot evolution trajectories when @xmath78 domain i in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the physical admissible range is the only right - half plane ( @xmath79 ) , so we must choose initial conditions at the right - half plane .",
    "the detailed discussion of the physical arguments will appear in section [ fou ] .",
    "from fig.[fig3 ] , one can see that if @xmath80 belongs domain i , and the initial values of @xmath53 and @xmath69 satisfy the following condition @xmath81 i.e. the initial point ( @xmath82 ) belongs to a @xmath83 b ( a denotes the yellow region , while b denotes the green region ) , the universe will evolve to matter dominate finally , which suggests that the expansion will asymptotically come to a halt .",

    ", we also plot evolution trajectories in the @xmath53-@xmath69 plane for @xmath102 and @xmath103 in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "obviously , @xmath62 changes into a sink from a source as the parameters @xmath80 run in domain ii from domain i , and @xmath62 also becomes a non - physical point .",
