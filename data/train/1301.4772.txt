    "in contrast , the spin splitting for the heavy - hole sub - bands is given by @xmath84 the @xmath85 and @xmath86 dependence for the heavy - hole sub - bands is because the heavy - hole sub - bands carry the angular momentum @xmath87 .        in the basis @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with the shear strains @xmath34 and @xmath41 and the coefficient @xmath89 . @xmath34 and @xmath41 have even parity and @xmath90 carry the angular momentum @xmath91 .",

    "<S> in a two - dimensional electron gas , the quantized hall conductance can be induced by a strong magnetic field , known as the quantum hall effect , and it can also result from the strong exchange coupling of magnetic ions , dubbed as the `` quantum anomalous hall effect '' . </S>",

    "<S> we find this condition is not necessary and predict that the quantum anomalous hall effect can also be induced by the purely in - plane magnetization in two realistic systems , including bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin film with magnetic doping and hgmnte quantum wells with shear strains , when all the reflection symmetries are broken . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental setup is proposed to confirm this effect , the observation of which will pave the way to search for the quantum anomalous hall effect in a wider range of materials .    </S>",
    "<S> for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in an out - of - plane magnetic field , a transverse voltage can be driven by the lorentz force felt by electrons , known as the hall effect , which was first discovered by e.h . </S>",
    "<S> hall in 1879@xcite . later , hall also observed the stronger transverse voltage in ferromagnetic conductors with an out - of - plane magnetization , dubbed as the anomalous hall effect@xcite , where the hall effect is induced by the exchange coupling of magnetic ions . </S>",
    "<S> the hall effect has its quantum version , the quantum hall effect , in which the out - of - plane magnetic field is essential to form laudau levels and obtain the quantized hall conductance . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , it is realized that the anomalous hall effect also has its quantum version , dubbed as the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect@xcite , where the quantized hall conductance origins from the exchange coupling of magnetic ions instead of landau levels of the out - of - plane magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> recently , several realistic systems , including mn doped hgte quantum wells@xcite , magnetic impurities doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 thin films@xcite , gdbite@xmath1 thin films@xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_@xcite , have been proposed for the qah effect and a large experimental effort have been made to persue the realization of this effect@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum hall effect originates from the orbital effect of magnetic fields due to the landau levels , which require the magnetic field along the z direction . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , it is also commonly believed that the qah effect requires z - direction magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> in - plane magnetic fields can not induce the orbital effect , however exchange couplings still exist for the in - plane magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of time reversal ( tr ) symmetry , which is a necessary condition for the non - zero hall conductance , occurs for any direction and any type of magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no constraint to limit the realization of the qah effect with the in - plane magnetization . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the out - of - plane magnetization is not necessary and the qah effect can also be induced by a purely in - plane magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two realistic systems to realize the in - plane magnetization induced qah effect , which are accessible in the present experimental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from a general symmetry analysis of the necessary conditions for the appearance of non - zero hall conductance . </S>",
    "<S> first , the hall conductance must be zero in a tr invariant system , so a magnetic field or magnetization is required . </S>",
    "<S> besides tr symmetry , the 2d point group ( pg ) symmetry gives an additional constraint for the hall conductance , as first shown by fang@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d pgs consist of two families , the n - fold rotation symmetry @xmath2 and the n - fold dihedral symmetry @xmath3@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dihedral group @xmath3 in 2d pgs is generated by the rotation @xmath2 and the reflection @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> here we emphasize that reflection @xmath4 in 2d pgs always corresponds to the reflection in three dimenional ( 3d ) pgs with the reflection plane perpendicular to the 2d plane . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection in 2d pgs plays the role of inversion in 3d and distinguishes the pseudo - scalar ( pseudo - vector ) from the scalar ( vector ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hall conductance is zero if the 2d system has any reflection symmetry @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , let s consider a system with the reflection symmetry @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) in the 2d plane , denoted as xy plane . </S>",
    "<S> for the hall response @xmath7 , under @xmath5 the current @xmath8 changes its sign ( @xmath9 ) while the electric field @xmath10 keeps its sign , so the hall response equation is changed to @xmath11 . if the system is invariant under @xmath5 , the response equation should also be invariant under @xmath5 , constraining the hall conductance @xmath12 to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments can be applied to any 2d reflection symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the out - of - plane magnetization is a pseudo - scalar in the 2d pgs , breaking any reflection symmetry @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the in - plane magnetization , denoted as @xmath13 , is a pseudo - vector , and there is still a surviving reflection symmetry @xmath14 with the reflection plane perpendicular to @xmath13 , thus the in - plane magnetization by itself can not induce a non - zero hall conductance and it is necessary to introduce other mechanisms to break the remaining reflection symmetry @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry analysis gives us a guidance to search for the non - zero hall conductance with in - plane magnetization and in below , we will present two realistic systems , in which not only the non - zero hall conductance , but also the quantum anomalous hall effect can be realized with in - plane magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> * bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin film with magnetic doping *    our first example is the bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin film with magnetic doping , which possesses the qah effect with an out - of - plane magnetization@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the qah effect can also be induced by the in - plane magnetization in this system once we take into account the three - fold warping term@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy physics of a magnetically doped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin film is dominated by the two surface states on the top and bottom surfaces , with the hamiltonian given by@xcite @xmath15 in the basis @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is for the top ( bottom)surface and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is for spin up ( spin down ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli matrices @xmath24 denote spin operators and @xmath25 represent the surface states on the top ( bottom ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> we take the growth direction of the thin film as @xmath26 and the film plane as the xy plane . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is the kinetic term with the fermi velocity @xmath27 , the second term is the three - fold warping term with the parameter @xmath28@xcite and the third term gives the spin splitting characterized by the parameters @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman type of spin splitting can originate from the direct zeeman coupling between electron spin and magnetic fields , or from the exchange coupling between electron spin and magnetization of magnetic ions . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of @xmath30 is along the in - plane magnetization @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization between two surface states@xcite is neglected here , which is not essential for our discussion below . </S>",
    "<S> the qah effect has been studied for this model when @xmath31@xcite , and here we focus on the case when both the in - plane magnetization and the warping term are non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> the warping term breaks the full in - plane rotation symmetry down to the three - fold rotation ( @xmath32 ) symmetry along @xmath26 , which coincides with the symmetry of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 lattice in fig . 1a .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < \" , ]     fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a shows the band gap for the hamiltonian @xmath33 as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 with a finite in - plane magnetization @xmath36 . when @xmath37 , the hall conductance is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath35 , as obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system is metallic for @xmath40 , separating the two qah phases with opposite hall conductances . with a finite @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , we find the gapless line derives away from the line of @xmath40 and the regime with positive ( negative ) @xmath34 and @xmath40 is adiabatically connected to the regime with positive ( negative ) @xmath35 , which indicates that the hall conductance for a postive ( negative ) @xmath34 is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , as shown in fig . 3a . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , the band gap is plotted as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath41 with a finite @xmath36 , and a gapless line along @xmath37 separates two qah phases with the hall conductance @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the hall conductance vanishes along the gapless line , because both the shear strain @xmath41 and the in - plane magentization @xmath43 preserves the reflection @xmath44 . more generally , the hall cnductance is always zero when two vectors , the shear strain @xmath45 and the in - plane magnetization @xmath13 , are perpendicular to each other . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the shear strain @xmath46 is a tensor in 3d pgs , but we can treat @xmath47 as a vector in 2d pgs . according to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , we can consider the experimental configuration for the magnetization and shear strain for the hgmnte quantum wells , similar to that of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films , as shown in fig 3c . </S>",
    "<S> when the angle @xmath48 between the strain vector @xmath47 and the magnetization vector @xmath13 is rotated across @xmath49 or @xmath50 , the hall conductance switches between @xmath42 of the two insulating phases . in fig 3d , we verify the stability of the qah phases for different values of @xmath51 and the qah phase always exists when the in - plane magnetization is large enough .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion and conclusion *    from the above two examples , we find that the breaking of reflection symmetry is essential for the in - plane magnetization induced qah effect . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the pseudo - scalar , such as the out - of - plane magnetization , can break all the reflection symmetries in 2d pgs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one should also construct a pseudo - scalar with the in - plane magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a pseudo - scalar , the dot product of a vector and a pseudo - vector @xmath52 , can be defined to characterize the hall conductance in the hgmnte quantum wells with shear strains . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d , the sign of the hall conductance is determined by the sign of the product of @xmath34 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this strategy can also be applied to search for the qah phase in other systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose the experiments with rotating in - plane magnetic fields , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c , to confirm the predicted effect . </S>",
    "<S> since no out - of - plane magnetization is required , the orbital effect from landau levels of magnetic fields can be excluded completely . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the proposed setups can provide a clear experimental signal to distinguish the orbital effect of magnetic fields from the exchange effect of magnetic ions . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal is also feasible in experiments since cr or mn doped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 films or mn doped hgte quantum wells have already been realized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , ferromagnetic materials are usually metallic , preventing the appearance of the qah effect which requires insulating materials . </S>",
    "<S> the existing ferromagnetic insulators , such as euo and gdn , have the in - plane magnetization for a thin film configuration@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the in - plane magnetization induced qah effect will pave the way to the new qah materials with the hybrid structures made of ferromagnetic insulators . </S>"
