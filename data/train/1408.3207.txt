    "galaxy - scale outflows ( sometimes called superwinds ) driven by supernovae ( sne ) are ubiquitous in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such outflows represent a primary mechanism of stellar feedback , which injects energetic and chemically enriched materials into the circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) or even the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "the outflows consist of multiphases , including x - ray - emitting thermal plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , warm ionized gas @xcite , neutral atomic / molecular gas , and dust @xcite , as shown in m82  the target galaxy of the present study .    as a prototype starburst - driven outflow ,",
    "m82 has received some of the most extensive studies of individual galaxies .",
    "the salient parameters of the galaxy are listed in table  [ tab : info ] .",
    "the outflow from the nuclear region of the galaxy extends at least 3 kpc away on both sides from the galactic disk along its minor axis .",
    "it is widely assumed that the outflow is driven by volume - filling hot plasma , while cold and warm gases are entrained within the flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "little is actually known about the origin of the emission lines and hence about the properties of the hot plasma and its interplay with the cool components .",
    "the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath50.5 - 1 kev ) , in particular , may arise from either the volume - filling hot outflow @xcite or mostly from the cool - hot gas interface with a very low volume - filling factor @xcite . without separating these very different contributions",
    ", one can not determine the energetics , as well as the thermal and chemical properties of the hot plasma , hence the potential role of the outflow in regulating the evolution of the galaxy and its environment .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectroscopy offers an opportunity to greatly advance our understanding of galactic outflows .",
    "here we use the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) observations of m82 to demonstrate this potential .",
    "although the x - ray emission from the galaxy is extended , the large wavelength dispersion of the rgs still allows us to detect or resolve key individual x - ray emission lines or complexes , such as k@xmath0 triplets of he - line ions , with confusion far less than that in an x - ray ccd spectrum ( e.g. , extracted from /european photon imaging camera ( epic ) data ) .",
    "indeed , existing studies with the rgs data have already demonstrated the diagnostic power of the line spectroscopy . in the analysis of a 50 ks rgs observation of m82 , @xcite found that the  ly@xmath0 line and the  k@xmath0 triplet can not be appropriately accounted for even with a multi - temperature thermal plasma model and argued that the  triplet may indicate a significant contribution from charge exchange ( cx )  @xcite .",
    "this process occurs when an ion captures an electron from a neutral atom or molecule .",
    "the captured electron tends to be in an excited state ; the subsequent downward cascades can produce emission lines with relative intensities distinctly different from a collisionally excited plasma @xcite .",
    "@xcite quantified the cx contributions by analyzing individual line components of the k@xmath0 triplets of helium - like o , ne and mg ions .",
    "because of the electron capture , cx contributes to the line emission from lower ionization states than in equilibrium thermal plasma ; in the case of multiple cx reactions , the emission appears at increasingly lower ionization states .",
    "therefore , the spectral analysis of the emission arising even partly from the cx could lead to very misleading results on the temperature and chemical properties of the plasma , if only its thermal ( collisionally - excited ) emission is considered .",
    "cx may also contribute significantly to the enhanced x - ray emission from the so - called outflow cap , projected at 11.6 kpc away from the galactic disk of m82 @xcite .",
    "this x - ray enhancement coincides with an h@xmath0-emitting filament @xcite , which is also seen in ultraviolet emission due to the reflection by dust @xcite .",
    "although the x - ray ccd spectra obtained from  and  observations are well characterized by two - temperature components of optically - thin thermal plasma , it has been suggested that some of the observed emission lines could be due to the cx  @xcite .    in this paper , we take a step further to model the entire rgs spectrum of m82 , accounting for both thermal and cx contributions simultaneously .",
    "we assume a volume - filling , single - temperature , optically - thin plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium , which is responsible for the thermal emission , and an interface of the plasma with cool gas , where the cx occurs .",
    "this simple model is particularly motivated by the development of an integrated cx spectral code @xcite .",
    "we check how well the rgs spectrum can be fitted with the model and what constraints can be obtained on the effectiveness of the cx process or the effective interface area , as well as the properties of the thermal plasma .",
    "we further apply the model to the analysis of an /epic - pn spectrum of the cap region to check the consistency of the model and to infer the dynamics of the outflow .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we describe the rgs data and model in sections 2 and 3 , we present the fitting results in section 4 and explore their implications in section 5 , characterizing the key parameters of the hot gas outflow and its interplay with the cool gas .",
    "the present study uses the longest ( 104 ks )  observation ( i d : 0206080101 ) of m82 . after removing time intervals of high background with a counting rate above 0.2 counts s@xmath6 in the energy band above 10 kev ,",

    "the model assumes the most probable cx process that only a single electron is captured by an ion .",
    "the process can be represented by @xmath26 where a highly ionized ion @xmath27 ( such as  and ) picks up an electron from a neutral species n ( h , @xmath28 , and/or he ) , producing an excited ion @xmath29 , which emits x - ray photons as it decays to the ground state .",
    "the emission spectrum depends on the relative @xmath30 and @xmath31 distribution of the captured electrons , which affects the transitions during the subsequent electron cascade to the ground state .",
    "the principal @xmath30 shell for the electron capture is determined from equation 2.6 of @xcite .",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath31 is more complex : several distributions are available , each roughly corresponding to different center - of - mass velocities of the system . at lower collision energies ,",
    "the separable @xmath31 distribution is suitable ( equation 3.59 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . once captured , the electron cascades down to the ground state , purely by spontaneous or two photon emission .",
    "the model calculation includes a complete set of ions and radiative transitions based on the atomdb database @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculated emission spectrum can then be directly compared to an observed one .",
    "we consider two extreme electron capture modes regarding to whether or not an ion can have at most one cx . in one case ,",
    "we assume that only one electron is captured .",
    "this is for cx in a sea of ions meeting occasional individual neutral atoms which have penetrated into the hot `` wind '' , a circumstance suitable for the solar wind @xcite . in another case ,",
    "the `` standard '' one , multiple cx captures occur rapidly until the ion becomes neutral , an assumption justified by the large cross section for cx - typically several orders of magnitude higher than the electron - ion collisional excitation cross sections .",
    "the difference between the two cases is mainly reflected by the h- and he - like ion ratios ( due to one or two cx captures ) for c , n , o , and ne .",
    "the prominent lines from li - like ions are usually with energies lower than 0.3 kev , therefore are not in an rgs spectrum .",
    "the cold gas in the outflow of m82 is either clouds entrained by the hot gas or the inflows due to the interaction with m81 @xcite . in the infrared band image of m82 ,",
    "the thickness of the filaments and shells of the cold gas are normally on the scale of several 10 pc @xcite , much greater than the mean free path of the cx that occurs at the immediate vicinity of the interface due to its large cross - section ( typically a few @xmath32 ) .",
    "thus , the situation in m82 is probably more suitable for the multiple cx case , in which the normalization parameter is physically meaningful as @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the angular diameter distance and the cosmic redshift of the target , while @xmath36 is the equivalent ( metal abundance - dependent ) hot proton incident rate ( in units of @xmath37 ) through the interface . when the normalization is determined in a fit to the observed spectrum , @xmath38",
    "can then be measured . furthermore ,",
    "if the proton density @xmath39 of the hot plasma and the velocity @xmath40 ( of ions relative to neutral atoms ) can be estimated , one can then infer the the effective area of the interface in the spectral extraction region .",
    "we use the xspec convolution model rgsxsrc to account for the spectral broadening caused by the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission .",
    "we approximate the energy - dependent distribution using two high - resolution diffuse x - ray intensity images , constructed from mosaicing 30  acis observations of m82 in the 6 - 18   ( hard ) and 20 - 30   ( soft ) bands and smoothed with a gaussian filter of fwhm=5@xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ fig : conv]a shows that the x - ray intensity is quite concentrated ( within the inner 1.5 arcmin radius ) in the hard band and is considerably more extended in the soft band .",
    "the lack of the emission near the galactic disk in this soft band is due to the strong photoelectric absorption by the interstellar medium ( ism ) in m82 .",
    "the convolution of the rgsxsrc model uses the same dispersion center coordinates and position angle as for the rgs spectrum , as well as an aperture radius of 4 arcmin , as suggested by @xcite , to cover the bulk of the emission from the outflow .",
    "figure  [ fig : conv]b demonstrates the spectral line broadenings as predicted from the above described convolution of a gaussian emission line ( 12  ) with a turbulent velocity of 100 .",
    "the hard band image , where the thermal emission dominates , is used for the convolution with the apec model .",
    "the cx contribution@xcite becomes increasingly important and even dominates at longer wavelengths .",
    "thus the cx model is convolved with the soft band image .",

    "in particular , the  forbidden line is well fitted by the cx contribution .",

    "table  [ tab : pars ] includes our best fit model parameters and their uncertainties at the 90% statistical confidence level .",

    "[ tab : flux ] , we further compare the fluxes of the continuum , thermal , and cx components of the model .",

    "the cx to total line flux ratio ranges from 87% for the  triplet to less than 3% for  ( 16.9  ) .",

    "in particular , iron is believed to have the greatest fraction of its atoms depleted into dust grains in cold gas @xcite . but dust grains are expected to be destroyed in shocks or sputtered gradually by collisions with electrons in hot gas .",
    "a substantial metal depletion in the hot plasma of m82 then suggests that a large fraction of its dust grains did nt pass a strong shock ( e.g. , only mass - loaded gently at the interface ) and has not been in the hot phase for long ( as may be expected for the outflow ) .    to estimate the density and energetics of the plasma",
    ", we need to know its volume .",
    "the plasma is considered to be contained approximately in a bi - conic outflow with a half cone opening angle of @xmath76 and a height of @xmath53 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] ; @xcite ) , roughly corresponding to the enhanced x - ray region sampled by the rgs data .",
    "the total volume of the hot gas is then : @xmath77 where the @xmath78 is the solid angle of each cone opening , and @xmath79 is the distance from the galactic center to the top of each cone ( assumed to be part of a ball ) .",
    "the top surface area of the two cones is @xmath80    with the above volume estimate , we may now infer the mean density of the plasma from the normalization of the apec model : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( table  [ tab : info ] ) is the distance of m82 .",
    "approximating the hot plasma to be homogeneous in the bi - conical outflow , we estimate @xmath84 .",
    "the total mass of the hot plasma is @xmath85 . considering the mass deposition rate of @xmath86 (   5.1 )",
    ", the total mass suggests a period of about 1.4 myr for the deposition of input materials .",
    "together with the temperature measurement ( table  [ tab : pars ] ) , we infer the mean thermal pressure of the plasma as @xmath87 .",
    "this pressure is about 2 - 20% of the value in the very central region ( @xmath88 pc ) of m82 , @xmath89 @xcite , and roughly corresponds to the pressure at the radius around 500 pc in the super - wind model @xcite .",
    "with the cx contribution characterized , we can estimate the total incident rate of ions onto the interface and its effective area in the outflow region . from the normalization of the cx model ( table  [ tab : pars ] )",
    ", we infer the ion incident rate as @xmath90 , or about 80 @xmath91 hot ions per year .",
    "together with our model temperature , it implies that the cx involves a thermal energy of about @xmath92 ( including the contribution from electrons ) , which is comparable to the total expected mechanical energy input from sws and sne of about @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the cx is a manifestation of the substantial heat exchange between the hot and cool gases .",
    "according to the conventional superwind modeling of the outflow from m82 , the hot gas in the outflow region would have a velocity @xmath94  , while the entrained cool gas moves slowly ( e.g. , @xmath5 500 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in reality , the free expanding superwind modeling may work only partly in m82 , perhaps in the northern side of the galaxy @xcite , which is evidenced by the presence of the cap @xcite .",
    "a good fraction of the hot plasma , especially in the southern side of the galaxy , seems to be morphologically enclosed by cool gas , as seen in images of h@xmath0 , dust radiation , and x - ray .",
    "nevertheless , a good approximation of the relative velocity may be @xmath95500 , comparable to the sound velocity of the hot plasma .",
    "then with @xmath96 , as obtained above for the hot plasma , we estimate the total effective area of the interface as @xmath97 .",
    "this area is about one order of magnitude larger than the summed cross - section of the two cones , consistent with the turbulent nature of the interface around cool gas clouds / filaments embedded in the hot plasma , and along the outer boundaries of the cones .",
    "the enlarged interface confines the outflow from free - expanding , and makes the mass - loading into the hot gas efficient @xcite .",
    "how various potential astrophysical processes actually occur at the cool / hot interface remains somewhat uncertain .",
    "a layer of turbulent mixing may exist over the interface region driven by various instabilities , with a characteristic length scale of a few parsecs @xcite .",
    "also turbulence by its nature generates eddies cascading from macroscopic scales down to smaller ones .",
    "the processes such as cx and thermal conduction can operate efficiently on those microscopic scales . for a typical cx length scale of @xmath98 ,",
    "the saturated thermal conduction by electrons may occur on time scales of about one year @xcite .",
    "given the relative velocity as 500 , the cx occurs on a similar time scale . unlike thermal conduction , neutral atoms can move across magnetic fields or can thus be shaken out cool gas clouds in a highly turbulent environment , resulting microscopic mixing of gases in different phases .",
    "in particular , since the ionization time scale of hydrogen is about ten years , the cx can proceed efficiently .",
    "the cap potentially provides the cleanest site to test the cx scenario and to probe the properties of the outflow from m82 . at a distance sufficiently far from the starburst nucleus of the galaxy , this distinct feature should have a relatively uniform foreground absorption , which remains a systematic uncertainty in the analysis of the outflow region , and is largely free from contamination of discrete sources .",
    "most importantly , the morphology of the reflected uv radiation , as well as those of the x - ray and h@xmath0 emissions , all indicate that a discrete interface exists between the relatively isolated cool gas filament and the hot outflow , which is otherwise difficult to detect at the large distance from the galactic disk .",
    "the impact of the outflow on the filament should naturally lead to the cx , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "although the existing x - ray observations provide no distinct spectral line signature to quantify the cx contribution , the overall spectral consistency of the filament with the outflow is encouraging .",
    "the results from the cap and outflow regions together can further be used to place additional constraints on the properties of the outflow at the distance of the cap .",
    "similar to what we have done above for the outflow region near the disk (   5.2 ) , we can infer the ion incident rate into the cap as @xmath99 from the measured spectral normalization ( table  [ tab : pars ] ) .",
    "if we assume the outflow density of @xmath100 and the absolute velocity of @xmath51000  at 3 kpc , plus the solid angle of the cone @xmath101 , we may estimate the upper limit of the outflow ion particle flux as @xmath102 .",
    "together with the above ion incident rate and the off - galaxy center distance of the cap as 11.6 kpc , we infer the lower limit of its interacting surface area as @xmath103 .",
    "however , assuming the outflow - facing cap to be approximately a circle of 1.8@xmath104 radius @xcite , the surface area would be roughly @xmath105 .",
    "the discrepancy between the two areas indicates that either the cap is elongated along our line of sight .",
    "the presence of the cx naturally leads to the prediction of its contribution to the h@xmath0 emission , in addition to the soft x - ray line emission that we have focused on .",
    "a hot proton undergoing a cx has a @xmath106 probability to produce an h@xmath0 photon @xcite .",
    "for the outflow region , the above estimated hot proton incident rate , @xmath107 , can be translated into an h@xmath0 flux of @xmath108 , or @xmath109 .",
    "this cx contribution is about 3% of the observed h@xmath0 flux from the entire m82 @xcite and may be responsible for much of the broadest h@xmath0 line component with the measured fwhm = 333  ( table 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "this width is smaller than the thermal broadening of the 0.6 kev plasma with a fwhm of @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the mass of proton .",
    "but the velocity decomposition of the h@xmath0 line can be quite uncertain ( e.g. , sensitive to the specific way in which the observed line is decomposed ) .",
    "we may also expect that the shock driven into the cool gas from the impact of the high - speed outflow be responsible for part of the h@xmath0 emission , as well as the perhaps dominant contribution from the recombination of photoionized gas .",
    "but still , the broadest h@xmath0 component in the outflow region could be largely a result of the cx . in the cap region ,",
    "the cx contribution increases to 17% of the observed h@xmath0 flux .",
    "a spatial correlation between the diffuse x - ray and h@xmath0 emissions was noted previously in m82 and other nearby star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this correlation led to the impression that both the soft x - ray emission and the h@xmath0 emission may largely arise at boundaries between the hot and cold gases , occupying a small percentage of the space .",
    "but the specific mechanism for such interaction is not clear , although shock @xcite and thermal conductions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been proposed .",
    "even with an outflow velocity of @xmath112  , it is not clear that the forward - shock propagating into the entrained dense cool gas would be energetic enough to produce x - ray - emitting plasma .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the correlation is valid only globally ; locally the x - ray enhancements can be anti - correlated with h@xmath0 features @xcite .",
    "this anti - correlation can not easily be brought into a consistency with the shock heating interpretation .    in our model ,",
    "about a quarter of the total observed x - ray emission in the 0.4 - 2  kev band arises from the cx emission at the interface .",
    "this specific mechanism provides a natural explanation for the global correlation between the soft x - ray and h@xmath0 emissions , while the local anti - correlation is expected for the x - ray emission from volume - filling thermal plasma enclosed by h@xmath0-emitting cool gas .",
    "we have made the first attempt to characterize the soft x - ray emission from m82 with a simple physical spectral model .",
    "a novel component of this model is the implementation of the cx contribution , joined with a volume - filling , one - temperature , thermal plasma ( apec ) .",
    "this apec+cx model is used to fit both the entire rgs spectrum of the central outflow and the epic - pn spectrum of the cap region .",
    "we summarize the main results and conclusions as follows :    * the model fits the rgs spectrum of the outflow well to an accuracy of matching individual emission features typically within 25% .",
    "the fit shows that the cx is largely responsible for the enhanced forbidden lines of the k@xmath0 triplets of various he - like ions , and contributes substantially to the ly@xmath0 transitions of  ( @xmath1 ) ,  and  ( @xmath250% ) . about a quarter of the x - ray flux in the 6 - 30   band originates in the cx .",
    "furthermore , the required cx rate gives a direct estimate of the equivalent hot proton flux of @xmath107 , which undergoes the cx at the hot and cool gas interface .",
    "* the separation of the cx contribution improves the measurements of the thermal and chemical properties of the volume - filling plasma .",
    "the measured temperature of 0.6 kev is at the high end of the range inferred from the previous modeling with thermal plasma only , albeit with multiple temperature components .",
    "the mean density of the plasma is @xmath50.04 @xmath113 and its total mass is @xmath114 within the inner @xmath115  kpc region .",
    "our measured metal abundances are close to be solar ( typically within a factor of @xmath116 ) and show significant deviations from those based on thermal plasma - only modeling .",
    "the abundance pattern of x / fe is systematically higher than the nucleosynthetic yields of core - collapsed sne , suggesting fe depletion onto dust grains even in the hot plasma . * a substantial mass - loading , a factor of @xmath117 of the sn and sw injected mass injection , from cool gas to hot plasma",
    "is inferred over the entire outflow region sampled by the rgs .",
    "this mass - loading is required to explain the low temperature and high density of the plasma .",
    "the cx may just be a by - product of the mass - loading and may be responsible for much of the required heating of the cool gas , as indicated by a substantial energy flux involved in the process ( comparable to the total mechanical energy input from the stars ) . * assuming a characteristic relative velocity @xmath5500  ( comparable to the sound velocity of the hot gas ) between the hot and cool gases , we estimate the effective area of the interface as @xmath118 , or one order of magnitude larger than the geometrical cross - section of the bi - conic outflows at 3 kpc off the galactic nucleus .",
    "this large area of the interface is expected from the embedding of many cool gas clouds / filaments in the hot plasma and from the turbulent mixing between the two gas phases and can naturally accommodate substantial mass - loading to the hot plasma . *",
    "the epic spectrum of the cap , as the most natural location for the cx process , can be well characterized by the same apec+cx model ( that best - fits the rgs spectrum of the outflow region ) with a simple fitting to the normalizations .",
    "the cx contributes nearly half of the x - ray flux of the cap in the 6 - 30   band , which requires an ion incident rate of @xmath99 .",
    "the cap may be elongated along our line of sight to account for this ion incident rate .",
    "* our model naturally explains the global spatial correlation and some local anti - correlation between the x - ray and h@xmath0 emissions .",
    "the local anti - correlation , apparent only in some regions , likely reflects the fact that the volume - filling hot plasma is surrounded and possibly enclosed by cool ( h@xmath0-emitting ) gas across the bulk of the field .",
    "but the anti - correlation is weakened by the cx contribution to the x - ray emission , especially in the very soft x - ray band . on scales greater than individual bubbles / shells or other intermixing structures ,",
    "the global correlation is expected .",
    "while the overall intensity of the h@xmath0 emission is dominated by photoionization , plus shocking heating , the cx of hot protons with neutral atoms could still be considerable ( likely a few to twenty percent of the emission ) and may be largely responsible for the broadest component of the observed h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "while the main goal of the present work is to demonstrate the potential utility of the cx spectral model in characterizing the soft x - ray line emission from a starburst galaxy , clearly more work needs to be done .",
    "in particular , we have only modeled the integrated rgs spectrum of the outflow .",
    "the unfavorable dispersion direction of the existing rgs observations does not allow us to probe the outflow structure along the galaxy s minor axis .",
    "thus a deep /rgs observation with the dispersion perpendicular to the minor axis is highly desirable . with imaging spectroscopic capability of upcoming x - ray detectors ( e.g. , _ astro - h _ ) ,",
    "major advances can be made with the type of modeling illustrated here , which will lead to improved measurements of the plasma properties and unique insights into the interplay between hot and cool gases in such galaxies .",
    "finally , we also plan to carefully examine scenarios other than the cx and the thermal plasma emissions ( e.g. , recombining plasma due to fast adiabatic expansion or to a recently extinguished active galactic nucleus ) , although they were not favored in brief explorations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
