    "the standard model ( sm ) for the elementary particles interactions has been successfully tested at the level of quantum corrections .",
    "in particular high precision and collider experiments have tested the model and have placed the border line for new physics effects at energies of the order of @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand , new physics effect in the neutrino sector have recently received an important amount of experimental information coming from flavor oscillation @xcite .",
    "this fact is the first evidence of neutrino masses different from zero , and hence , of physics beyond the sm . in this way , the neutrino sector and in particular neutrino - nucleon interactions , could be the place where new physics may become manifest again .",
    "although the sm has been successful to describe the world at short distances , as a low energy effective theory of phenomena at higher scales , it leaves several open questions , e.g. : it does not predict the number of families and the fermions masses , has several free parameters , the mass generation mechanism through the higgs boson , where its mass is not predicted , is untested and still leaves open the hierarchy problem . in these conditions , it is believed that we should have some kind of physics beyond the sm , which is called new physics ( np)@xcite . the search of np proceeds mainly through the comparison of data with the sm predictions .",
    "the experimental way to look for np effects in a model independent fashion is to construct observables that can be affected by this new physics and then compare the measurements with the mentioned sm expectation .",
    "certain types of np can already be present at the tev scale and could participate in neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "hence , these np effects could possibly become apparent in neutrino telescopes .",
    "this detectors are able to explore the high energy neutrino - nucleon collision , reaching centre - of - mass energies orders of magnitude above those of man made accelerators . although having large uncertainties on the beam composition and fluxes , cosmic ray experiments present a unique opportunity to look for new physics at scales far beyond the tev when energetic cosmic and atmospheric neutrinos interact with the nucleons of the earth . in this sense",
    "an observable recently defined , which is weakly dependent of the initial flux @xcite , was used to bound physics beyond the standard model @xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in to study the effects originated in leptoquark physics on this observable and other related .",
    "in particular we use the angular observable @xmath0 ( and the related observable @xmath2 ) to bound leptoquarks effects .",
    "our results are comparable with the one obtained by using the inelasticity as observable @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we use the neutrinos flux arriving to the detector after through the earth , for the all energy range .",
    "thus , the earth stop the atmospheric muons , vanishing the corresponding background .",
    "up - going muon events from cc @xmath3 interactions produce an energetic muon traversing the detector .",
    "the selection of these events eliminate the background of atmospheric muons .",
    "this is the traditional observation mode .",
    "simulations , baked by amanda data , indicate that the direction of muons can be determined with sub degree accuracy and their energy measured to better than @xmath4 in the logarithm of the energy .",
    "the important advantage of this mode is the angular sub - degree resolution which is a fundamental fact for the definition of the observable @xmath0 . in the other hand ,",
    "as it was recognized by the authors of ref.@xcite , if we take as detection volume for contained events the instrumented volume ( for icecube roughly 1km@xmath5 ) icecube we will have sufficient energy resolution to separately assign the energy fractions in the muon track and the hadronic shower allowing the determination of the inelasticity distribution and the neutrino energy .",
    "recently the possibility to measure the inelasticity distribution was used to study the possibility to put bounds to new effects coming from leptoquarks or black - hole production over kinematics regions ever tested @xcite . in our particular case",
    "the possibility of measured independently the muon energy and the hadronic shower energy will allow us a reasonable @xmath3-energy determination . in the following",
    "we take the uncertainties in the @xmath3-energy as @xmath6 .",
    "how we will explain below in this work we use the guaranteed atmospheric muon neutrino flux added to a isotropic cosmic neutrino flux , lower than the amanda bound but higher than the waxman - bachall level .    the existence of families of quarks and leptons suggest a possible link between these two sectors @xcite .",
    "many theories , like composite models , technicolor , and grand unified theories , predict the existence of new particles , called leptoquarks , that mediate quark - lepton transitions @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that simultaneous trilinear coupling of the leptoquark to a purely hadronic channel is excluded in order to avoid too fast barion decay @xcite . in this work , in order to illustrate the behavior of our observable , @xmath0 , with this kind of new physics we have considered the simple case of @xmath7-singlet scalar leptoquark @xmath8 coupled to the second family , which interact with quarks and leptons through the lagrangian @xmath9     diagrams contributing to the neutrino - nucleon cross section.,width=384 ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the quarks and leptons @xmath7 left - handed doublets , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the right singlets , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 the corresponding coupling constant .",
    "we are interested in the second family since the directions of the produced muons can be determined with high accuracy .    in figure",
    "[ fig : diag ] we show beside the sm contribution for charged and neutral current the leptoquark relevant diagram , where the corresponding cross section for charged and neutral current are given by :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the leptoquark width is @xmath19 . on the other hand the corresponding sm cross section reads for charged current    @xmath20 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and for the neutral current    @xmath21 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where the quark combinations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a isoscalar target are given in @xcite and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtot ] we show the behavior of the total cross section ( @xmath32 ) with the neutrino energy for different values of @xmath33 and the couplings @xmath34 .",
    "we can appreciate a disagreement with the sm predictions , due to the leptoquark contribution for values of @xmath35 where the leptoquark can be on shell .",
    "the surviving flux of neutrinos of energy @xmath36 , with inclination @xmath37 with respect to nadir direction , @xmath38 , is the solution of the complete transport equation @xcite : @xmath39 where the first term correspond to absorption effects and the second one to the regeneration . here ,",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of nucleons per unit area in the neutrino path through the earth ,    @xmath42    @xmath43 is the avogradro number , @xmath44 is the radius of the earth , @xmath37 is the nadir angle taken from the down - going normal to the neutrino telescope and the earth density @xmath45 is given by the preliminary reference earth model @xcite . in order to find a solution for this equation we make the following approximation @xcite : we replace the fluxes ratio inside the integral of the second member by the ratio of fluxes that solve the homogeneous equation ( i.e. , only considering absorption effects ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 is the initial flux at the earth surface .",
    "how we explain later , we will use the initial flow given by the sum of the atmospheric flux , with a well - known angular dependency , with a diffuse and isotropic cosmic flux .",
    "thus , integrating the transport equation we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51    it is important to mention that the solution of the transport equation , eq .",
    "( [ transporte ] ) is the first , but quite accurate , approximation of the iterative method showed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a kilometer cubic neutrino telescope as icecube is capable of probing fundamental questions of ultra - high energy neutrino interactions .",
    "disagreement with the standard model prediction for the cross section could be an indication of new physics .",
    "the problem is that the knowledge of neutrino flux and neutrino - nucleon cross section must be built up simultaneously , since we are largely ignorant of both in the energy regime of interest .",
    "the knowledge of one is dependent on knowledge of the other . in these conditions",
    "we have defined in a previous work @xcite an observable ( @xmath0 ) to search effects of new physic in the neutrino - nucleon interaction .",
    "this new observable works by comparing the surviving flux at the detector such that the observable is weakly dependent of the initial flux .    the angle @xmath0 and the related ratio @xmath2 introduced in ref.@xcite are the observable that we shall use in this paper in order to study the impact of leptoquark physics on neutrino detection in a neutrino telescope such as icecube .",
    "by definition @xmath0 is the angle that divides the earth into two homo - event sectors .",
    "when neutrinos traverse the planet in their journey to the detector , they find different matter densities , and then , different number of nucleons to interact with . in this conditions ,",
    "the number of neutrinos that finally arrive to the detector depends on the arrival directions , indicated by the angle @xmath37 with respect to the nadir direction .",
    "if we consider only upward - going neutrinos of a given energy @xmath36 , that is , the ones with arrival directions @xmath37 such that @xmath52 , there will always exist an angle @xmath0 such that the number of events for @xmath53 equals that for @xmath54 .    clearly , the value of @xmath0 is energy dependent . for low energies , the cross section decreases and the earth becomes transparent to neutrinos . in this case @xmath55 for a diffuse isotropic flux since this angle divides the hemisphere into two sectors with the same solid angle . obviously for extremely high energies , where most neutrinos are absorbed , @xmath56 , and for intermediate energies @xmath0 varies accordingly between these limiting behaviors .",
    "in order to define @xmath0 we consider the expected number of events ( muon tracks though charged currents @xmath57 interactions ) at icecube in the energy interval @xmath58 and in the angular interval @xmath59 that can be estimated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of target nucleons in the effective detection volume , @xmath62 is the running time , and @xmath63 is the charged neutrino - nucleon cross section .",
    "we take the detection volume for the events equal to the instrumented volume for icecube , which is roughly 1 km@xmath5 and corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath38 in eq.([numberevent ] ) is the survival flux which is the solution ( eq.([transporte ] ) ) of the complete transport equation @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 is essentially the equality between two number of events , thus , to a good approximation , for each energy bin all the previous factors cancel except the integrated fluxes at each side . in this way",
    ", @xmath0 can be defined by the equation @xmath65 which is numerically solved to give the results shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : alfainthelq](solid line ) .",
    "there we show the sm prediction for @xmath0 , the theoretical uncertainties as we explain below and the leptoquarks contribution for different values of the mass @xmath33 and for the coupling @xmath66 .    the main characteristics of @xmath0 have been reported recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth to notice that @xmath0 is weakly dependent on the initial flux but , at the same time it is strongly dependent on the neutrino nucleon cross - section . hence , the use of the observable @xmath0 reduces the effects of the experimental systematics and initial flux dependence .",
    "since the functional form of @xmath0 sharply depends on the interaction cross section neutrino - nucleon , if physics beyond the sm operates at these high energies it will become manifest directly onto the function @xmath0 .    in order to evaluate the impact of the observable @xmath0 to bound new physics effects , we have estimated the corresponding uncertainties on the sm prediction for @xmath0 .",
    "considering the number of events as distributed according to a poisson distribution the uncertainty can be propagated onto the angle @xmath67 .",
    "the number of events @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 is @xmath70 where we have considered the effective volume for contained events so that an accurate and simultaneous determination of the muon energy and shower energy is possible and then of the neutrino energy .",
    "for icecube , it corresponds to the instrumented volume , roughly 1 km@xmath5 , implying a number of target nucleons @xmath71 .",
    "we have considered an integration time @xmath72 yr which is the expected lifetime of the experiment . to propagate the error on @xmath68 to obtain the one on @xmath73",

    "we have added together the cosmological diffuse isotropic flux and the atmospheric one(see fig .  [",
    "fig : flux0 ] ) . for the atmospheric flux",
    ", we have considered the one given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the cosmological diffuse flux , the usual benchmark is the so - called waxman - bahcall ( wb ) flux for each flavor , @xmath78 , which is derived assuming that neutrinos come from transparent cosmic ray sources @xcite , and that there is an adequate transfer of energy to pions following @xmath79 collisions .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that if there are in fact hidden sources which are opaque to ultra - high energy cosmic rays , then the expected neutrino flux will be higher .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the experimental bounds set by amanda .",
    "a summary of these bounds can be found in refs.@xcite and as a representative value we take @xmath80 . with the intention to estimate the number of events , we have considered an intermediate flux ( int ) level slightly below the present experimental bound by amanda , @xmath81",
    "moreover we have considered the theoretical uncertainties on the observable @xmath82 , which come from the uncertainties in the earth density , the standard model neutrino - nucleon cross section and the initial neutrino flux . as we explained above , we have considered the initial flux as the sum between the atmospheric flux and an isotropic diffuse cosmic flux .",
    "the observable @xmath0 is weakly dependent on the isotropic uncertainties in the cosmic flux , but it is dependent on the anisotropic uncertainties in the atmospheric flux .",
    "uncertainties in the calculated neutrino intensity arise from lack precise knowledge of the input quantities , which are the primary spectrum and the inclusive cross section for production of pions and kaons by hadronic interaction in the atmosphere .",
    "if we consider the primary spectrum as isotropic then , the corresponding uncertainties do not affect significatively to @xmath0 . any isotropic overall factor that we include to modify the initial atmospheric flux",
    "do not produce higher effects on @xmath0 because it is defined by comparing the number of events from different angular directions . in this conditions",
    "the principal source of uncertainties is the inclusive cross section for production of pions and kaons .",
    "we include theoretical uncertainties in the energy - angular dependence in the atmospheric flux due to the uncertainties in the @xmath83 ratio as an angular uncertainty between horizontal and vertical neutrino events . in order to take into account these uncertainties and their effect on @xmath0",
    "we have multiplied the atmospheric initial flux by an angular dependent factor , imposing opposite uncertainties of @xmath8410% to horizontal and vertical flux respectively and interpolating for intermediate angular values . in a similar way we have taken into account the uncertainties that come from the earth density and the neutrino - nucleon cross section @xcite , such that it maximize the uncertainties on @xmath0 .",

    "the interval for maximum sensitivity for @xmath73 is @xmath85 .",
