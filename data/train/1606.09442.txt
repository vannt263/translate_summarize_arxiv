    "there has been continual interest in the double slit experiment for over two centuries , from its original incarnation for light@xcite to its reincarnation after the advent of quantum mechanics.@xcite more generally , interference in quantum systems continues to be an active area of research , as experimentalists endeavor to coax ever larger objects to interfere,@xcite to see interference in ion - trap and cold atom systems,@xcite and to understand interference in exotic situations such as bose - einstein condensates@xcite or with topological defects.@xcite    the double - slit experiment is the paradigmatic example of quantum mechanical `` weirdness . ''",
    "according to feynman , it contains `` the only mystery [ of quantum mechanics ] '' where the particles  whatever they may be , electrons , photons , etc.behave `` sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a wave.''@xcite in the conceptually simplest set - up , a stream of particles is incident on a barrier in which two slits have been made to allow passage . on the far side of the barrier is a detection screen , which is ultimately examined to determine the outcome of the experiment . as is well known , the detection screen will reveal an interference pattern if no attempt  by an observer or otherwise , e.g. , the environment  was made to determine which path was taken by the particles , even when the particles are sufficiently separated in time that only one is ever in the region containing the barrier and the screen .",
    "the interference pattern disappears if a detection apparatus is placed to determine which path is taken by each particle .",
    "in other words , acquiring a particle s `` which - path '' information prevents it from exhibiting interference . a schematic",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "if however , one is willing to forgo _ perfect _ determination of the path , partial interference can be preserved .",
    "this relationship has previously been demonstrated in theoretical analyses and proposed experimental realizations of the double - slit experiment for light,@xcite and a general treatment of imperfect two - state discrimination from basic quantum mechanical principles can be found in textbooks.@xcite in short , when the apparatus / observer acquires information about the system the interference pattern disappears .",
    "emerge from the two slits separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "( a ) when no measurement is made and coherence is otherwise preserved , the probability density @xmath1 shows that as time progresses the two packets begin to interfere , ultimately resulting in a well - defined interference pattern .",
    "( b ) in the case of a perfect measurement , each particle takes either the left or the right path . in this case",
    "@xmath1 observed at the detection screen will be an incoherent sum of the two spreading gaussian wavepackets , i.e. , no interference will be present . ]    this deep relationship between interference and information can be understood in the context of decoherence and entanglement , and plays a significant role in understanding the quantum - to - classical transition.@xcite while there exist a multitude of papers@xcite and books@xcite on the more general subjects of quantum information and decoherence , the explicit application of these ideas to specific physical systems at a level suitable for students is lacking . to that end",
    ", we examine a model of double - slit interference in the presence of measurement . the model allows the measurement precision to be tuned , and thus to examine the interplay between path information gained and the loss of interference : when one distinguishes between a particle at the left and right slits , then the interference is destroyed ; when no information is gained , then interference is manifest .",
    "this is done in an example that is approachable by senior undergraduate and first year graduate students , and thus should help make the core concepts of interference , measurement , distinguishability , decoherence , and dephasing more concrete in the classroom .    in order to keep the discussion concise , we assume that the reader is familiar with certain mathematical and conceptual tools not necessarily presented in introductory courses , the foremost of which are density operators,@xcite the evaluation of gaussian integrals,@xcite and the partial trace.@xcite we also provide only a brief introduction to quantum entropy and mutual information.@xcite students who have not had prior exposure to these concepts may require a brief overview before pursuing a detailed understanding of the model .",
    "it is also convenient to work with dimensionless parameters , but we wish to retain the traditional symbols for readability . to that end",
    ", we fix a length scale @xmath2 ( the slit width ) and denote physical quantities that carry a dimension with an overbar .",
    "the unbarred version is then the natural dimensionless parameter determined by @xmath2 and physical constants .",
    "hence we have dimensionless position @xmath3 , time @xmath4 , momentum @xmath5 , and so on .",
    "similarly , we use a dimensionless hamiltonian , @xmath6 , momentum operator , @xmath7 , and position operator , @xmath8 .",
    "we first consider the case where no measurement is attempted . the prototypical version of the double slit experiment is to have particles impinge on a barrier one by one .",
    "the barrier has two slits that let particles through , where they then continue to travel until striking the detection screen .",
    "the latter will reveal the interference pattern  or lack thereof  that emerges after many repetitions of the experiment .",
    "we will consider a simplified version of this scenario where , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , there is just one spatial dimension and the evolution starts after the single particle exits the double slit .    when the particle  the system @xmath9exits the slits in a superposition of two gaussian states,@xcite i.e. , its state @xmath10 is given by the wavefunction @xmath11,\\ ] ] the two gaussian components will begin to spread . here , as throughout",

    "the one in which the source , barrier , and screen are separated .",
    "as time moves on , one can imagine the particle moving from the barrier to the detection screen .",
    "more formally , one could include the additional spatial dimensions and integrate them out , as they do not play an important role .",
    "making use of the free - particle hamiltonian @xmath15 , we find the time - evolved state by integrating @xmath16 using the initial wavefunction and evaluating the resulting gaussian integral , one finds that the time - dependent wavefunction is given by @xmath17}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\    & \\left.+ \\exp{\\left[-\\frac{\\left(x - l\\right)^2}{2(1 + { i } t)}\\right]}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the associated probability density is then @xmath18,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath19 has been introduced for readability . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freefly ] ) , the one with the hyperbolic cosine , is just a sum of two gaussian wavepackets , which represent particles coming from the left or right slit , respectively .",
    "the second term , the one with the cosine , describes the interference between these two sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : twoslits ] shows the probability density , eq .",
    "( [ eq : freefly ] ) , for various times  i.e . , the separation between the slits and detection screen  for a slit spacing @xmath20 .     at different times after passing through two slits .",
    "note that this corresponds to the time of flight from the slit to the detection screen .",
    "( a ) initially , the two packets are well separated .",
    "( b ) as they spread , they will start to interfere .",
    "( c ) eventually , a well - defined interference pattern develops , which ( d ) begins to spread out . ]",
    "we now want to consider how measurement affects the appearance of interference .",
    "specifically , we are interested in how the interference pattern is lost as the amount of information gained increases . in an introductory quantum course , one would discuss , for example , double - slit interference of electrons and measurement via photons . in this case , the observation is performed by measuring scattered light , which , with a suitably short wavelength , distinguishes the position of the electron . as the wavelength is increased ,",
    "the scattered light no longer is imprinted with the left / right position of the electron . calculating this scattering process",
    ", however , requires a large amount of background material , unsuitable for introductory courses .",
    "instead , we consider an idealized measurement process that nevertheless admits variable precision ranging continuously from perfect measurement to no measurement at all .",
    "following the idea of a von neumann chain,@xcite this process will make use of an auxiliary quantum system , the apparatus @xmath21 .",
    "when the apparatus , in an appropriately initialized state @xmath22 , interacts with a particle in the state @xmath23 with wavefunction @xmath24 that is completely localized around the left slit ( where we use the less strict condition , @xmath25 for @xmath26 ) , a perfect measurement would bring the composite state @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , when the apparatus interacts with a particle in a state @xmath29 with a wavefunction @xmath30 that is completely localized around the right slit , a perfect measurement would bring the state @xmath31 to @xmath32 . this process transfers information about the particle s state into @xmath21 , encoding the outcome of the left / right - measurement in a subspace of dimension two spanned by the basis states @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this left / right information is accessible to observers who can `` read '' the apparatus state .",
    "if one has a limited resolution measurement , or wavefunctions @xmath24 and @xmath30 that have overlap , then this information transfer can not be perfect .      in general",
    ", after a measuring apparatus @xmath21 interacts with a system @xmath9 , observers can infer the state of the system by interacting with ( and amplifying information from ) the apparatus through the standard measurement process ; i.e. , by measuring a non - degenerate observable of @xmath21 corresponding to the possible measurement outcomes .",
    "of course , such a subsequent measurement could be treated similarly , requiring yet another measuring apparatus , and so on , leading one ultimately to the von neumann chain .",
    "we are here concerned only with the first step in such a chain , considering only the interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath21 .",
    "later on , we briefly discuss the observer as an additional link in the von neumann chain .    in our case ,",
    "the relevant ( non - degenerate ) eigenstates of @xmath21 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the apparatus and system interact immediately after the particle passes through the slit , so that the particle wavefunction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wave ] ) , does not have time to evolve on its own before the measurement is made . as usual , the interaction between the apparatus and the system results in a unitary transformation of the joint state .",
    "specifically , in keeping with the above discussion , we require that during the measurement process the joint state , initially @xmath35 , evolves as @xmath36 during the interaction ( here , as elsewhere , we use @xmath37 for our specific system state in distinction to the @xmath38 used for generic system states in the introduction to sec .  [",
    "ssec : mmm ] ) .",
    "when the apparatus registers `` @xmath13 '' , the system will be in a state @xmath39 that is localized to a precision @xmath40around the left slit due to the act of measurement itself .",
    "the conditional state @xmath41 depends on both the initial system state and the measurement operator ( similarly for @xmath42 ) .",
    "the initial state and the states @xmath43 and @xmath44 resulting from such an interaction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfunc ] ( a ) using an explicit form of the measurement operator to be derived later in eq .",
    "( [ eq : measuredensity ] ) . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarymeasure ] ) can not , in general , be written as a simple product of system and apparatus states .",
    "thus , the interaction has caused the two to become _ entangled _ ( except , of course , in the limiting case of no discrimination ) .     with peaks at @xmath45 and the conditional states of the post - measurement wavefunction with @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( dashed ) and @xmath48 ( solid ) .",
    "( b ) the measurement functions squared , @xmath49 ( dashed ) and @xmath50 ( solid ) , versus position .",
    "as @xmath40 increases and the measurement becomes less precise , they tend toward a common constant value ; in the opposite limit , they become complementary step - functions . ]    the operators @xmath51 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarymeasure ] ) are called `` measurement operators '' and are written inside the ket in order to make clear the fact that they act only on the system @xmath9 . as noted , these operators determine the state of the particle after the measurement . since the left / right measurement distinguishes the position of the particle , it suffices to take @xmath51 diagonal in the position basis , giving rise to a pair of `` measurement functions '' @xmath52 with this choice , the action of @xmath51 on the system wavefunction is purely multiplicative , @xmath53 .",
    "since the apparatus states @xmath33 and @xmath34 are orthogonal , the requirement that eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarymeasure ] ) constitutes a _ unitary _ transformation will be satisfied whenever @xmath54 which , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfuncdef ] ) , is equivalent to @xmath55 equation ( [ eq : unitarymeasure ] ) can then be extended to a unitary transformation defined on the whole joint hilbert space .",
    "we note that , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarymeasure ] ) does not uniquely determine this unitary transformation on the whole space , it suffices as a description of the interaction when the apparatus is initialized to @xmath22 .    while the composite state evolves unitarily , we are also interested in the states of the system and apparatus separately . in particular , we are interested in whether the system state exhibits interference and how the apparatus state encodes information about the system . for this reason we will examine the density operator @xmath56[0pt]{\\ensuremath{\\scriptscriptstyle \\s\\a}}\\middle\\langle\\phi\\right\\vert}$ ] and the reduced states of the system and apparatus .",

    "note that the degree of overlap between the states @xmath58 and @xmath59 depends on the measurement precision ; they are orthogonal when the measurement perfectly distinguishes left from right ( @xmath60 ) but identical in the opposite limit of @xmath61 ( in which case @xmath62 and no actual measurement is made ) .",
    "hence , except in this latter case , the system transitions from a coherent superposition or pure state ( i.e. , one representable by a ket ) to a mixed state ( one which can not be represented by a ket ) : it has been _ decohered_,@xcite to an extent that depends on the measurement precision , through its interaction with the apparatus .    the partial trace over the system can be evaluated in the position basis with the help of eq . ( [ eq : mfuncdef ] ) , leading to the apparatus state @xmath63 when represented in the @xmath64 subspace .",
    "further evaluation requires a definite choice of @xmath65 .",
    "while there are many possibilities , a physically meaningful choice can be made by considering first a continuous position measurement,@xcite out of which we can build a coarse - grained , binary measurement . to that end , consider the position - indexed , commuting set of operators @xmath66 , defined by @xmath67 which represent a smooth analog of the projection operator @xmath68[0pt]{\\ensuremath{\\scriptscriptstyle { } } } \\middle\\langlex'\\right\\vert}$ ] ( to which @xmath66 tends as @xmath69 ) .    by integrating separately over the positive and negative domains of @xmath70",

    "( [ eq : measure_complete ] ) and ( [ eq : mfuncs ] ) , we see that taking @xmath73^{1/2}\\ ] ] yields measurement operators satisfying @xmath74 .",
    "one can check directly that the pair of operators @xmath75 satisfy @xmath76 , so we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ eq : measuredensity ] ) provides a physically meaningful function that satisfies our criteria .",
    "figure [ fig : mfunc ] shows how the function @xmath77 changes as one varies @xmath40 .",
    "returning to eq .",
    "( [ eq : postapp ] ) and inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : measuredensity ] ) , one finds that the diagonal terms evaluate to gaussian integrals , which can be computed exactly .",
    "the off - diagonal terms contain the product @xmath78 , which does not result in a simple closed - form expression ( although it is easily evaluated numerically for specific values of @xmath40 ) . in order to obtain an analytic expression for arbitrary @xmath40",
    ", some approximation will be necessary . to that end ,",
    "recall that @xmath37 is a superposition of two gaussians centered at @xmath13 and @xmath79 , respectively . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the value of @xmath81 changes little over the regions in which @xmath37 is non - negligible .",
    "this can be seen qualitatively by considering the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfunc ] or analytically by expanding @xmath81 in a taylor series about @xmath82 .",

    "the maximizing the derivative with respect to @xmath40 shows that , for fixed @xmath13 , @xmath89 hence , the linear coefficient here is certainly smaller than @xmath90 for all @xmath40 , i.e. , over the width of the gaussian ( @xmath91 in the dimensionless units employed here ) . the first - order change to @xmath92 near",
    "@xmath13 is at most @xmath90 ( this is a worst case estimate , and for @xmath93 gives a bound of @xmath94 ) .",
    "higher order terms are likewise suppressed .",
    "similarly , the first - order term near @xmath95 is bounded by @xmath96.@xcite we therefore consider @xmath97 and @xmath98 ; i.e. , the functions @xmath92 are approximated , but not the gaussian envelopes . this results in the approximations @xmath99\\nonumber\\\\    & \\approx b[m_\\sigma(l){e}^{-(x + l)^2/2 } + m_\\sigma(-l){e}^{-(x - l)^2/2}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath100\\nonumber\\\\    & \\approx b[m_\\sigma(-l){e}^{-(x + l)^2/2 } + m_\\sigma(l){e}^{-(x - l)^2/2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in both @xmath101 and @xmath102 , each term in the superposition is approximated separately .",

    "returning again to eq .",
    "( [ eq : postapp ] ) , it is clear that the approximation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : approxfuncl ] ) and ( [ eq : approxfuncr ] ) , does not affect the diagonal terms .",
    "it does , however , allow us to evaluate the off - diagonal terms as intended , which are now also just gaussian integrals .",
    "doing so , we find @xmath109 this has trace @xmath91 , as expected , and the eigenvalues are @xmath110 as in eq .",

    "it is well known that the act of measuring exactly which path a particle takes in passing through the slits prevents the appearance of interference effects .",
    "having determined the immediate effect of measurement on the particle s state , we must now evaluate the subsequent evolution in order to determine how the interference is affected .",

    "we have called the interaction determined in eq .

    "this interaction is just a particular example of a positive - operator valued measure ( povm).@xcite the key idea is that the apparatus acquires information about the state of the system due to this interaction . to make this statement quantitative , we make use of two key ideas from the theory of quantum information : entropy and mutual information .    for any state represented by a density operator @xmath137 with eigenvalues @xmath138 , the von neumann entropy is defined by @xmath139 } = -\\sum_i { \\lambda_i \\log_2{\\lambda_i}},\\ ] ] in which we take @xmath140 whenever it arises .",

    "as described previously , we have @xmath149 since the joint - state is pure ( having evolved unitarily from a pure product state ) .",

    "this measurement - induced decoherence of the system is associated with information acquisition by the measurement apparatus , which is reflected in this generation of entropy .",
    "that is , the system goes from a pure state initially , with entropy of zero , to a mixed state with nonzero entropy .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ eq : infodeco ] ) , we see that determining the mutual information between the system and the apparatus amounts to finding the entropy for the reduced state of either the system or the apparatus . in a general measurement scheme ,",
    "these may depend on time , but when the system and apparatus states undergo _ independent _ unitary evolution after the measurement process , we need only consider the states immediately after the measurement.@xcite in our case , for example , the particles passing through the slits evolve as free particles after the interaction , while the apparatus state remains unchanged .",
    "hence , we may compute the mutual information from the state of the apparatus immediately after the measurement , without involving the more complicated time - dependent state of the particle .",

    "@xmath166,@xcite the apparatus rapidly loses the ability to distinguish between the two paths , and interference begins to emerge .    considering the above discussion",
    ", one notes that the _ quantum _ mutual information indicates that , in the case of perfect measurement , we get _ two _ bits of information , despite the fact that the information in which we are interested appears to be a simple binary statement regarding the particle s path , or one bit .",
    "this is a peculiarity of quantum information , corresponding to the existence of non - classical correlations ( entanglement ) between the apparatus and the system . if there is a third link in the von neumann chain  e.g .",
    ", an observer making measurements on _ the apparatus_we will find that there is only one bit of information between the system and apparatus or between the system and observer . indeed , that there are many links in the von neumann chain , including not just the apparatus and observer , but also the large surrounding environment , e.g. , photons , is why quantum correlations are so hard to detect.@xcite the presence of many such links is reflected in the redundant acquisition of information by the environment , which is the quantum darwinian process responsible for the emergence of the classical , objective world.@xcite . to see this , consider an observer @xmath167 that perfectly measures the apparatus immediately after the particle has been measured .",
    "in other words , if the observer is initially in the state @xmath168 , the observer and the apparatus evolve according to @xmath169 then we should replace eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarymeasure ] ) with @xmath170 where for a perfect measurement the system states @xmath41 and @xmath171 would be orthogonal .    if we now compute the partial trace over the apparatus as done in eq .",

    "( [ eq : poststate ] ) , showing that the entropy of the particle is unaffected by the observer s measurement of the apparatus .",
    "the entropy of the observer , though , is @xmath173 .",
    "in contrast to the previous discussion , the joint state @xmath174 is not pure , so its entropy does not vanish .",
    "rather , the orthogonality of @xmath175 and @xmath176 , due to the presence of the left / right record in the observer s state , indicate that this , too , has @xmath177 .",
    "hence , the mutual information is @xmath178 indicating that the observer acquires an amount of information equal to what is available about the path of the particle , @xmath179 .",
    "if path information is present , or the measurement precision is @xmath180 yielding @xmath181 , then the observer will acquire 1 bit of information .",
    "if not , @xmath182 , the observer will learn nothing about the path of the particle and interference will be observed at the screen . when the observer is present and the global state is eq .",
    "( [ eq : globalstate ] ) , the apparatus will also have mutual information given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : miwo ] ) , as entanglement with @xmath9 is `` locked up '' in joint correlations between @xmath9 and @xmath183 .    finally , we note that in the large @xmath13 approximation , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : appeigens ] ) and ( [ eq : visbeta ] ) together allow us to write @xmath184 this explicitly connects the information gain by the observer with the loss of visibility of the interference fringes through the binary entropy @xmath185 which characterizes the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a classical event that could result in one of two outcomes with probabilities @xmath12 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "when the fringes are readily apparent @xmath187 and the information acquired by the observer ( or apparatus ) is @xmath188 . on the other extreme , when the fringes are not visible @xmath189 and the information gain is @xmath190 .",
    "note also that in the intermediate regimes one can have quite high visibilities even for @xmath191 near @xmath91 , but for @xmath192 there are still visible interference fringes despite gaining nearly complete information about the system s path .",
    "this fact was also noted in the case of interference of photons.@xcite",
    "by considering a specific model of double - slit interference , we have shown how the precision with which one determines the path of particles passing through the slit is directly correlated with the loss of observed interference effects in the subsequent evolution of the particles . in particular , we have shown how the absence of interference can be attributed to an apparatus gaining maximal information gaining maximal information , while a measurement that acquires no information about the system has no effect on the interference ( note that the apparatus may be a physical device , an observer , or the environment ) .",
    "it bears mentioning that while we have focused exclusively on how the act of measurement can cause a loss of interference , this is by no means the only reason interference may not be observed .",
    "another cause for interference loss is _ dephasing _ , which occurs when , for example , the relative phase between the two gaussians in the superposition varies from trial to trial . in this case , the absence of interference is a statistical result arising from the oscillation term acquiring a different phase in each trial , which causes the probability density to be shifted . if the phase is gaussian distributed with a width @xmath193 ( and mean 0 ) , then the expected probability density for a free particle ( @xmath194 ) becomes @xmath195,\\ ] ] when @xmath80 ( this calculation is similar to that in sect .  [ sec : free_interference ] ) .",
    "hence , a sharply - peaked distribution of phases will exhibit interference that becomes washed out as the distribution widens . while this `` dephasing '' process produces a similar experimental outcome ( namely , the loss of interference ) , it is important to note that the physical process is quite different than that of measurement - induced decoherence.@xcite in particular , decoherence removes interference from the wavefunction for every trial , whereas the loss of interference due to dephasing is found only as a result of averaging over many different trials .",
    "the model we have examined serves as a concrete example of the relationship between information and interference in quantum systems .",
    "it is approachable by students in the latter portion of introductory courses ( such as the second or third course in a year - long sequence ) , including those at the upper - undergraduate level in many programs .",
    "it can serve as a basis for homework problems and projects by considering , for example , small @xmath13 rather than large @xmath13 approximations , different amplitudes in the initial superposition , more general measurement schemes , application of numerical and approximation techniques , or a double - well preparation of the initial state ( e.g. , using two delta function potentials ) , among other things .",
    "it will thus provide a link between the usual conceptual discussion surrounding the double slit experiment and actual calculations , as well as bring a modern account of measurement into the classroom .",
    "the exact wavefunction emerging from the slits in an experimental set - up will be complicated , depending on the exact slit shape geometry , the incoming state , particle type , etc .",
    "a superposition of gaussian wavepackets , which we consider , leads to a clean presentation of interference and measurement .",
    "a square wavepacket , for @xmath196 , with @xmath197 the heaviside step - function at each slit , which matches the ideal geometry of the slit , is also tractable , and can give a suitable extension of this work for class projects .",
    "the actual wavefunction , however , will be more complicated .",
    "indeed , a reasonable approximate form is @xmath198\\right)}$ ] ( and zero for @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) at each slit of width @xmath2 .",
    "this function , while only approximate , is already non - analytic , but can both match the geometry and have smooth boundaries .",
    "recall that the partial trace is defined by @xmath201 where @xmath202 is any basis for the apparatus hilbert space , resulting in an operator that acts only on the system .",
    "for example , one has @xmath203[0pt]{\\ensuremath{\\scriptscriptstyle \\s\\a}}\\middle\\langle{{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{m}}}_{\\sigma}}^r\\psi , r\\right\\vert}\\right ) } = 0,\\ ] ] as the left hand side is equal to @xmath204[0pt]{\\ensuremath{\\scriptscriptstyle \\s}}\\middle\\langle\\psi\\right\\vert}{{{{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{m}}}_{\\sigma}}^r}^\\dagger}\\operatorname{tr}{\\left({\\left\\vertl\\middle\\rangle\\raisebox{-0.25em}[0pt][0pt]{\\ensuremath{\\scriptscriptstyle \\a}}\\middle\\langler\\right\\vert}\\right)}$ ] .",
    "note that the states and in eq .",
    "( [ eq : poststate ] ) do not constitute a complete basis for our apparatus state , but they do give the only nonzero terms in the trace here .        the first - order approximation about @xmath95",
    "is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear_m ] ) with the replacement @xmath205 .",
    "the linear coefficient can easily be seen to be bounded graphically , but in this case the denominator includes a factor of @xmath206 , which can not be bounded below by a positive constant .",
    "a numerical calculation provides a bound of approximately @xmath207 on the actual coefficient , and there are many functions that can be used to find bounds analytically .",
    "for example , inserting the bound @xmath208 into the linear coefficient and maximizing yields a bound slightly lower than the @xmath96 used in the main text .",
    "the estimate for @xmath209 is found by observing that small values of @xmath40 correspond to large values in the argument of @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the small-@xmath40 case can be analyzed using an asymptotic expansion , leading to @xmath210 further expanding this expression as a taylor series about @xmath211 and locating the @xmath12-intercept then gives @xmath212 = 0,\\ ] ] so we find @xmath213 which is the value stated in the main text ."
