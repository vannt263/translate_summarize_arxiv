    "see figure  [ figredfringes ] for illustrations of both of these situations .",
    "these two observations provide two independent constraints on the set of red vertices with which the non - root vertices of a blue subtree may be interleaved , the first determined by the structure of the red tree and the second by the pre - interleaving .",
    "this set consists of those vertices of the red forest situated to the right of both @xmath94 and @xmath97 .",
    "these red vertices induce a subgraph of the red forest which we will call its _",

    "the key fact that motivates",
    "the rest of our analysis is that vertices of a blue subtree may only be interleaved with vertices of its red fringe .",
    "the size of a red fringe depends on both the size of the corresponding red forest and also on the location of the next blue root to the left .",

    "this is the focus of the next section .",
    "to determine our lower bound , we depend critically on the fact that the asymptotic distributions of substructures of permutations in @xmath69 are _ concentrated_. in this section we introduce certain parameters counting these substructures , show how their concentration enables us to bound @xmath65 from below , and prove three of the four concentration results we require .",
    "it is frequently the case that distributions of parameters counting the proportion of particular substructures in combinatorial classes have a convergent mean and a variance that vanishes asymptotically . as a direct consequence of chebyshev s inequality ,",

    "[ propconcentration2 ] if @xmath98 and @xmath105 are two sequences of random variables on the same sample space concentrated at @xmath102 and @xmath106 respectively , then they are _ jointly concentrated _ in the sense that , for any @xmath103 , given sufficiently large  @xmath13 , @xmath107 \\:\\;>\\:\\ ; 1-\\varepsilon.\\ ] ]    for any @xmath108 and sufficiently large @xmath13 , the probability that @xmath98 differs from @xmath102 by less than @xmath109 exceeds @xmath110 , and similarly for @xmath111 with @xmath106 .",
    "hence the probability that both are simultaneously @xmath109-close to their asymptotic means is at least @xmath112 .",

    "we now introduce the parameters we need :    * blue subtrees * @xmath114 : for each plane tree @xmath93 , let @xmath115 be the random variable that records the proportion of blue subtrees in a blue tree that are isomorphic to @xmath93 .",
    "* gap sizes * @xmath116 : for each @xmath117 , let @xmath118 be the random variable that records the proportion of blue roots in a pre - interleaving that have gap size  @xmath24 .",

    "it remains for us to determine the limiting mean .",
    "similarly , differentiating   with respect to @xmath92 , setting @xmath226 , and solving the resulting equation gives @xmath228 then , extracting coefficients yields @xmath164\\+ l(z,1 ) & = & \\frac{1}{k+1 } \\binom{2k}{k } , \\\\[6pt ] [ z^k]\\+ l_u(z,1 ) & = & \\binom{2k-2m+h}{k - m-1}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] hence , applying proposition  [ propmoments ] and taking limits , @xmath158\\mathbb{e}[\\rho_k({\\text{\\small$\\mathbf{f}$}}^+ ) ] \\;=\\ ; \\frac{1}{2^{2m - h } } .\\ ] ] concentration follows from theorem  [ thmlukapatternsgaussian ] .",
    "we calculate the contribution to the growth rate from pairs consisting of a tree and a forest of bounded size . from proposition",
    "[ proplb ] , we know that , for each @xmath230 , the growth rate is at least @xmath231 where @xmath232 as follows from   and   and propositions  [ proppsi ] , [ propphi ] , [ propomega ] and  [ propomegaplus ] .",
    "the determination of this value requires the processing of more than 1.6 million pairs consisting of a tree and a forest .",
    "larger values of @xmath236 would require more sophisticated programming techniques .",
    "however , increasing @xmath236 is unlikely to lead to a significantly improved lower bound ; although the rate of convergence at @xmath237 is still quite slow , numerical analysis of the computational data suggests that @xmath238\\max\\limits_{\\lambda,\\delta}g_n(\\lambda,\\delta)$ ] is probably not far from 9.82 .",
    "we conclude with the observation that in the construction that gives our bound , the mean number of vertices in a blue subtree , @xmath64 , is less than 1.32 .",
    "we noted earlier that the cigar - shaped boundary regions of a typical @xmath1-avoider contain numerous small subtrees ( although it is not immediately obvious how one should identify such a boundary tree ) .",
    "is it the case that the mean size of these subtrees is asymptotically bounded ?",
    "perhaps , on the contrary , their average size grows unboundedly ( but very slowly ) , and understanding how ( and the rate at which ) this occurs would lead to an improved lower bound . in the meantime",
    ", the following question might be somewhat easier to answer :        the author would like to thank mireille bousquet - mlou for valuable discussions relating to this work during the cardiff workshop on combinatorial physics in december 2013 .",
    "he is also grateful to robert brignall who provided useful feedback which helped to improve the presentation ."
