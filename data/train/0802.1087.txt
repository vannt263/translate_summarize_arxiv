    "the mechanical properties of amorphous materials are important in many structural applications and the microscopic mechanisms underlying plastic deformation have been the subject of great theoretical interest  @xcite .",
    "while deformation of crystalline materials can be understood through the generation and propagation of dislocations , no analogous defect has been identified in disordered materials .",
    "this has a direct impact on their mechanical properties since dislocation motion reduces the yield stress of crystals by orders of magnitude . in the last decade",
    ", it has also been realized that amorphous materials share many features with colloids , granular media and other systems where motion is jammed or arrested by packing constraints @xcite .",
    "common features are observed in the onset of motion under external forces in such systems and understanding their behavior represents a fundamental problem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "recent simulations and experiments have followed the motion of individual atoms or particles to understand how disordered solids deform under shear @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied quantities has been the van hove function @xmath1 , which describes the probability distribution of the displacements @xmath2 of atoms as a function of time interval @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath2 is defined relative to a uniformly ( affinely ) sheared system . in equilibrium systems , @xmath4 has been used to determine the time scale on which particles escape from local cages @xcite and its long time behavior gives the diffusion constant .",
    "studies of sheared systems have examined the changes in @xmath4 to determine the effect of strain rate on caging times and diffusion@xcite .",
    "these studies have generally found @xmath5 as expected for single - particle diffusion . in some cases",
    "the associated nonequilibrium diffusion constant obeys a generalized fluctuation dissipation theorem with an effective temperature @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to examine the spatio - temporal correlations in @xmath2 in athermal systems that are driven by steady shear .",
    "this models the low temperature behavior of amorphous atomic systems as well as disordered granular or colloidal systems where thermal fluctuations are small . as in most studies of similar systems",
    "@xcite , we find that the long time evolution of @xmath6 is consistent with the diffusion equation",
    ". however , the displacement shows strong spatial correlations that span the entire system .",
    "thus @xmath7 does not describe single - particle diffusion and the diffusion constant has a strong dependence on system size @xcite .",
    "the spatial correlations in @xmath2 are associated with plastic deformation along slip lines that grow to span the system .",
    "the slip accommodated in these plastic zones is one or two molecular diameters .",
    "this sets a characteristic strain interval between their formation that decreases with system size .",
    "spatio temporal correlations in the location of the slip lines are studied through images and the evolution in the functional form of @xmath7 with strain .",
    "the long - range spatial correlations in @xmath2 reflect the fact that large regions deform elastically . to measure the local magnitude of non - affine deformations",
    ", we evaluate the vorticity in the displacement field @xmath8 .",
    "other measures of the _ relative _ particle displacement have been considered in previous work , but @xmath8 has the advantage that it allows both the magnitude and direction of the displacements to be quantified .",
    "this allows strong directional , spatial and temporal correlations in strain to be identified .",
    "the distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath8 provide additional information about correlations . over short intervals ,",
    "both distributions show exponential tails covering up to eight orders of magnitude .",
    "the strain characterizing the exponential decay for @xmath8 is close to the the macroscopic yield strain of the material .",
    "as the interval of time or strain increases , @xmath10 becomes more isotropic and converges to a gaussian at strain intervals of order 3% .",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 retains an exponential tail out to much larger strains , indicating that particles are still not undergoing single - particle diffusion .",
    "we perform classical 2d molecular dynamics simulations of a bi - disperse mixture that is chosen to inhibit crystallization  @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath11 large ( l ) particles and @xmath12 small ( s ) particles with @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction between particles of type @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a lennard jones ( lj ) potential : @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 sets the characteristic energy scale and @xmath18 reflects the size of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we set @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and measure all lengths in units of @xmath22 .",
    "to speed calculations , the potential is truncated smoothly using a fourth order polynomial that matches the lj potential and force at @xmath23 and takes both to zero at @xmath24 .",
    "all particles have mass @xmath25 and the characteristic time is @xmath26 .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using the parallel md code lammps @xcite with time step @xmath27 .",
    "the system temperature is maintained at zero by applying a locally galilean - invariant kelvin damping mechanism @xcite .",
    "neighboring particles exert equal and opposite drag forces on each other which are proportional to their relative velocity .",
    "the value of the damping constant was set to @xmath28 . with this choice ,",
    "modes with wavelengths at the particle scale are nearly critically damped and damping decreases at longer lengths .",
    "the limit of zero temperature is of fundamental interest in atomic systems and thermal motion can generally be ignored in systems where the particles represent larger entities such as grains or colloids .",
    "an amorphous state of the system is prepared following the protocol in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions with periods @xmath29 and @xmath30 are used .",
    "a random configuration with a particle area fraction of @xmath31 is equilibrated for @xmath32 time steps using a soft repulsive potential to ensure particles do not overlap .",
    "the interaction is then switched to the lj potential , and the damped system is run for @xmath33 timesteps with fixed area .",
    "the system is next allowed to expand toward a zero pressure state under an isotropic nose - hoover barostat  @xcite with a time constant of @xmath34 and a damping parameter of @xmath35 for @xmath33 timesteps . a final quench is run for @xmath33 timesteps with a fixed cell size prior to shearing .",
    "equilibrated systems are compressed along the @xmath36 direction at constant true strain rate @xmath37 and expanded along @xmath38 to maintain constant area : @xmath39 , @xmath40 . unless noted , the results below are for about @xmath41 particles with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "studies showed that this strain rate was slow enough to be in a quasistatic regime where results are rate - independent .",
    "for this reason , results will be expressed in terms of the interval of strain @xmath0 over which they were obtained , rather than in terms of time interval . for small strains",
    "the rate of plastic deformation increases with strain and may be sensitive to initial conditions  @xcite . for strains greater than 6%",
    "the behavior becomes independent of strain and initial state .",
    "data presented below are all from this steady state regime .",
    "the non - affine component @xmath44 of a particle s velocity @xmath45 is the deviation from the velocity associated with a uniform strain : @xmath46 integrating over time gives the net non - affine displacement @xmath47 over any finite strain interval .",
    "note that this is not the same as taking the difference between the final position of a particle and the position corresponding to an affine displacement .",
    "the reason is that a small non - affine displacement at the beginning of a time interval is amplified by subsequent affine flow and would have the same impact as a much larger non - affine motion at the end of the interval .",
    "a similar effect produces an extra taylor diffusion in sheared fluids  @xcite . from now on we shall refer to the non - affine displacement simply as `` displacement '' and use `` total displacement '' when the affine component is not subtracted .",
    "note that the non - affine displacement averaged over the periodic cell is zero .",
    "this follows because the equations of motion in the deforming cell @xcite conserve the sum over particles of the peculiar momentum @xmath48 and all particles have the same mass .    the results presented below show that the displacement field has long - range spatial correlations . a more local measure of deformation is provided by the spatial derivatives of @xmath49 , which are obtained in the following way",
    "a delaunnay triangulation is found for an initial reference configuration , with vertices at the center of all particles .",
    "the derivatives @xmath50 on each triangle are then calculated from the finite difference between displacement vectors at the three vertices . to make plots and evaluate probability distributions ,",
    "the derivatives are sampled on a fine , rectilinear grid with spacing @xmath51 .",
    "an important property of this piece - wise constant definition of @xmath50 is that its integral along an arbitrary path connecting any two particles gives the exact difference between the displacement vectors of the two particles .",
    "this guarantees that mean strains on large scales are equal to the spatial average of local values .    because the area is fixed and the system is densely packed , changes in density are small . as a result",
    ", we find that the local divergence of the displacement field is negligible .",
    "most of the deformation takes the form of local shear strains that are quantified by the curl of the displacement field or vorticity : @xmath52 , which represents the antisymmetric part of the derivative tensor . for two dimensional systems the curl is a vector perpendicular to the plane and thus invariant under rotations within the plane . note",
    "that it is conventional to associate the magnitude of shear with a symmetric scalar invariant , @xmath53 , the so - called deviatoric strain .",
    "such symmetric definitions of the strain are completely blind to the vorticity of the displacement which we show below to be quite important in our system . in particular we will see that the sign of @xmath8 is strongly correlated with the orientation of lines along which shear occurs . as the magnitude of the strain increases , nonlinear terms in the definition may become important .",
    "the vorticity can be generalized to a rotation tensor @xmath54 defined by the decomposition : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a symmetric tensor which describes pure axial stretching . in the limit of infinitesimal strains , @xmath8 and the rotation angle associated with @xmath54",
    "become identical . for finite strains ,",

    "the total displacement in the surrounding elastic regions is nearly constant . subtracting the affine displacement associated with a strain @xmath0 leads to a small gradient , @xmath66 , in the elastic regions of plots of the non - affine displacement . ]    in figure  [ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] , we plot projections of a typical displacement field for @xmath67 onto horizontal , vertical and diagonal directions : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "all projections show strong spatial correlations over scales comparable to the system size , but different projections highlight different features .",
    "for example , the plot for the component proportional to @xmath68 is dominated by a region of strong gradient extended roughly along @xmath69 while the @xmath70 component has a few smaller features extended along @xmath71 and centered roughly about the large feature in @xmath72 .",
    "the displacements @xmath57 and @xmath58 show a superposition of all these features .",
    "note that some of the features extend around the periodic boundary conditions .    the strong spatial correlations evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] show that most of the displacements of atoms that contribute to @xmath73 are very far from independent random walks by each particle .",
    "the correlations result from shear along spatially extended slip lines .",
    "the slip lines show up as lines of rapid gradients in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] .",
    "because they reflect a shear displacement , the amplitude of the displacements is largest for the projection along the slip line .",
    "thus the slip line that spans the entire system along @xmath74 shows up most clearly in @xmath75 , while a number of smaller slip lines along @xmath76 are emphasized in @xmath77 .",
    "the reason that slip lines are at an angle of roughly 45@xmath78 from the compressive axis is that the stress tensor has the largest shear ( off - diagonal ) components for these orientations .",
    "to the compressive axis even when the cell has deformed significantly . ] put another way , shear along these lines is most efficient in simultaneously contracting the system along the compressive direction and expanding it in the tensile direction .",
    "figure [ fig : slipcartoon ] illustrates ( top ) the total displacement and ( bottom ) the non - affine displacement along a slip line as a function of the distance away from the slip line .",
    "the change @xmath79 in the total displacement across the periodic cell is accommodated almost completely in a plastic zone of width @xmath64 .",
    "the total displacement in the surrounding elastic regions is nearly constant . subtracting the affine displacement associated with a strain @xmath0 leads to a small gradient @xmath80 in the elastic regions of plots of the non - affine displacement . for @xmath81",
    "the gradient in the plastic zone is much higher @xmath65 .",
    "traces through fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] and similar plots are roughly consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : slipcartoon ] . in all cases there",
    "are large regions where the total displacement is nearly constant , leading to a gradual slope @xmath82 in the non - affine displacement .",
    "the amount of strain accommodated in a plastic zone varies somewhat with the strain interval , particularly for slip lines that do not span the system and where there are multiple slip lines in a given strain interval ( fig . [",
    "fig : dispfieldcomponents ] bottom left ) .",
    "the edge of the plastic zone is also more diffuse than in fig .",
    "[ fig : slipcartoon ] , leading to a rounding of the peaks in the non - affine displacement .",
    "this rounding varies along the slip line as is evident from the fluctuations along the primary ridge in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] .",
    "these variations have important implications for the distributions discussed in the next section .",
    "the form of plots like fig . [ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] depends on strain , strain interval and system size . at very small strains ,",
    "the entire system responds elastically and the displacements are small . as the strain increases , the stress and rate of plasticity rise . for strains of 6% and greater",
    "we find that the system is in a nearly steady state . in this regime",
    ", plastic deformation tends to occur in a series of rapid `` avalanches '' with a wide range of sizes that will be discussed further in future work @xcite . between these avalanches",
    "the displacement field may be small , but the strain interval between avalanches decreases rapidly with system size . for the system size considered here , plastic zones that span a large fraction of the system",
    "are always observed for @xmath83 and this is the reason we focus on intervals of this order .",
    "many avalanches occur during this strain interval and they cluster spatially to produce the slip lines evident in fig .",

    "the evolution of the spatial organization of plastically deformed regions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldmags ] .",
    "the left hand side shows the _ magnitude _ of the non - affine displacement , @xmath2 , rather than individual components .",

    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] .",
    "the families of slip systems along both diagonals contribute equally to @xmath2 and are visible in the left hand panels .",
    "however , taking the magnitude of the displacement obscures the nature of the atomic rearrangements .",
    "the slip lines that appeared as sharp steps in @xmath77 and @xmath72 appear now as regions of _ low _",
    "@xmath2 surrounded by halos of higher @xmath2 .",
    "the origin of this behavior is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : slipcartoon ] . the peak displacements occur at the outer edges of the plastic zone at a distance of order @xmath84 from the center of the slip line .",
    "the magnitude drops rapidly to zero at the slip line and much more slowly in the elastic region outside .    a better measure of the local plastic response is provided by @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 field is clearly localized on the regions of strong shear and much smaller away from these regions . from fig .",
    "[ fig : slipcartoon ] we expect the shear strain to be of order @xmath0 in the elastic regions and much higher in the plastic regions that accommodate almost all the deformation of the cell .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath85 are consistent with this expectation .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath8 carries important information about the direction of slip .",
    "in particular , the two families of slip planes produce opposite signs , with a clockwise rotation along lines running parallel to @xmath86 and a counterclockwise rotation on perpendicular slip lines .",
    "thus plots of @xmath8 highlight the correlations along individual slip lines .",
    "the successive panels moving down figure [ fig : dispfieldmags ] show how displacements add as the strain interval increases . over short intervals",
    "@xmath87 we find that the displacements tend to organize along system - spanning lines .",
    "this allows the entire displacement to be accommodated in plastic zones with minimal energy stored in deformation of elastic regions .",
    "subsequent slip lines appear to occur at random locations rather than continuing to nucleate along the same path to produce a persistent shear band ( _ e.g. _ as in reference @xcite ) . one way of quantifying this is through the autocorrelation function for displacements over successive intervals .",
    "we find that this correlation function drops rapidly .",
    "by @xmath88 the correlations have dropped by about 2 orders of magnitude and are comparable to the noise . this is consistent with fig . [",
    "fig : dispfieldmags ] where we see a growing number of independent slip lines for @xmath89 .",
    "a superposition of randomly located slip lines is consistent with the diffusive growth in @xmath2 and @xmath8 discussed in the next section .",
    "the strain interval over which deformations are correlated depends on system size and seems to be related to a characteristic amplitude of the slip across plastic zones .",
    "examination of many plots like fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] shows that @xmath79 varies from about the mean particle diameter @xmath90 in the central region of shorter slip lines to about twice this value in a system spanning slip line like that in the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that once @xmath79 is of order a particle size it is energetically favorable to have plastic deformation everywhere along the slip line rather elastic deformation .",
    "note that the strain interval needed to produce a displacement @xmath79 is of order @xmath91 .",
    "this implies that throughgoing faults should occur over @xmath92 0.001 to 0.002 in our systems .",
    "our observations are consistent with this and analysis of the avalanche size distribution also shows that the largest events are spaced by @xmath93 .",
    "the plastic regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldcomponents ] and on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldmags ] have a significant width @xmath94 .",
    "thus the mean shear strain across these regions is only of order @xmath95 for @xmath96 . while this is an order of magnitude larger than the mean strain @xmath0 , the peak strains on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispfieldmags ] are higher still .",
    "each broad slip zone contains a number of much sharper features with strains that are an order of magnitude higher ( @xmath97 0.2 -0.4 ) .",
    "the width of these smaller features is only a few particle diameters .",
    "more detailed studies of the time dependence show that the slip zones are formed by a large number of avalanches that are spatially correlated to produce the system spanning lines in the figures .",
    "the long - range spatial correlations in the strain field are analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will focus below on the temporal evolution of the probability distribution of displacement magnitudes and @xmath8 .    comparing results for different system sizes",
    "indicates that @xmath64 increases roughly linearly with @xmath98 while the width of the high strain regions remains of order the particle diameter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the width of fault regions in earthquake systems also tends to scale in rough proportion to the length @xcite .",
    "studies of different system sizes also indicate that the slip amplitude along throughgoing faults is always of order one to two particle diameters",
    ". if @xmath79 is independent of system size , then the strain interval needed to produce a slip line should be inversely proportional to system size .",

    "while the linear rise of @xmath117 at large @xmath0 is consistent with diffusion , this only implies that the displacements of any given particle in successive strain intervals are uncorrelated .",

    "this is larger than the estimate of 3% strain required for plastic zones to cover the system , but as noted above , only a fraction of the plastic zones has the large strains indicative of local plasticity .",
    "although ours is , to our knowledge , the first study of strain distributions in simulations of sheared systems , several studies have looked at displacement distributions in athermal systems .",
    "all considered simple shear , @xmath143 , rather than the pure shear strain studied here .",
    "some simulations used quasi - static simulations with small strain steps  @xcite , while others used a constant slow shear rate as in our simulations  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - static studies all employed lennard - jones potentials and imposed simple shear with lees - edwards periodic boundary conditions  @xcite or rigid walls parallel to the flow direction  @xcite .",
    "ono and co - workers  @xcite simulated steady shear of wet foams using durian s bubble model  @xcite , while radjai and roux simulated granular media with dissipation entering through friction at particle contacts @xcite . only the latter work and our simulations include inertia . despite the wide range of protocols and interactions , almost all studies find diffusive behavior for the non - affine displacement . , @xmath144 .",
    "] the only exception is the work of radjai and roux  @xcite who found @xmath145 .",
    "it seems very important to determine the cause of this striking difference .",
    "the only unique feature of these simulations appears to be the incorporation of friction forces , which are not generally thought to lead to such qualitative changes in behavior .",
    "the value of the effective diffusion constant @xmath146 can be estimated from our observations of slip lines and the simple model in fig .",
    "[ fig : slipcartoon ] .",
    "this displacement field gives a constant distribution of displacements from @xmath147 to @xmath111 , implying a mean - squared displacement of @xmath148 .",
    "if system - spanning slip lines produce independent displacements at strain intervals of @xmath91 , then @xmath149 or @xmath150 . using the value of @xmath151 from fig .",
    "[ fig : meansquareddispandomega ] , one finds @xmath152 . improving the estimate of the mean - squared displacement from each slip line leads to larger values of @xmath79 since the actual distribution of displacements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : probdrseveral ] ) is cut off before @xmath111 .",
    "we conclude that the measured diffusion is consistent with the direct observation that slip lines have amplitudes of one to two particle diameters and contribute independently to the displacement .",
    "this model for the effective diffusion constant implies a linear scaling with system size .",
    "we have not yet examined this scaling directly , but recent studies of a similar model by lemaitre and caroli  @xcite showed a pronounced increase in @xmath153 with system size .",
    "data for the two largest systems , @xmath154 and 40 , appear consistent with linear scaling with @xmath155 .",
    "results for @xmath156 are larger than expected , but there may be significant finite size effects in these systems .",
    "note that we find @xmath157 so system sizes with @xmath158 could not have the plastic zone occupying the same fraction of the system . extrapolating lemaitre and caroli s result , , @xmath159 .",
    "the associated symmetric strain rate tensor associated with this flow field has a magnitude of @xmath160 , so one needs to scale the values of @xmath161 from reference  @xcite by a factor of @xmath162 to make a direct comparison to our results for _ pure _ shear geometry , @xmath163 . ] for @xmath164 , @xmath165 to @xmath166 yields @xmath167 , which is consistent to our measured value of @xmath168 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 needed to observe diffusive behavior is also roughly a factor of 25 smaller in our systems .",
    "these results provide a dramatic check of the linear scaling with system size in diffusion , although we caution that these comparisons should only be viewed qualitatively , as the impact of different shearing geometries has not been taken into account .",
    "lemaitre and caroli discuss the system - size dependence of their results in terms of displacements produced by independent avalanches rather than independent slip lines .",
    "earlier studies of individual plastic events showed that the rate of large avalanches scales with the system length  @xcite .",
    "based on the assumption that the total strain @xmath0 was accommodated by these avalanches , maloney and lemaitre concluded that the displacement @xmath169 associated with each avalanche was independent of system size and of order @xmath170 . extrapolating their results  @xcite for @xmath171 to our system sizes would give large avalanches spaced by @xmath172 , an order of magnitude more frequent than the rate of system - spanning slip lines in our simulations .",
    "this is consistent with our conclusion that the slip lines in figs .",
    "1 and 3 are not the result of individual avalanches , but the correlated displacement produced by multiple avalanches . assuming that each avalanche contributes independently to the displacement",
    "would give too small a value of @xmath153 .",
    "system size dependence of @xmath153 could be crucial in analyses which invoke the notion of an effective temperature based on an effective stokes - einstein relationship between @xmath153 and the viscosity @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "the product of diffusion and viscosity is related to the temperature in equilibrium systems . in systems with a yield stress , the viscosity diverges like the inverse strain rate , @xmath174 , at low strain rates where the stress reaches a plateau . as we ve seen here , one also expects the effective diffusion constant to grow linearly with the strain rate : @xmath175 .",
    "this means that the product of the viscosity and diffusivity should become constant at small enough strain rate : @xmath176 .",
    "however our results imply that this constant should have a dramatic size dependence , and one must proceed with caution to utilize it as an effective temperature",
    ".    the scaling of @xmath153 would be very different if the correlations in displacement did not span the system .",
    "there is some evidence that system spanning slip lines are suppressed by increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "they may also be suppressed by the surrounding fluid in experiments on colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "dissipation through flow in the fluid is reduced by maintaining a linear flow profile that may inhibit localization of the plastic deformation .",
    "studies of both effects would be of interest .",
    "the most important message in our results is that one must go beyond the second moments of the displacement and strain distributions to get insight into the microscopic processes at play in sheared systems .",
    "displacement distributions may be nearly gaussian , scaling with @xmath177 , while at the same time , there may be strong spatial correlations and heterogeneities in the system .",
    "the strain distributions can remain _ far _ from gaussian , even while the displacement distributions become nearly gaussian .",
    "such behavior provides a clear signature of spatial organization .",
    "furthermore , while individual particle trajectories may seem jerky with smooth motion interrupted by abrupt jumps , these jumps should not necessarily be interpreted as a particle escaping the cage formed by its neighbors ( as is often assumed to be the case ) , but could just as easily correspond to coherent displacement of the neighborhood with very little _ relative _ motion of particles . in the future , it will prove interesting to repeat the analysis here focusing on strain in addition to the more commonly studied displacement in thermal ( _ e.g. _ super - cooled liquids ) or brownian(_e.g .",
    "_ colloidal suspensions ) systems on approach to the jamming transition . this kind of measurement could serve as an important probe of the co - operative nature of the dynamics ."
