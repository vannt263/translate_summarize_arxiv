    "the nuclear data is one of the important sources of information about nucleon structure .",
    "first of all , it is connected with absence of a free neutron target for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments , what makes nuclear data the only source of information about neutron structure functions .",
    "another important advantage of the nuclear dis is access to the kinematic region of large bjorken @xmath1 that is unreachable in dis off the nucleon .",
    "for example , the average nuclear bjorken @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) corresponds to the very large nucleon @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , such study can not be performed without consistent separation of the nuclear and nucleon hard structure .",
    "the european muon collaboration demonstrated in the nuclear dis experiments that connection between the nuclear and nucleon hard structure can not be trivially explained by the fermi - motion of bound nucleons  @xcite , what was called the emc - effect .",
    "study of the @xmath5-dependence of the effect  @xcite and nuclear drell - yan scattering  @xcite together with the theoretical investigations performed within the qmc  @xcite and chiral soliton  @xcite models show that the emc - effect can not be understood without introducing nucleon structure change in nuclei , which is strongly model dependent .",
    "recently , the nuclear effects in dis were studied within a fully covariant approach  @xcite based on the bethe - salpeter equation . in the paper",
    "@xcite it was found that the emc - effect results from the fermi - motion of the bound nucleon in the four - dimensional space , which leads to the space- and time - smearing of the bound nucleon .",
    "the time - smearing leads to increase of the nucleon localization radius in the four - dimensional space , what corresponds to the explanation of the effect provided by the @xmath2rescaling model  @xcite . in a @xmath6d projection of the relativistic fermi - motion",
    "the time - smearing of the bound nucleon reduces to the dynamical distortions of the nucleon structure , which correspond to the nucleon structure change obtained within the qmc  @xcite and chiral soliton models  @xcite .",
    "consistent analytical calculations within this approach in the approximations of high @xmath2 and small binding energy give the following expression for the nuclear structure function : @xmath7 \\frac{f^{{\\rm n}/a}(m_a,{\\bf p})}{8m_{a}e_{\\rm n}e_{a-1}{\\delta^{\\rm n}_{a}}^2},\\label{f2a}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a function defined by the solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath9 is the nucleon on - shell energy , @xmath10 is the nucleon energy change due to the fermi motion ( @xmath11  kinetic energy of the fermi motion ) and binding ( @xmath12  binding energy of the nucleon ) .",
    "numerical calculations of the contributions of the different terms in eq.([f2a ] ) to the ratio @xmath13 are presented at fig.[fig1 ] a ) . the first term ( @xmath14 ) , which results from the fermi motion in @xmath6d - space ,",
    "is presented by the monotone increasing dashed curve . the second term ( @xmath15 ) depicted by the point - dashed curve results from the time - smearing of the bound nucleon .",
    "since @xmath16 and @xmath17 this term puts the ratio @xmath18 bellow unity in the middle @xmath1 region and , therefore , produces the emc - effect resulted from cancellation of the two large contributions .",
    "this result is presented by the solid curve , which fits to the experimental data within the experimental errors with rather good accuracy ( see fig.[fig1 ] b ) ) .",
    "contribution of the impulse approximation ( dashed curve @xmath19 ) and nucleon structure function derivative ( dashed - dot curve @xmath20 ) to the ratio of the @xmath21he and d structure functions .",
    "the experimental values are shown by the dark squares  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    due to the contribution of @xmath22 the expression ( [ f2a ] ) establishes a connection between the nuclear data and dynamics of parton distributions in the nucleon expressed by the nucleon structure function derivative .",
    "it is worth noting that according to ( [ f2a ] ) the functional behavior of the emc - ratio is defined by the nucleon structure function properties , since then the duality observed in @xmath23 can lead to the dual behavior of the @xmath24 in the kinematic region of high and low @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the experimental results obtained recently in  @xcite .",
    "let s consider eq.([f2a ] ) as an integral equation with the unknown function @xmath25 .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined by the existing experimental data .",
    "the boundary conditions for the equation are fixed with the help of asymptotics of the nucleon structure functions at @xmath28 and @xmath29 . introducing the neutron structure function @xmath30 as follows : @xmath31 we fix the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 by the boundary conditions . according to the limit @xmath37 , the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is fixed according to @xmath39 , which is model dependent .",
    "we study the three limits predicted by the following three different models .",
    "the quark model with su(6 ) symmetry gives @xmath40 .",
    "the elastic limit gives @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "the minimal value of the ratio has been predicted by the model with su(6 ) symmetry breaking with scalar diquark dominance  @xmath43 .",
    "+    assuming same asymptotic behavior for @xmath44 and @xmath30 at the limit @xmath0 : @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; we get that the derivative of @xmath47 at @xmath29 is zero .",
    "it constrains the following parameters of eq .",
    "( [ fanzats ] ) : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the remaining four parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) are used to fit eq .",
    "( [ f2a ] ) to the data for @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the result of the @xmath58 extraction is presented at fig.[fit ] a ) .",
    "the experimental data are obtained from the ratio @xmath59 within the naive approximation that neglect all nuclear effects in the deuteron . due to the cancellation of",
    "the fermi - motion and time - smearing discussed in the previous section the naive approximation works well up to @xmath60 , what explains the good agreement of the obtained here @xmath58 with the experimental data .",
    "this agreement is illustrated on fig.3 , which shows that at @xmath61 the correct accounting of the fermi motion in @xmath62d space becomes very important .",
    "the obtained nucleon structure function that contains inelastic channels only allows to study contribution of these channels to the elastic lepton scattering off the deuteron .",
    "calculation of the deuteron structure function at the point @xmath63 , which corresponds to the elastic scattering off the deuteron , we get the result presented at the fig.4 .",
    "thus , the nucleon resonances , contribution of which is presented by the dashed curve , can give sizable contribution to the lepton deuteron elastic scattering at high @xmath2 .",
    "the nuclear short - range structure can be expressed in terms of the nucleon structure and four - dimensional fermi motion of the nucleons .",
    "the time - smearing broadens the bound nucleon localization area , what lead to the observation of the nucleon structure change in nuclei ",
    "emc - effect .",
    "the pattern of the emc - effect is defined by cancellation of the two large contributions that are the @xmath6d fermi motion and the time - smearing of the bound nculeons , which are important at the average and large bjorken @xmath1 . due to the time - smearing the nuclear data enable direct access to the information about nucleon structure dynamics expressed by the nucleon structure function derivative , @xmath22 , that is difficult to detect in dis off the nucleon .",
    "better accuracy in @xmath59 data at @xmath64 can give information about the ratio @xmath65 at @xmath0 ( see fig.[fit ] b ) ) .",
    "study of the elastic limit of @xmath66 shows that nucleon structure excitations give sizable contribution to lepton deuteron elastic scattering at @xmath67 .    at the end",
