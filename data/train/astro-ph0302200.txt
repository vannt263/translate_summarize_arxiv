    "ngc 2516 is a rich , well studied , galactic open cluster .",
    "it has a low metallicity ( eg cameron 1985 , jeffries , james & thurston 1998 ) , is nearby ( @xmath0387pc ; jeffries , thurston & pye 1997 ) , is young ( @xmath1 years ; eg feinstein , marraco , mirabel et al 1973 ) and has a relatively low line of sight extinction . because of its low metallicity , it is an excellent target to test how coronal activity and stellar structure depend on metal content .",
    "ngc 2516 has been the subject of several studies in the x - ray band .",
    "it was observed using _",
    "rosat _ by dachs & hummel ( 1996 ) , jeffries , thurston & pye ( 1997 ) and micela et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "more recently it was the subject of a study using _ xmm - newton _",
    "( sciortino et al 2001 ) and also _ chandra _ ( harnden et al 2001 ) .",
    "these studies have concentrated on determining the cluster x - ray luminosity function : sciortino et al ( 2001 ) found that dwarf g and k stars in ngc 2516 were less luminous than those in the pleiades ( which has a similar age but solar metallicity ratio ) .",
    "in contrast , the luminosity function of dwarf m stars in ngc 2516 and the pleiades were indistinguishable .    in this paper",
    ", we show the results of a search for x - ray variable objects in ngc 2516 using _ xmm - newton _ data . with the relatively large number of x - ray objects it is an excellent target to determine the frequency of stellar flaring activity in a young , metal poor cluster .",
    "further , ngc 2516 has been observed on 8 occasions with _ xmm - newton _ since it has been used as a calibration target .",
    ".the observation log of _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 2516 .",
    "we show the _ xmm - newton _ orbit number and the observation i d .",

    "we have identified each of the 4 x - ray variable sources with an optical counterpart ( table [ sources ] ) .",
    "jeffries et al ( 1997 ) identify jtp122 as having an aov spectral type : the other 3 sources have not been classified spectroscopically .",
    "further , jtp138 and jtp122 were both classed as cluster members by king ( 1978 ) from a proper motion survey . to determine the likelihood of the other two sources being cluster members we plotted the @xmath2 , data of sung et al ( 2002 ) and traced the position of the main sequence .",
    "we then over - plotted the optical colours of our x - ray variable sources ( figure [ main ] ) .",
    "all 4 sources lie close to the main sequence of ngc 2516 : we conclude that each source is likely to be a cluster member .",
    "stellar coronal activity is common in stars which have a convective layer and a relatively rapid rotation period .",
    "enhanced levels of activity are often seen in close binary systems , for example the rs cvn systems which typically consist of a giant or sub - giant primary with a main - sequence or sub - giant companion . in many rs cvn systems",
    "the rotation of one of the components is synchronised with the orbital motion , leading to enhanced rotation and high levels of activity , seen as large spot coverage and flares in x - ray , optical and radio bands .",
    "additionally x - ray activity has also been seen on early - type stars , such as castor a and b. here it is thought the flaring component may originate from low - mass , late - type companions ( gdel at al .",
    "x - ray flares have also been reported in pre - main sequence stars ( eg schmidt 1994 ) and single solar type stars ( eg landini et al 1986 ) .",
    "the energy released in the x - ray flares we observed in ngc 2516 were @xmath3 ergs and lasted around 12 hrs .",
    "this contrasts to the energy released on a flare seen on algol ( 7@xmath4 ergs ) which lasted over a day ( ottmann & schmitt 1996 ) . in dwarf m stars flares",
    "have been seen in the @xmath5 band ( eg byrne , doyle & butler 1984 ) although they are relatively rare and last several 10 s of minutes . in x - rays ,",
    "dwarf m stars show flares of energies typically @xmath6 ergs with a duration less than 1 hour ( eg cheng & pallavicini 1991 ) .",
    "we consider that it is unlikely that the flares originate from pre - main sequence stars since ngc 2516 is not a star forming region .",
    "solar type stars have also been found to show flares in various energy bands with energies @xmath7 ergs , although they are very rare ( eg schaefer et al 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , flares have been seen on rs cvn systems which share similar characteristics to the flares we have observed .",
    "van den oord , mewe & brinkman ( 1988 ) estimated the energy released in a flare on the rs cvn system @xmath8 crb was 2.4@xmath9 ergs and lasted @xmath0 90 mins .",
    "further , they found clear evidence for a softening of the light curve after the sharp rise in flux .",
    "this is comparable to the rs cvn system ii peg which released @xmath10 ergs in a flare lasting more than several hours ( doyle et al 1991 , doyle , van der oord & kellett 1992 ) .",
    "their x - ray spectra are well modelled using a thermal plasma of a few kev .",
    "further , there are several instances where fe k@xmath11 emission has been seen in stars with active stellar coronae ( eg tsuru et al 1989 , gdel et al 2001 ) .",
    "we suggest that jtp 138 , jtp 80 and jtp 114 are good candidates for rs cvn systems .",
    "the fact that jtp 122 has been classified as ao v spectral type may indicate that it has a dwarf m star as a companion .",
    "followup spectroscopy will be able to test these assertions .",
    "( 8,5 ) ( -1.2,-0.5 )",
    "ngc 2516 has been observed using _ xmm - newton _ for 97.4 ksec ( cf table 1 ) .",
    "we detected 4 significantly variable x - ray sources over this time implying the detection of one x - ray variable source every @xmath025ksec .",
    "the first two observations were offset from the other observations by @xmath12 ( cf table 1 ) . in this first field",
    "we detected 113 x - ray sources and in the second 151 ( using the longest exposures in these fields ) .",
    "we detected 1 variable source in field 1 and 3 in field 2 .",
    "this gives 2.7@xmath13 variable x - ray sources per ksec per x - ray source in field 1 and 3.0@xmath13 in field 2 .",
    "although simplistic , if every source in the field was a potential x - ray variable source , then these rates would imply that each source would show a flare every @xmath040 days .",
    "flaring activity has been seen on the sun at many wavelengths and timescales .",
    "we have searched for solar flares that have a similar temporal profile to ` jtp 138 ' using the geostationary operational environmental satellites ( goes ) .",
    "the satellites are in geostationary orbit , their purpose being to monitor the sun s x - ray emission continuously .",
    "we have identified several solar flares which have similar timescales to that seen in jtp 138 .",
    "figure [ solar ] ( curve a ) shows the light curve of a ` small ' solar flare which has an intensity several orders of magnitude lower than the largest flares in the current solar cycle . like jtp 138",
    "it shows a small increase in flux ( lasting @xmath010 mins ) before a rapid rise which takes around 10 mins to reach maximum flux .",
    "we have estimated its temperature using ratios of the low energy channel on goes ( 1 - 8 , 1.512.4kev ) with the high energy channel ( 0.5 - 4 , 325kev ) .",
    "the temperature reached a maximum of 0.6 kev , with a luminosity of 7@xmath1410@xmath15 ergs s@xmath16 . the second example solar flare",
    "is also shown in figure [ solar ] ( curve b ) .",
    "this flare is brighter , and reaches a temperature of 0.8 kev , with a luminosity of 2@xmath1410@xmath17 ergs s@xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to the small solar flare and jtp 138 , there is no evidence for a pre - flare increase in flux .",
    "both solar flares last around 11.5 hrs , similar to jtp 138 . in figure [ solar2 ]",
    "we show the energy resolved light curve of the small solar flare .",
    "similar to the flare seen in jtp 138 , the solar flare reaches a maximum in hard x - rays earlier than in soft x - rays .",
    "( 8,4.5 ) ( -1,-1 . )    ( 8,5.5 ) ( -1.5,-7 . )    although the shape and duration of these solar flares are similar to that of jtp 138 , they have lower temperatures and much lower luminosities .",
    "the luminosity may simply be a reflection of the volume of the emitting plasma . in the case of rs cvn systems ,",
    "the flare size can extend to the size of the binary system ( or indeed , originate in the intra - binary region as seen in the rs cvn system cf tuc , gunn et al 1997 ) . for reasonable system parameters and an orbital period of 2 days ,",
    "the separation is @xmath18 cm .",
    "moreover , the suns rotation rate has been slowing down since it joined the main sequence .",
    "it therefore has lower magnetic activity compared to stars which have recently joined the main sequence ( as in the case of stars in ngc 2516 ) .",
    "numerous explanations for the triggering mechanism of solar flares have been developed over the years .",
    "the most popular current theory for converting magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energies is that of magnetic reconnection ( eg priest & forbes 1999 ) .",
    "the site of the reconnection takes place high in the solar corona above magnetic loops , or between at least two loop systems that interact . at the reconnection site ,",
    "the electrons are accelerated and move along the loops with a high velocity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "some of these electrons will bombard the chromosphere which is denser and cause this plasma to be heated .",
    "this plasma will then evaporate into the loops causing the soft x - ray emission such as is shown in figure 5 ( cf harra 2000 for more details ) .",
    "although the details are still uncertain , observations support this view .",
    "feldman , laming & doschek ( 1995 ) found a correlation between solar and stellar flare temperatures and emission measures .",
    "shibata & yokoyama ( 1999 ) proposed a model based on a magnetic reconnection model with heat conduction and chromospheric evaporation to account for this correlation . based on our spectral fits to jtp 138",
    ", we find an emission measure of 7@xmath20 @xmath21 for jtp 138 .",
    "for a temperature of 6@xmath22 k for the hot component , figure 1 of shibata & yokoyama ( 1999 ) suggests a magnetic field strength of @xmath0100 g for this source .",
    "measuring stellar magnetic field strengths is difficult .",
    "however , observations of various rs cvn systems show evidence for magnetic field strengths of the order @xmath01001000 g ( eg donati 1999 ) , indicating that a field strength of 100 g for jtp 138 is reasonable .",
    "we have performed a x - ray time variability survey of the open cluster ngc 2516 . we have found 4 systems which have shown significant variability .",
    "three of these systems show light curves which are characteristic of stellar flaring activity .",
    "based on the flare duration and their spectral properties we suggest that they are rs cvn systems .",
    "the fourth system has been identified with a ao v type star and propose that it may have an unseen dwarf m star which shows flaring activity .",
    "an optical spectroscopic study of these objects is required .",
    "finally , this study shows that open clusters are excellent objects to search for stellar flaring activity and may be relatively common .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
