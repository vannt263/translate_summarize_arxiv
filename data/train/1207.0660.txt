    "_ no - regret strategies _ are simple adaptive learning rules that recently received a lot of attention in the literature . in a repeated game ,",
    "a player has a _ regret _ for an action if , loosely speaking , she could have obtained a greater average payoff had she played that action more often in the past . in the course of the game",
    ", the player reinforces actions that she regrets not having played enough , for instance , by choosing next action with probability proportional to the regret for that action , as in hart and mas - colell s @xcite _ regret matching _ rule .",
    "existence of _ no - regret strategies _",
    "( i.e. , strategies that guarantee no regrets almost surely in the long run ) is known since @xcite ; wide classes of no - regret strategies are identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a _ no - regret dynamics _ is a stochastic process that describes trajectories of the average correlated play of players and that emerges when every player follows a no - regret strategy ( different players may play different strategies ) . by definition",
    ", it converges to the hannan set ( the set of all correlated actions that satisfy the no - regret condition first stated by @xcite).the hannan set of a game is also known as the set of _ weak correlated equilibria _ @xcite or _ coarse correlated equilibria _",
    "* ch.3 ) . ]",
    "this set is typically large .",
    "it contains the set of correlated equilibria of the game and we show that it may even contain correlated actions that put positive weight _ only _ on strictly dominated actions .",
    "thus convergence of the average play to the hannan set often provides very little information about what the players will actually play , as it does not even imply exclusion of strictly dominated actions .    in this paper",
    "we show that no - regret dynamics are intimately linked to the classical fictitious play process @xcite . drawing on @xcite ,",
    "we first show that contrary to the standard , discrete - time version , continuous fictitious play leads to no regret .",
    "we then show that , for a large class of no - regret dynamics , if a player s maximal regret is @xmath1 , then she plays an @xmath0-best reply to the average correlated play of the others . since in this class",
    "the maximal regret vanishes ( see corollary [ cor:1 ] below ) , it follows that , for a good choice of behavior when all regrets are negative , the dynamics is a vanishingly perturbed version of fictitious play .    for two - player finite games ,",
    "this observation and the theory of perturbed differential inclusions @xcite allow us to relate formally the asymptotic behavior of no - regret dynamics and of continuous fictitious play ( or its time - rescaled version , the best - reply dynamics @xcite ) . in classes of games",
    "in which the behavior of continuous fictitious play is well known , this provides substantial information on the asymptotic behavior of no - regret dynamics .",
    "in particular , we recover most known convergence properties of no - regret dynamics .",
    "our results do not just allow us to find new and sometimes much shorter proofs of convergence of no - regret dynamics towards the set of nash equilibria in some classes of games , such as dominance solvable game or potential games .",
    "they also allow us to relate the asymptotic behavior of no - regret dynamics and continuous fictitious play in case of divergence , as in the famous shapley game @xcite .",
    "these results extend only partially to @xmath2-player games ( though they fully extend to @xmath2-player games with linear incentives @xcite ) .",
    "the issue is that in @xmath2-player games no - regret dynamics turn out to be related to the correlated version of continuous fictitious play , in which the players play a best - reply to the _ correlated _ past play of the others .",
    "this version of fictitious play is defined through a correspondence which is not convex valued .",
    "this creates technical difficulties , because the theory of perturbed differential inclusions is not developed for non convex valued correspondences .",
    "a different way to analyze no - regret dynamics is to show that some sets attract nearby solution trajectories .",
    "we show that strict nash equilibria and , more generally , the intersection of the hannan set and the sets that are _ _ closed under rational behavior ( curb ) _ _ are attracting for no - regret dynamics , in a sense to be defined in section [ sec : curb ] .",

    "(  better \" with respect to her average realized payoff ) .",
    "it is well known that discrete fictitious play does not lead to _ no regret _ @xcite .",
    "consider the following example :    @xmath147    because @xmath148 is irrational , @xmath149 and @xmath150 can not both be best - replies to the empirical past play of the other player .",
    "thus , any dfp process is entirely determined by its first move .",
    "assume that the first move is off the diagonal , say @xmath151 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the game and the absence of ties , both players always switch to another action simultaneously .",
    "therefore the play is locked off the diagonal and the maximal regret is at least @xmath152 at any stage .",
    "this holds in the mixed extension of the game , since at any stage the players have a unique , pure best reply .",
    "since the continuous fictitious play process is a continuous - time version of dfp , intuitively , it should not lead to _ no regret _ either .",
    "the following result  a generalization of theorem d of @xcite  shows that this intuition is misleading .",
    "[ p : cfp ] under any solution of continuous fictitious play , the average correlated play converges to the reduced hannan set .",
    "this discrepancy between dfp and cfp may be explained as follows . playing an action with positive",
    "regret decreases the regret for this action . in cfp , roughly , when an action is played it remains a best reply , hence it is associated with maximal regret for a small time increment .",
    "precisely , the derivative of the regret for the action played is equal to the derivative of the maximal regret .",
    "since the regret for this action decreases , so does the maximal regret .",
    "in contrast , in dfp , an action played at stage @xmath23 has maximal regret at stage @xmath23 , but not necessarily at stage @xmath153 .",
    "thus the fact that the regret for this action decreases does not entail that the maximal regret does .    for comparison with (",

    "[ rem : uni ] in the proof , we did not use that @xmath168 is a best - reply to @xmath169 .",
    "this shows that the fact that cfp leads to no - regret is a unilateral property .",
    "that is , if a player s behavior evolves according to cfp , then she has no asymptotic regret , independently of her opponent s behavior ( see also @xcite ) .    cfp and",
    "the best - reply dynamics converge to the set of nash equilibria in finite zero - sum games @xcite .",
    "the usual proof is to show that the  duality gap \" @xmath170 converges to zero .",
    "this follows from the above proof , since in a two - player zero sum game @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is a solution of cfp and @xmath11 the associated correlated play .      in the previous subsection we showed that cfp leads to no regret",
    "conversely , we now show that any no - regret dynamics in class @xmath173 ( as defined in section [ sec : prelim ] ) is closely related to cfp .",
    "we first explain the intuition .",
    "denote by @xmath174 the set of @xmath0-best replies of player @xmath5 to the mixed action @xmath115 of her opponent : @xmath175 the crucial observation is the following .",
    "[ lm0 ] assume that the maximal regret is less than @xmath0 .",
    "then any action with positive regret is an @xmath0-best reply to the average play of the opponent .",

    "but by assumption @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , @xmath178 @xmath179 , and @xmath20 is an @xmath0-best reply to @xmath137 .    since no - regret dynamics in class @xmath80 only pick actions with positive regret , they only pick @xmath0-best replies to the average play of the others , where @xmath0 is the maximal regret .",
    "since this maximal regret approaches zero almost surely , eventually only almost - exact best replies are picked .",
    "this provides the intuition why no - regret dynamics and fictitious play may exhibit similar asymptotic behavior . finding a precise link , however , is not obvious .",
    "for instance , there could exist actions that are @xmath180-best replies in each period @xmath23 , with @xmath181 , but never exact best replies .",
