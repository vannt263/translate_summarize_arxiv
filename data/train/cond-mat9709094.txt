    "the interest on degenerate electron - lattice interaction ( jahn - teller effect ) in molecules and impurity centers in solids started in the @xmath1s and found large fields of application in the @xmath2s . in recent years",
    "the interest is coming back , excited by the realization of new systems of this type calling for a revision of a number of commonly accepted beliefs .",
    "one of these systems , fullerene , is an highly symmetric icosahedral molecule : this symmetry group implies large representations , thus large degeneracies of the interacting electronic and vibrational states of the isolated ion .",
    "new jahn - teller ( jt ) systems have therefore been studied , and they have been shown to imply new exciting properties .",
    "a particularly new and surprising one has been demonstrated recently : the possibility of a change in symmetry of the ground state .    the molecular symmetry reduction associated to the splitting of the electronic state degeneracy",
    "is restored , as it is known for longtime , in the vibronic ground state thanks to the dynamical jt effect ( djt ) , i.e.the coherent tunneling among equivalent distortions . in all jt systems known till few years ago , for single - electron occupancy , it was generally accepted an empiric `` symmetry conservation rule '' , sometimes known as `` ham s theorem '' , stating that the symmetry of the vibronic djt ground state , at any coupling strength , remains the same as that of the electronic multiplet prior to coupling@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , not required by any general constraint in the jt physics can be seen as the fingerprint of a berry phase in the entangled electronic - phononic dynamics , in turn an apparently general feature .",
    "new excitement sprung from the discovery of the first dynamical jt system where the ground state is _ not _ degenerate in the strong coupling limit , thus a system which is berry - phase free@xcite .",
    "this is the model that in spherical symmetry is indicated as @xmath3 , where electrons of angular momentum @xmath4 interact with vibrations also belonging to an @xmath5 representation .",
    "this system is relevant to the physics of fullerene ions c@xmath6 , where the 5-fold degenerate electronic state has @xmath7 icosahedral label and the quadrupolar distortions correspond to some of the @xmath8 modes@xcite .",
    "it has been shown both analytically and numerically that a nondegenerate state in the vibronic spectrum moves down for increasing coupling , to cross the 5-fold ground state at some finite value of the coupling parameter , thus becoming the ground state at strong coupling .    in this paper",
    "we consider more in general the possibility of nondegenerate vibronic ground states , and their compatibility with the presence of a berry phase in the coupled dynamics .",
    "according to the general theory of the jt effect , an @xmath9-fold degenerate electronic level corresponding to a representation @xmath10 of the symmetry group of the molecule can interact with the vibrational modes corresponding to representations @xmath11 contained in the symmetric part of @xmath12 ( excluding the identical representation which is trivial ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the case where exactly one mode @xmath13 of each symmetry label @xmath14 is present and interacts linearly with strength @xmath15 with the @xmath9-fold degenerate electronic level is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimension of the @xmath14 representation ( and analogously for @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the symmetry group @xmath20 of the molecule . in ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "we choose the real representation for the vibrational degrees of freedom , and a second - quantized notation for the electrons .    in the special case where all frequencies @xmath21 and couplings @xmath22 are equal , the symmetry group of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is raised to @xmath23 and the problem reduces to a single - mode jt coupling between two representations of that group@xcite . within this context",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the set of minima of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential , corresponding to the most convenient classical distortions , constitute a continuous manifold , referred to as jahn - teller manifold ( jtm ) . in particular , due to the smooth adiabatic mapping from the vibrational to the electronic sphere ( meaning that to every point on the jtm there corresponds a precise electronic eigenstate of the electron - vibron interaction operator ) , the jtm shares the same symmetry and topological properties of the electronic hilbert space .",
    "since the hamiltonian for the jt problems we consider is real , the electronic space is a sphere @xmath24 in the @xmath9-dimensional real vector space .",
    "this sphere has @xmath23 symmetry and , because of the mapping , the jtm is also invariant for transformation under the group @xmath23 , and not just @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the points on the electronic sphere are defined modulo a sign ( identification of the antipodes , representing the same electronic state ) . consequently , from the topological point of view , the electronic sphere is a multiply connected manifold .",
    "due once more to the smooth mapping , the jtm is also multiply connected .",
    "when the system goes along a closed path on the jtm and the electronic state follows adiabatically , it may happen that the final electronic state differs from the initial state by a change of sign . in the most general case of a multiply connected jtm ,",
    "there are no smooth deformations of the closed path in vibrational space such that this _ anomaly _ can be eliminated .",
    "this is the essence of the berry phase in djt systems : the electronic state , in the adiabatic approximation , induces non trivial phases onto the vibrational dynamics .",
    "in the perspective of moving to the general case of different couplings @xmath22 s , it is instructive to first consider the extreme case where only one of the couplings @xmath22 is nonzero . problems of this kind are , for example , @xmath25 in cubic symmetry and @xmath0 in icosahedral symmetry . in particular",
    "the latter case is of interest because the icosahedral group is non simply reducible , so that there are two different coupling schemes for the @xmath0 problem@xcite . while one of them is unique to the discrete - group features of the icosahedral group , the other coupling may be chosen to coincide with the @xmath3 jt system introduced above .    in this very special case , due to the symmetry properties of the clebsch - gordan coefficients of @xmath26",
    ", even if the hamiltonian has @xmath26 symmetry only , the jtm shares the same symmetry properties of the electronic sphere , which here is the four - dimensional unit sphere @xmath27 in the five - dimensional electronic space ( with opposite points identified ) .",
    "the jtm of the @xmath3 system is therefore also a four - dimensional manifold , immersed in the five - dimensional space of distortions , enjoying complete @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "the only possible manifold satisfying these requirements , is isomorphic to another sphere @xmath27 . yet",
    "a sphere @xmath27 in a five dimensional space is a simply - connected object , whereas the electronic sphere is not .",
    "therefore some _ pathology _ is to be expected in the adiabatic mapping from the vibrational space to the electronic one . in particular",
    ", there must exist at least one loop on the electronic sphere which maps to a single point in vibrational space : under this condition , it is possible to drag and deform smoothly any path connecting a point to its antipode on the electronic sphere ( corresponding to a closed path in vibrational space ) to this _ pathological _ path , which is equivalent to one point in the distortion sphere .",
    "this mechanism eliminates the berry phase anomaly for this problem . as a consequence , as anticipated above , the strong - coupling ground state is non degenerate .",
    "the main reasons for the elimination of the berry phase in the @xmath29 model are therefore the symmetry of the clebsch - gordan coefficients and the exact matching of the dimensions of the electronic and vibrational spaces : together they force the jtm to become a plain ( simply - connected ) sphere . in larger spaces of distortions ,",
    "the jtm can be both @xmath23-symmetric and multiply connected , and in all known cases it really is .",
    "this mechanism being clear , we predict that all the @xmath26 coupling schemes of the type @xmath30 , with even @xmath31 are djt systems with no berry - phase entanglement .",
    "in particular , the strong - coupling ground state for this whole class of systems is non degenerate .",
    "we verified by numerical diagonalization that this is indeed the case for the @xmath32 case : an @xmath33 state originating ( at weak coupling ) from the one - quantum multiplet , at @xmath34 crosses down below the @xmath35 vibronic state which was the weak - coupling ground state .",
    "such kind of highly - symmetric systems may have applications for small to medium - sized atomic clusters , or in odd-@xmath36 nuclei .",
    "this result has a great relevance to the cases of coupling to a single mode , but it is necessary to be careful in drawing general conclusions from it .",
    "one of the main results of this work is indeed that in a many - mode situation , _ the presence of a berry phase does not automatically guarantee the degeneracy of the ground state _ of the system .",
    "this point is made very clear in the @xmath37 case ( an @xmath38 electronic state linearly coupled to two spherical modes of symmetry @xmath5 and @xmath39 respectively ) . in that case , for equal frequencies and couplings of the two modes , it was shown@xcite that the overall underlying symmetry of the model is @xmath28 .",
    "for this special case , the presence of a berry phase has been explicitly demonstrated , as well as its consequences for the allowed levels . in the general case @xmath40",
    ", the symmetry is reduced to the original @xmath26 and the large @xmath28 representations split into the @xmath26 ones . in particular , in the limit @xmath41 , the vibronic spectrum of @xmath3 model is recovered . for @xmath42 there is no berry phase , and for @xmath43 the ground state is a vibronic nondegenerate @xmath33 state separated by a finite energy gap from the first @xmath44-fold degenerate @xmath4 excited state@xcite .",
    "the continuous lowering of @xmath45 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 describes a smooth mapping of a situation with a berry phase entanglement ( and a degenerate ground state ) to a case where this entanglement disappears ( nondegenerate ground state ) .",
    "this implies a new case of level crossing , at some intermediate value of @xmath45 .",
    "in particular we have a crossover value of @xmath45 for which the @xmath33 and @xmath4 states become degenerate . at strong coupling the energy gap @xmath48-e[l=0 ] = c_2 \\omega_2 /g_2 ^ 2 + o(g_2^{-4})$ ] for @xmath47 and @xmath48-e[l=0 ] = -c_4 \\omega_4 /g_4 ^ 2 + o(g_4^{-4})$ ] for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are positive constants .",
    "the curve of crossover points in the @xmath52 plane must get therefore asymptotically close to the straight line @xmath53 at strong coupling .",
    "these considerations permit to draw the zero - temperature `` phase diagram '' represented in fig .",
    "[ phased : fig ] .",
    "this intuitive picture captures the correct physics of the system , and it is noteworth for describing a whole region of the phase diagram where the presence of a berry phase coexists with a nondegenerate @xmath33 ground state . we need to reconcile the gradual , smooth effect of turning on the coupling to the @xmath54 mode , with the abrupt appearance of a berry phase , which is a topological effect , intrinsically non - perturbative , as soon as @xmath55 .",
    "in actuality , for any @xmath56 , the 30-fold degenerate first - excited state ( labeled [ 3,0 ] according to @xmath28 ) of the @xmath57 `` hypersymmetrycal '' spectrum is split@xcite into its @xmath58 components ( @xmath26 representations ) .",
    "in particular the @xmath33 fragment is the lowest one when @xmath59 . for small enough @xmath60",
    ", this nondegenerate state has the opportunity to localize as much as possible in the ( hyper)spherical potential well in the @xmath5 vibron space , therefore becoming the ground state . even in this limit",
    ", however , the berry phase prescription is globally respected , since the @xmath33 ( nondegenerate ) ground state is really a fragment of an odd ( [ 3,0 ] ) level selected by the berry phase : the ground state still fulfills the parity constraint imposed to the low - energy @xmath28 representations by the berry phase in the global @xmath61 space .",
    "note however that the same @xmath33 state , if seen restricted to the @xmath5 vibration space , is naturally classified as an [ 0,0 ] state for the symmetry group ( @xmath28 again ) of the jtm .",
    "throughout our discussion we implicitly assumed a linear jt coupling scheme as described by ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the introduction of quadratic terms has usually effects similar to those produced by different linear coupling @xmath62 in cubic symmetry@xcite , i.e.  of `` warping '' the jtm .",
    "the symmetry of the hamiltonian , as a consequence , is reduced to the symmetry group @xmath20 of the molecule , and so is that of the jtm . yet , the properties of connectedness are topological properties , being therefore robust against perturbations such as the warping : even if the symmetry is reduced , the consequence of the presence / absence of the berry phase on the ground - state symmetry are unchanged .",
    "ham@xcite has shown in particular , for the @xmath63 coupling scheme , that the introduction of quadratic terms in the hamiltonian , although splitting specific degeneracies of excited states , does not substantially change the picture as far as the berry phase and the degeneracy of the ground state are concerned .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the presence / absence of the berry phase is not a sufficient criterion to decide whether the ground state is degenerate or not at strong coupling .",
    "however , the absence of a berry phase in at least one of the subsystem seems to be a necessary condition for having a non - degenerate ground state .",
    "we also illustrate the relevance of the actual values of the coupling strengths between electrons and vibrations , that only can really decide about the symmetry of the ground state . in this perspective",
    ", the experimental or _ ab - initio _ determination of the actual values of such couplings is of the utmost importance for practical systems such as those based on positive fullerene ions .",
    "finally , we propose evidence for a whole family , following the @xmath3 , of berry - phase  free dynamical jt systems whose strong - coupling ground state is , as a consequence , nondegenerate .",
    "we are thankful to erio tosatti , lu yu , and mary obrien for useful discussion ."
