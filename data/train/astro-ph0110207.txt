    "although presently classified as a dwarf nova , wz sge is peculiar in many respects .",
    "the star exhibited three historical outbursts ( 1913 , 1946 , 1978 ) separated by 32.5 years , and most recently experienced its fourth outburst in 2001 (; ) .",
    "the light curves of its outbursts resemble that of a fast nova in that they show 1 ) a rapid initial decline , 2 ) a subsequent slower decline lasting 60 to 100 d=14.4 on 1979 april 8 , 128 d after the initial outburst detection .",
    "further observational evidence for this phenomenon is rather sparse ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , than is generally believed . ] , and 3 ) large ( @xmath08 mag ) outburst amplitudes . from these features ,",
    "the object had been long believed to be a recurrent nova ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also a historical review by @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric observations during the 1978 outburst , however , confirmed that wz sge is a dwarf nova , and not a classical nova .",
    "the most striking discovery was the presence of superhumps by @xcite ( for a review of superhumps , see @xcite ) , which are characteristic to su uma - type dwarf novae [ see @xcite for a review of dwarf novae ; see also @xcite for basic observational properties , and for a more recent review of su uma - type stars ] .",
    "there had been several competing theories to explain the peculiar nature of wz sge .",
    "one is the mass - transfer burst model , which was used to explain the large - amplitude periodic humps early in its 1978 outburst @xcite .",
    "the period of the humps was equal to the orbital period ( @xmath1 ) , and they were considered to reflect the hot spot enhanced by the mass - transfer burst , although the hump maxima occurred 0.17 orbital phase prior to the orbital humps in quiescence .",
    "the other is the extension of thermal and tidal instability theory of su uma - stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) towards the lowest mass - transfer rate @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that thermal instability of the accretion disk occurs rarely in such conditions , and it always leads to the tidal instability to trigger a superoutburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed the evaporation of the inner disk , and argued that rare outbursts can be caused by a small increase of the mass - transfer rate , without an assumption of the very low quiescent viscosity .",
    "this scenario may be considered as a combination of the mass - transfer burst model and the disk instability model ( see , however , the arguments by @xcite and @xcite on the scenario of @xcite ) .",
    "some wz sge - type dwarf novae are known to show complex post - superoutburst rebrightening(s ) , which are rarely seen in other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the most remarkable objects are eg cnc (; ; ) , and wz sge itself ( the 2001 superoutburst : ishioka et al . in preparation ) . in order to explain this unique feature , @xcite proposed a working model , in which the the disk viscosity in post - superoutburst wz sge - type stars are somehow maintained higher than that the pre - superoutburst level .",
    "although the underlying physical mechanism was not clear ar the time of the initial proposition , @xcite further succeeded to explain , by a combination of the schemes of @xcite , @xcite and the decay of magnetic turbulence in the quiescent dwarf nova disk @xcite , the variety of phenomena in wz sge - type dwarf novae .    from the observational side , discrimination of the theories",
    "has been difficult owing to the rarity of outbursts of wz sge .",
    "searches for more `` wz sge - type '' objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) among dwarf novae have been a natural consequence of the motivation to confirm the universality of the features found in wz sge itself . in spite of the efforts ,",
    "a number of the candidates have turned out to be rather normal su uma - stars exhibiting normal outbursts ( e.g. wx cet ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) , and vy aqr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) see also @xcite and references therein ) , and the attempt remained rather unsuccessful .",
    "hv vir was discovered by @xcite in outburst on 1929 february 11 .",
    "( b , ) identified the object as a classical nova based on its large outburst amplitude and its light curve constructed from his examination of archival plates .",
    "however , we suspected it to be a wz sge - type dwarf nova because of its high galactic latitude ( @xmath2= , @xmath3=+ , which makes hv vir a very distant ( @xmath0100 kpc ) , halo or even an extragalactic object based on the usual absolute maximum magnitude vs rate - of - decline ( mmrd ) relation of galactic novae ( originally proposed by @xcite and formulated by @xcite .",

    "this suggestion was strengthened by our unpublished ccd photometry in quiescence ( 1990 ) which showed possible humps separated by 84@xmath44 m , a period very close to that of wz sge ( 81.6 min ) .",
    "hv vir was again caught in outburst at visual magnitude 12.0 on 1992 april 20.928 ut , when the object was still brightening @xcite .",
    "the outburst was subsequently confirmed photoelectrically with a conspicuous ultraviolet excess , and the maximum was probably reached on april 21.4 at @xmath5=11.5 @xcite .",
    "we started photometric observations within a day of the maximum , on april 22 , using the multicolor photoelectric polarimeter at the dodaira station , national astronomical observatory , japan , and later using a ccd camera at ouda station , kyoto university .",
    "this early time - resolved photometry eventually enabled us to elucidate the nature of the object .",

    "a very gradual change of the extinction of the sky was calibrated using this local standard , and was interpolated to estimate the magnitude of the variable . because the observed color was almost constant throughout the runs , we added the counts of the seven color bands covering 360  800 nm , after correcting for atmospheric extinction in each band , and obtained `` white - light '' magnitudes to achieve the best signal - to - noise ratio for detecting small amplitude variations .",

    "this finding is compatible with the slow growth rate , which has been shown to be proportional to the square of the mass ratio @xmath31 ( 2subyearlub91shalub91shba , b ) , expected from the estimated small mass - ratio of hv vir , and also strengthens the classification of hv vir as a wz sge - type object .",
