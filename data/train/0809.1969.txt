    "altogether , we are now left with an effective low - energy hilbert - space spanned by the six lowest lying three - electron states : @xmath32 ( i.e. \\{_spin , hole , particle _ } ) , together with the spin - index @xmath33 .",

    "these lead only to a constant offset in the differential conductance of the order of @xmath53 , which can be neglected in our qualitative study .",
    "details of the calculation , including the expression for the coupling functions @xmath54 , are given in appendix  [ app : j ] .",
    "note that when calculating the effective cotunneling amplitudes in the appendix , we retain the differences in energy - denominators of the different amplitudes , i.e. at this stage we do not make the approximation that @xmath55 .",
    "the according differences in amplitudes expresses the broken orbital symmetry of the model , even with all six tunneling - amplitudes being equal .",
    "nevertheless , in order for the schrieffer - wolff transformation to be meaningful , we must demand these differences to be small , and in all our numerical calculations we therefore choose a large charging energy ( @xmath56 ) which effectively makes all energy denominators equal .",
    "in other words , retaining @xmath57 in the denominators of the cotunneling amplitudes would require a more careful treatment of charge - fluctuations .",
    "when the bias voltage is large enough to populate the excited states on the dot , these will no longer be thermally occupied  @xcite .",

    "as mentioned before , the ndc is driven by the population inversion between @xmath116 and @xmath115 . as argued in the previous section , the positive bias drives the dot into the excited state @xmath115 , and since ( for these parameters ) this state leads to a lower current than @xmath116 , the current decreases and we observe the ndc .",
    "the poor cotunneling across the dot in the state @xmath115 is a simple consequence of the double occupancy of the well - coupled orbital 2 , which demands that orbital 2 is emptied to the right lead before it can be filled from the left , thus making use of the strong coupling @xmath151 .",
    "in contrast , starting in @xmath116 one can also fill in an electron in orbital 2 from the left lead first and then tunnel out into the right lead from either orbital 2 or from orbital 1 , thus allowing more current - carrying tunneling processes involving @xmath151 .",
    "thus a sufficiently strong difference in coupling to two of the orbitals will cause a population inversion with a concomitant decrease in the current as bias is increased . for intermediate coupling asymmetry ,",
    "we see from the other curves in fig .  [ fig : didvasym ] that the ndc disappears while an asymmetry in bias remains .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : cntdat ] were recorded on the same sample as was discussed in ref .  .",
    "in fact , this is the neighboring charge - state to the even number occupied state studied in that work . in ref .  , some of the present authors obtained a very gratifying fit to the inelastic cotunneling line reflecting a strong transition from singlet ground- to an excited triplet state . in particular",
    ", it was argued that the very sharp cotunneling line could only arise from the joint effect of nonequilibrium pumping ( finite - bias occupations ) of the triplet state and substantial logarithmic enhancements from the nonequilibrium kondo - effect .",
    "as already stated , we shall not embark on higher order perturbation theory in this paper , which means that we should not expect to obtain any quantitative agreement with the data in fig .",

    "how , and if , this would work out in detail will be assessed in future work .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the inelastic cotunneling spectroscopy of a system with three electrons distributed among three orbitals .",
    "starting from the 3-orbital anderson model in the coulomb blockade regime , we have projected out charge - fluctuations and derived an effective cotunneling ( kondo ) model describing elastic as well as inelastic tunneling induced transitions between different orbital and spin states of the impurity or quantum dot in the n=3 charge - state . by treating all tunnel couplings independently we can study asymmetric behavior inherent to most of the experimental samples .",
    "all calculations were performed within second order nonequilibrium perturbation theory , and the bias dependent nonequilibrium occupations of the impurity - states were shown to give rise to marked cusps at voltages matching the different transitions .",
    "we demonstrate how a bias induced _ cascade _ in the occupations can lead to indirect transitions between two excited states .",
    "furthermore , we find that certain asymmetries in the tunneling amplitudes of the three orbitals can lead to a _ population inversion _ , which in turn can be accompanied by lines of negative differential ( _ cotunneling _ ) conductance ( ndc ) .",
    "we have revisited the carbon nanotube data from ref .",
    "with focus on an odd occupied charge - state . importing the tunnel - couplings inferred from ref .",
    ", we confirm the asymmetry in the conductance strength at positive and negative bias .",
    "these parameters lead to steps at finite - bias at the orbital transitions , and we believe that the experimentally observed peaks are mainly due to logarithmic enhancements from a nonequilibrium kondo - effect .",
    "we have also analyzed the inas - wire data from ref .   in greater detail and provided an explanation of the bias - asymmetry in peak-_positions_. this",
    "was understood as a slight difference in the two level - spacings together with an asymmetry in the tunnel - coupling of orbital 2 to source and drain electrodes .",
    "this asymmetry in couplings was roughly consistent with the overall stability diagram for the n=3 diamond , as confirmed by a semiclassical rate - equation calculation .",
    "finally , we have pointed to an additional consequence of strong spin - orbit coupling in the inas - wires , namely the apparent @xmath178-dependence of the level - spacing caused by different g - factors for different orbitals . in the present experiment",
    "this difference was too small to give a noticeable effect , but with differences as quoted in ref",
    ".   it should be a pronounced effect  .",
    "possible further influence of strong spin - orbit coupling on the cotunneling spectroscopy of inelastic spin and orbital transitions constitutes an interesting problem on its own right and will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "we thank m.  mason , l.  dicarlo , c.  m.  marcus ( harvard university ) , m.  aagesen , and c.  b.  srensen ( niels bohr institute ) for contributions to the experiments .",
    "furthermore we like to thank s.  csonka , m.  trif , d.  stepanenko , v.  golovach and b.  trauzettel for valuable discussions .    this work has been supported by the dfg - center for functional nanostructures ( cfn ) at the university of karlsruhe ( s.sch .  and p.  w. ) , the institute for nanotechnology , research center karlsruhe ( p.  w. ) , the danish agency for science , technology and innovation and the danish natural science research council ( j.  p. , t.  s.  j. , j.  n. ) , the swiss nsf and the nccr nanoscience ( v.  k. ) .",
    "in this work we concentrate on the physics inside a coulomb diamond where the 3-level quantum dot is occupied by exactly three electrons . all virtual processes to two or four electron states",
    "can be treated perturbatively and lead to a kondo - like interaction and potential scattering terms .    using a schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite",
    "we find to second order in the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath190 the interaction hamiltonian @xmath191 which can be rewritten as @xmath192    the kondo exchange interaction for the levels @xmath193 and thus for the orbital states @xmath194 can straightforwardly be read off this expression@xmath195 which leads to the interaction hamiltonian as defined in the main text .",
    "note that the potential scattering which changes the orbital index is of the same strength as the spin kondo scattering with an orbital change , @xmath196 . in lowest order , i.e.  involving two hopping processes",
    ", there is no transition between the hole and the particle state and we assume for the following @xmath197    furthermore we disregard a constant shift due to the following potential scattering contribution @xmath198 since it is negligible small at the particle - hole symmetric point @xmath38 , @xmath199 this constant offset in the current of order @xmath53 is neglected in our calculation .",
    "the green s functions for the orbital states @xmath91 are calculated by an expansion in the interaction hamiltonian @xmath200 the linear order does not contribute since it contains the expectation value of @xmath201 which is zero if the spin in the leads are not polarized . in the case of ferromagnetic leads this order has to be taken into account , but in our setup the leading order is second order in the coupling .",
    "we get contributions from the spin part of the interaction hamiltonian and of the potential scattering part .",
    "a mixing between both parts does not appear in second order due to the convolution of the leads contribution .",
    "for example the spin part is given by ( einstein s sum rule ) @xmath202 the conduction electron spins contract to @xmath203 since the leads are not magnetic , the conduction electron green s functions does not depend on spin and the sum over the spins acts only on the @xmath204-matrices and we can thus introduce the conduction electron spin susceptibility @xmath205 .    as discussed before there can in general be solutions with @xmath206 which we neglect in this setup  @xcite .",
    "the result for the diagonal greens s function yields finally the second order self energy by comparison with the dyson series : @xmath207           g_{b{\\sigma}'}(\\tau_1 , \\tau_2 )   \\\\ &    + \\sigma_{a{\\sigma}}^\\mathrm{el}(\\tau_1 , \\tau_2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inelastic and elastic potential scattering contributions are defined as @xmath208 note that in the rate equation @xmath209 does not contribute since it does not contain transitions between states ."
