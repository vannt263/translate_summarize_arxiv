    "this paper introduces a technique which we call _ reverse engineering _ that can be used to construct infinite families of distinct smooth structures on many @xmath0-manifolds . as one example of the utility of this technique we will construct infinitely many distinct smooth structures on @xmath1 .",
    "exotic smooth structures on these manifolds were first constructed in @xcite .",
    "reverse engineering is a three step process for constructing infinite families of distinct smooth structures on a given simply connected @xmath0-manifold .",
    "one starts with a model manifold which has nontrivial seiberg - witten invariant and the same euler number and signature as the simply connected manifold @xmath2 that one is trying to construct , but with @xmath3 .",
    "the second step is to find @xmath4 essential tori that carry generators of @xmath5 and to surger each of these tori in order to kill @xmath5 and , in favorable circumstances , to kill @xmath6 .",
    "the third step is to compute seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "after each of the first @xmath7 surgeries one needs to preserve the fact that the seiberg - witten invariant is nonzero .",
    "the fact that the next to last manifold in the string of surgeries has nontrivial seiberg - witten invariant allows the use of the morgan , mrowka , szab formula @xcite to produce an infinite family as was done in @xcite .    in many instances this procedure",
    "can be successfully applied without any computation , or even mention , of seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "if the model manifold for @xmath2 is symplectic and @xmath7 of the tori are lagrangian so that a luttinger surgery will reduce @xmath4 , then there are infinitely many distinct smooth manifolds with the same cohomology ring as @xmath2 . if the resulting manifold is simply connected , then one can often show that there are infinitely many distinct smooth structures on @xmath2 . aside from finding interesting model manifolds",
    ", it seems that the most difficult aspect to the reverse engineering procedure is the computation of fundamental groups .",
    "we will prove the main theorem that shows that this procedure provides infinitely many distinct manifolds in  2 .",
    "we then provide two examples . in ",
    "3 we apply the reverse engineering procedure to a model for @xmath1 , the @xmath8-fold symmetric product of a genus 3 surface .",
    "we will identify the lagrangian tori , show that the luttinger surgeries result in a simply connected manifold , and produce infinitely many distinct smooth structures on @xmath1 . in ",

    "one of the key questions in smooth @xmath0-manifold topology is whether a fixed homeomorphism type containing a smooth @xmath0-manifold must actually contain infinitely many diffeomorphism types .",
    "the idea of this section is to state and prove a general theorem pointing in this direction which may be useful to those who are constructing exotic @xmath0-manifolds .    to state our theorem",

    "one very useful application of the theorem is to start with a model manifold with @xmath3 and nontrivial seiberg - witten invariant and with the same euler number and signature as a ( say ) @xmath43 manifold that we are trying to construct .",
    "then , provided that we can find them , we surger essential tori which carry generators of @xmath5 .",
    "if we can do this @xmath44 times , we kill @xmath44 .",
    "we will see that if we can arrange the seiberg - witten invariant to be nonzero after each surgery , then we will satisfy the hypothesis that @xmath36 have nontrivial seiberg - witten invariant .",

    ", corollary  [ csw ] will tell us that the manifolds @xmath298 are pairwise nondiffeomorphic once we see that @xmath292 has exactly two basic classes .",
    "( the manifold denoted @xmath107 in corollary  [ csw ] is our manifold @xmath292 . ) note that @xmath299 is the result of performing the surgery @xmath300 in @xmath292 .",
    "( these are _ not _ luttinger surgeries . )",
    "[ inf ] the manifolds @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath112 , @xmath301 , are pairwise homeomorphic and ( except for @xmath1 ) are minimal , but no two are diffeomorphic .",
    "the homeomorphism statement will follow once we see that each @xmath112 is simply connected . a presentation for @xmath302",
    "is obtained from the one above for @xmath303 by replacing the relation @xmath304 $ ] by @xmath304^{-(n+1)}$ ] , and @xmath305 follows as above .",
    "next , we need to show that the manifold @xmath292 has just two basic classes , @xmath306 its canonical class , and then call on corollary  [ csw ] . since @xmath154 is a surface of general type , its only basic classes are @xmath306 its canonical class , i.e. @xmath307 , where @xmath167 and @xmath164 are the classes described above . according to @xcite , each time we do a surgery ,",
    "the seiberg - witten invariant of the result is calculated in terms of the seiberg - witten invariants of the original manifold and those of the result of the surgery that kills the curve on the torus .",
    "for example , if @xmath308 is the result of the surgery @xmath275 on @xmath154 , then let @xmath309 be the result of the surgery that kills @xmath182 directly ( @xmath141-surgery ) . in @xmath309 , the surface @xmath310 , which represents @xmath167 , has its genus reduced by one .",
    "applying the adjunction inequality to this situation , we see that any basic class of @xmath309 has the form @xmath311 .",
    "since the square of a basic class must be @xmath312 , in fact none of these classes can be basic ; so the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath309 vanishes .",
    "the result of this argument is that the manifold @xmath308 also has just two basic classes , @xmath306 its canonical class .",
    "the very same argument works for each surgery and finally shows that @xmath292 has just two basic classes .",
    "thus @xmath2 and @xmath112 have just two basic classes , @xmath313 , and the difference is a class of square @xmath314 . if one of these manifolds failed to be minimal , it would have to have a pair of basic classes , @xmath315 , whose difference has square @xmath316 .",
    "thus @xmath2 and @xmath112 are minimal .    in order to obtain infinitely many smooth structures",

    "we did this to explicitly show that all the @xmath112 are distinct .",
    "the hypothesis of corollary  [ swcor ] is satisfied because each of the lagrangian tori on which surgery is performed has a dual torus of square @xmath141 .",
    "each @xmath317 contains disjoint embeddings of a minimal genus @xmath318 surface representing @xmath167 and the three tori @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 with self - intersection @xmath165 .",
    "more interestingly , each @xmath317 contains a sphere of self - intersection @xmath322 representing @xmath323 -[t_{2 } ] -[t_{3}]$ ] that is the image in @xmath324 of a pushoff of the diagonal in @xmath147 .",
    "these surfaces can be useful for other constructions .",
    "the symmetric product @xmath325 of a genus @xmath326 surface with itself has @xmath327 and that @xmath328 , @xmath329 , and @xmath330 .",
    "thus @xmath331 is a model for @xmath332 .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the above application of reverse engineering provides infinitely many distinct smooth structures on these manifolds , one of which is symplectic .",
    "we now give an example to point out that the computation of fundamental groups in the reverse engineering procedure can be difficult .",
    "let @xmath333 , the product of two genus @xmath8 surfaces , and denote the standard generators of @xmath253 by @xmath334 and @xmath335 for @xmath208 .",
    "( since the calculations in this section parallel those of  3 , for the sake of simplicity we no longer denote the distinction between based and unbased loops . )",
