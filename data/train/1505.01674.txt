    "the latter condition was shown not to be a generic requirement ; chern insulator phases can be realized in mean field with only @xmath1 at the expense of enlarging the unit cell and doping the system.@xcite in addition , analogous topological phases have been obtained in other lattices such as the @xmath4flux model  @xcite and the kagome lattice.@xcite + the important question that still remains to be answered is whether the interaction induced chern state survives after the effect of quantum fluctuations is included .",

    "the cms phase was corroborated to survive quantum fluctuations in exact diagonalization  @xcite and within a variational monte carlo approach.@xcite the exact nature of the phase was further discussed in ref .   by computing the charge structure factor ; its suppressed fourier component at @xmath8 suggested the absence of charge imbalance between the sublattices and was therefore termed cm phase .",

    "[ fig : defs ] .",
    "we pick this geometry for the following two reasons .",
    "first , we have to keep in mind the structure of the reciprocal space .",
    "since we work in the thermodynamic limit in the @xmath32-direction along the cylinder , the momentum in @xmath32-direction is a continuous quantity .",
    "however in the finite @xmath33-direction around the cylinder , the momentum is a discrete variable . in the non - interacting case",
    ", the model forms a dirac semimetal and the fermi surface is located at the @xmath34 and @xmath35 points.@xcite in order to capture the low energy physics correctly , it is of key importance that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are allowed momenta in our unit cell which implies that only @xmath36 and @xmath30 are suitable circumferences of our cylinder .",
    "second , we have the freedom of fixing the length of our unit cell in the @xmath32-direction since the computational for that only scales linearly . by choosing three rings of 12 sites each",
    ", all orders are commensurate with our unit cell and a further enlargement would not lead to different results in the parameter region we investigated .",

    "we find six different phases : two new charge order phases labeled cdw  ii and cdw  iii and four previously reported mean field orders , the kekul , cms , cdw  i and semimetal phases .",
    "+ we have characterized each phase through their charge and bond ground state expectation values . at each site",
    "the charge expectation value is defined by @xmath39 the bond ground state expectation value on the other hand is defined as @xmath40 next we discuss the features of the different phases in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase diagram ] .",
    "we start by discussing the semimetal phase in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase diagram ] . at @xmath41 the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbor hopping its known to be described by a low energy theory in terms of two massless dirac fermions.@xcite short range interactions are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense  @xcite and",
    "therefore they can only drive a transition to an ordered state when they have a magnitude comparable to the nearest neighbor hopping strength @xmath42 .",
    "such perturbative analysis guarantees that the semimetal is stable within the region @xmath43 , only allowing for a uniform renormalization of the hopping strength @xmath42 by interactions .",

    "such asymmetry should up to a very small effect due to the cylinder geometry which is always present for finite @xmath47 vanish in a perfect semimetallic phase and indeed it is severely reduced as the bond dimension @xmath19 is increased .",
    "this suggests that the cylinder geometry implemented in idmrg artificially differentiates bonds in its two perpendicular directions .",
    "the asymmetry induced by the finite bond dimension vanishes as @xmath19 is increased and thus it is not a physical effect .",
    "this is consistent with a semimetal state ; the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires a matrix product state with @xmath48 . the bond asymmetry reduces the entanglement by shifting the dirac cones away from the @xmath34 and @xmath49 points.@xcite + together , the previous numerical evidence are consistent with the semimetallic state .",
    "we note that numerically the semimetal state extends beyond @xmath43 towards higher interaction strengths through a narrow semimetal trench in the phase diagram",
    ". the larger size of this region at @xmath50 ( not shown ) suggest that it is likely to shrink as the circumference of the cylinder is increased but a definitive statement requires going beyond the numerically accessible sizes .      upon increasing @xmath1",

    "indeed , it has been found in a mean field approximation,@xcite exact diagonalization,@xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations.@xcite      for small @xmath62 the ground state is classically degenerate . within mean field",
    "it was shown that as long as @xmath3 the system chooses a charge ordered pattern with charge modulation of wavevector @xmath34 or @xmath63 , termed the cms phase  @xcite and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : orders](c ) .",

    "the cms structure is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orders](c ) .",
    "it minimizes the large cost attributed to @xmath2 by reversing two nearest neighbor dimers at the expense of paying the small energetic cost determined by @xmath1 . within exact diagonalization",
    "it has been argued that the cms state survives quantum fluctuations.@xcite however , the sublattice charge imbalance predicted in mean field  @xcite was suggested to vanish in ref .   due to the absence of an enhanced fourier component of the charge structure factor at the @xmath8 point .",
    "we note that the cms scalar order parameter defined above quantifies the charge imbalance since @xmath70 has to be non - zero for it not to vanish .",
    "+ with the idmrg method we find that the cms appears directly above the semimetallic phase  [ see fig .",

    "the circles at each site have an area proportional to the strength of the charge at the given site , while the thickness of the links between the sites represent the bond strengths .",

    "moreover , we find a clear sublattice imbalance that grows as @xmath2 is increased that justifies the label cms rather than the simpler cm .",
    "we note also that the bond ordering of this phase is associated to the charge order : two neighboring sites with similar high ( or low ) charge densities that deviate from half - filling suppress the hopping between them due to the large ( small ) number of filled ( empty ) states at that site .",
    "+ we have also accounted for the existence of the cms state from a strong coupling perturbation theory analysis . by exactly diagonalizing the interaction part of @xmath74 in eq .   and",
    "then finding the first order hopping corrections @xmath75 in perturbation theory , we determined the ground state @xmath76 of a @xmath77 cluster .",
    "we then computed different scalar correlation functions of the charge order parameters , and found that only @xmath78|gs\\right>$ ] is finite .",
    "this confirms that in the strong coupling limit , the ground state is indeed of the cms form .",

    "we find that this state is stable in a finite but smaller region compared to both exact diagonalization and mean field .",
    "in contrast to the anisotropy found in the semimetal phase , the kekul order remains stable as the bond dimension @xmath19 is increased and stays finite upon extrapolation to infinite @xmath19 .",

    "+ although we can not attempt to fully answer this question some light can be shed through our idmrg numerical data .",

    "[ fig : phase diagram](c ) while the other six correspond to those states with defect lines determined by rotated hexagons , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasediagram ] e. the second is the cdw  i state , where the two states have a single sublattice ( a or b ) fully occupied .",
    "the energy per site of these states is given by @xmath158 + in the case of the cdw  iii cluster , for generic values of @xmath157 we find two possible classical ground states with degeneracies 2 and 2 .",
    "the first correspond to the stripe - like phase mentioned before , which is also commensurate with this cluster , and is therefore assigned the label cdw  ii .",
    "the second corresponds to cdw  i. the energies per site remain the same as those in eqs .",
    "[ cdwii]-[cdwi ] .",
    "in addition , in this cluster there is another classical state with degeneracy 18 and energy @xmath159 which requires consideration .",
    "this energy is always higher than @xmath160 or @xmath161 , except at the special point @xmath162 where the three cross , @xmath163 .",
    "the reason why this state must be considered is that quantum corrections split it to first order in @xmath42 , thus lowering its energy .",
    "since neither cdw  ii or cdw  i is affected by @xmath42 to first order , there is a small region around @xmath162 where the energy of this state is lowest .",

    "the projection of @xmath136 into these classical ground states is finite only for the first two , and the pattern of degeneracies at low energies becomes @xmath166 for both .",
    "this low energy pattern is the same as the one that is obtained for the cms phase in exact diagonalization , @xcite pointing to the fact that these two states represent the cms phase ( further evidence to support this claim is also shown below . ) .",
    "the third state is an intermediate state with the same energy as the cdw  iii classical states , but which is not corrected by quantum fluctuations at any @xmath157 .",
    "the fourth is again the cdw  i. the energies per site of the three phases in the @xmath77 cluster are given by @xmath167 as explained in the main text , the energy per site of the cdw  ii phase @xmath160 is lower than the classical energies of any state of the @xmath77 cluster .",
    "since the intermediate state does not have quantum corrections , its energy satisfies @xmath168 and it is never realized .",
