    "in the past few decades the study of exotic few body systems has been focused on light fragile systems like halo nuclei . with increasing experimental sophistication , one has now extended this study to the medium mass region where long held concepts in nuclear physics - like that of magic numbers appear to breakdown in some neutron rich nuclei away from the  valley of stability \" .",

    "our calculations , therefore , could also serve as a motivation for future experiments with exotic nuclei in the deformed medium - mass region of the nuclear chart .    in retrospect , one can argue that for a more universal application of our theory , relativistic effects need to be taken into consideration , especially at very high beam energies .",
    "however , a fully relativistic breakup reaction theory , including proper relativistic dynamics , is still a long way off .",
    "initial efforts in this direction involving a modified klein - gordon equation has already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the relativistic corrections to the breakup of @xmath152b on pb were studied at various beam energies . in fact , for beam energies from @xmath153 mev / u , these corrections were shown to be in the range of @xmath154 .",
    "similar effects were also predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite where breakup of @xmath152b and @xmath145be on pb were studied at @xmath153 mev / u , using a continuum - discretized coupled - channels method with eikonal approximation .",
    "interestingly , they also found that the effects of relativistic corrections to the nuclear potentials , in their study , were not significant .    qualitatively therefore , a similar range as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite can be attributed to relativistic effects , in the case of @xmath0ne breaking up on heavy targets . however , unless large systematic and statistical uncertainties are reduced in many experiments it may not be possible to positively discern these effects .",
    "nevertheless , efforts towards a fully relativistic theory will be a very welcome step in confronting data due to emanate from new generation of radioactive ion beam facilities being operated in various parts of the world .",
