    "the standard model of cosmology is confronted with several unpalatable coincidences , suggesting that we do not yet have a fully consistent picture of the universe s dynamical expansion ( see , e.g. , melia & shevchuk 2011 ) .",
    "part of the problem is that cosmological observations can only be interpreted from within the context of a pre - assumed model , and the data can be quite compliant .",
    "the @xmath9cdm ( cold dark matter with a cosmological constant @xmath9 ) model has been without peer in cosmology ( see , e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 , and tegmark et al . 2004 ) . for example , this model has been used with complementary measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation to determine that the universe is flat , so its energy density @xmath12 is at ( or very near ) the  critical \" density @xmath13 .",
    "but among the many peculiarities of this description of the universe is the inference , based on current observations , that the density @xmath14 of dark energy must itself be of order @xmath15 .",
    "( in the context of @xmath9cdm , the best fit to the wmap data indicates that dark energy represents approximately @xmath16 of the total @xmath17 ; see spergel et al .",
    "dark energy is often thought to be the manifestation of the aforementioned cosmological constant , @xmath9 , though no reasonable explanation has yet been offered as to why such a fixed , universal density ought to exist at this scale .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath9 is associated with the energy of the vacuum in quantum theory , it should have a scale representative of phase transitions in the early universe120 orders of magnitude greater than @xmath15 .",
    "many workers have attempted to circumvent these difficulties by proposing alternative forms of dark energy , including quintessence ( ratra & peebles 1988 ; wetterich 1988 ) , which represents an evolving canonical scalar field with an inflation - inducing potential , a chameleon field ( see , e.g. , mota & barrow 2004 ; khoury & weltman 2004 ; brax et al .",
    "2004 ) in which the scalar field couples to the baryon energy density and varies from solar system to cosmological scales , and modified gravity , arising out of both string motivated , or general relativity modified actions ( capozziello et al . 2003 ; nojiri & odintsov 2003 ; carroll et al .",
    "2004 ) , which introduce large length scale corrections modifying the late time evolution of the universe .",
    "the actual number of suggested remedies is far greater than this small , illustrative sample .",
    "an equally perplexing puzzle with @xmath9cdm has been dubbed the  coincidence problem , \" arising from the peculiar near - simultaneous convergence of the matter energy density @xmath18 and @xmath14 towards @xmath15 in the present epoch .",
    "though @xmath18 and @xmath14 are expected to change at different rates as the universe expands ( particularly if dark energy is a cosmological constant ) they are nearly equal in the present epoch , implying that we live at a special time in cosmic history .    in a recent paper ( melia & shevchuk 2011 ) , we proposed an explanation for yet another disturbing coincidence , having to do with the apparent equality of our gravitational ( or hubble ) radius @xmath4 with the distance @xmath19 light could have traveled since the big bang ( in terms of the presumed current age @xmath20 of the universe ) .",
    "this equality has received some scrutiny in recent years ( melia 2003 , 2007 , 2009 , melia & abdelqader 2009 , van oirschot et al .",
    "2010 ; see also lima 2007 for a related , though unpublished , work ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is still some confusion regarding the properties of @xmath4 due to a misunderstanding of the role it plays in our observations .",
    "for example , it is sometimes suggested ( see , e.g. , davis & lineweaver 2004 ; van oirschot et al .",
    "2010 ) that sources beyond @xmath10 are observable today , which is certainly not the case .",
    "we will therefore begin by elaborating upon what the gravitational radius @xmath4 is  and what it is not . though first defined in melia ( 2007 ) , an unrecognized form of @xmath4 actually appeared in de sitter s ( 1917 ) own account of his spacetime metric . and",
    "we will advance the discussion further by actually calculating photon trajectories for various well - studied friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies , demonstrating that the null geodesics reaching us at @xmath20 have never crossed @xmath10 .",
    "some come close , and in one case  the de sitter model ",
    "they approach @xmath4 asymptotically as @xmath21 recedes to our infinite past .",
    "our conclusion in this paper will be that @xmath10 is a real limit to our observability at the present time @xmath20 .",
    "standard cosmology is based on the robertson - walker metric for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic three - dimensional space . in terms of the proper time @xmath21 measured by a comoving observer , and the corresponding radial ( @xmath22 ) and",
    "angular coordinates ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) in the comoving frame , an interval @xmath25 in this metric is written as @xmath26\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the expansion factor and the constant @xmath28 is @xmath29 for a closed universe , @xmath30 for a flat , open universe , or @xmath31 for an open universe .    in recent work ( melia 2007 , 2009 ; melia & abdelqader 2009 ) , we demonstrated the usefulness of examining properties of the metric in terms of both co - moving coordinates @xmath32 and observer - dependent coordinates @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the so - called proper radius @xmath35 . whereas @xmath32 describe events in a frame `` falling '' freely with the cosmic expansion , the second set of coordinates are referenced to a particular individual who describes the spacetime relative to the origin at his location .    for a flat universe ( @xmath36 ) , it is straightforward to show that with this definition of @xmath34 , equation  ( 1 ) becomes @xmath37 ^ 2 - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath38 signals the dependence of the metric on the proximity of the observation radius @xmath34 to the gravitational radius @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in melia & abdelqader ( 2009 ) , the exact form of @xmath4 depends on the constituents of the universe .",
    "for example , in de sitter space ( which contains only a cosmological constant @xmath9 ) , @xmath39 , in terms of the ( time - invariant ) hubble constant @xmath40 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath41 in a radiation - dominated universe and @xmath42 when the universe contains only ( visible and dark ) matter .",
    "quite generally , @xmath4 is the radius at which a proper sphere encloses sufficient mass - energy to turn it into a schwarzschild surface for an observer at the origin of the coordinates ( see melia & shevchuk 2011 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath43 is given in all cases by the expression @xmath44 where @xmath45 , in terms of the total energy density @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 which , for a flat universe , may also be written more simply as @xmath47 .    although not defined in this fashion , the hubble radius @xmath48 ( more commonly encountered when co - moving coordinates are used ) is therefore seen to coincide with the gravitational radius @xmath4 emerging directly from the robertson - walker metric written in terms of @xmath34 . what this means , of course , is that the hubble radius is not a mere empirical artifact of the expanding universe , but actually represents the radius at which a sphere centered on the observer contains sufficient mass - energy for its surface to function as a _",
    "static _ horizon .",
    "of course , that also means that the speed of expansion a distance @xmath4 away from us must be equal to @xmath5 , just as the speed of matter falling into a compact object reaches @xmath5 at the black hole s horizon ( and this is in fact the criterion used to define the hubble radius in the first place ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath4 is an essential ingredient of the metric written in the form of equation  ( 2 ) can be understood in the context of the birkhoff ( 1923 ) theorem and its corollary ( see melia 2007 ) .",
    "the latter states that the metric inside an empty spherical cavity , at the center of a spherically symmetric system , must be equivalent to the flat - space minkowski metric .",
    "space must be flat in a spherical cavity even if the system is infinite .",
    "thus , the metric between the edge of a cavity and a spherically symmetric mass placed at its center is necessarily of the schwarzschild type .",
    "the worldlines linked to an observer in this region are curved relative to the center of the cavity in a manner determined solely by the mass we have placed there .",
    "the implication is that any two points within a medium with non - zero @xmath12 experience a net acceleration ( or deceleration ) toward ( or away ) from each other , determined solely by how much mass - energy is contained between them .",
    "this is why , of course , the universe can not be static , a concept that eluded einstein himself , since his thinking on this subject preceded that of birkhoff .",
    "yet the physical meaning of @xmath4 is still elusive to many , possibly because of the widely held belief that all horizons must necessarily be asymptotic surfaces attained when @xmath49 .",
    "the so - called event horizon ( see rindler 1956 ) is indeed of this type , representing the ultimate limit of our observability to the end of time .",
    "however , @xmath4 is not in this category  nor should it be . unlike the event horizon ,",
    "the gravitational radius is a time - dependent quantity that increases in value at a rate determined by the evolving constituents of the universe , specifically , the value of the equation - of - state parameter @xmath50 , defined by the relation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the pressure and @xmath12 is the energy density . for some cosmologies ,",
    "@xmath4 may turn into the event horizon when the cosmic time approaches infinity .",
    "note from the definition of @xmath4 that @xmath53 , so with equation  ( 4 ) @xmath54 clearly , @xmath4 is constant only for the de sitter metric , where @xmath55 and therefore @xmath56 . for all other values of @xmath57 ,",
    "so in @xmath9cdm , for example , where the universe is currently dominated by a blend of matter and dark energy , @xmath58 .",
    "if dark energy were a cosmological constant , however , the universe would eventually become de sitter as the density of matter drops to zero , and we would therefore expect @xmath4 to then asymptotically approach a constant value equal to the radius of the event horizon in @xmath9cdm .    what this means , then , is that the current location of @xmath4 affects what we can observe right now , at time @xmath20 since the big bang ; it is not  and is not meant to be  an indication of",
    "how far we will see in our future",
    ". one must therefore be careful interpreting spacetime diagrams , such as figure  3 in van oirschot et al .",
    "consider that for an einstein - de sitter universe ( with @xmath59 , the value used to construct this figure ) , @xmath60 so our observations never encounter @xmath4 because no matter how far light travels , it never overtakes @xmath4 .",
    "but that does nt mean that this must always be the case .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 for any cosmology with @xmath62which is presumably the situation with @xmath9cdm .",
    "one of the principal goals of this paper is to calculate the actual photon trajectories for well - known frw cosmologies , such as @xmath9cdm , in order to demonstrate how and why @xmath4 functions as a limit to our observability today ( at time @xmath20 ) .",
    "let us now derive the equation describing photon trajectories in a cosmology consistent with the frw metric ( equation  1 ) . from the definition of proper radius , we see that @xmath63 but the null condition for geodesics ( see , e.g. , ellis & rothman 1993 ) applied to equation  ( 1 ) yields @xmath64 where we have assumed propagation of the photon towards the origin along a radius .",
    "the best indications we have today are that the universe is flat so , for simplicity , we will assume @xmath36 in all the calculations described below , and therefore ( for a photon approaching us ) @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we can write equation  ( 6 ) as follows : @xmath66 where we have added a subscript @xmath67 to emphasize the fact that this represents the proper radius of a photon propagating towards us .",
    "note that in this expression , both @xmath68 and @xmath4 are functions of cosmic time @xmath21 . the gravitational radius must therefore be calculated according to equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "the analysis of the wmap data , within the context of the standard model , points to an age for the universe of @xmath69 billion years .",
    "but we also know @xmath12 quite accurately now , and we can use it to calculate @xmath10 , which appears to be approximately @xmath2 billion light - years , equal to @xmath19 within the measurement errors . this is the unlikely coincidence we alluded to in the introduction , because there clearly is no particular reason why @xmath70 in equation  ( 5 ) should be equal to @xmath5 , especially if @xmath50 changes with time .",
    "the implausibility of this equality and its possible interpretation have been discussed elsewhere ( e.g. , melia & shevchuk 2011 ) , so we will not dwell on them here .",
    "however , we will use the inferred value of @xmath4 today as one of our boundary conditions . in principle ,",
    "equation  ( 8) may be integrated either forwards or backwards , but in reality , we are more familiar with the physical conditions now , at time @xmath20 , so it makes practical sense to begin the solution of this equation at @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    not surprisingly , @xmath74 equals @xmath75 today , since this must represent the actual speed of light measured in our local frame at the origin of our coordinates .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath74 differs from @xmath75 away from the observer .",
    "this type of phenomenon often gives rise to misinterpretation and confusion , stemming from the fact that many consider @xmath34 to be the actual physical distance measured by a single observer , and that @xmath76 is therefore the physical speed .",
    "but in general relativity , the proper velocity measured by an individual is actually @xmath77 , calculated in terms of the proper distance @xmath34 and proper time @xmath78 in his / her frame , where the metric coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 are independent of @xmath78 .",
    "light satisfies the null condition @xmath81 , and therefore @xmath82 is _ always _ equal to @xmath5 , regardless of whether the frame of reference is inertial or not . written in terms of the co - moving coordinates ,",
    "the metric in equation  ( 1 ) does not satisfy these conditions , and so @xmath83 is generally not equal to @xmath5 .",
    "this happens because @xmath21 only represents the physical time on the clock at the observer s location ( in other words , @xmath84 only at @xmath85 ) .",
    "if this observer were to measure @xmath78 at any other position , ( s)he would infer a value different from the local proper time @xmath21 at that radius . and because @xmath21 is used as a common time everywhere , the quantity @xmath86 at best represents the sum of all the incremental segments measured by a collaboration of observers  each at time @xmath21 in their own rest frame  stretched out from one spacetime point to another ( see , e.g. , weinberg 1972 ) . thus , although @xmath86 is the  proper \" distance defined in terms of the cosmic time @xmath21 , it actually does not represent the physical distance between these two points for an individual observer whose time coordinate is @xmath78 in his / her frame .",
    "a better description for @xmath34 would be that it represents a  community \" distance between two spacetime points and , as a result , @xmath74 is not constrained to have the value @xmath75 away from the origin .    in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the solutions to equation  ( 8) for various assumed cosmologies , including @xmath9cdm , the current standard model .",
    "the de sitter universe has no ordinary matter or radiation .",
    "its dynamics is dictated solely by a cosmological constant @xmath9 , which results in an expansion factor @xmath87 . as we noted earlier ( following equation  3 ) , the gravitational horizon for this spacetime is constant @xmath39 and @xmath55 . by design ,",
    "the energy density @xmath12 is also constant . a plot of @xmath68 , in units of @xmath10 ,",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath88 in figure  1 . in de sitter , the maximum proper distance of photons reaching us today was @xmath89 , which occurred at cosmic time @xmath90 .",
    "never along its geodesic path did light s proper distance from us exceed our gravitational horizon today .",
    ", as a function of cosmic time , @xmath21 , for de sitter space .",
    "the proper radius is expressed in units of the current gravitational radius @xmath10 , and @xmath21 is measured as a fraction of the hubble time @xmath20 . ]        this feature is echoed by the einstein - de sitter universe , which consists entirely of matter .",
    "the cosmological constant and radiation are both absent , so @xmath59 . in this case",
    ", the scale factor grows as @xmath91 ( see , e.g. , melia & abdelqader 2009 ) , so the density is infinite at @xmath90 and decreases monotonically as @xmath92 .",
    "the gravitational radius ( @xmath93 ) grows linearly with time , but is always greater than @xmath94 .",
    "the null geodesic for this cosmology is shown in figure  2 , where we see that @xmath68 attains its maximum value @xmath6@xmath95 about 2.6 gyr after the big bang .    when the universal expansion is driven solely by radiation , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the expansion factor is then given by @xmath98 , and the corresponding null geodesic is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the proper distance @xmath68 of light attains its maximum value of @xmath6@xmath99 at @xmath100 .     and @xmath97 .",
    "]    for a universe dominated by a combination of matter and radiation , the expansion factor also grows monotonically with cosmic time @xmath21 , though the value of @xmath50 falls sharply from about @xmath101 in the early universe ( where radiation dominates ) and tapers off towards zero as we approach the present time , where the effect of radiation is relatively insignificant .",
    "the photon geodesic for this case is shown in figure  4 , where we see it attaining its maximum proper distance from us , @xmath6@xmath95 , roughly 3 gyr after the big bang .",
    "as with the other cases we ve considered , the photon s trajectory never takes it beyond our current gravitational horizon @xmath10 .            in @xmath9cdm , the standard model of cosmology , the density @xmath12 is comprised of three principal components , @xmath102 where ,",
    "following convention , we designate the matter , radiation , and dark energy densities , respectively , as @xmath18 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "we will also assume that these energy densities scale according to @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "( if dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant @xmath9 , which we assume for this calculation , then @xmath108 constant . ) in this case , there is no simple analytical solution for @xmath50 and @xmath109 , so these are calculated numerically , along with @xmath110 . for completeness , we show the expansion factor @xmath27 as a function of cosmic time in figure  5a ; the value of @xmath50 , averaged over time from @xmath30 to @xmath21 , is shown as a function of cosmic time in figure  5b ; the gravitational radius @xmath4 is shown as a function of @xmath21 in figure  5c ; and the null geodesic itself is plotted in figure  5d .",
    "the blending of three different components in @xmath12 produces some discernible differences in the behavior of @xmath68 compared to the cases we considered previously , but even here , its maximum value was a fraction @xmath6@xmath111 of today s gravitational radius @xmath10 at roughly @xmath112 after the big bang .                in all these cases ,",
    "we have demonstrated through direct computation that null geodesics have never traversed the current gravitational ( or hubble ) radius , regardless of what specific cosmology one assumes . in order for light to reach us today , its source radiating at cosmic time @xmath113 must have been located a proper distance @xmath114 away , corresponding to one of the trajectories shown in figures  1,2,3,4 , or 5d . in other words ,",
    "none of the sources whose light we detect today could have been more distant than ( in most cases , actually only a fraction @xmath60.30.4 of ) our current gravitational horizon @xmath10 .    in spite of this",
    ", it is sometimes claimed ( see , e.g. , van oirschot , kwan and lewis 2010 ) that we see sources from beyond the hubble radius because its redshift is only @xmath6@xmath7 , much smaller than sources such as the recombination region that produced the cmb ( at a redshift of @xmath6@xmath8 in the standard model ) .",
    "this misconception arises because  written as a proper distance ( see melia & shevchuk 2011)@xmath4 is expressed as @xmath115 where the comoving radius may further be written in the form @xmath116 so , for example , if we crudely assume that the universe s expansion has been driven by a matter - dominated @xmath12 , for which @xmath117 , we find that @xmath118 and using the observation that @xmath119 ( melia & shevchuk 2011 ) , with @xmath120 ( see , e.g. , weinberg 1972 ) , one easily  finds \" a redshift @xmath121@xmath6@xmath122 for the hubble sphere ( the value is closer to @xmath7 when using the actual form of @xmath27 from @xmath9cdm ) .",
    "the apparent conflict between this inference and the curves shown in figures  1,2,3,4 , and 5d , arises from an incorrect interpretation of @xmath109 as a null geodesic , which it is not . in other words , the comoving radius @xmath123 in equation  ( 11 ) , and therefore the proper radius @xmath4 ,",
    "do not track the propagation of light through the hubble flow .",
    "only equation  ( 8) for @xmath110 can do this because it includes both the effects of an expanding medium and the change in comoving radius @xmath22 as light approaches us .",
    "instead , @xmath10 represents today s proper distance to sources that in the past radiated the light we see at @xmath20 redshifted by an amount @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , to correctly determine their proper distance at the time the light was produced , one needs to calculate @xmath124 , not @xmath10 , where @xmath113 is the cosmic time corresponding to redshift @xmath121 .",
    "clearly , @xmath121 is that special redshift for which @xmath125 , and there is therefore no conflict between the finite value of @xmath121 and the fact that @xmath10 is the limit to our observability today .",
    "throughout this paper , we have made a conscious effort to discuss the properties of null geodesics in frw cosmologies without resorting to conformal diagrams .",
    "this approach , also used to great effect by ellis and rothman ( 1993 ) , makes it easier to think in terms of familiar quantities ( proper distances and proper time ) that are not always straightforward to interpret otherwise .",
    "misconceptions often arise from the misinterpretation of coordinate - dependent effects . in their paper , ellis and rothman",
    "clearly delineated true horizons from apparent horizons , and extended the definitions , first introduced by rindler ( 1956 ) , in a clear and pedagogical manner . in this paper , we have paid particular attention to the gravitational horizon , also manifested as the hubble radius , which is time - dependent and may or may not turn into an event horizon in the asymptotic future , depending on the equation of state .",
    "it is useful at this point to be absolutely clear about how far light has traveled in reaching us .",
    "it is quite evident from our results that sources whose light we see today were at a proper distance @xmath126 when @xmath127 . for the frw cosmologies we have considered here ( which include @xmath9cdm ) the light reaching us today  including that from the recombination region associated with the cmb  has traveled a _",
    "net _ proper distance of at most @xmath60.3@xmath128 .",
    "it is therefore not correct to claim that the size of the visible universe in these cosmologies is @xmath19 ( or even greater in some interpretations ) . because all causally connected sources in an expanding universe began in a vanishingly small volume as @xmath129 , the maximum proper distance from which we receive light today",
    "must necessarily be less than @xmath19 , since presumably there were no pre - existing sources at a non - zero proper distance prior to @xmath90 with which we were in causal contact .",
    "it is true , however , that more and more sources become visible to us as time advances , since for @xmath130 , the geodesic curves terminating in our future all rise above their current counterparts shown in figures  1,2,3,4 , and 5d . in our future",
    ", we will see light from sources that radiated at proper distances greater than those shown here .",
    "of course , @xmath109 will also continue to increase , and it is not difficult to convince oneself from equations  ( 5 ) and ( 8) that the limits of observability will always be @xmath109 , since @xmath131 is smaller than @xmath132 for all @xmath133 . to see this ,",
    "let us first find the emission time @xmath134 at which @xmath135 attains its maximum value .",
    "clearly , this happens when @xmath136 , which means that @xmath137 .",
