    "most of the recent progress in ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy has been obtained from atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( act ) using the imaging technique , which permits efficient rejection of the large background of proton or nucleus - induced showers .",
    "the utility of high - definition imaging has been demonstrated by the results obtained with the whipple ( 109 pixels ) @xcite , cangaroo ( 220 pixels ) @xcite , and hegra ( 271 pixels ) @xcite act s , leading to the discovery of several firmly established very - high - energy sources ; e.g. , the crab nebula @xcite , the pulsar psr 1706 - 44 @xcite , and the two relatively nearby active galactic nuclei , markarian 421 @xcite and markarian 501 @xcite . using a camera with a large number of small pixels allows a more profound image analysis than the usual procedure based on the first and second moments of the light distribution @xcite , with improved background rejection and energy resolution .",
    "the new image analysis described here takes advantage of the full imaging information , including the detailed longitudinal development of the shower ( with a significant asymmetry between the top and the bottom of the shower ) as well as its lateral extension .",
    "this method is based on an analytical model giving , for a genuine @xmath0-ray shower , the average distribution of cherenkov light in the focal plane as a function of the following parameters : @xmath0-ray energy @xmath1 , distance @xmath2 between the shower axis and the telescope ( or impact parameter ) , the source position ( defined by the vector @xmath3 in the focal plane ) , and the azimuthal position @xmath4 of the shower image about the source in the focal plane .",
    "this model is used to define a @xmath5-like function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . for each observed shower , this function is minimized with respect to the parameters : the minimized @xmath5 provides gamma - hadron discrimination ; the @xmath0-ray energy determination automatically takes account of the impact parameter which is obtained from the same fit . with this method",
    ", the origin of a genuine @xmath0-ray shower can be reconstructed even with one single telescope .",
    "this result stems from the fact that electromagnetic showers whose energies are known have a well - defined longitudinal development with rather small fluctuations . in the focal plane of an imaging act",
    ", this gives a well - defined longitudinal profile for the image , which depends on the impact parameter and angular origin of the shower .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the preceding fit also yields the source position @xmath3 . for the case of a well - localized point source",
    ", the energy resolution can be improved by fixing the source position during the fit since there are fewer parameters in the fit .    in this article , the preceding method is illustrated as applied to the cat imaging telescope @xcite , operating since autumn 1996 in the french pyrenees .",
    "its very - high - definition imaging camera comprises a central region consisting of 546 phototubes in a hexagonal matrix spaced by 0.13@xmath6 ; this is surrounded by 54 tubes in two `` guard rings '' .",
    "the angular diameter of the full field of view is @xmath7 ( @xmath8 for the small pixels ) .",
    "the guard rings were installed in june 1997 , so for the data and simulations used here , they are not included .",
    "a more complete description of the cat imaging telescope can be found in @xcite .",
    "the detector response has been simulated in detail , thus allowing the optimization of the new image analysis on the basis of monte - carlo - generated @xmath0-showers against the background of real off - source data .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the full simulation of the instrument , allowing the calculation of the variation of the equivalent detection area as a function of @xmath1 for different zenith angles , thus defining the corresponding energy thresholds . in section 3 ,",
    "the semi - analytical model giving the average cherenkov light distribution in the focal plane for a @xmath0-ray shower is described in detail and shown to be consistent with results from complete simulations of electromagnetic cascades . in section 4 , the performance of the analysis method is presented for different values of the zenith angle ; the discussion is focused on hadron rejection by a single cut on the image shape ( and for a known point source , an additional cut on direction ) , on the accuracy of the source location , and finally on energy resolution .",
    "the development of electromagnetic or hadronic air showers in the atmosphere is simulated by a modified version of the program described in @xcite . for each event ,",
    "the cherenkov photons falling onto the mirror elements are followed individually according to their arrival times , initial directions , and wavelengths ; reflection from the davies - cotton mirror is calculated , taking into account imperfections of the mirrors shapes and orientations .",
    "typical aberration images from a point source are smaller than or comparable to the pixel size .",
    "a wavelength - dependent fraction of photons is kept , reproducing the effect of mirror reflectivity and winston cones efficiency @xcite as well as phototubes quantum efficiency .",
    "photons from the sky - noise are also simulated , taking into account the effect of ac coupling on the read - out electronics .",
    "the contribution of typical star fields may be superposed .",
    "the time - structure and amplitude fluctuation of the pulses generated by single @xmath0e s have been parametrized on the basis of tests with the cat electronics .",
    "the signal from a given pixel is obtained from the pile - up of the contributions from individual @xmath0e s according to their respective arrival times , taking account of the amplitude fluctuation of @xmath9e .",
    "the comparator threshold is set at a level corresponding to three times the height of the average single-@xmath0e signal .",
    "when a trigger occurs , the phototube signal ( corrected for the effect of propagation along the @xmath10 cable ) is integrated over the @xmath11 time window provided by the fast gate , thus yielding the simulated adc output .",
    "these adc outputs are then used as input to the analysis procedure described in the following sections .",
    "the preceding simulation of instrumental effects allows the calculation of the equivalent detection area for @xmath0-rays as a function of energy for a given zenith angle @xmath12 .",

    "[ fig : images].a ) , patterns from hadron showers are often more chaotic or patchy due to the superposition of several electromagnetic components due to @xmath24 s ( fig .",

    "[ fig : images].d ) . for hadron showers with energies lower than @xmath26 ,",
    "often the only component which is seen is the cherenkov light from a single muon ; such muons are a source of background in the case where the image is reduced to a short arc , which mimics a low - energy @xmath0-ray shower @xcite",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the cat imaging telescope is surrounded by the seven detectors of the asgat timing array @xcite ( whose collectors are @xmath27 diameter each ) which should permit the rejection of most of these background events when it resumes operation after upgrade , in 1998 .",
    "for a given value of energy @xmath1 and impact parameter , @xmath2 , the cherenkov image of an electromagnetic shower fluctuates about the mean image , as a result both of intrinsic fluctuations of the shower and of statistical effects in the cherenkov light collection , as well as instrumental fluctuations . an analysis based on the comparison between individual event images and the theoretical mean image as a function of impact parameter and energy allows full advantage to be taken of the high definition of the cat imaging telescope camera .",
    "such an analysis requires an analytical model for @xmath0-shower cherenkov images .    in order to construct this model ,",
    "we have used the results from a paper by hillas @xcite in which the mean development of electromagnetic showers is described and parametrized on the basis of monte - carlo simulations .",

    "their energy spectrum and the angular distribution of their momenta with respect to the shower axis are given .",
    "their spatial distribution around the shower axis is not explicitly stated , but parametrizations of their mean distance from this axis and of their spreads in the radial and azimuthal directions are given as a function of their energy and momentum angle .",
    "these parametrizations have been compared with our monte - carlo simulations , and were found to be in very good agreement , except for the mean value of the angular distribution which we have modified slightly ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "this description of the mean shower development permits the mean cherenkov image to be deduced , with the additional use of the atmospheric density profile as in @xcite , optical absorption as in @xcite , cherenkov emission properties , and some of the detector characteristics such as its light - collecting area , photo - tube quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength , and site altitude .",
    "the angular distance from the source to the zenith has also to be taken into account .    in practice",
    ", the shower ( for a given energy and impact parameter ) is divided into `` slices '' perpendicular to its axis at different depths , and the contribution of each slice to the image is calculated .",
    "in such a slice , the contribution of a charged particle ( @xmath28 ) with a given energy and direction and a given lateral position with respect to the shower axis is evaluated as follows : the corresponding cone of cherenkov emission traces a circle on the plane perpendicular to the shower axis containing the imaging telescope ; rather than considering a mirror with a fixed position with respect to the shower , we allow it to rotate around the shower axis ( the distance @xmath2 is fixed ) and use the intersection of the corresponding ring with the circle of cherenkov light to find the average contribution of these @xmath28 s to the image as well as the position of the photo - electrons in the focal plane ( see appendix  2 and fig .  [",
    "fig : calc ] ) . summing over the energy , direction , and averaging over the lateral position of all @xmath28 s in the slice",
    "gives the mean position of its image in the focal plane , its mean transverse extension , and the corresponding density of @xmath0e s .",
    "the sum of the contributions of all the slices gives a full mean image description in terms of the linear density of light along the image axis and the transverse extension of the image as a function of position along this axis .",
    "the form of the transverse profile is taken to be a constant shape , determined from monte - carlo simulations .",
    "this form is scaled to the calculated transverse extension , which varies with position along the image axis .",

    "a function @xmath31 is then defined in such a way that its minimization with respect to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 gives the values of those parameters which best fit the model to the image .",

    "<S> a new method of shower - image analysis is presented which appears very powerful as applied to those cherenkov imaging telescopes with very high definition imaging capability . </S>",
    "<S> it provides hadron rejection on the basis of a single cut on the image shape , and simultaneously determines the energy of the electromagnetic shower and the position of the shower axis with respect to the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the source location is also reconstructed for each individual @xmath0-ray shower , even with one single telescope , so for a point source the hadron rejection can be further improved . as an example , this new method is applied to data from the cat ( cherenkov array at thmis ) imaging telescope , which has been operational since autumn , 1996 .    gamma - ray astronomy , atmospheric cherenkov detector </S>"
