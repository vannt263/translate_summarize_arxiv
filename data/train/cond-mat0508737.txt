    "sampling and counting graph colorings is a fundamental problem in computer science and discrete mathematics .",
    "it is also of fundamental interest in statistical physics : graph colorings correspond to the zero - temperature case of the _ antiferromagnetic potts model _ , a model of magnetism",
    "on which physicists have performed extensive numerical experiments ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "physicists wish to estimate quantities such as spatial correlations and magnetization , and to do this they sample random states using markov chains .",
    "this is a general technique whereby one starts with an arbitrary state , and then repeatedly modifies it using a random rule .",
    "for the zero - temperature potts model , two standard such rules described below are glauber dynamics and kempe chain flips , also known as the wang - swendsen - koteck algorithm . while these algorithms often appear to work well in practice , we would like to know that their _ mixing time_i.e .",
    ", the time it takes them to achieve a nearly - uniform distribution on the set of states  is polynomially bounded as a function of the size of the lattice . establishing this",
    "rigorously has been a major project in mathematical physics and theoretical computer science ; see for example  @xcite .    moreover ,",
    "_ optimal temporal mixing , _",
    "i.e. , a mixing time of @xmath1 , is deeply related to the physical properties of the system  @xcite . in particular , under certain conditions on the markov chain , it implies _ spatial mixing _ ,",
    "i.e. , the exponential decay of correlations , and thus the existence of a finite correlation length and the uniqueness of the gibbs measure . therefore , optimal mixing of natural markov chains for @xmath0-colorings of the square lattice is considered a major open problem in physics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "physicists have conjectured  @xcite that the @xmath0-state potts model has spatial mixing for @xmath2 , even at zero temperature .",
    "as we discuss below , previous results  @xcite have established this rigorously for @xmath3 .",
    "our main result is that the square lattice has strong spatial mixing for @xmath4 , and in particular that a natural markov chain has optimal temporal mixing .",
    "we consider the so - called _ block heat - bath dynamics _ , which we call @xmath5 . at each step , for fixed integers @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "we choose an @xmath8 block @xmath9 of the lattice @xmath10 , uniformly at random from among all such blocks contained in @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the set of @xmath0-colorings of @xmath9 which are consistent with the coloring of @xmath12 .",
    "we choose a uniformly random coloring @xmath13 and recolor @xmath9 with @xmath14 .",
    "our main theorem is :    [ t1 ] @xmath15 on 6-colorings of the square lattice mixes in @xmath1 time .",
    "we prove theorem  [ t1 ] for finite rectangular regions with free , fixed , or toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "our method is similar to that of  @xcite in that it consists of a computer - assisted proof of the existence of a path coupling . at the same time , we exploit the specific geometry of the square lattice to consider a greater variety of neighborhoods .",
    "moreover , the calculations necessary to find a good coupling in our setting are far more complicated than those in  @xcite and require several new ideas to become computationally tractable .    using the comparison method of diaconis and saloff - coste  @xcite , theorem [ t1 ] implies that the glauber and kempe chain markov chains also mix in polynomial time :    [ t2 ] the glauber and kempe chain markov chains on 6-colorings of the square lattice mix in @xmath16 time .    like theorem  [ t1 ] , this result holds on finite rectangular regions with free , fixed , or toroidal boundary conditions .    to discuss spatial mixing ,",
    "suppose we have a finite region @xmath17 and two colorings @xmath18 of its boundary that differ at a single vertex @xmath19 , and a subregion @xmath20 such that the distance from @xmath19 to the nearest point @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the probability distributions on colorings of @xmath25 , given the uniform distribution on colorings of @xmath17 conditioned on @xmath11 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "then we define spatial mixing as follows :    we say that @xmath0-colorings have _ strong spatial mixing _ if there are constants @xmath27 such that the total variation distance between @xmath23 and @xmath24 obeys @xmath28 .    in other words ,",
    "strong spatial mixing means that conditioning a uniformly random coloring of the lattice on the event that particular colors appear on vertices far away from @xmath19 has an exponentially small effect on the conditional distribution of the color of @xmath19 .",
    "physically , this means that correlations decay exponentially as a function of distance , and that the system has a unique gibbs measure and no phase transition .    the following recent result of dyer , sinclair , vigoda and weitz  @xcite ( see also the lecture notes by martinelli  @xcite ) relates optimal temporal mixing with spatial mixing : if the boundary constraints are _ permissive _ , i.e. , if a finite region can always be colored no matter how we color its boundary , and if the heat - bath dynamics on some finite block mixes in @xmath1 time , then the system has strong spatial mixing .",
    "as they point out , @xmath0-colorings are permissive for any @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , theorem 1 , which states that @xmath15 has optimal temporal mixing , implies the following result about spatial correlations .",
    "[ cor : spatial ] the uniform measure on the set of @xmath0-colorings of the square lattice , or equivalently the zero - temperature antiferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model on the square lattice , has strong spatial mixing for @xmath30 .    as mentioned above , physicists conjecture spatial mixing for @xmath2 . in the last section we discuss to",
    "what extent our techniques might be extended to @xmath31 .      given a markov chain @xmath32 ,",
    "let @xmath33 be its stationary distribution and @xmath34 be the probability distribution after @xmath35 steps starting with an initial configuration @xmath36 .",
    "then , for a given @xmath37 , the _ @xmath38-mixing time _ of @xmath32 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the total variation distance @xmath41 in this paper we will often adopt the common practice of suppressing the dependence on @xmath38 , which is typically logarithmic , and speak just of the mixing time @xmath42 for fixed small @xmath38 . thus the mixing time becomes a function of @xmath43 , the number of vertices , alone .",
    "we say that a markov chain has _ rapid mixing _",
    "if @xmath44 , and _ optimal ( temporal ) mixing _ if @xmath45 .",
    "the most common markov chain for the potts model is _",
    "glauber dynamics_. there are several variants of this in the literature , but for colorings we fix the following definition , which applies at zero temperature . at each step , choose a random vertex @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the set of colors , and let @xmath47 be the set of colors taken by @xmath19 s neighbors . then choose a color @xmath14 uniformly at random from @xmath48 , i.e. , from among the colors consistent with the coloring of @xmath49 , and recolor @xmath19 with @xmath14 .",
    "independently , jerrum  @xcite and salas and sokal  @xcite proved that for @xmath0-colorings on a graph of maximum degree @xmath50 the glauber dynamics ( i ) is ergodic for @xmath51 ( this holds for fixed boundary conditions as well ) and ( ii ) has optimal mixing for @xmath52 . for @xmath53 ,",
    "bubley and dyer  @xcite showed that it mixes in @xmath54 time and molloy  @xcite showed that it has optimal mixing . since the square lattice has @xmath55 , these results imply optimal mixing for @xmath56 .",
    "dyer and greenhill  @xcite considered a `` heat bath '' markov chain which updates both endpoints of a random edge simultaneously , and showed that it has optimal mixing for @xmath57 . by widening the updated region to include a vertex and all of its neighbors , bubley",
    ", dyer and greenhill  @xcite showed optimal mixing for @xmath3 for triangle - free graphs with maximum degree 4 , which includes the square lattice .",
    "another commonly used markov chain is the kempe chain algorithm , known in physics as the zero - temperature case of the _ wang - swendsen - koteck _",
    "algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it works as follows : we choose a random vertex @xmath19 and a color @xmath58 which differs from @xmath19 s current color @xmath59 .",
    "we construct the largest connected subgraph containing @xmath19 which is colored with @xmath59 and @xmath58 , and recolor this subgraph by switching @xmath59 and @xmath58 . in a major breakthrough ,",
    "vigoda  @xcite showed that a similar markov chain has optimal mixing for @xmath60 , and that this implied that the glauber dynamics and the kempe chain algorithm both have rapid mixing for @xmath61 .",
    "however , for the square lattice this again gives only @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath62 on the square lattice , luby , randall and sinclair  @xcite showed that a markov chain including `` tower moves '' has rapid mixing for any finite simply - connected region with fixed boundary conditions , and randall and tetali  @xcite showed that this implies rapid mixing for the glauber dynamics as well .",
    "recently goldberg , martin and paterson  @xcite proved rapid mixing for the glauber dynamics on rectangular regions with free boundary conditions , i.e. , with no fixed coloring of the vertices on their boundary .",
    "unfortunately , the technique of  @xcite relies on a bijection between 3-colorings and random surfaces through a `` height representation '' which does not hold for other values of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider two parallel runs of our markov chain , @xmath15 , with initial colorings @xmath63 .",
    "we will couple the steps of these chains in such a way that ( i ) each chain runs according to the correct distribution on its choices and ( ii ) with high probability , @xmath64 for some @xmath65 .",
    "a now standard fact in this area is that this implies that the chain mixes in time @xmath66 , i.e. this implies theorem  [ t1 ] ; this fact was first proved by aldous @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "bubley and dyer @xcite introduced the very useful technique of path coupling , via which it suffices to do the following : consider any two colorings @xmath67 which have a hamming distance one , i.e. , which differ on exactly one vertex , and carry out a single step of the chain on @xmath68 and on @xmath69 , producing two new colorings @xmath70 .",
    "we will prove that we can couple these two steps such that ( i ) each step is selected according to the correct distribution , and ( ii ) the expected hamming distance between @xmath71 and @xmath72 is at most @xmath73 for some constant @xmath74 .",
    "thus the expected change in the hamming distance between the two colorings is negative , @xmath75 .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for the formal ( by now standard ) details as to why this suffices to prove theorem  [ t1 ] .",
    "we perform the required coupling as follows .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be two arbitrary 6-colorings which only disagree at one vertex .",
    "we pick a uniformly random @xmath76 block @xmath9 , and let @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the set of permissible recolorings of @xmath9 according to @xmath79 respectively . for each @xmath80 , we define a carefully chosen probability distribution @xmath81 on the colorings of @xmath78 .",
    "we pick a uniformly random coloring @xmath82 and in @xmath68 we recolor @xmath9 with @xmath83 to produce @xmath71 .",
    "we then pick a random coloring @xmath84 according to the distribution @xmath85 and in @xmath69 we recolor @xmath9 with @xmath86 to produce @xmath72 .",
    "trivially , the marginal distribution @xmath87 is uniform on @xmath9 and @xmath77 . in order to ensure that the same is true of @xmath88 , we must have the following property for the set of distributions @xmath89 :    @xmath90    suppose that @xmath19 is the vertex on which @xmath79 differ .",
    "if @xmath91 then @xmath92 , so we can simply define @xmath93 ( i.e. , @xmath94 for each @xmath14 ) and this ensures that @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath9 does not contain @xmath19 or any neighbor of @xmath19 , then again @xmath92 and by defining @xmath93 we ensure that @xmath96 differ only on @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath19 is not in @xmath9 but is adjacent to a vertex in @xmath9 , then @xmath97 and so , depending on our coupling , it is quite possible that @xmath98 and so @xmath96 will differ on one or more vertices of @xmath9 as well as on @xmath19 .    for any pair @xmath99 ,",
    "we let @xmath100 denote the expected number of vertices in @xmath9 on which @xmath101 differ . for every possible pair @xmath99 we obtain a coupling satisfying ( [ c1 ] ) and : @xmath102 thus the expected change in the hamming distance between the two colorings is @xmath103 if @xmath104 and less than @xmath105 if @xmath19 is adjacent to @xmath9 .",
    "* proof of theorem [ t1 ] . *",
    "as described above , it suffices to prove that for any choice of @xmath79 differing only at @xmath19 , the expected hamming distance between @xmath71 and @xmath72 is less than @xmath73 for some @xmath74 , or equivalently that the expected change in the hamming distance is less than @xmath75 .",
    "let us consider toroidal boundary conditions first ; there are @xmath43 possible blocks from which the algorithm will choose , one for each vertex .",
    "each vertex is contained in @xmath106 blocks and is adjacent to @xmath107 blocks , so @xmath104 , or @xmath19 is adjacent to @xmath9 , with probability @xmath108 or @xmath109 respectively .",
    "thus the expected change in the hamming distance is less than @xmath110    for rectangular regions with free boundary conditions the situation is a little more complicated .",
    "a natural extension of the basic procedure is to chose any block that lies entirely in the region .",
    "this , however , means that a region of height @xmath111 and width @xmath112 with @xmath43 vertices will only have @xmath113 possible @xmath76 blocks ; furthermore , when the distinguished vertex @xmath19 is on or close to the boundary , the number of blocks containing @xmath19 is less than the 6 we have when @xmath19 is snugly in the interior , thereby lowering our chances of decreasing the hamming distance .",
    "it turns out that if we are dealing with free boundary conditions the natural extension will work anyway , since then the maximum expected change in the hamming distance when @xmath19 is on or close to the boundary and _ adjacent _ to our block is low enough to counteract the reduced chance that our choice of block will contain @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", we obtained these values for the expected change in the hamming distance when @xmath19 is adjacent to the block :    [ cols=\"<,<,^ , > \" , ]     as an example , when @xmath19 is in the corner of the lattice we now have 6 choices of a block containing @xmath19 , and five choices of a block adjacent to @xmath19 ; 2 of these choices are full @xmath76 blocks , and the remaining choices have sub - block sizes of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 respectively . hence the expected change in the hamming distance is less than @xmath117 we could work out the cost explicitly for the rest of the cases where the distinguished vertex @xmath19 is on or near the boundary , but it is easier just to note that in no case can the expected cost of coloring a block adjacent to @xmath19 be more than @xmath118 , and there can never be more than 10 adjacent blocks to choose from , so the expected change in the hamming distance can never be more than @xmath119 of course , we still need to prove that the desired couplings exist for each possible @xmath120 .",
    "these couplings were found with the aid of computer programs . in principle , for any pair @xmath120 , searching for the coupling that minimizes @xmath121 subject to ( [ c1 ] ) is simply a matter of solving a linear program and so can be done in polynomial time .",
    "however , the number of variables is @xmath122 which , _ a priori _ , can be roughly @xmath123 .",
    "furthermore , the number of possible pairs @xmath79 is roughly @xmath124 , and even after eliminating pairs which are redundant by symmetry , it is enormous . to deal with this combinatorial explosion we designed a fast heuristic which , rather than finding the best coupling for a particular pair , simply finds a very good coupling ; i.e. , one that satisfies ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "the code used can be found at ` www.cs.toronto.edu/~fvb ` . we provide a more detailed description in the next section .",
    "* method of the computation : * let @xmath125 denote the _ rim _ vertices , that is , those vertices which are adjacent to but outside of the block @xmath9 .",
    "we call a coloring of the vertices of @xmath125 a _ rim coloring_. for each possible pair of rim colorings @xmath79 which differ only at a vertex @xmath126 , we need to find a coupling between the extensions @xmath77 and @xmath78 of @xmath79 to @xmath9 , so that the couplings satisfy ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "these couplings were found with a small suite of programs working in two phases . in the first phase ,",
    "exhaustive lists of pairs of rim colorings ( reduced by equivalence with respect to allowable block colorings ) were generated . in the second phase , for each pair @xmath79",
    ", we generated @xmath99 separately ; these were then coupled , satisfying ( [ c1 ] ) , in a nearly optimal way to obtain a bound on @xmath121 that satisfies ( [ c2 ] ) .    *",
    "implementation : * all programs take the following parameters : number of colors , block dimensions , and an integer denoting the position of the distinguished vertex @xmath19 with respect to the block ( 0 if adjacent to the corner , @xmath127 if adjacent to the @xmath6th vertex along the top of the block , and @xmath128 if adjacent to the @xmath6th vertex along the side of the block ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 has color 0 in @xmath68 and 1 in @xmath69 .",
    "thus , if one specifies a rim coloring @xmath68 and the position of @xmath19 , then this determines @xmath69 . for each coloring",
    "@xmath68 we determined a good coupling for each non - equivalent position of @xmath19 .    by default",
    "the programs generate rim colorings and couplings on the assumption that the block is not on the boundary of the lattice ( i.e. , all rim vertices potentially constrain the allowable block colorings ) .",
    "free boundary cases , however , can easily be simulated by using values in the rim colorings that are outside the range determined by the number - of - colors parameter .",
    "these were only checked when the analysis of the non - boundary blocks yielded promising values .",
    "as mentioned above , the fixed arbitrary boundary cases required no new calculations , since from the block s `` point of view '' there is no difference ( in the worst case ) between being on an arbitrarily colored boundary and being in the interior .",
    "thus , we simply reused previously calculated values for smaller blocks on the interior to verify that the modified markov process would work . *",
    "generating rim colorings : * since the calculations required for phase 2 were much more time - consuming than those for phase 1 , the rim coloring generation procedure was designed to minimize the number of colorings output rather than the time used generating them .",
    "a rim coloring is represented by a vector of colors used on the rim , starting from the distinguished vertex @xmath19 and going clockwise around the block .",
    "if the set of colors is @xmath129 , we can assume by symmetry that @xmath19 s color is 0 in @xmath68 and 1 in @xmath69 .",
    "the following reductions were applied to avoid equivalent rim colorings : reduction by color isomorphism ( colors 2 and above ) , by exchange of colors 0 and 1 , by exchange of colors of vertices adjacent to the corners of the block , and by application of flip symmetries where applicable .    * finding a coupling for particular rim colorings : * two programs were used for each rim coloring @xmath68 , and position @xmath6 of @xmath19 . in each , the initial operation is the generation of all compatible lattice colorings ; this is done separately for col@xmath130 and col@xmath131 ( i.e. , for @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "the first program creates a set of linear programming constraints that is readable by the program lp - solve ( by michel berkelaar of the eindhoven university of technology ; it is available with some linux distributions ) .",
    "as mentioned above , time and space requirements made use of this procedure feasible only for checking individual rim colorings , and even then the block size had to be fairly modest .",
    "the second program calculates an upper bound on the optimal cost using a greedy algorithm to create a candidate coupling .",
    "given sets of colorings @xmath77 and @xmath78 of size @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively , the algorithm starts by assigning `` unused '' probabilities of @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively to the individual colorings .",
    "then , for each distance @xmath136 , for each coloring @xmath83 in @xmath77 it traverses @xmath78 looking for a coloring @xmath86 which differs from @xmath83 on exactly @xmath137 vertices .",
    "when such an @xmath86 is found it removes the coloring with the lower unused probability @xmath138 from its list and reduces the unused probability @xmath139 of the other to @xmath140 ; the distance @xmath141 is added to the total distance so far .",
    "the order in which the lists of colorings @xmath77 and @xmath78 is traversed does affect the solution , so an optional argument is available that allows the user to select one of several alternatives .",
    "this heuristic does not guarantee an optimal solution , and with some blocks and particular rim colorings the coupling it generates is far from the best .",
    "however , for the rim colorings we are most interested in ( ones where @xmath121 is high for all couplings ) it seems to consistently give results that are optimal or very close ( within 2% )",
    ". we can not give a rigorous bound on the running time , but a cursory analysis and empirical evidence suggest that it runs in roughly @xmath142 time , where @xmath143 is the number of compatible block colorings . because the heuristic is so much faster than the lp solver , our general procedure was as follows : ( 1 ) use the heuristic with the default traversal order to calculate bounds on the expected distance for all the rim colorings generated in phase one .",
    "( 2 ) when feasible , use the lp solver on those rim colorings that had the highest value of @xmath121 , to obtain an exact value for their maximum .",
    "( 3 ) for larger blocks or more colors than could be comfortably handled by the lp solver , use all available traversal orders on those rim colorings that had the maximum value of @xmath121 to obtain as tight a bound as possible within a feasible time .",
    "* results of the computations : * computations were run on various block sizes and numbers of colors in order to check the correctness of the programs , and also to collect data which could be used to estimate running times and maximum expected distance for larger block dimensions . for 7- and 8-colorings",
    "our results corresponded well with previous work on the problem ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    for 6-colorings , we checked @xmath144 blocks for @xmath145 , as well as @xmath115 and @xmath76 blocks . for all but the last of these the maximum",
    "expected distance we obtained was too large to give us rapid mixing .",
    "the @xmath76 subgrid has 2 non - equivalent positions with respect to the rim : the corner ( to which 8 rim vertices are adjacent ) and the middle of the top or bottom side ( to which 2 rim vertices are adjacent ) .",
    "denote these positions @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively . for each @xmath79 with @xmath19 in position 1 , we obtained a coupling satisfying : @xmath148 for each @xmath79 with @xmath19 in position 2 , we obtained a coupling satisfying : @xmath149 thus , in each case we satisfy ( [ c2 ] ) as required .    * a slightly stronger output : * by examining the problem a bit more closely",
    ", we see that condition ( [ c2 ] ) is sufficient , but not necessary , for our purposes .",
    "let @xmath150 denote the maximum of @xmath121 over the couplings found for all pairs @xmath79 where @xmath19 is in position @xmath6 , and let @xmath151 denote the number of rim vertices adjacent to position @xmath6 . then , being more careful about the calculation used in the proof of theorem [ t1 ] , and extending it to a general @xmath152 block , we see that the overall expected change in the hamming distance is at most ( in , say , the toroidal case where the number of possible blocks is @xmath43 ) @xmath153 a smaller value than that used in the proof of theorem 1 , where we ( implicitly ) used @xmath154 rather than @xmath155 .",
    "our programs actually compute this smaller value .",
    "even so , we could not obtain suitable couplings for any block size smaller than @xmath156 .",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ t2 ] , showing rapid mixing for the glauber and kempe chain dynamics , by following the techniques and presentation of randall and tetali  @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath157 and @xmath158 are two markov chains on the same state space with the same stationary distribution @xmath33 , and that we already have a bound on the mixing time of @xmath158 while we would like to obtain a bound for that of @xmath157 .",
    "let @xmath159 and @xmath160 denote the edges of these markov chains , i.e. , the pairs @xmath161 such that the transition probabilities @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively , are positive .",

    "furthermore , for each @xmath170 , let @xmath171 denote the set of pairs @xmath161 such that @xmath165 uses the edge @xmath172 .",
    "finally , let @xmath173 \\enspace .\\ ] ] note that @xmath174 depends on our choice of paths .    by combining bounds on the mixing time in terms of the spectral gap  @xcite with an upper bound on @xmath157 s spectral gap in terms of @xmath158 s due to diaconis and saloff - coste  @xcite , we obtain the following upper bound on @xmath157 s mixing time :    [ thm : comp ] let @xmath157 and @xmath158 be reversible markov chains on @xmath0-colorings of a graph of @xmath43 vertices whose unique stationary distribution is the uniform distribution .",
    "let @xmath175 be the largest eigenvalue of @xmath158 s transition matrix smaller than @xmath146 , let @xmath176 and @xmath177 denote the @xmath38-mixing time of @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively , and define @xmath174 as above .",
    "then for any @xmath178 , @xmath179    we omit the proof .",
    "the reason for the additional factor of @xmath43 is the fact that the upper and lower bounds on mixing time in terms of the spectral gap are @xmath180 apart , where @xmath181 is the minimum of @xmath182 taken over all states @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath33 in this case is the uniform distribution and there are at most @xmath183 colorings , we have @xmath184 . on the square lattice",
    ", it is easy to see that there are an exponentially large number of @xmath0-colorings for @xmath185 , so removing this factor of @xmath43 would require a different comparison technique .",
    "now suppose that @xmath158 is the block dynamics and @xmath157 is the glauber or kempe chain dynamics .",
    "we wish to prove theorem  [ t2 ] by showing that @xmath186 . by adding self - loops with probability greater than @xmath187 to the block dynamics",
    ", we can ensure that the eigenvalues of @xmath158 are positive with only a constant increase in the mixing time .",
    "therefore , it suffices to find a choice of paths for which @xmath174 is constant .",
    "since , for all three of these markov chains , each move occurs with probability @xmath188 , if @xmath169 and @xmath189 are constant then so is @xmath174 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath190 , we can carry out a block move on any finite neighborhood with glauber moves . we need to flip each vertex @xmath191 in the block to its new color ; however , @xmath191 s flip is blocked by a neighbor @xmath19 if @xmath19 s current color equals @xmath191 s new color .",
    "therefore , we first prepare for @xmath191 s flip by changing @xmath19 to a color which differs from @xmath191 s new color as well as that of @xmath19 s @xmath50 neighbors . if the neighborhood has @xmath143 vertices , this gives @xmath192 , or @xmath193 for @xmath15 .",
    "( with a little work we can reduce this to @xmath194 . ) for the kempe chain dynamics , recall that each move of the chain chooses a vertex @xmath19 and a color @xmath58 other than @xmath19 s current color .",
    "if @xmath58 is the color which the glauber dynamics would assign to @xmath19 , then none of @xmath19 s neighbors are colored with @xmath58 , and the kempe chain move is identical to the glauber move .",
    "since this happens with probability @xmath195 , the above argument applies to kempe chain moves as well , and again we have @xmath196 .",
    "moreover , we only need to consider moves that use kempe chains of size @xmath146 .",
    "finally , since each vertex appears in only @xmath197 blocks , the number of block moves that use a given glauber move or a given kempe chain move of size @xmath146 is bounded above by @xmath143 times the number of pairs of colorings of the block .",
    "thus @xmath198 , and we are done .    an interesting open question is whether we can prove _ optimal _ temporal mixing for the glauber or kempe chain dynamics .",
    "one possibility is to use log - sobolev inequalities as in  @xcite .",
    "we leave this as a direction for further work .",
    "we have run our programs on @xmath199 and @xmath200 blocks to see if we could achieve rapid mixing on 5 colors , but in both cases the largest values of @xmath121 were too high",
    ". it may be that rapid mixing on 5 colors is possible by recoloring a @xmath201 block , based on the decrease of the ratio of @xmath202 to @xmath203 as the dimensions increase ; similar reasoning leads us to believe that rapid mixing using a @xmath204 block is possible , but we would probably need a @xmath205 block or larger to achieve success . unfortunately , doing the calculations for @xmath201 blocks is a daunting proposition .",
    "the problem is exponential in two directions at once ( number of rim colorings , and number of block colorings for each rim coloring ) , so this would require a huge increase in the running time .",
