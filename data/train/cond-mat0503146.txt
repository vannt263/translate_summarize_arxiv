    "electron gas in a quantum wire is a realistic one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron system . by tying the wire ends to each other one creates a 1d ring .",
    "if the ring circumference is shorter than the electron coherence length , one speaks about the mesoscopic ring .",
    "an external magnetic flux applied through the opening of such ring gives rise to an equilibrium current , known as persistent current @xcite .",
    "observations of persistent currents in metallic and semiconducting rings @xcite stimulated many theoretical papers focused on the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction and disorder in such systems @xcite .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the observed amplitude of the currents is so far not satisfactory and the role of the e - e interaction and disorder in mesoscopic rings need further research @xcite . in this work we focus on the persistent current of interacting spinless electrons in a 1d ring with a single scatterer .",
    "let us review recent results for this simplified problem .",
    "if the e - e interaction is ignored , the leading behavior of the persistent current ( @xmath5 ) as a function of the magnetic flux ( @xmath6 ) and ring circumference ( @xmath1 ) can be derived analytically for an arbitrary scatterer @xcite .",
    "it is a periodic function of @xmath6 with period @xmath7 , it decays as @xmath8 , and its shape is determined by the absolute value of the transmission amplitude @xmath9 of the scatterer at the fermi wave vector @xmath10 . in the limit of small @xmath9 it reads @xmath11 .",
    "these results were derived for a continuous ring @xcite and hold also for the ring - shaped tight - binding lattice at half filling @xcite .    for a repulsive e - e interaction in the continuous ring",
    ", the spinless persistent current can still be derived analytically in the luttinger liquid model @xcite . for @xmath12 and for an arbitrary strength of the scatterer ,",
    "the current is @xmath13 , where the power @xmath4 is universal , depending only on the e - e interaction .    the authors of ref .",
    "obtained the spinless persistent current microscopically by solving the hubbard chain with nearest - neighbor hopping and interaction .",
    "using the renormalization group , they indeed found for a 1d ring with a single scatterer the current which decays faster than @xmath8 and is a sine - like function of @xmath6 . the shape @xmath14 and",
    "the universal scaling @xmath15 were confirmed for long chains and/or strong scatterers .",
    "they also concluded that the sine - like shape and the @xmath3 scaling can only be obtained in the correlated many - body model , not in the hartree - fock approximation ignoring the correlation effects .",
    "they used a non - self - consistent hartree - fock approximation and , indeed , found the qualitatively wrong results .",
    "the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation , according to these authors , drives the model with a single scatterer into the charge - density - wave groundstate with a finite single - particle gap , which is wrong because a single scatterer can not change the bulk properties of the system .",
    "hence , no attempt has been done to test the dependence @xmath13 in the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation .",
    "however , there is a motivation to do so .    indeed , recently @xcite the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation has been used to study tunneling of the weakly - interacting electron gas through a single scatterer in a continuous 1d wire with leads .",
    "it has been found that there is no charge - density - wave groundstate in such model , moreover , the tunneling probability has been found to decay with the wire length as @xmath16 , in accord with correlated models @xcite .",
    "all this suggests that an attempt to obtain the persistent current @xmath13 in the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation might be meaningful .",
    "we present such attempt in our present work . using the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation at zero temperature , we study the persistent current of the interacting spinless electron gas in a continuous 1d ring with a single @xmath0 barrier .",
    "we compare our results with the results of correlated models , with the luttinger liquid model @xcite and the microscopic hubbard model @xcite . a good agreement is found .",

    "<S> using the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation for spinless electrons at zero temperature , we study the persistent current of the interacting electron gas in a one - dimensional continuous ring containing a single @xmath0 barrier . we calculate the persistent current as a function of the ring circumference , magnetic flux threading the ring , barrier strength , etc . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the results of correlated models like the luttinger liquid model and the hubbard model solved by means of the renormalization group . a good agreement is found . </S>",
    "<S> first , the persistent current decays with the increasing ring circumference ( @xmath1 ) faster than @xmath2 and eventually like @xmath3 , where @xmath4 depends only on the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> second , the persistent current is a sine - shaped function of magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> this sine - like dependence and in particular the universal power law @xmath3 have sofar been believed to arise only in the correlated many - body models . </S>",
    "<S> observation of these features within the hartree - fock model is a surprising result . </S>"
