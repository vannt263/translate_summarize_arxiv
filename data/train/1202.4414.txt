    "we are concerned with the behavior of eigenfunctions of the dirichlet laplacian on dumbbell domains depending on a parameter and disconnecting in some limit process .",
    "more precisely , let us consider two slightly different domains which are connected by a thin tube so that the mass of a given eigenfunction is concentrated in one of the two domains .",
    "then the restriction of the eigenfunction to the other domain develops a singularity right at the junction of the tube , as the section of the channel shrinks to zero .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe the features of this singularity formation .",
    "a strong motivation for the interest in the spectral analysis of thin branching domains comes from the theory of quantum graphs modeling waves in thin graph - like structures ( narrow waveguides , quantum wires , photonic crystals , blood vessels , lungs ) and having applications in nanotechnology , optics , chemistry , medicine , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplace operator in varying domains has been intensively studied in the literature starting from @xcite and more recently in @xcite , where spectral continuity is discussed under different kind of perturbations and boundary conditions ( of either dirichlet or neumann type ) .",
    "the problem of rate of convergence for eigenvalues of elliptic systems was investigated in @xcite , while in @xcite estimates of the splitting between the first two eigenvalues of elliptic operators under dirichlet boundary conditions are provided .",
    "we also mention that some results on the behavior of eigenfunctions of the laplace operator under singular perturbation adding a thin handle to a compact manifold have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "as far as the nonlinear counterpart of the problem is concerned , the effect of the domain shape on the number of positive solutions to some nonlinear dirichlet boundary value problems has been investigated in @xcite , where domains constructed as connected approximations to a finite number of disjoint or touching balls have been considered , proving that the number of positive solutions which are not `` large '' grows with the number of the balls .",
    "when dealing with a dumbbell domain which is going to disconnect , the spectral continuity proved e.g. in @xcite implies that eigenfunctions of the approximating problem converge to the eigenfunction of some limit eigenvalue problem on a domain with two connected components , whose spectrum is therefore the union of the spectra on the two components ; as a consequence , if an eigenfunction of the limit problem is supported in one of the two domains , then the corresponding eigenfunction of the approximating problem is going to vanish on the other domain .",
    "we are going to show that a suitable normalization of such eigenfunction develops a singularity at the junction of the tube , whose rate is related to the order of the zero that the limit eigenfunction has at the other junction ( see theorem [ t : main ] ) .",
    "the description of the behavior of eigenfunctions at the junction will also provide informations about nodal sets ; more precisely we will prove in corollary [ c : cor ] that if the limit eigenfunction has at one junction of the tube a zero of order one , then the nodal regions of the corresponding eigenfunctions on the dumbbell stay away from the other junction .",
    "in this paper we set up a strategy to evaluate the rate to the singularity at the junction , based upon a sharp control of the transversal frequencies along the connecting tube . to this aim",
    ", we shall exploit the monotonicity method introduced by almgren @xcite in 1979 and then extended by garofalo and lin @xcite to elliptic operators with variable coefficients in order to prove unique continuation properties .",
    "we mention that monotonicity methods were recently used in @xcite to prove not only unique continuation but also precise asymptotics near singularities of solutions to linear and semilinear elliptic equations with singular potentials , by extracting such precious information from the behavior of the quotient associated with the lagrangian energy .    as a paradigmatic example , let us consider the following dumbbell domain in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6    .,width=264 ]    we also denote , for all @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the ball of radius @xmath11 centered at @xmath12 .",
