    "in last decade the physics of growth thin solid films and ion / atoms behaviors on flat film surfaces became well understood and investigated due to rapid progress in experimental methods of preparing thin films ( mainly mbe in uhv systems ) and microscopy ( mainly stm ) .",
    "also many papers devoted to theory of growth of rough surfaces and interfaces and crystal were published ( see @xcite for review ) .    here , we present a simple sos model  @xcite of epitaxial growth adopted for inhomogeneous @xmath0-like systems .",
    "the film growth described as a two step mechanism .",
    "the first step is the randomly picked position of initial contact of the incident particle on the film surface .",
    "this is followed by second step which is a relaxation process of local migration leading to final position of the particle sticking to the film .",
    "we simplify the model to the limited surface diffusion and neglect migration to more distant sites then nearest neighbors ( nn ) only .",
    "after the relaxation process particle sticks for the rest of the simulation .",
    "each particle is represented by a unit - volume cube which can occupy only discrete position in the lattice . the simple cubic symmetry is assumed .",
    "for a @xmath1 substrate we deposit @xmath2 particles of kind @xmath3 , followed by @xmath4 @xmath5-like particles and again @xmath2 of @xmath3 particles .",
    "the nominal thicknesses of @xmath3 and @xmath5 layers , are @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . in relaxation process",
    ", each particle tends to maximize the number of pplb .",
    "this tendency is slowed down by the barrier @xmath8 for diffusion which decreases probability of atom movement .",
    "the above growth model may be implemented as the following flowchart :    * for each newly arriving particle at random site @xmath9 , calculate the number of atomic pairs @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the place of the initial particle contact to the surface with all their four nn labeled by @xmath13 , * calculate the particle total energies in all five positions @xmath14 : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the bonding energy between @xmath17- and @xmath18-kind atoms , * evaluate probabilities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , of picking out each of the five virtual final positions of the atom , * reduce the probability @xmath21 of movement into @xmath13 by factor @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the diffusion barriers for @xmath3- and @xmath5-kind of atoms , respectively , * pick out one of five proposed sites for the atom with probability given by @xmath21 , @xmath14 .",
    "values of @xmath25 and @xmath8 are expressed in @xmath26 units , where @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath28 denotes the absolute temperature .",
    "diffusion barrier @xmath8 is positive , while the negative @xmath25 are compatible with the assumed tendency of the system to maximize the number of pplb .",
    "the simulations were performed on @xmath29 large square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the nominal thickness @xmath6 of both @xmath3-layers was set up to ten monolayers ( ml ) , while average thickness of @xmath5-spacer @xmath7 was varied from one to ten ml .",
    "the cases @xmath30 , or @xmath31 which blocks any diffusion , yields the same results as rd model , with poisson distribution of surface / interface heights .",
    "energy of magnetic coupling between magnetic layers separated by nonmagnetic spacer is often expressed by @xmath32 energy term , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are magnetizations in magnetic layers .",
    "the coupling @xmath35 depends strongly on nonmagnetic spacer thickness @xmath7 and may follow exponential law @xmath36 , or it may have an oscillatory character against @xmath7 as it also is often observed .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath37 manifests itself experimentally by modifications of some of magnetic properties such as susceptibility or ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "the coupling between magnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic spacer was shown for example for nife / cu / nife  @xcite and for ni / ag / nife samples  @xcite . in latter case for some samples also power decrease of @xmath35 with @xmath7 was observed .    for simple rd model distribution of spacer",
    "thickness @xmath38 follows poisson distribution @xmath39 , and probability of direct coupling between @xmath3-layers , corresponding to zero spacer height , decrease exponentially with average spacer thickness @xmath7 : @xmath40 .",
    "however , in film preparation technology , the growth conditions seldom correspond to rd model and so we expect deviations from poisson distribution as presented in fig .  [ fig_his ] .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d ) + ( e ) ( f )    \\(a ) + ( b )    for different sets of model parameters for non - rd , we found that decrease of number of bridges ( proportional to the direct coupling @xmath35 ) follow either exponential or the power law ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pb ] ) .",
    "variation of the spacer thickness is also essential for uniformity of the magnetic coupling between layers .",
    "we use root - mean - square @xmath41 of surface heights as a measure of surface roughness .",
    "the dependence of @xmath42-layer roughness on roughness of each of its components is described by : @xmath43 . for rd ,",
    "successive film heights are uncorrelated and thus : @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the situation for non - rd case is more complex ( see fig .  [ fig_sig]b - f ) .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d ) + ( e ) ( f )    we would like to consider roughness @xmath47 dependence on the spacer thickness @xmath7 for different model control parameters .",
    "for homogeneous films growth models roughness @xmath41 scaling with film thickness with family - vicsek law  @xcite : @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for large enough lattice size , and not too large average film thickness ,",
    "this dependence is given by a power law : @xmath51 .",
    "the dependence of exponent @xmath52 on model control parameters was discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . this way we are able to predict roughness @xmath53 of the first @xmath3 layer . however , determination of @xmath47 is more difficult .",
    "firstly , @xmath7 is small to guarantee clear dependence @xmath47 on @xmath7 .",
    "secondly , the growth of @xmath5 spacer is also controlled by @xmath54 until @xmath5-like coverage is sufficient to creating @xmath55-like pplb when becomes dependent on @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig_sig ] shows that @xmath47 increases with increasing of @xmath7 independently on @xmath25 and @xmath8 parameters .",
    "deviations from basic power scaling law , however , may be observed .",
    "we found from computer simulations that distribution of spacer heights around average thickness changes from poisson distribution ( or bell - shaped for larger thickness ) , to peak - shaped with a decrease of diffusion barriers @xmath8 and/or increasing @xmath25 , for a tendency of particles to create more pplb .",
    "the latter case helps to produce more uniform of magnetic coupling between layers in the sandwich tri - layer systems .",
    "energy of magnetic coupling between two magnetic moments @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be expressed by heisenberg term @xmath59 , where @xmath35 is the coupling constant .",
    "it is common to assume that this interaction is a short range one . for direct exchange interaction @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 only if @xmath63 .",
    "the direct coupling means that @xmath63 and strength of coupling @xmath35 between magnetic layers with magnetizations @xmath64 and @xmath65 may by evaluated as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of bridges between magnetic layers .",
    "usually , the decrease of @xmath35 with increasing spacer thickness follows exponential or power law .",
    "we found from computer simulations that number of bridges responsible for direct coupling is compatible with the above predictions , and either exponential or power law may be obtained for specific set of model parameters .",
