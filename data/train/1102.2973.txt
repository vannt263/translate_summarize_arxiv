    "these two conditions can be realized only in high dimensions ( not possible in one dimension ) .",
    "unusual results were reported for the dynamics with the combination of these two conditions  @xcite .",
    "in particular it was found that the zero mass limit and the over - damping limit are different in reducing the kramers equation to the fokker - planck equation .",

    "one example is a non - zero torque generated in a nano heat engine in contact with two different heat reservoirs  @xcite . for a nonlinear drift force , it has recently been found via a perturbation theory that there exists an additional current , that is absent for the linear case , due to the combination of the force non - linearity and the multi - dimensional noise correlation  @xcite .",

    "<S> we present the theoretical study on non - equilibrium ( neq ) fluctuations for diffusion dynamics in high dimensions driven by a linear drift force . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a general situation in which neq is caused by two conditions : ( i ) drift force not derivable from a potential function and ( ii ) diffusion matrix not proportional to the unit matrix , implying non - identical and correlated multi - dimensional noise . </S>",
    "<S> the former is a well - known neq source and the latter can be realized in the presence of multiple heat reservoirs or multiple noise sources . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a statistical mechanical theory based on generalized thermodynamic quantities such as energy , work , and heat . </S>",
    "<S> the neq fluctuation theorems are reproduced successfully . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the time - dependent probability distribution function exactly as well as the neq work production distribution @xmath0 in terms of solutions of nonlinear differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we compute low - order cumulants of the neq work production explicitly . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> we carry out numerical simulations to check out our analytic results and also to get @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find an interesting dynamic phase transition in the exponential tail shape of @xmath0 , associated with a singularity found in solutions of the nonlinear differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss possible realizations in experiments . </S>"
