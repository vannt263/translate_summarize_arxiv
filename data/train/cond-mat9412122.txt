    "multiple scattering in disordered systems is a field of wide interest ; it is studied in electronic , microwave and optical systems . in the multiple scattering regime",
    "the main transport in transmission is through diffusion . yet",
    "interference processes , possible by the underlying wave character , play an important role .",
    "this interference leads to interesting effects such as the enhanced backscatter cone@xcite , short- , and long - range correlations@xcite , and strong localization .",
    "if interference occurs between diffusion paths , it causes large fluctuations .",
    "most famous are the sample - to - sample fluctuations in the conductance of electronic systems , the so called universal conductance fluctuations@xcite , but also other transmission quantities are influenced by interference .",
    "recently , the attention is not only drawn to the variance of the fluctuations , but to the entire distribution functions .",
    "examples are the intensity distribution in speckle patterns for classical waves @xcite and the conductance distribution for electronic systems @xcite .",
    "the size of the fluctuations and the shape of the distribution is related to the ` distance ' from the localization transition . far from localization ,",
    "diffusion channels are almost uncorrelated and fluctuations are small ( except for the optical speckle pattern in the angular resolved transmission ) .",
    "the correlation between the channels increases if the localization is approached .",
    "the relevant parameter is the inverse dimensionless conductance @xmath3 , which can be interpreted as the chance that two channels interfere .",
    "the dimensionless conductance can be expressed in the thickness of the sample @xmath4 , the mean free path @xmath5 , and the number of channels @xmath6 , @xmath7 the number of channels is calculated in analogy with a waveguide , where it is unambigiously defined . in the diffuse mesoscopic regime @xmath8 will be a small parameter of our perturbation theory ( experimentally this proved fully justified , as there @xmath9 , @xcite ) .",
    "close to anderson localization @xmath10 approaches unity , and fluctuations increase .",
    "the central question is how the distributions change as the strong localization regime is approached@xcite .",
    "let us briefly review some characteristics of optical transmission distributions functions in the regime of moderate @xmath10 . in the study of mesoscopic systems using light scatterering , one takes a small sample with static scatterers . in order to average",
    ", one needs to sum over a large number of scatterer configurations , in practice this is done by varying an external parameter such that the interference pattern is completely changed .",
    "whereas in electronic systems it is common to vary the fermi energy or apply a magnetic field , in optics one usually varies the wavelength of the light .",
    "in contrast to electronic systems , not only the conductance but three different transmission quantities can be measured in optical systems .",
    "( an exception is the very recent observation of electron speckle by gao _ et al_. @xcite . )",
    "first , the angular resolved transmission can be considered : if a laser shines on the sample , a speckle pattern is seen in the transmission .",
    "if one measures the intensity in an outgoing direction @xmath11 , this corresponds to measuring the angular transmission coefficient @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the incoming and @xmath11 the outgoing channel .",
    "the intensities in the speckle pattern have in zeroth order in @xmath10 an exponential distribution @xmath14 which is also known as the rayleigh law .",
    "deviations from this law occur if interference between the transmitted intensities , the diffusons , is taken into account : the higher moments of the distribution function increase .",
    "for large values of the transmission a stretched exponential was observed@xcite , which was recently predicted as@xcite @xmath15 .",
    "one obtains another transmission quantity , if one collects all the outgoing light , and also all incoming directions are used , i.e. using a diffuse incoming waves instead of a plane wave . in this case one summes over all incoming and outgoing channels and the conductance of the sample , @xmath16 is measured .",
    "it corresponds to the well known conductance measurement for electron systems .",
    "the conductance has roughly a gaussian distribution .",
    "the absolute variance is larger than expected classically because of interference and it does not depend on the sample parameters ( hence the name universal conductance fluctuations)@xcite .",
    "equivalently , the relative variance is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the full distribution function of the conductance was studied by altshuler _",
    "@xcite , who predict a log - normal tail for the tail of the distribution function . for the lower cumulants",
    "they predict that @xmath18 .",
    "note , however , that the prefactors maybe zero , as macdo @xcite found that @xmath19 .",
    "we are , however , interested in yet another transmission quantity .",
    "it is obtained by spatially integrating the speckle pattern on the outgoing side , and taking an incoming plane wave .",
    "one thus obtains an intermediate quantity between the angular transmission @xmath12 and the conductance @xmath20 .",
    "it is termed the total transmission @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity is the subject of this paper .",
    "the total transmission is a constant superposed with fluctuations . in first order of @xmath8",
    "the fluctuations have a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "the relative variance of this distribution is proportional to @xmath8 , it is thus a factor @xmath10 larger than for the conductance fluctuations .",
    "this sensitivity of the total transmission to interference processes and its simple limiting behavior ( as compared to the angular resolved transmission ) make it an ideal quantity to study mesoscopic transmission .",
    "its full distribution was studied numerically in 2d by edrei it et al . who recovered the gaussian distribution function , tending towards a log - normal distribution near the anderson transition@xcite .",
    "the full distribution function was recently derived@xcite .",
    "it was shown that it has a log - normal distribution growth , and an exponential tail .",
    "recently the third cumulant of the distribution was found experimentally by de boer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the theoretical details of that work .",
    "we focus on the gaussian distribution and the deviation from the gaussian due to the presence of the third cumulant .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the diffusion in optical systems is described in section [ secdif ] ; in section [ seccum ] the character of the probability distribution is discussed . in section",
    "[ sect2 ] and [ sect3]+[secinf ] , respectively , we calculate the second and third cumulant of the probability distribution .",
    "next we calculate experimental corrections to our result in section [ secz0 ] and [ secjoh ] , after which we compare our results with the experimental data in section [ secres ] .",
    "we close with a discussion .",
    "consider the transport of light through a three dimensional slab with static scatterers in a random configuration .",
    "the slab has a thickness @xmath4 .",
    "diffuse mesoscopic regime is characterized by @xmath22 . here @xmath5 denotes the mean free path and @xmath23 denotes the wavelength in the medium .",
    "isotropic scattering is assumed .",
    "we also work in the scalar wave approximation .",
    "it is known that the two independent polarization directions of light effectively double the number of channels @xmath6 in the problem as compared to the scalar wave case@xcite .",
    "apart from a small correction term , our final result does not depend on the number of channels and the doubling .",
    "we take the depth in the the slab as the @xmath24-coordinate , the slab thus corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "a plane scalar wave with unit flux and area @xmath26 impinges on the sample from direction @xmath13 .",
    "it is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the wavenumber , @xmath29 is the transversal coordinate , @xmath30 is the transverse component of the momentum , and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the angle with respect to the @xmath33axis .",
    "the number of channels depends on the area of the incoming beam . dividing the total area of the beam with diameter @xmath34 in small coherence regions of area @xmath35 , one obtains in analogy with waveguides @xmath36 , or the weyl formula @xmath37 .",
    "the factor @xmath38 comes from the two independent polarization directions . for the case of scalar wave scattering this doubling factor should be left out .",
    "the main contribution to the average transmission is given by the diffuse transport of intensity .",
    "this means that the two amplitudes , which make up the intensity , scatter on the same scatterers following the same path through the sample . in a diagrammatic language",
    "these processes are known as diffusons or ladder diagrams .",
    "an example of such a scattering process in drawn in fig.[figdif ] , in the following we will depict the diffuson by close parallel lines and omit the scatterers for clarity .    in the bulk the diffuse intensity obeys simply the diffusion equation , but the precise prefactors from the coupling to the outside have to be determined from the schwarzschild - milne equation @xcite @xmath39 this is a self - consistent transport equation which gives the diffuse intensity @xmath40 resulting from a source @xmath41 .",
    "the kernel @xmath42 describes the intensity decay between two scatterings . in the ladder approximation ( without internal reflections )",
    "it is @xmath43 the source term @xmath41 is given by the single scattered incoming intensity .",
    "our incoming plane wave leads to a source in the milne equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is scatterer density , @xmath46 is the @xmath47matrix , giving the mean free path @xmath48 .",
    "the transport equation ( [ eqmilne ] ) now yields for an incoming diffuson @xmath49 where @xmath50 describes the limit intensity of a semi - infinite system , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now the prefactors are known , we continue with the diffusion equation , which holds a few mean free paths away from the surface .",
    "we generalize to the case where the amplitudes making up the diffuson have a non - zero momentum . for the corresponding diffusion propagator propagating from the point @xmath24 to the point",
    "@xmath51 it holds that @xmath52 with approximate boundary conditions @xmath53 . here @xmath54 is a two - dimensional vector , defined as the difference of perpendicular momenta of the two incoming amplitudes making up the diffuson . if coherent waves impinge with a different angle on the sample , this net transverse momentum of diffusons need not be zero and the diffusons decay exponentially with the inverse decay length equals @xmath55 . the solution of the diffusion equation reads @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "below we also need incoming diffusons with transverse momentum , they are obtained by combing the prefactor of eq .",
    "( [ eqdifin ] ) with the @xmath59 dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eqladq ] ) .",
    "the total transmission is obtained by integrating over the outgoing channels . in the experimental geometry of ref .",
    "@xcite , the outgoing radiation was collected in a integrating sphere .",
    "only outgoing diffusons where its amplitudes are exactly in phase ( i.e. have opposite phase ) are leading after this integration .",
    "therefore the outgoing diffuson can have no transverse momentum . the transport equation ( [ eqmilne ] )",
    "yields an outgoing diffuson from a unit source @xmath60 the total transmission is obtained by connecting the incoming to the outgoing diffuson , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath61 here we included the doubling from the two polarization directions .",
    "also integrating over all incoming directions yields the conductance@xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 this equals our previous definition ( [ eqdefg ] ) .",
    "in this section we introduce the probability distribution of the total transmission of scalar waves and we discuss some of its properties . the corrections for vector waves will be made in section [ secjoh ] .",
    "we will link the moments of the distribution to diagrams .",
    "the moments of the probability distribution @xmath64 can be extracted as @xmath65 in a diagrammatic approach the @xmath28-th moment can be represented by a diagram with @xmath28 diffusons on both incoming and outgoing side .",
    "the @xmath66 term is the average total transmission @xmath67 , as given by the schwarzschild - milne equation in eq.([eqtaav ] ) .",
    "this quantity is given by a single diffuson and is thus independent of channel - to - channel correlations .",
    "the second moment can be decomposed in the first two cumulants : @xmath68 the double brackets denote cumulants normalized to the average .",
    "diagrammatically the second moment is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figt2 ] .",
    "the decomposition in cumulants will prove useful as each cumulant corresponds to a different number of interactions between the diffusons .",
    "in the first term , fig .",
    "[ figt2](a ) there is no interference ; it factorizes in the average transmission squared ( apart from a small correction discussed in section [ secjoh ] ) . the second term , fig .",
    "[ figt2](b ) , is the second cumulant @xmath69 .",
    "it gives the variance of the fluctuations .",
    "interactions between two diffusons are responsible for the presence of this second cumulant .",
    "the interference process is in a diagrammatical language the so - called hikami - box , it is depicted as the shaded square in the figure . in the box two amplitudes of the incoming diffusons are interchanged , causing a correlation between the outgoing ones .",
    "precisely the same process was studied in the more general context of the long range correlation functions@xcite . in the work of de",
    "boer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and garcia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite the correlation between two diffusons with different frequency was measured .",
    "this is the so called @xmath70 correlation function : @xmath71 .",
    "for our case find that @xmath72 and thus corresponds to the peak value of this correlation function . in the next section we will calculate this cumulant in detail .",
    "similar to the second moment , one can distinguish three different contributions to the third moment , @xmath73 the corresponding leading diagrams are drawn in fig .",
    "[ figt3 ] .",
    "the first term , fig .  [ figt3](a ) , again corresponds to the transmission without interference . the second term , fig .",
    "[ figt3](b ) , is reducible in a single diffuson and a second cumulant diagram . from the figure it is clear that this decomposition can be done in three ways which is reflected in the prefactor of @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ t3= ] ) .",
    "the third contribution stands for the third cumulant in the distribution and expresses the leading deviation from the gaussian distribution .",
    "this is the term we are mainly interested in .",
    "it consists of two related diagrams : fig.[figt3](c+d ) .",
    "the three intensities can interfere twice two by two , or the intensities can interact all three together , with a so called hikami six - point vertex . both contributions will prove to be of the same order of magnitude . the strength of the effect can be easily estimated using the interpretation of @xmath3 as a interaction probability . by looking at the diagram , the third cumulant is proportional to the chance of two diffusons meeting twice , thus of the order @xmath75 .",
    "we find the basic result @xmath76 the rest of the paper essentially consist of proving this relation and determination of the prefactor .",
    "finally we will compare this relation to the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite .    because only a limited number of channels is sampled in an experiment ,",
    "the law of large numbers predicts a distribution with some non - zero width even if we only would consider disconnected diagrams .",
    "however , we will show in section [ secjoh ] that this effects brings only a negligible contribution to the measured cumulants .",
    "the large fluctuations are almost only due to the interference .",
    "note that in our calculations diagrams with loops are neglected .",
    "an example of a loop diagram is the @xmath77 ( or universal conductance fluctuation ) contribution to the second cumulant@xcite .",
    "one of the @xmath77 diagrams is a second cumulant diagram where the outgoing diffusons are again input for another hikami - box .",
    "( it is like glueing two second cumulant diagrams after each other . )",
    "this diagram contains two hikami boxes , therefore it gives a contribution of order @xmath17 to the second cumulant .",
    "in general , one easily sees that in order to create a loop , one needs a higher number of interference vertices .",
    "therefore , these diagrams are of higher order in @xmath3 , and we did not calculate them .",
    "the leading contributions to the cumulants are by far sufficient for the description of the experiment of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we recover the results for the second cumulant .",
    "this quantity was often calculated in literature . in the work of the boer _",
    "et al._@xcite the frequency correlation in the total transmission was calculated using a langevin approach introduced by spivak and zyuzin@xcite , see also pnini and shapiro@xcite . here",
    "we obtain the same results using a diagrammatic technique@xcite .",
    "we calculate the diagram of fig.[figt2](b ) .",
    "the interaction vertex of the diffusons is the hikami four point vertex or hikami box@xcite .",
    "the hikami box is depicted in fig.[figh4sob ] ; from the figure it is easily seen that the vertex interchanges two amplitudes of the incoming diffusons . as is shown in fig.[figh4sob ] , the full vertex is ( in second order born approximation ) the sum of one bare vertex and two vertices with an additional scatterer .",
    "( if the scatterers are near resonance , the second order born approximation is no longer valid and more diagrams are relevant . however , for the four point vertex it was explicitly proven in ref.@xcite that this will only be reflected in the different value of the mean free path . ) the summation of the diagrams yields@xcite @xmath78   \\label { haha } .\\ ] ] to this vertex two incoming diffusons , @xmath13 and @xmath79 , and two outgoing diffusons , @xmath11 and @xmath80 , are attached .",
    "the @xmath81 denotes the _ three dimensional _ momentum of the corresponding diffuson .",
    "the momenta are pointing towards the vertex .",
    "for our second cumulant diagram of fig.[figt2](b ) we have numbered @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "as stated above , only the outgoing diffusons where the amplitudes have exactly opposite phase are leading in the total transmission measurements .",
    "therefore the transversal momenta of the outgoing diffusons must be zero @xmath86 , but as amplitudes are exchanged in the hikami - box , the incoming diffusons can have a transversal component in their momentum . using momentum conservation one",

    ", they yield approximately a source term near the boundary of the sample . in the integral",
    "these contributions are of the negligible order . in the plane wave limit of the incoming beam ,",

    "if the spot of the incoming beam is finite , amplitudes with different transverse momenta are present .",
    "they can combine into incoming diffusons with perpendicular momentum .",
    "we suppose that the incoming beam has a gaussian profile .",
    "it is decomposed into plane waves defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqplanewave ] ) ( for convenience we assume perpendicular incidence ) @xmath93 where @xmath34 is the beam diameter . in order to have two diffusons with a momentum @xmath54 and @xmath94",

    "this is done similar to the calculation above , but now the @xmath97-terms in eq.([haha2 ] ) should be taken into account , as well as the @xmath98-dependence of the incoming diffusons , see eq.([eqladq ] ) .",
    "( the outgoing diffusons still have no such momentum . )",
    "the total cumulant is now found by integrating over the momentum with the corresponding weight . for a gaussian beam profile one finds@xcite @xmath99 with @xmath100/[2x \\sinh^2 x]$ ] . if the incoming beam is again very broad , @xmath101 , only the term @xmath102 contributes and one recovers the plane wave behavior @xmath103 .",
    "note that this agreement is found by identifying the area of a gaussian profile with @xmath104 .",
    "this definition is somewhat arbitrary and other choices are also possible@xcite . after fixing this definition ,",
    "no freedom remains and we will see that for the third cumulant a gaussian profile leads to other results than a plane wave .    the second cumulant decreases as @xmath105 at large @xmath34 . in a real space picture",
    "it is evident that the correlation increases if the two incoming channels are closer to each other , i.e. if the beam diameter is smaller . in the experiment of ref.@xcite the focus",
    "was kept small in order to minimize the dimensionless conductance @xmath10 and therefore to maximize the fluctuations .",
    "we now discuss the calculation the third cumulant .",
    "as mentioned , there are two processes contributing .",
    "one with two four point vertices which we term @xmath106 and one with a six point vertex @xmath107 , where we have chosen the subscript according to fig .",
    "[ figt3 ] .",
    "this process was , to our knowledge , not studied before .",
    "our calculation follows the lines of the second cumulant calculation .",

    "[ figt3](d ) .",
    "it can be thought of the following way : the use of hikami box in the previous section assumes that the outgoing legs scatter at least once before they propagate out or interfere again .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the outgoing diffusons , but for the internal diffuson @xmath132 it also possible that coming from @xmath24 it directly , i.e. without scattering , interferes again at @xmath51 .",
    "this process is not included in the calculation of the previous section but has to be studied separately .",
    "the unscattered intensity decays exponentially over one mean free path , therefore this process is only important if @xmath24 and @xmath51 are within one mean free path . we denote the corresponding vertex as @xmath133 , as six diffusons are connected to this diagram .",
    "this diagram was also already calculated by hikami@xcite . also here",

    "[ figt3](c ) , and should thus not be counted .",
    "yet this observation is useful to check the combinatorical ratio between the six point vertex and the composed diagram : the forbidden dressing can be performed in three ways .",

    "in the limit of an incoming plane wave we find a contribution to the third cumulant @xmath138 the contribution from the source term , i.e. eq.([h4bron ] ) of the previous section , exactly cancels the contribution from the six - point vertex .",
    "the cancellation seems plausible as one does not expect short distances properties to be important in the total process .",
    "nevertheless , this cancellation depends on the precise form of the hikami four - point vertex in eq.([eqh4keus ] ) .",
    "if we use other equivalent forms of the hikami - box the contributions of the single and double integral in eq.([eqt3hh ] ) are shifted with respect to each other and a full cancellation is not present .",
    "of course , neither the result for eq.([eqt3hh ] ) nor the final result for @xmath0 relies on this choice .",
    "the precise mechanism behind this is not clear to us .",
    "however , using the cancellation we only need to consider the term in eq.([eqt3hh ] ) , which comes from @xmath124 , @xmath139 and the permutations .",

    "this effect is best understood .",
    "the correlation depends on the distance : it is strongest if the incoming intensities are close .",

    "it then turns out that the behavior of eq.([eqt3 g ] ) is actually seen for a large range of beam diameters .",
    "the increase of the correlation for smaller beams , turns out to be roughly the same for both the third cumulant and the second cumulant squared .",
    "all corrections to ( [ eqt3 g ] ) turn out to be relatively small , as we will discuss below . apart from this advantage ,",
    "errors in the sample thickness and the mean free path cancel by presenting the results as the ratio between the second cumulant squared and the third cumulant .",
    "in this section we calculate the influence of internal reflection on our results , and show that it is small .",
    "it was seen in previous work@xcite that surface reflection decreases the @xmath70 correlation . in eq.([eqt3 g ] ) corrections from boundary reflection cancel partly .",
    "we did not calculate the influence of internal reflections for the general case , but only for the case of very broad beams ( i.e. only for @xmath54 independent diffusons ) .",
    "one expects that this behavior may be extrapolated to the @xmath153dependent case .",

    "they are given by the connected diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figt2](b ) and figs .",

    "they describe effects which have little to do with the interference effects we are after . here",
    "we calculate their contribution and show that they are small .",
    "we first explain the contribution of fig .",
    "[ figt2](a ) to the second cumulant . as a start",
    "we use the model of a waveguide .",
    "we assume that the disorder couples one incoming mode @xmath13 to all outgoing modes .",
    "a waveguide has discrete modes , and for the moment we assume that different outgoing modes are uncorrelated .",
    "the second moment @xmath162 is split into a connected part @xmath163 , fig .",

    "is given by the speckle distribution function eq .",
    "( [ eqray ] ) , @xmath167 . from eq.([eqdis2 ] ) we see that the disconnected diagram @xmath168 does not completely factorize into the average squared @xmath169",
    ". therefore it contributes to the second cumulant . as shown above ,",
    "the connected part of the second moment of the total transmission @xmath170 is proportional to @xmath171 . for the sum of the disconnected and the connected contribution to the second cumulant one",
    "thus finds @xmath172 which also holds for plane wave case .",
    "after this we turn to the situation of a diffusely scattering slab , with a finite focus of the incoming beam .",
    "the incoming beam will be broadened in the transverse direction by diffusion , changing the above result .",
    "to calculate the different contributions to the cumulants , for the moment the intensity distribution at the exit interface at transversal coordinates @xmath173 and @xmath174 is needed .",

    "[ johfig2 ] .",
    "we explicitly evaluated this term .",
    "the calculation follows completely the line of the second cumulant calculation , yet it is slightly more complicated as it has a @xmath153dependent outgoing diffuson .",
    "the integration over @xmath201 and @xmath202 gives a factor @xmath203 . comparing the result with the last two terms in third cumulant in the waveguide model , eq .",
    "( [ cum3reducapprox ] ) , we define @xmath204 as @xmath205 the number @xmath204 is inversely proportional to the contribution of disconnected diagrams to the third cumulant for a gaussian profile .",
    "the vector character of the light has not been taken into account yet .",
    "the two independent polarizations of each outgoing direction effectively double the number of independent speckle spots @xmath6 .",
    "thus for an incoming plane wave of unit intensity with fixed polarization the total transmission and the conductance @xmath10 are twice as large as they would be in the scalar case .",
    "as we work with normalized cumulants , this effect reduces only the value of the second cumulant ( @xmath206 ) and the value of the third cumulant ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "therefore , it is immediately seen that the relation @xmath208 ( eq .",
    "[ eqt3 g ] ) is not affected .",
    "the vector character does reduce the correction eq .",
    "( [ modesdef ] ) by a factor @xmath38 . for the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite the number of modes @xmath6 as well as @xmath204 is listed in table  [ sampletab ] ( including the doubling ) .    summarizing the previous sections we have included three corrections .",
    "we first obtained the result for very broad gaussian beams , in the large @xmath209 limit , eq .",
    "( [ eqt3 g ] ) .",
    "the first correction was the influence of a finite beam diameter , it changes the diffuse intensity from linear into an exponentially decaying , see eq .",
    "( [ eqladq ] ) .",
    "this correction is contained in eq .",
    "( [ eqdeff ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ k3 ] ) .",
    "the presence of internal reflections also changes the spatial dependence of the diffuse intensity resulting in a correction eq .",
    "( [ eqt3z0 ] ) .",
    "the third correction is of another nature , it is the only process which does not come from interference , but from disconnected diagrams .",
    "only this term depends the number of modes , which in the vector case is twice as large as in the scalar case .",
    "the data set found experimentally in ref.@xcite is reproduced in table [ sampletab ] and fig .  [ figresult ] .",
    "the experiments reported there were performed with seven different samples .",
    "the experimental setup and measurement technique used is extensively described in ref.@xcite .",
    "samples consisted of 36 vol.% rutile @xmath210 pigment on a transparent substrate .",
    "the extrapolation length was estimated from the effective index of refraction to be @xmath211 .",
    "the absorption length @xmath212 was determined to be @xmath213 .",
    "different values of the conductance @xmath10 were probed by taking various sample thicknesses and by varying the beam diameter .",
    "the fluctuations in the total transmission were measured by varying the wavelength of the light .    for a very broad beam we found the simple relation ( [ eqt3 g ] ) between second and third cumulant . a weighted least square fit to @xmath214 of the raw experimental data",
    "yields a prefactor @xmath215 .",
    "however , as discussed above , there are three corrections to be made .",
    "first , if the beam width becomes comparable to sample thickness the integrals ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ k3 ] ) have to be performed : if the beam width reduces , @xmath10 decreases accordingly and both cumulants increase in absolute size . yet",
    "the precise increase is somewhat different resulting in a somewhat smaller prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eqt3 g ] ) .",
    "we corrected each data point individually for its finite focus , mapping it to the infinite focus case .",
    "the third cumulant was multiplied by a factor which ranged from 1.03 to 1.13 , as @xmath216 ranged from 0.41 to 6.3 , see table  [ sampletab ] .",
    "this is the largest correction , it changes the prefactor some 10% .",
    "secondly , we corrected for internal reflections according to eq.([eqt3z0 ] ) .",
    "the third correction comes from the disconnect diagrams .",
    "the contributions from the disconnected diagrams are substracted from the measured cumulants .",
    "after all these corrections the data should again obey the law : @xmath217 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.[figresult ] , where the points are the corrected data points and the line is the theoretical prediction .",
    "a least square fit gives @xmath218 note that there is no adjustable parameter .",
    "we find that there is good agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "all corrections are minor as compared to the error in the data , fitting the raw data is also in agreement with the theoretical value of 3.2 .",
    "we recall that the major shift between fits of raw and corrected data comes from the beam diameter coreection . inspecting the figure one",
    "might be tempted to make a linear fit , but in ref.@xcite it was shown that this fit is statistically very improbable .",
    "we have calculated the second and third cumulant of the distribution of the total transmission underlying the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite and compared it to the experimental data .",
    "both cumulants are a consequence of interference between diffuse channels .",
    "they were calculated with a diagrammatic technique .",
    "the inverse dimensionless conductance , interpreted as an interference probability , is a perturbation parameter in the theory .",
    "the third cumulant is proportional to the second cumulant squared .",
    "we also found a non - trivial dependence on the profile of the incoming beam used .",
    "the cumulants were calculated for arbitrary beam diameter , but the influence of a finite focus on the ratio is rather weak . also boundary reflections were included .",
    "our calculations confirm that the main contributions come from diagrams with interference processes , i.e. connected diagrams , as we have shown that the contributions from disconnected diagrams is small .",
    "the experimentally found ratio of the third cumulant versus the second cumulant squared is well described by our theory .",
    "the extension of the calculations to higher cumulants is straightforward .",
    "the @xmath45-th cumulant will contain @xmath219 hikami four - point vertices .",
    "so the contribution is estimated to be : @xmath220 . also corrections and cancellations from higher order vertices",
    "are present , but it is clear that the calculation becomes very laborious at large @xmath45 .",
    "recently two of the authors discovered that all the cumulants of the distribution function can be mapped onto the moments of the eigenvalue distribution of the transmission matrix@xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution is bimodal and was first calculated using random matrix techniques@xcite but recently its validity beyond quasi-1d was proven@xcite .",
    "as the eigenvalue distribution is known , the entire distribution of the total transmission was calculated in the limit of broad beams .",
    "these results agree with calculations presented here for the first three cumulants .",
    "the experimental data thus also proof the first few moments of the eigenvalue distribution function .",
    "as only three moments are known , it is impossible to reconstruct the full eigenvalue distribution from the experimental data .",
    "the present calculation leads us to assume that the eigenvalue distribution in a diagrammatic approach is also given by loopless connected diagrams .",
