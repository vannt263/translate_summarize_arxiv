    "the  mission @xcite has revolutionized the study of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows . with",
    "it was possible for the first time to access the earliest phase of x - ray afterglows . in the pre-  era observations of the x - ray afterglow",
    "were limited to the normal decay phase , typically starting roughly a day after detecting the burst . during the batse era only a relatively small number of bursts were actually followed up by x - ray observatories such as bepposax@xcite .",

    ",  has discovered more than 800 grbs , providing the largest sample of grbs with prompt and afterglow emission observations .",
    "the prompt emission is likely the result of internal shocks produced in the newly formed jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further models include photospheric emission including either baryon- @xcite or magnetic field @xcite dominated ejecta .",
    "additionally magnetic reconnection irrespective of the photospheric emission can be responsible for the prompt emission @xcite .    for the afterglow ,",
    "the external shock scenario @xcite is observationally the most supported mechanism with modifications involving jet opening angle effects @xcite , the nature of the interstellar medium ( wind or constant density profile @xcite ) or possible late energy injection @xcite .    as shown by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", x - ray afterglows typically display a canonical light curve which is described by a very steep initial decay slope followed by a much shallower slope - usually referred to as the plateau phase. after this plateau phase we see the normal decay phase .",
    "the initial decay slope in the x - ray light curve always regards as the tail of the prompt emission phase @xcite .",
    "the plateau phase marks the beginning of the afterglow phase which is generally caused by external shocks when the jet starts interacting with the interstellar medium .",
    "s ability to observe grbs in soft x - rays within minutes after the explosion has lead to the discovery of flares in roughly 1/3 of all grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "not only revolutionized grb studies , but the large number of bursts covered with multi - wavelengths observation and redshift measurements allows for the first time a very detailed statistical analysis of grbs including cosmological studies of grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    although a connection between the prompt and the afterglow emission of a grb is expected according to the standard fireball model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the early days of  there was no evidence for such a connection @xcite except for the fluences in the prompt and afterglow emission . as shown by @xcite based on the observations of the grbs detected during the first two and half years of , there is a strong correlation between the fluence in the 15 - 150 kev band and the flux density of the x - ray afterglow emission .",
    "@xcite showed that the  bat and xrt light curves of the prompt and afterglow emission can be typically consistently connected .",
    "recently @xcite performed a statistical analysis of all -detected grbs until december 2010 and found clear correlations between the energetics of the prompt and the afterglow emission which also seem to suggest a universal scaling relation between short and long duration grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that x - ray afterglow luminosities at various times after the trigger correlate strongly with prompt emission properties , such as the isotropic energy @xmath4 and the peak energy in the high energy spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "previously , statistical analysis of the x - ray afterglow light curves were also performed by @xcite and @xcite . while @xcite focused on the automated analysis of  xrt light curves and found that about 40% of  bursts with x - ray observations are grbs with canonical light curves , @xcite did an analysis of the spectral and temporal parameters of the  x - ray data .",
    "they found that different phases of the light curves are all consistent with closure relations that explain the various states of grb afterglow light curves due to the jet geometry and physics , the environment around the grb , and the election density and cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "one of the best - known relations between grb properties is the relation of the peak energy in the @xmath6-ray spectrum @xmath5 with the isotropic energy @xmath4 or the collimation - corrected energy @xmath7 , the amati and ghirlanda relations , respectively @xcite .",
    "similar to these are the relations found by @xcite and @xcite between @xmath5 and the burst luminosity .",
    "although various efforts have been made to link the energetic properties of the prompt and afterglow emission of grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , what is still missing is to find correlations between prompt and afterglow properties , such as @xmath0 , break times , or spectral slopes .",
    "while this effort was hampered at the beginning of the  mission due to the small number of bursts @xcite , with more than 800 bursts that  has detected in almost 9 years in orbit ( august 2013 ) , the grb sample has grown allowing to find new relations among prompt and afterglow emission parameters .",
    "one motivation for this study comes from the relation we found between redshift and excess absorption seen in the observed x - ray spectra of grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "however , this method is rather limited in the sense that it can only say if a burst has a large amount of excess absorption then it is a low - redshift burst .",
    "our goal has been to find other means to distinguish between high and low redshift bursts more precisely and finally to estimate the redshift based on early available  data .",
    "hydrogen column density derived from x - ray observations was found to correlate using canonical correlation analysis @xcite with the properties of the prompt emission .",
    "the most sophisticated statistical analysis on  grbs to date has been performed by @xcite who applied a random forest algorithm in order to predict high redshift bursts . by looking through the data of -detected grbs we noticed several relations between prompt and afterglow properties which are not necessarily expected .",
    "in particular we noticed a strong relation of the bat @xmath0 and the 15 - 150 kev luminosity with the break times in the x - ray afterglow light curve @xcite .    here",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the whole -detected grb dataset and will show that indeed there are many correlations that establish a tight relation between the prompt and afterglow emission in grbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section[sample ] we describe the sample selection and the data analysis , in section[results ] we show the distributions and correlation analysis of the -detected grbs prompt and afterglow properties , followed by a discussion in section[discuss ] . throughout the paper spectral indices @xmath8 and light curve decay indices @xmath9 are defined as @xmath10 .",
    "all errors are 1@xmath11 unless stated otherwise .",
    "cosmological parameters like the luminosity distance or the comoving volume were derived from the cosmology calculator by @xcite .",
    "for all of these values we assumed the standard cosmology with @xmath12=71 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14=0.27 , and @xmath15=0.73 .",
    "by the end of august 2013  has discovered 804 bursts . of these",
    ", 40 grbs were discovered through ground processing and 9 burst through the  bat slew survey .",
    "there is also one burst with no data available . excluding these 50 bursts from the initial sample",
    "leaves a total of 754 -discovered onboard triggered bursts . in appendix[grb_catalog ] we present the whole catalog of these 754 grbs as a machine readable file that is available online .",
    "this file contains the grb name ,  bat trigger number , redshift , and bat and xrt measured observed parameters .",
    "a full list of these parameters is given in appendix[grb_catalog ] in table[grb_table ] .",
    "figure[grbs_year ] displays the number of onboard detected grbs per year ( blue triangles ) .",
    "the red circles display the number of grbs per year with spectroscopic redshift measurements . in 663 cases",
    "xrt observed the field of the grbs and 607 x - ray afterglows were detected ( 91% ) in 30 cases no x - ray afterglow was found although  was on the target with the xrt and uvot within 300 seconds after the trigger .",
    "xrt did not observe the remaining 97 bursts due to observing constraints by the sun , the moon , or the earth .",
    "the  uvot detected a total of 251 grb afterglows out of 655 uvot observations performed . in this paper , however , we focus on the high energy properties of the bursts and leave the uvot analysis for a later publication . crucial to the analysis of physical parameters of grbs are redshift measurements . up to 2013 august , 232 grbs out for the 754 grbs in our sample or their host galaxies have spectroscopic redshift measurements ( about 31% ) .",
    "burst redshifts were taken from gcn circulars and the grb redshift catalogues by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that in the pre-  era there were redshift measurements for only 43 bursts @xcite .    of the 754 grbs in our sample 63",
    "are short duration and 689 are long duration grbs ( one early grb did not had a @xmath16 measurement ) following the standard division at @xmath0=2s as defined by @xcite .",
    "this is a significantly lower percentage compared with the  25% found in the batse grb sample .",
    "the reason is purely a selection effect due to the lower energy range of the bat compared with batse . as we will see later",
    ", the 2s devision line is too long for  bat - discovered bursts ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray count rate light curves and spectra were derived from the grb repository website at the university of leicester @xcite .",
    "the light curves were fitted using multi - segment power law models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which period of flares , in particular at early times after the explosion , were excluded from the analysis . in almost all cases ( 90 - 90% )",
    "we made use of the leicester online light curve fitting routine which is used by the team to make predictions on the xrt count rate of an x - ray afterglow . in the remaining cases we fitted the light curves in xspec manually .",
    "for these light curves we converted the light curve file into pha and an rmf that can be read into xspec by applying the ftool command _",
    "flu2xsp _ to the light curve ascii file .    for most spectra",
    ", we used the photon counting mode data ( pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that primarily cover the afterglow phase .",
    "we extracted source and background spectra and auxiliary response files provided by the grb catalogue website at leicester .",
    "these data typically cover the entire afterglow phase .",
    "the windowed timing mode data at the beginning of the light curves are often contaminated by emission from flares which tend to be much harder than the afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "we did not rely on the automated fitting results on the grb catalogue website in leicester . in the majority of cases",
    "the automated routine uses a free fit ` intrinsic ' absorber which results in excess absorption with large uncertainties even though the spectrum is consistent with just the galactic absorption column density .",
    "therefore all spectra were analyzed manually . in september 2007 the substrate voltage on the  xrt detector",
    "was increased from 0 to 6v @xcite . accordingly , for all spectra we used the most current response files .",
    "for spectra before august 2007 we used the response file _ swxpc0to12s0_20070901v011.rmf _ and after the end of august 2007 the response file _",
    "swxpc0to12s6_20010101v013.rmf_. all data were fit to absorbed power law models in xspec @xcite .",
    "first we fit the data with the absorption parameter fixed to the galactic value derived from the hi maps by @xcite .",
    "if this model does not result in an acceptable fit , we thaw the absorption parameter to search for excess absorption above the galactic value as described in @xcite . for afterglows with spectroscopic redshifts",
    "we determine the intrinsic absorption column density at the redshift of the grb .",
    "the parameters measured from the bat data were derived from the bat grb analysis pages and bat refined circulars and gcn burst reports .",
    "whenever possible we also made use of the peak energy @xmath5 in the high energy spectrum of a burst given by primarily konus - wind @xcite and the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; * ? ? ? * ) . before the launch of _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , we primarily used the @xmath5 measurements by konus - wind and the suzaku wam published in gcn circulars .",
    "after the _ fermi _ launch , we used the _ fermi _ gbm measurements when available , which now exist for roughly 50% of all bursts after the _ fermi _ launch .    in the end",
    "we derive @xmath0 , the 15 - 150 kev photon spectral slope @xmath17 , and the 15 - 150 kev fluence from the bat , and the 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray spectral slope @xmath18 , the break times at the beginning and the end of the plateau phase @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the slope during the plateau phase @xmath21  and the normal decay slope @xmath22 . for bursts with spectroscopic redshift measurements the fluence was k - corrected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath0 , @xmath23 , and @xmath20 were transferred into the rest frame .",
    "the rest - frame 15 - 150 kev luminosity is the mean isotropic luminosity during the time @xmath24 = @xmath0/(1+z ) determined from the k - corrected fluence .",
    "a complete description of each parameter is given in appendix[parameters ] .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to establish new connections between grb prompt and afterglow emission properties .",
    "therefore we need to examine the dataset by means of statistics . in this section",
    "we will first present the distributions of the observed and rest - frame parameters of -detected grbs .",
    "in particular we will look at differences between short and long - duration grbs we will then look at bi - variate corrections among these parameters with the gaol of finding evidence for connections between grb prompt and afterglow phases .",
    "this is then followed by a principal component analysis in order to search for underlying properties that drive the observed parameters in grbs .",
    "the section closes with a discussion of the grb luminosity functions and looking into estimating the redshift of a burst including an update on the redshift - excess absorption relation @xcite .",
    "the mean , standard deviation and median of all -discovered grbs , as well as for long and short - duration grbs , and high redshift grb ( z@xmath254.0 ) are listed in table[grb_statistics ] .",
    "we included high - redshift bursts to this table in order to examine if these bursts appear to be somewhat special and have different properties than bursts at lower redshifts or bursts without redshift measurements . in this section",
    "we show the distributions of @xmath16 , the break times in the x - ray light curves , decay slopes , and redshifts .",
    "all other distribution are shown in appendix[distr_append ] . in figures[distr_t90_tb ] through [ distr_z ] the statistical analysis of the property distributions are visualized through three standard tools in data mining ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * histogram and kernel density estimator * box plot * q - q plot    we explain the purpose of these statistical tools in appendix[distr_append ] .",
    "figures[distr_t90_tb ] and [ distr_t90z_tbz ] display the distributions of the bat @xmath0 and the break times @xmath23 and @xmath20 before and after the plateau phase in the x - ray light curve .",
    "the observed times are displayed in figure[distr_t90_tb ] and the plots in figure[distr_t90z_tbz ] show the values shifted into the rest - frame .",
    "the median @xmath0 value for all -discovered grbs is 38s and for long grbs only , 46s .",
    "the density estimate of the @xmath0 distribution suggests that for -detected grbs we see a bimodal distribution , separating the bursts into short and long bursts , as had been suggested based on the batse results @xcite .",
    "the division between the two groups , however , appears to be at a shorter @xmath0 than with the baste detected bursts , in agreement with the results by @xcite : the observed @xmath0 distribution suggests that the devision line between short and long bursts detected by bat is on the order of 1s .",
    "these short bursts also appear clearly as outliers in the @xmath0 box diagram for all grbs . in the rest - frame ( as shown in figure[distr_t90z_tbz ] ) the median @xmath0 of all bursts ( with redshifts ) is 13.4s , 16.0s for long , and 0.27s for short bursts .",
    "although break times before the plateau phase of short and long bursts are all of the order of roughly 500s , there are significant differences in the break times after the plateau phase . while long grbs show breaks after the plateau phase in the observed frame at about 8400s after the trigger , short grbs show a median break time after the plateau of 300s . in the rest frame",
    "the break times are 150s and 3360s for the long bursts .",
    "these break times before and after the plateau phase are comparable to the values published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that from the relation between redshift and the length of the plateau phase as reported by @xcite one would naively expect short grbs to have longer plateau phases than long grbs as they occur ( as we will show later ) at lower redshifts .",
    "note , however , that for the short bursts we do not have enough bursts with redshift and break time measurements that will allow to state reliable numbers .",
    "figure[distr_ax ] displays distributions of the x - ray light curve decay slopes during and after the plateau phase @xmath21  and @xmath22  ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) .",
    "the distribution of decay slope during the plateau phase @xmath21  is almost gaussian with an extended wing towards the very flat end of the distribution ( see the q - q plot in figure[distr_ax ] ) note , although this phase is commonly called the ` plateau phase ' , the median decay slope of all bursts is of the order of @xmath21=0.6 and that there is a large scatter in the distribution of decay slopes ( @xmath11=0.44 ) .",
    "some plateau decay slopes can be relatively steep with @xmath21@xmath251.0 .",
    "our mean and median values of @xmath21  are slightly steeper than what has been found be @xcite and @xcite , 0.27 and 0.32 , respectively .",
    "one reason why we found a slightly steeper decay slope during the plateau phase can be that we accept even slopes with @xmath21@xmath251.2 ( see figure[distr_ax ] ) which is not the case in the ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sample .    the distribution of the ` normal ' decay slopes after the plateau is shown in the lower panel of figure[distr_ax ] .",
    "note again that the distribution of @xmath22is quite broad and a significant number of bursts have decay slopes that exceed @xmath22@xmath252.0 which is typically assumed to be a decay slope after a jet break , particularly for short - duration grbs .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of all grbs of @xmath22  is 1.55 and 0.73 and the median value is 1.38 , suggesting a non - gaussian distribution .",
    "the median decay slope during the normal decay phase for long grbs is 1.37 .",
    "note that there are three outliers in the @xmath22  distribution , which are all short grbs ( grbs 051210 , 120305a , and 120521a ) .",
    "all these decay slopes are extreme of the order of 7 or 8 . with the median values",
    "as discussed above and listed in table[grb_statistics ] we can construct a median grb x - ray afterglow light curve .",
    "figure[median_xrt_lc ] displays the observed median 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray flux and the rest - frame luminosity light curves ( left and right panel , respectively ) .",
    "the light curves were constructed by using the median values for the break times before and after the plateau phase and the decay slope @xmath21   and @xmath22 .",
    "we used the median values for the fluxes and luminosities at the break time after the plateau phase ( @xmath26 erg s@xmath13 @xmath27 and @xmath28 erg s@xmath13 ) as the normalization points of the light curve .",
    "the redshift distribution of the 232 -detected bursts with spectroscopic redshift measurements is shown in figure[distr_z ] .",
    "the mean redshift of all  bursts is z=2.03 and the median z=1.76 which is lower than for the bursts detected during the first two years of   operation ( z=2.30 ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite have studied the evolution of the mean redshifts of -detected grbs since 2005 and shown that the mean redshift of -discovered bursts has decreased over the course of the mission .",
    "there is a significant difference in the redshift distributions of short and long grbs , with short grbs being detected only at the lower end of the redhshift distribution .",
    "this is a selection effect . as shown by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , short bursts",
    "are less energetic than long bursts ( see also below ) which results in a lower fluence .",
    "the cause of the different energetics of short and long grbs is most likely the result of their different progenitors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ) which then results in different redshift distributions . as a consequence , short bursts which have lower",
    "energy appear to be undetectable at high redshifts .",
    "before we start any discussion on results of the correlation analysis from our sample we need to be aware of any selection biases in the sample that may lead to non - physical results .",
    "one of these selection biases is displayed in figure[fluence_t90 ] which shows the observed 15 - 150 kev fluence in the  bat and @xmath0 which seem to be very strongly correlated ( @xmath29=0.667 , @xmath30=22.85 ) .",
    "however , this is purely a selection effect driven by the detector properties .",
    "we only detect low - fluence bursts when their energy is released in a relatively short amount of time .",
    "if the energy is spread over a longer time span the signal will be dominated by noise and the bat will not be able to trigger on this event .",
    "this selection effect means that low fluence bursts have to be short in order to be detected , explaining the upper left part of the diagram .",
    "on the other hand the void at the lower right part of figure[fluence_t90 ] may be of physical nature .",
    "there are two effects here :    1 .   a highly energetic burst ( and high fluence burst )",
    "requires a certain amount of time to release the energy and 2 .   related to this ,",
    "short bursts generally speaking have lower luminosities / energies than long grbs ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "\\1 ) the reason why high fluence bursts are seen with longer @xmath0 may be that there is only some maximum amount of flux ( or luminosity ) that can be generated by the burst .",
    "therefore a high fluence burst would need a longer time span to release its energy than a low fluence burst .",
    "\\2 ) in order to detect a short burst with a high fluence requires that this burst occurs at close distances .",
    "for example the short grb with the highest fluence ( @xmath31 erg @xmath27 ) is grb 051221a @xcite with a redshift of z=0.547 , resulting in a luminosity distance of 3150 mpc . to detect this grb with a fluence of the order of @xmath32 erg @xmath27 it needs to occur within 390 mpc equivalent to a redshift of z=0.085 .",
    "although this is not impossible and  has detected a few bursts with redshifts lower than 0.085 ( 4 to be precise ) the probability of detecting a relatively luminous short burst like grb 051212a at such a low distance is low .",
    "this is mostly due to the the general space density of grbs and their luminosity functions ( see also section[lum_func ] ) and the much lower comoving volume at a redshift of 0.085 than at higher cosmological redshifts .",
    "having a less luminous burst explode and detect it with a fluence in the @xmath32 range requires an even closer distance .",
    "how does the @xmath0 - fluence selection effect affect other correlations ? we found a mild correlation between @xmath0 and the isotropic energy in the 15 - 150 kev bat band .",
    "however , this correlation may mostly been driven by this selection effect .",
    "another question that may raises concerns is whether @xmath0 really is a good parameter to describe a burst .",
    "as pointed out by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , @xmath0 is strongly detector dependent .",
    "this is similar to a hardness ratio which does not allow a direct comparison between different missions .",
    "however , as long as we use both parameters from samples using only data from the same detector it may not be a problem .",
    "still , for -bat grbs we typically use the 2s division line between short and long duration grbs as it was defined by @xcite for gamma - ray observatory batse - detected grbs which was operating at much higher energies than the  bat .",
    "however , as we have pointed out in section[distribution ] the division between  bat - detetced short and long duration grbs occurs at earlier times .",
    "it has been recently shown also by @xcite that the cutoff line at 2s between short and long duration grbs detected by the -bat is not a good choice and it is more appropriate for  discovered bursts to have the cutoff at around 0.8s .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section[short - long ] .",
    "there is another problem that has recently been pointed out by several authors : high - redshift bursts tend to have rather short @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "bursts like grb 090423 or grb 080913 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which are the grbs with the highest spectroscopically measured redshifts ( 8.2 and 6.7 ) , had @xmath0 of 8.0 and 10.3s , respectively , which in the rest - frame suggests that these maybe short bursts .",
    "however , the reason for these short @xmath0 may not be a physical property of the bursts , rather a consequence of the detector threshold . because the flux light curve of the prompt emission observed from a high - redshift burst appears to be fainter than that of a low - redshift burst on average , a detector triggers on the prompt emission later than for a low - redshift burst because the main part of the prompt emission light curve is below the detector threshold @xcite .",
    "we basically observe the tip of the iceberg of the prompt emission of high - redshift bursts where most of the prompt emission is lost in the noise .",
    "nevertheless , the short duration of the observed prompt emission is not a general property of high - redshift bursts ( e.g. grb 050904 which is a burst at the redshift of z=6.2 had a @xmath0 = 181.7s ) .",
    "the concern is how much does this threshold effect influence the results we found for our  grb sample ? if there is a significant effect on the sample we would expect to see a decrease of @xmath0 with increasing redshift .",
    "this relation is plotted for the observed and rest - frame @xmath0 in figure[z_t90 ] .",
    "however , we do not observe such an effect .",
    "therefore we conclude that although some high - redshift bursts appear to have rather short duration prompt emission due to the detector threshold this effect is not significant for the whole sample .",
    "nevertheless there is another concern regarding high - redshift bursts @xcite as we mentioned at the beginning of this subsection , the fluence and @xmath0 are strongly correlated because of how the bat triggers on bursts .",
    "although the mean and median fluences and @xmath0 of all grbs and high - redshift bursts are essentially the same ( table[grb_statistics ] ) this picture changes when looking at the rest - frame parameters : we do not find very long @xmath0 grbs at high redshifts and high - redshift bursts are significantly more luminous and energetic than compared with the total grb sample .",
    "the same selection bias that there are long grbs with low fluence also excludes long high - redshift grbs from detection .",
    "the problem here is that due to time - dilation ( @xmath33 ) a rest - frame long burst becomes even dramatically longer in the observed frame .",
    "this means that the fluence of these bursts will be smeared out over a longer time span with the consequence that due to the detector noise the burst remains undetected . in other words , in order to detect a grb with the  bat at high redshifts , its rest - frame @xmath0 needs to be relatively short and it has to be a highly energetic burst .",
    "consequently this means that the majority of high - redshift bursts are missed by the bat . as pointed out by @xcite this prediction , however ,",
    "also strongly depends on the star formation rate at high redshifts .      throughout this subsection",
    "we look at correlations between observed and rest - frame grb prompt and afterglow emission parameters .",
    "in particular we are interested in strong relations between prompt and afterglow properties .",
    "one of the goals is to be able to make predictions of the behavior of the x - ray afterglow based on prompt emission properties .",

    "this effect , however , becomes smeared out in the rest - frame .",
    "the reason that the percentage of short - duration grbs with spectroscopic redshift is significantly lower than in long - duration grbs , is simply because they are much more difficult to follow up due to their lower flux / fluence and faster decay slopes compared with long - duration grbs .",

    "we go a step beyond the energetics and ask what other prompt and afterglow properties are correlated .",

    "this is a real anti - correlation between the prompt luminosity and the afterglow emission light curve break times .",
    "this is not necessarily true , however , for the connection found by e.g. @xcite between the break time after the plateau phase @xmath57 and the luminosity at @xmath58 , which are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "the problem is that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not independent parameters . because the decay slope of the ` plateau ' phase in not 0 , a later break time will automatically result in a lower flux / luminosity .",

    "any possible physical cause for this relation can not be disentangled from the fact that at a later time a burst will automatically appear to be fainter than at earlier times .",
    "note that the anti - correlations between prompt emission luminosity and isotropic energy and break times in the x - ray afterglow light curve can be used as a diagnostic to determine if a redshift measured of a galaxy in the direction of the burst is actually associated with the burst or just a random galaxy in the line of sight .",
    "a good example here is grb 051109b @xcite .",
    "this burst has an observed @xmath63s and a fluence of @xmath64 erg @xmath27 @xcite and break times in the x - ray light curve at @xmath23=200s and @xmath20=1430s .",
    "@xcite reported of a galaxy in the direction of this burst and measured a redshift of z=0.080 .",

    "the answer is that this association is most unlikely . at the redshift of the galaxy",
    "the luminosity distance is @xmath65=360 mpc which results in a 15 - 150 kev luminosity @xmath66 erg s@xmath13 @xmath27 and an isotropic energy @xmath67 erg .",

    "z@xmath681.5 is of the order of a several percent .",
    "so far we have only looked at bivariate correlations and we have found strong correlations between grb prompt and afterglow properties .",
    "one step further is the statistical analysis in a multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "the goal here is to search for any underlying fundamental property that is driving these relation .",
    "one of the standard tools in multivariate analysis that may answer this question is the principal component analysis ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "the idea of a pca is to reduce the number of significant sample parameters to a small number of parameters that capture most of the variance in the data .",
    "for example , in agn , the measured parameters are primarily driven by the mass of the central black hole and the eddington ratio @xmath69 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in a mathematical sense , the pca searches for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a correlation coefficient matrix .",
    "a good description for the application of a pca in astronomy can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the reason why we do not include all properties as listed in table[correlation_tab_z ] is because some of these have obvious correlations , such as @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "the most dominant of these , eigenvector 1 , accounts for almost 40% of the variance .",
    "it strongly correlates with the 15 - 150 kev rest - frame luminosity and anti - correlates with all other parameters , except for the decay slope during the plateau phase , @xmath21 .",
    "this may suggest that eigenvector 1 in our sample presents the 15 - 150 kev luminosity . in order to test this hypothesis we excluded the 15 - 150 kev luminosity from the input parameters and ran another pca on the sample .",
    "the results of this pca are listed in table[pca_results2 ] .",
    "this analysis agrees with the first pca that included the 15 - 150 kev luminosity .    using the later analysis , we calculated the first eigenvector for each grb and plotted the eigenvector 1s vs. the 15 - 150 kev luminosity and isotropic energy as shown in figure[ev1_lum15_150 ] .",
    "if the conclusion , that grbs are primarily driven by their energetics is correct , then the eigenvector 1 - energy relation has to hold also for energies determined independently by other missions .",
    "we used the bolometric energies listed in @xcite for about 30 grbs .",
    "this relation is displayed in the right panel of figure[ev1_lum15_150 ] .",

    "the way we estimated these numbers is to take the number of -discovered bursts with spectroscopic redshift measurement per redshift interval and assume the same underlying redshift distribution for the remaining  bursts .",

    "the number of bursts with spectroscopic redshifts measurements is biased against high redshift bursts .",
    "therefore we can not necessarily assume that the redshift distribution of the  bursts without redshift measurements is the same as for those with redshift measurement .",
    "another attempt to tackle this problem is to have a look only at the space density of the most luminous bursts .",
    "this is shown in figure[grb_density ] . here",
    "we consider only those bursts who have a luminosity of @xmath89 erg s@xmath13 .",

    "this is similar to the `` cosmic downsizing '' that is known for bright quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this is true , then we should see this effect of `` cosmic downsizing '' also in a luminosity - redshift plot .",
    "the 15 - 150 kev luminosity vs. redshift is shown in figure[z_lum ] and indeed there are no bursts with @xmath91 erg s@xmath13 at redshifts less than 1.5 .",

    "* ) , similar to that of our grb sample .",
    "this result is consistent with what has been found by @xcite .",
    "the space density of grbs , thus decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "however , keep in mind that this may also be a selection effect . because high redshift bursts are those which are not detected in the uvot , often no one wants to take the risk of sacrificing valuable observing time on a burst that is simply too faint and not necessarily highly redshifted .",
    "as we see later in this discussion , bursts with redshift measurements tend to be brighter than those without redshift measurements",
    ". nevertheless , the result shown in figure[grb_density ] agrees with the cosmic star formation history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic redshift measurements exist for 232 -onboard - discovered bursts .",
    "the problem with obtaining grb redshifts is that a ) the afterglows are faint to begin with , often fainter than 20th mag in r and b ) they decay fast .",
    "so an optical observer has to decide quickly if it is worth spending valuable telescope time on a newly discovered burst .",
    "the capacity of detecting grb afterglows in the optical and near infrared either by spectroscopic of photoscopic measurements has significantly increased in recent years especially with the arrival of x - shooter at the eso vlt and grond at the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope in la silla @xcite .    in order to predict grb redshifts",
    "ideally one would look for a relation between a redshift dependent ( or distant - dependent ) parameter and a redshift - independent parameter .",
    "this can be based purely of selection effects . in the past",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that bursts with significant excess absorption column densities above the galactic value are low redshifts bursts .",
    "@xcite found an anti - correlation between the spectral lag times in the bat data and the isotropic luminosity .",
    "recently @xcite suggested a statistical method that applied a random forest technique to predict high redshift grbs .",
    "to date this is the most advanced method to predict if a burst is at high redshift based on  data .    let us start with an update on the redshift - excess absorption relation presented in @xcite .",

    "our new sample presented here contains more than 4 times as many bursts with spectroscopic redshifts measurements .",

    "equation 1 in @xcite would have predicted a redshift of @xmath946.6 , which , however , would have been still a high redshift burst .",
    "note also that the errors on the absorption column density for this burst are rather large and within the errors , grb 090423 is still within the prediction .    in order to obtain a better discriminator for high redshift bursts we have to extend our simple redshift - @xmath95 relation .",

    "this means that if we calculate eigenvector 1 for a newly discovered burst based on the bat input parameters , we should be able to predict the isotropic energy in the bat band .",
    "nevertheless there is a lot of scatter in this relation which prevents a clear statement of the redshift of the burst .",
    "we examined this plot a bit further on selected high and low redshift bursts .",
    "these are shown as red circles and blue triangles , respectively .",
    "clearly they form distinct groups in this diagram . for a given eigenvector 1 ,",
    "high redshift burst show larger isotropic energies than low - redshift bursts .",
    "if we can find another discriminator between low and high redshift bursts then we know in which group the newly discovered grb belongs and we can use the eigenvector 1 of this burst in order to get an estimate of the isotropic energy . with this estimate and the knowledge of the 15 - 150 kev fluence , we can then estimate the distance to the burst and its redshift .",
    "discriminators for high and low redshift bursts are : a ) does the x - ray spectrum show strong excess absorption ? and b ) is the afterglow detected in the uvot or not ? .",
    "table[grb_statistics_redshift ] lists the mean , standard deviation , and median of observed prompt and afterglow properties of low ( z@xmath681.0 ) , intermediate ( 1.0@xmath68z@xmath683.5 ) and high redshift bursts ( z@xmath253.5 ) . besides that",

    "there is no change in the spectral slopes from the plateau phase to the normal decay phase , and in most of the cases the plateau flux joins smoothly with the normal afterglow @xcite . on the other hand the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath71 points to the fact that the plateau is of internal origin , related to the central engine of the bursts .",
    "the fact that the spectrum does not change during @xmath71 , points to it either being determined by a geometric or a hydrodynamic effect .",
    "a similar correlation for a much smaller number of grbs was found by @xcite .",

    "one of the most discussed models is the refreshed shocks @xcite : at the forward shock either by a smoothly decaying central engine luminosity ( @xmath104 ) or by a distribution of instantaneously ejected masses with a distribution of lorentz factors down to few tens @xcite .",
    "models for the plateau phase include change in microphysical parameters with time @xcite , emission by a distribution of ejected lorentz factors @xcite , a strong reverse shock contribution @xcite or anisotropic jet structure @xcite ,    a class of models explaining the plateau phase invokes energy injection from magnetars @xcite into the forward shock , similar to the refreshed shocks .",
    "these can reproduce the flattening in the x - ray light curve @xcite . the supply of energy is provided by the spin down energy of a newly born magnetar . in these scenarios the collapse to a black hole",
    "is delayed by the magnetar phase @xcite . in relation to short grbs , the injection of spin down energy by a magnetar and thus the plateau phase , can be linked to gravitational wave emission @xcite . in these models",
    "the prompt emission is tentatively produced by local processes to the outflow ( e.g. magnetic dissipation or shocks close to the magnetar wind photosphere @xcite ) , which can not be readily related to the length of the plateau phase in the afterglow .    *",
    "the most straightforward way of interpreting the @xmath105 correlation is the model by @xcite which addresses both the prompt emission and the plateau phase . in this model",
    "the x - ray luminosity is driven by the mass accretion rate .",
    "they envisage a massive star with a core and an envelope .",
    "the part of the core collapses to form a black hole . accreting the remainder of",
    "the core produces the prompt phase . from the outermost parts of the core until the inner part of the envelope the density drops suddenly , producing the steep decay part .",
    "the envelope is accreted subsequently .",
    "the duration of accretion is roughly the fallback time , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the mass within radius r , generally dominated by the black hole mass .",
    "thus @xmath0 corresponds to the core accretion time and @xmath108 to the envelope accretion in this model .",
    "the correlation results in @xmath109 .",
    "the drawback of this scenario is that it predicts a steep decay at the end of the shallow decay phase corresponding to the outer radius of the star .",
    "this is only observed in a few cases . *",
    "a natural explanation can be given to the correlation if the reverse shock is at the origin of the plateau .",
    "the details of such an interpretation are described , for example in @xcite .",
    "the prompt duration ( @xmath0 ) is defined as the active phase of the central engine ( e.g. in a photospheric model ) and this also defines the width of the ejecta .",
    "the plateau duration in this scenario corresponds to the ejecta crossing time by the reverse shock which is then proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity l anti - correlates with the plateau break time @xmath108 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of an approximate energy conservation . for",
    "a universal ratio between the prompt and plateau luminosity , the increase in energy emission in the prompt phase will result in a smaller emitted energy in the plateau , similar if we had a constant energy reservoir .",
    "there is a similar observed anti - correlation between the luminosity at the end time of the plateau @xcite which can be explained in the magnetar model .",
    "we can tentatively understand this anti - correlation within the framework of the magnetar model as follows : both the prompt and afterglow luminosity depend on some positive power of the magnetic field ( e.g. @xmath110 ) while the spin - down timescale , which is related to @xmath111 is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "this would qualitatively explain the anti - correlation .",
    "other properties such as the neutron star radius or the rotation period would act to strengthen the anti - correlation .    as we will see below ( section[pca_discuss ] ) , it seems that these ( anti)-correlations are primarily driven by the luminosity / energy of the burst .",
    "what is interesting among these relations are those between the decay slopes of the x - ray afterglow emission with the rest - frame @xmath5 and the energy and luminosity of the burst . while the energy , luminosity and rest - frame @xmath5 are all redshift ( or distance ) dependent , the decay slopes are not . in principle",
    "we do a have a redshift indicator .",
    "however , at this point we can not use the slopes @xmath21  and @xmath22  as redshift indicators due to the large scatter in these relations ( see figure[eiso_ax ] ) . as we will discuss later",
    ", machine learning techniques may be the solution to take advantage of these redshift indication relations .      using the log @xmath113 , log @xmath49 , @xmath21 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  as representatives of the prompt and afterglow emission of a subsample of 175 grbs with canonical x - ray light curves , the results from the pca show that the first two eigenvectors account for more than 60% of the variance in the sample .",
    "we can see directly that eigenvector 1 represents the luminosity and/or the isotropic energy of the grb in the rest frame 15 - 150 kev band ( figure[ev1_lum15_150 ] ) .",
    "this is somewhat expected .",
    "what is interesting to note is that although using different input parameters ( see section[pca ] ) , @xcite came to a similar conclusion .",
    "the question that remains is what actually determines the luminosity and energy release of a burst ?    are grbs with spectroscopic redshifts , in particular those used in the pca , representative of the whole sample ?",
    "in other words can conclusions that we draw from the statistical analysis on this sub - sample of bursts , including pca , be applied to the rest of the sample which does not have redshift measurements ?",
    "this is an important question , because as we have discussed earlier , the entire sample is driven by selection biases . in order to test this",
    ", we need to look at the statistics between the grb samples with and without spectroscopic measurements .",
    "we have mentioned already in section[selection ] , grbs are affected by selection effects , primarily by the bat properties . as pointed out by @xcite selection biases",
    "become even more important when dealing with high - redshift bursts . in order to answer this question we looked at the observed parameters of the samples for grbs with and without spectroscopic redshift measurements and those used in the pca .",
    "the mean , standard deviations , and median of each sample are listed in table[grbs_z_noz ] .",
    "all parameters like @xmath0 or @xmath21  have very similar means , standard deviations , and medians and suggest that these are all drawn from the same underlying distribution . however , this is not true for the observed 15 - 150 kev fluence and the peak energy @xmath5 . here",
    "the distributions seem to be different : grbs with spectroscopic redshifts have on average a fluence twice as high when compared with grbs with no redshift measurements .",
    "we performed kolmogorov - smirnov tests on the samples with grbs with and without spectroscopic redshift measurements and found that indeed the distributions in the fluence and @xmath5 of these two samples are drawn from different populations .",
    "for the fluence we found d=0.2166 with a probability @xmath114 of a random result and for @xmath5 d=0.30 and @xmath115 . clearly , the bursts with redshift measurements are biased towards brighter grbs .",
    "as shown in table[grb_statistics_redshift ] , this is really a selection effect between burst with and without redshift and not driven by different redshift intervals .",
    "what this means is that these grbs also more likely to have optical counterpart and as a result will be observed preferentially by ground - based observers .",
    "this becomes apparent when looking at the uvot detections in both samples : while 2/3 of all grbs with spectroscopic redshift measurements have uvot detections , this is only true for 17% of the grbs without spectroscopic redshift measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that otherwise the observed parameters of the bursts are very similar suggests that they are drawn from the same population .",
    "if this is true then the correlations found among the rest - frame parameters in bursts with redshifts also apply to those bursts without redshift measurements .",
    "in particular , the conclusion of our pca that the energetics is the main driver in grb properties does therefore apply to all grbs .      as we have seen from the pca ,",
    "properties of the prompt and afterglow phases seem to be driven primarily by energetics .",
    "this means the largest relative scatter in the multidimensional data cloud can be accounted for by luminosity . in other words , if we know the luminosity , we have accounted for a high percentage of the information otherwise attainable .",
    "also the luminosity changes by 5 orders of magnitude , more than any other parameter .",
    "there are two viable mechanisms for extracting luminosity from the black hole - accretion disk system    if the luminosity is extracted from the central engine by the blandford znajek @xcite mechanism , this means @xmath116 , where @xmath80 is the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath117 is the magnetic field threading the central engine , and @xmath118 is its mass . in current models",
    "the mass can have a spread of one order of magnitude , the rotational parameter is ideally around @xmath119 for maximum efficiency , and it can not introduce a large amount of variance . thus the magnetic field has to account to the bulk of the variance . if the jet is launched by neutrino emission from the disk , the luminosity scales as : @xmath120 @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the large variance in luminosity can be accounted by variation in the accretion rate by two orders of magnitude .    however , what is really behind all those properties , or in other words , what determines the energetics of a burst ?",
    "part of the problem is that for all correlations mentioned here we measured isotropic energies and luminosities .",
    "we know , however , that in a grb the outflow is collimated .",
    "this may explain the anti - correlation we have found between the luminosity and energy of the prompt emission with ( rest - frame ) @xmath0 and break times before and after the plateau phase .",
    "navely one would assume that the more energetic a burst is the longer its @xmath0 and the plateau phase start and end times .",
    "however , as we have shown this seem to be not the case .",
    "we do , however , for all of our correlations assume isotropic energies / luminosities .",
    "what may be the case is that bursts which short @xmath0 and break times before and after the plateau phase are those bursts which outflows are highly collimated .",
    "correcting for collimation means that the total energy release of these bursts is significantly lower than in burst which are less collimated .",
    "this means that if calibrated @xmath0 and the break times can be used as a measure of the jet opening angle .",
    "this relation then would be somewhat similar to the jet opening angle - jet break times relation found by @xcite for optical and radio afterglows .",
    "what this means is that bursts which large opening angles are the bursts which are intrinsically less energetic and show the shorter @xmath0 and break times .",
    "this is exactly what we see in the second eigenvector in our pca .",
    "the second eigenvector may be the jet opening angle .",
    "a connection between the x - ray spectral slope and the decay slopes in the light curve is expected from for example the closure relations @xcite . the big question remaining is , can we predict the behavior of the x - ray afterglow , assuming a canonical behavior , based on properties measured from the prompt emission .",
    "if this is possible then it gives us a handle on how to plan future observations of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath0 and the break times before and after the plateau in the x - ray afterglow light curves are strongly correlated .",
    "so one prediction we can do is that bursts with a short @xmath0 will show early breaks in the x - ray light curves .",
    "although this correlation is statistically very strong ( @xmath37 ) , the scatter in the relation is large , making it impossible to derive a precise prediction of the break times based on @xmath0 .",
    "we have also found that the photon spectrum measured in the prompt emission in the bat 15 - 150 kev band in strongly anti correlated with the x - ray afterglow decay slopes .",
    "so , if for example the 15 - 150 kev hard x - ray photon index @xmath17 is flat , the the x - ray afterglow light curve decay slopes are most likely to be steep and vice versa .",
    "again , this seem to be linked to the energetics of the burst .",
    "more luminous / energetic bursts have flatter hard x - ray spectra ( see figure[lum_gamma_bx ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we do not find a clear correlation between the luminosity and energy and the decay slopes in the x - ray light curves .",
    "the correlation between @xmath4 and the decay slope in the plateau phase @xmath21  is mild ( @xmath121=0.240 , @xmath122and the ` normal ' decay slope @xmath22  with @xmath121=0.306 and @xmath123 ( see table[correlation_tab_z ] ) .",
    "so , the x - ray afterglows of more energetic bursts decay faster than those of less energetic bursts .",
    "this is somewhat the opposite than what one would normally expect .",
    "the reason here again may be the opening angle of the burst .",
    "because we do all our correlations based on @xmath4 we do not know , however , what the opening angle is and what the real energy release is .",
    "the question is : do the properties of the prompt emission of a burst determine the fate of the afterglow emission ( assuming that the afterglow follows a canonical light curve ) . or in other words , can we use the properties measured from the prompt emission to make predictions of the behavior of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "how will the light curve evolve ?",
    "one of the strongest correlations has been found between the 15 - 150 kev @xmath0 and the break times at the beginning and end of the plateau phase in the x - ray light curve .",
    "this correlation gives us a rough estimate when these breaks happen based on @xmath0 .",
    "a burst with a short @xmath0 will have breaks in the x - ray light curve earlier than a burst with the long @xmath0 .",
    "we have also found an anti - correlation between the 15 - 150 kev spectral slope @xmath17 and the decay slopes in the x - ray light curve : a burst with a soft 15 - 150 kev spectrum will show flatter decay slopes than a burst with a harder 15 - 150 kev spectrum .",
    "last but not least there are strong correlations between the fluence in the 15 - 150 kev bat energy band and the decay slopes in the x - ray light curves .",
    "this results in that grbs with high fluence decay faster in x - rays than grbs with lower fluence .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 shown in figure[distr_t90_tb ] from bat discovered grbs suggests a bimodal distribution such has been found from batse bursts @xcite .",
    "however , due to the lower energy window of the  bat , the detection rate of short grbs is significantly lower and the devision line between short and long - duration grbs appears to be at shorter times compared with batse bursts . as pointed out by @xcite the devision between collapsar ( long grbs ) and non - collapsar ( short grbs ) is driven by the different physical processes involved in these types .",
    "@xcite suggested that a devision between short and long bursts at about 0.8s is more suitable for -detected bursts .",
    "the observed @xmath0 distribution ( figure[distr_t90_tb ] ) seem to support this time .",
    "as already found from baste bursts , short grb tend to show harder spectra than long grbs allowing another parameter to distinguish between the two classes .",
    "as shown in the distributions of the 15 - 150 kev photon indices @xmath17 shown for long and short grbs in figure[distr_gamma_bx ] we do see the same effect in -detected short and long grbs as well .",
    "figure[gamma_t90 ] displays the relations between observed @xmath0 and @xmath17 , suggesting that there are two distinct groups in that diagram . as pointed out by @xcite , short grbs",
    "appear to be less energetic compared with long grbs .",
    "the consequence is that the fluence of short grbs is significantly lower than that of long grbs ( figure[distr_fluence ] ) .    to find out if a burst belongs to one class of the other , one method that has been suggested in spectral lag analysis ( [ e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another method is to apply statistical tools to the n - dimensional dataset and classify a grb as a short of a long - duration grb using cluster analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use the observed @xmath0 , 15 - 150 kev fluence , and @xmath6 ( all normalized ) to span a three - dimensional space .",
    "we then run a hierarchical cluster analysis with centroid linkage on this dataset .",
    "besides outliers which consist of grb 060202b which has an extremely soft 15 - 150 kev x - ray spectrum @xcite , and grb 060218 which is the low - luminosity grb associated with supernova sn 2006aj @xcite , we see two main groups : group 1 which consists of 685 members , and group 2 consisting of 55 members - all short grbs . there is a small third group which consists of grbs 050416a , 050819 , 050824 , 060428b 061218 , 080520 , and 130608a .",
    "all these bursts are x - ray flashes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this group has previously being suggested to be an intermediate duration grb group by e.g @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure[cluster_corr ] displays where these grb groups appear in @xmath0 - @xmath17 , @xmath0 - fluence , and @xmath17 - fluence diagrams . in these diagrams",
    "we displays group 1 as black crosses , group 2 as blue triangles and group 3 as red circles .",
    "these diagrams suggest that there is still some overlap between the groups , although the xrfs ( group 3 ) are clearly distinct in the @xmath124 and @xmath17-fluence diagrams .",
    "however , these diagrams are just two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional space that is spanned by @xmath0 , @xmath17 and the 15 - 150 kev fluence . in order to really see if the three groups are disjoint we need to perform an axis transformation in the same way as it was done for the pca .",
    "therefore we performed a pca in the three parameter space and calculated the first two eigenvectors for each burst .",
    "this diagram is shown in figure[cluster_ev1_ev2 ] .",
    "clearly short and long grbs and xrfs occupy different areas in this diagram : short grbs have low eigenvector 1 and high eigenvector 2 .",
    "xrfs on the other hand have very high eigenvector 2s .",
    "we can use this diagram in order to determine if a burst with a border line @xmath0 is a short or a long duration grb . in appendix[long_short ] we give the equations to determine where on the eigenvector 1 - eigenvector 2 diagram ( figure[cluster_ev1_ev2 ] ) a burst lies based on its observed bat properties .",
    "what this analysis also shows is that the previously considered short bursts grb 050724 and grb 051221a ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) are long grbs .",
    "other grbs that were considered short burst in our previous analysis using the 2s cutoff line are : grbs 070809 , 071227 , 080426 , 080905 , 081024 , 090426 , 100724a , 120403a , and 121226a .",
    "these bursts however , need to be classified as long grbs . on the other hand ,",
    "what our analysis also found were short grbs with an observed @xmath0 of 2.6 and 5.2s , grbs 081016b and 110726a , respectively .",
    "although their @xmath0 is significantly longer than the 0.8s that we suggest from our analysis consistent with the results by @xcite .",
    "these burst can be classified as short bursts due to their low fluence of the order of @xmath125 erg @xmath27 and hard x - ray spectra with @xmath17=0.79 and 0.64 , respectively .      as for the luminosity functions we noticed a steepening of the slope for the higher luminosity part of the luminosity function with increasing redshift .",
    "however , one has to be very careful with drawing conclusions from these findings .",
    "the redshift distribution of grbs is strongly biased against high redshift bursts , due to selection effects . as mentioned above ,",
    "bursts without redshift measurements are drawn from a fainter population than bursts with redshift measurements . as also pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the  redshift sample is far from being complete . in order to obtain a complete sample",
    ", @xcite proposed to use only bursts with high peak photon flux in the bat band .",
    "this is not true for all  bursts with redshift measurements . because we do have a bias against grbs with low fluence",
    ", the sample of bursts with redshift measurements is biased against high redshift bursts due to their typically lower fluence .",
    "while the selection effect of grbs with redshift measurements can explain the steep decay in the grb rate at higher redshifts as shown in figure[grb_rate ] , it does not explain the lower rate of bright grbs in the low redshift universe .",
    "while the smaller comoving volume for the universe with z@xmath681 may explain part of this effect , it does not explain the whole picture .",
    "the comoving volume of the universe with z@xmath681 is 153 gpc@xmath90 , it is 453 gpc@xmath90 in the redshift interval between z=1 and 2 , and about 250 gpc@xmath126 in the redshift intervals between z=2 and 4 in z=0.5 intervals .",
    "another effect maybe metallicity and the evolution of the star formation rate .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the star formation rate in spiral galaxies peaks at a redshift of about 3 , which is consistent with the grb rate shown in figure[grb_rate ] .",
    "the conclusion here is that in the local universe only a smaller number of very massive stars is formed that will then end as a grb , while at earlier epochs the rate of very massive stars has been higher .",
    "last but not least we raise the question whether we can make rough predictions on the x - ray light curve behavior based on prompt emission properties ?",
    "can we use any relation between observed burst properties with redshift to make predictions on the possible redshift of the burst ?",
    "we initially did this with the relation we found between the excess absorption in the x - ray afterglow x - ray spectrum @xcite : grbs with high excess absorption column density above the galactic value are low redshift bursts .",
    "we found similar relations between the bat photon index @xmath96 and the observed 15 - 150 kev fluence and redshift : grbs with steep @xmath96 ( @xmath252.0 ) and high fluence ( @xmath127 erg s@xmath13 @xmath27 ) are only seen in bursts with redshifts @xmath128 .",
    "again , we can only discriminate low - redshift grbs by their observed properties .",
    "one step further is the method we described at the end of section[redshift ] , where we use a pca to determine an eigenvector1 of a burst ( see also appendix[z_predict ] ) based on the observed bat parameters @xmath16 , fluence and @xmath17 .",
    "there is still strong scatter in this relation which still needs independent redshift discriminators .    as we have shown in the discussion about the correlation analysis ,",
    "most promising are the relations between the energy / luminosity of the grb s prompt emission and the decay slopes in the x - ray afterglow light curves .",
    "this , however , requires that the burst has to be observed until the decay slopes can be measured , which typically means at least several hours after the burst for plateau phase as a minimum .",
    "so far no secure discriminator has been found for high - redshift bursts . our plan is to apply machine learning techniques to the data set in order to obtain better redshift predictions based on observed grb properties measured from  data , similar to what has been shown by @xcite .",
    "what is really needed is a relation between a redshift - independent parameter such as @xmath17 and redshift - dependent parameters such as energy or luminosity .",
    "the main result of our statistical study of -discovered grbs is that we found new evidence that the grb prompt and afterglow emission are linked .",
    "this result is supported by the following findings :    * the bat @xmath0 and the break times in the x - ray light curve before and after the plateau phase are strongly correlated ( sections,[correlation ] ) .",
    "bursts with longer @xmath0 tend to show later breaks in their x - ray afterglow light curves .",
    "this is a statistically highly significant result , suggesting a physical relationship between the high energy prompt and soft x - ray afterglow emission .",
    "these correlations appear to be strong in the observed as well as in the rest - frame . *",
    "the hard x - ray photon index @xmath17 of the prompt emission strongly anti - correlates with the decay slopes in the x - ray afterglow light curves .",
    "the observed fluence in the 15 - 150 kev bat energy range anti - correlates with the decay slopes in x - rays .",
    "together with the @xmath0 - @xmath129 correlations these relations can be used to predict the behavior of the x - ray afterglow with a canonical light curve based on prompt emission parameter measurements . *",
    "the principal component analysis shows that the prompt and afterglow emission are driven primarily by the luminosity and/or isotropic energy release of the burst ( sections[pca ] , [ pca_discuss ] ) . *",
    "a cluster analysis on the observed -bat parameters shows that short and long grbs can be well - separated and that the division between short and long - duration grbs detected by the bat is less than 1s . * in addition",
    "we identified a third group in the cluster analysis : xrfs * the large number of -detected bursts with redshift measurements allows to do preform grb cosmology ( sections[lum_func ] , [ lum_func_discuss ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the grb luminosity functions at different redshift intervals shows that the slope of the high - luminosity end of the luminosity function becomes steeper with increasing redshift . the density of high luminous grbs @xmath130 erg s@xmath13 rate peaks at a redshift of about z=3 and the results suggest a cosmic downsizing of grbs at lower redshifts , similar to what has been observed for quasars .",
    "the peak of this grb density is at a redshift of @xmath1312.7 which agrees with the peak of the cosmic quasar density and the star formations rate history , suggesting a close connection grbs - star formation and quasar evolution . *",
    "the detection of a grb is strongly depends on the bat detection characteristics ( section[selection ] ) .",
    "this is primarily a mixture of the length of the burst and the fluence .",
    "we can not detect very long bursts with low fluence . *",
    "observed bat parameters can be used to get a rough estimate of a burst redshift . * the statistical analysis presented in the paper can only be the beginning of data mining the rich  grb data set . in the future we need to look into the analysis of the datasets including survival statistics to take upper and lower limits , e.g. for the break times in the x - ray light curves into account .",
    "another important task in the future will be to develop a support vector machine analysis that will allow to make predictions on the x - ray afterglow light curve and its behavior based on prompt emission properties .",
    "last but not least we need to examine the possibility of estimating redshift predictions similar to what has been done by @xcite .",
    "ultimately it is important that ground - based observes increase the number of afterglows for which they obtain spectroscopic data to measure redshifts . only with redshifts and therefore distance measurements we are able to derive the intrinsic physical properties of the bursts .",
    "we would like to thank all observers at ground - based optical telescopes for their effort to obtain redshifts of the  afterglows .",

    "in other words , bursts with steep bat photon indices tend to be less luminous than bursts with flatter @xmath96 .",
    "note that short duration grbs do not follow this anti - correlation .",
    "table[correlation_tab_z ] lists the correlations of all bursts , including short bursts .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath162 becomes sightly weaker for all grbs .",
    "although this anti - correlation is a relation between a redshift dependent parameter ( @xmath17 ) and a redshift independent parameter ( @xmath162 ) , grbs still can not be used as standard candles . not only is the scatter in the relation quite large , but @xmath162 is not independent of @xmath17 because we used @xmath17 as an input parameter in the k - correction .",
    "now lets see how @xmath17 and @xmath18  depend on the 15 - 150 kev energy release .",
    "these relations are displayed in the lower panels in figure[lum_gamma_bx ] where @xmath17 anti - correlates strongly with the isotropic energy in the 15 - 150 kev band @xmath195 ( @xmath121=0.492 , @xmath264=8.268 , @xmath37 for the 216 long grbs .",
    "again , as listed in table[correlation_tab_all ] the relation becomes weaker for all grbs .",
    "as for the 0.3 - 10 kev spectral slope @xmath18 , this is only a weak trend with @xmath121=-0.177 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 for the long grbs ( 215 ) .",
    "figure[lum_t90 ] displays the relation between the rest - frame @xmath113 and the luminosity in the 15 - 150 kev band . for the whole grb sample we found a spearman rank order correlation coefficient of @xmath121=0.290 and a student s t - test of @xmath264=4.580 with a probability of @xmath267 ( 231 grbs ) however , if we only look at the long grbs in the sample with spectroscopic redshifts ( 216 grbs ) , this correlation becomes even stronger with @xmath121=0.420 , @xmath264=6.777 , and @xmath37 .",
    "this relation suggests a strong anti - correlation with high luminosity bursts having shorter @xmath0 .",
    "however , keep in mind that the luminosity and @xmath0 are not independent parameters .",
    "the luminosity was calculated by @xmath268 so bursts with longer @xmath0 will have lower luminosities if we assume that their isotropic energies are somewhat similar .",
    "although the @xmath0 - luminosity relation looks like a significant correlation it may not be a physical relation .",
    "if more energetic bursts have really shorter @xmath0 then we should expect such a relation between the isotropic energy in the 15 - 150 kev band and @xmath0 .",
    "this is , however , a weak correlation with @xmath121=+0.197 and @xmath264=3.044 with @xmath269 of a random distribution .",
    "this relation , however , is driven by the short bursts .",
    "when applying this relation to only long bursts , the correlation disappears completely .",
    "in section [ redshift ] we showed that it may be possible to determine the 15 - 150 kev @xmath4 based on the observed -bat parameter .",
    "the relations from the pca as described in section[redshift ] are shown in the the eigenvector 1 - @xmath4 diagram , figure[ev1_eiso ] . in order to place a new grb onto this digram we give the equations of the normalized bat parameters @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and fluence below :    @xmath270    @xmath271    @xmath272",
    "now we can calculate eigenvector 1 based on the pca performed on the long grbs with spectroscopic redshift measurements :    @xmath273",
    "in this section we give the relations that will allow the reader to place a new grb in the eigenvector 1 - eigenvector 2 diagram , figure[cluster_ev1_ev2 ] as described in section[long - short ] .",
    "we first list the equation for the normalized @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and fluence :"
