    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary and a secondary that transfers mass to it through an accretion disk around the white dwarf",
    ". their brightness can change by large factors ( several millions ) during nova outbursts , which are due to thermonuclear runaways of the hydrogen - rich material that has accreted onto the white dwarf .",
    "the power spectra of cvs display several different periodicities which are attributed to the orbital period , white dwarf spin period ( in the case of magnetic cvs ) and superhumps ( which are photometric modulations near , but not at , the orbital period ) among others . among magnetic cvs , intermediate polars ( ips ) are moderately strong x - ray sources ( @xmath510@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ) , in which accreting material is magnetically channeled and shock - heated in the accretion column , producing high energy radiation as it cools before reaching the white dwarf surface .",
    "strong x - ray modulation is observed at the spin period , likely due to self - occultation of the accretion column by the white dwarf s body and/or phase - dependent absorption by pre - shock material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nova centauri 1986 ( v842  cen ) underwent its latest nova outburst in february 1986 and took 48 days to decline its brightness by 3 magnitudes , which suggests that it was a moderately fast nova @xcite .",
    "@xcite imaged the nova ejecta in 1998 using h@xmath8 and [ o iii]@xmath95007 narrowband filters .",
    "the ejecta show a fairly spherical shape in both filters ( 5.6@xmath10 6.0@xmath11 ) .",
    "given this information , therefore , nothing is particularly peculiar about this nova .",
    "however , optical photometry observations in 2008 overturned this picture when a fast pulsation of 57 seconds was discovered by @xcite and attributed to the spin period of the white dwarf , which would make v842  cen a member of the ip class .",
    "this finding has strong implications : its white dwarf would be the fastest rotator currently known in a nova remnant ; and , its symmetric shell morphology would now present a puzzle , since a magnetic field anchored to a rapidly rotating white dwarf would be likely to produce asymmetric ejecta shapes during a nova event @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we show the results of an xmm-@xmath0 x - ray and optical observation aimed to search for the 57  s spin period discovered by @xcite and thus confirm the ip nature of v842  cen . in section [ sec :",
    "data ] we present the details of the observation and data processing , while in section [ sec : results ] we show the results obtained from the timing and spectral analysis .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we observed v842  cen with the xmm-@xmath0 _ observatory _ on 2011 february 24 for 56.9 ks using the epic instrument , operated in full window mode with the medium thickness filter and the optical monitor ( om ) in fast mode . after removing events at periods with high flaring particle background using a 3@xmath12 clipping method ,",
    "the resulting exposure time reduced to 49.8 ks .",
    "the source spectra and light curves were accumulated from circular regions of 32@xmath11 and 20@xmath11 , respectively , centered on v842  cen ( @xmath13=14h 35 m 52.55s , @xmath14=-57@xmath15 37@xmath16 35.3@xmath11 ) .",
    "the background spectra and light curves were extracted from a source - free region on the same chip taken within a circle of 40@xmath11 radius .",
    "the total number of counts in the source region in the pn , mos1 and mos2 cameras was 5354 which includes 735 counts from background .",
    "we used the @xmath17 and @xmath18 to build the redistribution matrices and ancillary responses , respectively .",
    "the resulting x - ray spectra were grouped with a minimum of 15 counts per energy bin . for timing analysis",
    ", we converted photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter using the sas task @xmath19 .",
    "the exposure times in the om filters were 16594 , 16599 and 16596 seconds for the v , u and b respectively .",
    "the om light curves were reprocessed using the script ` omfchain ` with time bin size of 0.5 s.",
    "for the x - ray data , we used the event arrival times and rayleigh statistics ( @xmath20 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) to search for periods in the frequency range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total on - source time of 49.8 ks , @xmath25 is the epic camera readout time ( 73 ms ) and @xmath26 is the oversampling factor , which we set equal to 1,000 .",

    ", we also fit the spectrum with models successfully applied to cooling accretion shock columns , in which the temperature distribution depends on the cooling mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum can be modeled with an isobaric cooling flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the ` mkcflow ` model ( with the @xmath45 parameter equal 2 , meaning that the model spectrum used the @xmath39 emissivities ) modified by a simple absorber ( ` wabs ` ) .",
    "the model fit ( @xmath36=260 , 267 d.o.f . ) results in a maximum plasma temperature @xmath2 kev , a minimum temperature @xmath46 kev , absorption column @xmath4710@xmath42 @xmath43 , abundance @xmath48 in solar units and mass accretion rate @xmath49[10@xmath50=7@xmath51/yr ( @xmath52/1.3 kpc)@xmath53 gill98 .    at the accretion shock front ,",
    "the shock temperature is proportional to the square of the free - fall velocity , which in turn is set by the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "thus the white dwarf mass can be derived from the value of @xmath54 obtained from fitting the spectrum with a cooling flow model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the value of @xmath54 obtained from our fit implies @xmath55=0.88 m@xmath56 , where @xmath55 is the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "the nature of v842  cen remains unclear .",
    "optical data obtained in 2008 show modulations at 56.825 s and 3.780@xmath10.004 h @xcite .",
    "these authors attributed the shorter period to the white dwarf spin .",
    "the presence of sidebands at 56.598 and 57.054 s suggested that the orbital period should be at 3.94 h. in this picture , they then attributed the 3.780 h period to a `` negative superhump , '' a hump - shaped feature in the light curve with period a few percent less than the orbital period of the binary .",
    "superhumps are believed to be associated with a tilted accretion disk .",
    "this analysis strongly suggests that v842  cen should be classified as an ip .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling why earlier fast optical photometry of v842  cen did not show periodicity @xcite ; presumably , flaring activity observed in that data masked any periodic signatures .",
    "our data can not confirm the short period at x - ray or optical wavelengths .",
    "while the lack of a @xmath2757  s period in the x - ray data does not necessarily rule out a rapidly rotating white dwarf , one generally expects the x - ray data from ips to be modulated at the spin period , since the localized accretion shock near the surface of the white dwarf produces a high temperature thermal spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , our optical data are not sensitive enough to detect a pulse amplitude of 4 mmag as previously measured .",
    "on the other hand , we detect significant periods at 3.51@xmath10.40 h in x - rays and 4.0@xmath10.8 h in optical .",
    "the pulsed fraction @xmath32 of the x - ray light curves folded at this period decreases with energy , ranging from 47@xmath113% in the soft ( 0.3 - 1.0 kev ) , to 45@xmath112% in the medium ( 1.0 - 2.0 kev ) , and to 30@xmath111% in the hard ( 2.0 - 10.0 kev ) x - ray band .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the x - ray spin - phased light curves of ips ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ex  hya ) and can be caused by the energy dependence of the absorption cross - section , occultation of the lower ( cooler ) portion of the accretion column by the white dwarf s body or both .",
    "the modulation detected in our data is somehow different from the orbital period claimed by @xcite at the 3@xmath12 level .",
    "furthermore , the smooth shape of the phase - folded light curves indicates that an orbital origin of the modulation is unlikely . a low orbital inclination as suggested by @xcite also supports this conclusion .",
    "eclipses of the accretion column are observed as sharp decreases in the light curves of ips with high orbital inclination @xcite , lasting for tenths or less of the orbital period .",
    "no conspicuous eclipse feature could be found using a 50 s binning in any of the light curves .    on the other hand ,",
    "the period we have detected is consistent with the value reported by @xcite as a negative superhump ; however , it is not clear how the tilted accretion disk would contribute to such high energy x - ray emission . to our knowledge",
    ", negative superhumps have not been detected in a cv at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , the energy dependence of the pulsed fraction of an x - ray superhump would require explanation .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is fully consistent with thermal emission originating in the post - shock region of a magnetic accretion column ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the model fit to the x - ray spectrum suggests that the white dwarf in v842  cen has a mass @xmath55=0.88 @xmath57 , which is not unusual for an ip .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that among the ips detected with @xmath58/bat , 5 out of 17 have white dwarfs more massive than 0.88 @xmath57 .",
    "given the good agreement with the accretion shock model and a reasonable mass determination , it is difficult to reconcile the lack of detection of the fast period associated with the white dwarf spin . either the fast period is undetectable due to a low inclination or the period we detect is instead the white dwarf spin period",
    ". the latest possibility would be , if confirmed , very rare since the detected period is longer than any known spin periods from ips , .",
    "the shape of the nova remnant in v842  cen also remains puzzling .",
    "the remnant geometry depends on the matter distribution and the ejecta illumination by the central source .",
    "if no accretion disk is present in v842  cen ( e.g. it is a polar cv instead of an ip ) , then the ejecta might be more homogeneously illuminated ; however , at the moment we do not think that this is a possibility as no evidence has been reported elsewhere on the detection of optical polarization or strong soft x - ray emission that would support the polar nature .",
    "one expects the presence of a large accretion disk to affect the photoionization in different regions of the nebula .",
    "the accretion disk may absorb the ionizing photons in the equatorial regions causing an aspherical illumination . in hr  del for example",
    ", the observed aspherical illumination is attributed to high mass transfer and a large disk @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a high white dwarf rotational velocity can generate asymmetries in the eruption conditions because of the effective gravity variation from equatorial to polar regions @xcite .",
    "if we consider a 0.88 m@xmath56 white dwarf with a rotational period of 57 s , we should obtain ejecta with axial ratio of @xmath271.35 ( using expressions 8 to 11 by * ? ? ?",
    "if the rotational period is 3.51 h , the envelope would be symmetric . a period p@xmath59125 s is required to detect an asymmetric envelope .",
    "if the white dwarf is more massive than what we have derived , the asymmetry would be smaller , but detectable ( as a prolate remnant ) .    in summary , the x - ray spectrum and the energy dependence of its pulse fraction support the classification of v842  cen as an ip , but the symmetric shape of the ejecta and the long period of the light curves",
    "are not easily explained in this picture . while the x - ray data do not definitively rule out a very fast 57  s spin period",
    ", a longer period would be less discrepant with the ejecta symmetry .",
    "another possibility is that the ejecta asymmetry axis is the same as that of the line of sight . a clear , definitive determination of the nature of v842  cen ,",
    "in particular whether or not it is an ip and what its spin period is , will contribute to understanding the system and its ejecta morphology .",
