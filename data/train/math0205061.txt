    "thus , deformation of the @xmath5-space may destroy the property of ego of being a curve ( [ g1.4 ] ) .",
    "application of objects , defined by the property ( [ g1.4 ] ) for investigation of t - geometries is inconvenient , because the t - geometry investigation is founded on deform - invariant methods .",
    "formally , one can not choose appropriate envelope function for description of the set ( [ g1.4 ] ) , because the envelope function is deform - invariant , whereas the set ( [ g1.4 ] ) is not .",

    "in other words , the point set ( [ g1.4 ] ) is not deform - invariant .",
    "there are at least two approach to geometry :    \\(1 ) the geometry is supposed to be completely described by the world function . the standard ( proper euclidean ) geometry is such a kind of geometry .",
    "then any possible geometry is one of t - geometries .",
    "\\(2 ) the geometry is supposed to be described by the world function incompletely .",
    "there are functions of three and more number of points , which describe such a geometry ( for instance , functions @xmath68 , ... ) .",
    "we shall refer to such a geometry as the fortified geometry ( fg ) . the standard ( proper euclidean ) geometry is described by the world function @xmath5 . in the euclidean geometry",
    "the function @xmath69 and other functions have some trivial form ( for instance , @xmath70 ) .",
    "the t - geometry pretends only to description of usual geometry , but not to fortified geometry ( fg ) .",
    "it is not quite clear , whether the papers @xcite pretend to description of the fortified geometry , or they are restricted by the usual one . if they pretend only to a description of usual geometry , then the concept of the curve ( [ g1.4 ] ) is only a method for description of geometry ( something like a coordinate system ) , but not an object of geometry .",
    "all real properties of geometry ( not those of the description method ) should be formulated in the form invariant with respect to a change of the description method ( in particular , in the form , where the concept of the curve is not mentioned at all ) .",
    "if the papers @xcite pretend to a description of some special cases of fg , which can not be described by t - geometry , then a use of the concept ( [ g1.4 ] ) may be justified .",
    "but such an approach seems to be too complicated .",
    "it seems to be simpler one to have investigated the usual geometry completely , and thereafter to begin investigation of a more complicated case of fortified geometry .",
    "the next step in the investigation of the usual geometry is a refuse from the constraint ( [ g1.1 ] ) .",
    "such a geometry will be referred to as a nonsymmetric t - geometry .",
    "the nonsymmetric t - geometry can be investigated by the same methods , as the symmetric one .",
    "the world function @xmath5 in the nonsymmetric t - geometry is presented in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the symmetric part of the world function @xmath5 , whereas @xmath73 denotes its antisymmetric part .",
    "motives for consideration of nonsymmetric t - geometry are as follows . in the symmetric t - geometry",
    "the distance from the point @xmath3 to the point @xmath4 is the same as the distance from the point @xmath4 to the point @xmath3 . in the asymmetric t - geometry",
    "it is not so .",
    "apparently , it is not important for spacelike distances in the space - time , because it can be tested experimentally for spacelike distances . in the case , when interval between points @xmath3 and @xmath4 is timelike , one uses watch to measure this interval .",
    "but the watch can measure the time interval only in one direction , and one can not be sure that the time interval is the same in opposite direction .",
    "if the antisymmetric part @xmath73 of the world function does not vanish , it means that the future and the past are not equivalent geometrically .",
    "we do not insist that this fact takes place , but we admit this .",
    "it is useful to construct a nonsymmetric t - geometry , to apply it to the space - time and to obtain the corollaries of asymmetry which could be tested experimentally .",
    "the symmetrical part of the world function generates the field of the metric tensor @xmath74 . in a like way the antisymmetric",
    "part generates some vector force filed @xmath75 .",
    "maybe , existence of this field can be tested experimentally . for",
    "construction of nonsymmetric t - geometry one does not need to make any additional supposition .",
    "it is sufficient to remove the constraint ( [ g1.1 ] ) and to apply mathematical technique developed for the symmetric t - geometry with necessary modifications .    besides",
    ", there is a hope that nonsymmetric t - geometry will be useful in the elementary particle theory , where the main object is a superstring .",
    "the first order tubes ( main objects of t - geometry ) are associated with world tubes of strings . in the nonsymmetric t - geometry antisymmetric variables",
    "they are absent in the conventional symmetric t - geometry , but antisymmetric variables are characteristic for the superstring theory .    two important general remarks .",
    "nonsymmetric t - geometry , as well as the symmetric one , is considered on an arbitrary set @xmath6 of points @xmath3 .",
    "it is formulated in the scope of the purely metric conception of geometry , which is very simple , because it uses only very simple tools for the geometry description . the t - geometry formulated in terms of the world function @xmath5 and finite subsets @xmath76 of the set @xmath6 .",
    "mathematically it means , that the purely metric cg uses only mappings    @xmath77    whereas the topology - metric cg uses much more complicated mappings ( [ g1.4 ] ) , known as curves @xmath78 .",
    "both mappings ( [ c2.8c ] ) and ( [ g1.4 ] ) are methods of the geometry description ( and construction ) .",
    "but the method ( [ c2.8c ] ) is much simpler .",
    "it can be studied exhaustively , whereas the set of mappings ( [ g1.4 ] ) can not .",
    "the nonsymmetric t - geometry will be mainly interpreted as a symmetric t - geometry determined by the two - point scalar @xmath79 with some additional metric structures , introduced to the symmetric geometry by means of the additional two - point scalar @xmath80 .",

    "there are , in general , several different types of geodesics .",

    "<S> nondegenerate geometry ( t - geometry ) with nonsymmetric world function is considered . in application to the space - time geometry the asymmetry of world function means that the past and the future are not equivalent geometrically . </S>",
    "<S> t - geometry is described in terms of finite point subspaces and world function between pairs of points of these subsets , i.e. in the language which is immanent to geometry and free of external means of description ( coordinates , curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a description appears to be simple and effective even in the case of complicated t - geometry . </S>",
    "<S> antisymmetric component of the world function generates appearance of additional metric fields . </S>",

    "<S> three sorts of the first order tubes ( future , past and neutral ) appear . if the fields connected with the antisymmetric component are strong enough , the timelike first order tube has a finite length in the timelike direction . it was shown earler that the symmetric t - geometry explains non - relativistic quantum effects without a reference to principles of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> one should expect that nonsymmetric space - time t - geometry is also characteristic for microcosm , and it will be useful in the elementary particle theory , because there is a series of unexpected associations . </S>",
