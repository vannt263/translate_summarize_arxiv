    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is widely regarded as capable of directly observing the agent responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation .",
    "this is generally believed to be a light higgs boson with mass @xmath8  gev  @xcite , a mass region for which discovery is covered by multiple channels , most notably by the decay that will be of interest here , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "once a higgs boson candidate has been observed , emphasis will shift to a precise determination of its properties .",
    "the lhc promises complete coverage of higgs decay scenarios  @xcite , including general parameterizations in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , invisible higgs decays  @xcite , and possibly even higgs boson decays to muons  @xcite . with mild theoretical assumptions and an integrated luminosity of 200  fb@xmath6 , the higgs boson total width , @xmath10 , and the gauge and various yukawa couplings",
    "can be determined  @xcite with a precision of @xmath11  @xcite . at an @xmath12 linear collider with a center of mass energy of 350  gev or more ,",
    "these measurements can be improved by up to a factor  10  @xcite , if an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath6 can be achieved .    while these studies have shown that future colliders promise broad and significant capability to measure various properties of the higgs sector , what remains is to determine the actual higgs potential .",
    "this appears in the lagrangian as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the higgs field , @xmath15 is the vacuum expectation value , and @xmath16 is the fermi constant . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "@xmath17 regarding the sm as an effective theory , the higgs boson self - coupling @xmath0 is _ per se _ a free parameter .",
    "@xmath18-matrix unitarity constrains @xmath0 to @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "an anomalous higgs boson self - coupling appears in various beyond the sm scenarios , such as models with a composite higgs boson  @xcite , or in two higgs doublet models , for example the mssm  @xcite . to measure @xmath0 , and thus determine the higgs potential , at a minimum experiments must observe higgs boson pair production .",
    "strictly speaking , both the trilinear higgs boson coupling @xmath20 and the quartic coupling @xmath21 have to measured separately in order to fully determine the higgs potential . while @xmath20 can be measured in higgs pair production , triple higgs production is needed to probe @xmath21 .",
    "since the cross sections for @xmath22 production processes are more than a factor @xmath23 smaller than those for higgs pair production at linear colliders  @xcite , and about an order of magnitude smaller at hadron colliders  @xcite , the quartic higgs boson coupling will likely remain elusive even at the highest collider energies and luminosities considered so far . in the following",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to @xmath20 which is related to @xmath0 by @xmath24 .",
    "several studies of higgs pair production in @xmath12 collisions have been conducted over the past few years  @xcite , and quantitative sensitivity limits for @xmath0 have been derived for several proposed linear colliders with center of mass energies spanning the range from @xmath25  gev to 3  tev .",
    "for example , a study employing neural net techniques found that @xmath0 can be measured with a precision of about @xmath26 at a linear collider with @xmath25  gev and an integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath6 , if @xmath27  gev  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the potential of the lhc to probe the higgs boson self coupling has begun to be explored only recently .",
    "a survey of higgs pair production and background processes at an upgraded lhc , which would gather 20  times the amount of data expected in the first run ( dubbed slhc ) , was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed the prospects for determining @xmath0 at the lhc with design luminosity in higgs pair production via gluon fusion and subsequent decay to same - sign dileptons via weak gauge @xmath28 bosons , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are any combination of electrons and muons , and presented quantitative estimates of sensitivity limits for @xmath0 for @xmath32  gev and various integrated luminosities . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pythia  @xcite based study of several final states resulting from @xmath33 and @xmath34 for lhc and slhc was conducted .    in this paper",
    "we present a more detailed and extended analysis of higgs pair production via gluon fusion at hadron colliders . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we included only the two largest sources of background , @xmath35 and @xmath36 production , in our calculation .",
    "the effect of the remaining background contributions on the sensitivity limits for @xmath0 was estimated by scaling the combined @xmath37 and @xmath38 cross section by a factor  1.1 , as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , which found that the remaining backgrounds are small . here",
    "we present a more complete calculation of the background which includes , in addition to @xmath37 and @xmath38 production , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 production .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the potential size of backgrounds arising from overlapping events and double - parton scattering .",
    "we also extend our previous analysis by considering the three lepton channel @xmath46 ( @xmath3 ) , and the background processes which affect it .",
    "in addition to the lhc and slhc , we calculate signal and background cross sections , and derive sensitivity bounds for @xmath0 , for a very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) , assuming a @xmath47 collider operating at @xmath48  tev with a luminosity of @xmath49 .",

    "there are several mechanisms for pair production of higgs bosons in hadronic collisions .",
    "higgs boson pairs can be produced via gluon fusion , @xmath50  @xcite , weak boson fusion , @xmath51  @xcite , associated production with @xmath52 or @xmath53 bosons , @xmath54 , @xmath55  @xcite , and associated production with @xmath56 pairs , @xmath57  @xcite . at the lhc , inclusive higgs boson pair production is dominated by gluon fusion .",
    "the weak boson fusion process , and associated production with @xmath58 bosons or @xmath56 pairs yield cross sections which are about a factor  10 and  30 smaller than that for @xmath50  @xcite . since higgs pair production at the lhc is rate limited , we concentrate on the gluon fusion process in the following .    for @xmath59  gev ,",
    "the dominant decay mode of the sm higgs boson is @xmath60 , and the qcd @xmath61 background overwhelms the @xmath50 signal  @xcite . for @xmath62  gev , @xmath63 dominates , and the @xmath44 final state has the largest individual branching ratio .",
    "if all @xmath52 bosons decay hadronically , qcd multi - jet production dwarfs the signal .",
    "a similar result is obtained for the @xmath64  jet ( only one @xmath52 boson decays leptonically ) , and @xmath65  jet ( one @xmath66 pair decays leptonically ) final states , where @xmath67  multi - jet and @xmath68  multi - jet production provide very large backgrounds .",
    "this leaves the same - sign dilepton final states , @xmath69 , modes where three @xmath52 bosons decay leptonically and one decays hadronically , and the all - leptonic decay modes .",
    "the latter suffer from a large suppression due to the small @xmath70 branching ratio of @xmath71 ( br(@xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "in the following we therefore only consider the @xmath69 and @xmath74 final states .    in this section",
    "we discuss in detail the calculation of signal and background cross sections for the @xmath69 final state .",
    "the three lepton final state will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath50 in the sm consist of fermion triangle and box diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] )  @xcite .",
    "representative feynman diagrams for the process @xmath50 .",
    ", width=566 ]    non - standard higgs boson self - couplings only affect the triangle diagrams with a higgs boson exchanged in the @xmath75-channel .",
    "we calculate the @xmath76 cross section using exact loop matrix elements  @xcite . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the infinite top quark mass limit , which is commonly used in place of exact matrix elements to speed up the calculation , reproduces the correct total cross section for @xmath77 production to within @xmath78 to @xmath79 for higgs masses between 140  gev and 200  gev , but produces completely incorrect kinematic distributions . the intermediate higgs and @xmath52 bosons",
    "are treated off - shell using finite widths in the double pole approximation in our calculation .",
    "decay correlations for the @xmath80  fermion decays are fully taken into account  @xcite .",
    "signal results are computed consistently to leading order qcd with the top quark mass set to @xmath81  gev and sm @xmath82 and top quark yukawa couplings , and the renormalization and factorization scales are taken to be the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "the contributions of all other quarks to the @xmath50 box and triangular diagrams are strongly suppressed due to their @xmath83 couplings , which are proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "the effects of next - to - leading ( nlo ) order qcd corrections are included in our calculation by multiplying the differential cross section by an overall factor @xmath84 at lhc and @xmath85 at vlhc energies ( @xmath86-factor ) for scale choice @xmath87 , as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite where the qcd corrections for @xmath50 have been computed in the large @xmath88 limit .",
    "although this approximation can not replace a calculation of the full nlo qcd corrections to @xmath50 , it is expected to work well in this particular case : it is well known from single higgs boson production via gluon fusion  @xcite that the two  loop qcd corrections to the one  loop higgs production amplitude are well approximated by multiplying the leading order one  loop cross section for a finite top quark mass by the @xmath86-factor obtained in the large @xmath88 limit .",
    "this feature can be easily understood by recalling that the dominant corrections originate from radiation off the initial state gluons , which is universal .",
    "the lowest order @xmath50 cross section exhibits a rather strong dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "for example , for @xmath89  gev and @xmath90 , and using exact loop matrix elements , one obtains a total cross section of 8.26  fb . for @xmath91 ,",
    "on the other hand , one finds a cross section which is almost a factor  1.5 smaller .",
    "nlo qcd corrections , albeit computed in the large @xmath88 limit , significantly reduce the @xmath92 dependence : varying the scale @xmath92 from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , the cross section including the @xmath86-factor decreases by a factor  1.25 instead of  1.5 without the @xmath86-factor .    for @xmath90 , the @xmath86-factor at vlhc energies is smaller than that obtained for the lhc . at higher energies ,",
    "smaller parton momentum fractions are probed .",
    "this results in an increased sensitivity of the cross section to the choice of factorization scale which partially compensates the variation of the cross section with the renormalization scale .    in all our calculations we use a value for the strong coupling constant of @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "all signal and background cross sections are computed using cteq4l  @xcite parton distribution functions .",
    "the kinematic acceptance cuts for both signal and backgrounds in the @xmath69 channel at the lhc and vlhc are : @xmath94 where @xmath95^{1/2}$ ] is the separation in the pseudorapidity  azimuthal angle plane .",
    "in addition we require the four jets to combine into two pseudo-@xmath52 pairs with invariant masses @xmath96 and assume that this captures @xmath97 of the signal and backgrounds .",
    "we do not impose a missing transverse momentum cut which would remove a considerable fraction of the signal events .",
    "detector resolution effects are not taken into account in our calculation .    as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , at the lhc , the main background from @xmath37 and @xmath38 production can be reduced by about @xmath98 , with little impact on the signal , by imposing a more restrictive jet - jet separation cut of @xmath99 .",
    "in contrast , at vlhc energies , there is little gain in tightening the @xmath100 cut .",
    "subsequently , we therefore require @xmath101 in the @xmath69 channel .    our choice of @xmath102 cuts for jets and leptons in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cuts1 ] )   ( [ eq : cuts2 ] ) is driven by the goal of retaining as much signal as possible while ensuring that the lhc experiments , atlas and cms , can record @xmath103 events when operating at the lhc design luminosity of @xmath104 .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] show the @xmath105 differential cross section at the lhc as a function of the lepton and jet minimum transverse momentum , respectively .     the @xmath106 differential cross section as a function of the minimum lepton transverse momentum , @xmath107 , for @xmath47 collisions at @xmath108  tev .",

    "the differential cross section peaks at low values of @xmath113 and falls very quickly with increasing values of the minimum transverse momentum , in particular in the jet case . in order to maximize the signal cross section ,",
    "the lepton and jet @xmath102 thresholds are thus chosen as low as possible and yet be compatible with the requirements of atlas and cms to successfully record such events .",
    "we shall also use the cuts listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cuts1 ] )   ( [ eq : cuts2 ] ) for a luminosity upgraded lhc operating at @xmath114 , and at the vlhc .",
    "preliminary studies have concluded  @xcite that cuts similar to those listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cuts1 ] )   ( [ eq : cuts2 ] ) should be sufficient , although increased background from event pileup is expected to degrade detector performance , in particular at the slhc .",
    "the sm backgrounds of interest are those that produce two same - sign leptons and four well - separated jets which reconstruct in two pairs to a window around the @xmath52 boson mass .",
    "the largest contribution originates from @xmath115 production , followed by @xmath36 where one top quark decays leptonically , the other hadronically , and neither @xmath116 quark jet is tagged . other backgrounds which contribute",
    "are : @xmath39 production ; @xmath43 production , where none of the @xmath116 quark jets are tagged , and additional jets or leptons are not observed ; @xmath117 , @xmath41 and @xmath118 production with leptonic @xmath53 decay ( including off - shell photon interference ) where one lepton is not observed ; and @xmath42 events where one @xmath116 quark decays semileptonically with good hadronic isolation , and the other is not tagged .",
    "in addition , in a high luminosity environment , one has to worry about backgrounds from overlapping events and double parton scattering .",
    "@xmath116-quarks are assumed to be tagged with an efficiency of @xmath119 throughout .",
    "we do not apply an explicit @xmath86-factor for the backgrounds here ; however , we do later include the potential effect of qcd corrections on the backgrounds when we extract limits on the higgs self - coupling ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] ) .",
    "we simulate these backgrounds at the parton level using exact matrix elements generated with madgraph  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 background has a significant contribution from @xmath120 production . for @xmath37 production",
    "we evaluate the strong coupling constant @xmath121 and the parton distribution functions at a scale @xmath92 given by @xmath122 , where the sum extends over all final state particles ; for @xmath38 production we take @xmath123 , and in the @xmath43 case we use @xmath124 .",
    "top quarks are generated on shell ( narrow width approximation ) , while all @xmath52 bosons are allowed to be off shell .",
    "events with one or more tagged @xmath116 quarks are rejected . in the @xmath43 case",
    "we merge jets if their separation in the pseudorapidity  azimuthal angle plane is @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath44 background has a significant contribution from @xmath126 production .",
    "the @xmath44 cross section at the lhc ( vlhc ) is found to be a factor  5 to  25 ( 25 to  80 ) smaller than that of @xmath37 production , depending on the mass of the higgs boson . in this analysis we therefore ignore the @xmath44 background .",
    "although madgraph is able to generate exact matrix elements for @xmath39 production , the large number of contributing feynman diagrams ( more than 6,000 ) makes a full matrix element based calculation of the @xmath39 background impractical . in order to estimate the @xmath39 cross section",
    "we thus have interfaced the matrix elements for @xmath127  @xcite with pythia , which produces the two additional jets in a leading - log shower approximation .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath121 and the parton distribution functions are evaluated at a scale @xmath92 given by @xmath122 , where the sum extends over all final state particles .      we calculate the @xmath41 cross section using exact matrix elements . since more than 15,000 feynman diagrams contribute to @xmath128 production , we estimate the cross section for this process by interfacing the @xmath129 matrix elements  @xcite with pythia , similar to @xmath39 production .",
    "off - shell photon interference effects are taken into account in both cases .",
    "both processes contribute to the background only if one of the leptons from @xmath53/off - shell photon decay is missed .",
    "we consider a lepton to be missed if it has @xmath130  gev or @xmath131 .",
    "if the lepton is within a cone of @xmath132 from a detected lepton and has @xmath133  gev , then the detected lepton is not considered isolated and the event is rejected .",
    "the strong coupling constant and the parton distribution functions are evaluated in @xmath41 ( @xmath128 ) production at @xmath134 ( @xmath122 ) . in order to avoid the collinear singularity when the missed lepton is collinear with an observed lepton ( which is only relevant if the missed lepton has @xmath135  gev ) , finite lepton masses must be maintained in the calculation of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 processes  @xcite , the latter also including additional considerations to maintain gauge invariance of the calculation , due to finite top quark width which must be included for these events .",
    "@xmath41 events are rejected with a factor 4 , which approximates the fraction of events with one or more tagged @xmath116 quarks .    the size of the @xmath45 background can be estimated from the ratio of the @xmath136 and @xmath137 cross sections , together with the suppression factor which arises from requiring that one lepton is missed , and the @xmath37 rate .",
    "we find that the @xmath45 cross section is about a factor  30 to  60 smaller than the @xmath37 cross section , depending on the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "we thus ignore the @xmath45 background in the following .",
    "we calculate @xmath138 production where one of the @xmath116-quarks decays semileptonically with an isolated lepton using exact @xmath139parton and @xmath140 matrix elements .",
    "the lepton from @xmath116-decay is considered not isolated if the charm quark is within a cone of @xmath141 from the lepton and has @xmath142  gev .",
    "events are rejected with a factor two , which approximates the fraction where the second @xmath116 quark would be tagged . in order to regularize the soft parton @xmath102 distribution",
    "so as to reproduce the @xmath102 distribution of the hard recoil system ( @xmath56 ) from a full resummation calculation  @xcite , while preserving the normalization of the hard @xmath56 cross section , we use the truncated shower approximation ( tsa )  @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that qcd matrix elements at tree level contain the full information on angular distributions and hardness of additional jet emission .",
    "a parton shower approach as used in ref .",
    "@xcite would not immediately give reliable answers unless both color coherence and the choice of scale are implemented correctly , matching the answer given by qcd matrix elements for sufficiently hard partons .",
    "in practice this is achieved by integrating the full tree - level @xmath139parton matrix elements over phase space down to @xmath143  gev , and multiplying the result by a factor @xmath144 $ ] , where @xmath145 is adjusted to achieve @xmath146 . for a scale choice of @xmath147",
    ", we find @xmath148  gev for the lhc and vlhc , respectively .",
