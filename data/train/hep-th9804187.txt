    "the now - conventional technique of numerical calculation of quantum field theory involves evaluating the path integral @xmath2 \\label{complexcont}\\ ] ] on a spacetime lattice using monte carlo integration methods .",
    "monte carlo methods have been successful for an interesting class of problems ; however , these techniques have had less success in evaluating theories with actions that are not manifestly positive definite or which have important effects from the details of fermionic interactions beyond the quenched approximation . in these cases , we have either a basic algorithmic difficulty or an inadequacy of compute power .",
    "we are developing an alternative computational method which works both on the lattice and the continuum and which handles fermions as easily as bosons .",
    "furthermore , our `` source galerkin '' method is less restrictive as to the class of allowed actions .",
    "source galerkin tends to use significantly less compute time than monte carlo methods but can consume significantly larger amounts of memory .",
    "this talk is confined to continuum applications ; examples of lattice calculations have been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "while it is not clear that source galerkin can replace monte carlo techniques , it appears that it will be able to solve some problems which are currently inaccessible .",
    "our approach begins with the differential equations satisfied by the vacuum functional @xmath3 for a quantum field theory with external sources .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in this talk we will mostly confine our attention to @xmath0 interactions . to date , we have also studied non - linear sigma models and four - fermion interactions and have gauge theory calculations in progress .",
    "the vacuum persistence function @xmath3 for a scalar field @xmath4 with interaction @xmath5 coupled to a scalar source @xmath6 satisfies the equation : @xmath7 the source galerkin technique is designed to directly solve functional differential equations of this type . before we proceed to outline a solution technique , it is essential to point out that this equation by itself does not uniquely specify a theory @xcite .",
    "this is dramatically illustrated by considering the special case of the above equation limited to one degree of freedom ( zero dimensions ) .",
    "@xmath8 this is a third order differential equation , and therefore possesses three independent solutions .",
    "it is easy to see that one of the solutions for small @xmath9 asymptotically approaches the perturbation theory solution , while the second asymptotically approaches the loop expansion `` symmetry breaking '' solution for small @xmath9 and the third solution has an essential singularity as @xmath9 becomes small .",
    "the situation becomes much more interesting for finite dimensions where the infinite class of solutions coalesces or becomes irrelevant in a way which builds the phase structure of the field theory .",
    "any numerical study must be cognizant of the particular boundary conditions and hence solution of the class of solutions that is being studied .",
    "care must be taken to stay on the same solution as any iterative technique is applied .",
    "the solutions discussed in this talk will be the usual ones which correspond to the symmetry preserving solutions obtained from evaluating a path integral with real axis definitions for the regions of integration .",
    "these are the solutions that are regular in the coupling , @xmath9 , as it approaches zero .",
    "we , for convenience , write ( [ euc1 ] ) in the form : @xmath10 the source galerkin method is defined by picking an approximation @xmath11 to the solution @xmath12 such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a residual dependent on @xmath15 .",
    "we pick the parameters of our approximation to make this residual as small as possible on the average . to give this statement a meaning , we define an inner product over the domain of @xmath15 : _ i.e. _ @xmath16 .",
    "in addition we assume we have a collection of test functions which are members of a complete set ) @xmath17 the source galerkin minimization of the residual @xmath14 is implemented by setting the parameters of our test function @xmath11 so that projections of test functions against the residual vanish so that @xmath18 as the number of test functions @xmath19 .",
    "the equations defining the quantum field theory are differential equations in the field sources and spacetime . while it is straightforward to deal with the spacetime problem by resorting to a lattice",

    "@xmath24 is defined by @xmath25    in addition to this inner product definition , we need good guesses for approximate form for @xmath26 and numerical tools to calculate , symbolically or numerically , various functions and their integrals , derivatives , and so on . for most of our calculations",
    "we have found it very useful to choose a lesser known class of functions , with very suitable properties for numerical calculation , known as sinc functions .",
    "we take our notation for the sinc functions from stenger @xcite : @xmath27 some of the identities that sinc approximations satisfy are given below : @xmath28 these properties , which are proven and expanded upon greatly in @xcite , make these functions very easy to use for galerkin methods , collocation , integration by parts , and integral equations .    with the definition of a norm and set of expansion functions",
    ", we can postulate an anstz for @xmath29 @xmath30\\ ] ] where each green function , @xmath31 , is represented by a @xmath32-dimensional sinc expansion .",
    "for @xmath33 : @xmath34 it is easy to examine this expansion in the case of a free field where we limit the approximation to the terms quadratic in @xmath35 . while the example is trivial , it shows that , as always , numerical approximations must be handled with care .",

    "@xmath38.,height=192 ]    this straightforward expansion works for interacting theories but with more than @xmath39 , the computational costs and storage costs become overwhelming : @xmath40 requires @xmath41 storage units .",
    "there are many ways that storage costs can be reduced , but in general these approaches are difficult , not particularly elegant , and eventually reaches a limit due to the exponential growth in the number of coefficients of the representation .",
    "we can use our knowledge of the spectral representations of field theory and graphical approaches to introduce a much more beautiful and intuitive approach to producing candidates for @xmath26 .",
    "we introduce regulated lehmann representations .",
    "these build in the appropriate spacetime lorentz structure into our approximations and remove the growth of operational cost with spacetime dimension shown by our previous nave decomposition into complete sets of functions . any exact two - point function can be represented as a sum over free two - point functions .",

    "80 terms is appropriate for most hardware floating - point representations .",
    "thus we have a form for a two - point scalar green function , regulated by the scale @xmath47 with constant computational cost regardless of spacetime dimension .",
    "we can take derivatives explicitly or by construction : @xmath48 where @xmath49    from this representation , we can directly construct a fermion two - point function : @xmath50 these representations mean that free scalar and free fermion results are exact and immediate in any galerkin evaluation of these trivial cases . furthermore , because of this simplicity , we have the basis for a complete numerical approach to conventional perturbation theory .",
    "we itemize some results obtained using a regulated single propagator with parameters set by the source galerkin method . at lowest order ,",
    "our anstz for the generating functional is @xmath51 results for this anstz are given in figure [ fig : lowest ] .",
    "mass gap versus coupling ( dashed line gives exact from hioe and montroll , 1975),height=192 ]    these results are strikingly accurate and can matched up essentially exactly with results of monte carlo calculations in two and higher dimensions .",

    "it therefore appears that , at least for the simple cases studied , we have produced a numerical method which draws on the structural information already known in general through symmetry and spectral representations which when combined with galerkin averaging to set parameters converges with very simple guesses for the vacuum amplitude to known correct answers produced through other methods of solution including monte carlo methods .",
    "more complicated gauge problems are under study .",

    "general numerical techniques for source galerkin are discussed in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "we have discussed a method for numerical calculations for field theories on the continuum ; this method being based on the source galerkin technique introduced in @xcite .",
    "the direct approach , using sinc functions for interpolation , is effective but will ultimately be limited by the finite nature of current computational resources .",
    "the lorentz invariant regulated representation derived from lehmann representation does not suffer from these limitations , and is applicable to both perturbation and mean - field - based anstzen .",
    "this approach has the computational advantages of minimal memory utilization and parallelizable algorithms and also allows direct representation of fermionic green functions .",
    "finally , a number of useful peripheral calculations can made using this appoximate representation : one can calculate diagrams in a regulated perturbation theory , as well as calculating dimensionally regularized loops numerically .",
    "in general , this technique of evaluating field theories takes advantage of the symmetries of the lorentz group ; future work includes the extension of the method to more general internal groups , such as gauge groups or supersymmetry .",
