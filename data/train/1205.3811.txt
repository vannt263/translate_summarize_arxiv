    "we assume that @xmath0 is a function meromorphic in a neighborhood of infinity , and consider domains @xmath1 to which the function @xmath0  can be extended in a meromorphic and single - valued manner .",
    "the basic problem of our investigation is to find the domain with a complement of minimal ( logarithmic ) capacity .",
    "it will be shown that for any function @xmath0 that is meromorphic at infinity such a domain exists and is essentially unique .",
    "the domain is called extremal , and its complement is called the minimal set ( or  the set of minimal capacity ) .",
    "formal definitions are given in the sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] .",
    "extremal domains play an important role in rational approximation , and there especially in the convergence theory of pad approximants ( cf .",

    "several elements of the material in the present article have already been studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the seven values are given in ( [ f65c ] ) , further below , but their location can readily be read from figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "the rather simple construction of the function @xmath0 makes it easy to understand all possible meromorphic and single - valued continuations of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 possesses a single - valued continuation throughout a domain @xmath6 if , and only if , @xmath7 and if each of the two sets @xmath8 and @xmath9 of branch points is connected in the complement @xmath2 .",
    "the union of the @xmath10 arcs in figure [ fig0 ] form the set of minimal capacity for the function @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath11 , and by @xmath12 we denote the extremal domain .",
    "their definition and details about the calculation of the minimal set @xmath11 will be given in section [ s2 ] and in the discussion of example [ e65 ] in section [ s6 ] , further below .",

    "[ fig0 ] , the poles of this approximant are represented by stars . for any @xmath16  the pad approximant @xmath17_{f}=p / q$ ] is defined by the relation @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 polynomials of degree at most @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "an comprehensive introduction to pad approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the connection between pad approximation and the minimal set @xmath11 will be established in the next theorem , which covers functions of type ( [ f1a ] ) .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite ( cf . also @xcite theorem 6.6.9 ) , and is given here in a somewhat shortened and specialized form .",
    "[ t1a ] for @xmath23 , the pad approximants @xmath17_{f}$ ] converge to the function ( [ f1a ] ) in capacity in the extremal domain @xmath24 associated with @xmath0 , and this convergence is optimal in the sense that it does not hold throughout any domain @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "theorem [ t1a ] shows that extremal domains are convergence domains for pad approximants , and this is also the case for our concrete example . in figure [ fig0 ] we observe that @xmath27  out of @xmath14 poles of the pad approximant @xmath13_{f}$ ] are distributed very nicely along the @xmath10 arcs that form the minimal set @xmath28 .",
    "they are asymptotically distributed in accordance to the equilibrium distribution on the minimal set @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 1.8 ) , and they mark the places , where we do nt have convergence .",
    "there are two poles that step out of line , and each one by a different reason : one of them lies close to the origin , where it approximates the simple pole of the function @xmath0 at the origin . because of its correspondence to a pole of @xmath0",
    ", it is called systematic .",
    "the other one , which lies at @xmath29 , does not correspond to a singularity of the function @xmath0 , and does obviously also not belong to any of the chains of poles along the arcs in @xmath11 .",
    "such poles are called spurious in the theory of pad approximation .",
    "spurious poles always appear in combination with a nearby zero of the approximant .",
    "these pairs of poles and zeros are close to cancellation .",
    "they are a phenomenon that unfortunately can not be ignored in pad approximation ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , or @xcite chapter 6 ) .",
    "convergence in capacity is compatible with the possibility of such spurious poles .",
    "the convergence in capacity in theorem [ t1a ] implies that almost all poles of the pad approximants @xmath17_{f}$ ] have to leave the extremal domain @xmath30 ; they cluster on the minimal set @xmath11 . that they do this in a rather regular way is shown in figure [ fig0 ]",
    "the picture does not change much for other values of @xmath22 only that the location , and possibly also the number of spurious poles may be different in each case .",
    "if one wants to summarize the somewhat complicated convergence theory for diagonal pad approximants in a short sentence one can say that extremal domains are for pad approximants what discs are for power series .      in the next two sections [ s2 ] and",
    "[ s3 ] , two alternative formal definitions are given for the extremality problem under investigation . in the second approach ,",
    "the role of the function @xmath0 is taken over by a concrete riemann surface @xmath31 over @xmath32 . both formulations are equivalent .",
    "illustrative examples are discussed in section [ s6 ] , but before that in the two sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] , general results about minimal sets and extremal domains are formulated and discussed .",
    "all proofs are postponed to later sections .    in section [ s7 ] , a local version of the extremality problem is formulated and discussed .",
    "after that in section [ s8 ] , the extremality problem is compared with some classical problems from geometric functions theory . for such problems",
    "there exists a broad range of tools and techniques , as for instance , boundary and inner variational methods , methods of extremal length , and techniques connected with quadratic differentials ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these ideas will play a role in our investigation .",
    "we shall use a solution of one of these problems as building block in one of our proofs .",
    "practically , no proofs are given in the sections [ s2 ] - [ s5 ] and [ s7 ] ; they all are all postponed to the sections [ s9 ] and [ s10 ] . in section [ s110 ] ,",
    "several auxiliary results from potential theory and geometric function theory are assembled , of which some have been modified quite substantially in order to fit their purpose in the present paper .",
    "it is a typical feature of the approach chosen in the present article that a general existence and uniqueness proof is put at the beginning of the analysis .",
    "this strategy has the advantage of giving great methodological liberty in later proofs of special properties . at these later stages ,",
    "the knowledge of unique existence offers a free choice between different methods and techniques from the tool boxes of geometric function theory ; and because of the uniqueness it is always clear that one is dealing with the same well defined object .",
    "the prize to be paid for this strategy is a rather abstract and somewhat heavy machinery for the uniqueness proof .",
    "the main tools there are potential - theoretic in nature",
    ".    it has been mentioned , and hopefully also illustrated by the introductory example ( [ f1a ] ) , that extremality with respect to the logarithmic capacity arises in a very natural way in connection with diagonal pad approximants . in rational approximation also other types of capacity are of interest , as for instance , condenser capacity or capacities in external fields , which become relevant in connection with rational interpolants ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or with essentially non - diagonal pad approximants .",
    "the specific form of tools and methods in the present analysis should be helpful for such potential generalizations .",
