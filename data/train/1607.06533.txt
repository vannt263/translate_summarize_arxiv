    "the source went into a flaring phase .",
    "the prominent optical flare discovered in 2014 april @xcite coincides with the peak of radio emission , but since the source has reached similar brightness at two other occasions during the 8-yr monitoring period , this might be just coincidental .",

    "[ variability ] , the source has a flat radio spectrum and shows strong variability in the radio .",

    "following @xcite , we calculated the radio - loudness parameter @xmath27 , defined as the ratio of the radio flux density at 5  ghz to the nuclear optical flux density at 4400   @xcite . for a source at @xmath5 ,",

    "optical flaring of blazars have been studied for over five decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "long - term multi - band monitoring of a sample of blazars shows a tight correlation between the radio and optical luminosities @xcite . at the moment , it is not clear yet whether a similar correlation exists for j0809 + 5341 , but we note that the major optical flare in 2014 took place at the same time when the 15 ghz radio flux density reached its the peak in april ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "our vlbi observations were performed several months later , when the total radio flux density had already dropped considerably .",
    "the vlbi flux densities at various frequencies and epochs reported in this paper show a good consistency with the total flux density of the 15 ghz ovro light curve ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) , indicating that the total flux density is dominated by the compact vlbi core , and the core has a flat radio spectrum during this relatively quiet stage .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the first detection of j0809 + 5341 in the x - ray and @xmath2-ray bands .",
    "this increase in high - energy emission is coincidental and likely associated with the giant optical flare . as mentioned earlier , the seed photon sources for inverse compton scattering may originate in the blr , the molecular torus , or the radio core .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath2-ray properties are consistent with an emission region outside of the blr . in this case",
    "the flaring radio emission is expected to be completely synchrotron self - absorbed , and the observed maximum in radio flux density is likely a chance coincidence .",
    "when the shocked ejecta travel along the jet , we expect to see an increase of radio emission as it becomes transparent , first at the highest frequencies , as predicted by the shock - in - jet model @xcite . the fact that there has been no increase at 43  ghz in our monitoring implies that the flaring radio emission was either very short - lived , or the shocked ejecta has not propagated yet to the optically thin region .",
    "alternatively , the optical flare and the radio outburst , as well as the increase in the high - energy flux are physically related .",
    "most blazar outbursts are known to occur at pc - scale distances from the central engine , around the radio core region ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this can be confirmed by long - term monitoring observations with dense time sampling , from radio to @xmath2-rays , supplemented with high - resolution vlbi monitoring in the radio .",
    "such programmes are being undertaken for some of the most prominent blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) but not for j0809 + 5341",
    ". however , it is also possible that no new jet component was associated with the flare of j0809 + 5341 , as , e.g. , found for the blazar mrk 421 by @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that the jet rapidly loses its kinetic energy and does not reach the region that can be imaged with the resolution offered by vlbi .",
    "based on the vlbi - measured flux density and source size presented in sect .",
    "[ size ] , we calculated the apparent brightness temperature of j0809 + 5341 using the following equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the brightness temperature in kelvin , @xmath32 [ jy ] is the flux density of the `` core '' at the observing frequency @xmath23 [ ghz ] , @xmath33 [ mas ] is the fwhm size of the best - fit circular gaussian model .",
    "the redshift is @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the calculated brightness temperatures for the different vlbi experiments are listed in table  [ tab : mf ] .",
    "the brightness temperatures are in the range of @xmath35k .",
    "these values are typical for most other radio - loud quasars observed with vlbi at around @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 values at 43  ghz appear consistently smaller than those measured at lower frequencies ( table  [ tab : mf ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon has also been found in previous high - frequency vlbi surveys @xcite .",
    "the difference derived from the statistical investigation of large samples is not simply due to source variability or other observing effects .",
    "a possible reason might be related to non - zero gradients in the physical conditions in the jet flow , and high - frequency ( 43- and 86-ghz ) vlbi observations probe the optically thin region where @xmath31 is intrinsically lower @xcite . on the other hand , as we pointed out in sect .",
    "3.1 , the core is not completely resolved , and in our case the fitted component size represents an upper limit at the highest frequencies .",
    "this means that the calculated @xmath31 values at 43  ghz are in fact lower limits .",
    "therefore we can not independently confirm the decrease of @xmath31 with frequency for j0809 + 5341 .",
    "the brightness temperature of blazars is amplified by the doppler boosting effect as the approaching jets are oriented close to the line of sight .",
    "usually , the equipartition brightness temperature @xmath37k @xcite is considered to be a reasonable estimate of the intrinsic value @xmath38 .",
    "the doppler boosting factor is thus derived from the observed brightness temperature as @xmath39 . the estimated doppler factors ( lower limits in cases where the @xmath31 values are lower limits as well ) for j0809 + 5341 listed in table  [ tab : mf ] range from at least 0.4 to 10.6 .",
    "the observations of @xmath40 at some epochs might indicate a non - stationary flow of plasma resulting in both deviations from equipartition as well as projection effects of a curved plasma flow trajectory .",
    "however we note that the @xmath41 values somewhat below unity in table 2 are all estimated at 43 ghz and , as discussed above , are lower limits because the source is unresolved at this frequency .",
    "therefore the lower values are not inconsistent with the presence of doppler boosting in the jet .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source during the flare was fitted by @xcite with a synchrotron self - compton model , confirming that j0809 + 5341 is a powerful blazar .",
    "@xcite note however that the high - energy properties of j0809 + 5341 are reminiscent of low - redshift blazars rather than high - redshift ones .",
    "its optical spectrum is dominated by synchrotron emission from the jet rather than an extremely luminous accretion disk ; its @xmath2-ray spectrum is flat rather than steep ; and , it hosts a relatively low - mass black hole ( @xmath42 ) ( cf . * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our vlbi result reveals a relativistic jet with a moderate doppler boosting factor , consistent with typical blazar radio properties in general . from the sed ,",
    "@xcite estimate a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath43 in the jet , and suggest that the jet becomes radiatively efficient during the flare .",
    "assuming the jet parameters obtained from sed fitting by @xcite , we independently estimate the doppler factor @xmath41 , following , e.g. , @xcite : @xmath44^{-1},\\ ] ] where the bulk velocity measured in the units of the speed of light @xmath45 is @xmath46 substituting @xmath43 and the jet viewing angle @xmath47 @xcite , we get @xmath48 .",
    "it is higher compared to the values we derived from vlbi data ( table  [ tab : mf ] ) .",
    "a possible reason is that we overestimate the intrinsic brightness temperature @xmath38 by a factor of @xmath32 by adopting the equipartition value @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "* ) , and thus underestimate the doppler factor by the same factor .    in the relativistic beaming model applied to the parameters of j0809 + 5341 , the observed transverse speed of a radio - emitting blob in the jet , expressed in the units of @xmath45 is @xmath49 assuming the jet model for j0809 + 5341 proposed by @xcite , using @xmath48 for the dopler factor , we can estimate the expected apparent proper motion @xmath50 of a putative newly - ejected superluminal jet component possibly associated with the optical flare ( and the coincident radio and high - energy emission peak ) in 2014 april , following @xcite : @xmath51 here @xmath52  mpc @xcite , and thus @xmath53  mas  yr@xmath8 .",
    "this slow apparent proper motion is consistent with our results , in particular with the fact that we did not detect any sign of a new jet component in our follow - up vlbi observations within 1.1  yr after the flare , with angular resolutions @xmath54  mas ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "if there was an emerging blob in the jet , then it was still blended with the `` core '' .",
    "another possibility is that the flare did not generate a jet component .",
    "follow - up vlbi imaging over a sufficiently long time interval may eventually reveal a jet ejection , unless the blob is expanding and fading too rapidly to be detected several years after the flare .",

    "brightness temperature and doppler boosting factor estimated for j0809 + 5341 from the vlbi data are consistent with the presence of a relativistically beamed blazar jet .",

    "<S> a bright optical flare was detected in the high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) quasar cgrabs j0809 + 5341 on 2014 april 13 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute magnitude of the object reached @xmath1 during the flare , making it the brightest one ( in flaring stage ) among all known quasars so far . </S>",
    "<S> the 15 ghz flux density of cgrabs j0809 + 5341 monitored in the period from 2008 to 2016 also reached its peak at the same time . to reveal any structural change possibly associated with the flare in the innermost radio structure of the quasar </S>",
    "<S> , we conducted a pilot very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observation of cgrabs j0809 + 5341 using the european vlbi network ( evn ) at 5 ghz on 2014 november 18 , about seven months after the prominent optical flare . </S>",
    "<S> three epochs of follow - up kava ( korean vlbi network and vlbi exploration of radio astrometry array ) observations were carried out at 22 and 43 ghz frequencies from 2015 february 25 to june 4 , with the intention of exploring a possibly emerging new radio jet component associated with the optical flare . however , these high - resolution vlbi observations revealed only the milliarcsecond - scale compact `` core '' that was known in the quasar from earlier vlbi images , and showed no sign of any extended jet structure . neither the size , nor the flux density of the `` core '' changed considerably after the flare according to our vlbi monitoring . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that any putative radio ejecta associated with the major optical and radio flare could not yet be separated from the `` core '' component , or the newly - born jet was short - lived . </S>"
