    "<S> @xmath0 correlators have been calculated on the milc collaboration s archive of three flavor improved staggered quark lattices . the @xmath0 is stable under strong interactions ( 140 mev below threshold ) . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a valuable consistency check on a combination of strange quark mass and lattice scale determination from other quantities . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the @xmath0 mass could be used to fix the strange quark mass , which gives a check on computations of the strange quark mass based on the kaon mass .    </S>",
    "<S> although the most timely results of lattice qcd are otherwise unknown hadronic matrix elements needed for determination of ckm matrix elements , precise computations of experimentally well known quantities are essential tests of our methods . </S>",
    "<S> a small number of such quantities have been computed using three flavors of improved staggered sea quarks , showing agreement with experiment at the few percent level@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the @xmath0 baryon is another such quantity , since the particle is well below the threshold for strong decays and its mass is precisely known . from the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation to the physical light quark mass is much better controlled for this particle than for baryons containing light valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the one complication is that the @xmath0 mass is very sensitive to the mass of the strange quark  indeed , we could use it as a way of fixing the strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> recently the hpqcd , milc , and ukqcd collaborations have determined the physical strange quark mass in these lattice simulations from a study of pseudoscalar meson properties , which , roughly speaking , amounts to fixing the strange quark mass by tuning the kaon mass@xcite . with the strange quark mass fixed , the computation of the @xmath0 mass becomes another test of our lattice methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the nlo chiral corrections to the decuplet baryon masses come from loop diagrams where the baryon splits into a pseudoscalar meson and either a decuplet or octet baryon . </S>",
    "<S> isospin and strangeness conservation and the absence of an octet baryon with @xmath1 insure that the diagrams containing a pion do not contribute to the @xmath0 mass . </S>",
    "<S> diagrams with a kaon are present , but the kaon mass does not vanish as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> higher order corrections will of course be present , but a linear ( or polynomial ) extrapolation in light quark mass is much better for the @xmath0 than for other baryons .    to isolate the decuplet baryons , </S>",
    "<S> a nonlocal operator is needed with kogut - susskind quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we use an operator from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , following the implementation of ref.@xcite , with code written by c.  detar@xcite . while the @xmath0 correlator is statistically significant to larger distances than the @xmath3 correlator because of its heavier valence quarks , the decuplet baryons larger masses make them relatively noisier and more difficult to fit than the octet baryons .     </S>",
