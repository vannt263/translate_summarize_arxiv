    "experiments are presently under way which attempt to identify the nature of dark matter @xcite by direct detection on earth .",
    "the dark matter candidates which are being searched for in this manner are wimps and axions .",
    "wimps is an acronym for `` weakly interactive massive particles '' .",
    "the best motivated candidate of this type is the lightest supersymmetric partner in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics @xcite .",
    "the mass range for which wimps provide the critical energy density for closing the universe is a few gev to a few hundred gev .",
    "the axion is a light pseudo - scalar particle whose existence has been postulated to explain why , in the context of the standard model of particle physics , the strong interactions conserve p and cp @xcite .",
    "the likely mass range for which axions provide the critical energy density for closing the universe is @xmath1 ev @xmath2 ev @xcite .",
    "axions and wimps are the leading cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates .",
    "other forms of dark matter are neutrinos and dark baryons . from the point of view of galaxy formation ,",
    "the defining properties of cdm are :    1 .   that cdm particles , unlike baryons , are guaranteed to interact with their surroundings only through gravity , and 2 .   that cdm particles , unlike neutrinos , have negligibly small primordial velocity dispersion .",
    "studies of large scale structure formation support the view that the dominant fraction of dark matter is cdm . moreover ,",
    "if some fraction of the dark matter is cdm , it necessarily contributes to galactic halos by falling into the gravitational wells of galaxies and hence is susceptible to direct detection on earth .",
    "wimps are being searched for by looking for wimp + nucleus elastic scattering in a laboratory detector @xcite .",
    "the nuclear recoil can be put into evidence by low temperature calorimetry , by ionization detection or by the detection of ballistic phonons .",
    "axions are being searched for by stimulating their conversion to photons in a laboratory magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the experimental apparatus involves an electromagnetic cavity placed in the bore of a superconducting solenoid .",
    "when the resonant frequency of the lowest tm mode of the cavity equals the axion mass ( @xmath3 ) , some galactic halo axions convert to microwave photons inside the cavity .",
    "if a signal is found in the cavity detector of dark matter axions , it will be possible to measure the energy spectrum of the axions with great precision and resolution .",
    "( the energy resolution is limited only by the measurement integration time and the stability of the local oscillator with which the axion signal is compared . )",
    "hence the question arises : what can be learned about our galaxy and the universe by analyzing such a signal ?",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to address this question by predicting properties of the cdm spectrum on earth in terms of cosmological input parameters .",
    "incidentally , all cdm candidates have the same phase space distribution , and hence the same spectrum on earth , in the limit where their small primordial velocity dispersions are neglected . we are motivated in part by the fact that knowledge of the spectrum may help in the discovery of a signal .    in many past discussions of dark matter detection on earth",
    ", it has been assumed that the dark matter particles have an isothermal distribution , or an adiabatic deformation of an isothermal distribution .",
    "a strong argument in favor of this assumption is the fact that it predicts the rotation curve of the galaxy to be flat at large radial distances .",
    "indeed , self - gravitating isothermal spheres always have density distributions @xmath4 which fall off at large @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , they have a `` core radius '' , i.e. a radius @xmath7 within which the density @xmath4 no longer behaves as @xmath6 but goes to a constant as @xmath8 .",
    "the behaviour may , for most practical purposes , be approximated by the function @xmath9^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , the contribution of an isothermal halo to the galactic rotation velocity goes to zero as @xmath8 .",
    "this feature of isothermal halos is attractive as well because it is known that , in spiral galaxies like our own , the rotation velocity at small radii may be entirely accounted for by the bulge and the disk . in our galaxy , the core radius is such that roughly half of the rotation velocity squared at the solar radius @xmath10 kpc is due to the disk and bulge while the other half is due to the dark halo .",
    "thermalization of the galactic halo has been argued to be the outcome of a period of `` violent relaxation '' @xcite following the collapse of the protogalaxy . if it is strictly true that the velocity distribution of the dark matter particles is isothermal , then the only information that can be gained from its observation is the corresponding virial velocity and our own velocity relative to its standard of rest .",
    "however , one may convince oneself that the velocity distribution of dark matter particles has a non - thermal component .",
    "consider the fact that our closest neighbor on the galactic scale , the galaxy m31 in andromeda , at a distance of order 730 kpc from us , is falling towards our galaxy with a line - of - sight velocity of 120 km / sec .",
    "this motion can be understood to be due to the mutual gravitational attraction between the two galaxies : first they were receding from each other as part of the general hubble flow , this relative motion was halted and now they are falling towards one another .",
    "we may use m31 as an indicator of the motion of any matter in our neighborhood .",
    "moreover , if cold dark matter exists , then there is cold dark matter at every physical point in space ( including everywhere we see nothing and which appears empty ) , because by liouville s theorem the 3-dim . sheet in 6-dim .",
    "phase - space on which the cdm particles lie can not be ruptured .",
    "the thickness of that sheet is the tiny primordial velocity dispersion of the cdm particles , of order @xmath11 for wimps and @xmath12 for axions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the implication of the above is that , if cdm exists , there are cdm particles falling onto our galaxy continuously and from all directions .",
    "the motion of these particles gets randomized by gravitational scattering off giant molecular clouds , globular clusters and other inhomogeneities but complete thermalization of their velocity distribution occurs only after they have fallen in and out of the galaxy many times . as a result",
    "there are peaks in the velocity distribution of cdm particles at any physical point in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "one peak is due to particles falling onto the galaxy for the first time , one peak is due to particles falling out of the galaxy for the first time , one peak is due to particles falling in for the second time , and so on . in particular , this is true on earth .",
    "the width of the first two peaks , which we label n=1 , is related to and is of order the velocity dispersion of the particles before they fall in for the first time .",
    "the width of the next two peaks ( n=2 ) is expected to be somewhat larger as a result of scattering of the particles off inhomogeneities in the galaxy .",
    "the width of the next two peaks ( n=3 ) is larger still because these particles have been scattered more .",
    "and so on .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to obtain estimates of the sizes and velocity magnitudes of the velocity peaks on earth . by `` size '' , we mean the contribution of the peak to the local mass density of the halo . by `` velocity magnitude '' , we mean the magnitude of the velocity vector of the particles in the peak as measured in the rest frame of the galaxy , i.e. in a frame which is not corotating with the disk .",
    "the tool we use is the secondary infall model @xcite of galactic halo formation .",
    "this model assumes a single overdensity in an expanding universe . a halo forms around the overdensity because dark matter keeps falling onto it .",
    "the dark matter is assumed to have gravitational interactions only and to have zero initial velocity dispersion .",
    "the model also assumes spherical symmetry .",
    "finally , in its original form , it assumes that the dark matter particles have zero angular momentum with respect to the center and hence that their motion is purely radial .",
    "much progress @xcite in the analysis of the model was made as a result of the realization that the time - evolution is self - similar provided @xmath14 and provided the initial overdensity has a special scale - free form ; see eq.([inm ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 that appears in this ansatz is related to the slope of the power spectrum of primordial density perturbations at the galactic scale .",
    "self - similarity means that the halo is time - independent after all distances are rescaled by an overall time - dependent size @xmath15 and all masses by a time - dependent mass @xmath16 .",
    "the self - similar solutions can be obtained numerically with great precision and some of their properties may be derived analytically .",
    "when the parameter @xmath0 is in the range @xmath17 , the density profile @xmath18 and thus the rotation curve is flat .",
    "however , for the purpose of estimating the sizes of velocity peaks , the secondary infall model without angular momentum is rather inadequate . in particular",
    ", it tends to overestimate the size of the peaks due to dark matter particles falling in and out of the galaxy for the first time .",
    "indeed , angular momentum has the effect of keeping infalling dark matter away from the galactic center and this effect is largest for particles falling into the galaxy last . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of angular momentum destroys spherical symmetry and thus makes the actual evolution far more complicated and untractable .",
    "however , as will be explained in detail below , it is possible to include _ the effect _ of angular momentum into the secondary infall model without destroying its spherical symmetry by averaging over all possible orientations of an actual physical halo @xcite .",
    "moreover , the time evolution of the model with angular momentum thus included is still self - similar provided the angular momentum distribution is of a particular scale - free form .",
    "it was also found @xcite that angular momentum has the effect of making the halo contribution to the galactic rotation curve go to zero at the galactic center , thus introducing an effective core radius for the halo mass distribution .",
    "we define the effective core radius @xmath19 to be the radius at which the halo contributes half of the galaxy s rotation velocity squared . for our galaxy",
    ", @xmath19 is of order our own distance to the galactic center .",
    "this by itself suggests that the effect of angular momentum on the velocity peaks on earth is not small .",
    "the model with angular momentum can be accurately solved on a computer .",
    "its predictions for the effective core radius @xmath19 , the local halo density , and the expected sizes and velocity magnitudes of the first few velocity peaks are tabulated below for representative values of the input parameters , which are the age of the universe , the parameter @xmath0 and the average amount of angular momentum .",
    "we also give an analytical treatment of the model under simplifying but realistic assumptions .",
    "it yields general formulae which may be used to estimate the expected sizes and the velocity magnitudes of the velocity peaks for a wide range of the input parameter values .    in section",
    "ii we review the arguments of ref @xcite why velocity peaks in the cold dark matter spectrum on earth are expected , and add some comments of our own . in section iii we give a detailed description of the self - similar infall model , without and with angular momentum . in section",
    "iv we describe how some of the model parameters are determined in terms of observed properties of our galaxy and we give the results of the numerical integration of the model .",
    "section v contains our analytical treatment of the model .",
    "section vi summarizes our results .",
    "in cold dark matter scenarios , the initial phase space distribution is a very thin sheet near @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the hubble rate and @xmath22 is the position relative to an arbitrarily chosen reference point .",
    "the deviations from perfect hubble flow which are present are associated with the primordial density perturbations that will produce galaxies and large scale structures by gravitational instability .",
    "where a galaxy ( or some other object ) forms and grows , the phase space sheet is folding itself up .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phsi1 ] for the simplified case where a single spherically symmetric overdensity is present in an otherwise homogeneous universe and where all dark matter particles move on radial orbits through the center of the overdensity .",
    "the line in the figure indicates the location of the dark matter particles in @xmath23 phase space at an instant of time .",
    "@xmath5 is the distance to center of the overdensity and @xmath24 .",
    "as time goes on the line `` winds up '' in the clockwise direction , rotating most rapidly at the center .",
    "[ fig : phsi1 ] shows that the velocity spectrum of cold dark matter particles on earth , or anywhere else in the galaxy , has a series of peaks .",
    "one peak is due to particles falling onto the galaxy for the first time , passing by earth while going towards the galactic center .",
    "a second peak is due to particles which are falling out of the galaxy for the first time , passing by earth while going away from the galactic center .",
    "a third peak is due to particles falling onto the galaxy for the second time .",
    "a fourth peak is due to particles falling out of the galaxy for the second time . and so on .",
    "a rough estimate of the number @xmath25 of velocity peaks on earth in this idealized case may be obtained as the ratio of the age of the galaxy @xmath26 years ) to the time @xmath27 years ) it takes a particle to fall to the center of the galaxy starting from rest at the earth s location , with the result @xmath28 .",
    "however , the presence of angular momentum of the dark matter particles tends to decrease @xmath25 by restricting the range of radii over which dark matter orbits vary .",
    "( in the extreme limit of circular orbits , @xmath29 . ) as will be seen below , this expectation @xcite is confirmed by our calculations .",
    "we shall also find that the number of peaks depends upon @xmath0 .",
    "of course the description of a galactic halo presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phsi1 ] is much simplified . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we discuss the sensitivity of the conclusion , that there are peaks in the cold dark matter velocity distribution on earth , to the simplifying assumptions that were made .",
    "in particular , we inquire into the effect of    1 .   the gravitational scattering of the dark matter particles by inhomogeneities in the galaxy 2 .   the angular momentum that the dark matter particles have with respect to the galactic center 3 .",
    "the velocity dispersion that the dark matter particles have before they fall onto the galaxy .",
    "the effect of the gravitational scattering of the dark matter particles by the inhomogeneities in the galaxy , such as stars , globular clusters and large molecular clouds , is to `` fuzz up '' the phase space sheets .",
    "consider a phase space sheet which in the absence of scattering produces on earth a stream with unique velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the collective effect of scattering by a class of objects of mass @xmath31 and density @xmath32 is to diffuse the velocities in the stream over a cone of opening angle @xmath33 given by @xcite @xmath34 where the time integral is over the past history of the particles in the stream , @xmath19 is the impact parameter of a scattering and @xmath35 is the velocity of the sheet relative to the scattering center . in the galactic disk ,",
    "the giant molecular clouds are most likely the main contributors . with @xmath36 kpc and @xmath37 pc",
    ", they yield @xmath38 for dark matter particles that have spent most of their past in the galactic disk . the contributions due to globular clusters ( @xmath39 ) and stars ( @xmath40 ) are less important .",
    "at any rate , peaks due to dark matter particles that have spent much of their past in the central parts of the galaxy are likely to be washed out . on the other hand ,",
    "the peaks due to dark matter particles which have fallen in and out of the galaxy only a small number of times in the past are not erased by scattering .",
    "the presence of the rotating galactic disk clearly indicates that the baryons in our galaxy carry angular momentum .",
    "this angular momentum is thought to have been produced by the gravitational forces of nearby galaxies when ours started to form .",
    "one should expect the dark matter in the galactic halo to have similar amounts of angular momentum and hence to move on non - radial orbits .",
    "if an infalling particle s angular momentum is large enough , its distance of closest approach to the galactic center is larger than our own distance ( @xmath41 8.5 kpc ) to the galactic center and hence it can not possibly reach us .",
    "it is nonetheless true that particles falling onto the galaxy for the first time reach us at all times , even if the typical distance of closest approach of such particles to the galactic center is much larger than 8.5 kpc .",
    "indeed , consider all particles that reach their turnaround radius at a given time .",
    "`` turnaround '' refers to the moment in a particle s history when it reaches zero radial velocity with respect to the galactic center for the first time , after its initial hubble flow velocity has been halted by the gravitational pull of the galaxy and before it starts to fall onto the galaxy for the first time ; see fig . [",
    "fig : phsi1 ] .",
    "all particles that reach their turnaround radius at a given time are on a surface which , from a topological viewpoint , is a sphere enclosing the galactic center . let us call this surface the `` turnaround sphere '' . by consulting a catalog of the galaxies in our neighborhood and plotting their radial velocities as a function of distance ,",
    "one concludes that the radius of the present turnaround sphere is of order 1 - 2 mpc for our galaxy .",
    "consider the turnaround sphere at an arbitrary time t. at any point on that surface the angular momentum vector has a unique value parallel to the surface .",
    "now , it is well known that a continuous vector field on a 2-sphere can not everywhere differ from zero .",
    "it must have at least two zeros .",
    "hence there are two places on any turnaround sphere where the angular momentum vanishes .",
    "the particles from these two locations will pass through the galactic center when they fall onto the galaxy next , producing two velocity peaks there . by continuity",
    "( the phase space sheet can not tear ) , other particles on the turn - around sphere will produce two velocity peaks at any point sufficiently close to the center .",
    "[ fig : ts ] shows the time evolution of a turn - around sphere which is initially rigidly rotating about an axis and which subsequently is moving under the influence of the gravitational potential of an isothermal sphere .",
    "the figure demonstrates that any turnaround sphere passes ( at least ) twice by any point inside of it , once on the way in and once on the way out , assuming only that the point is inside the sphere both at its first and its second turnaround . by definition ,",
    "second turnaround is when the sphere reaches its maximum size for the second time in its history , just after its first oscillation .",
    "thus we find that when angular momentum is included , there are still two ( possibly more but necessarily an even number ) velocity peaks on earth due to particles falling through the galaxy for the first time , two peaks or more due to particles falling through the galaxy for the second time , and so on . as we saw in the preceding subsection , these peaks are not erased by scattering off stars , globular clusters or giant molecular clouds .",
    "the sizes and velocity magnitudes of these peaks constitute the main topic of this paper .    finally , let us note the effect angular momentum has on the caustics of a halo .",
    "a `` caustic '' is a place where the dark matter density is large because the phase space sheet folds back there .",
    "the density actually diverges at the caustic in the limit where the thickness of the phase space sheet goes to zero .",
    "there is an outer caustic surface near the @xmath32-th turnaround radius with @xmath42 ; see fig . [",
    "fig : phsi1 ] . it can be shown that near a caustic surface , the dark matter density behaves as @xmath43 + constant , where @xmath44 is the distance to the caustic surface and @xmath45 is the heaviside function : @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "now , when angular momentum is absent , the center of the galaxy is a very special point because all dark matter particles go through the center at each orbital oscillation .",
    "the dark matter density goes as @xmath49 at the center if there is no angular momentum and the rotation curve is flat .",
    "thus , in the absence of angular momentum the galactic center is a caustic point .",
    "when angular momentum is present , that caustic point spreads into a set of inner caustic rings .",
    "fig.[fig : ts ] shows the appearance of such an inner caustic ring for the case of axial symmetry .",
    "the fact that the caustic appears has nothing to do with axial symmetry however .",
    "rather , it is a consequence of the fact that when a sphere is turned `` inside out '' , as illustrated in fig.[fig : ts ] , a ring singularity must appear on the surface at some point during the process .",
    "generally , the caustic ring appears near the place where the particles with the most angular momentum on a given turn - around sphere turn back at their distance of closest approach to the galactic center .",
    "outer caustics at the earth s location are likely to be very much degraded by scattering of the dark matter particles off inhomogeneities in the galaxy .",
    "however , inner caustics associated with particles which have gone through the central parts of the galaxy only a small number of times in the past are not much degraded .",
    "the dark matter density on earth could be much enhanced if we happen to be close to an inner caustic .      in this study ,",
    "when obtaining estimates of the average sizes and of the velocity magnitudes of the velocity peaks , we neglect the velocity dispersion @xmath50 the cold dark matter has when it falls onto the galaxy for the first time . presumably , this is a valid approximation provided @xmath50 is much smaller than the velocity dispersion @xmath51 of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "we argue in this section that this condition is probably satisfied although we will not attempt to provide a reliable estimate for the size of @xmath50 .",
    "the width @xmath52 of the velocity peaks due to particles falling in and out of the galaxy for the @xmath32-th time , where @xmath32 is sufficiently small that the broadening effect of scattering of the particles by the galaxy s inhomogeneities can be neglected , is related to @xmath50 by liouville s theorem : @xmath53^{1/3}$ ] where @xmath54 is the contribution to the local halo density from particles in the @xmath32-th peak , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the velocity dispersion and density those particles had at the time @xmath57 of their first turn - around .",
    "let us emphasize that the values of the peak widths @xmath52 may some day be measured in a direct cdm detection experiment and that such data would provide information about our universe which is not readily accessible by other means .",
    "also , if the widths of some peaks are small enough the sensitivity of the cavity detector of dark matter axions is improved by looking for narrow peaks . in the case of the present llnl experiment @xcite ,",
    "which does look for narrow peaks in addition to looking for a signal whose width is set by the galaxy s overall velocity dispersion @xmath51 , the sensitivity of the search is improved if there is a velocity peak with @xmath52 less than about @xmath58 and with a fraction of the local density larger than about 1% .    turning to the question how large @xmath50 may be ,",
    "let us start by describing the _ primordial _ velocity dispersion which is the contribution that is present even if the universe were completely homogeneous , i.e. , it is the value of @xmath50 if our galaxy were the only density perturbation in the universe . for wimps ,",
    "the primordial velocity dispersiom @xmath59 is due to the finite temperature @xmath60 the wimps have when their kinetic energies decouple from the primordial heat bath .",
    "thus @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the wimp mass , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the scale factors at temperature @xmath60 and now . for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,",
    "one has @xmath67 which is very small . for axions ,",
    "the primordial velocity dispersion is due to the inhomogeneity of the axion field at temperature @xmath68 1 gev and time @xmath69 sec when the axion mass becomes equal to the hubble expansion rate .",
    "if there is no inflation after the peccei - quinn phase transition at which the @xmath70 symmetry gets spontaneously broken , then the scale of inhomogeneity of the axion field is of order the horizon scale at time @xmath71 and the primordial axion velocity dispersion today is therefore @xmath72 .",
    "if there is inflation after the peccei - quinn phase transition , then the axion field gets homogenized over enormous distances and @xmath73 is exponentially small .    the primordial velocity dispersion , @xmath59 or @xmath73 , discussed in the preceding paragraph is the thickness of the cdm phase space sheet .",
    "it constitutes a lower bound on the velocity dispersion @xmath50 of infalling cdm .",
    "additional velocity dispersion is expected because the phase space sheet may wrap itself up on smaller scales than that of the galaxy as a whole , as illustrated in fig.[fig : phsi2 ] .",
    "the phase space sheet wraps itself up wherever an overdensity has grown by gravitational instability past the linear regime ( @xmath74 ) into the non - linear one ( @xmath75 ) . in theories of structure formation based upon",
    "cold dark matter , the spectrum of primordial density perturbations is flat , i.e. , it has approximately equal power on all length scales .",
    "the matter density perturbations do not grow till the time @xmath76 of equality between the matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "after @xmath76 , all density perturbations which have wavelength less than the horizon ( this includes all length scales of order a galaxy size ) grow together at the same rate and therefore they all reach the non - linear regime at approximately the same time . in the standard cdm cosmology ,",
    "the smaller scale clumps reach the non - linear regime somewhat earlier because the processed spectrum of density perturbations is not exactly flat on galaxy scales but is slightly tilted with more power on small scales .",
    "what happens in the non - linear regime is far from obvious .",
    "the rate of growth of an overdensity in the non - linear regime is of order @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is its mean density .",
    "indeed @xmath79 is of order the free infall time , which is also the time necessary to produce a new fold in the phase space sheet . at the start of the non - linear regime ,",
    "as we just argued , all overdensities have densities of the same order of magnitude and they therefore grow at comparable rates by locally wrapping up the phase space sheet",
    ". however , overdensities of large physical size will tidally disrupt and therfore inhibit the growth of overdensities of smaller physical size in their neighborhood . in the immediate vicinity of our galaxy , there are no visible overdensities other than nearby dwarf galaxies such as the magellanic clouds .",
    "dark matter and accompanying baryons are nonetheless falling onto the galaxy now for the first time . it is the velocity dispersion of this unseen matter that we are interested in . if this matter is in large clumps , one might expect it to light up stars and thus become visible . on the other hand",
    ", it could be in clumps which have not lit up for some reason .",
    "however , any known object smaller than a galaxy ( e.g. stars , globular clusters , large molecular clouds , dwarf galaxies ) has velocity dispersion smaller than @xmath80 , and dark matter objects should be expected to be less clumped than baryonic objects because they can not dissipate their energy . on this basis",
    ", it seems safe to assume that @xmath50 is considerably less than @xmath81 .",
    "there is a particular kind of clumpiness which is expected to affect axion dark matter if there is no inflation after the peccei - quinn phase transition .",
    "this is due to the fact that cold dark matter axions are inhomogeneous with @xmath82 over the horizon scale at temperature @xmath68 1 gev when they are produced at the start of the qcd phase - transition , combined with the fact that their velocities are so small that they do not erase these inhomogeneities by free - streaming before the time @xmath76 when matter perturbations can start to grow .",
    "these particular inhomogeneities in the axion dark matter are immediately in the non - linear regime after time @xmath76 and thus form clumps , called `` axion mini - clusters '' @xcite . these have @xcite mass @xmath83 and size @xmath84 cm , and therefore their associated velocity dispersion @xmath85 at time @xmath76 .",
    "this velocity dispersion increases by about a factor 10 from @xmath76 till the onset of galaxy formation because of the hierarchical clustering of the axion mini - clusters .",
    "this yields @xmath86 as the contribution of mini - clusters to the velocity dispersion @xmath50 of infalling axions if there is no inflation after the peccei - quinn transition .",
    "the tool we use to obtain estimates of the sizes and the velocity magnitudes of the highest energy peaks is the secondary infall model of galactic halo formation . in its original form",
    ", this model is based on the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the dark matter is non - dissipative 2 .",
    "it has negligible initial velocity dispersion 3 .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galaxy is spherically symmetric and is dominated by the dark matter contribution 4 .",
    "the dark matter particles move on radial orbits through the galactic center .",
    "assumption 1 means that the only force acting upon the dark matter particles is the gravitational pull of the galaxy .",
    "assumption 2 states that before the galaxy starts to form , at some initial time @xmath87 , all the dark matter particles at the same position @xmath88 relative to the galactic center move with the same velocity @xmath89 .",
    "provided @xmath87 is chosen early enough , this initial velocity is given by the hubble expansion : @xmath90 @xmath91 is the hubble rate at time @xmath87 .",
    "the issue of the validity of assumption 2 is discussed at length in the previous section .",
    "henceforth , we will take its validity for granted .",
    "assumption 3 is realistic because the gravitational potential of a galaxy as a whole ( luminous plus dark matter ) is nearly spherically symmetric even if the distribution of its luminous matter is not spherically symmetric at all .",
    "assumption 4 is the most doubtful . as was discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the rotating disks of spiral galaxies show that their baryons carry angular momentum and one should expect the dark matter to have similar amounts of angular momentum and hence to move on non - radial orbits with distances of closest approach to the galactic center at least of order the radius ( @xmath92 kpc ) of the disk .",
    "assumption 4 is motivated mainly by simplicity .",
    "below , in the next subsection , we will generalize the model to rid it of this assumption .",
    "for clarity , we refer to the model with the fourth assumption included as the radial infall model .",
    "let us call @xmath93 the mass inside @xmath94 at the initial time @xmath87 . in a perfectly homogeneous and flat universe",
    ", @xmath93 is equal to @xmath95 if we take @xmath87 to be in the matter dominated epoch . instead , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a spherically symmetric overdensity .",
    "the dark matter shell which is initially at radius @xmath94 has initially the radial velocity @xmath98 assuming that @xmath87 is small enough so that the very earliest deviations from perfect hubble flow may be neglected .",

    "so far , the rotation curves of individual galaxies have been measured , and have been found to be flat , up to distances of order 100 kpc , implying masses of order @xmath333 or larger .",

    "we found that the effect of angular momentum is to deplete the inner parts of the halo with the result that the halo contribution to the rotation curve goes to zero at @xmath125 .",
    "the model establishes a direct relation between the amount of angular momentum and the effective core radius @xmath19 , defined as the radius at which the halo contributes half of the rotation velocity squared .",

    "for each incoming peak there is an outgoing peak with approximately the same kinetic energy and average local density .",
