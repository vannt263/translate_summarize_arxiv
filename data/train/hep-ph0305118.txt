    "in a recent work  @xcite , a pfesr analysis of the flavor @xmath1 two - point v - a current correlator , @xmath8 , was performed .",
    "this allowed extraction of the dimension six v - a ope coefficient , @xmath9 , which is related by chiral symmetry to the @xmath4 matrix element of the electroweak penguin operator , @xmath10 . the result for @xmath9 led directly to an improved determination of @xmath11 in the chiral limit .",
    "the current paper is devoted to a more detailed account of this analysis . in it , we present the rationale for our choice of weight functions , describe the calculation of higher dimension ope contributions , and discuss the relation of our work to previous treatments of the v - a correlator . advantages of the particular version of the fesr formulation employed in our analysis are pointed out .",
    "we recall that non - strange hadronic @xmath2 decay data provide access to the spectral functions of the flavor @xmath1 vector ( v ) and axial vector ( a ) current correlators  @xcite . with @xmath12 the standard v , a currents and the standard definitions of the spin @xmath13 parts of the correlators , @xmath14 the ratios @xmath15 } { \\gamma [ \\tau^- \\rightarrow \\nu_\\tau",
    "e^- { \\bar \\nu}_e ( \\gamma ) ] } , \\label{one}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath16 indicating additional photons or lepton pairs ) are expressible as weighted integrals over the corresponding spectral functions @xmath17 . working",

    "@xcite in what follows .    , and @xmath26 is the @xmath1 ckm matrix element  , has been dropped in writing this equation since it cancels in the @xmath27 difference which is the subject of this paper . ] .",
    "since the integrals over the @xmath28 part of the spectral function are saturated by the pion pole contribution , up to numerically negligible corrections of @xmath29 , non - strange hadronic @xmath2 decay data provide detailed information on the sum @xmath30 . for states containing only pions",
    ", g - parity allows an unambiguous separation of the v and a components of this sum . in the range where the decay to states containing kaon pairs is negligible ( say @xmath31 ) , the individual v and a terms , and hence also the difference @xmath32-@xmath33 , are thus known very accurately from experiment .",
    "knowledge of the v and a spectral functions allows access to the corresponding correlators through the use of either dispersion relations or fesr s .",
    "the latter may be taken to have the form @xmath34 valid for any @xmath35 analytic in the region of the contour , and any @xmath36 without kinematic singularities .",
    "an example is the standard ope representation of @xmath37  @xcite , @xmath38 \\ , , \\label{taufesr}\\ ] ] which results from the application of eq .",

    ". there exist several strategies , however , to minimize the impact of this assumption :    * work at the highest possible @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the maximum value of @xmath49 for which @xmath42 is experimentally known . at high @xmath39",
    ", one has increased confidence in the reliability of the ope .",
    "one can check the stability of any nominal ope output against changes in @xmath39 to assess theoretical uncertainties associated with possible ope breakdown . *",
    "work in the vicinity of certain ` optimal ' @xmath39 values @xmath50 , called _ duality points _",
    "the set of all such @xmath50 is nothing but the zeros of @xmath46 $ ] for certain special weight choices . by `` special ''",
    "is meant that the zeros can be determined independent of the values of any unknown ope condensates .",
    "for example , the weights @xmath51 and @xmath52 are special for the v - a correlator , since the @xmath53 and @xmath54 ope contributions are known to be zero in the chiral limit ( this is the ope statement of the two weinberg sum rules ( wsr s )  @xcite ) . in general , the sets of zeros of @xmath46 $ ] for different correlators and/or different weights are different + see , for example , figure 1 of ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "the duality point approach relies on the observation that , for the v - a correlator , the @xmath51 duality points lie close to the corresponding @xmath52 duality points ( two such points exist in the interval @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is taken to suggest the possibility that the zeros of @xmath46 $ ] for _ all _ @xmath35 might be ( approximately ) the same .",
    "if so , sum rules based on other weights would be reasonably satisfied at the @xmath51 , @xmath52 duality points .",
    "such sum rules , restricted to these values of @xmath39 , could then be used to extract unknown ope coefficients .",
    "however , the uncertainty about how close the true duality point for a given sum rule is to that for the @xmath56 sum rules will produce a corresponding uncertainty in the extracted ope coefficients .",
    "this uncertainty can be large if the @xmath39 dependence of the corresponding spectral integrals is strong ( as it is , for example , for the weights @xmath57 with @xmath58 ) .",
    "* work with ` pinched weights ' , i.e. , those satisfying @xmath59 .",
    "such weights suppress ope contributions from the region of the contour near the timelike real axis where @xmath60 $ ] is expected to be largest  @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 $ ] will then be small at those scales , @xmath39 , for which the region of ope breakdown , on the contour @xmath61 , is restricted to the vicinity of the timelike point .",
    "if the region of scales for which this is true extends down as far as the experimentally accessible region , one can find a window of @xmath39 values within which the data - based spectral integrals admit an ope - like representation ( as given by the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ basicfesr2 ] ) ) for suitable choices of the unknown qcd parameters ( i.e. the appropriate ope condensates ) .",
    "a successful ope / data match implies that @xmath46 $ ] is not detectable , within experimental errors , in the given analysis window .",
    "the analysis window then represents an extended duality _ interval _ , since every point in it , in the sense of the terminology above , is a duality point .",
    "moreover , working with weights which differ significantly in the ways they weight the experimental spectral data , but whose integrated ope contributions involve the same set of qcd parameters , allows one to perform additional checks",
    ".    we shall follow the last of these approaches and employ pfesr s to analyze the @xmath1 v - a correlator .",
    "evidence in support of this choice can be inferred from the results of fesr studies of the flavor @xmath1 v and a correlators , where one knows with good accuracy both the data and the ope integrals for @xmath39 above @xmath62 .",
    "these studies show that fesr s based on the _ unpinched _ weights , @xmath57 ( @xmath63 ) , are rather poorly satisfied over the range @xmath64@xcite ( _ i.e. _ , at these scales , @xmath65 $ ] is typically large ) . in contrast , the fesr predictions , eq .  ( [ taufesr ] ) , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are obtained by taking the appropriate linear combinations of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 fesr s , with @xmath39 set equal to @xmath70 and @xmath71 $ ] to zero , are in extremely good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the failure of the @xmath72-weighted fesr s is a manifestation of the breakdown of the ope representation near the timelike real @xmath49 axis for insufficiently large @xmath39 , as shown by poggio , quinn and weinberg ( pqw )  @xcite .",
    "the success of the ope predictions for @xmath37 presumably arises from the suppression of this danger region by the ( double ) zeros of the kinematic weights at @xmath73 ( the edge of hadronic phase space ) .",
    "it turns out that for any weight of the form either @xmath74 or @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 arbitrary and @xmath77 ) , the corresponding @xmath37-like pfesr is extremely well satisfied for all @xmath39 in the range @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that for the separate v and a correlators , and for such `` intermediate '' scales , the ope breakdown is closely localized to the vicinity of the timelike real axis . at these scales",
    ", it appears safe to neglect @xmath46 $ ] also for other correlators provided @xmath78 satisfies @xmath79 , _ but not otherwise_. a more detailed discussion of these issues may be found in section  [ sect : dualityviolation ] .      in this paper",
    "we focus on the difference @xmath80=@xmath81 of the @xmath82 components of the flavor @xmath1 v and a correlators . in the chiral limit , its ope is purely non - perturbative , with contributions beginning at dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath83 means that the physical ope will be dominated by @xmath3 ( and higher ) terms , at least until one gets to extremely large scales .",
    "accurate data for the associated spectral function @xmath84 thus allow the extraction of various vacuum condensate combinations .",
    "of particular interest are the two condensates appearing in the @xmath3 part of @xmath85_{\\rm ope}$ ] , which turn out to determine the chiral limit values of the @xmath4 matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operators @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath87 terms in @xmath85_{\\rm ope}$ ] , which enter dispersive sum rules for these matrix elements  @xcite , are also of phenomenological interest since a determination of their values would allow the dispersive determination of ref .",

    "we will extract the higher dimension ( @xmath88 ) terms appearing in the ope of @xmath80 by constructing a set of pfesr s designed in such a way as to minimize the impact of experimental errors . as we will show below ,",

    "an expanded discussion of the issue of duality violation is given in section  [ sect : dualityviolation ] .",
    "this section also contains an outline of the techniques we have employed to test for the presence of possible residual duality violation in our analysis of the v - a correlator .",
    "certain details of these tests which are relevant to the comparison to earlier work are deferred to the appendix .",
    "our conclusions , together with a brief discussion , are given in section  [ sect : concl ] .",

    "pinched weights with only a single zero at @xmath118 will weight the experimental number distribution and errors with a factor which diverges as @xmath119 for @xmath39 near @xmath70 .",
    "such behavior is to be avoided if one wishes to keep the errors on the weighted spectral integrals under control .",
    "for this reason we restrict our attention in the following to pfesr s based on polynomial weights of the form @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) . though this restriction is forced on us by necessity , it has the virtue of enforcing a stronger suppression of ope contributions from the vicinity of the timelike real axis , and hence of improving the reliability of the ope side of the pfesr s .",
    "an important practical consideration in choosing pfesr weights is the non - positive definiteness of @xmath84 .",
    "even with the very precise data below @xmath122 , weighted integrals which involve significant cancellations between contributions from the regions of positive and negative @xmath84 will have much larger fractional errors than would be expected based only on the accuracy of the spectral data alone .",

    "we emphasize that it is the strong slope of the data integrals with respect to @xmath39 which is particularly problematic for the duality point approach .",
    "the possibility of the existence of a reasonably narrow @xmath39 region within which the actual duality points of a number of differently - weighted fesr s might lie is not itself implausible .",

    "the latter are not necessarily negligible . as a first indication of this ,",
    "let us observe that mha predicts the duality points for the various @xmath72-weighted fesr s ( those @xmath39 for which the model and data integrals match ) to be different    this can be seen , for example , by superimposing the plots for the @xmath329 and @xmath313 moments ( the top panels of figs .",

    ", the high quality of the match between the optimized ope representation and the corresponding spectral integrals is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the validity of this assumption . in this section",
    "we discuss additional evidence in its favor .",
    "we begin by reviewing certain relevant aspects of what is known about the nature of duality violation in qcd .",
    "a useful review of the current status of our understanding of duality violation in qcd is given in ref .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that duality violation may be small in weighted spectral integrals even when the level of duality violation in the spectral function itself is large over significant portions , or even all , of the integration range    examples are the spectral integrals corresponding to ( i ) dispersion representations of correlators for spacelike @xmath334 , ( ii ) borel transformed dispersion relations involving borel masses @xmath335 and ( iii ) the @xmath336-weighted ( @xmath337 ) pfesr s for the flavor @xmath1 v and a correlators at scales @xmath338 to @xmath117 gev@xmath225 .    .",
    "two distinct types of duality violation _ in the spectral function _ are identified in ref .",
    "the first is that produced by contributions to the correlator which , asymptotically , are exponentially suppressed relative to ope contributions for spacelike @xmath128 .",
    "such terms behave asymptotically as @xmath339 , and hence acquire oscillating imaginary parts for timelike @xmath126 .",
    "the second type of duality violation occurs in @xmath340 qcd , where the spectrum consists of a tower of infinitely narrow resonances . as a result of this spectral structure",
    ", the associated correlator has a different convergent laurent expansion in each of the annuli lying between successive poles in the complex @xmath49-plane . in none of these",
    "annuli is the laurent expansion equal to the asymptotic expansion ; hence duality violation exists , in this case , in all such annuli .",
    "an important difference in the nature of duality violation in these two cases lies in the structure of the duality violating contributions to the correlator in the complex plane . in the @xmath340 scenario ,",
    "one has a series of different `` sub - asymptotic '' expansions , each valid in a different annulus .",
    "when one crosses from one annulus to the next , all laurent coefficients are altered , and for no annulus are they equal to the corresponding asymptotic ope coefficients .",
    "duality violation in a given annulus is thus equally large at all points on the circle @xmath61 lying within the given annulus , and is not localized to the vicinity of the timelike point on that circle for any @xmath39 , no matter how large .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath341 ( with @xmath342 corresponding to the top ( bottom ) of the physical cut ) , a term of the form @xmath343 behaves as @xmath344 \\ , \\mbox{exp}\\left [ i\\left ( \\kappa \\phi /2 + \\sin(\\phi /2)\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] and hence retains an exponential suppression , via the factor @xmath345 $ ] , for all but the timelike point on @xmath61 .",
    "this suppression will remain quite significant over most of the circle for scales @xmath39 larger than @xmath346",
    ". this may be the case even if the oscillating , duality - violating component of the spectral function is far from negligible at the same @xmath39 .",
    "duality violation via such terms is thus pqw - like : `` intermediate '' scales exist for which duality violation in the correlator ( @xmath347 ) is strongly localized to the vicinity of the timelike real axis .",
    "the two distinct patterns of duality violation for a given correlator in the complex plane manifest themselves in readily distinguishable different ways in sum rule analyses .",
    "in particular , these patterns suggest different strategies and tests to explore the impact of duality violation in a given analysis . in this section",
    "we identify such strategies and enumerate a number of possible tests . in the next section",
    ", we then specialize to the flavor @xmath1 v - a correlator , and we discuss the practical implementation of these tests .    in presence of a pqw - like component of duality violation , there will exist intermediate scales @xmath39 where    * power - weighted ( @xmath57 ) fesr s , which fail to suppress contributions from the integral over @xmath61 near the timelike axis , are poorly satisfied ; * pfesr s involving weights which suppress contributions from the vicinity of the timelike point are well satisfied .",
    "this observation motivates the use of  pinched weights  in fesr analyses to tame pqw - like duality violation .",
    "having adopted a set of weights , one wants to verify that residual duality violating contributions from the region near @xmath118 are not present in the results of the analysis . in this respect ,",
    "an important test is to    * verify that the ( nominally asymptotic ) @xmath140 coefficients extracted in the pfesr analysis provide accurate representations , not only of the spectral integrals used in fitting the @xmath140 , but also of spectral integrals corresponding to weights with zeros of a higher order at @xmath118 ( which therefore further suppress pqw - like duality violating effects ) .    in the @xmath340-like scenario , where duality violation is not localized to the vicinity of the timelike real axis , a rather different pattern of sum rule behavior will be observed . since ope - like",
    "laurent expansions exist in any given annulus , so long as one restricts oneself to @xmath39 lying in a single annulus , one will obtain a set of coefficients , @xmath140 , which provide a perfect match between the `` ope '' and data sides of both power - weighted and pinch - weighted fesr s at those scales .",
    "that set will , of course , consist of just the coefficients of those terms in the laurent expansion for the given annulus which survive when integrated against the weights employed . if one performs the same basic analysis ( i.e. , using the same set of weights ) , but now for @xmath39 lying entirely in a different annulus , one will obtain a different set of @xmath140 .",
    "these @xmath140 will provide a perfect match between the `` ope '' and data sides of the sum rules employed in the new annulus .",
    "schematically , this type of duality violating contribution implies :    * the existence of several sub - asymptotic regimes ; * that pinching is not effective in removing this type of duality violating effect ( both pinch - weighted and power - weighted fesr s are equally well satisfied in each sub - asymptotic region ) .    the existence of several such sub - asymptotic regimes in this type of scenario can also , in principle , be exposed in a pfesr analysis , as follows . starting with some particular small range of @xmath39 one",
    "may gradually decrease the lower edge of the @xmath39 analysis window , keeping the upper edge fixed .",
    "so long as the lower edge lies in the same annulus as the upper edge , a pfesr analysis extraction of ope - like coefficients , obtained by means of matching to spectral integral data , will produce an exact determination of the relevant coefficients in the singular part of the laurent expansion for that annulus .",
    "as soon as the lower edge of the @xmath39 analysis window leaves the single annulus , however , there is no longer a single set of expansion coefficients valid for all the @xmath39 being employed .",
    "the existence of such a two - annulus regime will be evident by the sudden appearance of a poor match between the optimized ope - like integral and spectral integral sets .",
    "one can check these expectations explicitly within the equal - spacing pole model of refs .",
    "this exercise shows that , in performing a pfesr analysis , it is crucial to    * demonstrate that there is no drift in the values of the extracted coefficients as one decreases the lower edge of the @xmath39 analysis window and * demonstrate that the optimized values of the fit parameters in fact produce an accurate match to the spectral integral data used to produce the fit _ over the whole of the @xmath39 analysis window employed_.    these tests serve not only to verify the reliability of the assumed ope - like expansion form , but also , at least potentially , to expose the existence of multiple sub - asymptotic expansion regimes    one may also test whether an observed deterioration in the quality of the optimized `` ope''/spectral integral match as @xmath39 is lowered is , or is not , due to the existence of a new subasymptotic regime .",
    "if it is , then the first @xmath39 for which the deterioration appears must lie in the lower annulus . working with @xmath39 lying in a narrow range just below this point",
    "should then produce a new set of fitted @xmath140 which provide a good quality representation of the corresponding spectral integrals , when restricted to this new range of @xmath39 .",
    "if a good quality match is not found , then the deterioration is due to breakdown of the ope - like expansion form , and not to the fact that one has entered a new subasymptotic region .    .",
    "in the context of the @xmath340 discussion , however , it is clear that , while passing these tests is a _ necessary _ condition for the reliability of the extraction of the ope coefficients from data , it is not a _ sufficient _ one : if one happened to be unlucky and perform the pfesr analysis only for those @xmath39 lying in a single , but sub - asymptotic , annulus , one would see a high quality match ( exact in the case of the pole model ) between the spectral integrals and optimized ope - like integrals even though one would have actually extracted the coefficients relevant to the laurent expansion in the sub - asymptotic annulus , and not those relevant to the asymptotic regime . a simple way to test whether or not this is the case is to    * take the coefficients extracted in the pfesr analysis and employ them as input to a dispersive analysis _ relevant to the asymptotic regime_.",
    "if the coefficients extracted in the pfesr analysis are not those relevant to the asymptotic regime , the resulting dispersive integrals will be poorly approximated by the ope - like representation generated using the fitted coefficients .",
    "again , explicit illustrations of this point can be worked out within the equal - spacing pole model of refs .  @xcite . in the case of the model , performing the dispersive test is straightforward because the spectral function of the model is actually known for all @xmath49 .",
    "the situation of interest to us , however , is one where spectral data are available for only a limited range of @xmath49 .",
    "in such a situation , it would typically be difficult to construct a dispersive test for which the errors on the dispersive integrals were under sufficient control to make the test useful .",
    "one general solution is to work with bsr s and restrict one s attention to borel masses which are both low enough that the spectral weight , @xmath348 , is negligible in the region where spectral data are absent and , simultaneously , high enough that the convergence with @xmath41 of the borel transformed ope series _ for the set of @xmath140 one wishes to test _ is acceptable . for a given bsr , such @xmath297 may or may not exist .",
    "three of the four iz bsr s turn out to provide examples of such tests for our solution set ( details are reported in the appendix ) .",
    "additional asymptotic tests , involving bsr s at larger @xmath297 , are possible for the flavor @xmath1 v - a correlator . in this case , the spectral integral uncertainties are brought under control using the classical chiral sum rule constraints associated with the weinberg sum rules and the sum rule for the @xmath114 electromagnetic mass splitting . an efficient procedure for implementing these constraints",
    "is provided by the `` residual weight method '' , which is described in detail in ref .",

    "ideally one would like to work at scales well above @xmath368 , in order to suppress , as much as possible , any residual duality violating contributions which might be present , but masked by current experimental errors . while current errors are small enough that @xmath9 may still be determined , even if one works with only a small portion of our present analysis window    for example , using only @xmath369 and @xmath286 , one finds , from the maximally - safe analysis of the aleph data , @xmath370 , where the error quoted is that associated with the aleph covariance matrix .",
    "the error is , of course , significantly larger than that obtained from the larger analysis window , but still less than @xmath184 of the signal .",
    ", this is not true for the @xmath140 with @xmath371 .",
    "in fact , with current experimental errors , the uncertainties on the extracted @xmath371 @xmath140 do not become smaller than @xmath372 , until the lower edge of the analysis window has been reduced to below @xmath373 . if , as an example , we perform our analysis of the aleph data using the @xmath374 and @xmath375 sub - window , then , with central values for all non - spectral input , the maximally - safe output for @xmath9 and @xmath185 is : a_6 & = & - ( 3.88 1.21 ) 10 ^ -3 gev^6 + a_8 & = & - ( 9.32 6.58 ) 10 ^ -3 gev^8  . within the quoted errors , these results are compatible with those of the full - window analysis .",
    "the situation is similar for the results of the combined analysis : the results of the sub - window analysis for @xmath271 through @xmath376 are : a_10 & = & ( 6.62 2.83 ) 10 ^ -2 gev^10 + a_12 & = & - ( 2.160.86 ) 10 ^ -1 gev^12 + a_14 & = & ( 5.882.48 ) 10 ^ -1 gev^14 + a_16 & = & - ( 1.470.69 ) gev^16  , again compatible with the full - window analysis within the sub - window analysis errors . were the errors to be @xmath377 as large , however , the full - window and sub - window results would no longer be compatible and we would be forced to conclude that residual duality violation was present for those @xmath39 in the lower part of the full analysis window .",
    "we stress that there is no reason for reaching such a conclusion at present .",
    "in fact , there are strong reasons for trusting the results of the full - window analysis :    * where the existence of duality violation can be explicitly demonstrated , the ope - like expansion is known _ not _ to provide a good representation of the spectral integrals ; * in the lower part of our full analysis window the ope - like form provides an excellent representation of the spectral integrals ; * the combined fit from the full analysis window provides an excellent representation of the spectral integrals not only in the lower part , but also the upper part , of the analysis window ; * the combined fit results obtained from _ the sub - window version of the analysis _ turn out to provide a poor representation of the spectral integrals in the lower part of the full window .",
    "nonetheless , the size of the sub - window errors are such that much stronger tests of the absence of residual duality violation , using various sub - windows , will become possible once the errors on @xmath361 above @xmath122 are reduced    if such reduced errors were to expose residual duality violation in the lower part of the current full - window analysis , one would of course be forced to raise the lower edge of the analysis window .    .",
    "while it seems unlikely to us , for the reasons given above , it is not at present possible to conclusively rule out additional uncertainties , associated with residual duality violating , at the level of the difference of the full - window and sub - window analysis central @xmath140 values .",
    "in this paper we have used finite energy sum rules with `` pinched - weights '' ( pfesr s ) to determine the ope coefficients @xmath0 of the flavor @xmath1 v - a correlator with good accuracy using existing hadronic @xmath2 decay data .",
    "while it is not possible at present to either prove or disprove on _ rigorous _ analytic grounds that this approach ( or any other ) yields a valid approximation to the actual dynamics of qcd , we have carefully demonstrated the advantages of pfesr s among the class of sum rule techniques and have described a large number of checks on our own work and that of others .    at a technical level , we have employed a set of ten polynomial weights carefully chosen to minimize the impact of experimental errors and of duality violating effects , as well as to optimally separate the contributions from condensate combinations of different dimension .",
    "our analysis shows that the ope contributions with @xmath6 are typically not negligible at scales @xmath378 .",
    "we have performed a number of tests to explore the presence of duality violating effects in our analysis .",
    "these support the conclusion that our combined fit values are not affected by duality violation within the existing experimentally induced errors .",
    "we recall the main observations in support of this statement :    * independent determinations of the @xmath140 using pfesr s based on different ( independent ) weights are in excellent agreement ; * the results of the combined fit for the @xmath140 lead to an extremely good match between the ope and spectral integral sides of all the pfesr s employed in the fitting procedure ; * the combined fit values also lead to extremely good matches for the @xmath379 spectral weight pfesr s , where @xmath6 contributions are much larger relative to @xmath265 contributions than is the case for the @xmath256 through @xmath217 pfesr s ; * there is no deterioration in the quality of the combined fit prediction for the pfesr spectral integrals even for those spectral weights with zeros at @xmath118 of much higher order than those used in obtaining the combined fit ; * the dispersive tests , described above , and in the appendix , are successfully passed by our solution set .",
    "this provides additional support for the reliability of the extracted values , and our interpretation of them as asymptotic ope coefficients of the v - a correlator .",
    "improved experimental data would allow one to significantly sharpen some of the tests reported above",
    ".    some general observations also follow from the results and discussion above . first , the ope representation of @xmath359 , with the @xmath140 given by the combined fit values of either eq .",
    "( [ finalresults ] ) or eqs .",
    "( [ finalresultsopal ] ) , provides a very accurate representation of the corresponding spectral integrals down to scales as low as @xmath380 , at least for pfesr s based on weights with a double zero at @xmath118 .",
    "this suggests that the ope remains reliable at intermediate scales , @xmath381 , apart perhaps from a region near the timelike real axis .",
    "in contrast , if one considers weights which do not suppress contributions from this region , one sees clear evidence for the breakdown of the ope .",
    "the situation is similar to that for the flavor @xmath1 v and a correlators .",
    "the double zeros of the pfesr weights at @xmath118 in the v - a case evidently again provide sufficiently strong suppression in the vicinity of the timelike real axis to efficiently remove contributions from the region of ope breakdown on the circle @xmath61 .",
    "a second point concerns the relative sizes of the various @xmath140 .",
    "the results of the combined fit indicate that @xmath382 is typically of order @xmath383 for the v - a correlator .",
    "this means that , at intermediate ( @xmath384 ) scales , there is no ` natural ' ordering of contributions with different @xmath41 , in the sense that pfesr weights with comparable coefficients for the @xmath385 and @xmath386 terms in @xmath78 will produce comparable @xmath387 and @xmath388 contributions to the pfesr ope integrals .",
    "this makes explicit the danger of neglecting terms with @xmath6 for pfesr s based on @xmath78 with degree greater than @xmath117 .",
    "this observation also raises the possibility that the analogous neglect of higher @xmath41 terms in other pfesr analyses , such as those used to extract @xmath389 from the flavor - breaking difference of @xmath1 and @xmath146 v+a correlators  @xcite , may suffer from similar problems .",

    "this is done using the extensions to higher @xmath209 of the families of weights of which @xmath218 and @xmath217 are members ( recall that these weights produce @xmath88 ope contributions proportional to either @xmath9 and @xmath208 or @xmath185 and @xmath208 ) .",

    "one finds that the ope sides of the bsr s may be safely truncated , as can be seen from table  [ tablenew ] . as in turns out , the additional ( @xmath405 ) terms play a role in the full ope sum only for the third of the iz sum rules . in none of the four cases",

    "are the predictions corresponding to the iz solution .",
    "note that the second of the four sum rules has been used by iz to obtain their quoted value for @xmath9 .",
    "the errors quoted for the combined fit @xmath3 through @xmath406 sum are obtained using the covariance matrix for the solution set , generated from covariance matrix of the aleph data    because there are significant cancellations amongst the @xmath88 contributions , and strong correlations among the combined fit values for the @xmath140 , it is crucial to employ the full covariance matrix for the solution in determining the uncertainties on the combined fit predictions shown in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the fact that , at the low values of @xmath297 for which the spectral integral errors are under control , the ope sides of the iz bsr s turn out to involve a complicated cancellation between a large number of terms of different dimension , in fact means that it would not be possible to disentangle such contributions using a bsr analysis .    .",
    "as is evident from the table , the combined fit predictions are in excellent agreement with the data , providing further support for the asymptotic nature of the coefficients extracted in the combined fit .",

    "<S> we show by appropriate weight choices that the error on the dominant @xmath3 contribution , which is known to be related to the @xmath4 matrix elements of the electroweak penguin operator in the chiral limit , may be reduced to below the @xmath5 level . </S>",
    "<S> the values we obtain for ope coefficients with @xmath6 are shown to naturally account for the discrepancies between our results for the @xmath3 and @xmath7 terms and those of previous analyses , which were obtained neglecting @xmath6 contributions . </S>"
