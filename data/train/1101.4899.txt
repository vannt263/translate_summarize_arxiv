    "hawking s computation of radiation @xcite led to a serious puzzle .",
    "the radiation quanta are created in pairs , with the emitted quantum being in an entangled state with its partner which falls into the hole . by the time the hole shrinks down to planck mass",
    ", we generate a large entanglement between the emitted radiation and the hole .",
    "we are forced to either have long lived planck mass remnants , or ( if the hole disappears completely ) a loss of unitarity ( i.e. ` information loss ' ) .    since this problem appears serious",
    ", one might wonder why there is not more effort devoted to obtaining a consensus on the issue .",
    "relativists have of course studied this problem in quite some depth .",
    "many studies suggested that ` black holes have no hair ' @xcite ; if such is the case then we are forced to assume the vacuum state at the horizon that hawking used in his emission computation , and it seems that we must go along with his discovery of monotonically rising entanglement .",
    "given this situation , several relativists have reconciled themselves either to the idea of information loss , or the scenario of slow leakage of information from long lived remnants .",
    "the penrose diagrams in some treatments of loop quantum gravity also imply a kind of remnant , since the information is released not in the hawking radiation but from a region past the nominal singularity @xcite .",
    "other treatments seek to refine our definitions of measurement in order to reconcile the density matrix obtained for the emitted quanta with the pure state expected from a unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "string theorists , on the other hand , have traditionally been less worried by this problem .",
    "weak coupling computations suggest that information comes out in the hawking radiation , since a manifestly unitary computation from a vibrating ` effective string ' reproduces exactly the greybody factory of near extremal black holes @xcite .",
    "but at the coupling needed to make black holes one still writes the traditional metric of a hole with a smooth horizon ; for example for the ads - schwarzschild hole one would write ds^2=-(r^2 + 1-cr^2)dt^2+dr^2r^2 + 1-cr^2+r^2 d_3",
    "^ 2 d_5 ^ 2 [ qfour ] now one has exactly the same problem as hawking had raised initially .",
    "so what are we supposed to do about that ?",
    "a common belief has been that while hawking did a leading order computation of the radiation , using the semiclassical metric of the hole , one should really take into account the small corrections to his computation that would result from quantum gravity effects .",
    "these corrections could be very nonlocal and bizarre , since they could arise from tunneling processes that relate one metric to a completely different one .",
    "but one thing has always been tacitly assumed : these corrections should be ` small ' in the limit @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the hole and @xmath3 is the planck mass .",
    "this requirement is imposed if we trust that the semi - classical black hole solution gives the leading order dynamics of the hole .",
    "we will see below how one should encode this smallness condition mathematically in the hawking process .",
    "even though these corrections are small , the number @xmath4 of emitted quanta is very large ( @xmath5 for a 3 + 1 dimensional schwarzschild hole ) .",
    "thus one can hope that the smallness of the corrections can be offset by the large number of quanta , in the sense that ` delicate correlations ' among these @xmath4 quanta result in a state of the radiation that is not entangled with the hole to any significant extent by the time we reach the endpoint of evaporation .",
    "this would resolve all problems : a metric like ( [ qfour ] ) would be a good semiclassical approximation , and small quantum effects would be a self consistent higher order correction that removes any information paradox at the end of the evaporation process .",
    "but if such were the case , one has to wonder why no one produced a simple model of how such correlations could produce a unitary evolution process .",
    "that is , one could start by ignoring the details of where quantum corrections really arise from , and proceed to write down a set of ` small corrections ' that would lead to a pure state of radiation after the emission of @xmath4 quanta .",
    "if such toy models could be readily made , there would indeed be no serious paradox , since we could assume that the full quantum gravity theory would choose one of these pathways to unitarity , and the details of the exact pathway would be no more than a curiosity .",
    "recently an inequality was derived which showed that there can be _ no _ such model of small corrections that will do the job of producing a pure state of the radiation @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this result in more detail below , but for now we note that this result forces us to confront the information puzzle in string theory .",
    "we can not use ` suggestive computations ' that point towards a unitary radiation process to argue away the paradox ; evolution in the metric ( [ qfour ] ) ( with arbitrary small corrections allowed ) _ forces _ us to choose between information loss and remnants .",
    "if we wish to avoid both these possibilities , we have to find a way to modify hawking s process by _ order unity _ at the horizon ; i.e. , find ` hair ' at the horizon .",
    "given the above discussion , it appears important that we understand the nature of the inequality derived in @xcite , and gain some familiarity with how it governs the growth of entanglement entropy in the black hole radiation process .",
    "a simple model encoding corrections to hawking s leading order process was presented in @xcite . in the leading order hawking process the pair created at each step is not affected by pairs created at earlier steps , or by the state of the matter that initially made the hole . in the model of @xcite",
    "each created pair was allowed a small correction that depended on the emission at the _ previous _ step .",
    "this model was simple enough that it could be solved analytically .",
    "the reduction in entanglement entropy of the radiation was small , in agreement with the general inequality of @xcite .",
    "but since the quantum gravity effects are in general unknown , we would like to allow for arbitrarily complicated corrections ; i.e. , we would like these corrections to depend in any way we choose on the state of emission at earlier steps , and on the state of the initial matter that made the hole .",
    "the only restriction we would need to keep is that the overall correction to the state of each created pair be small .",
    "we are not able to solve such general models analytically , so in this paper we proceed with a numerical computation .",
    "we look at three different models where we encode small corrections in different ways into the emission process . in each case",
    "we compute the entanglement of the emitted radiation with what is left in the hole , at different steps in the evolution process . in the leading order hawking process",
    "( i.e. when there are no corrections ) this entanglement entropy after @xmath6 steps of evolution is @xmath7 . with the corrections",
    "included , we observe that we get only a slight change ; the entanglement keeps monotonically rising with @xmath6 , and is only slightly reduced from its maximal allowed value of @xmath8 . note that if the information puzzle were to be resolved by these small corrections then we would need to find that @xmath9 starts _ reducing _ after a while , reaching near zero when we reach the endpoint of the evaporation process .",
    "we then turn to an issue that has been a source of some confusion in the information puzzle : the correlations among the photons emitted from a piece of burning paper . in this case",
    "no difficulty with unitarity is expected ; in line with the general analysis of @xcite , we expect that the entanglement of the emitted radiation with the paper at first goes up , and then goes down , reducing to zero when the paper is completely gone .",
    "we construct a model of this ` burning paper ' , and follow the evolution of @xmath9 as the evolution proceeds .",
    "we observe that @xmath9 increases , reaches a maximum , and then drops back to zero , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "having the black hole models and the model of ` burning paper ' in front of us , we can examine why the result is so different in the two cases , and thus arrive at a basic understanding of how the two radiation processes differ .",
    "this difference was discussed in @xcite , and we revisit this issue in the context of our models , making a laboratory model that has some features of the hawking radiation process , and noting the source of the crucial difference between this radiation process and radiation from normal warm bodies .    finally , we note how string theory actually gets around the information paradox .",
    "string theory black holes do have ` hair ' ; the state at the horizon is not the vacuum state , but a very different state termed a ` fuzzball ' .",
    "this resolves the information paradox since we are no longer forced to the monotonic increase of entanglement created by the stretching of the vacuum at a horizon .",
    "we are now interested in understanding the ` infall problem ' : i.e. , is there a way that heavy infalling objects ( @xmath10 ) can see a universal effective behavior in all fuzzballs , perhaps modeled by the traditional geometry of the hole ?",
    "israel @xcite had noted that the two sides of the eternal schwarzschild black hole spacetime can be regarded as the two copies of a system used in the thermo - field - dynamics description @xcite of a statistical ensemble .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that in the domain @xmath10 we can approximate correlation functions by their ensemble averaged values .",
    "if we do make this replacement then we get an ensemble sum over microstates , which ( following comments of israel @xcite , maldacena @xcite , van raamsdonk @xcite and others ) can be effectively replaced by the traditional black hole geometry possessing horizons .",
    "thus we recover a version of the idea of ` complementarity ' @xcite : the fuzzball construction of microstates creates the order unity corrections needed for low energy modes to carry information and resolve the information paradox , while measurements by energetic infalling objects can be approximated by computations in a spacetime with smooth horizons .",
    "in this section we review the nature of hawking emission , and explain the setup used to derive the inequality in @xcite .",
    "the numerical models we construct in this paper will illustrate this inequality .      consider a schwarzschild hole with metric ds^2=-(1 - 2mr)dt^2+dr^21 - 2mr+r^2 d_2 ^ 2 [ qthree ] there is no singularity at the horizon , and the full spacetime made by a collapsing shell",
    "is given by the penrose diagram shown in fig.[fthree ] .",
    "the hawking process can be examined on the smooth slices shown in the figure , which capture the evolution up to any point where the horizon is still macroscopic , without approaching the singularity anywhere . since the conformal scaling of the penrose diagram distorts the geometry of the slices , it is better to look at the slices shown in the schematic figure fig.[ftwo ] .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath11 is plotted on the horizontal axis , and the other axis is just a way to depict evolution ; it could be an eddington - finkelstein coordinate for instance .         outside the horizon and @xmath12 inside .",
    "infalling matter is very far from the place where pairs are created . ]    outside the hole we can make a spacelike slice by taking a @xmath13 surface . inside the hole , we take a @xmath14 surface .",
    "these two parts of the surface can be joined by a smooth connection region @xmath15 .",
    "to get evolution we must now construct a ` later ' slice .",
    "the @xmath13 part is simply changed to @xmath16 . inside the hole ,",
    "the forward evolution takes us to @xmath17 .",
    "since we do not wish to get close to the singularity at @xmath18 , we take @xmath19 very small , such that in the entire evolution we are interested in we never get to , say , the region @xmath20 .",
    "there is of course nothing wrong if we evolve one part of a spacelike slice forwards in time while not evolving another part of the slice ; this is just the ` many fingered time ' of general relativity .",
    "we now see that the @xmath12 part of this later slice has to be longer ",
    "it has to ` stretch '  in order that it be joined to the @xmath21 part ( we have used a connector segment with approximately the same intrinsic geometry as on the first slice ) .",
    "the stretching is gentle and smooth , with all lengthscales and timescales associated to the stretching being of order @xmath22 .",
    "this stretching thus creates pairs of quanta on the slice , with wavelengths of order @xmath22 . decomposing this state into quanta that emerge from the hole ( labelled @xmath23 ) and quanta",
    "that stay inside ( labelled @xmath24 ) , we get a state that is schematically of the form @xmath25|0\\rangle_b\\times |0\\rangle_c$ ] for each step of the evolution .",
    "the explicit form of the state can be found for example in @xcite for the 2-d black hole . for our purposes",
    "we only need to note that this state is entangled between the inner and outer members of the pair , and so for simplicity we break up the evolution into a set of discrete steps ( with time lapse @xmath26 ) , and take a simple form of the entangled state having just two terms |_pair = l_cl_b+_c_b [ pairs ] ( nothing in the argument below should be affected by this simplification , or the simplification of taking discrete timesteps .",
    "if we had a fermionic field we would in fact have just two terms in the sum . )    at the initial timestep we have on our spacelike slice only the shell that has passed through its horizon radius , denoted by a state @xmath27 . at the next time step",
    "we have , in the leading order hawking computation , the state |= |_m ( l_c_1l_b_1+_c_1_b_1 ) [ qtwoq ] if we compute the entanglement of @xmath28 with @xmath29 we obtain s_ent=2 at the next step of evolution the slice stretches so that the quanta @xmath30 move away from the middle of the ` connector region ' @xmath15 , and a new pair is pulled out of the vacuum near the center of @xmath15 . the full state is |=|_m & & ( l_c_1l_b_1+_c_1_b_1 ) & & ( l_c_2l_b_2+_c_2_b_2 ) [ qtwoq2 ] if we compute the entanglement of the set @xmath31 with @xmath32 , we find s_ent=22 [ ent2 ] continuing this process , after @xmath4 steps we get , in the leading order hawking computation , |= |_m & & ( l_c_1l_b_1+_c_1_b_1 ) & & ( l_c_2l_b_2+_c_2_b_2 ) &  & & & ( l_c_nl_b_n+_c_n_b_n ) [ qtwoq3 ] the entanglement entropy of the @xmath33 with @xmath34 is s_ent = n2 [ ent ] since this entanglement keeps growing with @xmath4 , we get the hawking problem mentioned above .",

    "thus we are just writing down in mathematical terms the requirement that the full state and the semiclassical state differ by a small amount in the local process of evolution near the horizon by one timestep of order @xmath2 ( the timescale required to create one hawking pair ) .",
    "we are _ not _ requiring that the full state of all the @xmath39 quanta be close to the one that we would obtain by semiclassical evolution . for a state made of many quanta , or in the process of evolution by many timesteps , we can get large changes from the cumulative effects of small changes",

    "in this section we make several models where we add small corrections to the leading order hawking process , and numerically compute the entanglement entropy as the evolution proceeds .",

    "the state of the newly created pair is given by @xmath61 ( eq.([set ] ) ) .",
    "this state does not depend on the matter @xmath2 which made the hole or the negative energy quanta @xmath62 that have been created at previous steps ( which are also going to be in the hole ) . for our first model , we will let the small corrections be independent of @xmath2 , but will allow a dependence on the @xmath62 .",
    "( in the model that follows we will include dependence on @xmath2 as well . ) the case where we get a correction only from the @xmath24 quantum created at the previous step was solved analytically in @xcite . in our present numerical model",
    "we will allow a very ` nonlocal ' dependence on the @xmath63 ; this means that the emission at step @xmath55 is affected not only by the @xmath24 quanta created in the last few steps , but by the @xmath24 quanta created at all previous steps .    from ( [ state ] )",
    "we see that to define the evolution with small corrections we need to find the state at timestep @xmath55 |_m , c , b(t_n+1)|_n+1= ^(1)_ns^(1)_n+1 + ^(2)_ns^(2)_n+1 [ basic1 ] where @xmath53 are given in ( [ set ] ) . thus our goal is to define @xmath64 for the model .",

    "the photons leave from the surface of the paper , and are thus typically in an entangled state with the part of the paper they leave behind .",
    "as page argued @xcite , the entanglement entropy between the radiation and the paper at first goes up , but after about half the paper has burnt away , the entanglement entropy starts going down again , reaching zero when the paper is completely converted to its radiated products .",
    "the reduction in entanglement happens for the following reason .",
    "a radiated photon may be in an entangled spin state with the atom which radiated it , but eventually this atom will also be radiated away as ash , in order for the paper to completely disappear .",
    "then the entanglement will be between two parts of the radiated energy : the radiated photon and the radiated atom .",
    "( in general interactions among the many atoms and photons in the paper will make the overall entangled state quite complicated . ) the information in the original paper is thus encoded in correlations among the radiation products , which are in an overall pure state ; they are not entangled with anything other than themselves .    in this section",
    "we make a numerical model of ` burning paper , ' and observe that the entanglement entropy in this case indeed goes up and then returns to zero . the essential difference between the black hole and the case of burning paper",
    "was explained in @xcite .",
    "we discuss this difference again , and also provide a laboratory model which is more analogous to the black hole evaporation situation .",
    "we do not distinguish between photons and atoms .",
    "we take a set of @xmath4 objects , which we call atoms for simplicity .",
    "we allow each atom to have two spin states , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the evolution is described as follows :    \\(i ) the initial state ( timestep @xmath67 ) is a wavefunction for the @xmath4 spins .",
    "let us take it to be a definite but arbitrarily chosen set of spins , for example if we have @xmath128 then we could take the state at timestep @xmath67 to be |_0=uuu[ex4 ]    \\(ii ) we imagine that the radiation takes place from the right side of this set of spins ( thus the left side is to the ` interior ' of the paper ) . to get the state at timestep @xmath113 we look at the two atoms on the rightmost end",
    ". only one of these atoms will be radiated , but the actual radiation process depends on the state of both these two spins .",
    "the rules for radiation are chosen as follows :    \\(a ) if both atoms are @xmath126 , then the radiated atom is @xmath126 and the other @xmath126 atom stays behind as the rightmost atom in the set .",
    "\\(b ) if both atoms are @xmath127 , then the radiated atom is @xmath127 and the other @xmath127 atom stays behind as the rightmost atom in the set .",
    "\\(c ) we also add rules for the case that the two rightmost atoms are up - down or down - up : u  ( u| + | u ) u  ( u| - | u )    in this way we generate an entanglement between the radiated atom and the surface of the radiating paper .",
    "we draw a vertical bar to separate the atoms which have been radiated and the atoms which are left behind . in the example ( [ ex4 ] )",
    "the two rightmost spin were @xmath129 , so we will get |_2=uuu|+uu|[ex4p ] this state is not yet the final state at timestep @xmath113 , so we have denoted it with a prime .",
    "\\(iii ) in a piece of burning paper we also have a hamiltonian which makes the atoms in the paper interact with each other .",
    "thus the entanglement between the radiation and the _ surface _ of the paper changes to an entanglement between the radiation and the _ bulk _ of the paper . in our model",
    "we take the following rule to incorporate such an effect . after every step of radiation",
    ", we perform a clockwise rotation on the spins left behind in the paper ; i.e. , the atom at the rightmost end is moved to the leftmost position , and the other atoms slide one step each to the right .",
    "thus for the example that we have taken , we get    @xmath113 .",
    "the evolution process now repeats : we look at the last two spins just before the vertical bar , use the rules ( a)-(c ) to eject another spin , perform the clockwise permutation , and then move to the next step .",
    "\\(iv ) at timestep @xmath55 , we will have @xmath6 atoms to the right of the vertical bar and @xmath130 atoms to the left of the bar .",
    "the overall state is entangled between these two sets of atoms .",
    "we trace over the atoms in the paper ( i.e. the atoms to the left of the vertical bar ) to get a reduced density matrix @xmath131 describing the atoms that have been radiated . finally , we compute s_ent(n)=-tr it is clear that @xmath9 vanishes at @xmath67 ( since there are no radiated atoms ) .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath9 will have to vanish at the final timestep @xmath132 since all atoms are to the right of the bar , and there is nothing left for them to entangle with . at timestep @xmath4",
    "there is only one spin left in the paper , and we must have @xmath133 .",
    "thus we expect the kind of behavior noted by page @xcite for all normal radiating bodies : an increase in @xmath9 , a turning point when about half the degrees of freedom have been radiated , and a return to @xmath134 when the burning process is completed .",
    "numerical results from this model are given in fig.[fn7 m ] .",
    "for two different choices of initial state , we plot @xmath9 , as a function of the timestep .",

    "the second to @xmath136.,title=\"fig:\"]1 true in   and the second to @xmath136.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we can now see how the models of black hole evaporation studied in section [ secthree ] differ in an essential way from models of burning paper . for the model of burning paper",
    ", the state generated at any timestep @xmath6 depends on the state of the atoms near the surface of the paper ; such a dependence is encoded in the rules ( a)-(c ) of section [ subfour ] .",
    "the state of the radiated atom and the atom left behind at the surface is typically an entangled one , and chosen from a vector space spanned by a few possibilities . for information to be carried out in the radiation ,",
    "it is important that this vector space has dimension greater than one . to see this fact , consider a case where this vector space was in fact 1-dimensional .",
    "for instance , we can let the ` paper ' be made of @xmath4 identical spinless bosons , all in the same state .",
    "we let one boson be emitted at each timestep , in the same state each time .",
    "now there will be no entanglement between the emitted bosons and the bosons left behind .",
    "but in such a situation there will be no information in the initial state to carry out , and there will be no information in the final state of radiated bosons either .",
    "by contrast in the model of burning paper that we have taken in section [ subfour ] , the evolution at any timestep at the surface of the paper took one of three different forms , with the probabilities of the three forms being order unity each ; i.e. it was _ not _ the case that two of the possibilities had infinitesimal amplitudes ( @xmath137 , with @xmath103 ) while the third had amplitude satisfying @xmath138 .",
    "the paper could be in one of @xmath139 states , and because the radiation process at each step depended in a nontrivial way on the state of the paper near its surface , the radiation could faithfully carry out information about the choice of initial state , in a scrambled form .",
    "let us now look again at the case of black hole evaporation , assuming as we have done in section [ secthree ] that we have a traditional horizon and therefore the state at the horizon is close to the vacuum in the ` good slicing ' .",
    "now we create particle _ pairs _ at this horizon , and these pairs are in an entangled state .",
    "but the state of the pair is chosen from an effectively 1-dimensional vector space ; i.e. it is always the state @xmath61 ( eq.([pairs ] ) ) , upto small corrections from other states .",
    "note that unlike the model of spinless bosons above , this time the radiated quanta entangle with the quanta left behind .",
    "it is the state of the _ pair _ which is taken from an effectively 1-dimensional vector space .",
    "this effectively 1-dimensional nature of the vector space creates the entanglement problem : at leading order we get the same increase in entanglement each time , since the evolution is not sensitive to any detail of the hole .",
    "the small corrections only reduce the entanglement from its leading order value by a small amount , as proved in @xcite .",
    "let us make a laboratory model that will mimic the features of such black hole evaporation .",
    "we depict this model in fig.[fn3 ] .",
    "we have a tank at temperature close to zero , filled with ` electron pairs ' ; these are entangled pairs of electrons in the state ( u- ) [ state5 ] since each pair is bosonic , we imagine the quanta in the tank to be a bose condensate of these pairs . thus there is a unique state for the entire collection of quanta in the tank . in our analogy with the black hole the store of pairs in the cold tank will represent the vacuum , from which particle pairs can be pulled out .    at each timestep of evolution , one electron pair evaporates up from the tank into a chamber , where it disassociates into its component electrons .",
    "one electron flies out to the right as ` radiation ' , while the other is collected in a box on the left .",
    "note that this produces an entangled state of the form ( [ state5 ] ) between the radiated quantum and the quantum collected in the box .    to complete the analogy with the black hole",
    ", we imagine that the box on the left starts out with a collection of @xmath2 atoms ; these represent the initial matter which made the black hole .",
    "consider the creation of any new pair from the condensate in the tank .",
    "there will be some slight change in the state of this pair , due to the @xmath2 atoms , and due to electrons already collected in the box from previous steps . such small effects can arise for example from lattice vibrations caused by collisions of these particles with the walls of the box ; such collisions will indirectly induce small vibrations of the chamber where the pair was disassociating .",
    "but we assume that the net change of the state of the newly created pair from all such effects is small , governed by a small parameter @xmath103 .",
    "we will have this situation if the box is large , and we study the evolution only upto a time when it is not so full of quanta that these quanta spill over and occupy the disassociation chamber ; this requirement is analogous to asking that we study the black hole evaporation process only for times where the size of the horizon remains in the semiclassical domain .      to summarize , with the model set up as above , we have captured most of the features of black hole evaporation in the case where we assume a traditional horizon .",
    "particle pairs are pulled out of our reservoir tank ; each new pair is pulled out in the same state and gives rise to an entangled pair upon disassociation into a radiated electron and an electron collected in the box .",
    "there are small corrections to this entangled state from atoms initially placed in the box , and also from electrons collecting in the box , but these effects are assumed small . in this situation",
    "the entanglement between the radiated quanta and the system left behind will keep rising .",
    "this monotonic rise is different from what we got for the case of burning paper , where the entropy behind to decrease after a point .",
    "of course in this laboratory model we can not keep on creating pairs indefinitely ; when the tank is empty the pair creation will stop . in the traditional picture of the black hole ,",
    "on the other hand , the pair creation will continue as long as the horizon has a semiclassical size .",
    "the goal of our laboratory model of condensed pairs is to just to illustrate the nature of the pair creation process , not to map the black hole to a laboratory situation .",
    "of course there is one feature of black hole evaporation that we can not capture in such a model : the situation at the endpoint of evaporation . in our model of disassociating electron pairs we can stop the evolution after some timestep @xmath4 , perhaps when all the pairs in the tank are exhausted . at this stage there is a large entanglement ( @xmath140 ) between the radiated quanta and the box , but this is not a contradiction in any way ; if there are many electrons in the box then we can certainly have a radiation state that is highly entangled with this box .",
    "the novel thing about black holes is the attractive nature of gravity , which can reduce the net energy of a system to a value arbitrarily below the rest energy of its constituents . in the box",
    "above we have the atoms representing the initial matter @xmath2 in the hole , and we have the electrons that represent the quanta @xmath62 that fall into the hole . in the laboratory model the energies of these two kinds of matter add up .",
    "but in the black hole the @xmath62 quanta have negative energy because of the gravitational attraction of the hole , and after enough @xmath62 quanta have collected , the net mass of @xmath2 and @xmath62 reduces down to planck scale .",
    "it is this latter fact which creates the information problem : either such small mass states ( remnants ) must possess an infinite degeneracy ( to allow for arbitrarily large entanglement ) or the hole disappears completely , leaving the radiation in a mixed state with nothing that it is ` mixed with ' .",
    "the above models of ` small corrections to hawking radiation ' ( section [ secthree ] ) and the model of burning paper above illustrate the essential power of the inequality proved in @xcite : the hawking evolution is stable against small corrections , in the sense that such small corrections can not remove the large entanglement between the radiation and the hole found at leading order .",
    "we see explicitly that the case of ` burning paper ' is essentially different ; for this latter situation we indeed reproduce the conventional expectation discussed by page @xcite .    in our numerical models we were able to pursue the evolution only for about @xmath110 timesteps .",
    "the number of states of the system rises exponentially , and limitations of computer memory and time do not allow us to go much further .",
    "it is likely that the large space of states can be handled by techniques like monte carlo , as in the work on lattice gauge theory , but we have not tried to do this since the issue to be understood here was the role of ` delicate correlations ' , and a computation using approximations would not be convincing in its conclusions . in principle there is no barrier to evolving through more timesteps if more computational power is available .",
    "the examples above illustrate the general theorem of @xcite that small corrections to hawking s computation can not solve the information paradox .",
    "we now turn to how the paradox is actually resolved in string theory .",
    "one finds that the corrections to the evolution of low energy modes at the horizon are _ not small _ ; in fact the entire structure of the hole at the horizon is radically different from the traditional black hole geometry @xcite .",
    "the details of the structure depend on the choice of microstate ( from among the @xmath141 $ ] states of the hole ) .",
    "such microstates are called ` fuzzballs ' , because the generic state of the hole is a very nontrivial quantum fuzz in the region where the horizon would have been , instead of the smooth vacuum of the traditional black hole geometry ( fig.[ftwop ] ) .",
    "changing the state of the hole at the horizon certainly resolves the information paradox ; if we no longer have the repeated ` pair creation from vacuum ' that we discussed in section [ ineq ] , then we evade the whole problem of monotonically growing entanglement between the radiation and the hole .",
    "in fact for simple fuzzballs the radiation has been computed explicitly , and seen to lead to no information problem .",
    "the fuzzball has no horizon , but it does have an ergoregion , and radiation emerges by the process of ergoregion emission @xcite .",
    "this process also creates quanta in pairs , but the inner member of the pair does not fall into a horizon ; instead it resides in the ergoregion , where it affects the evolution of later quanta , and in fact can emerge itself ( in general after severe interactions ) at a later time .",
    "this is exactly the behavior of radiation from ` burning paper ' , discussed in section [ burn ] .",
    "one finds that the _ rate _ of radiation agrees exactly with what would be expected for hawking radiation from this microstate@xcite ; this agreement is based on computing the radiation process in the cft where the radiation can be computed for any microstate .",
    "but while the rate is the same as that for the hawking process , the mechanism of emission is different , and does not lead to the information problem .",
    "thus we resolve the information paradox , but we can now wonder about the ` infall problem ' . in @xcite",
    "the difference between these two issues was discussed in detail , and it was noted that they are in a sense _ opposite _ problems .",
    "the information paradox asks about the detailed state of the low energy quanta ( @xmath142 ) emitted by the hole , and how _ different _ states of the hole can give rise to _ different _ states of the radiation .",
    "the ` infall problem ' asks if there is an effective description in which these various microstates behave in the _ same _ way for the purpose of describing the infall of heavy ( @xmath10 ) objets over short times ( times of order the crossing scale rather than the hawking evaporation scale ) .",
    "in particular we can ask if this effective coarse grained dynamics somehow involves the traditional black hole geometry which has a smooth horizon .",
    "some initial comments about the infall problem in the fuzzball picture were given in @xcite ; here we consider this issue in more detail .",
    "let us begin by asking what fuzzballs suggest about the behavior of rindler space , which shares many features with black holes .",
    "fig.[fn5](a ) depicts minkowski space , with its four rindler quadrants : r ( right ) , l ( left ) , f ( future ) , p ( past ) .",
    "the minkowski space metric is ds^2=-dt^2+dx^2 under a coordinate change t = rt ,  x = rt we get the metric in the right quadrant ds^2=-r^2 dt^2+dr^2 [ ssone ] in fig.[fn5](b ) we depict the extended schwarzschild geometry of the black hole .",
    "the region near the center of the diagram ( where the two horizons intersect ) looks just like the diagram of minkowski space broken into its rindler quadrants .",
    "the r ( right ) region is now the exterior of the black hole , and the analog of ( [ ssone ] ) is the metric ds^2=-(1 - 2mr)dt^2+dr^21 - 2mr+r^2d_2 ^ 2 [ sstwo ] for @xmath143 , we write t = t4 m ,   r=2 and we get from ( [ sstwo ] ) ds^2- r^2 d t^2 + d r^2 + ( 2m)^2 d_2 ^ 2 giving rindler space ( [ ssone ] ) times a sphere .",
    "note that if we go to the euclidean section in the rindler metric ( [ ssone ] ) ds^2=r^2d^2+dr^2 then regularity at @xmath18 would need the compactification ~+2so that we get the temperature @xmath144 in the rindler coordinate frame @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "at any radius @xmath146 , we can go to the local orthonormal frame where we measure time as ds^2d(r_0)^2d^2 the temperature measured in time @xmath147 is @xmath148 , so we see that this temperature diverges as we go towards the horizon @xmath149 .",
    "this is all a standard discussion of rindler space , but we now make a series of observations that relate the observations above to fuzzball solutions :    \\(i ) consider the rindler metric ( [ ssone ] ) .",
    "suppose the spacetime carries a scalar field @xmath150 .",
    "then we will see a thermal bath of quanta of @xmath150 with temperature @xmath148 at radius @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) suppose this scalar field is an interacting one , with lagrangian @xmath151 .",
    "then the @xmath150 quanta in this thermal bath will be interacting among themselves with the quartic interaction @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) one field that is always present in any theory of spacetime is the gravitational field , whose fluctuations we will term @xmath153 . thus we always expect a thermal bath of gravitons in the rindler frame .",
    "\\(iv ) following ( ii ) above , this thermal bath should consist of _ interacting _ gravitons ,",
    "so in the rindler frame we should see fully non - linear gravity near the horizon .",
    "this suggests that the rindler problem needs to include the physics of curved spacetime to be consistently defined .",
    "since we are looking at a quantum problem , we really mean here solutions of the quantum gravity theory ( which would be string theory in what follows ) .",
    "\\(v ) we can now wonder what are the nonlinear gravity solutions that should appear near the horizon . in fig.[fn11](b )",
    "we depict the full penrose diagram of the schwarzschild metric ( [ sstwo ] ) , and also what we find in the fuzzball picture : the schwarzschild like metric of the right ( r ) region is severely modified near the horizon and ends in a ` quantum fuzz ' . by analogy , it appears natural to conjecture that a similar situation would hold for rindler space , and we depict this in fig.[fn11](a ) : the geometry of the right rindler region ( r ) ends in a quantum fuzz ; this quantum state is supposed to describe the interacting gravitational field of ( iv ) above .",
    "the black hole has a finite area horizon and thus a finite number of degrees of freedom , while the rindler solutions should to be thought of as fuzzball solutions with some kind of @xmath154 limit in mind .",
    "thus we are conjecturing that the rindler observer sees gravity solutions that _ end without horizon _ at the boundary of the right rindler region .",
    "this may seem odd , since in minkowski coordinates the spacetime continues past a smooth horizon into the other rindler quadrants .",
    "but note that the minkowski spacetime was flat , while the steps ( i)-(v ) in the above argument have force us to think of rindler space as a very nontrivial quantum gravitational solution near the horizon .",
    "we will now discuss how these two different perspectives can be reconciled .",
    "there have been many observations relating the extended penrose diagram of the black hole to the idea of entangled systems .",
    "we recall these ideas briefly , and then discuss how one might understand the role of fuzzball solutions in the context of these ideas .",
    "this discussion will lead us to a version of ` complementarity ' for the black hole .",
    "\\(a ) israel @xcite noted that the left and right sides of the eternal black hole penrose diagram ( fig.[fn5](b ) ) can be regarded as the two copies of a system that arise in the thermo - field - dynamics ( tfd ) formalism @xcite .",
    "thus the overall state of the system would be an entangled state of the fields on the left and right sides , and either side alone would have to be described by a density matrix where the other side was traced over .",
    "\\(b ) maldacena @xcite observed that the dual to the eternal black hole ( in @xmath155 ) should be a pair of cft s , with one copy of the cft corresponding to each asymptotic infinity of the full penrose diagram .",
    "the states of these two cfts are entangled , in accordance with the entanglement of the bulk in ( a ) above .",
    "\\(c ) van raamsdonk used the above notions to taken the issue of entanglement further @xcite .",
    "he observes that states in the individual cfts would correspond to a gravity solution with only one asymptotic infinity , and it is the entanglement over two sets of such gravity solutions that must generate the ` bridge ' that links the two sides of the penrose diagram of fig.[fn5](b ) .",
    "we depict this general notion in fig.[fn6 ] .",
    "summing over the pair of gravity solutions on the lhs ( with appropriate weights ) gives an entangled state of gravity which can be alternatively represented by a manifold which has a ` bridge ' linking the two sides .",
    "\\(d ) at this point we need to consider the nature of the states involved in each factor of the sum in ( c ) . in the traditional picture of the black hole",
    "we would have two kinds of states : states like @xmath155 plus a few quanta ( which have no horizon ) , and states that have a black hole ( these do have a horizon ) .",
    "the latter states would be more numerous ( because of the high entropy of the hole ) . for the black hole states we would need to draw something different from the geometries on the lhs of fig.[fn6 ] to take into account that each of the left and right factors on the lhs itself possesses a horizon .",
    "but in the fuzzball picture we do not have two different classes of states ; all states are horizon - free and simply differ from each other in their degree of ` complexity ' .",
    "thus we should write the sum as in fig.[fn7 ] : the energy weighted sum over all microstates gives the eternal hole geometry which connects the two disconnected factors .. here we are simply noting that if the states were split into ` thermal @xmath155 states ' and ` black hole states ' ( with horizons ) then it is not clear what such a relation would mean . ]        taking the limit of @xmath154 we should recover an analogous statement for rindler space : a weighted sum over rindler wedges ` ending without horizon ' should give minkowski spacetime ( fig.[fn12 ] ) .     to rindler space .",
    "a ( weighted ) sum over products of gravitational solutions ( residing in only one quadrant each and having a very quantum gravitational region near the horizon ) should give smooth minkowski spacetime . ]",
    "\\(e ) with this extended geometry we can pass smoothly through the horizon . in the simpler rindler case ,",
    "the region f is described by field modes that are left moving in the r sector and right moving in the l sector .",
    "( these modes simply extend across their respective horizons to give a compete basis in the f region . ) similarly , in the eternal black hole geometry the modes inside the future horizon are given by continuing appropriate modes from the r and l regions .",
    "\\(f ) thus a single fuzzball does not have a horizon that we can continue through to reach the ` interior ' of the black hole .",
    "but the ensemble sum over fuzzballs can be given such an extension .",
    "now consider the conjecture on the infall problem made in @xcite .",
    "it was noted that infalling objects whose physics should not be affected materially by hawking radiation have energies @xmath10 . for these high energies we can replace correlation functions in a given fuzzball by the corresponding correlation function in the ensemble over fuzzballs ( assuming that the fuzzball is a generic one ) .",
    "since this ensemble sum is described by a geometry which can be continued across the horizon , we obtain an effective description for infalling observers where nothing happens at the horizon .",
    "let us make this proposal more explicit . in any statistical ensemble , there exist ` generic ' observables @xmath156 , whose correlation functions in a _",
    "generic _ microstate are equal , to a good approximation , to the _ ensemble average _ over microstates : |o_1o_2|_i e^-e_i _",
    "i|o_1o_2|_i[ppone ] the rhs can be written as _",
    "i e^-e_i _ i|o_1o_2|_i= tr  ( _ o_1o_2 ) where @xmath157 .",
    "let @xmath158 in ( [ ppone ] ) be a generic fuzzball state ; this state has no horizon .",
    "the correlator can be approximated by one in the thermal density matrix , which , as we have argued following @xcite , is given by the eternal black hole spacetime .",
    "it is only in this sense that we recover a geometry with a horizon : the indiviual fuzzball has no horizon , while the eternal black hole spacetime does .",
    "but note that after averaging we lose all information about the initial microstate @xmath158 .",
    "thus we can not hope to recover the details of @xmath158 from the hawking radiation observed in the ensemble average . and",
    "indeed , the eternal black hole diagram does not have the spacetime structure to radiate any information .",
    "in fact there is no unique choice of matter vacuum that goes along with its geometry ; we can choose the vacuum so that it radiates energy , absorbs energy , or does neither .",
    "the only question that remains is : what operators @xmath156 are ` generic ' in the sense that they satisfy ( [ ppone ] ) .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that these will be operators that are natural for measurements in the frame of a lab falling from infinity to the surface of the fuzzball : the high relative velocity between the lab and the fuzzball makes these operators ` high impact ' in the sense that they will cause the fuzzball to jump from one state to a linear combination of states in a _ band _ around the initial energy of the fuzzball .",
    "this band has a large number of states because of the high entropy of the black hole , and the smearing over this band makes the correlators insensitive to the precise choice on initial microstate @xmath158 in ( [ ppone ] ) .",
    "\\(g ) modes of the hawking radiation itself are low energy ( @xmath142 ) , and for these we can not make the approximation ( [ ppone ] ) of using a thermal ensemble .",
    "( in @xcite the following analogy was used .",
    "the evolution of hawking quanta is like the brownian motion of a single atom in a gas , sensitively dependent on the detailed positions of the gas molocules , while @xmath10 observers are like heavy objects moving through the gas , described by an overall viscosity that is computable in an ensemble average . )",
    "thus the fuzzball structure of microstates provides the order unity correction to the evolution of hawking quanta ( which is necessary to resolve the information paradox ) , and the ensemble average description appropriate to infalling observes gets modeled by an effective geometry that continues smoothly through a horizon .",
    "let us see why a relation of the kind in fig.[fn6 ] might be reasonable .",
    "consider a euclidean cft on a 2-d manifold .",
    "start with this cft on two spheres as on the lhs of fig.[fn8 ] . on each sphere , cut out a hole given by @xmath159 , in some coordinate chart @xmath160 .",
    "let @xmath161 be the state at the edge of each hole .",
    "consider the tensor product theory of the two spheres , and sum over all states @xmath161 with a weightage factor @xmath162 ( here @xmath163 are holomorphic and antiholomorphic weights of the state , and @xmath164 is a modular parameter ) .",
    "this process generates a handle connecting the two spheres , so that at least in this case we may replace the complicated sum over states by a smooth manifold .",
    "note that on each individual sphere , in any one state @xmath161 , we would not see the smooth and circularly symmetric handle if we try to pass through the circle @xmath165 to smaller values of @xmath166 .",
    "suppose we took the cft to be that of 2-d gravity ( described , say , by dynamical triangulations ) . then continuing the state inside @xmath165 would give in general a complicated geometry for each @xmath161 .",
    "this complication can be manifested in suitable correlation functions by making one or more points in the correlator approach the circle @xmath165 .",
    "we now have the situation in fig.[fn9 ] , where a weighted sum over complicated geometries reproduces the smooth geometry which has a handle connecting the two sides .",
    "the individual states on any sphere are akin to fuzzball states , and the weighted sum is akin to the eternal black hole diagram . in short ,",
    "the relation of fig.[fn9 ] suggests that we should think of ` fuzzball microstates ' as a ` complete set ' of gravitational states that we can use in sums of the form @xmath167 for generating ` handles ' on spacetime .",
    "is finite ; it would be good to understand this better . ]     in fig.[fn8 ] give a complicated structure when continued inside @xmath165 .",
    "thus an entangled sum over pairs of complicated geometric states generates the smooth manifold on the rhs . ]",
    "t hooft postulated the notion of black hole complementarity @xcite , and susskind and others developed this notion further @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is that the black hole physics has two different descriptions .",
    "for an observer outside the horizon , we should use a description where there is no region interior to the horizon : objects fall to the horizon , with this infall slowing down because of the diverging redshift . for this outside observer , the infalling object gets destroyed at the horizon and its information should be encoded in the emerging hawking radiation . for an infalling observer",
    ", on the other hand , nothing special happens at the horizon , and he carries his information with him into the region behind the horizon .",
    "the existence of two descriptions is supposed to be consistent because of the kinematical structure of the black hole spacetime : the observer falling into the hole can not send signals out , and lives for only a short time before hitting the singularity .",
    "these two descriptions of the hole are ` complementary ' in the sense that any attempt to describe the physics seen by the outside observer and the infalling observer at the same time would amount to ` double counting ' .",
    "while complementarity is an appealing idea , and may bypass the information problem , it runs into an immediate difficulty .",
    "consider the full penrose diagram of the hole foliated by the nice slices depicted in fig.[fthree ] ( and in more detail in fig.[ftwo ] ) .",
    "this foliation captures the infalling shell which made the hole , as well as all the @xmath168 quanta that are emitted in the hawking radiation process .",
    "since the geometry is regular everywhere , there is no reason why physics on one part of these slices should give a complementary description of the physics on other part of the slice ; the entire slice would appear to be the correct cauchy surface .",
    "there seems to be no way to build in complementarity in the black hole geometry while keeping physics unchanged in all other examples of evolution in gently curved spacetime .",
    "but with the recognition that black hole microstates are fuzzballs ( and therefore not approximated by the penrose diagram of fig.[fthree ] ) we can take another look at the issue .",
    "for the outside observer , we consider just one fuzzball state ( depicted in fig.[ftwop ] ) , and indeed in this case physics ` ends ' in the vicinity of where the traditional horizon would have been .",
    "for the infalling observer , we have to ask what we mean by his ` observations ' .",
    "are these expectation values in one fuzzball state or in the ensemble average ?",
    "if we take the latter , then as discussed above we can continue his dynamics past the horizon into an extended spacetime , and in particular find the ` interior ' of the hole . thus in this approach the interior of the hole arises as an ensemble averaged description of the collective modes of fuzzballs .",
    "it would be interesting to relate this to other approaches where the microstates are averaged to obtain an effective geometry @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to recall the idea of how one may see a ` brick wall ' just outside the horizon @xcite .",
    "the idea may be summarized as follows .",
    "the standard hawking radiation process produces radiation in a complicated entangled state of @xmath169 pairs . but suppose we choose a particular state of the radiated @xmath104 quanta .",
    "this particular state if quite different from the full entangled state , and if we follow the @xmath170 quanta back towards the horizon in this state then they will not meet up with the appropriate @xmath62 quanta to create the vacuum state that hawking used .",
    "in fact due to the large blueshift in this backwards evolution , this non - vacuum state will have a very large stress - energy near the horizon , and we can imagine that the backreaction of this energy generates a geometry completely different from the traditional hole with horizon .",
    "an infalling object could thus scatter off the ` brick wall ' which appears where the horizon would have been , and we get a self - consistent picture where infalling matter scatters to the outgoing radiation by a unitary s - matrix .",
    "the problem with this approach is of course that there is no reason to take a particular ` out ' state of the @xmath170 quanta if we want to find the effect on infalling matter .",
    "the evolution of the entire state is given by a schrodinger equation on a complete caucy surface ( in the ` nice slicing ' ) , and individual ` in - out ' amplitudes give only part of the information in the wavefunctional . by the time we sum over all the relevant ` in - out ' amplitudes , we should recover an evolution ( in the traditional general relativity setting ) where the infalling object sees smooth infall through the horizon .",
    "but with our fuzzball construction of string microstates the situation is different .",
    "individual fuzzballs can be seen as providing a ` brick wall ' through which we can not pass . but",
    "this time it is not the choice of ` in - out ' amplitudes that has made the difference ; rather it is the structure of the microstate wavefunctional itself .    to summarize , many of the ideas that have been postulated to resolve the information puzzle had deep and interesting aspects to them .",
    "the stumbling block in each case was that there was nothing really at the horizon , and therefore one had to appeal to gauge artifacts ( high temperatures in the schwarzschild frame ) or foundational issues in quantum mechanics ( measuring ` in - in ' vs ` in - out ' amplitudes ) to generate nontrivial effects at the horizon .",
    "but in string theory we get real degrees of freedom at the horizon @xcite , and then we can see that many aspects of these old ideas come to life by a new route . suggests that one is counting fuzzball states of the gravitational theory . ]",
    "the black hole information puzzle has been surrounded by several interrelated confusions .",
    "first , one has to note the distinction between the information paradox and the ` infall problem ' . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that these are in a sense _ opposite _ problems ; the former requires us to find some way of getting _ different _ radiation states from different microstates , while the latter asks if the infall of heavy ( @xmath10 ) objects can look essentially the _ same _ in generic microstates .",
    "second , we have issue of small corrections . here the confusion is caused by the behavior of burning paper ( studied in detail in @xcite , for example ) , where the information in the paper is encoded in the radiation but very hard to decipher .",
    "this may lead to a feeling that small quantum gravity effects may have delicately encoded the black hole s information in the hawking radiation , and the leading order hawking computation was too crude to notice this detail . as against this",
    "is the fact there no one had produced a toy model of small corrections which _ would _ encode the information in the radiation .",
    "this issue is clarified with the inequality proved in @xcite , where it was shown that small corrections _ can not _ encode the information and to a nonentangled state for the radiation  if the corrections are bounded by @xmath79 then the fractional decrease of entanglement due to the corrections is bounded by @xmath171 .",
    "this inequality was illustrated in @xcite by a simple model of small corrections which could be solved analytically . in the present paper",
    "we have used numerical computations , which allowed us to make arbitrarily complicated models of small corrections .",
    "the monotonic growth of entanglement entropy during the evolution again illustrated the general inequality .",
    "a model of ` burning paper ' showed how the radiation process is unitary in this case , and fundamentally different from the black hole radiation process .",
    "the inequality of @xcite has some immediate consequences .",
    "it requires that if information is to come out in hawking radiation then there must be _ order unity _",
    "corrections to the evolution of low energy modes at the horizon .",
    "the fuzzball construction shows that in string theory microstates are indeed very different from the traditional hole at the horizon , and for simple fuzzballs the radiation has can be seen explicitly as a unitary process . in theories",
    "that do not have the degrees of freedom to give fuzzballs ( canonically quantized gravity may be one of them ) we would get information loss or remnants .",
    "another corollary of the inequality is that we can not simply use the idea of ads / cft duality to argue away the information paradox : as argued in @xcite , if the ads - schwarzschild black hole geometry is attained in the theory as an approximate solution , then we would be forced to information loss / remnants . as another consequence of the inequality",
    "we note that several scenarios about the information problem in the literature should probably be seen as remnant scenarios . hawking",
    "@xcite suggested that including alternate geometries in the euclidean path integral would give a small correction to the evolution process , and restore unitarity .",
    "but since these exponentially small corrections can not remove entanglement from the hawking radiation , the unitarity can be restored in any such scenario only by slow leakage from a remnant .",
    "marolf @xcite has argued that information is present at infinity at all times since the energy spectrum of a finite system is discrete ; if this energy is measurable from infinity it would identify the state of the black hole .",
    "but at this point we have to ask if the system has fuzzballs or a traditional hole ; if the latter , then the information captured at infinity would be describing the state of a remnant since the radiation would have escaped without information .",
    "a third puzzle has been the fact that the black hole horizon appears large and semiclassical , so it looks paradoxical that the structure here would be modified radically to a fuzzball structure which has no such horizon . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that the classical / quantum separation of scales in the black hole is fundamentally altered by the enormously large entropy of the black hole : the classical action for tunneling between two fuzzball microstates is of the same order as the measure of the space of fuzzball states .",
    "a crude estimate @xcite shows that the wavefunction of a collapsing shell would spread over a linear combination of fuzzball states in a time much shorter than the hawking evaporation time .",
    "finally , there is the issue of whether the traditional black hole geometry has any role to play at all in the physics of black holes . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that if we euclidize time and perform a 1-loop path integral , then we are doing a sum over all fuzzball solutions . while each fuzzball has no symmetry , the saddle point of such a path integral ,",
    "if it exists , would be expected to be the usual spherically symmetric ` cigar ' geometry of the euclidean black hole .",
    "what about the lorentzian black hole solution ?",
    "this issue brings us back to the difference between the information paradox and the ` infall problem ' . by what was noted above about the ` small corrections ' issue",
    ", the information puzzle can only be solved by an explicit construction of fuzzballs in the theory ( which would by definition modify by order unity the evolution of low energy ( @xmath142 ) quanta at the horizon . ) but for the infall of high energy quanta ( @xmath10 ) we may replace a generic fuzzball by its ensemble average . at this point we used ideas in the literature ( discussed in @xcite , for example ) to note that the ensemble sum over fuzzballs may be replaced by the traditional extended black hole geometry ( which does have horizons ) .",
    "what would be wrong would be to use this geometry with smooth horizon to compute the emission of low energy hawking radiation ; such a computation ( even including small corrections ) will necessarily give information loss / remnants .",
    "instead we must recognize that individual microstates have the fuzzball structure depicted in fig.[ftwop ] which has a complicated quantum gravitational region instead of a smooth horizon .",
    "for a very crude analogy , consider the ` method of images ' used in electrostatics to study the field of a point charge @xmath172 placed over a grounded conducting plane ( fig.[fn10](a ) ) .",
    "we can replace the conductor by an image charge @xmath173 placed at the mirror image point ( fig.[fn10](b ) ) .",
    "a test charge @xmath174 feels _ almost _ the same field in the region above the plane in both cases ; the differences come only very close to the conductor where microscopic differences in the metal lattice determines the precise locations of electrons on the surface .",
    "the region below the conducing surface is of course very different in the two cases ; the test charge @xmath174 can continue smoothly past the plane boundary in fig.[fn10](b ) , but in this effective replacement of the conductor we have also lost the detailed information about the location of the electrons .",
    "eastablishes a field over a grounded conducting plane , and a test charge @xmath174 moves in this field ( b ) the field above the plane is reproduced by replacing the plane by an image charge @xmath173 .",
    "the detailed information about the location of electrons in the conductor is lost in this replacement . ]",

    "<S> it is sometimes believed that small quantum gravity effects can encode information as ` delicate correlations ' in hawking radiation , thus saving unitarity while maintaining a semiclassical horizon . </S>",
    "<S> a recently derived inequality showed that this belief is incorrect : one must have order unity corrections to low energy evolution at the horizon ( i.e. fuzzballs ) to remove entanglement between radiation and the hole . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we take several models of ` small corrections ' and compute the entanglement entropy numerically ; in each case this entanglement is seen to monotonically grow , in agreement with the general inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct a model of ` burning paper ' , where the entanglement is found to rise and then return to zero , in agreement with the general arguments of page . </S>",
    "<S> we then note that the fuzzball structure of string microstates offers a version of ` complementarity ' . </S>",
    "<S> low energy evolution is modified by order unity , resolving the information problem , while for high energy infalling modes ( @xmath0 ) we may be able to replace correlators by their ensemble averaged values . </S>",
    "<S> israel ( and others ) have suggested that this ensemble sum can be represented in the thermo - field - dynamics language as an entangled sum over two copies of the system , giving the two sides of the extended black hole diagram . thus high energy correlators in a microstate may be approximated by correlators in a spacetime with horizons , with the ensemble sum over microstates acting like the ` sewing ' prescription of conformal field theory .    </S>",
