    "planetary atmospheres and oceans are strongly turbulent media . however , highly ordered coherent structures arise in a process of self - organization , and dominate the dynamics on slow temporal and large spatial scales . + the spontaneous appearance of coherent structures is a characteristic of two - dimensional fluid flows .",
    "the basic underlying structure of these flows is linked to the existence of two quadratic , positive definite invariants , energy and enstrophy . in spectra of two - dimensional turbulence one",
    "observes two different cascades associated with these conserved quantities ; a direct enstrophy cascade towards small spatial scales , and an indirect energy cascade towards larger spatial scales .",
    "it is the latter which gives rise to vortex merging leading to larger and larger vortices . in this letter",
    "we view the problem as one of weakly nonlinear hydrodynamic stability rather than turbulence phenomenology .",
    "+ most vortices are monopolar , but dipole and even tripole vortices can also appear spontaneously .",
    "monopole vortices are mainly created by shear flow instabilities whereas dipole vortices typically appear when some additional forcing is applied to the flow .",
    "+ the richness and complexity of two - dimensional flows and the simultaneous presence of motion on very different temporal and spatial scales makes a direct analysis of the basic equations of motion very difficult .",
    "the presence of rotation reinforces the two - dimensional character in accordance with the taylor - proudman theorem , but rotation can also introduce baroclinic instability .",
    "the latter is a three - dimensional feature and , thus supports a direct energy cascade towards small scales .",
    "hence , the dynamics is determined by competing two - dimensional and three - dimensional processes @xcite . to study vortices in geophysical fluid dynamics",
    "the primitive equations are further reduced by approximations which allow to focus on temporal and spatial length scales of vortices @xcite .",
    "if additionally baroclinic processes are excluded a further simplification can be made .",
    "the dynamically important variable is the so called potential vorticity @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting quasigeostrophic barotropic vorticity equation @xmath1 describes large scale motion on a slow time scale . here",
    "@xmath2 is the stream function , @xmath3 describes the ambient rotation of the planet and @xmath4 is the fluid depth .",
    "this equation was first derived by charney @xcite , and then independently by obukhov @xcite . in the context of low - frequency drift waves in magnetized plasmas equation ( [ charney ] ) is known as the hasegawa - mima equation @xcite .",
    "this equation has been the mathematical starting point for much of the research done on coherent structures and vortices .",
    "it supports so called modons which are localized soliton - like coherent solutions .",
    "exact modon solutions were obtained by larichev & reznik @xcite for a stationary double - vortex solution which is antisymmetric in longitude .",
    "extensions to more general solutions have been made @xcite , and the spherical geometry of planets has been incorporated @xcite .",
    "however , modons have the drawback that the potential vorticity is not a smooth function of the stream function , but may be multivalued .",
    "therefore interest has grown in low - dimensional models , although a rigorous proof of existence of a low - dimensional attractor in quasigeostrophic systems is still an unsolved problem . strictly speaking",
    ", one can only define a `` slowest invariant manifold '' @xcite , since the small - scale events , i.e. the high - frequency and high - wavenumber processes , enlarge the hausdorff dimension for the attractor without any convergence @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in order to understand better the particular mechanisms involved in the formation and dynamics of vortices in geophysical fluid dynamics , it is useful to perform asymptotic techniques to derive reduced amplitude equations of the basic quasigeostrophic equations in a multiple scale analysis and study the derived model evolution - equations .",
    "the basic idea is that coherent vortices may be identified with solitary wave solutions of generic nonlinear dispersive wave equations .",
    "+ most research has been done in the frame work of the korteweg - de vries equation or in the framework of the boussinesq equation @xcite . while these models were helpful in describing and identifying mechanisms for atmospheric blocking , cyclogenesis , meandering of oceanic streams and the persistence of the great red spot in the jovian atmosphere , they are all one - dimensional models with their obvious limitations .",
    "+ in this letter we will extend weakly nonlinear , long wave multiple scale analysis to two dimensions and derive the zakharov - kuznetsov equation @xmath5 the zakharov - kuznetsov ( zk ) equation @xcite is one of two well - studied canonical two - dimensional extensions of the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite ; the other being the kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) equation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the kp - equation , the zk - equation has so far never been derived in a geophysical fluid dynamics context . for a derivation of the kp equations for internal waves ,",
    "see @xcite . whereas the kp - equation is valid in isotropic situations , the zk - equation is valid in anisotropic settings which is exactly the case for rotating fluids where the differential longitudinal dependence of the rotation rate causes anisotropy between the meridional and the longitudinal directions . moreover , in contrast to the kp - equation the zk - equation supports stable lump solitary waves .",
    "this makes the zk - equation a very attractive model equation for the study of vortices in geophsyical flows .",
    "+ the letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we set up the barotropic vorticity equation and the mean flow configurations under consideration . in the beginning of section 3",
    "we will give a simple heuristic scaling argument based on the linearized barotropic vorticity equation to motivate why the zk - equation is the generic two - dimensional nonlinear wave equation .",
    "in the remainder of section 3 we will derive the zk - equation in an asymptotic multiple scale analysis .",
    "section 4 concludes the letter with a discussion and an outlook on further research .",
    "we shall use a non - dimensional coordinate system , based on a typical horizontal length scale @xmath6 , a typical vertical scale @xmath7 , and typical coriolis parameter @xmath8 .",
    "a typical velocity @xmath9 is taken to be the maximum of the mean current velocity and the time scale is given by @xmath10 .",
    "if we separate the meridional meanflow @xmath11 from the perturbation pressure fields @xmath12 and use the boussinesq approximation , we obtain the following equation for the non - dimensional perturbation pressure field @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 with froude number @xmath15 and the jacobian defined by @xmath16 . we investigate a channel flow with a storm track superimposed on a constant meanflow @xmath17 confined at @xmath18 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the storm tracks may have a critical layer where @xmath19 .",
    "important is , as we will see , the non - vanishing slope at at least one boundary of the localized storm track .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath20 at @xmath21 , and we require that the jet forms a transport barrier to the flow .",
    "before we consider the weakly nonlinear , long wave approximation , we motivate our approach by looking at the linearization of equation ( [ qgp ] ) which yields @xmath22 in terms of @xmath23 we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath24 provided that the meanflow @xmath25 is constant .",
    "if we focus on dynamics on the spatial and temporal time scales @xmath26 , i.e. small @xmath27 , and @xmath28 this is suggestive of the coupled zakharov - kuznetsov equation @xmath29 the reason why we expect an equation of the zakharov - kuznetsov type instead of the usual kadomtsev - petviashvilli type mostly encountered in fluid systems is the anisotropic character of ( [ qgp ] ) caused by the @xmath30-effect .",
    "we consider weakly nonlinear waves riding on a background meanflow .",
    "the meanflow consists of a constant part @xmath17 and a strong but narrow jetstream ( see fig .",
    "the narrow storm track is located on a short meridional scale @xmath31 . in the outer region the problem ( [ qgp ] ) can be reduced to the linear problem ( [ lin1 ] ) with constant meanflow @xmath17 . in the interior",
    "the structure of the storm track does not allow for sinusoidal wave solutions but instead we will derive a nonlinear wave equation . in order for the nonlinear wave equation which is valid only in the inner region where the storm tracks are nonuniform",
    ", the inner solution has to be matched to the outer sinusoidal solution .      in the outer region where the meanflow is uniform and constant , ( [ qgp ] ) reduces to the simple linear equation ( [ lin1 ] ) for the streamfunction with constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "+ there the solution of the streamfunction can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the meridional wave number and is determined by the dispersion relation of the linearized model ( [ lin1 ] ) .      in the interior of the storm track on the small scale @xmath31 ,",
    "the meanflow is not constant .",
    "we shall study weakly nonlinear long waves .",
    "we introduce the following scales , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a small parameter , the inverse of which measures the large scales of the disturbance .",
    "next , we rescale the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the scaling of the froude numbers implies that our model is valid for situations where the internal rossby radius of deformation is of the order of the long horizontal scale .",
    "further , the scaling of @xmath30 implies that @xmath38 at the lowest order .",
    "the boundary conditions we use are @xmath39 at @xmath21 and @xmath40 at @xmath18 which simply states that there is no transport of fluid across the jet - stream .",
    "+ substituting this scaling into equation ( [ qgp ] ) yields , @xmath41 counting the orders of @xmath35 we obtain to the lowest order , @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we look for an amplitude equation , ie we want to write @xmath45 and seek an evolution equation for the slowly varying amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "we easily find @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant of integration .",
    "if we allow for zero meanflow within the narrow jet region we need to impose @xmath49 .",
    "we summarize the solution of equation ( [ ord_0 ] ) @xmath50 the meridional structure on the small scale @xmath31 of @xmath2 is entirely determined by the mean currents at the leading order .",
    "+ at the next order , @xmath51 , we obtain a linear inhomogeneous equation for @xmath52 , @xmath53 which can be written , using ( [ varphi0 ] ) , as @xmath54 this equation is again solved by the method of variation of parameters and we obtain @xmath55 with @xmath56 we note that the higher order term @xmath52 is slaved to the @xmath57 term and the dynamics of the corresponding amplitude equation which will be derived shortly . for the same reasons as above we set @xmath58 and obtain @xmath59 the @xmath60 terms give us an evolution equation for the amplitude @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 which , using ( [ psi0 ] ) , can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 to assure boundedness of the solutions of ( [ 116 ] ) we have to require a solvability condition in form of a fredholm alternative .",
    "+ the homogeneous adjoint problem to equation ( [ 116 ] ) may be written as @xmath65 with @xmath66 where we have used the boundary conditions @xmath67 at @xmath18 . the adjoint eigenvalue problem ( [ adjoint ] )",
    "has one trivial constant kernel mode @xmath68 and one nontrivial , namely @xmath69 the nontrivial kernel mode @xmath70 has to be discarded because it does not satisfy the boundary condition . to see this note that the fredholm alternative for the elliptic operator [ lop ] together with the boundary condition @xmath67 is equivalent to one for the operator @xmath71-u_y\\partial_y\\psi - u_{yy}\\partial_y\\psi$ ] with the boundary condition @xmath72 at @xmath18 .",
    "also note that a non - zero kernel mode @xmath73 is only consistent with the boundary conditions if @xmath74 .",
    "the solvability condition is thus given by the trivial constant kernel mode @xmath75 on substituting the expressions ( [ psi0 ] ) with @xmath76 and ( [ gn ] ) we obtain the desired amplitude equation for @xmath61 , @xmath77 where @xmath78_{-l}^l \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ i\\xi & = & \\int_{-l}^l u^2 \\ ; dy \\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ i\\zeta & = & \\left [ u^2(1-y - l ) \\right]_{-l}^l\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ i \\mu & = & - \\left [ u_{y}^2 \\right]_{-l}^l                 + \\left [ uu_{yy } \\right]_{-l}^l \\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ i\\delta & = & -\\int_{-l}^l \\beta u \\ ; dy \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that due to the last term of ( [ gn ] ) the zakharov - kuznetsov equation is inhomogeneous in the sense @xmath79 .",
    "it is pertinent to mention that a nonzero @xmath80 requires a nonzero mean flow at at least one of the boundaries of the storm track .",
    "the coefficients of the nonlinear terms @xmath81 require a non - vanishing slope at at least one boundary .",
    "the slope @xmath82 and also @xmath83 at the boundaries of the jet @xmath18 may be determined from a given meanflow configuration by averaging over a very short region , say @xmath84 , where a sudden change of the constant mean flow @xmath17 to the jet occurs .      at the lowest order the inner solution ( [ varphi0 ] ) with @xmath49 and the outer solution ( [ psi_out ] ) have to be matched .",
    "the outer solution has been derived on the large scale @xmath85 whereas the inner solution and its associated amplitude equation , the zakharov - kuznetsov equation ( [ zk11 ] ) , were derived on the short scale @xmath31 .",
    "henceforth we need to require that the asymptotic limit of the outer solutions for @xmath86 coincides with the asymptotic limit of the inner solution for @xmath87 .",
    "the limit of the inner solution is @xmath88 .",
    "the limit of the outer solution is @xmath89 .",
    "hence we find @xmath90 , which extends the dynamics of the zakharov - kuznetsov equations to the outer region .",
    "we have derived the nonlinear dispersive zakharov - kuznetsov equation from the quasigeostrophic barotropic vorticity equation .",
    "it is well known that the zk - equation , although it is not integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform , supports a family of steady - shape stable lump solitary waves , moving at an arbitrary velocity @xcite .",
    "these may help to describe two - dimensional coherent structures such as atmospheric blocking events , long lived eddies in the ocean or coherent structures in the jovian atmosphere such as the great red spot .",
    "the model is from an analytical point of view easier to treat than the full barotropic quasigeostrophic equation and its solutions do not exhibit multivalued potential vorticity - stream function relationships as modons do .",
    "+ geophysical flow on large scales is widely accepted to be conservative .",
    "this allows for hamiltonian descriptions of the flow on large scales .",
    "our model also exhibits a hamiltonian structure .",
    "note that the momentum @xmath91 and the hamiltonian with the hamiltonian density @xmath92 are conserved .",
    "+ we have assumed a meridional meanflow @xmath11 which consists of a constant part @xmath17 and a narrow localized storm track .",
    "note that the jet stream may also be a narrow interface between two regions of meanflow with opposite flow direction .",
    "such persistent shear layers exist between the zones and belts in the jovian atmosphere .",
    "+ analysis of the solutions of ( [ zk11 ] ) is planned .",
    "their stability has to be numerically tested within the zakharov - kuznetsov system .",
    "the zk - equation has been derived using asymptotic techniques and is as such an asymptotic limit to the barotropic quasigeostrophic vorticity equation .",
    "however , it is not clear that the same is true for the solutions .",
    "the solutions of the zakharov - kuznetsov equations do not necessarily have to be asymptotically close to the solutions of the full quasigeostrophic system .",
    "this is due to the lack of a centre manifold as discussed in the introduction . in further work",
    "we will test the approximation of the solution numerically by taking solutions of the zk - equation and testing their dynamics in the full quasigeostrophic system .",
