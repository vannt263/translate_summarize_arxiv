    "<S> triple - differential cross sections for neutrons from high - multiplicity la - la collisions at 250 and 400 mev per nucleon and nb - nb collisions at 400 mev per nucleon were measured at several polar angles as a function of the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction plane was determined by a transverse - velocity method with the capability of identifying charged - particles with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow of neutrons was extracted from the slope at mid - rapidity of the curve of the average in - plane momentum vs the center - of - mass rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the _ squeeze - out _ of the participant neutrons was observed in a direction normal to the reaction plane in the normalized momentum coordinates in the center - of - mass system . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results of the neutron squeeze - out were compared with buu calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the polar - angle dependence of the maximum azimuthal anisotropy ratio @xmath3 was found to be insensitive to the mass of the colliding nuclei and the beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the observed polar - angle dependence of the maximum azimuthal anisotropy ratio @xmath3 with buu calculations for _ free _ neutrons revealed that @xmath3 is insensitive also to the incompressibility modulus in the nuclear equation of state . </S>"
