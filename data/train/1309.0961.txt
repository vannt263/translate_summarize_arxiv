    "the notion of scale - free networks has been around for a while  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the _ preferential attachment _ ( pa ) algorithm for generating random scale - free graphs was a significant step in understanding the properties of scale - free networks , and the physical processes that create them @xcite .",
    "pa has spawned a good deal of subsequent algorithms and analysis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to highlight the straightforward fact that not all scale - free networks have the same properties , and that algorithms , like pa ( for example ) , do not capture the full richness of scale - free networks , nor do they necessarily display properties that may be termed typical of all scale - free networks .    to achieve our aim ,",
    "we first briefly recall in this introduction the principal processes that have been proposed to describe and generate scale - free networks , and indicate deficiencies of these processes when employed as models of typical scale - free networks .",
    "we then propose a _",
    "maximum entropy process _ that provides an unbiased sample of the set of all scale - free networks .",
    "a _ maximum entropy process _ provides a better representation of expected properties of scale - free networks , both in terms of richness and typicality .",
    "maximum entropy process _ also provides a unbiased standard against which other processes that generate scale - free networks can be compared . while a great deal of this maximum entropy process reduces to simple edge - switching , it is the application of this process to achieve maximum entropy realisations that is important .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we make a careful comparison of pa with our unbiased standard to illustrate how pa has a significant bias in the structural properties of the networks it generates .",
    "we demonstrate it has a _ hub - centric _ bias . in sec .",
    "[ sec : applications ] we use a surrogate data approach to examine a selection of real - world networks claimed to be scale - free , and analyze in what sense these networks are typical of scale - free networks and how they differ .      in this section",
    "we briefly review the notion of scale - free networks , and the principal models of the physical processes that generate scale - free networks .",
    "these models can be broadly divided into _ growth _ models and _ configuration _ models .",
    "scale - free networks are usually identified by the histogram of node degrees having a power - law tail .",
    "many naturally occurring networks have been identified as having a scale - free property : citation and collaboration networks  @xcite , airline networks  @xcite , protein - protein interaction  @xcite , metabolic pathways  @xcite , the world - wide web and internet  @xcite .",
    "to understand the formation of scale - free networks various models have been proposed to mimic the physical or conceptual processes that build and shape these networks .",
    "one of the first , proposed by barabsi and albert , is _ preferential attachment _",
    "@xcite , which is a restatement of the process described by de solla price  @xcite as a model of observed scale - free networks of citations  @xcite .",
    "preferential attachment is an _ unchanging _ , _ additive _ growth process , where nodes of a fixed degree are added to the network , with links preferentially attached to existing nodes depending on their degree ; usually proportional to the degree .",
    "although this was suggested as a model of the process that grows the world - wide web ( seen as hyperlinks between webpages ) , it was recognized that there is an additional _ aging _ process ( aol is replaced by facebook , yahoo looses popularity to google ) so that attachment preferences _ change _ as the network growth proceeds  @xcite .",
    "other processes can be introduced into a network growth model , such as _ shuffling _ parts of the network , and _ deletion _ of links and nodes  @xcite , such that these actions do not change the underlying scale - free property of the networks produced .",
    "moreover , scale - free networks can be produced by processes that are not growth processes .",
    "the most commonly considered of these are the so - called _",
    "configuration models_. configuration models proceed by choosing nodes to have prescribed degrees , then connecting these together to form a scale - free network  @xcite ; although care is needed to ensure the networks obtained satisfy other expected properties , such as , being simple ( no self - links or multiple edges between nodes ) and connected  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the problems with multplie edges and self - links @xcite , configuration models do not provide a well - founded sampling  in the sense of achieving maximum entropy realisations @xcite .      with so many different processes generating scale - free networks",
    ", the question arises : do they generate the same type of networks ?",
    "the simple answer is no .",
    "many differences in the scale - networks generated by different processes have been noted ; some particular differences are outlined in the following .",
    "consider a preferential attachment process that attaches nodes of degree  @xmath0 with the probability of linking a new node to a node of degree  @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constant called the _ initial attractiveness _",
    "the minimum degree  @xmath0 clearly effects the _ robustness _ of the networks generated , and it effects other properties too  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for the power - law tail has an exponent @xmath4 .",
    "this type of preferential attachment process restricts the power - law exponent to @xmath5 .",
    "many real - world networks exhibit @xmath6 .",
    "in such cases the graphs have been termed _ dense _  @xcite and generating such graphs has been seen as problematic .",
    "this led del genio and colleagues to conclude eponymously to the contrary .",
    "however , we recently provided an algorithm that easily find dense graph  the apparent paradox with the claim of @xcite is resolved when one observes that @xcite searches over the space of all networks while @xcite starts with the constraint of viable graphs of a fixed degree sequence . hence",
    ", both @xcite and @xcite proposed that these network growth models can be modified to shape networks and allow such power - laws .",
    "when other network statistics are considered ( such as diameter , node - degree assortativity , clustering coefficients ) , then the differences between scale - free networks found in the real - world and generated by different models becomes more apparent .",
    "for example , consider the node - degree assortativity of scale - free networks generated by preferential attachment .",
    "these networks have low assortativity , but many natural networks are found to have very high assortativity  @xcite .",
    "although these natural networks are not small - world ( although they are scale - free typically estimates of the exponent are much smaller than observed for most processes that generate scale - free networks : @xmath6 ) , it can be shown that other processes can generate scale - free networks with high node - degree assortativity  @xcite .",
    "newman  @xcite observed systematic biases in the assortativity of real - world scale - free networks : technological networks tended to be dis - assortative , social networks assortative .",
    "he also showed that networks generated by preferential attachment have a definite bias compared to real - world networks ; on the other hand , _ altruistic attachment _ does not  @xcite .",
    "other issues with the assortativity of preferential attachment networks  @xcite and scale - free networks more generally @xcite have been observed previously .",
    "it has been noted that growth models have systematic biases ( of network statistics ) relative to configuration models  @xcite .",
    "however , while configuration models can successfully alleviate that bias , it is not clear that they provide a sampling of the appropriate distribution . in particular , networks of growth models",
    "usually only attain the scale - free property asymptotically , and small networks display systematic biases  @xcite ; configuration models remove this particular growth - based bias , but it is not clear at what expense . for this reason we seek a maximum entropy realisation from the ensemble of viable graphs @xcite .      in this section",
    "we aim to define a process that generates scale - free networks in as pure form as possible , that is , without any of these biases .",
    "this process is a",
    "_ maximum entropy _ process , which can serve as a standard to which other processes can be compared to both recognize and understand the nature of their particular biases .",
    "as previously noted , _ scale - free _ is usually taken to mean that the node - degree histogram has a power - law tail .",
    "we need to make this definition more precise .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of connected simple graphs with @xmath8 nodes , and let @xmath9 , @xmath10 , be the degree histogram of  @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 is the number of nodes of degree  @xmath1 .",

    "preferential attachment is one example of such a process ; a network is grown by random preferential attachment until a graph with @xmath8 nodes is obtained .",
    "this process implicitly defines the probability mass function for @xmath11 , which depends on  @xmath0 and on how the seed network is chosen .",
    "other growth models ( with link ageing , initial attractiveness , shuffling ) will usually obtain different probability mass functions .",
    "a difficulty with growth processes , including , is that although they satisfy defn .",
    "[ defn : sfprocess ] of scale - free processes , the power - law  @xmath25 is implicitly defined . in some cases ( although not for pa ) it is not clear that @xmath25 is necessarily the same for all graphs generated for fixed growth parameters .",
    "depending on the initial seed graph , it is possible to imagine growth processes which would converge to different power - laws .",
    "in contrast , one of the advantages of configuration models is the mean histogram  @xmath40 is prescribed : the process configures nodes with pre - defined degrees into a network  @xcite .    even if two processes generate scale - free graphs by defn .",

    "has served that propose , principally because it is a simple growth process .",
    "unfortunately , it is not a satisfactory standard for many reasons we already indicated : it has a limited range of  @xmath25 ( _ typically _ @xmath25 is constrained to be between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; for @xmath45 and @xmath46 one obtains @xmath47 ) ; @xmath16 and @xmath25 are implicitly defined ; and , is subject to well known biases of several basic network measures ( such as assortativity ) .",
    "we propose that the best standard against which to compare processes that generate scale - free networks is a _ maximum entropy _ process   with prescribed mean histogram  @xmath40 . a maximum entropy process samples all graphs with mean histogram  @xmath40 with the least bias or emphasis of structures and features that are not common features of all such graphs .    [ defn : maxentropy ] the _ maximum entropy process",
    "uniformly samples @xmath32 by the multinomial distribution of  @xmath16 , and uniformly samples graphs with the histogram  @xmath32 .",
    "that is , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50    the process   generates connected graphs with maximum entropy from the specified degree sequence partitions all graphs in  @xmath7 into equivalence classes by histogram  @xmath32 , and uniformly samples these  ( [ eq : uniform ] ) , hence , achieving maximum entropy within these equivalence classes .",
    "moreover , the sampling of  @xmath32 uses a multinomial distribution  ( [ eq : multinomial ] ) , which is the maximum entropy process for selecting a histogram with frequencies  @xmath16 .",
    "hence , even though the degrees of nodes within a graph are not independent , the degrees of nodes of successive randomly generated graphs behave as though they were independent .",
    "that is , maximum entropy is a consequence of selecting degree histogram by multinomial sampling and thence uniform sampling from within that degree histogram .",
    "this is equivalent to the work presented by bianconi @xcite for selecting maximum entropy for a specified ensemble .",
    "for us , degree distribution and connectivity constraints dictate the ensemble of interest .    for details on how to efficiently implement  @xmath51 , see algorithm  [ alg : mep ] in [ app : mainalg ] .",
    "a _ maximum entropy _",
    "process  @xmath51 can be implemented by as a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc )  @xcite , however , a naive mcmc implementation could converge slowly and not be effective for large graphs  @xcite .",
    "the key ideas of algorithm  [ alg : mep ] are that the equivalence class of graphs with the same degree histogram can be sampled uniformily by a process of _ edge switching _",
    "@xcite , and a cannonical graph with a given degree histogram can be constructed by the havel - hakimi process  @xcite .",
    "combining these key ingredients with a test for connectivity  @xcite provides a sufficient algorithm .",
    "following bianconi @xcite we define the maximum entropy scale free network ensemble as follows .",

    "will serve as our standard against which scale - free graphs and scale - free graph generators are compared .",
    "in this section we use algorithm  [ alg : mep ] to explore what are the typical properties of scale - free networks , and moreover , infer that pa networks exhibit an atypical `` hub - centric '' structure .",
    "power - law distributions alone imply that the degree distribution has a long tail and some nodes in the tail must have high degree , but the presence of `` hubs '' implies something more and are often said to `` hold the network together '' .",
    "what we observe in the following is something more than this .",
    "there are three properties to which we refer with the term `` hub - centric '' ( which we define later in an algorithmic sense ) : ( i ) the distribution of hubs throughout the network , ( ii ) their interconnection , and ( iii ) their connection with low - degree nodes .",
    "the presence or absence of these three properties determine , to a very great extent , many of the global properties of a scale - free network .",
    "moreover , we observe that pa networks exhibit properties which are atypical of the broader class .    however , before moving to the conclusion that the difference between these two types of networks is due to the hub - centric properties of pa networks , we first present a numerical study of the various main measures of network geometry : assortativity , clustering coefficient and diameter .",
    "we apply these measures to various different families of scale - free networks to highlight the wide variation which is possible .",
    "we will also explore other prominent features  most importantly : ( i ) the robustness to targeted worst - case attacks ( i.e. `` attack vulnerability '' @xcite ) on hubs ; and ( ii ) a detailed motif analysis .    for our comparison experiments we generate four types of pa@xmath57 networks , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for given @xmath8 and  @xmath0",
    "we generate a sample from pa@xmath57 of  @xmath60 graphs  @xmath61 , @xmath62 . from a degree histogram",

    "results reported in the following are for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "computation with other values produced comparable results . in the following subsections",
    "we examine each of the network properties outlined above , starting with motif rank and then robustness .",
    "the motif , defined as a small connected subgraph that recurs in a graph , is the basic building block , or functional unit , of complex networks @xcite . in real - world networks ( e.g. gene regulatory networks )",
    ", the relative frequencies of different motifs often represent different functions of the network @xcite .",
    "moreover , it sheds light on the structure of the whole network .",
    "we restrict our analysis here to the four - node motifs , and classify them into three groups ( based on the number of edges in the constituent motifs , see fig .",
    "[ motif ] ) : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "measuring the relative frequency of each of these groups allows us to determine the proportion of building blocks typical of the sparse , moderate , and dense networks .",
    "the result of the motif analysis is also shown in fig .  [ motif ] .    .",
    "on the left , are the results for preferential attachment , on the right , the uniform sampling algorithm . for each network , or ( denoted in the figure as unis ) with specified @xmath0 ,",
    "we compute the frequency of each of the size possible arrangements of four - node path - connected subgraphs ( labelled a to f ) and then plot the absolute ( logarithmic ) frequency of occurrence of each graph . the order from most to least",
    "frequent is also provided.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    from fig.[motif ] , there is an apparent difference between the motif distribution of these two type of networks : as @xmath0 increases , the motif frequencies of pa networks become larger , and the `` dense '' motifs of type @xmath73 occur more frequently than the less dense type @xmath74  suggesting that the pa networks are denser than the corresponding networks .",
    "this would be a natural consequence of the pa networks becomes more hub - centric ( more cross links between hubs ) as @xmath0 increases , while the hubs of the network remain more evenly distributed ( less cross - links between hubs , and correspondingly fewer `` dense '' motifs ) .      due to the long tail of the power - law distribution , scale - free networks",
    "are often claimed to be simultaneously robust to the random loss of nodes ( i.e. `` error tolerance '' ) and fragile to targeted worst - case attacks @xcite .",
    "the robustness is seen to be a consequence of the extremely high number of ( `` unimportant '' ) low degree nodes , the fragility is due to the extremely important role of the hubs .",
    "this property is also called the `` achilles heel '' of pa networks , or the `` robust yet fragile '' feature .",
    "intuitively , the inhomogeneous connectivity distribution of many networks caused by the power - law distribution would possess these two properties .",
    "however , from our analysis , networks generated by sampling uniformly from the family of all scale free networks do not exhibit this second property .",
    "again , we may attribute this to the hub - centric nature of pa networks .",
    "we quantify the robustness to targeted attacks by specific removal of the most highly connected ( or important ) nodes until the network is disconnected .",
    "we then take the number of the nodes removed as a measure . for illustration",
    ", we use degree and betweenness centrality ( bc ) of a vertex as measures with which to target nodes for removal .",
    "roughly , bc is defined as the number of geodesics ( shortest paths ) going through a vertex : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is total number of shortest paths between node @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the number of those paths that pass through @xmath80 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ robu ] .",
    "the case of targeted attack is trivial for @xmath67 , in which situation the networks are highly likely to be trees .",
    "hence , we restrict our analysis for the case where @xmath81 .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ robu ] . from fig .",
    "[ robu ] , it is safe to conclude that the network is much more robust than the corresponding pa network when facing targeted attack .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the pa networks are more hub - centric , while the networks are not .",
    "the fragility of the pa networks is due to the placement of hubs within the network  not the scale - free - ness of the network _ per se . _    .",
    "results for pa are plotted as a solid blue line and and results for are plotted as a red dashed line .",
    "histograms are computed with logarithmically equally space bins  the same binning is used for both network construction methods .",
    "we find that , networks are , for @xmath82 , an order of magnitude more robust to targeted attack than typical pa networks.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]      in this section we present the difference between the pa networks and networks by computing the widely quoted numerical network properties :    * _ diameter _ : the maximal shortest path length .",

    "all these discrepancies point to the fact that as @xmath0 increases , the pa network becomes more and more hub - centric , while the network remain highly uniform  and the high degree nodes remain evenly distributed throughout the networks .",

    "note that the hub - centric structure is a global property of the network , since only modification on a small portion of pa networks ( such as the case with the so - called `` rich - club '' phenomena @xcite ) is not sufficient : when we only make the modification described in @xcite to manipulate rich - club connections the pa and network statistical distributions remain disparate",
    ". therefore , the modification scheme we propose in the following applies across the entire network structure  from super - rich nodes and hubs , to the poorest nodes . to maintain conciseness and focus ,",
    "we present the brief idea of our modifications scheme here ; for details see algorithm  [ alg : spread ] of [ modification ] . in the following paragraphs we outline these two modification schemes",

    "the aim of these computations is to show that these modifications alone are sufficient to align the corresponding distributions of network structural properties ( assortativity and so on ) .",
    "the modification scheme for an initial pa network is the following .",
    "first , we cut the links within the group of rich nodes and between rich nodes and the group of poor nodes as far as possible while preserving the connectivity of the network .",
    "then , we use the algorithm described in @xcite among the giant nodes ( which we define as the nodes whose degree is even larger than the typical rich nodes ) , to reconstruct the structure of the rich nodes .",
    "that is , we obtain networks with minimal interconnection between hubs , minimal connection from hubs to low degree nodes , but a similar rich - club structure ( the interconnection among the super hubs ) . after setting the thresholds @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in alg .",
    "[ alg : spread ] ( [ modification ] ) , we apply this modification to the case with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "the results for @xmath88 are similar , but omitted for conciseness .    from the calculations of fig .",
    "[ mod1 ] we see that the modification of the pa scheme ( removing the hub - centric properties of such networks ) allows us to produce network statistics which have a distribution similar to the unmodified uniform sampling scheme ( for the local clustering coefficient and assortativity @xcite , at least ) or bracketing the expected distribution for ( for the maximum diameter ) .",
    "although this bracketing  by modifying the hub - centric nature of the pa network we go from smaller than to larger that  does not immediately provide indistinguishable statistical distributions , it is clear that this is due only to the unselective manner in which we choose the threshold parameters for this algorithm .",
    "changing these parameters effects a continuous change in these statistical distributions .",

    "[ rev3 ] , after generating hubs by artificially reconstructing the structure of networks , the numerical analysis of networks indicates statistical distributions of structural properties which approach that of pa networks  supporting our claim that hub - centric structure in pa networks makes them atypical of random scale - free graphs .    by modifying the properties of a uniformly sampled network we are able to produce distributions of maximum diameter and global clustering coefficient very similar to that observed for the pa",
    "that is , we add hub - centric structure to network and achieve statistical features similar to that typical of pa networks .",
    "we do not achieve such good agreement for assortativity and local clustering coefficient .",
    "nonetheless , taken together fig .",
    "[ mod1 ] and  [ rev3 ] show that matching distributions can be achieved by _ either _ adding or removing the hub - centric features in each of the four statistics that we examine here .",
    "hence , the features which we modify with the algorithms described in [ modification ] are exactly the properties of pa networks that are atypical of the broader distribution of properties of scale free networks when sampled by a maximum entropy process . the only caveat being that the two algorithms are not exactly inverses of one another , and , in particular , measures of global clustering hint at further unexplored diversity in the global structure of typical scale free networks ( as the networks become progressively more tree like , even for @xmath82 ) .      to conclude this section , we now collate the results of our analysis . we see that the hubs of a pa network `` hold '' that network together .",
    "the strength of interconnection among hubs ( and connection with low degree nodes ) may be explained by preferential attachment itself . in that growth model , once nodes and links are added , they will never be altered again .",
    "this , we claim , causes inhomogeneity in pa networks .",
    "the largest hubs will always ( with probability approaching one ) be the earliest nodes in the growing network and these nodes are necessarily closely interlinked .",
    "conversely , the last nodes added to the network will have minimal degree and yet these nodes will ( with very high probability ) be directly connect to the hubs .",
    "in fact , it is clear that the last nodes added ( those with the lowest degree ) are _ most _ likely to be connected directly to the hubs  this is a consequence of the fact that the attachment bias favouring the original rich nodes increases with growth of the network  loosely speaking , that the `` rich get richer '' .",
    "these are precisely the properties we alluded to earlier with our description of `` hub - centric '' networks , and , these are precisely the properties which are adjusted by the modification algorithms  [ alg : spread ] and  [ alg : concentrate ] of [ modification ] .",
    "the consequences of this hub - centric structure of pa networks is two - fold . _ first _ ,",
    "since pa is an elegant and intuitive way to generate graphs , there may exist some generation procedures in the real world which are similar to preferential attachment , and thus we can use this claim to illustrate the hub - centric structure in such growth networks .",
    "this observation has potential for practical use  for example , with hub detection in control of disease transmission , or , to control of a network by manipulating the hubs .",
    "_ second _ , such a claim also indicates that there is systematic bias with pa networks .",
    "this bias will lead to difficulty when using pa networks to explain real world networks which do not result from such a constrained growth process  even when the degree sequence of each network satisfies the power law distribution .",
    "in this section , we introduce a variant of the surrogate data test , proposed for nonlinear time series analysis , to interpret real world networks .",
    "we proceed by generating an ensemble of random networks , both similar to the observed data - based network ( in that they share the same degree distribution ) and yet , at the same time , random . by comparing the properties of the real network with the corresponding distribution of networks we can determine whether the particular network is typical .",
    "our observations here are both a consequence of the previous section and a motivation for the development of a network surrogate test .    just like the surrogate data methods for time series , results will depend on the choice of test statistic .",
    "we will see that certain test statistics indicate clear and systematic deviation between the maximum entropy realisations and particular experimental systems .",
    "this can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "_ first _ , as a straight - forward hypothesis test .",
    "rejection on the basis of any particular statistic indicates that the observed network is not typical of the maximum entropy class .",
    "however , we are also able to be more particular . hence , _",
    "second _ , we can apply this method to determine which particular features of the observed network are atypical .",
    "hence we provide a more sensitive classification scheme dependent on individual features of the network .",
    "in what follows we will see that this is very often the case  it is particular features of the networks that differ , rather than _ all _ aspects _ simultaneously .",
    "_    we will start with a brief discussion of robustness . as we saw above ,",
    "pa networks are vulnerable to targeted attack , while networks do nt have such an evident `` achilles heel '' .",
    "recent research into the structure of several important complex networks shows that , even if their degree distribution could have an approximately power - law tail , the networks in question are robust to targeted attack to some degree : the most highly connected nodes do not necessarily represent an `` achilles heel '' .",
    "in particular , recent results of modeling the router - level internet has shown that the core of that network is constructed from a mesh of high bandwidth , low - connectivity routers , and @xcite concludes that although power - law degree distributions imply the presence of high - degree vertices , they do not imply that such nodes form a necessarily `` crucial hub '' . a related line of research into the structure of biological metabolic networks",
    "have shown that claims of sf structure fail to capture the most essential biochemical as well as `` robust yet fragile '' features of cellular metabolism and in many cases completely misinterpret the relevant biology  for example , @xcite indicates the removal of high degree nodes leaves the biosynthetic pathways fully intact .",
    "hence , real - world scale - free networks do , indeed , exhibit absence of the much - touted `` robustness '' properties .",
    "our model provides an explanation for that absence .    in the following",
    ", we will probe the limitation of the explanative power of pa networks via numerical statistics .",
    "we find that many real complex networks appear more `` uniform '' under our surrogate test .",
    "also , based on this result , we propose a simplistic classification of real world networks .",
    "such a classification could provide us with a new insight into the interior structure of real networks , to explore which property do make the networks interesting and special .",
    "our surrogate tests are developed in this way : for a real world network which satisfies the power - law distribution , we estimate its minimum vertex degree and power law exponent by using the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "we then use the relation @xmath4 in section @xmath96 to estimate its initial attractiveness , and then generate pa networks with controlled @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",
    "we then substitute @xmath25 and @xmath0 into algorithm  [ alg : mep ] to generate the networks . for each set of parameter values , we generate @xmath97 networks for and pa networks respectively . in fig .",

    "[ box1 ] we can conclude that , in terms of interpretation of real networks , networks provides a significantly better model for data from the internet topology , and metabolic and protein interaction networks",
    ". for cs phd collaboration and us airport connection networks , is slightly better than pa .",
    "however , for erds collaboration network , neither nor pa networks is good , although the statistics of pa networks are closer to that of the erds network than networks .",
    "to examine the case of erds collaboration network more closely , we plot the motif rank and various other statistics of the erds collaboration networks in fig .",
    "[ erdosmotif ] .",
    "this figure suggests that the hub - centric structure in the erds collaboration network is much more significant than pa allows : the erds collaboration network is a densely connected core along with loosely coupled radial branches reaching out from that core .",
    "erds practiced what he preached ",
    "he was a weaver of social networks and thus a builder of social capital .",
    "moreover , this collaboration network is specifically erds - centric  it is specifically focussed on that one unique hub and its connections .",
    "hence , the nodes closer to erds benefit most and become the strongest hubs ( after erds himself ) in the resultant network .    by comparison , it would be helpful for us to identify which properties differ most markedly between the real network and a random surrogate sample .. the cases where provides better representations would suggest , for instance , that the structure of protein interaction networks is more uniform , because the cellular ecosystem necessitates such stableness ; and , in the case of the the internet on the level of automatic system , the system is balanced and distributed in a rather deliberate way .",
    "both these systems have been `` engineered '' for robustness .",
    "finally , we note that neither the nor pa networks performs well in reproducing the diameter of the biological networks .",
    "it is curious that biological networks present abnormally large diameters  we speculate that this more spread - out tree - like structure is a consequence of the components of biological systems having specific functional roles .",
    "based on our results , we also note ( via analysis of robustness , motif and numerical statistics of a network , and comparison with its corresponding pa and networks ) that one can classify the real network in the sense of hub - structure : if its property is closer to the pa networks , we can conclude it is hub - centric and typically the result of a growth process .",
    "conversely , networks that are not pa are more likely to be purposefully widely distributed .",
    "we have proposed a new algorithm which allows us to make maximum - entropy random - samples of finite size graphs with the degree histogram being a probabilistic realization of a specified degree distribution .",
    "we focus on putative scale free networks as an illustrative example and use this method to generate random networks with power - law tail degree distributions of arbitrary @xmath25 ( exponent ) and @xmath0 ( minimum degree ) .",
    "this provides a simple alternative to the various generative processes in the literature .",
    "however , our approach has the benefit that it makes no particular biasing assumptions ( such a preferential attachment ) . to emphasize the need for this algorithm we compare our results to distributions of networks obtained from the widely applied pa scheme of @xcite . while there are many generative algorithms for scale - free networks ,",
    "pa is still the most widely used .",
    "hence , pa provides an excellent model of growth of a static network , however , we find that many real world networks do not conform to this model .",
    "this is not a new observation , however , it is still an important point to emphasise  growth ( and preferential attachment in particular ) are not adequate models to explain all observed scale - free networks .",
    "we propose particular structural modification algorithms to uncover exactly how pa is atypical of what one would expect of maximum entropy .",
    "we found the high - degree nodes in pa networks are hub - centric , and that this hub - centric - ness has a greater influence on the overall structure than attributable only to the high - degree nodes themselves .",
    "in particular we attribute the co - called `` robust yet fragile '' feature found in many scale free networks to the distribution of hubs achieved via preferential attachment .",
    "our observation sod the hub - centric - ness of preferential attachment scale free networks helps us assess the contribution of hubs in real world networks to the overall network structure .",
    "the surrogate network generation method we describe allows us to provide a robust numerical measure of this rich variation among scale - free complex networks .",
