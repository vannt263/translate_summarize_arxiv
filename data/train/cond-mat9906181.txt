    "pulsed electric field ( pef ) treatment is a new and promising nonthermal processing method for heterogeneous cellular materials .",
    "pef methods are based on the effect of cell transformation or rupture under an external electric field , which results in increase of the electric conductivity and permeability of cellular material .",
    "this effect known as dielectric breakdown ( zimmermann , pilwat & riemann , 1974 ) , or electroplasmolysis ( scheglov , 1983 ) , can be explained generally by electroporation , i.e. , electric field induced formation and growth of pores in biological membranes resulting from their polarization .",
    "the method of electroporation became very popular because it was found to be an exceptionally practical way of transferring drugs , genetic material ( e.g. dna ) , or other molecules inside the cells ( chang , chassy , saunders & sowers , 1992 ) .",
    "recently , scientists began to use the pef methods for treatment of liquid food ( fruit juices , milk etc . ) , as an alternative to high temperature preservation ( barbosa - canovas , pothakamury , palou & swanson , 1998 ; hulsheger , potel & niemann , 1983 ) .",
    "pef protocols also have been recently introduced for cellular tissue treatment ( knorr , geulen , grahl & sitzmann , 1994 ; knorr , 1997 ) .    however , presently the wide spreading of pef treatment for the purposes of nonthermal processing of heterogeneous cellular materials is restrained by the poor reproducibility of experimental data , the unclear mechanism of dielectric breakdown in the cellular systems , and the absence of criteria for choosing optimal parameters of hefp treatment .",
    "the most optimal for the tasks of this kind is to apply computer simulation methods .",
    "there exist many types of models for simulation of dynamic breakage processes in random disordered systems .",
    "the most popular is the model of random resistor ( or random conductor ) networks ( arcangelis , redner & herrmann , 1985 ; duxbury & beale , 1995 ) . the models of this type are applied for simulation of the physical behavior of granular superconductor , metal - insulator composites and various other disordered materials .",
    "usually , the breakdown process kinetics is investigated at the network models of different types through the iterative solving of the ohm - kirchhoff s system of equations with allowance for boundary conditions and with choosing the relevant initial conditions for breakdown initialization ( lebovka & mank , 1992 ) .",
    "but all the above mentioned models are highly time consuming and they require a lot of cpu - time for the real cellular material simulation ( press , teukolsky , vetterling & flannery , 1997 ) .    the objective of this study is to develop the simulation model describing the breakage kinetics under conditions of pef treatment and to correlate experimental data for heterogeneous cellular materials with simulation results .",
    "we consider the very simplified model of cellular material breakage under the pef , which is based on a generalised approximation of effective medium .",
    "this model takes into account the percolation properties of medium and local bridging effects .",
    "this approach is , certainly , rather rough , same as all the other effective medium approaches , but it allows us to obtain the realistic description of breakage processes and trends of kinetics .",
    "we consider at first the case of an individual cell inside the homogeneous medium having a low effective conductivity @xmath7 placed into an external electric field of strength @xmath8 .",
    "the maximum voltage @xmath9 between the internal and external cellular surfaces of membrane ( or transmembrane voltage ) induced on cell poles by the external field , is equal to ( neumann , sprafke , & boldt , 1992 ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the geometry factor equal to 0.75 for the spherical geometry of cell and to 1 for a cell of cubic geometry , and @xmath12 depends on the electrical and geometrical properties of the cell ( kotnik , miklavcic & slivnik , 1998 ) @xmath13    taking into account the low conductivity of membrane , @xmath14@xmath151 and expanding eq .",

    "we shall consider further on only the cells of cubic geometry , so we put @xmath26 . in this approximation",
    ", @xmath12 is equal to the normalised transmembrane voltage @xmath27 .",
    "now we consider a problem of transmembrane voltage @xmath9 estimation for a cell inside a biological tissue . in this case , the external media is not homogeneous , so , eqs .",
    "( [ e01 ] ) and ( [ e02 ] ) are inaccurate .",
    "they can be used only as approximate estimation by assuming a certain effective value of @xmath7 .",
    "this is just the mean field ( mf ) type of approximation , which does not take local conductivity fluctuations into account .",
    "it can be assumed , as a rough approximation , that in an inhomogeneous medium the equation ( [ e01 ] ) may also be used for determination of the @xmath9 values , however , @xmath28 will depend on the space co - ordinate @xmath29 and will vary from cell to cell .    as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ e03 ] ) , the value of f gradually increases with the increase of external medium effective conductivity @xmath7 , which depends on the biological tissue destruction degree , @xmath30 . here",
    "we define the biological tissue destruction degree as :    @xmath31    as a more precise estimation of @xmath7 versus @xmath30 dependence , we have used the generalised effective media equation with the same morphology parameters as in percolation theory ( mclachlan , 1989 ) :    @xmath32    this equation reduces to the well - known bruggeman s symmetric equation when @xmath33 ( landauer , 1978 ) . everywhere throughout this work we use the values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which are typical for the 3d simple cubic lattice ( sahimi , 1993 ) . in the general case",

    "such fluctuations are especially high near the punctured cells , where the local values of conductivity can exceed the effective average value @xmath7 by some orders of magnitude .",
