    "they can be understood in terms of two factors : the initial h abundance , which determines the quantity of available fuel , and the luminosity of the star , which fixes the rate at which this fuel burns .    at @xmath7 , @xmath45 is mainly determined by @xmath21 , being shorter at higher luminosities . the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] confirms , as expected from @xmath21 ( see left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , that @xmath45 increases with @xmath1 in low- and intermediate - mass stars , and is about independent of @xmath1 in massive stars .    at @xmath46 , on the other hand , the initial h abundance decreases sharply with increasing @xmath1 ( the h depletion law is dictated by the adopted @xmath47 law ; for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath3 drops from 0.69 at @xmath50 to 0.42 at @xmath22 ) .",
    "the ms lifetimes are then mainly dictated by the amount of fuel available .",

    "this result is independent of the stellar mass for @xmath51 m@xmath16 . above this mass",
    ", however , the action of mass loss ( see below ) extends the ms lifetime , as can be seen from the 60 m@xmath16 curve in the left part of fig .",

    "( 1989 , see also vink et al .",
    "2001 ) showed that @xmath52 in o stars is proportional to @xmath53 . as a result ,",
    "the effects of mass loss dominate in more metal - rich stars .",
    "the stellar masses remaining at the end of the ms phase for various mass loss rate prescriptions are shown in the left part of fig .",
    "the most striking result at metallicities higher than twice solar is the rapid evaporation of massive stars with @xmath54 m@xmath16 , and the consequent formation of wr stars during core h burning .",
    "the effects of shellular rotation on the evolution of massive star models at high metallicity have been discussed in meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) .",
    "as at lower metallicity , rotation induces mixing in the stellar interiors .",
    "however as was discussed in maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) , rotational mixing tends to be less efficient in metal rich stars .",
    "this can be seen looking at the 9 m@xmath16 stellar model in the left part of fig .",
    "this comes from the fact that the gradients of @xmath55 are much less steep in the higher metallicity models , so they trigger less efficient shear mixing .",
    "the gradients are shallower because less angular momentum is transported outwards by meridional currents , whose velocity scales as the inverse of the density in the outer layers ( see the gratton - pick term in the expression for the meridional velocity in maeder & zahn  1998 )",
    ". looking at the 40 m@xmath16 stellar model in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one sees that the higher metallicity model presents the highest surface enrichments , in striking contrast with the behaviour of the 9 m@xmath16 model .",
    "this comes from the fact that in the upper part of the hr diagram the evolution of stars is more dominated by the mass loss rate than by rotation . and the changes occurring at the surface of the 40 m@xmath16 are thus not only due to rotation but also to mass loss which is more efficient at higher @xmath1 .    in the high mass range at high metallicity , the stars have less chance to reach the critical velocity during the main sequence phase as can be seen from the right part of fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that stellar winds remove the angular momentum at the surface , preventing thus the outer layers to reach the critical limit .",
    "let us note that for smaller initial masses , a high metallicity may favor the approach to the critical limit . indeed , in that case , the stellar winds are too weak , even at high metallicity , to remove a lot of mass and therefore of angular momentum , while , the meridional currents , which bring angular momentum from the inner regions of the star to the surface , are more rapid due to the lower densities achieved in the outer layers of metal rich stars .",
    "another point which should be kept in mind at this point is that , at very high metallicity , the stars may lose large amounts of mass without losing too much angular momentum .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the high velocity regime , the stellar winds are polar ( maeder & meynet 2001 ) .",
    "let us stress however that this situation has little chance to be realised at high metallicity .",
    "indeed the timescales for mass loss are likely shorter than the timescale for the torque due to wind anisotropy to affect the surface velocity .    .",

    "at high metallicity , as a result of the metallicity dependence of the mass loss rates , one expects larger fractions of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( maeder et al .",

    "[ fig5 ] where the wr lifetimes of rotating models for four metallicities are plotted as a function of the initial mass .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the mass loss rates is responsible for two features : 1 ) for a given initial mass and velocity the wr lifetimes are greater at higher metallicities . typically at z=0.040 and for m",
    "@xmath58 60 @xmath59 the wr lifetime is of the order of 2 myr , while at the metallicity of the smc the wr lifetimes in this mass range are between 0.40.8 myr ; 2 ) the minimum mass for a single star to evolve into the wr phase is lower at higher metallicity",
    ".    comparisons with observed populations of wr stars are shown in meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) . when the variation with the metallicity of the number ratio of wr to o - type stars is considered , good agreement is obtained provided models with rotation are used .",
    "models without rotation predict much too small fractions of wr to o - type stars , even at high metallicity .",
    "this illustrates the fact that even at high metallicity , where the effects of the mass loss rates are dominant , one can not neglect the effects of rotation .",
    "models well reproduce the variation with @xmath1 of the wc / wn ratio at low metallicity , but underestimate this ratio at high @xmath1 ( see fig .  11 in meynet & maeder 2005 ) .",
    "it might be that the mass loss rates during the post ms wnl phase are underestimated .",
    "also , the metallicity dependence of the wr stellar winds may help in resolving this disagreement ( see eldridge and vink 2006 ) .",
    "current knowledge associates supernovae of type ib / ic with the explosion of wr stars , the h  rich envelope of which has been completely removed either by stellar winds and/or by mass transfer through roche lobe overflow in a close binary system .",
    "if we concentrate on the case of single star models , theory predicts that the fraction of supernovae progenitors without h - rich envelope with respect to h - rich supernovae should be higher at higher metallicity .",
    "the reason is the same as the one invoked to explain the increasing number ratio of wr to o  type stars with metallicity , namely the growth of the mass loss rates with @xmath1 . until recently very little observational evidence has been found confirming this predicted behaviour",
    "the situation began to change with the work by prantzos & boissier  ( 2003 ) .",
    "these authors have derived from published data the observed number ratios of type ib / ic supernovae to type ii supernovae for different metallicities .",
    "the regions considered are regions of constant star formation rate .",
    "their results are plotted in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "looking at this figure , it clearly appears that rotating models give a much better fit to the observed data than non  rotating models .",
    "this comparison can be viewed as a check of the lower initial mass limit m@xmath60 of the stars evolving into a wr phase without hydrogen .",
    "let us note also at this point that at high metallicity , no type ic supernovae are expected to occur ( supernovae showing no trace of h and he ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the high mass loss which allows the star to enter at an early stage into the wc phase when still a lot of helium has to be transformed into carbon and oxygen .",
    "the star thus keeps a high abundance of helium at its surface until the presupernova stage and explodes as a type ib supernova . at low metallicities ,",
    "since the mass loss rates are weaker , the star may enter ( if it does ) at a later stage of the core he - burning phase , when already most of the helium has been transformed into carbon and oxygen ( see smith & maeder 1991 ) . in that case",
    "the star may explode as a type ic supernova .",
    "this might explain why long soft gamma ray bursts associated to type ic supernovae only occur in metal poor regions ( hirschi et al .",

    "let us begin this section by recalling a few orders of magnitudes .",
    "when single stars form with a salpeter s imf , about 14% of the mass locked into stars consists of massive stars , _ i.e. _ with masses greater than 8 m@xmath16 , 25% are locked into stars of masses between 1 and 8 m@xmath16 and 61% in stars with masses between 0.1 and 1 m@xmath16 .",
    "when all the stars with masses above 1 m@xmath16 have died , about 13% of the mass initially locked into stars is ejected by massive stars ( 1% remains locked into black holes or neutron stars ) .",
    "the intermediate mass stars ( from 1 to 8 m@xmath16 ) eject about 18.5% of the mass initially locked into stars ( 6.5% remains locked in white dwarfs ) .",
    "figure 6 shows for various models at different metallicities the fraction of the mass in stars which is eventually ejected under the form of new elements .",
    "the part ejected by stellar winds is distinguished from that ejected at the time of the supernova explosion .",
    "one sees that on the whole , the fraction of the mass initially locked into stars and transformed into new elements by the massive stars does not depend too much on the model or on the metallicity .",
    "all the results are comprised between 3.5 and 4.5% .",
    "one notes however that more variations appear when one looks at the proportions of these new elements ejected by the winds and the supernova explosion .",
    "indeed at higher metallicity a greater part of the new elements synthesized by stars are ejected by stellar winds as can be see in fig  [ fig6 ] . typically the non - rotating stellar models of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) predict that a stellar population at @xmath0 ejects in the form of new elements during the supernova explosion a little less than 4% of the total mass used to form the stars .",
    "models at solar metallicity and higher eject about half of their new elements at the time of the supernova explosion and the rest through stellar winds .",
    "this may have a great influence on the final yields as has been shown by maeder ( 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , mass loss removes matter at earlier evolutionary stages .",
    "the ejected matter has therefore been partially processed by nuclear burning and has a chemical composition different from the one it would have if the matter would have remained locked in the star .",
    "this effect is responsible for many specific enrichments at high metallicity : for instance , because of this effect , massive star models are expected to be stronger sources of @xmath61he , @xmath62c , @xmath63ne , @xmath64al and to be less important sources of @xmath65o at high metallicity than at low metallicity .",
    "the cases of helium , carbon and oxygen is shown in fig  [ fig7 ] .",
    "we can see the importance of mass loss for the carbon yields .",
    "indeed the larger yields are obtained for the models computed with enhanced mass loss rates .",
    "it is interesting here to note that high mass loss is not a sufficient condition for obtaining high carbon yields .",
    "high carbon yields are obtained only when the star enters into the wc phase at an early stage of the core he - burning phase .",
    "this can be seen comparing the 60 m@xmath16 stellar model at @xmath30 computed by meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) with the 60 m@xmath16 stellar model at @xmath50 with enhanced mass loss rate computed by maeder ( 1992 ) .",
    "these two models end their lifetimes with similar final masses ( the model of meynet & maeder 2005 with 6.7 m@xmath16 and the model of maeder 1992 with 7.8 m@xmath16 ) , thus the mass of new carbon ejected at the time of the supernova explosion is quite similar for both models and is around 0.45 m@xmath16 . when one compares the mass of new carbon ejected by the winds , we obtain 7.3 and 0.16 m@xmath16 for respectively the model of maeder ( 1992 ) and the one of meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) .",
    "this difference arises from the fact that the model with enhanced mass loss enters the wc phase at a much earlier time of the core he - burning phase , typically when the mass fraction of helium at the centre , @xmath66 is 0.43 and the actual mass of the star is 25.8 m@xmath16 , while the model of meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) enters the wc stage when @xmath66 is 0.24 and the actual mass 8.6 m@xmath16 .",
    "the example above shows that the entry at an early stage into the wc phase is more favored by strong mass loss than by rotation .",
    "this comes from the fact that rotation favors an early entry into the wn phase , while the star has still an important h - rich envelope .",
    "it takes time for the whole h - rich envelope to be removed and when it is done , the star is already well advanced into the core he - burning phase .",
    "of course this conclusion is quite dependent on the magnitudes of the mass loss rates .",
    "for instance higher mass loss rates during ( a part of ) the wnl phase would favor an early entrance into the wc phase . this would give a better agreement with the number ratio of wc to wn observed and would lead to higher carbon yields .",
    "let us conclude this paper by estimating an empirical yield in carbon from the wolf - rayet stars in the solar neighborhood . from the catalogue by van der hucht ( 2001 ) one obtains that the number of wc stars at a distance less than 3 kpc around the sun is 44 .",
    "the mass loss rate during the wc phase is estimated to be 10@xmath67 m@xmath16 per year , the mass fraction of carbon observed in the wc stellar wind is around 0.35 ( see table 2 in the review by crowther 2006 ) .",
    "if we consider a star formation rate of 2 - 4 m@xmath16 per square parsec and per gyr , one obtains that the mass of ( new ) carbon ejected by wc wind per mass used to form stars is between 0.25 and 0.5% .",
    "these empirical yields are well in lines with the range of values given by the models which are between 0.2 - 0.6% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the greatest value corresponding to the case of maeder 1992 ) .",
    "let us note that incorporating the yields of maeder ( 1992 ) into chemical evolution models has an important impact ( see e.g. prantzos et al .",
    "if the upper value of the empirical yields is the correct one then this indicates that wc stars are very important sources of carbon in metal rich regions ."
