    "the subject of atom - light interaction has received considerable attention with the advent of sophisticated techniques to trap and cool atomic systems and measure their properties to very high precision @xcite .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the electric dipole polarizabilities of the atomic states are essential in these experiments as they are required in the studies of atomic interactions in optical lattices , atomic clocks , quantum information and many other important areas of atomic and molecular physics @xcite .",
    "this range of applications of electric dipole polarizabilities ( @xmath0 ) puts a premium on their accurate determination in atomic systems .",
    "precise measurements of @xmath0 are challenging and involve using a number of techniques like deflection of atomic beam by electric field @xcite , e - h balance method @xcite , atom interferometry @xcite , cold atom velocity change @xcite et cetera .",
    "in fact , the ground state @xmath0 of many atomic systems are not yet measured very precisely owing to difficulties in eliminating some of the larger systematics .",
    "therefore , accurate theoretical studies of electric dipole polarizabilities in atomic systems are of particular interest .",
    "dalgarno and his collaborators initiated work on the polarizabilities of many - electron atoms more than five decades ago @xcite .",
    "currently one of the most advanced approaches to this property is based on the linear response coupled cluster theory @xcite .",
    "we had formulated a relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method to calculate polarizabilities in which the electric dipole operator was effectively treated as a perturbation @xcite .",
    "the first order perturbed rcc wave function in this case was obtained by solving an inhomogeneous equation , thereby circumventing the sum - over - states approach @xcite .",
    "this method has been used to compute the polarizabilities of the ground states for a number of atomic systems @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we apply our method to some systems that we had studied earlier in addition to many new candidates for acquiring insights into the behavior of electron correlation in the calculations of the static electric dipole polarizabilities of these systems .",
    "we have included higher order non - linear rcc terms through special computational techniques , thereby improving our previous results .",
    "we present our dirac - fock ( df ) , third order many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt(3 ) ) and rcc results to show the quantitative changes in correlation effects in the passage from finite order mbpt to rcc and we offer explanations for this behavior .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we present briefly the theory of static electric dipole polarizability and the basic working equations for its evaluation in the framework of the method that we have developed .",
    "then , we describe the procedure for obtaining the atomic wave function and the electric dipole polarizability using the rcc method .",
    "this is followed by discussions of our results which are compared with the other calculations and measurements .",
    "we use atomic units ( au ) in this paper .",

    "we have given results by grouping the iso - electronic systems together in this table in order to make a comparative analysis of the correlation effects as the atomic number varies .",

    "finally , the ccsd results are larger than the df results for all these atoms .",
    "therefore this implies that there are strong cancellations between the correlation effects in these atoms and the higher order correlation effects play a pivotal role in determining the final results .",
    "a similar trend is also followed by other inert gas like singly charged alkali and doubly charged alkaline earth - metal ions . however , the trend for the correlation effects in the neutral alkaline earth - metal atoms is rather different . in this case the df results are always smaller than those of mbpt and ccsd .",
    "in fact , it is also quite interesting to note that the correlation trends for sc@xmath81 and y@xmath81 do not follow those of other iso - electronic alkaline earth - metal atoms , but rather of the inert gas atoms . for a quantitative description , we plot @xmath127 obtained using the mbpt(3 ) and ccsd methods versus atomic numbers in in fig .",

    "<S> we highlight their importance in improving the accuracies of @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the ground state @xmath0s of the inert gas atoms and several iso - electronic singly and doubly charged ions in order to make a comparative studies of the trends of the correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have developed a method to construct intermediate diagrams that are required for the computations of the unperturbed singles and doubles coupled - cluster amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> our rcc results are compared with those of many - body perturbation theory at different orders to demonstrate the importance of higher order correlation effects for the accurate determination of ( @xmath0s ) of the systems that we have considered . </S>"
