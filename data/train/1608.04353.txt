    "stars form in dense cores within molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent work has indicated that cores form preferentially in filaments within molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those cores that do not contain proto - stars are known generically as starless cores @xcite .",
    "when starless cores become dense enough to be gravitationally bound they are known as pre - stellar cores ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they then collapse to form class  0 @xcite and then class  i ( @xcite ; @xcite ) protostars , which can be seen as point - like sources in the near- and mid - infrared ( e.g. @xcite ) .        to trace the structure within molecular clouds , and particularly the filamentary structure , it is necessary to use the far - infrared ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the esa _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite has been especially successful in this regard ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the large collecting area and powerful science payload of _ herschel _ allows one to perform high - resolution , sensitive , mid- and far - infrared imaging photometry using the pacs @xcite and spire @xcite instruments  often simultaneously ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , _",
    "is so sensitive to molecular cloud structure  particularly spire  that it sees all of the cores within a cloud ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it detects many starless cores that are not pre - stellar in nature ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as those that are ( e.g. @xcite ) . consequently , if one is to confirm which cores are gravitationally bound ( pre - stellar ) , and hence destined to form stars , additional information is needed . the minimum information required in order to determine the virial balance of a starless core is a measure of the core s mass and size ( obtainable from submillimetre continuum observations ) and internal velocity dispersion ( requiring measurement of the core s internal linewidth ) .",
    "in order to accurately determine both the virial boundedness of the core and the mechanism by which it is confined ( i.e. by self - gravity or by external pressure ) , measures of the external pressure on and magnetic field strength within the core are also required ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "submillimetre continuum mapping identified the first genuine pre - stellar cores @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we test the hypothesis that submillimetre continuum mapping with the submillimetre common user bolometer array  2 ( scuba-2 ) camera can be used to discriminate between those cores detected by _",
    "herschel _ which are most likely to be gravitationally bound ( pre - stellar ) , and those which are unbound and transient in nature . in the absence of the spectroscopic data required to perform a virial analysis ,",
    "the stability of starless cores is often assessed using density - based criteria such as the jeans criterion @xcite or the bonnor - ebert criterion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these analyses ,",
    "denser cores are , for a given temperature , more likely to be gravitationally bound .",
    "the presence of the atmosphere means that ground - based submillimetre continuum mapping instruments must inevitably be subject to limitations on absolute sensitivity and large - scale structure recovery to which space - based instruments are not ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the selection effects introduced by these constraints may result in a ground - based detection , or otherwise , of a core detected using space - based instrumentation providing additional information about the properties of that core than the space - based data alone could provide .",
    "in this paper we identify and quantify the selection effects determining the detection , or otherwise , with scuba-2 of a starless core detected with _",
    "we further investigate whether these selection effects allow the identification of the densest cores in the _ herschel _ data through their detection , or otherwise , by scuba-2 .",
    "the l1495 region of taurus appears as an obscuring dark cloud on optical images ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with a linear , or filamentary , structure , coming to a head at a small globule that is referred to as l1495a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied the l1495 filament and found it to be consistent with the filamentary star formation model @xcite favoured by _",
    "herschel _ observations of star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence for asymmetric line profiles in the southern part of l1495a , apparently indicating collapse or contraction .",
    "however , this is close to the herbig ae / be star , v892  tau , which is clearly affecting at least the southern part of l1495a , so interpreting asymmetric line profiles is made more complex in this area .",
    "herschel _ data of the l1495 filament @xcite and follow - up ammonia data from the green bank telescope @xcite identified a number of pre - stellar cores in the l1495 filament .",
    "the scuba-2 observations presented here were carried out as part of the gould belt legacy survey ( gbls ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in hawaii @xcite .",

    "observations presented in this paper were carried out as part of the _ herschel _ gould belt survey ( hgbs ) guaranteed - time key programme @xcite .",

    "_ herschel _ observations of the southern part of the l1495 filament were presented by @xcite . in this paper",

    "the scuba-2 @xcite observations used here form part of the jcmt gould belt legacy survey ( gbls , @xcite ) .",
    "the l1495 region of the taurus molecular cloud was observed with the scuba-2 camera in 22 observations taken between october 2011 and july 2013 .",
    "continuum observations at 450 and 850  were made using fully sampled 15- , 30- , and 60-arcmin diameter circular regions ( pong900 , 1800 and 3600 mapping modes , @xcite ) .",

    "these data were presented by @xcite , in which full details of the observations are given .",
    "here , we briefly reiterate the key points .",
    "we only use the 850-  data .",
    "the data were reduced as part of the internal release 1 data set , using an iterative map - making technique ( _ makemap _ in smurf , @xcite ) , and gridded to 6-arcsec pixels at 850 .",
    "the iterations were halted when the map pixels , on average , changed by @xmath70.1% of the estimated map rms .",
    "the initial reductions of each individual scan were coadded to form a mosaic from which a signal - to - noise mask was produced for each region .",
    "the final mosaic was produced from a second reduction using this mask to define areas of emission .",
    "detection of emission structure and calibration accuracy are uncertain outside of the masked regions .",
    "the mask used in the reduction can be seen in the quality array in the reduced datafile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a spatial filter of 10 arcmin was used in the reduction , which means that flux recovery is robust for sources with a gaussian fwhm less than 2.5 arcmin .",
    "sources between 2.5 arcmin and 7.5 arcmin may be detected , but both the flux density and the size will be underestimated because fourier components with scales greater than 5 arcmin are essentially removed by this filtering process .",
    "detection of sources larger than 7.5 arcmin is dependent on the mask used for each reduction .",
    "the data were calibrated in jy / pixel , using an aperture flux conversion factor ( fcf ) of 2.34  jy / pw / arcsec@xmath8 at 850  , derived from average values of jcmt calibrators @xcite , and correcting for the pixel area .",
    "the pong scan pattern leads to lower noise in the map centre and overlap regions , while data reduction and emission artifacts can lead to small variations in the noise over the whole map .",

    "the comparison _",
    "data used in this paper were taken as part of the _ herschel _ gould belt survey @xcite and were presented by @xcite .",
    "they were taken simultaneously with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer , pacs @xcite , and the spectral and photometric imaging receiver , spire @xcite using the combined fast - scanning ( 60arcsec / s ) spire / pacs parallel mode .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details of the observations and the data reduction process .",
    "as scuba-2 is a ground - based instrument , while _ herschel _ is space - based , the ability of scuba-2 to recover submillimetre emission is restricted in comparison to _",
    "although the data sets used in this work are of similar sensitivity ( see below ) , the scuba-2 data are affected by selection effects due to atmospheric emission and variability , to which the _ herschel _ data are not .",
    "the result of this is that the emission detected by scuba-2 is a subset of that detected by _",
    "we here investigate what distinguishes those sources detected in both scuba-2",
    "850-  and _",
    "250-  emission from those detected in 250-  emission alone .",
    "we restrict our analysis to extended , starless sources , in order to be able to accurately characterise our sources using only data at wavelengths @xmath9100  and we use a modified blackbody emission model .",
    "the requirement for a scuba-2 detection of any source is a peaked 850-  surface brightness , as scuba-2 loses sensitivity to flux on larger spatial scales ( see above ) .",
    "thus , we hypothesise that the likely requirements for a scuba-2 detection of a starless core are for the core to be at high density ( thus having a high surface brightness ) , low temperature ( i.e. having a high ratio of long - wavelength to short - wavelength flux ) , and compactness ( i.e. being small enough not to lose emission to the scuba-2 spatial filtering ) . these properties",
    "are related to one another : for starless cores of the same mass , in the absence of local heating , a dense core is expected to be colder than a rarefied core ; and , trivially , a compact core will be denser than an extended core .",
    "the aim of this study is to distinguish which , if any , of these properties is of most importance in determining whether a starless core identified in _ herschel _ data will also be detectable in scuba-2 850-  emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : rgb ] shows a three - colour image of the region mapped with scuba-2 , in which 850  is shown in red , superposed on the same region from the _ herschel _ data , where 500  is shown in green and 250  is shown in blue .",
    "a number of cores and filaments can be seen .",
    "_ herschel _ detects most of the cloud structure , seen as blue - green emission on this image , including many filaments , as previously seen in other regions .",
    "we also see many cores along the filaments , consistent with the recently proposed hypothesis that core formation on filaments is the dominant mode of star formation @xcite .",
    "however , only some of the sources are picked out by scuba-2 , and show up as red in this image .",
    "the brightest source in figure  [ fig : rgb ] is l1495a .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] shows an enlargement of the l1495a region at each of the 6 wavelengths  5 from _ herschel _ and one from scuba-2 .",
    "it can be seen that only some of the sources and structures seen at other wavelengths are detected by scuba-2 .",
    "figures  [ fig : finding_chart1 ] and  [ fig : finding_chart2 ] show the full area covered at high signal - to - noise ratio by scuba-2 at 850  .",
    "l1495a can be seen clearly at all wavelengths in figures  [ fig : rgb ] and  [ fig : compare ] , including with scuba-2 at 850  .",
    "in fact , the brightest peak coincides with the southern part of l1495a , namely l1495a - s @xcite .",
    "the northern extension of l1495a , which is very much fainter , is l1495a - n @xcite . in the three - colour images in figure  [ fig : rgb ]",
    ", a colour gradient can be seen from south to north across l1495a , from blue to green .",
    "this would tend to indicate a temperature gradient across this core , with the hotter material in the south , consistent with these earlier findings .",
    "there is in fact a bright star , slightly further to the south of l1495a - s , which is v892 tau ( iras04155 + 2812 ) .",
    "this has a point source flux density in the iras catalogue of 30 jy at 12 microns and 100 jy at 25 microns , which declines slightly to 70 jy at 60 , before climbing again to 170 jy at 100 .",
    "the 100-  flux density almost certainly includes a contribution from l1495a - s , but otherwise , this is a herbig ae / be star , and it is clearly heating l1495a - s , which is otherwise starless . a similar pattern of an externally heated core was modeled in cepheus by @xcite , based on a combination of scuba and akari data , and in that paper we cautioned that temperature gradients could affect the appearance of cores at long wavelengths such as these .",
    "in order to make scuba-2 and _ herschel _ observations comparable , the large - scale structure must be removed from , and the scuba-2 mask must be applied to , the _ herschel _ observations . to this end , the _ herschel _ observations were processed through the scuba-2 pipeline , following the method described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "herschel _ data are scaled such that they represent a small perturbation on the scuba-2 850-  flux densities , and are added to the scuba-2 bolometer time series .",
    "the data reduction process , as described above , is repeated .",
    "the original scuba-2 reduction of the data is then subtracted from the _ herschel _",
    "@xmath3 scuba-2 map , and the scaling applied to the _ herschel _ data is reversed .",
    "this process produces a spatially - filtered and masked version of the original _ herschel _ observations , suitable for comparison with the scuba-2 data .",
    "this process is repeated once for each scuba-2 observing position , for which there were corresponding _ herschel _ data , and the resulting filtered maps combined to form a mosaic .",
    "the effect of the spatial filtering process on the spire 250-  data set is shown in figure  [ fig : unfilt_filt ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : unfilt_filt ] shows the loss of large - scale structure caused by the filtering process .           in figure",
    "[ fig : fakenoise_temp_density ] we plot the temperatures and densities of the filtered-_herschel _",

    "herschel _ data ( i.e. those sources which are listed as counterpart sources in table  [ tab : fakenoise_sources ] ) are highlighted .",
    "it can be seen that those sources detected in the increased - noise filtered _ herschel _ data are preferentially the denser sources .",
    "the mean density of the filtered-_herschel _ sources is @xmath10h@xmath11@xmath12 , while the median density is @xmath13h@xmath11/@xmath14 .",
    "the mean density of the subset of the filtered-_herschel _ sources which are detected in the increased - noise data is @xmath15h@xmath11/@xmath14 , approximately 2.4 times that of the set as a whole , while the median density of the subset detected in the increased - noise data is @xmath16h@xmath11/@xmath14 , approximately 3.5 times that of the whole data set .",
    "moreover , 77percent of the filtered-_herschel _ sources with densities @xmath17h@xmath11/@xmath14 are detected in the increased - noise data , while only 16percent of the filtered-_herschel _ sources with densities @xmath18h@xmath11/@xmath14 are detected .",
    "the clear cutoff in density which is apparent in the detection of scuba-2 850-  sources is less distinct in the increased - noise filtered-_herschel _ data .",
    "this could be due to variation in temperature of the sources , meaning that our choice of increasing the rms noise to a factor of 4.11 times the scuba-2 850-  noise is not representative of all sources .",
    "resolution effects may also contribute to this .",
    "however , these results support our hypothesis that the tendency for scuba-2 850-  emission to detect the only densest sources is due to the decreased surface brightness of sources at 850-  relative to 250- ."
