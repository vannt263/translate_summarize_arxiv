    "celestial mechanics often requires approximation techniques to compute the motion of bodies over very long times .",
    "giving reliable error estimates on these techniques is a very practical problem , of not simple solution .    in this paper",
    "we apply to a typical astronomical problem the general scheme of @xcite @xcite to estimate the error of the averaging principle , in the case of one fast angular variable @xmath3 ( in the one - dimensional torus ) and many slow variables @xmath4 ( the actions ) .",
    "the application we consider refers to the motion of a satellite around an oblate planet : of course , oblateness gives a perturbation of the keplerian , purely radial gravitational potential .",
    "there is a classical way to express the perturbed potential as a series of spherical harmonics , where the multipole moments of the planetary mass distribution appear as coefficients . in the case of axial symmetry , this series only involves zonal harmonics and the @xmath5-th term contains a multipole coefficient @xmath6 ( for a reminder , see subsection and references therein ) . for a slightly oblate planet , all these coefficients",
    "are small if they are defined in a convenient , dimensionless fashion ; often , @xmath7 and one retains only the @xmath8 term of the previous expansion ; the corresponding equations of motion for the satellite are the classical `` @xmath0 problem '' .    in this paper the @xmath0 problem is considered in the restricted case of polar orbits ; this problem involves a fast angular variable @xmath9 ( the angle between the polar axis and the radius vector of the satellite ) and three slow variables @xmath10 representing the parameter , the eccentricity and the argument of the pericenter for the osculating keplerian ellipse . in principle , all these variables are unknown functions of the `` physical '' time @xmath11 ; however , it is customary to consider as a `` time '' variable the angle itself or , rather , the ratio @xmath12 of the angle to @xmath13 . with this choice of the time variable , by definition",
    "the angle evolves with the law @xmath14 $ ] ( where @xmath15 $ ] indicates equivalence mod.@xmath13 ) ; for obvious reasons , @xmath12 will be called the _ orbit counter_. the evolution of @xmath10 is described by a set of equations of the form = f^i(,[2 ] )  , ^i(0 ) = i^i_0  , [ per ] where @xmath16 is a small parameter proportional to @xmath0 ( see again subsection ) . independently of this specific application ,",
    "a system of evolution equations like ( [ per ] ) , with any number of unknown functions @xmath17 and a small parameter @xmath18 , will be called in the sequel a _ perturbed periodic system_. to any such system one can associate an averaged system , replacing the functions @xmath19 in ( [ per ] ) with their averages over the angle @xmath20 $ ] ; the solution @xmath21 of the latter is in a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the difference between the solutions @xmath23 of ( [ per ] ) and @xmath24 of the averaged system , on a time scale of order @xmath25 , can be estimated in a fully quantitative way with the general method of @xcite @xcite ; this is what we are going to do in the present work , for the periodic system describing the polar @xmath0 problem . as in the cited papers",
    ", the expression `` fully quantitative '' means that our final estimate will have the form    @xmath26 are computable functions , and @xmath27 is a constant , whose choice determines quantitatively the interval of observation ; we note that @xmath28 is the total number of orbits .",
    "the availability of an algorithm to construct the estimators @xmath29 is the main difference between the approach of @xcite and the classical , qualitative result @xmath30 , see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "we are aware of the existence of higher order versions of the averaging method , in which the error behaves like @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ; see again @xcite @xcite ) . however , the classical theory of higher order averaging gives little more than the qualitative error estimate @xmath31 ; perhaps an extension of our methods could give quantitative estimators of the form @xmath34 , but this problem is left to future work .",
    "let us return to the functions @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ formm ] ) .",
    "our method to compute them for the @xmath0 problem is mainly analytical , but , in its final steps , it requires the numerical solution of an ode on the interval @xmath35 ; however , this numerical computation is much faster than the direct numerical solution of ( [ per ] ) ( a fact already appearing in other applications , different from the @xmath0 problem , considered in our previous papers ) .    the general treatment proposed in this paper for the polar @xmath0 problem",
    "is subsequently exemplified , choosing for @xmath16 and for the initial conditions @xmath36 the values corresponding to the earth and to the polar and cos - b satellites . in this case , the estimators @xmath29 have been computed up to @xmath37 orbits ( i.e. , one or two centuries ) , spending few seconds of cpu time on a pc . to test their reliability ,",
    "we have computed by direct numerical integration the differences @xmath38 ; this is a more expensive operation , that we have been able to perform up to @xmath39 orbits with the same pc ; our estimators are quite satisfactory on this interval , since the functions @xmath40 are close to the envelopes of the rapidly oscillating functions @xmath41 .    of course",
    ", the treatment of real satellites of the earth should include , besides the @xmath0 gravitational term , other minor perturbations such as : gravitational forces corresponding to higher order moments of the earth , atmospheric dragging , solar wind , tidal effects due to the moon gravity .",
    "all these effects could be treated , giving rise again to a system of the form ( [ per ] ) with more complicated perturbation components @xmath42 ( even for non polar orbits : in general , if the analysis is not restricted to the orbits in a fixed plane , the actions are not three but five ) .",
    "presumably , the corresponding averaged system and our estimators @xmath29 for its error could be computed as well ; this is left to future work . in spite of the limitation to the polar @xmath0 problem",
    ", we think that the results of this paper have some interest , because they show that a general method for error estimates works over very long times on a non - trivial problem .",
    "to conclude , we describe in few words the organization of the paper . in section [ secav ] , we show how to compute the error estimators for the averaging of any periodic system ( [ per ] ) ; this illustration specializes to the periodic case the slightly more general setting of @xcite @xcite for one - frequency systems . in section [ satell ] ,",
