    "[ sec : intro ]    @xcite first discussed multiple regimes of turbulent chemical combustion and gave scaling relations for each . in modern terms , the two regimes can be distinguished by their karlovitz number , ka , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath3 or equivalently , @xmath4 here @xmath0 is the _ rms _ velocity of turbulent fluctuations on an integral scale , @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the laminar conductive speed ; @xmath7 is the width of the laminar flame ; and @xmath8 is the gibson length . for isotropic kolmogorov turbulence ( assumed throughout this paper ) ,",
    "the turbulent speed on the scale of the flame thickness is @xmath9 and the gibson scale , the size of the eddy that turns over in a ( laminar ) flame crossing time , is @xmath10    for ka @xmath11 , individual laminar flames are moved around by the largest turbulent eddies while smaller eddies have little effect .",
    "the overall burning progresses at a speed determined by turbulence properties and is independent of the burning rate on small scales .",
    "this regime has been extensively explored in the astrophysical context @xcite and its properties are reflected in the munich group s subgrid model for flame propagation @xcite .",
    "the condition ka @xmath12 , on the other hand , implies that turbulence can penetrate into the flame and transport heat , and possibly fuel , faster than laminar burning crosses a flame width .",
    "an equivalent condition is that the gibson scale is much less than the flame thickness .",
    "this regime too has been discussed in the astrophysical literature @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that if spontaneous detonation is to occur , it requires ka @xmath13 and probably ka @xmath14 so that the burning region itself is disrupted , not just the preheat zone .",
    "it is also known in the chemical combustion community @xcite that the region ka @xmath12 can be further divided based on the value of the damkhler number , da = @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the characteristic burning time scale , appropriately modified by turbulence . for da @xmath17 1 , the eddy turnover time on the integral scale",
    "is short compared with the nuclear time ; for da @xmath18 1 , it is longer . in the literature ,",
    "the term `` distributed reaction zone(s ) '' has been used with reference to the da @xmath17 1 regime , the da @xmath18 1 regime , or both lumped together ( i.e. , all flames with ka @xmath19 1 ) .",
    "therefore we avoid this terminology , choosing instead to follow @xcite in referring to da @xmath17 1 as the `` well - stirred reactor regime '' ( wsr regime ) , and to follow @xcite in referring to da @xmath18 1 as the `` stirred flame regime '' ( sf regime ) .    in the wsr regime , there is only one flame .",
    "it has a width broader than the integral scale and a speed slower than the turbulent speed on the integral scale .",
    "this sort of flame is similar to the usual laminar flame , except that the turbulent diffusion coefficient ( @xmath20 ) now substitutes for conduction . within the sf regime ,",
    "on the other hand , there can be multiple burning regions , but the idea of a flame brush composed of individual flamelets with well - defined local properties is no longer valid .",
    "the overall burning continues with an average rate given by the turbulent speed on the integral scale , but the flamelets do not have a uniform width and their number and individual speeds are quite variable .    in this paper , we explore these three regimes of turbulent nuclear combustion , ka @xmath21 , wsr , and sf , in the context of a type ia supernova using a numerical tool , the linear eddy model (   [ sec : lem ] ) .",
    "if a transition to detonation is to occur , we conclude that it must happen in the sf regime , specifically where da @xmath22 and in the presence of a high degree of turbulence , @xmath23 .",
    "an example of a successful spontaneous transition to detonation is given .",
    "[ sec : special ]    the conditions characterizing turbulent ( nuclear ) combustion in a type ia supernova are novel and have no direct analogue on earth .",
    "this makes the supernova an interesting environment for testing new physics , but it also means that our terrestrial intuition regarding flames can be misleading . for example , it is thought that laboratory flames in the ka @xmath12 regime simply go out @xcite because they are unable to maintain their heat in the presence of so much turbulence .",
    "but the flame in a supernovae can never `` go out '' until the star comes apart and , in terms , of local flame variables , that takes a very long time .",
    "the relevant time scale is the hydrodynamic time scale for the whole star , @xmath241 s , not the shorter local turbulent time scale , @xmath25 . also the star is very large , @xmath26 laminar flame thicknesses and 100 integral scales .",
    "rare events have many opportunities for realization .",
    "there are also other conditions that are vastly different and , in some cases , make detonation more easily achievable .      the reynolds number in a type ia supernova is orders of magnitude greater than achieved thus far in any terrestrial experiment or in any numerical simulation .",
    "the source of viscosity is electron - ion interactions in a fully ionized plasma @xcite @xmath27 for z = 7 , @xmath28 = 2 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 = 0.5 .",
    "the reynolds number is then @xmath31 for @xmath32 10@xmath33 g @xmath2 , @xmath0 = 100 km s@xmath34 , and @xmath5 = 10 km .",
    "this large value of re implies a tiny kolmogorov scale , much smaller than any laminar flame thickness under consideration here , and irresolvably small in most numerical simulations , @xmath35 note also that this implies ten orders of magnitude in length scale where the turbulence is ( assumed to be ) kolmogorov and isotropic with constant energy dissipation , @xmath36 .    on earth ,",
    "the kolmogorov scale is usually not so small compared with the flame thickness .",
    "this makes achieving the sf and wsr regimes more difficult on earth , though certainly not impossible .",
    "[ sec : cp ]    the heat capacity in the supernova at a relevant density , @xmath37 g @xmath2 , is due to a combination of semi - degenerate electrons , ions and radiation .",
    "radiation is an important component of the heat capacity at these low densities and hence the heat capacity is a rapidly increasing function of the temperature . at a density of @xmath38 g @xmath2 , for 50% c and 50% o ,",
    "the heat capacity at constant pressure is 3.5 , 6.0 , 9.0 , 12.7 , 18.2 , , and 27.3 @xmath39 erg gm@xmath34 k@xmath34 for a temperature of 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 @xmath40 k respectively .",
    "the power of t upon which @xmath41 depends varies from 0.70 to 2.70 in the same temperature range .",
    "this means that when the fuel is cold , a small amount of burning raises the temperature a lot .",
    "given the high power of temperature upon which the burning depends , burning just a little fuel dramatically shortens the nuclear time scale .",
    "[ sec : enuct ]    the most important reaction rate in the regime where detonation might occur is @xmath42c + @xmath42c .",
    "the rate for this reaction is proportional to @xmath43 with @xmath44 for temperatures in the range 1 - 3 @xmath40 k ( more sensitive at lower temperature ) .",
    "this high temperature sensitivity coupled with the temperature - dependent heat capacity means that once about half of the carbon has burned , the remaining increase in the temperature happens very rapidly . as we shall see later this leads to small but very rapid increases in the local pressure that can help initiate a detonation .      as burning plumes of ash float due to the rayleigh - taylor instability , they create shear and turbulence on their boundaries",
    ". since the plumes are large , the speed at which buoyancy balances drag is high .",
    "a speed of order 10 - 30% sonic is necessary to burn a large fraction of the star before it comes apart .",
    "typical turbulent speeds on an integral scale of 10 km are about 150 km s@xmath34 @xcite , but speeds as great as 1000 km s@xmath34 may occasionally occur . the sound speed in the star at a density of 10@xmath33 g @xmath2 is 3500 km s@xmath34 , so the fastest turbulence is not terribly subsonic .",
    "fluctuations in burning rate do not have to accelerate the burning by orders of magnitude in order to make a detonation happen .",
    "[ sec : turb ]    the lewis number , which is the ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity , is very large in the supernova .",
    "the ionic diffusion coefficient for a carbon - oxygen plasma is @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the plasma frequency , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , the ion density , and @xmath49 .",
    "the thermal diffusion coefficient is @xmath50 here representative conditions and opacities have been assumed : @xmath51 k , @xmath52 g @xmath2 , and @xmath53 @xmath54 gm@xmath34 @xcite . combining these two equations , @xmath55 .",
    "terrestrial lewis numbers are close to unity .",
    "the large lewis number in the star has an effect on the laminar speed (   [ sec : laminar ] ) , but this dependence is greatly mitigated in the turbulent regime (   [ sec : distrib ] ) where the turbulent diffusion coefficient exceeds @xmath56 . in that case , the effective lewis number approaches unity since both ions and heat are transported with equal efficiency by the turbulent eddies @xcite .",
    "[ sec : lem ]    the range of scales that must be resolved to address the flame propagation problem in a type ia supernova is very large , @xmath57 cm even if the kolmogorov scale is not resolved .",
    "this range exceeds the current or anticipated capabilities of 3d simulations , or even 2d simulations .",
    "this conundrum arises for many turbulent flow environments , and motivated the development of the linear eddy model ( lem ) , a 1d simulation tool @xcite .",
    "lem simulates the evolution of scalar properties on a 1d spatial domain .",
    "this can be interpreted as property profile evolution along a 1d line of sight through 3d turbulent flow .",
    "the 1d domain is treated as a closed system with respect to enforcement of conservation laws . in this and other respects",
    ", lem is not fully consistent with the evolution observed along a line of sight , yet it captures the salient features and provides useful results .    the physical processes that are time advanced on the lem domain are diffusive ( e.g. , fickian ) transport ( in the present context representing species transport , radiation transport or subgrid turbulent transport ) , chemical ( or nuclear ) reactions , and turbulent eddy motions . for combustion applications , including the present application , lem includes an equation of state , an energy equation , and thermal expansion , using a zero - mach - number ( constant - pressure ) formulation @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the lem approach is the representation of eddy motions .    on a 1d domain ,",
    "advection in the usual sense can not reorder the fluid elements along the domain , hence can not emulate the folding of material surfaces that is an essential feature of turbulent stirring .",
    "a model of eddy motions is introduced that is formulated to capture this folding effect and other properties of turbulent stirring .",
    "namely , a turbulent eddy is represented as an instantaneous map , called the triplet map , that is applied to a designated interval of the 1d domain .",
    "the triplet map is applied by first compressing all property profiles in the interval by a factor of three .",
    "the property profiles in the interval are then replaced by three side - by - side copies ( ` images ' ) of the compressed profiles .",
    "the middle copy is then flipped .",
    "this procedure preserves the continuity of spatial property profiles .",
    "it also leaves the total linear measure ( model analog of volume ) of fluid corresponding to a given state or set of states ( based on the property values ) unchanged .",
    "this is the 1d analog of the solenoidal condition .",
    "flipping of the middle copy introduces fluid - element reordering analogous to the folding of material surfaces .",
    "the three - fold compression emulates gradient amplification by compressive strain .",
    "the dispersive effect of extensive strain is represented in lem by the mapping of neighboring fluid elements to different images .",
    "computationally , the triplet map is implemented as a permutation of the cells of a uniform discretization of the 1d domain .",
    "this and other details of lem are explained elsewhere ( kerstein 1991 ) . here , features relevant to what follows are described .",
    "some symbols that are used have different meanings than in later sections .",
    "an lem simulation time advances processes other than advection until it is time to implement a triplet map .",
    "after the map , advancement of the other processes resumes until it is time for the next map .",
    "model inputs are the initial and boundary conditions , the transport coefficients and rate constants governing diffusive and chemical advancement , and parameters controlling the time sequence of triplet maps .",
    "map size @xmath58 is sampled from a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath59 that is designed to reproduce relevant features of the inertial - range turbulent cascade .",
    "one key feature is the turbulent diffusivity @xmath60 associated with maps of size @xmath61 .",
    "the inertial - range scaling @xmath62 is enforced . in @xcite , it is shown that this implies @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a normalization factor .",
    "map size @xmath58 is restricted to the range @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 and @xmath5 are the model analogs of the kolmogorov scale and the integral scale , respectively .",
    "then as shown in the appendix , the total turbulent diffusivity is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total frequency of maps of all sizes per unit domain length . here",
    ", homogeneous turbulence is assumed , so none of the model parameters depend on location , and map location is sampled uniformly within the notionally infinite 1d domain .",
    "the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath5 , and @xmath60 are model inputs and @xmath68 is determined from them .",
    "@xmath60 is not typically known for turbulent flows , but rather is inferred from the relation @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is an empirical coefficient . here ,",
    "lem results are compared to 3d simulations of turbulent premixed combustion for which @xmath0 and @xmath5 are known , but @xmath60 is not , so @xmath70 must be specified in order to evaluate the lem input parameter @xmath60 . @xcite",
    "calibrated @xmath70 by comparing lem results for turbulent premixed methane - air combustion ( using a simplified chemical mechanism ) to turbulent burning velocity measurements .",
    "they chose the value @xmath71 for some cases and @xmath72 for others , reflecting the wide variation of turbulent burning velocity results obtained in different experiments .",
    "the experimental set - ups did not correspond to the idealized case of flames freely propagating through stationary , homogeneous turbulence . here",
    ", lem results are compared to 3d simulation results more closely analogous to the lem flow configuration .",
    "the @xmath70 value inferred from this comparison is close to the lower of the two @xmath70 values reported by smith and menon .",
    "[ sec : modifications ]    the standard ( i.e. , terrestrial chemical combustion ) version of lem was modified to use an equation of state , opacities , and a nuclear reaction network appropriate to the supernova .",
    "the equation of state ( the  helmholtz eos ",
    "* ) included pressure and energy contributions from radiation , ions ( treated as an ideal gas ) , and electrons and pairs of arbitrary speed and degeneracy .",
    "the opacity routine @xcite included heat transport by radiative diffusion and conduction .",
    "energy generation and composition changes were followed using a nuclear reaction network with 7 species : @xmath73he , @xmath42c , @xmath74o , @xmath75ne , @xmath76 mg , @xmath77si , and @xmath78ni ( though no appreciable @xmath78ni was ever produced in this study ) .",
    "these species were connected together by a chain of @xmath79 reactions as well as the heavy ion reactions 3@xmath80 , @xmath42c + @xmath42c , @xmath74o + @xmath74o , and @xmath42c + @xmath74o . though it is an unpublished version written by the authors , the network was similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the network did not include electron screening corrections to the reaction rates which were , in general , small at the low densities considered here .",
    "testing the fast 7 isotope network against a larger 19 isotope network that included screening and about 85 reactions @xcite showed that the small network gave an energy generation that was typically 20 - 40% smaller . since this is equivalent to a small error in the temperature , the results of the 7 isotope , unscreened network were deemed sufficiently accurate .",
    "the code was then checked and calibrated against several other studies of flame propagation . for simple laminar flames (   [ sec : laminar ] ) , the turbulence parameter , @xmath70 (   [ sec : lem ] ) , does nt enter .",
    "for turbulent flames in the flamelet regime , the default setting @xmath81 was used (   [ sec : flamelet ] ) . however , for flames in the wsr regime (   [ sec : distrib ] ) , good agreement with prior 3d studies required a smaller value of @xmath82 .",
    "this value is within the range anticipated from terrestrial experiments (   [ sec : lem ] ) and was used for all calculations in the wsr and sf regimes ( i.e. , all studies with ka @xmath83 ) unless otherwise noted .",
    "future 3d studies , especially of the sf regime , are encouraged in order to gain better confidence and understanding of @xmath70 for flames of this sort .",
    "[ sec : laminar ]    in the absence of turbulence , a flame has a simple structure in which a self - similar profile of temperature and fuel concentration propagates into the fuel with a well - defined width and speed .",

    "a recalculation of the flame speed with coarser grids gave essentially the same answer .",
    "for resolutions of 0.196 cm and 0.0978 cm the calculated flame speed was 3.2 and 3.1 @xmath87 cm s@xmath34 , respectively , indicating that our calculation and that of @xcite were both converged and did not differ because of resolution .",
    "some dependence on lewis number was noted .",
    "two calculations of the speed for @xmath84 = 0.50 and le = 100 and le = 1000 gave speeds of @xmath88 cm s@xmath34 and @xmath89 cm s@xmath34 respectively .",

    "because these speeds are so much greater than the laminar speed ( table 1 ) , especially at low density , it is expected that turbulence has a major effect on flame propagation .",
    "initially , however , the flame is very thin compared to the gibson length and is just carried around by the eddies @xcite .",
    "overall the burning rate is independent of the speed of each little flamelet , and is governed instead by the speed of the largest turbulent eddies .",

    "however , detonation does not happen so early because the turbulent speed then is very subsonic and the individual flamelets are thin .",
    "later , the number of flamelets becomes very large , reaching hundreds or even thousands , and variations in the overall burning rate are much smaller .",
    "detonation remains impossible in the flamelet regime .",
    "no critical mass of hot fuel can be obtained .",
    "as the karlovitz number increases above about 10 , hot ash and cold fuel can be mixed for the first time and detonation is , in principle , possible .",
    "two cases of turbulent burning were explored corresponding to the well - stirred reactor ( wsr ; da @xmath21 , ",
    "[ sec : distrib ] ) and stirred flames ( sf ; da @xmath13 ;   [ sec : stirred ] ) . in the wsr regime , turbulent diffusion substitutes for heat diffusion and turbulently broadened flames result .",
    "these flames can be much larger than the integral scale . because the integral scale in a supernova is so large , this limiting case",
    "is probably never fully realized , but is amenable to numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "we normalized an uncertain constant in the lem calculation , @xmath70 , (   [ sec : lem ] ) to those simulations . in the stirred flame regime ,",
    "one again has something like a flame brush , but with turbulently broadened structures substituting for the individual flamelets in the flamelet regime .",
    "the structure of burning here is complex and highly variable . because the burning time scale is very temperature sensitive , it is possible to mix large regions of `` warm '' fuel and ash in which are embedded smaller nuggets on the verge of explosion .",
    "mixed regions of nearly constant temperature are sometimes observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : andy5 ] ,   [ sec : ledges ] ) .",
    "spontaneous detonation can happen in the sf regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detonation ] , ",
    "[ sec : itworks ] ) .",
    "it does not require complete mixing on the integral scale , and hence da @xmath188 as discussed in @xcite , but is favored by values of da that are not large .",
    "the necessary conditions occur infrequently and require a favorable confluence of several mixed regions including : a ) some region , perhaps not large and with a low mass fraction of carbon , where the burning occurs sufficiently rapidly to increase the pressure by a small fraction supersonically ; and b ) an extended region where the carbon mass fraction rises gradually and the temperature falls slowly .",
    "neither region need be particularly homogeneous as long as some part of the composition burns supersonically for condition a ) and there are neither large barriers of ash or abrupt , sustained increases in carbon mass fraction for condition b ) .    in general ,",
    "the production of these situations require turbulent speeds that are already a considerable fraction of sonic , certainly within 10% and probably 20% .",
    "overall the progress of burning in the sf regime varies frequently by a factor of three up and down , and rare excursions to larger values probably also occur due to intermittency @xcite .",
    "we also find that appreciable turbulence can be put into the burning region on a scale comparable to the integral scale by small subsonic explosions of mixtures that fail to detonate (   [ sec : atc ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] ) . before the big bang in these stars",
    ", there is a lot of thunder . though we have not demonstrated it here , we speculate that this energy input may exceed that put in at the large scale by the flame instabilities . if so , there is the possibility of a turbulent runaway in which mixing pumps energy into turbulence which in turn causes accelerated mixing @xcite",
    ". the endpoint would be detonation .",
    "these necessary conditions for detonation are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : darm ] .",
    "detonation is estimated to occur for a reasonable range of turbulent energies in the nearly horizontal band between the lines da = 10 and da = 100 .",
    "it must be acknowledged that this figure is very approximate because the nuclear time scale ( and hence damkhler number ) are poorly determined .",
    "the effective nuclear time scale in da is probably longer than in table 3 and intermittency essentially raises the effective turbulent speed making detonation possible at a higher density .",
    "this is why the conditions da = 10 - 100 in fig .",
    "[ fig : darm ] are probably more favored than say 1 to 10 . above da = 100",
    ", the mixed regions may be too small to initiate a detonation .",
    "three - dimensional simulations by @xcite show that the necessary degree of turbulence for detonation , roughly @xmath189 = 500 km s@xmath34 , is realized in the full star models .",
    "we also find some dependence of the detonation conditions on initial carbon mass fraction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for lower carbon mass fractions ,",
    "damkhler numbers of order 10 are reached at a higher density .",
    "if detonation does occur at a higher density , the explosion makes more @xmath78ni and a brighter supernova .",
    "however , detonation depends on achieving a significant overpressure on a sonic time scale . by the time that carbon - poor fuel carbon reaches a temperature where it burns rapidly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taunuc ] ) , the remaining burning produces too small an overpressure .",
    "detonating carbon - rich fuel is , in this sense , easier ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note that the relevant location for detonation is probably in the outer layers where the density first declines below 10@xmath33 g cm@xmath34 at the flame front , not near the center .",
    "the carbon abundance is higher in these outer layers .",
    "all in all , our results are supportive of the hypothesis that some , perhaps even all chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs explode by a delayed detonation that occurs shortly after the burning enters the sf regime .",
    "this would then make the location and number of detonation points , along with the ignition conditions @xcite , the principal determining factors in the intrinsic properties of a type ia supernova .",
    "several avenues for future investigation are opened up by this work .",
    "first , our results hinge on the calibration of the 1d lem model to direct 3d simulation @xcite .",
    "the 3d study used for normalization here was carried out in the wsr regime , but the results ( e.g. , the constant c ) were assumed to be valid in the sf regime . given the subgrid model developed here , it should be possible to carry out equivalent 3d studies for the sf regime ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the results for detonation (   [ sec : itworks ] ) and active turbulent combustion (   [ sec : atc ] ) were obtained by mapping results from lem using a linear grid into a 1d compressible hydro - code with spherical coordinates .",
    "it would be greatly preferable to see both the mixing and the strong pressure waves in the same , preferably 3d study .",
    "because of the range in length scales , the need for a large effective reynolds number , and the rare , transient nature of the phenomena , this will require a very major investment of computational resources , but should be practical in the near future .",
    "ultimately , of course , one would want to see these results applied to full scale models of the supernova and its light curve .",
