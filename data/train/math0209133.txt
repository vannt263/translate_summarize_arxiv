    "then these connections have been studied by several authors and other similar correspondences have been discovered @xcite .    roughly speaking the principle is the following : the basis of simple modules in the grothendieck group of some appropriate category of representations of a certain algebra *",
    "a * ( a hecke algebra of type @xmath10 or @xmath11 , an ariki - koike algebra , a @xmath7-schur algebra , @xmath12 ) can be identified with the specialization at @xmath13 of the dual canonical basis of ( a representation of ) a certain quantum enveloping algebra * u*.    let @xmath4 be a complex simple lie algebra and @xmath14 its maximal nilpotent subalgebra . in this paper",
    "we show that even when there is no apparent connection with the grothendieck group of some category , the dual canonical basis @xmath2 of @xmath0 exhibits some features resembling certain classical properties of the irreducible characters in lie theory .    in order to observe this",
    ", one has to study @xmath2 in the particular realization of @xmath0 discovered by rosso @xcite and green @xcite in terms of quantum shuffles .",
    "when @xmath4 is of type @xmath5 , the embedding @xmath3 of @xmath0 in the quantum shuffle algebra @xmath15 is precisely a @xmath7-analogue of the map @xmath16",
    "\\mapsto \\ch m$ ] from the zelevinsky ring of a category of representations of the affine hecke algebras of type @xmath8 to the corresponding character ring .",
    "indeed , as shown in @xcite , the multiplication of characters coming from parabolic induction of hecke modules is given by the ( classical ) shuffle product .",
    "moreover , the above principle states in this case that the basis @xmath2 is a @xmath7-analogue of the basis of the zelevinsky ring consisting of the classes of simple modules , hence @xmath6 may be regarded as a @xmath7-analogue of the set of irreducible characters ( see section  [ sect4 ] below for more details ) .",
    "this motivates our investigation of @xmath6 for general @xmath4 .",
    "we shall be concerned with three main properties .",
    "first , it is easy to describe explicitly the image @xmath17 of the embedding of @xmath0 in the quantum shuffle algebra ( theorem  [ th2 ] ) .",
    "we think of this result as an analogue of the classical fact that the characters of the ( virtual ) integrable @xmath4-modules are the polynomials invariant under the action of the weyl group .",
    "secondly , we show that the elements of @xmath6 are parametrized by their maximal word for the lexicographic order ( theorem  [ th7 ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the parametrization of irreducible integrable @xmath4-modules by their highest weight .",
    "thirdly , it follows from lusztig s geometric construction of the canonical bases that for @xmath4 of simply laced type , the coefficients of the elements of @xmath6 belong to @xmath18 $ ] ( theorem  [ positive ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that this positivity property is also true in the non - simply laced case .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that the character of a @xmath4-module is a positive sum of weights .    as an application",
    ", we describe in section  [ algo1 ] an algorithm for calculating the basis @xmath2 , which allowed us to discover examples of imaginary vectors of @xmath2 for @xmath4 of type @xmath19 , thus disproving a conjecture of berenstein and zelevinsky for all types except @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "there are some formal similarities between our results and the theory of @xmath7-characters for finite - dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras developed by frenkel - reshetikhin @xcite , frenkel - mukhin @xcite and nakajima @xcite .",
    "actually , in type @xmath5 , our @xmath7-characters for affine hecke algebras are interpreted geometrically in terms of the same graded quiver varieties as those used by nakajima for defining the @xmath22-characters of @xmath23 @xcite , so both families of characters contain essentially the same information . for other types",
    "though , there is no clear relationship between @xmath6 and the @xmath7-characters of @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sect1 ] , we review , following rosso and green , the construction of the quantum shuffle embedding of @xmath0 . our presentation is based on the @xmath7-derivations @xmath25 of kashiwara , which in the type @xmath10 case have the natural interpretation of @xmath26-restriction operators in terms of affine hecke algebras . then we prove theorem  [ th2 ] . we also describe explicitly the embedding of the algebra of regular functions @xmath27 $ ] in the ( classical ) shuffle algebra obtained by specializing at @xmath13 the embedding @xmath3 ( here @xmath28 stands for a maximal unipotent subgroup of a complex simple lie group @xmath29 with lie algebra @xmath4 ) .",
    "sections  [ sect2 ] and [ sect2bis ] are devoted to certain monomial bases and pbw - type bases , respectively , which play an essential role in the proofs of our results on @xmath2 .",
    "these two sections are based on some beautiful theorems of lalonde and ram @xcite and rosso  @xcite . in particular , lalonde and ram",

    "these so - called ` good lyndon words ' and their nonincreasing products label in a natural way certain monomial and lyndon bases . for the convenience of the reader ,",
    "we have included proofs of most of the statements of @xcite needed for our purposes .",
    "the main new result ( theorem  [ theomax ] ) describes the maximal words of the images under @xmath3 of the elements of certain lusztig s pbw - type bases .",
    "it is obtained by relating lusztig s pbw - bases to rosso s lyndon bases . in section  [ sect3 ]",

    "finally , section  [ sect6 ] describes a family of root vectors of @xmath2 for classical and simply - laced types .",
