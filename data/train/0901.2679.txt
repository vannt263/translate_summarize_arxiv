    "we use their work , together with some results from @xcite , to show that the number of lattice points corresponding to elements in the ball of radius @xmath0 is asymptotically the same as the total number of lattice points in the ball of radius @xmath0 .",

    "the space @xmath17 has a canonical measure , known as the masur - veech measure , which we shall denote @xmath21 , and we will write @xmath22 for the conditional measure on @xmath20 induced by @xmath21 . we may think of @xmath20 as the ( co-)tangent space at @xmath7 .",

    "then @xmath36    this shows that elements are `` generic '' in the , at least for one particular definition of generic , see farb @xcite for a discussion of similar questions . in the case",
    "in which @xmath1 consists of the non - elements of the , this result should also follow from the methods of eskin and mirzakhani @xcite , which they use to show that the number of conjugacy classes of elements of translation length at most @xmath0 on space is asymptotic to @xmath37 . in the sporadic cases , the mapping class group is either finite , or already well understood , as the mapping class group is @xmath38 , up to finite index .",
    "in the remainder of this section we give a brief outline of the argument . in section [ section : geodesic flow ]",
    "we describe the results we need from @xcite and set up some notation . in section [ section :",
    "limit sets ] we review some useful properties of the visual boundary of space , and then in section [ section : asymptotics ] we prove the main result .",

    "we wish to consider the distribution of elements of @xmath15 inside space @xmath39 . in some parts of @xmath39 elements of @xmath15",
    "are close together , and in other parts elements of @xmath15 are widely separated .",
    "we quantify this by by defining @xmath40 to be the @xmath41-dense elements of @xmath15 , namely those elements of @xmath15 which are distance at most @xmath41 in the metric from some other element of @xmath1 .",
    "if two lattice points @xmath25 and @xmath42 are a bounded distance apart , then @xmath43 and @xmath44 are a bounded distance apart in the word metric on @xmath4 . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the limit set of the @xmath41-dense elements in the word metric has measure zero in the gromov boundary of the relative space , and we use this to show that the @xmath41-dense elements in space have a limit set in the visual boundary @xmath20 which has @xmath22-measure zero .",
    "a straightforward application of the results of @xcite then shows that the proportion of lattice points @xmath45 which lie in @xmath46 tends to zero as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",

    "we say a subset of @xmath39 is @xmath41-separated , if any two elements of the set are distance at least @xmath41 apart , so @xmath49 is a @xmath41-separated subset of @xmath39 .",
    "naively , one might hope that the proportion of @xmath41-separated elements of @xmath2 in @xmath6 is at most @xmath50 , as each lattice point @xmath51 is contained in a ball of radius @xmath41 in space containing @xmath52 other lattice points , none of which lie in @xmath48 .",
    "such a bound would imply the required result , as this would give a collection of upper bounds for @xmath53 which depend on @xmath41 , and furthermore these upper bounds would decay exponentially in @xmath41 , so this implies that the limit above is zero .",

    "if a lattice point @xmath25 is within distance @xmath41 of @xmath55 , then many of the lattice points in @xmath56 may lie outside @xmath6 , and a definite proportion of lattice points are close to the boundary , as the volume of @xmath6 grows exponentially .",
    "we use the mixing property of the geodesic flow to show that that @xmath55 becomes equidistributed on compact sets of the quotient space @xmath57 , and this in turn shows that the intersections of @xmath55 with @xmath58 are evenly distributed .",
    "this implies that we can find an upper bound for the average number of lattice points of @xmath2 near some @xmath59 close to the boundary , which do in fact lie inside @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , we prove a result that works for bisectors , so we also need to show that the proportion of lattice points near the geodesics rays through @xmath60 tends to zero as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "these arguments using mixing originate in work of margulis @xcite , and our treatment of conditional mixing is essentially due to eskin and mcmullen @xcite , see also gorodnik and oh @xcite , for the higher rank case .",

    "in this section we review the work of athreya , bufetov , eskin and mirzakhani @xcite that we will use , fix notation , and use the mixing property of the geodesic flow to show a conditional mixing result , which is an analogue in space of a result of eskin and mcmullen @xcite in the case of lie groups .",
