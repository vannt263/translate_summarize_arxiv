    "<S> these observations are actually valid for one - patch contributions from non - planar diagrams , too . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one - patch corrections do not change the one - loop fixed point structure at any finite order .    </S>",
    "<S> the feynman diagrams contain _ fermion loops _ which are connected by boson lines . </S>",
    "<S> feynman diagrams for the fermionic self - energy and the fermion - boson vertex contain also an open fermion line , but at least one fermion loop is required to have fermions on both patches mixed in one diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we denote a fermion loop with @xmath53 vertices by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the patch index and @xmath56 are the bosonic momenta injected at the vertices . </S>",

    "<S> the feynman diagrams can be grouped in distinct classes by writing them in terms of symmetrized loops . </S>",
    "<S> two diagrams within a class are related by a permutation of boson vertices attached to a fermion loop . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fourclasses ] are related by such a permutation . from diagram </S>",

    "<S> cancellations of divergences may occur between feynman diagrams within a class defined by symmetrized loops . </S>",
    "<S> for bare fermion propagators substantial generic cancellations of infrared divergences upon symmetrization of a single fermion loop where found already long ago @xcite . however , the symmetrized loop remains singular in the very special infrared limit eq .  </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , there is no reason to expect systematic cancellations between diagrams not belonging to the same symmetrized loop class . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the relative sign of contributions from different classes depends on the signs of the fermion - boson vertices . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the product of couplings @xmath58 in the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .  [ fig : fourclasses ] yields a minus sign in case of the u(1)-gauge theory , if the loops are on distinct patches , but a plus sign for the nematic qcp , while the product of couplings in diagrams of type ( e ) is always positive . </S>",
    "<S> hence , even if a cancellation occured between distinct classes for one theory , it would not occur for the other .    </S>",
    "<S> the issue is thus under which circumstances and to what extent cancellations suppress symmetrized fermion loops in the ultraviolet limit . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for @xmath54 constructed with rpa propagators are presented in the supplementary materials  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , the 3-point loop is thus expected to become scale invariant for large @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the 3-point loop entering the aslamasov - larkin - type contribution to the boson self - energy actually behaves differently . since the external momentum @xmath64 of the boson self - energy stays fixed , the uv limit has to be taken only at the vertices of the loop connected to internal boson lines . </S>",
    "<S> a large momentum is injected at one of the vertices and pulled out again at a neighboring vertex . from the explicit expression for the 3-point loop it is easy to see that @xmath65 decays as @xmath66 for large @xmath67 and fixed @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath68 is constrained to the size of @xmath69 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the symmetrized aslamasov - larkin diagram is finite in the uv limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the symmetrized 3-point loop with @xmath66 is a consequence of the symmetrization , while the kinematic constraint of @xmath68 is present already in the unsymmetrized function @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> the gain of a power in @xmath66 for a symmetrized loop with a fixed external momentum holds generally . in the supplementary materials  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we show that @xmath57 vanishes if one of the momenta @xmath71 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the symmetrized loop decays at least as @xmath72 if one momentum stays fixed while the others tend to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> if a fixed momentum @xmath64 is injected at a vertex and extracted at another vertex of the same loop , while all other external momenta become large ( this is possible only for @xmath73 ) , there is even a suppression of order @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this gain in power - counting from symmetrization guarantees that contributions to the boson self - energy diverge at most logarithmically , with a prefactor of the order @xmath75 for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> quadratic and linear uv divergences of the boson self - energy indicated by power - counting must cancel . </S>",
    "<S> the same conclusion can be drawn from a ward identity following from current conservation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the kinematic constraint suppressing the 3-point loop in the aslamasov - larkin diagram is more special . </S>",
    "<S> it does hold for @xmath53-point loops with general @xmath53 , too , but only in case that only _ </S>",

    "<S> the vertex corrections contained as subdiagrams in those diagrams include a 4-point loop with a fixed external boson momentum . the symmetrized vertex correction obtained by summing all permutations of boson vertices at the loop is thus finite due to the cancellations under symmetrization discussed above . </S>",
