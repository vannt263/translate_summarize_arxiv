    "the bfkl equation  @xcite is widely discussed now , because it can enlighten an important question of elementary particle physics such as the theoretical description of qcd semi - hard processes .",
    "it gets a special importance due to the present experimental investigation of the deep inelastic electron - proton scattering at hera ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) in the region of small values of the bjorken variable @xmath9 .",
    "this equation was derived more than twenty years ago in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla )  @xcite , where all the terms of the type @xmath10 are summed up .",
    "recently , the radiative corrections to the equation were calculated  @xcite-@xcite and the explicit form of the kernel of the equation in the next - to - leading approximation ( nla ) became known  @xcite for the case of forward scattering .",
    "the large size of the corrections induced a number of subsequent publications ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .    in the bfkl approach",
    "the high energy scattering amplitudes are given as the convolution ( see eq.([ar ] ) below ) of the green function for two interacting reggeized gluons with the impact factors of the colliding particles  @xcite .",
    "while the green function is determined by the kernel of the bfkl equation , the impact factors must be evaluated separately . in some cases such as , for instance ,",
    "the impact factors of strongly - virtual photons or hard mesons , this can be done in perturbation theory , while in the general non - perturbative case there is need of new ideas for the evaluation .",
    "this paper is devoted to the calculation of the nla non - forward gluon impact factors with arbitrary color state in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "although they are not directly connected with observable cross sections , their knowledge is very important for the bfkl theory for two reasons .",
    "firstly , these impact factors can be used for the nla calculation of scattering amplitudes of partons in the bfkl approach .",
    "the second reason , on which we mainly concentrate here , is the necessity to check the so - called `` bootstrap '' conditions  @xcite .",
    "the matter is the following : the base of the bfkl equation approach is the property of the `` gluon reggeization '' , whose exact meaning was explained in details in ref .",
    "this property was proved only in the lla  @xcite , while beyond the lla it was checked only in the first three orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "the `` bootstrap '' conditions , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , are just appealed to demonstrate the self - consistency of the bfkl approach in the nla , although ( if satisfied ) they can not be considered a proof of the reggeization in a mathematical sense .",
    "the fulfillment of these conditions , however , would confirm so strongly the reggeization that there would be no doubts that it is correct .",
    "moreover , the check of the `` bootstrap '' equations is extremely important since they involve almost all the values appearing in the nla bfkl kernel , so that the check provides a global test of the calculations  @xcite-@xcite of the nla corrections , which only in a small part were independently performed  @xcite or checked  @xcite .",
    "the first bootstrap equation derived in  @xcite connects the kernel of the non - forward bfkl equation for the color octet in the @xmath0-channel with the gluon trajectory . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this equation is satisfied in the part concerning the quark contribution for arbitrary space - time dimension .",
    "the second bootstrap condition involves the impact factors of the scattered particles with color octet in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "the case of colliding gluons is the object of the present paper , while quarks have been considered in a related paper  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we explain the method of calculation , sections  3 , 4 and 5 are devoted to the calculation of one - gluon , quark - antiquark and two - gluon contributions to the gluon impact factors , respectively , for arbitrary color group representation in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "section  6 contains details of the check of the second bootstrap condition , which involves the octet gluon impact factors in the nla .",
    "the nla gluon impact factors for the case of qcd with massless quark flavors are considered in the section  7 .",
    "the results obtained are briefly discussed in section  8 .",
    "some integrations are carried out in the appendix  a.",
    "let us remind that the impact factors were introduced in the bfkl approach for the description of the elastic scattering amplitudes @xmath11 in the regge kinematical region @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the momenta of the initial and final particles , respectively .",
    "we use for all vectors the sudakov decomposition @xmath15 the vectors @xmath16 being the light - cone basis of the initial particle momenta plane @xmath17 , so that we can put @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the masses of the colliding particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the vector notation is used throughout this paper for the transverse components of the momenta , since all vectors in the transverse subspace are evidently space - like .",
    "the basis of the bfkl approach is the gluon reggeization . in the case of the elastic scattering ,",
    "it means that the amplitude with gluon quantum numbers and negative signature in the @xmath0-channel has the regge form @xmath23 \\gamma _ { b^{\\prime } b\\mbox { \\ \\ } } ^{c } .",
