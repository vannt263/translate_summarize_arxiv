    "in this paper , we present a theory of ferroelectricity originating from an electronic phase transition , in contrast to the conventional displacive ferroelectricity due to a lattice distortion  @xcite .",
    "the electronic ferroelectricity occurs in a strongly correlated electron system , namely , the insulating phase of the falicov - kimball model .    the falicov - kimball ( fk ) model was introduced originally  @xcite as a simple model to explain the metal - insulator transitions observed in certain transition - metal and rare - earth compounds .",
    "the model has since been applied extensively to the mixed - valent compounds and heavy - fermion materials .",
    "the fk model introduces two types of electrons : itinerant @xmath0-electrons and localized @xmath1-electrons .",
    "the valence transition is driven by the on - site coulomb repulsion between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-electrons .",
    "a @xmath0-@xmath1 hybridization term may or may not be added to the model .",
    "the theoretical solutions for the ground state of the fk model can be divided into two classes . on the one hand , solutions with @xmath1-occupation as a good quantum number  @xcite",
    "do not have a built - in coherence between @xmath0-electrons and @xmath1-holes . on the other hand , solutions such as the self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) solution  @xcite and the electronic polaron  @xcite do have a built - in coherence between @xmath0-electrons and @xmath1-holes .",
    "the built - in coherence of the scmf solution breaks the inversion symmetry of the fk hamiltonian in the following way .",
    "the many - electron eigenstates of the hamiltonian can be classified into even and odd parity states .",
    "the scmf ground states with even and odd parities are degenerate .",
    "a linear combination of the even and odd parity states forms the appropriate ground state for the limit of a vanishing electric field .",
    "we shall argue that such degenerate ground states can exist for solutions with @xmath1-occupation as a good quantum number .",
    "thus , the inversion symmetry breaking is not limited to the scmf solution .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper  @xcite is to give a detailed account of the linear and nonlinear optical characteristics of the scmf solution .",
    "the inversion - symmetry - broken ground state possesses the following distinctive properties : ( 1 ) electronic ferroelectricity , ( 2 ) ferroelectric resonance , and ( 3 ) a nonvanishing susceptibility for second - harmonic generation .",
    "solutions of the model without built - in coherence do not have these properties . as experimental tests to distinguish between the two classes of solutions we propose measurements of the static dielectric constant , the microwave absorption spectrum , and the dynamic second - order susceptibility of a mixed - valent compound , for example @xmath2 .    in recent years ,",
    "four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying coherence in optically pumped semiconductor systems  @xcite . in a three - beam fwm experiment ,",
    "two incoming beams of wavevectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 set up a transient polarization grating . a third incoming beam of wavevector @xmath5 diffracts off this grating to produce an outgoing signal in the direction @xmath6 .",
    "being a third - order process , fwm is allowed in media with or without inversion symmetry .",
    "we pose the question : what happens if the system being probed already has a polarization built into it by nature ?",
    "an example of such a system is the scmf solution of the fk model resulting in the bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0-@xmath1 excitons .",
    "as shown below , the built - in polarization leads to a nonlinear optical response to _ second _ order in the external field .",
    "the mixed - valent system has a nonvanishing susceptibility @xmath7 for second - harmonic generation .",
    "the built - in polarization replaces one of the incoming beams of the three - beam fwm experiment . in crystals with inversion symmetry",
    ", second - harmonic generation is forbidden in the electric - dipole approximation . in the mixed - valent system",
    "the built - in polarization breaks the inversion symmetry , allowing second - harmonic generation to take place .",
    "we present a calculation of the second - harmonic susceptibility of a model mixed - valent system within the scmf approximation .",
    "the second - harmonic susceptibility is directly proportional to the built - in coherence @xmath8 , showing that second - harmonic generation can be used as a test of @xmath0-@xmath1 exciton condensation in mixed - valent compounds .",
    "the existence of a built - in polarization in the ground state also means that , according to the scmf theory , mixed - valent compounds are ferroelectric . whereas in commonly known ferroelectrics the built - in polarization is due to the relative displacement of positive and negative ions , the ferroelectricity in mixed - valent compounds is of purely electronic origin .",
    "apart from possible jahn - teller distortions as a result of the electronic polarization , the valence transition does not involve a change in the crystal structure .",
    "as shown below , the valence transition is accompanied by a divergence of the static dielectric constant at the critical value of the @xmath1-level energy .",
    "the divergence of the static dielectric constant should be observable in real mixed - valent compounds , for example by varying the external pressure or temperature .",
    "the continuous symmetry associated with the phase of @xmath8 leads to a goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum of the mixed - valent compound . in the pseudo - spin picture",
    ", the goldstone mode corresponds to a uniform precession of the pseudo - spins around the @xmath9-axis .",
    "ferroelectric resonance occurs when an ac electric field is applied whose frequency coincides with that of the goldstone mode .",
    "this phenomenon is the electric analogue of magnetic resonance in ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the ferroelectric resonance frequency is proportional to the square root of the effective bias field , and may depend on the sample shape , domain structure , and crystal fields . in real mixed - valent compounds , ferroelectric resonance should occur in the microwave regime .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we discuss the scmf solution for the ground state of the fk model .",
    "we show that the scmf ground state has a built - in polarization which breaks the inversion symmetry of the fk hamiltonian .",

    "we obtain an analytical expression for the linear susceptibility in a uniform static electric field .",
    "we determine the ferroelectric resonance frequency and analyze the shape of the infrared absorption spectrum . in section  [ sec : chitwo ] we compute the second - harmonic susceptibility of the model system . in section  [ sec : experiment ] we compare the results of the model calculation to experimental data and propose experimental tests of coherence in real mixed - valent compounds . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the possibility of ferroelectricity , ferroelectric resonance , and second - harmonic generation for solutions of the fk model _ other _ than the scmf solution .",

    "the scmf solution is analogous to the bcs theory of superconductivity except that the pairing now occurs between a @xmath0-electron of momentum @xmath12 and an @xmath1-hole of momentum @xmath21 ( ref .  ) . whereas a cooper pair carries charge ,",
    "an electron - hole pair is neutral .",
    "the scmf solution therefore describes an insulator , rather than a superconductor .",
    "pairing between electrons and holes may also occur in a semiconductor placed in an intense coherent laser field  @xcite . in that case , the pairing is externally enforced by the pump field .",
    "the mean - field decoupling of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : fkh ] ) yields the effective one - particle hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gap parameter , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-level occupancies respectively .",

    "the key feature of the scmf ground state @xmath53 is that it breaks the inversion symmetry of the fk hamiltonian . in general ,",
