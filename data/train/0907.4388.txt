    "therefore , geometrical quantities as the volume of a region or the area of a surface can be written in terms of the electric field . in loop quantum gravity",
    "these quantities correspond to operators having discrete spectra and eigenstates given by spin network states @xcite .",
    "the area and the volume operator provide an interpretation of spin network states in terms of quantum geometries : quanta of volume are associated to regions dual to nodes of the spin network graph , and quanta of area are associated to surfaces dual to links of the graph . within the setting described in this paper , a cellular decomposition is present from the very beginning and a spin network with graph dual to it arises as the appropriate tool to describe gauge- and diffeomorphism - invariant functionals of the connection",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if , in this setting , operators build out of the flux of the electric field can attach a geometric meaning to the cells of the decomposition .",
    "this perspective was first proposed in @xcite and is currently under study .",
    "we point out some key differences between the spin network states discussed in this paper and the ones used in ordinary loop quantum gravity . in loop quantum gravity ,",
    "embedded spin networks are not diffeomorphism invariant . in fact , states with diffeomorphic graphs which do not coincide are orthogonal . however , once the diffeomorphism constraint is imposed , most of these states are identified : abstract spin networks ( also called s - knots ) actually depend only on the diffeomorphism equivalence class of the graph and on the @xmath27 labels attached to it .",
    "the diffeomorphism equivalence class of graphs knows about the connectivity of the graph , about its knotting with the non - trivial topology of the manifold , about the self - knotting of the graph , and about some continuous parameters ( moduli ) related to the tangents to the links at each node of the graph @xcite .",
    "these continuous parameters are due to the assumed differentiable structure at the nodes and disappear if a larger class of diffeomorphisms ( the so called @xmath170 ) is considered @xcite . on the other hand , the spin networks considered in our analysis arise as a tool for describing functions on the moduli space of locally - flat connections . as a result ,",
    "even if the graph of our spin networks is embedded , the state they define is actually diffeomorphism - invariant .",
    "moreover , they do not depend on the self - knotting of their graph , nor on the continuous moduli associated to the differentiable structure at the nodes .",
    "the only thing they actually depend on is their knotting with the manifold @xmath10 , i.e. with the network of defects and with the topology of the original manifold @xmath3 . from this point of view , they are closer to the use that is made of spin networks as boundary states within the context of spin foams .",
    "this fact leads us to the next two points .    * _ dynamics and spin foams_. the construction discussed is purely kinematical .",
    "a natural tool for implementing its dynamics is provided by spin foams .",
    "spin foam models @xcite can in fact be considered as topological field theories of the @xmath171 type @xcite defined on a manifold with defects .",
    "this statement is supported by the following two observations : ( i ) at the classical level , general relativity can be formulated as a topological @xmath171 theory with a set of constraints on the @xmath172 field @xcite ; at the quantum level , in spin foams , these constraints are imposed _ only _ on the @xmath156-boundary of the @xmath173-cells of a simplicial complex .",
    "thus a @xmath156-skeleton of defects where the constraints are imposed is identified .",
    "a second remark is that ( ii ) the currently studied spin foam models @xcite are based on the quantization of a version of regge simplicial gravity @xcite . at the classical level",
    ", regge action can be thought as the evaluation on a locally - flat metric of the einstein - hilbert action for a manifold with defects .",
    "the boundary of the manifold is given by the defect - network and regge action consists in fact solely of the gibbons - hawking - york boundary term @xcite , i.e. of the integral of the area density times the extrinsic curvature at the defect .",
    "the theory has finitely many degrees of freedom which are in fact associated to the defect - network .",
    "* _ infinitely many degrees of freedom_. spin foam models provide a sum over histories .",
    "an history can be obtained from a cellular decomposition of a @xmath173-manifold @xmath174 .",
    "then we can introduce a new manifold @xmath175 obtained subtracting from the original manifold the @xmath156-skeleton of the cellular decomposition . as a result , a foliation of @xmath175 results in a family of @xmath2-manifolds @xmath10 with different networks of defects .",
    "a model of this kind allows transitions between hilbert spaces @xmath30 associated to different defect - networks .",
    "this fact points to the need of considering a larger ( but still separable ) hilbert space @xmath176 obtained  la fock @xcite .",
    "the analogous of the @xmath177-particle state space would be the hilbert space @xmath178 associated to defect - networks having moduli space of dimension @xmath177 , so that @xmath176 is the closure in norm of the span of states belonging to @xmath179 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath176 is the one proper to a system with infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "the idea that purely topological theories might play an important role at the planck scale has already been noticed in the past . in the first pioneering papers on loop quantum gravity @xcite",
    ", topological invariants played a key role ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , t hooft @xcite introduced a locally finite model for 4d gravity which is topological and has dynamical string defects .",
    "it would be interesting to explore its quantum kinematics within the setting described in this paper .",
    "we conclude this section with a remark about an intriguing long - sighted perspective :    * _ locality and effective description_. topological field theories have only global degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in presence of defects , some of the degrees of freedom are associated to the defect - network . as a result , there is a finite number of degrees of freedom associated to each region of the manifold , thus leading to a notion of locality .",
    "the discrete spectrum of quantum - geometry operators sets the scale of the region .",
    "this fact points to an appealing scenario for quantum gravity where the theory has no trans - planckian degrees of freedom because it is topological ( and therefore finite ) at small scales , while at larger scales it has finitely many degrees of freedom which can be described effectively in terms of a local quantum field theory .",
    "loop quantum gravity may provide a realization of this scenario .",
    "in this paper we have studied the state space of a theory of locally - flat connections on a manifold with defects .",
    "we briefly summarize our analysis :    * the space @xmath18 of locally - flat connections modulo gauge transformations is finite - dimensional .",
    "therefore a state , i.e. a gauge- and diffeomorphism - invariant functional of the connection , is actually given by an ordinary function of a finite number of parameters ( moduli ) . a scalar product between states is introduced in terms of a functional integral over @xmath18 .",
    "the functional integral reduces to an ordinary integral over the space of moduli with a non - trivial measure .",
    "the final result is given in equation ( [ eq : measurefp ] ) .",
    "the measure consists in the product of the jacobian from gauge - fixed connections to moduli , times a faddeev - popov determinant expressed in terms of the moduli . *",
    "the field theoretical derivation of the scalar product can be compared to an a priori unrelated construction which uses the techniques proper to loop quantum gravity .",
    "this construction consists in considering states labeled by an embedded graph and build out of the holonomy of the connection . as the connection is locally - flat , these states actually depend only on the knotting of the graph with the network of defects .",
    "we consider a class of graphs @xmath56 having edge - path group @xmath59 isomorphic to the first homotopy group @xmath13 of the manifold @xmath10 . in the particular case of a defect - network arising as the @xmath7-skeleton of a cellular decomposition , the graphs @xmath56 is dual to the decomposition .",
    "these states correspond to specific functions on moduli space .",
    "moreover they suggest a natural proposal for the choice of measure involved in the definition of the scalar product : this is the haar measures for group elements associated to the links of the graph .",
    "spin network states with graph @xmath56 provide an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space .",
    "we notice that the group theoretical measure induces a non - trivial measure on moduli space via weyl integration formula . *",
    "we argue that the measure on moduli space obtained via the field theoretical construction and the one obtained from the product of haar measures coincide . proving",
    "this conjecture would establish spin network states as an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space @xmath30 build via the field theoretical construction .",
    "* we provide a test of this conjecture in the case of a single defect - line .",
    "the moduli are identified with the flux of the magnetic field through the defect .",
    "the faddeev - popov determinant is computed explicitly and the result is shown to coincide with the measure on the class - angle induced by the haar measure .",
    "the physical picture proper to the aharonov - bohm effect arises .",

    "this set is indeed a group , the fundamental group or first homotopy group , with the product given by composition of loops , the inverse given by the loop traversed in the opposite direction , and the identity given by the class of contractible loops .",
