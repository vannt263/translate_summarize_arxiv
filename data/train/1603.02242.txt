    "it is a fact of quantum mechanics that one can not simultaneously measure the position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 of a quantum state as the position and momentum operator do not commute @xmath2=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "this however does not imply that every function of these operators can not be measured simultaneously as some functions of these operators may commute . in this paper",
    "we show how one can use this fact to simultaneously learn both parameters of a displacement acting on an oscillator .",
    "we assume a harmonic oscillator with annihilation operator @xmath3 with mass @xmath4 , angular frequency @xmath5 and hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "this harmonic oscillator for example could physically represent an optical or microwave cavity mode , an lc oscillator or a nanomechanical oscillator .",
    "assume that one has prepared a state in the harmonic oscillator at some initial time @xmath7 : we will refer to this state as the sensor state . for an interval in time from @xmath7 to @xmath8 a weak time - dependent classical force acts so that during this interval the hamiltonian equals @xmath9 .",
    "the unitary evolution on the oscillator equals ( up to a phase ) @xmath10 with @xmath11 , thus picking up an additional displacement @xmath12 . determining the amplitude and phase of the displacement parameter @xmath13",
    "will roughly provide information about the amplitude and phase of the force at frequency @xmath5 .",
    "if the harmonic oscillator represents , say , a superconducting lc oscillator , then a capacitive coupling to a time - dependent classical gate voltage can similarly induce small displacements : the goal is then to simultaneously measure both amplitude and phase of the voltage signal .",
    "photons , hence one requires weak coupling and/or the oscillator and the signal being off - resonant . ]    the harmonic oscillator can also represent a nanomechanical oscillator , e.g. in @xcite the strength of a small displacement on a nanomechanical oscillator is measured via the induced shift of the resonant frequency of a coupled superconducting microwave cavity mode .",
    "determining the ultimate limits of measuring the effect of a weak force on an oscilator has been a subject of much previous study , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is now known that more complex measurement strategies do not necessarily obey ` a standard quantum limit ' ( sql ) , see e.g. @xcite , but can reach a heisenberg limit .",
    "for example , in @xcite the amplitude of a small displacement acting on a microwave cavity field was measured using an entangled atom - cavity sensor state , going beyond the sql , performing best when the displacement direction or phase is known beforehand ( see also a rydberg - atom based electrometer in @xcite ) .",
    "the focus of much theoretical and experimental research in parameter estimation for oscillators has been on measuring a phase shift , of the form @xmath14 : this is not the setting that we consider here .",
    "the idea that we put forward in this paper does not directly relate to a discussion on a sql versus heisenberg limit : the essential new idea is that we show that one can measure _ both _ parameters in a displacement simultaneously .",
    "before we provide an overview of our results , let us discuss , at a descriptive level , how several quantum states could perform as displacement sensors .",
    "a simple sensor state that one can consider for displacement sensing is a coherent state @xmath15 ( for example a vacuum state ) .",
    "for such a coherent sensor state it is clear that the shot noise in both quadratures limits the accuracy with which one can determine the parameters in a displacement @xmath16 mapping @xmath15 onto @xmath17 .",
    "using squeezed states would improve the sensitivity for one of the shift parameters while at the same time losing accuracy in estimating the other parameter , suggesting that for a single - mode sensor it might never be possible to get high accuracy for both displacement parameters .",
    "an effective way of determining an unknown displacement is to let such a displacement act on only one mode of a two - mode squeezed state as in the superdense coding protocol introduced by kimble and braunstein @xcite .",
    "the infinitely - squeezed two - mode squeezed state the paradigmatic epr state is a simultaneous eigenstate of both the difference of the positions of the oscillators @xmath18 and the sum of the momenta @xmath19 , this being possible because these operators commute .",
    "itinerant ( traveling over a transmission line , not confined in a cavity ) single and two - mode squeezed states in the microwave domain have been experimentally generated @xcite ( see an overview in @xcite ) .",
    "another simple method of measuring a displacement is to have two bosonic probe modes which _ both undergo the same displacement _ @xmath16 .",
    "one probe mode will be prepared in a squeezed position state , the other probe mode in a squeezed momentum state , so that both shifts can be determined with high accuracy bounded by the amount of squeezing available .",
    "another state that has been suggested as a good displacement sensor state is the single - mode quantum compass state @xcite , also known as a particular cat code state @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that this state equal to @xmath20 has a phase space structure in the central interference region ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : wigner ] ) ) with interference ` tiles ' with an area @xmath21 , thus allowing for a sensitivity which increases with @xmath22 . a small",
    ", @xmath23 , version of this state has been recently used to store a qubit in a microwave cavity @xcite . when @xmath24 one",
    "can show that @xmath25 so that if @xmath26 , i.e. the displaced state is orthogonal to @xmath27 itself .",
    "the state is thus sensitive to very small displacements of strength @xmath28 , but that does not imply that it performs well when @xmath29 lies in a constant range larger than @xmath30 .",
    "hence the goal of this paper is to show that for small displacements the use of two modes ( of which either only one or both undergo the unknown displacement ) is unnecessary : using a single - mode grid state sensor one can get displacement information about both parameters which also gets better with the number of photons in the state .",
    "this result holds for displacements of small strength , adding at most @xmath31 photons to a vacuum state .",
    "the results in this paper are focused on the _ single - shot _ setting : that is , preparation of the sensor state , the application of the displacement , and the subsequent measurement of the effect , is done _ once _ , no repetition of the experiment is allowed . in quantum metrology one often considers the setting where an identical experiment ( set up of sensor state , displacement happens , measure ) can be repeated to gain information .",
    "we briefly discuss the repetition set up in the conclusion . in any scenario ,",
    "single - shot or repetition , the point of the grid state is that one has effective squeezing in both quadratures thus an enhanced sensitivity in both .    in section",
    "[ sec : idea ] we give the idea behind using grid states . in section [ sec : estim ] we discuss the background on two - parameter estimation theory . in section [ sec : estimphase ]",
    "we discuss the phase estimation protocols which allow one to prepare a grid state as well as measure the effect of a displacement .",
    "we will explicitly prove how the accuracy with which one can determine both parameters in the displacement increases with photon number for grid states which are explicitly prepared and measured using a noiseless textbook phase estimation protocol . in section [ sec : qcompass ]",
    "we compare our results with a quantum compass state sensor in terms of how much accessible information one can get about a displacement based on the phase estimation measurement . in section [ sec : exp ]",
    "we report on extensive numerical simulations of executing a phase estimation protocol using a dispersive qubit - bosonic mode coupling as described in @xcite .",
    "the results in this section go much beyond @xcite by using a new phase estimation protocol which assumes no post - selection and which is information - theoretically optimized .",
    "a grid state is an approximate eigenstate of two commuting operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 acts as a shift in position , i.e. @xmath35 while @xmath36 acts as a shift in momentum , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are position and momentum eigenstates .",

    "onwards we redefine @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the dimensionless ` quadrature ' operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 so that @xmath46 and @xmath47 with canonical commutation relation @xmath2=i$ ] ( and variances @xmath48 and @xmath49 )",
    ". hence we use @xmath50 and @xmath51 . a grid state with an average number of photons",
    "@xmath22 will not be a perfect eigenstate ( @xmath1 only takes values @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 ) .",
    "rather , its wavefunction in @xmath1 can be a gaussian envelope of finite width in which one has a superposition of squeezed peaks at @xmath56 and similarly in @xmath0-space ( see an example of the wigner function in fig .  [",
    "fig : wigner ] ) .",
    "now imagine that such grid state undergoes a small displacement @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( equal to @xmath60 modulo an overall phase ) with unknown parameters @xmath61 in a small interval .",

    "one measures the eigenvalues of @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "the shifted grid state @xmath64 is then an approximate eigenstate of @xmath34 and @xmath36 with eigenvalues @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath34 and @xmath36 uniquely determine the parameters @xmath67 only when @xmath68 , i.e. the grid should be displaced by less than half the minimum distance between the grid points . a grid state with an increasing number of photons @xmath22",
    "then simply allows for a greater resolution of the eigenvalues .",
    "grid or comb states were originally proposed by gottesman , kitaev and preskill in @xcite to represent a qubit in a bosonic mode so that displacement errors can be detected and corrected , but the application for sensing was not considered .",
    "the grid state can also be viewed as the phase - space equivalent of the well - known frequency comb in which one has sharp amplitude peaks at equally - spaced frequencies in an overall gaussian envelope . a form for the finite - photon number grid state is @xmath69 which one can read as a squeezed state ( in @xmath0 ) to",
    "which one applies a sum of discrete displacements , weighed with a gaussian filter .",
    "the wavefuntion in @xmath1 is almost identical , i.e. one can show that @xmath70 the slight asymmetry of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 representation vanishes when @xmath71 . for this state one can derive that @xmath72 , neglecting @xmath73 and @xmath74 terms .",

    "in addition , our estimate @xmath134 will be only close to @xmath462 .",
    "i.e. we can not distinguish @xmath463 from @xmath464 .",
    "there will be a non - neglible probability to pick , say , a @xmath465 close to @xmath466 when @xmath63 is close to @xmath238 due to the periodicity of @xmath165 .",

    "the best form of phase estimation requires one to optimize the accuracy on the phase , that is , minimizes the variance of @xmath234 in the phase @xmath117 , given an average number of photons @xmath22 in the prepared state .",
    "a first remark is that since a variance or mean squared deviation performance metric does not give full information about the ( shape ) of the wavefunction of the grid state that one obtains , see comments in @xcite , optimality may not only depend on the variance .",
    "a second remark is that when @xmath118 is a displacement operator such as @xmath34 or @xmath36 , performing a controlled-@xmath486 gate adds @xmath487 photons to a state .",
    "sequential phase estimation protocols which minimize the variance for a given overall running time @xmath488 have been proposed @xcite ( with an improved analysis in @xcite ) under the assumption that applying @xmath486 takes time scaling _ linearly _ with @xmath489 .",
    "hence these protocols give _ no advantage _ in this setting as the number of photons scales quadratically , instead of linear with @xmath489 for ( controlled)-@xmath486 ."
