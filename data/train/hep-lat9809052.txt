    "note that we have an exact chiral symmetry generated by @xmath6 which means we will have a massless pion at @xmath5 when this symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the 4-fermion term is an irrelevant operator , so this theory should have the same continuum limit  continuum qcd  as the standard action .",
    "@xmath7 qcd is believed to have a second order finite temperature chiral phase transition for @xmath5 which weakens to a rapid crossover , with no actual phase transition , for @xmath8 .",
    "the critical exponents that describe the neighbourhood of this critical point are expected to be those of an @xmath9 spin model in 3 dimensions .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review of lattice qcd thermodynamics and critical exponents . )    for the staggered lattice formulation the critical exponents are expected to be @xmath10 or @xmath9 .",
    "( for recent work on staggered critical exponents see @xcite . ) here the advantage of being able to work at zero quark mass is clear . we can hope to see clear evidence for the second order nature of the phase transition . in addition",
    "one can measure certain critical exponents directly .",
    "in particular one can measure the exponent @xmath11 from @xmath12 where @xmath13 for mean field theory , @xmath14 for @xmath9 , and @xmath15 for @xmath10 . in the high temperature phase , the common @xmath16 and @xmath17 screening masses increase from zero as @xmath18 where @xmath19 for mean field theory , @xmath20 for @xmath9 and @xmath21 for @xmath10 .",
    "the same critical exponent governs the vanishing of the @xmath17 mass below the transition .",
    "if we now fix @xmath22 and decrease the mass @xmath23 from a finite value to zero , @xmath24 vanishes as @xmath25 where @xmath26 for mean field theory , @xmath27 for @xmath9 , and @xmath27 for @xmath10 .    of the fluctuation quantities ( susceptibilities ) , the most accessible is the `` magnetic '' susceptibility @xmath28\\ ] ] which scales as @xmath29",
    "our simulations are being carried out using hybrid molecular dynamics with noisy fermions to accommodate @xmath7 . because of the exact flavour @xmath30 symmetry at @xmath5 , the direction of symmetry breaking in the ( @xmath24,@xmath31 ) space ( or ( @xmath17,@xmath16 ) space is not determined . on a finite lattice ,",
    "this direction rotates during the run , forcing us to use @xmath32 or @xmath33 as our order parameter on each configuration .",
    "( here @xmath34 should be taken to mean a lattice average , not an ensemble average . )",
    "this estimate differs from the true value by @xmath35 , which can only be removed by working at more than 1 spatial volume for each @xmath36 .",
    "we are currently running on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 lattices at @xmath41 , and on a @xmath39 at @xmath42 .    whereas our earlier simulations at @xmath43 and @xmath44 showed a first order transition ,",
    "all @xmath45 combinations above show evidence for the expected second order transition . @xmath24 and",
    "the wilson line show a sharp , but not discontinuous , transition with no sign of metastability , unlike the previous case .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbp ] shows the @xmath46 dependence of the chiral condensate for @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , close to the transition , observables show clear signs of critical slowing down with large fluctuations over many thousands of time units .",
    "( we have simulated for as many as 39,000 time units at a single @xmath46 value . ) such a time evolution for the chiral condensate close to the transition is shown in figure  [ fig : pbp_time ] .",
    "the @xmath43 , @xmath47 runs show signs of critical fluctuations , but the transition occurs over a very narrow range and it will require more statistics to tell if it has become second order or remains first order .",
    "it is clear that we will need to extend our runs close to the phase transition .",
    "this is a consequence of the critical slowing down close to the second order transition .",
    "this currently limits our ability to extract accurate critical exponents due in part to the fact that our errors are poorly determined and partly because it prevents accurate extrapolation to infinite volume .",
    "in addition , the scaling window could be very narrow requiring us to consider more @xmath46 values close to the transition . despite this the @xmath24 data looks promising , and suggests a critical exponent @xmath48 , however , this is on the basis of statistically poor fits .",
    "the @xmath45 , @xmath47 data shows relatively modest finite volume effects .    for @xmath43 , @xmath47",
    ", we find @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath50 , while for @xmath45 , @xmath47 , @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig : masses ] shows the @xmath17 and @xmath16 screening masses for the @xmath40 , @xmath47 simulations .",
    "the @xmath17 screening mass shows the correct behaviour , decreasing to zero as @xmath46 is increased through the transition , and increasing from zero , degenerate with the @xmath16 above the transition . below the transition ,",
    "the pion mass is consistent with zero .",
    "it appears doubtful that these masses can be determined accurately enough to obtain a good estimate for @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 mass can be calculated , but even assuming it remains distinct from the @xmath54 mass above the transition , it will be difficult to tell how much of this is due to the explicit @xmath30 symmetry breaking provided by the 4-fermion interaction .",
    "@xmath7 lattice qcd with massless quarks and a weak 4-fermion interaction appears to have the expected second order transition , at least for @xmath55 .",
    "more work is needed to clarify the @xmath43 case .    with more statistics the @xmath45 simulations should produce an accurate determination of the critical exponent @xmath11 .",
    "moving to finite mass at @xmath22 should allow an accurate determination of @xmath53 .",
    "hadronic screening masses need further analysis .",
    "other order parameters remain to be analysed .",
    "unfortunately , there is no obvious way to include 4-fermion interactions with full @xmath56 chiral flavour symmetry .",
