    "electronic many - body effects play a key role in the electrical and optical properties of solids @xcite . in particular",
    ", the proper accounting for two - particles excitation energies allows one to explain specific features of the optical absorption spectrum of semiconductors and insulators @xcite . due to specific features of dielectric screening , e.g. , low dielectric constants , the interaction of the excited electrons and holes differs significantly in wide - gap insulators than that in semiconductors .",
    "exciton binding energy resulting from the strong @xmath2 interaction is often of large magnitude @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the main focus of the present work is the principal case study demonstrating that the strength of the @xmath2 interaction can be modulated by materials engineering methods .",
    "for example , the experimentally established exciton binding energy is 86  mev for and 95  mev for with band gap of 7.775  ev and 7.034  ev @xcite , respectively : both materials possessing predominantly ionic type of chemical bonding . by means of hydration of these materials the existing ionic bonds are reorganized so that a certain portion of covalency is supplied by the water molecules .",
    "the resulting crystalline alkali - earth hydroxides ( _ _ x__=mg , ca ) acquire a system integrity that is governed by the negative oxygen ions via a bridging combination of the strong covalent bonding in the hydroxyl anions and strong ionic connections @xcite .",
    "this in turn determines a multifunctionality property of compounds , which is generally based on the equal utilization of electronic characteristics such as large band gap and low refractive index ( relevant to purely ionic systems ) and covalent contributions from the oxygen within a common crystal - chemical environment . our preliminary considerations applied to have shown that this feature contributes significantly to the nature of optoelectronic properties , so that one can expect in these materials strong coulomb attraction between an excited electron and a hole and , consequently , generation of an exciton with a large binding energy .",
    "excitonic contributions to the optical absorption process can be described by numerical solution of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) with high accuracy @xcite . in this work",
    "we will study the electronic structure and optical properties of and report about band gap excitons with large binding energy of 0.46  ev for and 0.85  ev .",
    "we identify and analyze the character of exciton peaks in the optical spectrum and relate them to strong localization of the hole and electron to oxygen @xmath0 occupied states as well as to oxygen and metal @xmath1 empty states , respectively .",
    "the fundamental aspect of the article is that we have found that in crystalline hydroxides and the many - body effects in the optical absorption spectra play a crucial role . from a practical point of view",
    ", materials under consideration may serve as interesting hosts , so that our results definitely have important implication for different applications of the materials in optoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "the multifunctional hydroxides crystallize into the -type structure of space group of @xmath3(refs .",
    "@xcite ) with the unit cell containing two metal cations and two anionic groups .",
    "we have employed vienna _",
    "ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite together with the potential projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4-centered optimized @xmath5 @xmath6-point mesh was selected for all dft and gw calculations . to ensure data accuracy and clarity ,",
    "the calculations were performed within the large plane - wave basis set with @xmath7  ev cutoff , and with the application of gw - versions of paw perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) pseudopotentials @xcite , which represent @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 valence electron configurations for , , and atoms , respectively . in our computations spin - orbit coupling",
    "was not included into consideration .",
    "studies of ground state properties and electronic structure have been performed within the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 ) hybrid functional @xcite .",
    "optical properties have been studied by using the many - body hedin s gw approximation @xcite combined with numerical solution of bse according to the strategy developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which utilizes the wave functions derived from hybrid functional calculations as a starting point for subsequent gw numerical procedures . for description of exchange effects in a periodic ion - covalent insulating system",
    "we employ the relation @xmath12 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) that approximates the mixing coefficient @xmath13 ( fraction of the fock exchange ) in the xc potential in terms of the effective screening of the bare nonlocal exchange part of the electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "in our study , we start with preliminary series of calculations in order to ascertain the relevant value of @xmath13 via @xmath14 that will consistently be utilized further as a material - specific parameter related to the short - range fock exchange in the hse06 hybrid functional . detailed considerations concerning numerical and theoretical treatment of the mixing parameter @xmath13 in terms of @xmath14 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . based on that",
    ", we could also mention that due to the relation @xmath15 , which is common to ion - covalent insulators , such a parametrization is generally safe for tuning the optimal @xmath13 ( here @xmath16 is the thomas - fermi screening length and @xmath17 characterizes the range separation in the hse06 hybrid functional ) .",
    "evaluation of the mixing coefficient @xmath13 was carried out according to the iterative procedure as follows : first , lattice relaxation has been performed and dielectric properties was studied within the pbe - gga .",
    "then the macroscopic dielectric tenzor was evaluated using the density functional perturbation theory @xcite . taking these elements as initial guess for @xmath13 via @xmath14 ( @xmath18 )",
    ", improvements to the macroscopic dielectric matrix was obtained by using @xmath13 as argument in the modified hse06 hybrid functional .",
    "the calculated @xmath19 and @xmath13 are provided in table  [ tab : table_eps ] . in these calculations the local field ( lf )",
    "effects have been included into consideration .",
    "the subsequent self - consistent electronic structure calculations were carried out using the relaxed lattice geometries within the hse06 functionals and the mixing parameters @xmath13 of table  [ tab : table_eps ] .",
    ".[tab : table_eps ] calculated macroscopic dielectric matrix and fraction of the fock exchange mixing coefficient @xmath13 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our last step is proper interpretation of excitonic signatures seen in the optical spectra of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_2 ] .",
    "analysis of pdos [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] ] shows that mainly the combination of oxygen and metal are responsible for the excitons possessing largest binding energy . in terms of characters of the electronic states",
    "centered either on oxygen anion or metal cation the following two assignments of one - photon vertical transitions to low - lying excited states can be made : ( i ) the intra-``molecular '' transition @xmath20 with the excited configuration @xmath21 , since @xmath22 bonding orbitals are situated significantly below , low - lying excited states correspond to planar electronic excitations relating to oxygen of the hydroxyl anion , and ( ii ) the transition + @xmath20 + with the excited configurations @xmath23 and @xmath24 for and _ x _ , respectively ; this nonlocal ( off - site ) transition deals with the induced backward charge transfer along connection and is associated with the partial decrease of the @xmath25 electron density on the oxygen and the proportionate increase of the @xmath1 electron density on the metal cation .",
    "thus , the central spectral feature is splitting of the excitonic branch of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] between two prominent peaks of different intensity , which can be regarded as follows : the larger peak at @xmath26 ev ( @xmath27  ev for ) corresponds to the strong molecular component of the electron - hole state localized at the oxygen of the hydroxyl anion , whereas the origin of the smaller one at @xmath28  ev ( @xmath29  ev ) is suggested to be much closer to the electron - hole pair separated on the nearest - neighbors .    in order to explain the strong excitonic binding in the hydroxides we refer mainly to a rigorous physical picture established for ion - covalent compounds ",
    "the more the electronic charge is localized , the greater strength many - body contributions exert @xcite . in this context , aside from the standard feature of the weak screening in the hydroxides we would emphasize the key role of the unoccupied _ s_-type orbitals located in the bottommost cb and hybridized with metal cation @xmath1 orbitals , which , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , significantly strengthen the coulomb and exchange parts of the electron - hole interaction .",
    "in summary , we have presented the first - principles description of the electronic structure and optical properties of multifunctional hydroxides by using dft calculations with hse06 hybrid functional and many - body calculations with gw - bse . within the frameworks of the combined theoretical approach",
    "we have found an intimate connection between the crystal - chemical properties and the relevant features of the electronic spectra . with respect to the optoelectronic properties of and",
    "this has allowed us to provide rationalization for a strong coulomb attraction between an excited electron and a hole and thereby to predict for the first time the existence of excitonic states possessing large binding energy .",
    "imaginary part of the dielectric function and reflectivity spectra show strong peaks corresponding to the bound excitons .",
    "the hexagonal lattice environment has an ultimate effect on the excitonic states making their structure highly anisotropic and directly dependent on the polarization of the incident light in such a way that it can be realized only in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "we have identified and analyzed the origin of the excitons , which can be attributed to strong localization of the hole and electron to oxygen @xmath0 occupied states as well as to oxygen and earth metal @xmath1 empty states , respectively .",
    "our results are expected to initiate further experimental and theoretical studies of and .",
