    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are a rich and nearby system where we can observe dynamic evolution as well as the results of star formation throughout time .",
    "the system also includes the magellanic stream ( ms ) , a hi gas stream  @xcite connected to the mcs spanning at least 200@xmath0 on the sky  @xcite , where no stellar counterpart has yet been identified  @xcite .",
    "other important structures belonging to this system are the magellanic bridge , containing neutral hydrogen , stars and star clusters linking the mcs  @xcite and the leading arm ( la ) or leading arm feature ( laf ) , a gas stream on the opposite side of the ms .    given the higher velocities ( than previously estimated ) for the mcs in recent works  @xcite , it is thought that the mcs are completing their first passage around the milky - way ( mw ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by proper motion measurements using hst @xcite and _ gaia _ data release 1  @xcite .",
    "thus , the gravitational interaction between the small and the large magellanic clouds ( smc and lmc , respectively ) maybe playing a larger role than the mw in triggering star formation .    in the recent decades , a wide range of dynamical simulations of the mcs have improved our understanding of their substructures , taking advantage of more reliable proper motion measurements , among other enhanced initial conditions ( e. g. , masses , gas fraction , ellipticity , stellar disk scale length ) .",
    "using n - body simulations , @xcite reproduced the ms and la as substructures formed through tidal interaction between the clouds .",
    "their work reproduced for the first time the spatial and kinematic bifurcations in the la and in the ms .",
    "the mcs simulations of @xcite over the last 800 myr are able to reproduce the off - center bar and the hi spirals in the lmc .",
    "they also predict that a substantial number of smc stars could be transferred to the lmc to form diffuse halo components around that galaxy . restricting their study to the smc , @xcite designed chemodynamical simulations using a smc ` dwarf spheroidal model ' ( an extended hi gas disk and a spherical distribution for old stars ) , which they argue is a better description of the stellar and gas kinematic properties . in their fiducial model , the final distribution of old stars is more regular ( spherical ) than that of the younger stars ( which form basically a bar - like structure ) .",
    "@xcite simulate a large set of models based on proper motion data from  @xcite and from  @xcite , predicting two main encounters between the smc and the lmc ( 260 myr and 1.97 gyr ago ) , suggesting a joint history for these galaxies .",
    "@xcite present two models for the magellanic system , designed to explain the ms as the action of lmc tides on the smc . in their models the lmc is a one - armed spiral and features as well a warped , off - centre stellar bar as a result of the gravitational interaction .",
    "the possible association  between the mcs and ultra - faint dwarf galaxies recently discovered in the dark energy survey  ( des ; * ? ? ? * ) footprint has revived the search for dwarf galaxy satellites of the lmc or smc  @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery by  @xcite of a stellar cloud with a length of 10 kpc within the lmc tidal radius ( and an additional extension farther west of the lmc ) shows that the exploration of the outer area of the mcs has an important potential for new discoveries .",
    "it also reinforces the idea that newly discovered structures can be used to trace the gravitational interaction history of the mcs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the existence of stellar arcs and multiple spiral arms in the northern lmc periphery ( without comparable counterparts in southern regions of the smc ) could be attributed to repeated close interactions between the lmc and the smc .",
    "a large number of simulations predict clumpy substructures formed by a spheroidal distribution surrounding the smc ( see for example the references listed in section  [ origin ] ) , though there is no specific prediction of over - densities as large as those presented here .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of this structure reinforces the scenario where the lmc and the smc have had recent and drastic encounters .    in what follows ,",
    "we report a stellar over - density located 8@xmath0 north of the smc center , hereafter referred to as the small magellanic cloud northern over - density ( smcnod ) . in section  [ data ]",
    "we describe the dark energy camera  ( decam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data sets from the combined des and the magellanic satellites survey - maglites , and the criteria used here to select stellar sources . in section  [ analysis ] we describe the analysis of the stellar populations and the structure of the smcnod .",
    "we conclude by discussing the smcnod stellar population and gas content , as well as its formation and fate , in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we present a brief description of the data set used here from both des and maglites observations .",
    "the des data used in this work is the year - two quick release ( des - y2q1 ) catalog , constructed using 26,590 decam exposures .",
    "the des - y2q1 images were taken between august 2013 and february 2014 and between august 2014 and february 2015 , in the first two years of the survey .",
    "the images cover most of the des footprint ( 5,000 square degrees ) , with the exception of a few hundred square degrees in the region near the south galactic pole .",
    "we refer to  section 2 of  @xcite for a detailed description of the data and the star selection criteria .",
    "maglites is a national optical astronomy observatories ( noao ) community survey that is using decam to complete an annulus of contiguous imaging around the periphery of the magellanic system  @xcite .",
    "the maglites data used here are composed of 16 decam 90s exposures in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "the positions for each maglites decam exposure are listed in tab .",
    "the maglites exposures were taken in 27 june 2016 , in an effort to enlarge decam coverage in the smcnod region .",
    "maglites images were reduced using the dark energy survey data management ( desdm ) pipeline , and source detection was performed separately on each exposure .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the structural parameters listed in table  [ features ] were fit using a marginalized likelihood approach and  _ emcee _ , an affine - invariant ensemble sampler for markov chain monte carlo models  @xcite .",
    "we applied the marginalized likelihood fit to the  healpix pixels from figure  [ dpc2 ] , modelling the stellar density with a plummer profile  @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath9 was derived by adding the @xmath10 flux within the ellipse bounded by the smcnod truncation radius converted from the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , also using equation from  @xcite : @xmath11 from this @xmath10 band flux we subtract the flux within an ellipse with the same area shifted to 3@xmath0 north of the smcnod .",
    "small deviations in the comparison field position lead to small variations in the derived absolute magnitude ( @xmath12 magnitudes ) .",
    "the stellar mass of the smcnod was estimated by measuring the luminosity function ( lf ) , filtered by the intermediate - age and more metal - poor ( @xmath13=6 gyr and z=0.001 ) cmd mask .",
    "the smcnod lf is compared to a field immediately above the over - density , with equal area and located 3@xmath14 north of the smcnod center . after subtracting the field from the smcnod lf",
    ", we then use the same model to evaluate the mass corresponding to each lf bin .",
    "the subtracted lf comprises 6068 stars within the range @xmath15 , corresponding to the mass range of 0.90 - 0.99 @xmath6 .",
    "based on this number and mass range , we normalized an evolved kroupa mass function  @xcite , and we computed a stellar mass for the smcnod @xmath16 .",
    "the young population density is about one tenth of the intermediate - age population density and thus the computed young population mass is included in the mass error range for smcnod . according to this estimate",
    ", the smcnod has a stellar mass comparable to 47 tuc  @xcite , but it is fainter ( for 47 tuc , @xmath17 , following  ( * ? ? ? * updated 2010 ) ) .",
    "we estimated the smcnod dynamical mass ( @xmath18 ) using eq .",
    "7 - 84 from @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the smc mass , @xmath21 is the smcnod tidal radius and @xmath22 is the distance between the smc and smcnod centers . assuming the smcnod tidal radius as 1.5@xmath0 ( from the bottom panel in figure  [ dpc ] ) and @xmath22 = 8@xmath0",

    "@xcite estimate that the smc dark halo has a mass of @xmath24 @xmath6 in the inner 3 kpc for a @xmath10 band mass to light ratio @xmath25 .",
    "this mass agrees reasonably well with smc rotation curves . using this conservative estimate for the smc mass ,",
    "the smcnod dynamical mass is 2 @xmath26 @xmath6 , a value thirty times greater than calculated for the stellar mass .     and",
    "@xmath27 ) is indicated .",
    "the smc is close to the center of the figure and the lmc is located near the bright spot in the lower left corner .",
    "no significant excess of hi gas is observed at the position of the smcnod ( dotted ellipse).,width=280 ]    the hi gas map could provide more insight into the nature of the smcnod , as well as a possible connection to the smc .",
    "the hi gas column density map from the gass third data release   is shown in figure  [ hi ] . while the lmc and the smc hi gas contents are obvious , there is no apparent excess of gas",
    "associated with the position of the smcnod .",
    "we also use the gass data to look for peaks in the velocity distribution of the gas within the velocity range from -495 km / s to 495 km / s ( 1 km / s steps ) .",
    "the emission for one square degree centered on the smcnod exhibits two main peaks : 94 km / s and 186 km / s ( which are shown in figure  [ v94 ] and  [ v186 ] , respectively ) .",
    "these velocities agree with the velocity field related to the magellanic stream at the smcnod position , at a ms longitude l@xmath28 -25@xmath0 .",
    "see for example the figure 8 in  @xcite .",
    "we discuss details about hi gas distribution in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "using des and maglites data , we have found and analyzed a stellar over - density located about 8@xmath0 north of the smc center .",
    "the stellar density and surface brightness associated with this feature lie significantly above the values expected from the extrapolated stellar profile of the smc itself .",
    "this is true even when we consider only the contribution from the rgb stars .",
    "previous surveys around the smcnod did not reveal any stellar over - density similar to the one measured here .",
    "this may be due to either their non - contiguous area or their lower photometric depth .",
    "the fact that the structure  discussed here has a density peak lying significantly in excess of the expected smc exponential density profile ( or above the combined smc and galactic background ) and follows a roughly elliptical profile encourage us to argue that it is a distinct smc substructure . on the other hand , the cmd analysis indicates that the stellar populations are very similar to those found in the main smc body , and the smcnod lies at a similar heliocentric distance as the smc .",
    "the @xmath29 color distributions of smcnod and smc stars for three magnitude ranges in the hess diagram are shown in the left panel of figure  [ histo ] , whereas their number counts in bins of @xmath7 magnitude filtered by the cmd mask and normalized ( to the areas ) are presented in the right panel of the same figure .",
    "the color distributions look very similar . for rc stars ( solid lines )",
    ", there may be a slight preference for the smcnod being a little bluer than the smc .",
    "however , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test indicates that the two rc populations come from the same parent distribution ( @xmath30 ) . as for the luminosity function comparison ,",
    "the two distributions look similar as well .",

    "@xmath31 v@xmath32 @xmath31 187 km s@xmath33).,width=280 ]        the results of considering the hi gas velocity channels are inconclusive .",
    "the v@xmath32=186 km / s channel map ( figure  [ v186 ] ) shows a few links between the smc and the smcnod , while the v@xmath32=94 km / s channel map ( figure  [ v94 ] ) shows a bar - shaped gas cloud detached from the smc main body .",
    "a looping feature is visible in the v@xmath32=186 km / s channel map that could be the result of a weak gas inflow ( from the smc , counterclockwise ) .",
    "but in summary , the smcnod does not seem to contain a large amount of gas and it is currently unclear whether the hi gas features present in either velocity channel map are connected to it .",
    "the gas associated with the ms has a drift rate of @xmath34 49 km / s away from the lmc , as obtained by  @xcite . using these results , an age of 2.5 gyr",
    "is expected for the ms . in this sense ,",
    "the gas features surrounding the smc should be very recent ( a few hundred million years or even younger ) , showing a complex dynamics .",
    "taken at face value , the gas properties around the smcnod are more consistent with gas - poor dwarf spheroidals  @xcite and ultra - faint dwarf galaxies in the local group  @xcite .",
    "regarding the formation of the smcnod , the most likely scenario is that this structure was formed by material pulled from the smc disk through tidal stripping , given the recent n - body simulations as cited in sec .",
    "[ intro ] . following the classical galactic interaction theory of @xcite ,",
    "many other works predict the existence of a magellanic counter - bridge as a counterpart to the magellanic bridge ( e. g. @xcite ) . in the north - west part of the smc a kinematical substructure discovered by @xcite is associated to the magellanic counter - bridge , as an observational counterpart .",
    "the simulations also predict a spread of stars as a result of an lmc - smc close encounters .",
    "see for example the tidal tail in figure 5 of  @xcite , the set of particles located southwest of the smc in figure 12 from @xcite , and the smc stellar distribution in figure 4 and 5 of @xcite .",
    "also , a conspicuous clump of young stars can be seen for the fiducial model simulated by @xcite in their figure 5 , 6 and 9 , located 4 degrees from the center of the smc , along with a stream - like feature on the opposite side .",
    "earlier simulations present a spread of particles around the smc , for example figure 10b of and figure 6a of @xcite . finally , the substantial stream - like stellar overdensity in the northern periphery of the lmc centre recently discovered by  @xcite , with characteristics similar to the smcnod , also corroborates this scenario for the smcnod formation based on close lmc - smc interactions .",
    "if the smcnod is the result of an lmc - smc collision , a contemporaneous peak in star formation is expected in both galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the results of star formation history ( sfh ) analyses have large uncertainties , and there is a significant spatial variation for the sfh in the lmc   and smc  @xcite .",
    "sfh variations are larger when based on different models ( isochrones ) and/or stellar tracers ( rgb , carbon or variable stars ) and the mcs sfh is still far from being fully characterized in spite of much work .",
    "even so , it is interesting to note that most of the references listed above agree with a simultaneous peak in sfr between 4 - 6 gyr ( also discussed in @xcite ) , the age of the main stellar population of the smcnod .",
    "a complete reconstruction of the sfh of the smcnod ( and also a comparison to the sfh of various smc regions ) is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "another possible scenario for the smcnod origin is a tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) , an object formed as described by  @xcite , where mainly gas is stripped from past mergers and resemble as dwarf galaxies , where the stars are forming during / after the main encounter .",
    "the lack of dark matter in tdgs makes them fragile , leading to short lifetimes ( a few gyr ) as cohesive systems .",
    "this scenario for the smcnod formation is disfavored due to its poor gas content and predominantly intermediate - age stars ( at least 6 gyr ) , compared to an expected young tdg stellar population  @xcite . on the other hand , numerical simulations by  @xcite show tdgs",
    "could survive at least 3 gyr , despite the lack of dark matter content .",
    "this is corroborated by the existence of the relatively old tdg vcc2062 observed by  , where its parent galaxies have likely merged .",
    "the scenario where the smcnod is a primordial galaxy orbiting and/or merging with the smc could be favored if the stellar populations of the smcnod have narrower age and metallicity ranges than those of the smc .",
    "this would make the smcnod more consistent with typical dwarf spheroidal galaxies . an intriguing possibility for the origin of the smcnod is the `` resonant stripping '' predicted by @xcite .",
    "this process allows for an efficient removal of stars in a dwarf - dwarf encounter , where the smaller dwarf loses stars by a resonance between the angular frequency of its orbit and spin , changing the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass .",
    "simulations also predict that dwarf - disk galaxies will evolve into compact spheroidal systems with stream - like and shell - like structures , resembling the smcnod shape around the smc .",
    "future deep photometric surveys of the smc / lmc outskirts could reveal similar structures , testing the significance of this `` resonant stripping '' in the model .    the relatively old age for most of the stars in the smc - nod rules out its origin as being formed by hi gas from the magellanic stream .",
    "as  @xcite and  @xcite point out , the expected age of putative ms stars should be @xmath35 2.5 gyr , less than half of the characteristic age found for the over - density stars .",
    "the origin of the smcnod younger population may or may not be attributed to the same physical mechanism as the intermediate - age population . since the smc - lmc interaction is known to have triggered star formation at recent times ( as in the case of the magellanic bridge , see for example  @xcite and  @xcite ) , we can not rule out that this interaction may be responsible for the younger smcnod population .",
    "the fate of the smcnod has interesting implications for the magellanic system generally .",
    "if the smcnod is an unstable object , such as a stellar cloud , it should dissipate into the smc main body or , if unbound to the smc , be ejected and dissipate eventually into the galactic field",
    ". however , for the first hypothesis to hold , the smc truncation radius must be@xmath36 kpc ( see the smcnod limits in figure  [ dpc ] ) to encompass the entire stellar cloud presented here . as a reference ,",
    "the truncation radius derived from chemo - dynamical simulations involving smc - like objects is in the range between 5 - 7.5 kpc  @xcite , not enough to include the entire smcnod .",
    "radial velocities and proper motions of likely stellar members will constrain systemic and internal kinematics of the smcnod , as well as its internal motions .",
    "metallicities and other abundance estimates may indicate similarities and differences between the smcnod stars and those belonging to the main smc body",
    ". an internal age and/or metallicity gradient ( or its absence ) may also constrain its nature as either a primordial or tidal object .",
    "finally , the smcnod discovery shows that the magellanic system , despite being relatively well - studied , still hides surprising substructures that may be revealed with deep photometric surveys .",
    "the discovery of the smcnod at such a large distance from the smc should provide an additional constraint for simulations of the magellanic system .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a stellar over - density 8@xmath0 north of the center of the small magellanic cloud ( small magellanic cloud northern over - density ; smcnod ) using data from the first two years of the dark energy survey ( des ) and the first year of the magellanic satellites survey ( maglites ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smcnod is indistinguishable in age , metallicity and distance from the nearby smc stars , being primarly composed of intermediate - age stars ( 6 gyr , z=0.001 ) , with a small fraction of young stars ( 1 gyr , z=0.01 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smcnod has an absolute magnitude of @xmath1 -7.7 , @xmath2 kpc , and @xmath3 = 31.2 mag arcsec@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a stellar mass of @xmath5 @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the smcnod was probably removed from the smc disk by tidal stripping , since it is located near the magellanic stream trail , and the literature indicates likely recent lmc - smc encounters . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is supported by the lack of significant hi gas . </S>",
    "<S> other potential scenarios for the smcnod origin are a transient over - density within the smc tidal radius or a primordial smc satellite in advanced stage of disruption .    </S>",
