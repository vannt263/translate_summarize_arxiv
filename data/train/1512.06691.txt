    "a typical representation is given in figure [ fig - striations ] , which shows the propagation through a medium consisting of a periodic superposition of two layers .",

    "the second equation of just states that the front propagates with a normal velocity @xmath11 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean curvature and @xmath19 is a positive _ curvature coefficient .",
    "_ this latter coefficient is related to the _ surface tension _ effects .",
    "the propagation is not just a geometric one ( as it was the case for example in @xcite ) because here the _ combustion rate _",
    "@xmath20 depends also on the temperature at the front .",
    "this dependence is typically given by an _ arrhenius kinetic _ of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a _",
    "prefactor _ and @xmath23",
    "is related to the _ activation energy_. these parameters can depend on the layers which means that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as far as the other data are concerned , @xmath26 represents the _ thermal diffusivity , _ @xmath27 the _ heat capacity _ , and @xmath28 represents a fraction of the total _ heat release _ and which serves to heat the solid thus making the combustion self - sustained . for more details about this model",
    "see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "from now we assume that each parameter @xmath29 satisfies :    1 .",
    "[ hyp - param-1 ] the function @xmath30 is measurable and @xmath2-periodic .",
    "[ hyp - param-2 ] there are constants @xmath31 such that @xmath32    the parameter @xmath33 is assumed to be a function from @xmath34 into @xmath35 such that :    1 .",
    "[ hyp - arrh-1 ] for almost each @xmath36 , @xmath37 is continuous and nondecreasing .",
    "[ hyp - arrh-2 ] for each @xmath38 , @xmath39 is measurable and @xmath2-periodic .",
    "[ hyp - arrh-3 ] there is a constant @xmath40 such that @xmath41 4 .",
    "[ hyp - arrh-4 ] for any @xmath38 , we have : @xmath42    in the above , @xmath43 denotes the interval @xmath44 .",
    "the function @xmath33 is in particular of carathodory s type by [ hyp - arrh-1][hyp - arrh-2 ] .",
    "note that [ hyp - arrh-1][hyp - arrh-4 ] are satisfied by the typical combustion rate in whenever @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy [ hyp - param-1][hyp - param-2 ] .",
    "this is exactly what occurs for the striated solid medium we consider where all these parameters are constant on the layers .",
    "they therefore take just two values for the case presented in figure [ fig - striations ] .",
    "let us point out at this stage that for reasons associated to mathematical analysis , the existing papers usually impose a `` positive lower bound to the front s speed''that is to @xmath33 in our case , see for instance @xcite . in our setting , this might be not satisfactory because the typical @xmath33 in decays towards zero as @xmath45",
    "actually , we will be brought to occasionally prescribe a `` slower decay '' to @xmath33 at the neighborhood of @xmath46 , but we will always treat situations where it may go to zero . moreover a large part of our results work for the arrhenius law given in  .",
    "let us continue with some general comments on the literature .",
    "models of similar type are considered in @xcite but with slightly different assumptions . in @xcite , the striations are vertical and the front s profile is a straight line . as a consequence its equation reduces to an ode . in @xcite ,",
    "the propagation is purely geometric ( that is to say @xmath47 only ) and the analysis concerns the sole front s equation . in the more recent paper @xcite ,",
    "a full free boundary system somewhat similar to ours has been studied in the context of solidification process in crystal growth .",
    "the front s propagation is governed by a hamilton - jacobi equation ( where the surface tension effects are neglected ) . the main purpose of @xcite concerns the global in time existence of a solution of the cauchy problem via the study of the regularity of the expanding front .",
    "the front s velocity considered is relaxed regularitywise : it is just hlder continuous as compared to the natural lipschitz regularity used for hamilton jacobi equations . in all these references",
    ", the speed of propagation is assumed to have a positive lower bound .    in this paper , we focus on the study of travelling wave solutions to  . our first purpose is to show the existence of such solutions .",
    "this comes to looking for fronts and temperatures of the form@xmath48 where @xmath49 will be the speed of the wave and @xmath50 its profile .",
    "it is convenient to fix the front through the change of variable  @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to the problem of finding a triplet  @xmath52 such that@xmath53 a\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\\nu}=\\frac{c\\,g}{\\sqrt{1+v_{y}^{2 } } } , & \\quad x = v(y),\\\\[1ex ] u(x , y)\\rightarrow0 , & \\quad \\mbox{as~$x\\rightarrow -\\infty$ , } \\end{cases } \\label{t - eqn}\\ ] ] and@xmath54 note that if there exists a travelling wave , the profile @xmath50 will be defined up to an additive constant . for simplification and without loss of generality",
    ", we will be brought in the course of the analysis to fix this constant .",
    "let us recall that equation has been the object of a thorough study in @xcite but only for @xmath47 .",
    "the existence of a travelling wave @xmath55 is proved with some characterization of the speed @xmath56 with respect to the curvature coefficient @xmath19 . in @xcite ,",
    "this analysis is extended to oblique striations and in @xcite to almost periodic media . in this paper",
    ", we will establish the existence of a nontrivial travelling wave solution for the whole system . if we consider a general @xmath33 satisfying [ hyp - arrh-1][hyp - arrh-4 ] , we will need to assume the period ( or more precisely the ratio period/@xmath19 ) to be small enough .",
    "this includes in particular the combustion rate in . for general periods we will need to consider a more restrictive class of ( degenerate ) @xmath33 , see .",
    "we unfortunately do not know whether these travelling wave solutions are unique .",
    "nevertheless we can give some precise characterization by considering their homogenization as the period tends to zero .",
    "this is the second purpose of this paper .",
    "let us first mention that a similar homogenization problem has been considered in @xcite for media with vertical striations .",
    "a remarkable difference with our setting is the absence of surface tension effects ( recall that the front s profile is a straight line in that case ) .",
    "here we propose an homogenization analysis that will provide information on the curvature effects too .",
    "for that we allow the curvature coefficient to depend on the period .",
    "this amounts to consider a family of triplets @xmath57 satisfying : @xmath58 a\\left(\\frac{y}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\frac{\\partial u^{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial\\nu}=\\frac { c^{\\varepsilon}\\,g\\left(\\frac{y}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1+(v_{y}^{\\varepsilon})^{2 } } } , & \\quad x = v^{\\varepsilon}(y),\\\\[1ex ] u^{\\varepsilon}(x , y)\\rightarrow0 , & \\quad\\mbox{as~$x\\rightarrow -\\infty$ , } \\end{cases } \\label{eps - t - eqn}\\ ] ] and@xmath59 for some given @xmath60-periodic parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc .",
    ", so that @xmath63 is the new period of the medium",
    ". we will show that the triplet @xmath57 converges towards some @xmath64 , as @xmath65 , if and only if the ratio @xmath66 converges towards some @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "this will define a continuum of homogenized waves parametrized by @xmath68 for which several characteristics will be easier to compute such as the speed , the temperature at the front , etc .",
    "as far as the speed is concerned , we will show that the map @xmath69 is ( smooth and ) decreasing .",
    "this means that the surface tension effects slow down the propagation .",
    "also , the minimal and maximal speeds are achieved ( only ) at the regimes @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . for both of these regimes",
    "we will derive an explicit formula for @xmath72 .",
    "surprisingly for @xmath73 , @xmath72 is not given by some mean of the combustion rate .",
    "we shall see for instance that , for the typical model , it reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the mean values of @xmath62 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the respective width of each layer has no influence in that regime as compared of course to the other intrinsic parameters of the material .",
    "this original feature was already observed in @xcite for a pure geometric propagation .",
    "here we somewhat extend this observation for the full system `` front - temperature . ''",
    "note finally that once the speed is known , the temperature @xmath78 will be an explicit exponential entirely determined by @xmath72 .",
    "as far as the front s profile is concerned , we will need a more careful analysis to get some interesting information .",
    "it indeed turns out that the homogenized profile is always a straight line ( normalized to zero ) .",
    "we will then analyze the microscopic oscillations of the front s profile by establishing an asymptotic expansion of the form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 will be some corrector .",
    "we will show that this corrector is entirely determined by @xmath68 and satisfies a pure geometric equation of the form considered in @xcite .",
    "as a byproduct , our analysis thus provides some relationship between these works and the whole system `` front - temperature . '' in the limiting regime @xmath70 , we will show that the corrector equals zero everywhere so that the front is `` almost a straight line '' at the microscopic level too . to get more information in that case",
    ", we will then establish a second - order expansion of the form : @xmath81 where we will identify the profile @xmath82 too .",
    "the identification of @xmath80 in the other limiting regime @xmath73 is more difficult and remains open .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be done in the concluding remarks , see section [ conclusion ] .",
    "technically , the proof of the monotonicity of @xmath83 will be the most difficult .",
    "it will rely on the implicit function theorem .",
    "the existence of a travelling wave solution will rely on the schauder s fixed point theorem as well as on careful lower bounds on the temperature at the front . for the homogenization",
    ", we will not need sophisticated tools such as the two - scale convergence , etc .",
    ", thanks to general arguments showing that @xmath84 and @xmath78 can a priori not depend on @xmath3 anymore .",
    "the identification of @xmath72 will call for different technical properties such as , for example , the hlder regularity of the temperature @xmath85 .",
    "let us finally give some more references on related topics .",
    "following the inhomogeneity considered , one can as well obtain pulsating travelling fronts , that is where the speed of the travelling wave is no longer a constant but is periodic in time .",
    "the preceding references @xcite are closely related to that subject . for a rather complete study in the framework of reaction advection diffusion equations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "finally , for a survey on travelling waves , be it in homogeneous , periodic or heterogeneous random media , see @xcite .",
