    "executing computation and communication tasks @xcite with time - dependent interactions in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite have attracted more and more interests in recent years .",
    "it has been shown that , the adiabatic passage , resonant pulses , and some other methods can be used to realize the evolution process . among of them , the adiabatic passage techniques are known for their robustness against variations of experimental parameters . therefore , many schemes have been proposed with adiabatic passage techniques in quantum information processing field . for example , rapid adiabatic passage , stimulated raman adiabatic passage , and their variants @xcite have been widely used to perform population transfers in two- or three - level systems .",
    "the system keeps in the instantaneous ground state of its time - dependent hamiltonian during the entire evolution process under an adiabatic control of a quantum system . to ensure that the adiabatic condition is always satisfied",
    ", the control parameters in the hamiltonian should be well designed , which usually issue in relatively long execution time .",
    "although little heating or friction will be created when the system remains in the instantaneous ground state , the long time required may make the operation useless or even impossible to implement because decoherence would spoil the intended dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "using resonant pulses , the scheme may has a relatively high speed , but it requires exact pulse areas and resonances .",
    "therefore , accelerating the adiabatic passage towards the perfect final outcome is a good idea and perhaps the most reasonable way to actually fight against the decoherence that is accumulated during a long operation time .",
    "consequently , some alternative approaches have been put forward by combining the virtues of adiabatic techniques and resonant pulses together for achieving controlled quantum state evolutions with both high speed and fidelity , such as optimal control theory @xcite and composite pulses @xcite .",
    "recently , by designing nonadiabatic shortcuts to speed up quantum adiabatic process , a new technique named `` shortcuts to adiabaticity '' ( sta ) @xcite opens a new chapter in the fast and robust quantum state control .",
    "as two famous methods of sta , `` transitionless quantum driving '' ( tqd ) @xcite and inverse engineering @xcite based on lewis - riesenfeld invariants @xcite have been intensively focused , they have been applied in different kinds of fields including `` fast quantum information processing '' , `` fast cold - atom '' , `` fast ion transport '' , `` fast wave - packet splitting '' , `` fast expansion '' , etc . @xcite .",
    "for example , with invariant - based inverse engineering , a fast population transfer in a three - level system has been achieved by chen and muga @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a scheme for fast generation of three - atom singlet states by tqd .",
    "these schemes have shown the powerful application for invariant - based inverse engineering and tqd in qip .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that , invariant - based inverse engineering and tqd are strongly related and potentially equivalent to each other .",
    "invariant - based method is convenience and effective with a hamiltonian which admits known structures for the invariants . but for most systems , the invariants are unknown or hard to be solved . as for tqd , it will not meet this difficult point .",
    "however , some terms of hamiltonian constructed by tqd , which are difficult to be realized in experiments , may appear when we accelerate adiabatic schemes .",
    "therefore , how to avoid these problematic terms is a notable problem .",
    "till now , some schemes @xcite have been proposed to solve the problem of the tqd method recently .",
    "for example , ibez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have produced a sequence of sta by examining the limitations and capabilities of superadiabatic iterations .",
    "_ @xcite have also studied the sta for a two - level system with multiple schrdinger pictures , and subsequently , song _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have expanded the method in a three - level system based on two nitrogen - vacancy - center ensembles coupled to a transmission line resonator . moreover , without directly using the counterdiabatic hamiltonian , torrontegui _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have used the dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian to find alternative hamiltonians that achieved the same goals as speed - up schemes with lie transforms .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a method for constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity by a substitute of counterdiabatic driving terms .    in this paper , inspired by tqd and the previous schemes @xcite , a new scheme for reverse engineering of a hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators",
    "is proposed for eliminating the terms of hamiltonian which are hard to be realized in practice .",
    "the present scheme is focus on only one or parts of moving states in a @xmath0-dimension ( @xmath1 ) system , that is different from tqd with which all instantaneous eigenstates evolve parallel . according to the numerical simulation , the present scheme not only contains the results of tqd , but also has more free parameters , which make this scheme more flexible .",
    "moreover , the problematic terms of hamiltonian may be eliminated by suitably choosing these new free parameters . for the sake of clearness",
    ", an example is given to realize the population transfer for a rydberg atom , where numerical simulation shows the scheme is effective .",
    "therefore , this scheme may be used to construct a hamiltonian which can be realized in experiments .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the section of `` reverse engineering of a hamiltonian '' , we will introduce the basic principle of the scheme for reverse engineering of a hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators . in the section of `` the population transfer for a rydberg atom ''",
    ", we will show an example using the present scheme to realize the population transfer for a rydberg atom .",
    "finally , conclusions will be given in the section of `` conclusion '' .",
    "we begin to introduce the basic method of the scheme for reverse engineering of a hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators .",
    "firstly , we suppose that the system evolves along the state @xmath2 and the initial state of the system is @xmath3 .",
    "so , the condition @xmath4 should be satisfied .",
    "we can obtain a complete orthogonal basis @xmath5 through a process of completion and orthogonalization .",
    "therefore , the vectors in basis @xmath5 satisfy the orthogonality condition @xmath6 and the completeness condition @xmath7 .",
    "since the system evolves along @xmath2 , the evolution operator can be designed as @xmath8 where parameters @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are chosen to satisfy the unitary condition @xmath11 . submitting the unitary condition into eq .",
    "( [ bm1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath12    secondly , according to schrdinger equation ( @xmath13 ) , we have @xmath14 on account of the arbitrariness of @xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ bm3 ] ) can be written by @xmath15 the hamiltonian can be formally solved from eq .",
    "( [ bm4 ] ) , and be given as @xmath16 by submitting eq .",
    "( [ bm2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ bm5 ] ) , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ bm5 ] ) can be described as @xmath17 different from tqd , which gives hamiltonian in the following from @xmath18 the present scheme has more free parameters @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , this scheme may construct some new and different hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , when parameters @xmath19 ( @xmath10 ) are independent of time , eq .  ( [ bm6 ] ) will degenerate into eq .",
    "( [ bm7 ] ) , which shows that the present scheme contains the results of tqd . on the other hand ,",
    "once the unitary condition @xmath11 for evolution operator is satisfied , the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ bm6 ] ) should be a hermitian operator , because @xmath20    as an extension , for a @xmath21-dimension system ( @xmath22 ) , the evolution operator can be designed as @xmath23 then , the initial state @xmath3 of the system can be expressed by the superposition of @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the system can evolve along more than one moving states in this case .",
    "this might sometimes help us to simplify the design of the system s hamiltonian .",
    "for the sake of clearness , we give an example to emphasize the advantages of the scheme . here",
    ", we consider a rydberg atom with the energy levels shown in fig .",
    "the transition between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is hard to realize .",
    "so , the hamiltonian of the rydberg atom is usually written as the following form @xmath28 where , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the rabi frequencies of laser pulses , which drive the transitions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and they are @xmath33-dephased from each other .",
    "suppose the initial state of the three - energy - level rydberg atom is @xmath26 , the target state is @xmath34 .",
    "we choose a complete orthogonal basis as below    @xmath35 ) , the evolution operator can take this form @xmath36 according to eq .",
    "( [ bm6 ] ) , the evolution operator in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) gives the following hamiltonian @xmath37 for simplicity , we set @xmath38 here , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) can be written by @xmath39 here , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) is already a hermitian operator . to eliminate the terms with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are difficult to realize for the three - energy - level rydberg atom , we set @xmath42 .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) will be changed into @xmath43    for simplicity , we suppose the initial time is @xmath44 and the final time is @xmath45 , so @xmath46 is the total interaction time . to satisfy the boundary conditions",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and avoid the singularity of hamiltonian , we choose the parameters as @xmath52,\\cr\\cr & & \\dot{\\beta}(t)=\\frac{\\pi a}{t}\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi t}{t}),\\cr\\cr & & \\dot{\\alpha}(t)=\\frac{8\\mu}{3t}\\sin^4(\\frac{\\pi t}{t}),\\cr\\cr & & \\alpha(t)=\\mu\\frac{t}{t}-\\frac{2\\mu}{3\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi t}{t})+\\frac{\\mu}{12\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi t}{t}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is an arbitrary constant . then , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "( [ e7 ] ) should not be too large .",
    "noticing that , with @xmath53 increasing , @xmath57 increases while @xmath58 decreases .",
    "therefore , to obtain a relatively small @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath53 should be neither too large nor too small .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath61 here .",
    "however , we can see from eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) that the functions of rabi frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 are too complex for experimental realization .",
    "fortunately , we can solve the problem by using simple functions to make a curve fitting for the @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "as an example , @xmath64 is taken here .",
    "we use @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the following , which are linear superposition of the gaussian or trigonometric functions , to make a curve fitting for the @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath67.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    to compare the values of @xmath62 and @xmath70 , @xmath63 and @xmath71 , we plot @xmath55 and @xmath72 versus @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath61 in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) and plot @xmath56 and @xmath75 versus @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath61 in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) . from figs .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) , one can find that the curves of @xmath62 and @xmath70 ( @xmath63 and @xmath71 ) are well matched with each other .",
    "therefore , we may use @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) instead of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) to obtain the same effect . to test the effectiveness of the approximation by using @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) instead of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , a simulation for the varies of populations of states @xmath26 , @xmath76 and @xmath27 when the rydberg atom is driven by laser pulses with rabi frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 with parameters @xmath74 and @xmath61 , is shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) . we can see from fig .",
    "3 ( a ) that the evolution is consonant with the expectation coming from the evolution operator in eq .  ( [ e2 ] ) . as a comparison , a simulation for the varies of populations of states @xmath26 , @xmath76 and @xmath27 when the rydberg atom is driven by laser pulses with rabi frequencies @xmath65 and @xmath66 with parameters @xmath74 and @xmath61 , is shown in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) . as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) and fig .",
    "3 ( b ) , we can conclude that the approximation by using @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) instead of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is effective here .",
    "in addition , seen from fig .",
    "3 , the population of intermediate state @xmath76 reaches a peak value about 0.72 , because the system does not evolve along the dark state of the hamiltonian of the system but a nonadiabatic shortcut , which greatly reduces the total evolution time .",
    "since most of the parameters are hard to faultlessly achieve in experiment , that require us to investigate the variations in the parameters caused by the experimental imperfection .",
    "we would like to discuss the fidelity @xmath77 with the deviations @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 of total interaction time @xmath46 , rabi frequencies of laser pulses @xmath81 and @xmath82 being considered .",
    "firstly , we plot @xmath83 versus @xmath84 and @xmath85 with parameters @xmath74 and @xmath61 in fig .",
    "moreover , we calculate the exact values of the fidelities @xmath83 at some boundary points of fig .",
    "4 ( a ) and show the results in table i. according to table i and fig .",
    "4 ( a ) , we find that the final fidelity @xmath83 is still higher than 0.9822 even when the deviation @xmath86 . therefore , the realizing of the population transfer for a rydberg atom given in this paper is robust against deviations @xmath79 and @xmath80 of rabi frequencies @xmath81 and @xmath82 for laser pulses .",
    "secondly , we plot @xmath83 versus @xmath84 and @xmath87 with parameters @xmath74 and @xmath61 in fig .",
    "moreover , @xmath84 and @xmath88 with corresponding fidelity @xmath83 are shown in table ii . seen from table ii and fig .",
    "4 ( b ) , we obtain that the fidelity @xmath83 is still high than 0.9729 even when the deviation @xmath89 .",
    "so , the scheme is insensitive to deviations @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "thirdly , @xmath83 versus @xmath85 and @xmath87 with parameters @xmath74 and @xmath61 is plotted in fig .",
    "4 ( c ) . and @xmath85 and @xmath88 with corresponding fidelity @xmath83 are given in table iii .",
    "as indicated in table iii and fig .",
    "4 ( c ) , the fidelity @xmath83 is still high than 0.9588 even when the deviation @xmath90 . moreover , when deviations of @xmath80 and @xmath78 have the different signs ( one negative and one positive ) , the fidelity @xmath83 can still keep in a high level .",
    "hence , we can say the scheme suffers little from deviations @xmath80 and @xmath78 .",
    "fourthly , we discuss the fidelity @xmath83 when @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath78 are all considered .",
    "some samples are given in table iv .",
    "table iv shows that the fidelity @xmath83 is still with a high level when the three deviations @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath78 are all considered .",
    "moreover , in the worst case , when @xmath91 , the fidelity @xmath83 is still higher than 0.9469 .",
    "according to the analysis above , we summarize that , the scheme to realize the population transfer for a rydberg atom is robust against operational imperfection .    to prove that the present scheme can be used to speed up the system s evolution and construct the shortcut to adiabatic passages , we make a comparison between the present scheme and the fractional stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) method via dark state @xmath92 of hamiltonian shown in eq .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) . according to stirap method , by setting boundary condition",
    "@xmath93 one can design the rabi frequencies @xmath94 and @xmath95 as following @xmath96\\sin\\mu,\\cr\\cr & & \\omega_{23}(t)=\\omega_0\\exp[-(\\frac{t+t_0-t/2}{t_c})^2]+\\omega_0\\exp[-(\\frac{t - t_0-t/2}{t_c})^2]\\cos\\mu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 denotes the pulse amplitude , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are some related parameters . setting @xmath100 and @xmath101 , rabi frequencies @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath95 can well satisfy the boundary condition in eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "we plot fig . 5 to show the fidelity @xmath83 when the rydberg atom is driven by laser pulses with rabi frequencies @xmath94 and @xmath95 shown in eq .  ( [ e10 ] ) versus @xmath102",
    "a series of samples of @xmath102 and corresponding fidelity @xmath83 are shown in table v. from fig .",
    "5 and table v , we can see that , to meet the adiabatic condition and obtain a relatively high fidelity by using stirap method , one should take @xmath102 about 30 . moreover , when @xmath103 , the adiabatic condition is badly violated and the fidelity is only 0.5538 for stirap method . but for the present scheme , we can obtain @xmath104 while @xmath68 and @xmath69 . therefore , the evolution speed with the present scheme is faster a lot comparing with that using stirap method .",
    "it confirms that the present scheme can be used to speed up the system s evolution and construct the shortcut to adiabatic passages .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the present scheme can construct a hamiltonian with both fast evolution process and robustness against operational imperfection .    in the end , we discuss the fidelity @xmath83 is robust to the decoherence mechanisms . in this scheme ,",
    "the atomic spontaneous emission plays the major role .",
    "the evolution of the system can be described by a master equation in lindblad form as following @xmath105+\\sum\\limits_{l}[l_l\\rho l_l^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}(l_l^{\\dagger}l_l\\rho+\\rho l_l^{\\dagger}l_l)],\\ ] ] where , @xmath106 is the lindblad operator .",
    "there are two lindblad operators here .",
    "they are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , in which , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the atomic spontaneous emission coefficients for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "fidelity @xmath83 versus @xmath113 and @xmath114 is plotted in fig .",
    "6 . from fig",
    ". 6 , we can see that the fidelity @xmath83 decreases when @xmath109 and @xmath110 increase .",
    "when in the case of strong coupling @xmath115 , the influence caused by atomic spontaneous emission is little .",
    "for example , if @xmath116 , the fidelity is 0.9901 .",
    "even when @xmath117 , the fidelity is 0.9101 , still higher than 0.9 . with current experimental technology",
    ", it is easy to obtain a laser pulse with rabi frequency much larger than the atomic spontaneous emission coefficients .",
    "therefore , the population transfer for a rydberg atom with the reverse engineering scheme given here can be robustly realized .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed an effective and flexible scheme for reverse engineering of a hamiltonian by designing the evolution operators .",
    "different from tqd , the present scheme is focus on only one or parts of moving states in a @xmath0-dimension ( @xmath1 ) system .",
    "the numerical simulation has indicated that the present scheme not only contains the results of tqd , but also has more free parameters , which make this scheme more flexible . moreover",
    ", the new free parameters may help to eliminate the terms of hamiltonian which are hard to be realized practically .",
    "furthermore , owing to suitable choice of boundary conditions for parameters , by making a curve fitting , the complex rabi frequencies @xmath118 and @xmath119 of laser pulses can be respective superseded by rabi frequencies @xmath81 and @xmath82 expressed by the superpositions of the gaussian or trigonometric functions , which can be realized with current experimental technology . the example given in sec .",
    "iii has shown that the present scheme can design a hamiltonian to realize the population transfer for a rydberg atom successfully and the numerical simulation has shown that the scheme is fast and robustness against the operational imperfection and the decoherence mechanisms .",
    "therefore , the present scheme may be used to construct a hamiltonian which can be realized in experiments .",
