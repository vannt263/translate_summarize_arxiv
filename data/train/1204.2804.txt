    "consumers rely increasingly on user - generated online reviews to make , or reverse , purchase decisions  @xcite . accordingly",
    ", there appears to be widespread and growing concern among both businesses and the public  @xcite regarding the potential for posting _ deceptive opinion spam_fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic , to deceive the reader  @xcite .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , however , relatively little is known about the actual _ prevalence _ , or rate , of deception in online review communities , and less still is known about the factors that can influence it . on the one hand ,",
    "the relative ease of producing reviews , combined with the pressure for businesses , products , and services to be perceived in a positive light , might lead one to expect that a preponderance of online reviews are fake .",
    "one can argue , on the other hand , that a low rate of deception is required for review sites to serve any value .",
    "the focus of spam research in the context of online reviews has been primarily on _",
    "detection_. jindal and liu  @xcite , for example , train models using features based on the review text , reviewer , and product to identify _ duplicate _ opinions .",
    "yoo and gretzel  @xcite gather 40 truthful and 42 deceptive hotel reviews and , using a standard statistical test , manually compare the psychologically relevant linguistic differences between them .",
    "while useful , these approaches do not focus on the prevalence of deception in online reviews .    indeed ,",
    "empirical , scholarly studies of the prevalence of deceptive opinion spam have remained elusive .",
    "one reason is the difficulty in obtaining reliable _ gold - standard annotations _ for reviews , i.e. , trusted labels that tag each review as either truthful ( real ) or deceptive ( fake ) .",
    "one option for producing gold - standard labels , for example , would be to rely on the judgements of human annotators .",
    "recent studies , however , show that deceptive opinion spam is not easily identified by human readers  @xcite ; this is especially the case when considering the overtrusting nature of most human judges , a phenomenon referred to in the psychological deception literature as a _ truth bias _  @xcite . to help illustrate the non - trivial nature of identifying deceptive content , given below are two positive reviews of the hilton chicago hotel , one of which",
    "is truthful , and the other of which is deceptive opinion spam :    1 .    my husband and i stayed in the hilton chicago and had a very nice stay !",
    "the rooms were large and comfortable .",
    "the view of lake michigan from our room was gorgeous .",
    "room service was really good and quick , eating in the room looking at that view , awesome !",
    "the pool was really nice but we did nt get a chance to use it .",
    "great location for all of the downtown chicago attractions such as theaters and museums .",
    "very friendly staff and knowledgable , you ca nt go wrong staying here . \"",
    " we loved the hotel .",
    "when i see other posts about it being shabby i ca nt for the life of me figure out what they are talking about .",
    "rooms were large with two bathrooms , lobby was fabulous , pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym , staff was courteous . for us ,",
    "the location was great  across the street from grant park with a great view of buckingham fountain and close to all the museums and theatres .",
    "i m sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the magnificent mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location . got it for $ 105 on hotwire . what a bargain for such a nice hotel . \" 3 .",
    "the difficulty of detecting which of these reviews is fake is consistent with recent large meta - analyses demonstrating the inaccuracy of human judgments of deception , with accuracy rates typically near chance  @xcite . in particular , humans have a difficult time identifying deceptive messages from cues alone , and as such , it is not surprising that research on estimating the prevalence of deception ( see section  [ sec : implications ] ) has generally relied on self - report methods , even though such reports are difficult and expensive to obtain , especially in large - scale settings , e.g. , the web  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , self - report methods , such as diaries and large - scale surveys , have several methodological concerns , including social desirability bias and self - deception  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are considerable disincentives to revealing one s own deception in the case of online reviews , such as being permanently banned from a review portal , or harming a business s reputation .",
    "recently , automated approaches ( see section  [ sec : dec_class ] ) have emerged to reliably label reviews as truthful vs.  deceptive : ott et al .",
    "train an @xmath0-gram  based text classifier using a corpus of truthful and deceptive reviews  the former culled from online review communities and the latter generated using amazon mechanical turk ( http://www.mturk.com ) .",
    "their resulting classifier is nearly 90% accurate .",
    "_ in this work , we present a general framework ( see section  [ sec : frame ] ) for estimating the prevalence of deception in online review communities . _ given a classifier that distinguishes truthful from deceptive reviews ( like that described above ) , and inspired by studies of disease prevalence  @xcite , we propose a _ generative model of deception _ ( see section  [ sec : prev_model ] ) that jointly models the classifier s uncertainty as well as the ground - truth deceptiveness of each review .",
    "inference for this model , which we perform via gibbs sampling , allows us to estimate the prevalence of deception in the underlying review community , _ without relying on either self - reports or gold - standard annotations_.    _ we further propose a theoretical component to the framework based on signaling theory from economics  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : signal_theory ] ) and use it to reason about the factors that influence deception prevalence in online review communities . _ in our context , signaling theory interprets each review as a signal to the product s true , unknown quality ; thus , the goal of consumer reviews is to diminish the inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producer . very briefly , according to a signaling theory approach , deception prevalence should be a function of the costs and benefits that accrue from producing a fake review .",
    "we hypothesize that review communities with low signaling cost , such as communities that make it easy to post a review , and large benefits , such as highly trafficked sites , will exhibit more deceptive opinion spam than those with higher signaling costs , such as communities that establish additional requirements for posting reviews , and lower benefits , such as low site traffic .",
    "we apply our approach to the domain of hotel reviews .",
    "in particular , we examine hotels from the chicago area , restricting attention to * positive * reviews only , and instantiate the framework for six online review communities ( see section  [ sec : data ] ) : expedia ( http://www.expedia.com ) , hotels.com ( http://www.hotels.com ) , orbitz ( http://www.orbitz.com ) , priceline ( http://www.priceline.com ) , tripadvisor ( http://www.tripadvisor.com ) , and yelp ( http://www.yelp.com ) .",
    "we find first that the prevalence of deception indeed varies by community .",
    "however , because it is not possible to validate these estimates empirically ( i.e. , the gold - standard rate of deception in each community is unknown ) , we focus our discussion instead on the relative differences in the rate of deception between communities . here",
    ", the results confirm our hypotheses and suggest that deception is most prevalent in communities with a low signal cost .",
    "importantly , when measures are taken to increase a community s signal cost , we find dramatic reductions in our estimates of the rate of deception in that community .",
    "_ in this section , we propose a framework to estimate the prevalence , or rate , of deception among reviews in six online review communities .",
    "_ since reviews in these communities do not have gold - standard annotations of deceptiveness , and neither human judgements nor self - reports of deception are reliable in this setting ( see discussion in section  [ sec : intro ] ) , our framework instead estimates the rates of deception in these communities using the output of an imperfect , automated deception classifier .",
    "in particular , we utilize a supervised machine learning classifier , which has been shown recently by ott et al .",
    "@xcite to be nearly 90% accurate at detecting deceptive opinion spam in a class - balanced dataset .",
    "a similar framework has been used previously in studies of disease prevalence , in which gold - standard diagnostic testing is either too expensive , or impossible to perform  @xcite . in such cases , it is therefore necessary to _ estimate _ the prevalence of disease in the population using a combination of an imperfect diagnostic test , and estimates of the test s positive and negative recall rates .",
    "our proposed framework is summarized here , with each step discussed in greater detail in the corresponding section :    1 .   *",
    "data ( section  [ sec : data ] ) : * + assume given a set of labeled training reviews , @xmath1 , where , for each review @xmath2 , @xmath3 gives the review s label ( @xmath4 for truthful , @xmath5 for deceptive ) , and @xmath6 gives the review s feature vector representation , for some feature space of size @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , assume given a set of _ labeled truthful _",
    "development reviews , @xmath8 , and a set of _ unlabeled _ test reviews , @xmath9 .",
    "* deception classifier ( section  [ sec : dec_class ] ) : * + using the labeled training reviews , @xmath10 , learn a supervised deception classifier , @xmath11 .",
    "* classifier sensitivity and specificity ( section  [ sec : class_sens_and_spec ] ) : * + by cross - validation on @xmath10 , estimate the _ sensitivity _ ( deceptive recall ) of the deception classifier , @xmath12 , as : @xmath13 + then , use @xmath14 to estimate the _ specificity _ ( truthful recall ) of the deception classifier , @xmath12 , as : @xmath15 4 .   * prevalence models ( section  [ sec : prev_model ] ) : * + finally , use @xmath12 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and either the nave prevalence model ( section  [ sec : prev_model_naive ] ) , or the generative bayesian prevalence model ( section  [ sec : prev_model_bayes ] ) , to estimate the prevalence of deception , denoted @xmath18 , among reviews in @xmath19 .",
    "note that _ if we had gold - standard labels _",
    ", @xmath20 , the gold - standard prevalence of deception would be : @xmath21",
    "in section  [ sec : frame ] , we propose a framework to estimate the prevalence of deception in a group of reviews using only the output of a noisy deception classifier .",
    "central to this framework is the prevalence model , which models the uncertainty of the deception classifier , and ultimately produces the desired prevalence estimate . in this section ,",
    "we propose two competing prevalence models , which can be used interchangeably in our framework .",
    "the nave prevalence model ( nave ) estimates the prevalence of deception in a corpus of reviews by correcting the output of a noisy deception classifier according to the classifier s _ known _ performance characteristics .",
    "formally , for a given deception classifier , @xmath12 , let @xmath22 be the number of reviews in @xmath19 for which @xmath12 makes a positive prediction , i.e. , the number of reviews for which @xmath12 predicts _ deceptive_. also , let the sensitivity ( deceptive recall ) and specificity ( truthful recall ) of @xmath12 be given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "then , we can write the expectation of @xmath22 as : @xmath23 & = \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\frac{1}{n^{\\text{test } } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{x } \\in \\mathcal{d}^{\\text{test } } } \\delta[f(\\mathbf{x } ) = 1 ] \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\    & = \\frac{1}{n^{\\text{test } } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{x } \\in \\mathcal{d}^{\\text{test } } } \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\delta\\left[f(\\mathbf{x } ) = 1\\right ] \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\    & = \\eta \\pi^ * + ( 1 - \\theta)(1 - \\pi^ * ) , \\label{eqn : expect_f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the true ( latent ) rate of deception , and @xmath25 $ ] is the kronecker delta function , which is equal to @xmath5 when @xmath26 , and @xmath4 otherwise .",
    "if we rearrange equation  [ eqn : expect_f ] in terms of @xmath24 , and replace the expectation of @xmath22 with the observed value , we get the nave prevalence model estimator : @xmath27 intuitively , equation  [ eqn : naive_prev_est ] corrects the raw classifier output , given by @xmath22 , by subtracting from it the false positive rate , given by @xmath28 , and dividing the result by the difference between the true and false positive rates , given by @xmath29 .",
    "notice that when @xmath12 is an oracle , i.e. , when @xmath30 , the nave prevalence model estimate correctly reduces to the oracle rate given by @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath31 .       is observed , and depends on @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . ]",
    "unfortunately , the nave prevalence model estimate , @xmath35 , is not restricted to the range @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "specifically , it is negative when @xmath37 , and greater than @xmath5 when @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the nave prevalence model makes the unrealistic assumption that the estimates of the classifier s sensitivity ( @xmath16 ) and specificity ( @xmath17 ) , obtained using the procedure discussed in section  [ sec : class_sens_and_spec ] and appendix  [ app : class_sens_and_spec ] , are exact .",
    "the bayesian prevalence model ( bayes ) addresses these limitations by modeling the generative process through which deception occurs , or , equivalently , the joint probability distribution of the observed and latent data .",
    "in particular , bayes models the observed classifier output , the true ( latent ) rate of deception ( @xmath24 ) , as well as the classifier s true ( latent ) sensitivity ( @xmath32 ) and specificity ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "formally , bayes assumes that our data was generated according to the following generative story :    * sample the true rate of deception : @xmath39 * sample the classifier s true sensitivity : @xmath40 * sample the classifier s true specificity : @xmath41 * for each review @xmath2 : * * sample the ground - truth deception label : @xmath42 * * sample the classifier s output : @xmath43    the corresponding graphical model is given in plate notation in figure  [ fig : plate1 ] .",
    "notice that by placing beta prior distributions on @xmath24 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , bayes enables us to encode our prior knowledge about the true rate of deception , as well as our uncertainty about the estimates of the classifier s sensitivity and specificity .",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ sec : class_sens_and_spec ] .",
    "a similar model has been proposed by joseph et al .",
    "@xcite for studies of disease prevalence , in which it is necessary to estimate the prevalence of disease in a population given only an imperfect diagnostic test .",
    "however , that model samples the _ total number of true positives and false negatives _ , while our model samples the @xmath34 individually . accordingly",
    ", while pilot experiments confirm that the two models produce identical results , the generative story of our model , given above , is comparatively much more intuitive .",
    "while exact inference is intractable for the bayesian prevalence model , a popular alternative way of approximating the desired posterior distribution is with markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling , and more specifically gibbs sampling .",
    "gibbs sampling works by sampling each variable , in turn , from the conditional distribution of that variable given all other variables in the model . after repeating this procedure for a fixed number of iterations , the desired posterior distribution can be approximated from samples in the chain by : ( 1 ) discarding a number of initial _ burn - in _ iterations , and ( 2 ) since adjacent samples in the chain are often highly correlated , thinning the number of remaining samples according to a _",
    "sampling lag_.    the conditional distributions of each variable given the others can be derived from the joint distribution , which can be read directly from the graph .",
    "based on the graphical representation of bayes , given in figure  [ fig : plate1 ] , the joint distribution of the observed and latent variables is just : @xmath44 where each term is given according to the sampling distributions specified in the generative story in section  [ sec : prev_model_bayes ] .    a common technique to simplify the joint distribution , and the sampling process , is to integrate out ( collapse ) variables that do not need to be sampled .",
    "if we integrate out @xmath24 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 from equation  [ eqn : full_joint ] , we can derive a gibbs sampler that only needs to sample the @xmath34 s at each iteration .",
    "the resulting sampling equations , and the corresponding bayesian prevalence model estimate of the prevalence of deception , @xmath45 , are given in greater detail in appendix  [ app : bayes_inference ] .",

    "cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in terms of economic theory , the role of review communities is to reduce the inherent _ information asymmetry _",
    "@xcite between buyers and sellers in online marketplaces , by providing buyers with _ a priori _ knowledge of the underlying quality of the products being sold  @xcite .",
    "it follows that if reviews regularly failed to reduce this information asymmetry , or , worse , convey false information , then they would cease to be of value to the user .",
    "given that review communities _ are _ , in fact , valued by users  @xcite , it seems unlikely that the prevalence of deception among them is large .",
    "nonetheless , there is widespread concern about the prevalence of deception in online reviews , rightly or wrongly , and further , deceptive reviews can be cause for concern even in small quantities , e.g. , if they are _ concentrated _ in a single review community .",
    "we propose that by framing reviews as @xmath46voluntary communications that serve to convey information about the signaler  @xcite , we can reason about the factors underlying deception by manipulating the distinct _ signal costs _ associated with truthful vs.  deceptive reviews .    specifically , we claim that for a _ positive _ review to be posted in a given review community , there must be an incurred _ signal cost _ , that is _ increased _ by :    1 .   the * posting cost * for posting the review in a given review community , i.e. , whether users are required to purchase a product prior to reviewing it ( high cost ) or not ( low cost ) . some sites , for example , allow anyone to post reviews about any hotel , making the review cost effectively zero .",
    "other sites , however , require the purchase of the hotel room before a review can be written , raising the cost from zero to the price of the room .",
    "and _ decreased _ by :    1 .",
    "the * exposure benefit * of posting the review in that review community , i.e. , the benefit derived from other users reading the review , which is proportional to the size of the review community s audience . review sites with more traffic have greater exposure benefit .",
    "observe that both the posting cost and the exposure benefit depend entirely on the review community .",
    "an overview of these factors for each of the six review communities is given in table  [ table : comm_factors ] .",
    "based on the signal cost function just defined , we propose two hypotheses :    * _ hypothesis 1 _ : review communities that have low signal costs ( low posting requirements , high exposure ) , e.g. , tripadvisor and yelp , will have more deception than communities with high signal costs , e.g. , orbitz . * _ hypothesis 2 _ : increasing the signal cost will decrease the prevalence of deception .",
    "the framework described in section  [ sec : frame ] is instantiated for the six review communities introduced in section  [ sec : data ] . in particular , we first train our svm deception classifier following the procedure outlined in section  [ sec : dec_class ] .",
    "an important step when training svm classifiers is setting the cost parameter , @xmath47 .",
    "we set @xmath47 using a nested 5-fold cross - validation procedure , and choose the value that gives the best average _ balanced accuracy _ , defined as @xmath48 .",
    "we then estimate the classifier s sensitivity , specificity , and hyperparameters , using the procedure outlined in section  [ sec : class_sens_and_spec ] and appendix  [ app : class_sens_and_spec ] . based on those estimates",
    ", we then estimate the prevalence of deception among reviews in our test set using the nave and the bayesian prevalence models .",
    "gibbs sampling for the bayesian prevalence model is performed using equations  [ eqn : gibbs1 ] and  [ eqn : gibbs2 ] ( given in appendix  [ app : bayes_inference ] ) for 70,000 iterations , with a _ burn - in _ of 20,000 iterations , and a _ sampling lag _ of 50 .",
    "we use an uninformative ( uniform ) prior for @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "multiple runs are performed to verify the stability of the results .",
    "estimates of the prevalence of deception for six review communities over time , given by the nave prevalence model , appear in figure  [ fig : naive ] .",
    "blue graphs ( a  d ) correspond to communities with _ high _ posting cost ( see table  [ table : comm_factors ] ) , i.e. , communities for which you are required to book a hotel room before posting a review , while red graphs ( e  f ) correspond to communities with _ low _ posting cost , i.e. , communities that allow any user to post reviews for any hotel .    in agreement with _",
    "hypothesis 1 _ ( given in section  [ sec : signal_theory ] ) , it is clear from figure  [ fig : naive ] that deceptive opinion spam is decreasing or stationary over time for _ high _ posting cost review communities ( blue graphs , a ",
    "in contrast , review communities that allow any user to post reviews for any hotel , i.e. , _ low _ posting cost communities ( red graphs , e  f ) , are seeing _ growth _ in their rate of deceptive opinion spam .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in section  [ sec : prev_model_naive ] , we observe that the prevalence estimates produced by the nave prevalence model are often negative . this occurs when the rate at which the classifier makes positive predictions is below the classifier s estimated false positive rate , suggesting both that the estimated false positive rate of the classifier is perhaps _ overestimated _ , and that the classifier s estimated specificity ( truthful recall rate , given by @xmath17 ) is perhaps _",
    "underestimated_. we address this further in section  [ sec : assumptions_and_limitations ] .    the bayesian prevalence model , on the other hand , encodes the uncertainty in the estimated values of the classifier s sensitivity and specificity through two beta priors , and in particular their hyperparameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "estimates of the prevalence of deception for the six review communities over time , given by the bayesian prevalence model , appear in figure  [ fig : bayes ] .",
    "blue ( a  d ) and red ( e  f ) graphs , as before , correspond to communities with _ high _ and _ low _ posting costs , respectively .    in agreement with _",
    "hypothesis 1 _ ( section  [ sec : signal_theory ] ) , we again find that _ low _ signal cost communities , e.g. , tripadvisor , seem to contain larger quantities and accelerated growth of deceptive opinion spam when compared to _",
    "high _ signal cost communities , e.g. , orbitz .",
    "interestingly , communities with a blend of signal costs appear to have medium rates of deception that are neither growing nor declining , e.g. , hotels.com , which has a rate of deception of @xmath52 .    to test _ hypothesis 2 _ , i.e. , that increasing the signal cost will decrease the prevalence of deception , we need to _ increase _ the signal cost , as we have defined it in section  [ sec : signal_theory ] .",
    "thus , it is necessary to either _ increase _ the posting cost , or _",
    "decrease _ the exposure benefit . and",
    "while we have no control over a community s exposure benefit , we _ can _ increase the posting cost by , for example , hiding all reviews written by users who have not posted at least two reviews .",
    "essentially , by requiring users to post more than one review in order for their review to be displayed , we are increasing the posting cost and , accordingly , the signal cost as well .",
    "bayesian prevalence model estimates for tripadvisor for varying signal costs appear in figure  [ fig : signalcost ] .",
    "in particular , we give the estimated prevalence of deception over time after removing reviews written by first - time review writers , and after removing reviews written by first- or second - time review writers . in agreement with _ hypothesis 2 _ , we see a clear reduction in the prevalence of deception over time on tripadvisor after removing these reviews , with rates dropping from @xmath53 , to @xmath54 , and finally to @xmath55 , suggesting that an increased signal cost may indeed help to reduce the prevalence of deception in online review communities .      in this work we have made a number of assumptions , a few of which we will now highlight and discuss .",
    "first , we note that our unlabeled test set , @xmath19 , overlaps with our labeled truthful training set , @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , we will _ underestimate _ the prevalence of deception , because the overlapping reviews will be more likely to be classified at test time as truthful , having been seen in training as being truthful . excluding these overlapping reviews from the test set results in _ overestimating _ the prevalence of deception , based on the hypothesis that the overlapping reviews , chosen from the 20 most highly - reviewed chicago hotels , are more likely to be truthful to begin with .",
    "second , we observe that our development set , @xmath14 , containing _ labeled truthful _",
    "reviews , is not gold - standard .",
    "unfortunately , while it is necessary to obtain a uniform sample of reviews in order to fairly estimate the classifier s truthful recall rate ( _ specificity _ ) , such review samples are inherently unlabeled .",
    "this can be problematic if the underlying rate of deception is high among the reviews from which the development set is sampled , because the specificity will then be _",
    "underestimated_. indeed , our nave prevalence model regularly produces negative estimates , suggesting that the estimated classifier specificity may indeed be underestimated , possibly due to deceptive reviews in the development set .",
    "third , our proposal for increasing the signal cost , by hiding reviews written by first- or second - time reviewers , is not ideal . while our results confirm that hiding these reviews will cause an immediate reduction in deception prevalence , the increase in signal cost might be insufficient to discourage new deception , once deceivers become aware of the increased posting requirements .",
    "fourth , in this work we have only considered a limited version of the deception prevalence problem . in particular , we have only considered positive chicago hotel reviews , and our classifier is trained on deceptive reviews coming only from amazon mechanical turk .",
    "both negative reviews as well as deceptive reviews obtained by other means are likely to be different in character than the data used in this study .",
    "the current research also represents a novel approach to a long - standing and ongoing debate around deception prevalence in the psychological literature . in one of the first large - scale studies looking at how often people lie in everyday communication , depaulo et al .",
    "@xcite used a diary method to calculate the average number of lies told per day . at the end of seven days participants told approximately one to two lies per day , with more recent studies replicating this general finding  @xcite , suggesting that deception is frequent in human communication .",
    "more recently , serota et al .",
    "@xcite conducted a large scale representative survey of americans asking participants how often they lied in the last 24 hours .",
    "while they found the same average deception rate as previous research ( approximately 1.65 lies per day ) , they discovered that the data was heavily skewed , with 60 percent of the participants reporting no lies at all .",
    "they concluded that rather than deception prevalence being spread evenly across the population , there are instead a few prolific liars .",
    "unfortunately , both sides of this debate have relied solely on self - report data .",
    "the current approach offers a novel method for assessing deception prevalence that does not require self - report , but can provide insight into the prevalence of deception in human communication more generally . at the same time , the question raised by the psychological research also mirrors an important point regarding the prevalence of deception in online reviews : are a few deceptive reviews posted by many people , or are there many deceptive reviews told by only a few ? that is ,",
    "do some hotels have many fake reviews while others are primarily honest ? or ,",
    "is there a little bit of cheating by most hotels ?",
    "this kind of individualized modeling represents an important next step in this line of research .",
    "in this work , we have presented a general framework for estimating the prevalence of deception in online review communities , based on the output of a noisy deception classifier . using this framework ,",
    "we have explored the prevalence of deception among positive reviews in six popular online review communities , and provided the first empirical study of the magnitude , and influencing factors of deceptive opinion spam .",
    "we have additionally proposed a theoretical model of online reviews as a signal to a product s true ( unknown ) quality , based on economic signaling theory .",
    "specifically , we have defined the signal cost of positive online reviews as a function of the posting costs and exposure benefits of the review community in which it is posted .",
    "based on this theory , we have further suggested two hypotheses , both of which are supported by our findings . in particular , we find first that review communities with low signal costs ( low posting requirements , high exposure ) have _ more deception _ than communities with comparatively higher signal costs .",
    "second , we find that by increasing the signal cost of a review community , e.g. , by excluding reviews written by first- or second - time reviewers , we can effectively reduce both the prevalence and the growth rate of deception in that community .",
    "future work might explore other methods for manipulating the signal costs associated with posting online reviews , and the corresponding effects on deception prevalence .",
    "for example , some sites , such as angie s list ( http://www.angieslist.com/ ) , charge a monthly access fee in order to browse or post reviews , and future work might study the effectiveness of such techniques at deterring deception .",
