    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) has become over the last decades a paradigmatic model in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is an example of a physical system exhibiting a macroscopic current in a stationary regime .",
    "such systems , which can not be described by the usual thermal equilibrium formalism , can be seen as the simplest out - of - equilibrium situation one can imagine @xcite .",
    "the large deviation function of the current is a key tool in the study of these systems , and has been proposed as a generalization of the traditional thermodynamic potentials to non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the large deviation function is studied via the generating function of the cumulants of the current , and several exact results have been obtained for the asep using a deformed current - counting transition matrix @xcite .",
    "these works build upon the matrix product method @xcite , used to compute the stationary state of the undeformed asep . in this work",
    "we continue in this vein , relying particularly on the integrability of the asep @xcite and the connection between integrability and the matrix product method @xcite .",
    "the integrable structure of the asep gives rise to a connection with hecke algebras , and macdonald and koornwinder polynomials @xcite .",
    "the macdonald polynomials are associated with the periodic system , and in @xcite this connection is exploited to derive a matrix product formula for the symmetric macdonald polynomials . in @xcite the connection between the open system and koornwinder polynomials is made  however a matrix product formula and the link to the general form of the koornwinder polynomials is still lacking .    the aim of this paper is to exploit the integrable structure of the asep with deformed current - counting matrix , to make a connection to the general form of the koornwinder polynomials .",
    "this in turns leads to a connection between the symmetric koornwinder polynomials and the generating function of the cumulants of the current .",
    "we do this by introducing scattering relations and @xmath1kz equations with a further deformation , through which we define a twice deformed ground state vector .",
    "we give a matrix product construction of this ground state vector and of the symmetric koornwinder polynomial associated with it .",
    "this leads us to conjecture a beautiful relation between the generating function of the cumulants of the current , and a certain limit of symmetric koornwinder polynomials .    in the following subsections we review briefly the main tools that are needed in this work : ( i ) the asep , the current - counting deformation of the associated markov matrix , and the link with the generating function of cumulants of the current , ( ii ) the hecke algebra and koornwinder polynomials , ( iii ) the integrable structure of the asep .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : twice_deformed ] , we introduce scattering relations and @xmath1kz equations , whose solutions define a twice deformed ground state vector . we point out the connection between components of this deformed ground state vector and non - symmetric koornwinder polynomials . in section [ sec : matrixproduct ]",
    "we construct solutions of the @xmath1kz equations in matrix product form , which then allows us to make the connection to symmetric koornwinder polynomials .",
    "finally in section [ sec : currentkoornwinder ] we conjecture that the twice deformed ground state vector converges in a specific limit to the ground state of the deformed markov matrix . this conjecture allows us to express the generating function of the cumulants of the current as a certain limit of symmetric koornwinder polynomials .",
    "the open boundary asep is a stochastic model of interacting particles set on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we consider a lattice of length @xmath2 , where each lattice site may be occupied by a single particle , or is empty . in the bulk of the lattice particles",
    "hop right one site with rate @xmath3 , and left with rate @xmath1 , so long as the target site is empty ( the exclusion rule ) . with open boundaries , particles may enter and exit at the first and last sites . if site @xmath4 is empty ( occupied ) , a particle is injected ( extracted ) with rate @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . at site @xmath2 , particles are extracted with rate @xmath6 and injected with rate @xmath7 .",
    "these rules , summarised in figure  [ fig : aseprules ] , describe a continuous time markov process .",
    "a markov process is defined by its transition matrix , and to give this matrix we must first specify a basis .",
    "to each site @xmath8 we attach a boolean variable @xmath9 indicating if the site is empty ( @xmath10 ) or occupied ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the state of a single site is represented by a vector @xmath12 , where @xmath13 the state of the lattice is given by a vector @xmath14 with @xmath15 the asep transition rates are then encoded in the transition matrix @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 the indices on the matrices indicate the sites on which they act . the matrix @xmath19 is stochastic only for @xmath20 , but the introduction of this fugacity allows the study of the current generating function , as will be discussed below .",
    "the stochastic matrix @xmath16 has a unique eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath21 , that is @xmath22 normalising this vector gives the stationary distribution of the system : letting @xmath23 the stationary probability of a configuration @xmath24 is @xmath25    if we now consider the deformed transition matrix @xmath19 , then the deformed ground state vector satisfies @xmath26 with @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath29 for general @xmath30 is an object of prime interest in the context of out - of - equilibrium statistical physics , because of its connection to the generating function of the cumulants of the current , @xmath31 .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that the cumulants of the current can be extracted analytically at any order at the price of solving non - linear implicit equations .",
    "the legendre transformation of @xmath32 provides the large deviation function of the particle current in the stationary state , @xmath33 which is expected to be a possible generalisation of thermodynamic potential to non - equilibrium systems @xcite . in words",
    ", @xmath34 describes the non - typical fluctuations of the mean particle flux .",
    "more precisely if we denote by @xmath35 the algebraic number of particles exchanged between the system and the left reservoir during the time interval @xmath36 $ ] , then @xmath34 is characterised by @xmath37 for large @xmath38 .",
    "the reader can refer , for instance , to @xcite for more details .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath29 is invariant under the gallavotti ",
    "@xcite @xmath39 this translates immediately into a symmetry on the large deviation function of the particle current .",
    "@xmath40 this symmetry arises from the relation between the transition matrix and its transpose : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is as defined in and @xmath43 the relation implies that @xmath19 and @xmath44 have the same spectrum and thus the largest eigenvalue is the same : @xmath45 as a further consequence of this symmetry , given a solution of the left eigenvalue problem @xmath46 there is a corresponding solution of the right eigenvalue problem @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath42 as defined in . note that here and in the following we use the convention @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the usual transposition .",
    "we will explain in the following sections the connection that can be made between the ground state @xmath51 and the theory of koornwinder polynomials that we present now .",
    "we now introduce the symmetric and non - symmetric koornwinder polynomials , which form the other main theme of this work .",
    "the symmetric koornwinder polynomials @xcite are a family of multivariate orthogonal polynomials generalising the askey",
    " wilson polynomials .",
    "the symmetric koornwinder polynomials can be constructed from their non - symmetric counterparts , which arise from the polynomial representation of the affine hecke algebra of type @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "the generators satisfy the quadratic relations , @xmath57 the braid relations @xmath58 and otherwise commute .",
    "that is @xmath59 the algebra contains a family of mutually commuting elements @xcite @xmath60    we are interested in the representation of this algebra due to noumi @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , acting on laurent polynomials in @xmath61 .",

    ".    then in the noumi representation , the generators of the affine hecke algebra are given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 one can check directly that the definitions satisfy the relations of the hecke algebra .",

    "the deformed transition matrix @xmath19 belongs to an infinite family of commuting matrices @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the generating function of these commuting matrices is called the transfer matrix . the key ingredients to construct this transfer matrix are matrices @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 satisfying the yang  baxter relation @xmath123 left and right reflection relations @xmath124 and the unitarity conditions @xmath125    for the open boundary asep",

    "all other components can be constructed through the relations @xmath297 the set of all components @xmath298 forms a basis for @xmath290 .",
    "this follows in the same way , with reference to theorem  [ theorem : phisol ] , and lemmas [ lemma : aseplefteigenref ] and [ lemma : leftqkzexchange ] .",

    "[ thm : symmetrickoornasnormalisation ] the sum of components of @xmath305 is the symmetric koornwinder polynomial @xmath306 .",
    "that is @xmath307 where @xmath308 and @xmath305 is the @xmath1kz solution with @xmath170 , constructed as in theorem  [ theorem : psisol ] .    by lemmas [ lemma : psibasis ] and [ lemma : zw0 ] ,",
    "@xmath309 is @xmath70 invariant , and belongs to the space @xmath290 , and from theorem  [ theorem : psisol ] , we see that it contains @xmath310 with coefficient 1 .",
    "the result then follows from the characterisation of symmetric koornwinder polynomials in @xcite , quoted in theorem  [ theorem : sahisymmetric ] .",
    "we note that theorem  [ thm : symmetrickoornasnormalisation ] implies a matrix product construction for the symmetric koornwinder polynomial @xmath311 .",
    "direct computations from this form would be difficult , but the structure leads to certain conjectures that we discuss in section  [ sec : currentkoornwinder ] .",
    "we also note that an integral form for the polynomial @xmath311 is already known @xcite .",
    "the solution of the left @xmath1kz equation is also related to the same symmetric koornwinder polynomial .    [",
    "thm : symmetrickoornasnormalisation2 ] the sum of components of @xmath312 is proportional to the symmetric koornwinder polynomial @xmath306 .",
    "that is @xmath313 where @xmath314 with @xmath315 .",
    "note that @xmath316 is the solution of the right @xmath1kz equations at @xmath42 , and the proof follows as in theorem  [ thm : symmetrickoornasnormalisation ] .",
    "however , because of the structure of the components @xmath317 ( see theorem  [ theorem : phisol ] and appendix  [ app : leftgroundstate ] ) , and the multiplication by matrix @xmath135 , the coefficient of @xmath310 in @xmath318 is not 1 .",
    "thus the identification with @xmath311 can only be made up to normalisation .",
    "the aim of this section is to make contact between the machinery developed previously , and the generating function of the cumulants of the current .",
    "the idea is quite simple and arises from the following observation : the constraint @xmath319 that was imposed in order to solve the @xmath1kz equations , can be satisfied by setting @xmath320 , leaving @xmath30 free instead of @xmath108 , which then implies @xmath153 as @xmath321 .",
    "it appears then natural to think that the scattering relation may degenerate , in this @xmath153 limit , to an eigenvector equation .",
    "then as @xmath321 , the vector @xmath322 should thus converge in some sense to an eigenvector of the scattering matrix . to move towards this direction ,",
    "we make the following conjectures .",
    "it is conjectured that @xmath323 with @xmath324 and @xmath325 regular functions of @xmath281 .",
    "these conjectures are supported by strong numerical evidences ( up to 3 sites ) and by the fact that the matrix product construction of @xmath218 is similar to the one presented in @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the authors developed a method called the `` perturbative matrix ansatz '' , which allowed them to approximate the ground state of @xmath19 , at any order in the current counting parameter @xmath30 .",
    "let us also mention that these kind of results have already been observed in the context of @xmath1kz equations of different models , and are known as the `` quasi - classical '' limit @xcite .",
    "note that the second part of the conjecture can be immediately rewritten in terms of symmetric koornwinder polynomials as @xmath326    in the following these conjectures will be considered as facts and properties will be deduced from them .",
    "but one has to keep in mind that the validity of the deduced results relies obviously on the validity of these conjectures .",
    "the function @xmath327 is @xmath70 invariant and its derivative , with respect to any of the @xmath66 , is invariant under the gallavotti - cohen symmetry @xmath328 .",
    "the @xmath70 invariance directly follows from the @xmath70 invariance of the symmetric koornwinder polynomials .",
    "the gallavotti - cohen symmetry follows from theorems [ thm : symmetrickoornasnormalisation ] and [ thm : symmetrickoornasnormalisation2 ] which give that @xmath329 with a proportionality coefficient independent of @xmath281 . taking the large @xmath259 limit it translates into the fact that @xmath330 with @xmath82 a constant term independent of @xmath281 , which concludes the proof .    in the following",
    "we will specify when needed the dependence on @xmath108 and @xmath30 of the scattering matrix @xmath331 defined in .",
    "the vector @xmath332 is an eigenvector of the scattering matrices evaluated at @xmath146 , with @xmath333    our starting point is the scattering relation applied with @xmath320 .",
    "we divide by @xmath334 to obtain @xmath335 we then have the limits @xmath336 which yield the desired result .",
    "the vector @xmath337 is an eigenvector of the deformed markov matrix , with @xmath338 this implies immediately the following expression for the generating function of the cumulants of the current : @xmath339    this is proven by taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath66 and then setting @xmath340 .",
    "one has to make basic use of the properties given in , and notice the fact that @xmath341 because @xmath325 is @xmath70 invariant .    note that despite revealing a beautiful connection between the symmetric functions and the fluctuations of the current , in practice , the last expression does not help to compute the cumulants of the current because a closed expression for @xmath325 is missing .",
    "however a step can be made toward an exact expression of @xmath325 , using the characterization of the symmetric koornwinder polynomials as eigenfunctions of the finite difference operator @xmath342 defined in .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath343 of this operator associated to the symmetric koornwinder polynomial @xmath311 is given for @xmath320 by @xmath344 it is straightforward to check that @xmath345 is invariant under the gallavotti - cohen symmetry , that is @xmath346 .    in the following",
    "we will explicitly write the dependence on @xmath108 of the functions @xmath347 defined in .",
    "we have the following characterization of the function @xmath325 : @xmath348   + \\sum_{i=1}^{n } g_i(\\mathbf{x}^{-1};1)\\left[\\exp\\left(- x_i \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial x_i}(\\mathbf{x};\\xi)\\right)-1\\right ] \\\\   & & = d_0(\\xi)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this follows directly from the relation applied for the symmetric koornwinder polynomial @xmath311 and @xmath320 . dividing the latter relation by @xmath349 and taking the large @xmath259 limit yield the desired result",
    ".    it would be interesting to understand if this characterization of the function @xmath325 can be related to a baxter @xmath350 relation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the normalisation of the stationary state ( corresponding to the case @xmath351 ) satisfies a @xmath350 difference equation .",
    "we can mention also in this context the work @xcite where the authors constructed a baxter q operator for the open asep ( with current - counting deformation ) and derived the corresponding @xmath350 relations .",
    "we would like to warmly thank nicolas cramp and eric ragoucy for stimulating discussions and suggestions .",
    "we wish to show that the normalisation factor @xmath219 , defined in , is non - zero . to do so we show how it is computed in the infinite dimensional representation of the algebra given in definition  [ def : oscalg ] .",
    "our presentation of the representation follows the review in @xcite , and we refer to that work for further references .    the representation of the algebra is defined on the fock space @xmath352 .",
    "the bulk matrices are given by @xmath353 the boundary vectors are written @xmath354 and @xmath355 as a consequence of the boundary relations , the coefficients appearing in @xmath204 , @xmath205 satisfy the recursion relations @xmath356 with @xmath357 .",
    "we have used the @xmath358-pochhammer symbol @xmath359 the @xmath358-pochhammer symbol can be defined for @xmath360 if @xmath361 , then @xmath362 and we use the notation @xmath363 the @xmath358-hermite polynomials are given by @xmath364 and satisfy the recursion relation @xmath365 thus we find @xmath366 the coefficients @xmath367 , @xmath368 are obtained by setting @xmath369 in the above .    to compute the normalisation factors in the @xmath1kz solution",
    ", we will make use of the @xmath358-mehler formula @xmath370 for the normalisation , we need to compute @xmath371 using the coefficients and the @xmath358-mehler formula gives @xmath372 we also need to compute @xmath373 , but this is obtained from by setting @xmath369 , @xmath374 .",
    "in this appendix , we construct row vector solutions of the _ left _ @xmath1kz equations  in the matrix product form @xmath375 with @xmath376      we will construct a solution at @xmath170 , with @xmath103 an integer . we define the following objects : @xmath378 the algebraic objects are as given in definition  [ def : oscalg ] , and @xmath213 is defined in .          with this result ,",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem : phisol ] is then very similar to that for theorem  [ theorem : psisol ] .",
    "we will , however , comment briefly on the terms appearing in each component @xmath385 , and the normalisation . to do so , we look at the normalised ` increment matrix ' taking the @xmath266 solution to the @xmath259 solution : @xmath386 the diagonal entries of this matrix contain the term @xmath387 with coefficient @xmath4 , which produce the term @xmath276 in @xmath317 . in the top row of the increment matrix , the entry in column @xmath388 has leading term @xmath389 and as a consequence , each component @xmath317 contains the term @xmath310 with the same coefficient as in .",
