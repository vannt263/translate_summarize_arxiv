    "in addition , mullen conjectured the bound @xmath18 for non - permutation polynomials .",
    "this was proven by wan in @xcite using @xmath0-adic liftings , but turnwald later averted the use of liftings with a clever proof in @xcite using elementary symmetric polynomials .",
    "this bound was also proven sharp for any finite field by cusick and m@xmath19ller ( for @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 for all integers @xmath22 , see @xcite ) . for more sharp examples ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "despite the interest mathematicians have taken in the value set problem , most of the work in this area has been dedicated towards univariate polynomials . however , in the past 25 or so years , the multivariate value set problem has been addressed in a few different forms .",
    "it was first addressed by serre in 1988 @xcite over varieties , in connection with hilbert s irreducibility theorem and the inverse galois problem .",
    "his theorem , alongside results by fried @xcite and by guralnick and wan @xcite give us upper bounds on our value set which generalize cohen s result in ( [ cohen ] ) . though these results bound @xmath23 by some fraction of @xmath24 , it is important to note that the error terms in both results , though well behaved with respect to @xmath25 , are unpredictable in terms of the degree @xmath10 of the map .",
    "a recently published paper by mullen , wan , and wang ( see @xcite ) gives another bound on the value set of polynomial maps , one with no error terms : @xmath26 in this paper , we set out to improve upon the above result by generalizing wan s @xmath0-adic lifting approach and utilizing the newton polytope of the multivariate polynomial .",
    "we define a quantity @xmath27 in section [ newpoly ] based on the newton polytope , one which has the property @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the result is as follows :    let @xmath29 be a polynomial vector over the vector space @xmath30 . @xmath31",
    "let @xmath32 be an arbitrary field and let @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "if we write @xmath34 in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 then we have the following definition :    the newton polytope of polynomial @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath37 , is the convex closure of the set @xmath38 in @xmath39 .",
    "geometric properties of the newton polytope , such as its dilation by @xmath40 , its volume or its decomposition into other polytopes via minkowski sum , are useful tools in discerning properties of their associated polynomials . for more information ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the significance of the newton polytope to the multivariate value set problem comes from the definition of the following quantity :    let @xmath32 be a field , let @xmath33 $ ] , and let @xmath37 be the newton polytope of @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath41    in other words , @xmath42 is the infimum of all positive real numbers @xmath22 such that the dilation of @xmath37 by @xmath22 contains a lattice point with strictly positive coordinates , and we define @xmath43 if such a dilation does not exist . for our purposes , since the vertices of our polytopes have integer coordinates , @xmath42 will always be finite and rational so long as we consider @xmath34 which is not a polynomial in some proper subset of @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity is used by adolphson and sperber @xcite to put a lower bound on the @xmath25-adic valuation ord@xmath45 of the number of @xmath2-rational points on a variety @xmath46 , @xmath47 , over @xmath2 .",

    "however , for the value set problem , we are interested in studying the polynomial vector @xmath54 . fortunately , the definitions we have developed in this section can be extended to polynomial vectors . to properly motivate how this extension arises in our theorem , let us first understand the proof of the univariate result given in ( [ singlewan ] ) and discern how to generalize to the multivariate case in section [ from2 ] .",

    "@xmath56 $ ] of @xmath5 , taking coefficients from the teichm@xmath19ller lifting @xmath57 @xmath58 of @xmath2 .",
    "then we define @xmath59 to be the smallest positive integer @xmath22 such that the sum @xmath60    by taking into account the following sum , @xmath61 and remembering that we are only summing over a finite number of terms , we have the following inequality for @xmath5 not identically zero :    @xmath62 with the above inequality in mind , theorem [ singlevar ] will follow directly from the following lemma :    [ ulemma ] if @xmath63 , then @xmath64    the proof of this result is given in the paper by mullen , wan , and wang .",

    "now , take a basis @xmath66 of @xmath67 over @xmath2 .",

    "therefore , using lemma  [ ulemma ] , we know @xmath72 where @xmath70 is viewed as a univariate polynomial .    unfortunately , as a univariate polynomial , we do not have good control of the univariate degree of @xmath70 in relation to the multivariate degree of @xmath5 .",
    "even if one were to construct a closed form for @xmath73 using methods such as lagrange interpolation , the degree of @xmath70 would likely be high enough as to make the resulting upper bound on @xmath23 trivial .",
    "because of these issues with the degree of @xmath70 , we can not use the bounds from the previous section directly , and must rely on another method to bound @xmath74 .",

    "viewing @xmath70 as a univariate polynomial @xmath73 , we are allowed to apply lemma  [ ulemma ] to bound @xmath23 using @xmath74 .",
    "we then consider @xmath70 as multivariate @xmath77 , which allows us to define @xmath82 and @xmath83 . noting that @xmath84 and @xmath85 by our definition in section [ from2 ]",
    ", it suffices to prove the following lemma on @xmath74 :      assume the coefficients of @xmath77 are lifted to characteristic zero over @xmath87 , our teichm@xmath19ller lifting of @xmath67 .",
    "remember that @xmath74 is defined over univariate polynomials to be the smallest positive integer @xmath22 such that @xmath88 however , using @xmath68 as in section [ from2 ] , we can rewrite @xmath89 in terms of multivariate @xmath77 .",
    "this means @xmath74 is the smallest positive integer @xmath22 such that @xmath90    let @xmath91 be such that @xmath92 expand @xmath93 as a polynomial in the @xmath94 variables @xmath95 ( see @xmath96 ) . since @xmath89 is a finite sum , it can be broken up over the monomials of @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to prove @xmath98 if we denote @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 denotes the number of nonzero @xmath101 s with @xmath102 , then we have exactly @xmath103 zero @xmath101 s , implying that @xmath104 now let @xmath105 denote the @xmath0-adic valuation satisfying @xmath106 .",
    "if the inequality @xmath107 is satisfied , then ( [ xvjsum ] ) is true and we are done .    considering @xmath108 , the sum on the left side is identically zero if one of the @xmath101 is not divisible by @xmath109 ( see ( [ charsum ] ) ) .",

    "but since @xmath115 , we have that @xmath116 as well .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath117 has no zero coordinates , i.e. @xmath118 , this implies @xmath119 this statement tells us , by the definition of @xmath27 , that @xmath120 . in other words , @xmath121 this contradicts our assumption that @xmath122    therefore , when @xmath123 we have that @xmath124 , and @xmath125 this case , since @xmath126 gives us @xmath127 and @xmath128 this implies that @xmath129 and we are done .",
