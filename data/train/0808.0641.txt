    "massive stars play an important role in the evolution of the universe particularly in the late stages of their evolution . through their strong stellar winds and supernova explosions ,",
    "they inject mechanical energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite . also , they are principal sources of heavy elements in the ism . in spite of their importance ,",
    "our understanding of late stages of massive stars evolution is still poor .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that massive stars are extremely rare partly because of their short lifetime . due to their small numbers , the properties of evolved massive stars are still uncertain . for instance , as discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ", there was a discrepancy between observed and theoretically predicted locations of red supergiants , high - mass evolved stars , on the hertzsprung - russel ( hr ) diagram . compared with stellar evolutionary models , observed red supergiants appear to be too cool and too luminous .",
    "vy canis majoris ( vy cma ) is one of the most well - studied red supergiants .",
    "similar to other red supergiants , the location of vy cma on the hr diagram is also uncertain .",
    "for instance , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite obtained the luminosity of ( 25 ) @xmath3 10@xmath4 l@xmath5 from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) assuming the distance of 1.5 kpc @xcite and effective temperature of 28003000 k based on the stellar spectral type @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the above parameters would make vy cma cooler and more luminous than what current evolutionary models allow and would place it in the  forbidden zone \" of the hr diagram , which is on the right - hand side of the hayashi track in the hr diagram ( see figure [ fig : hrdthis ] ) .",
    "@xcite reexamined the effective temperature and obtained a new value of 3650 @xmath1 25 k based on optical spectrophotometry combined with a stellar atmosphere model and suggested that the luminosity of vy cma is only 6.0 @xmath3 10@xmath6 l@xmath5 , which is probably a lower limit @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the effective temperatures of 74 galactic red supergiants based on optical spectrophotometry and stellar atmosphere models .",
    "they obtained the effective temperatures of the red supergiants with a precision of 50 k. their new effective temperatures are warmer than those in the literature .",
    "these new effective temperature values seem to be consistent with the theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks . however , the luminosities of the red supergiants still had large uncertainty due to possible errors in estimated distances .",
    "since most of red supergiants are very far , it has been difficult to apply the most reliable trigonometric parallax method to their distance measurements .    in the case of vy cma ,",
    "the currently accepted distance of 1.5 kpc @xcite is obtained by assuming that vy cma is a member of the ngc 2362 star cluster and that the distance of ngc 2362 is same as that of vy cma .",
    "the distance to the ngc 2362 was determined from the color - magnitude diagram @xcite with an accuracy of no better than 30 % .",
    "since the luminosity depends on the square of the distance , the accuracy of luminosity estimation is worse than 50 % .",
    "the proper motions measured with h@xmath0o masers in previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have not been contradictory to the above distance value ( 1.5 kpc ) .",
    "when the h@xmath0o maser region around a star is modeled with a symmetrically expanding spherical shell , the distance to the star from the sun can be inferred by assuming that the observed mean proper motion multiplied by the distance should be equal to the observed mean radial velocity of the h@xmath0o masers .",
    "the proper motion velocities in @xcite are well consistent with the h@xmath0o maser spectral line velocities at the distance of 1.5 kpc . also , @xcite derived the distance of vy cma to be 1.4 @xmath1 0.2 kpc .",
    "however , such a `` statistical parallax '' method depends on kinematical models fitted to the observed relative proper motions .",
    "in fact , if we add rotation or anisotropic expansion to the simple spherical expansion model , the inferred distance value could vary beyond quoted error ranges .",
    "an accurate distance determination without an assumption is crucial for obtaining the right location of vy cma on the hr diagram and for determining fundamental parameters of the star .",
    "thanks to the recent progress in the vlbi technique , the distance measurements with trigonometric parallaxes have become possible even beyond 5 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since vy cma has strong maser emission in its circumstellar envelope , we have conducted an astrometric observations of h@xmath0o masers around vy cma to measure an accurate parallax with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) and here we present the results .",
    "we have observed h@xmath0o masers ( h@xmath0o 6@xmath75@xmath8 transition at the rest frequency of 22.235080 ghz ) in the red supergiant vy cma with vera at 10 epochs over 13 months .",
    "the epochs are april 24 , may 24 , september 2 , october 30 , november 27 in 2006 , january 10 , february 14 , march 26 , april 21 and may 27 in 2007 ( day of year 114 , 144 , 245 , 303 , 331 in 2006 , 010 , 045 , 085 , 111 and 147 in 2007 , respectively ) . in each epoch , vy cma and a position reference source j07252640 [ @xmath9(j2000 ) = 07h25m24.413135s , @xmath10(j2000 ) = 26d4032.67907 \" in vcs 5 catalog , @xcite ] were observed simultaneously in dual - beam mode for about 7 hours .",
    "the separation angle between vy cma and j07252640 is 1.059 degrees .",
    "the instrumental phase difference between the two beams was measured at each station during the observations based on the correlations of artificial noise sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a bright continuum source ( da193 at 1st3rd epochs and j0530 + 1330 at other epochs ) was observed every 80 minutes for bandpass and delay calibration at each beam .",
    "left - handed circularly polarized signals were sampled with 2-bit quantization and filtered with the vera digital filter unit @xcite .",
    "the data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a rate of 1024 mbps , providing a total bandwidth of 256 mhz which consists of 16 @xmath3 16 mhz if channels .",
    "one if channel was assigned to the h@xmath0o masers in vy cma and the other 15 if channels were assigned to j07252640 , respectively .",
    "the correlation processing was carried out on the mitaka fx correlator @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution for h@xmath0o maser lines is 15.625 khz , corresponding to the velocity resolution of 0.21 km s@xmath11 .",
    "all data reduction was conducted using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "the amplitude and the bandpass calibration for target source ( vy cma ) and reference source ( j07252640 ) were performed independently .",
    "the amplitude calibration of each antenna was performed using system temperatures measured during observation .",
    "the bandpass calibration was applied using a bright continuum source ( da193 at 1st3rd epochs and j0530 + 1330 at other epochs ) .",
    "doppler corrections were carried out to obtain the radial motions of the h@xmath0o masers relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "then , we calibrated the clock parameters using the residual delay of a bright continuum calibrator , which is also used for the bandpass calibration .",
    "the fringe fitting was made on the position reference source j07252640 with integration time of 2 minutes and time interval of 12 seconds to obtain residual delays , rates , and phases .",
    "these phase solutions were applied to the target source vy cma and we also applied the dual - beam phase calibration @xcite to correct the instrumental delay difference between the two beams .",
    "we calibrated the tropospheric zenith delay offset by using the gps measurements of the tropospheric zenith delay made at each station @xcite .",
    "after these calibrations , synthesized clean images were obtained . a typical synthesized beam size ( fwhm )",
    "was 2 mas @xmath3 1 mas with a position angle of 23@xmath12 .",
    "we measured positions of the h@xmath0o maser features relative to the extragalactic source j07252640 with two - dimensional gaussian fitting .",
    "( 75mm,75mm)figure1original.eps    the autocorrelation spectrum of the h@xmath0o masers around vy cma is shown in figure [ fig : kspectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum shows rich maser emission over lsr velocities ranging from 5 to 35 km s@xmath11 .",
    "though there are variations in flux density , overall structures of maser spectrum are common to all the epochs , indicating that maser spots are surviving over the observing period of 13 months .",
    "( 100mm,100mm)figure2.eps    to reveal the distribution of the h@xmath0o masers , we mapped the h@xmath0o maser features in vy cma at the first epoch ( april 24 , 2006 ) .",
    "we detected 55 maser features that have signal - to - noise ratio larger than 7 in two adjacent channels .",
    "the distribution of the h@xmath0o maser features is shown in figure [ fig : kmap ] .",
    "the most red - shifted component and the most blue - shifted component lie near the apparent center of the distribution and the moderately red - shifted components on a ne - sw line of 150 mas .",
    "this distribution well agrees with the previous observational results by @xcite .    among the h@xmath0o maser features in vy cma",
    ", one maser feature at a lsr velocity of about 0.55 km s@xmath11 is analyzed to detect an annual parallax .",
    "this feature , the most blue - shifted discrete component , is stably detected at all epochs .",
    "it is the third brightest maser component in the total - power spectrum , but in fact it is the second brightest component in the map .",
    "we note that while the brightest channel has multiple components , there is only one component in the channel at the lsr velocity of about 0.55 km s@xmath11 . because of the simple structure as well as its strength , this velocity channel is most suitable for astrometric measurements .",
    "analyses for the other h@xmath0o maser features will be reported in a forthcoming paper .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     ( 100mm,100mm)figure4.eps    the accurate distance measurements of red supergiants , which provide true luminosities , will greatly contribute to the understanding of massive star evolution , though there is still uncertainty in the effective temperature on the stellar surface .",
    "we have observed the h@xmath0o masers around the red supergiant vy cma with vera during 10 epochs spread over 13 months .",
    "simultaneous observations for both h@xmath0o masers around vy cma and the position reference source j07252640 were carried out .",
    "we measured a trigonometric parallax of 0.88 @xmath1 0.08 mas , corresponding to a distance of 1.14 @xmath2 kpc from the sun .",
    "it is the first result that the distance of vy cma is determined with an annual parallax measurement .",
    "there had been overestimation of the luminosities in previous studies due to the previously accepted distance .",
    "using the most accurate distance based on the trigonometric parallax measurements and the bolometric flux from the observed sed , we estimated the luminosity of vy cma to be ( 3 @xmath1 0.5 ) @xmath3 10@xmath4 l@xmath5 .",
    "the accurate distance measurements provided the improved luminosity .",
