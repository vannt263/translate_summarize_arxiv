    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a promising candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) which provides an elegant solution of the gauge hierarchy problem and is also endowed with various phenomenological virtues , including renowned gauge coupling unification .",
    "susy with r parity naturally introduces the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) as a candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "if gravitino is heavy enough , the best candidate is lsp neutralino . on the other hand precision cosmology in these decades",
    "has pinned down its abundance in the universe .",
    "this enables us to select realistic susy models via the nature of lsp and calculation of its relic abundance under plausible assumption on the evolution of the universe .",
    "this is particularly interesting in view of making contact between new physics search in lhc and direct / indirect detection of cold dark matter .",
    "recently , a new class of susy breaking scenario called mirage mediation has been proposed @xcite , which is also known as the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation . it is a generic consequence of the kklt - type moduli stabilization @xcite and its low energy susy spectrum is distinct from those of the conventional susy breaking scenarios such as minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , gauge mediation and anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "phenomenological and cosmological aspects of it have been investigated by several groups @xcite . in this paper , we summarize the results of our analysis on the thermal relic abundance of neutralino dark matter in mirage mediation and discuss prospects of its direct and indirect detections in ongoing and planned experiments .",
    "here we briefly summarize the mirage mediation .",
    "more detailed explanations are found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "mirage mediation is a natural consequence of the following two assumptions on moduli stabilization and susy breaking :    * gauge coupling modulus @xmath0 for visible gauge fields is stabilized by non - perturbative dynamics which does not break susy itself .",
    "* susy is broken by a brane - localized source which is sequestered from visible sector .    both of them",
    "are typically realized in kklt moduli stabilization in type iib string @xcite .",
    "small shift of the modulus vev by susy breaking uplifting leads to suppressed f - component relative to the gravitino mass @xcite , @xmath1 which gives mixed modulus - anomaly mediated patterns to the soft susy breaking terms at the unification scale , @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and tilde indicate modulus mediation and superscript @xmath5 denotes anomaly mediation .",
    "@xmath6 represents their interference .",
    "note @xmath7 and the two contributions are comparable .",
    "we introduce the following dimensionless parameters , @xmath8 @xmath9 is dynamically set real due to shift symmetry of @xmath0 and r symmetry @xcite . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are typically non - negative rational numbers , depending upon scaling property of the matter khler metric against @xmath12 . in toroidal compactification ,",
    "they are given by @xmath13 for matter fields with modular weight @xmath14 .",
    "a unique feature of the mirage mediation is the fact that the addition of anomaly mediation is equivalent to effective shift of the modulus mediation scale from @xmath2 to _ the mirage messenger scale _",
    ", @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this is true not only for gaugino masses but also for trilinear couplings and soft scalar masses if relevant yukawa couplings are negligible or only allowed for combination of @xmath16 .",
    "note that the unification scale of the gauge couplings itself remains the same .",
    "this leads to rather degenerate low energy spectrum distinct from msugra , gauge mediation or anomaly mediation and consequently its characteristic phenomenology .    in the case of neutralino dark matter ,",
    "reduced gluino / bino mass ratio , @xmath17 results in reduced higgsino and heavy higgs boson masses relative to the bino mass through the rg running under constraint of radiative electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking .",
    "this enhances higgsino components in the lightest neutralino and also increases a chance for neutralino to annihilate via heavy higgs boson resonance .",
    "if susy breaking sector is sequestered by warped throat as in the kklt moduli stabilization and gauge couplings are determined only by @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev are predicted .",
    "however , if we introduce dilaton - modulus mixing in gauge kinetic functions for visible gauge fields and/or non - perturbative dynamics of the modulus stabilization , the more varied value of @xmath9 is available @xcite . in the next section",
    "we first examine the minimal case @xmath20 and later extend it for general cases .",
    "in this section , we analyze the thermal relic abundance of the neutralino dark matter in mirage mediation and prospects of its direct and indirect detection .",
    "we assume that the universe undergoes standard thermal evolution during and after the decoupling of neutralino which occurs at a temperature , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lightest neutralino mass .",
    "for the numerical calculation of the abundance and various observables in direct / indirect detection , we extensively use the _ dark susy 4.1 _ package @xcite .",
    "the mirage mediation inherently involves a light modulus of @xmath23 . after the inflation",
    ", it is known that if displaced such a modulus starts coherent oscillation and eventually dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "its subsequent decays to gravitino and other mssm fields reheat the universe again . recently",
    ", this process is examined in detail and non - thermal neutralino from the decay of the gravitino is found to overclose the universe @xcite .",
    "we assume this non - thermal contribution is diluted before the universe reaches @xmath24 .",
    "such a dilution is possible by thermal inflation @xcite .    in figure [ minimal - aboundance ] , we present the thermal relic abundance of the neutralino in the minimal setup ( @xmath20 ) as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "left panel shows a case of universal modular weight @xmath26 which corresponds to d7 matter fields in the kklt setup @xcite , while right panel shows alternative choice , @xmath27 . within the magenta strip",
    ", the thermal abundance saturates the current wmap bound , @xmath28 @xmath29 and below it ( cyan region ) non - thermal contribution is required to fill the bound but allowed as well .",
    "green region is excluded due to stop lsp and gray region is excluded due to stau lsp .",
    "brown region is disfavored by @xmath30 branching ratio .",
    "we also eliminate a region in which the lightest higgs mass is below the current sm higgs mass bound .    in @xmath26 case ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is almost bino whose annihilation cross section is known to be small .",
    "however , annihilation through heavy higgs resonance ( @xmath31 ) and coannihilation with stop ( stau ) near the boundary of stop ( stau ) lsp region reduce the relic abundance and a relatively heavy @xmath4 region satisfies the wmap bound which evades the higgs and @xmath30 bounds . on the other hand , in @xmath27 case ,",
    "stop lsp region disappears due to reduction of the rg contribution through the top yukawa coupling .",
    "reduction of the higgs soft mass suppresses the heavy higgs masses and removes the resonance away .",
    "instead , it introduces non - negligible higgsino components in the lightest neutralino .",
    "this effect pushes up the wmap region to @xmath32 gev which is well above the higgs and @xmath30 bounds .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we briefly summarized the results of our analysis on thermal relic abundance and future prospects of direct and indirect detections of neutralino dark matter in mirage mediation .",
    "the abundance is reduced due to stop / stau coannihilation , heavy higgs resonance and enhanced higgsino components . the wmap bound can be satisfied in bulk of the parameter space .",
    "future direct experiments can detect mixed bino - higgsino dark matter which appears in non - minimal modular weight cases .",
    "indirect detection can explore the scenario if the galactic halo density has cuspy profile .",
