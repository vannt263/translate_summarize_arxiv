    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is difficult because it involves many different processes that are coupled in a complex way . in order to simulate a scenario properly",
    ", one has to consider the dynamics of stars , gas and dark matter as well as star formation , the interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and chemical enrichment @xcite . since this problem includes many unknown parameters , it is more effective to decouple various processes and to closely inspect observational constraints which are relevant to the different parameters .",
    "chemical evolution models constrain star formation histories , supernova rates , and abundances in the ism , in the stars , and in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "thus , trying to reproduce element abundances in chemical simulations already puts significant constraints on galaxy formation without considering complicated dynamical aspects .",
    "hence , in the present stage it is more effective to decouple the dynamical and the chemical approach .",
    "different timescales for the duration of the star forming phase cause different abundance ratios in the stars and in the ism . in short phases of star formation short - living ,",
    "massive stars govern the enrichment of the ism . thus ,",
    "in those formation scenarios the abundance ratios reflect the type ii supernova ( sn  ii ) production ( hashimoto , iwamoto , & nomoto 1993 ) .    in order to obtain the various element abundances in the solar neighbourhood , a modest and continuous star formation rate ( sfr )",
    "is necessary @xcite . in the standard models ( e.g.  matteucci & greggio 1986 ; timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ; tsujimoto et  al .",
    "1995 ) , this kind of star formation history is obtained with infall of primordial gas on a timescale of several gyr and an sfr which depends on the gas density via the schmidt - law @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the disk of the galaxy is assumed to form out of slowly accreting gas .",
    "since star formation occurs over a long timescale of @xmath1 yr , the chemical evolution is noticeably influenced by sn  ia .    in bulges and elliptical galaxies ,",
    "[ @xmath2/fe]-ratios seem to be enhanced with respect to solar abundances ( peletier 1989 ; worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ; davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ; mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) .",
    "since the @xmath2-elements are mainly produced in massive stars experiencing sn  ii explosions @xcite , and iron is substantially contributed by type ia supernovae ( sn  ia ) , the chemical history of the light dominating component of the stellar population in bulges and ellipticals must be dominated by massive stars . in chemical evolution models ,",
    "this can be realized by either @xcite    1 .   a flat imf or 2 .   a short phase of star formation or 3 .   a low fraction of close binary systems experiencing sn  ia",
    "chemical evolution models have to constrain and quantify these different possibilities .",
    "although in the pure chemical approach the number of input parameters is already reduced , there are still plenty of uncertainties in the calculations .",
    "typical input parameters are the shape and slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) , the sfr , the infall rate and the fraction of close binary systems producing iron via type  ia supernovae . however , chemical evolution is also very sensitive to the adopted stellar yields , especially of sn  ii ( see also gibson 1997 ) .",
    "thus , besides the parameters above , chemical evolution models should always take into account different stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions , which are strongly affected by uncertainties of stellar evolution models ( thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) .    in this paper , we compare two recently published nucleosynthesis calculations for sn  ii by :    1 .",
    "woosley & weaver , hereafter ww95 2 .",
    "thielemann et  al .   and nomoto et  al . , hereafter tnh96 .",
    "we focus on the question , if the considered sets of models are able to explain an important observed feature of galaxy formation : the [ mg / fe ] overabundance .",
    "there is a broad consensus that metal - poor halo stars in our galaxy have magnesium enhanced abundance ratios ( gratton & sneden 1988 ; magain 1989 ; edvardsson et  al .",
    "1993 ; axer , fuhrmann , & gehren 1994 ; axer , fuhrmann , & gehren 1995 ; fuhrmann , axer , & gehren 1995 ) .",
    "the exact value of the enhancement is still debatable , but it seems to converge to @xmath3 dex @xcite .",
    "this observation can be easily understood taking into account that metal - poor stars form in the early stages of the galaxy formation , when the enrichment due to sn  ii is dominating chemical evolution .",
    "however , we will show that there are still unresolved problems caused by uncertainties in stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "as already noted , in elliptical galaxies there are strong indications from spectra in the visual light that there is a magnesium overabundance of at least 0.2 dex in nuclei of these galaxies ( worthey et  al .",
    "1992 ; weiss , peletier , & matteucci 1995 ) . however , while the halo in the solar neighbourhood has low metallicities ( @xmath4[fe / h]@xmath5 ) , the stars which dominate the visual light in the nuclei of ellipticals have solar or super - solar @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the [ mg / fe ] overabundance is realized at both low and high @xmath6 in two considerably different systems . while a detailed inspection of element abundances in elliptical galaxies will be the subject of a forthcoming paper , in this work we concentrate on the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood using ww95 and tnh96 sn  ii yields .    in order to calibrate our code",
    ", we use the same approach as in the most common chemical evolution models ( matteucci & greggio 1986 ; timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ) for the solar neighbourhood , performing the calculation for both sets of nucleosynthesis prescriptions .",
    "taking finite stellar lifetimes into account , the classical numerical models relax the instantaneous _ recycling _ approximation , but usually assume the stellar ejecta to mix instantaneously with the ism @xcite .",
    "only few attempts have been made in the literature to relax the instantaneous _ mixing _ approximation in numerical models of chemical evolution ( see discussion in timmes et  al .",
    "we present a modification of the basic equations @xcite splitting the gaseous mass into two different phases , one including the stellar ejecta and the second being cool and well mixed .",
    "the mixing process is characterized by a gas flow from the first , inactive to the active , star forming gas phase .",

    "parallel to equation  [ eq : gas ] , the mass production of the element @xmath23 in the ism ( @xmath24 ) is expressed in the equation below : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the abundance of element @xmath23 in the ism , @xmath27 is the abundance of element @xmath23 in the in - falling or out - flowing gas",

    "@xmath31    the key value in this equation is the stellar yield @xmath29 hidden in the element ejection rate @xmath32.we neglect stellar winds during the evolution , and assume that the stars enrich the ism at the time when they die .",

    "elements heavier than oxygen are mainly processed in supernovae .",
    "a substantial fraction of iron is contributed by sn  ia . adopting the description of the supernova rates from greggio & renzini , the element ejection rate integrated over the total mass range",
    "can be described with the following equation as in matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) and timmes et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) : @xmath35 in this equation , the enrichment due to stars in the mass range @xmath36 is splitted into a contribution by type ii supernovae ( @xmath37 ) plus planetary nebulae ( @xmath38 ) , due to single stars , and type ia supernovae ( @xmath39 ) , assumed to be the end product of close binary evolution . in the formulation of greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) @xmath40 is the ratio between the mass of the secondary and the total mass @xmath7 of the system .",
    "the maximum fraction of the secondary is 0.5 by definition , while the minimum mass @xmath41 is dependent on the turnoff as defined in the following equation @xcite : @xmath42\\ ] ] one has to integrate the distribution of the secondary component @xmath43 , folded with the yield ( independent of the mass of the system ) and the sfr over the appropriate mass range .",
    "the clock of the sn  ia explosion is given by the lifetime of the secondary @xmath44 , whose mass can be as low as @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "thus , the enrichment due to sn  ia is substantially delayed with respect to sn  ii .",
    "the degree of influence by sn  ia highly depends on the fraction @xmath46 of close binaries , which is a free parameter in chemical evolution .",
    "greggio & renzini calibrate @xmath46 on the ratio between the current type ii to type ia supernova rates in the galaxy .",
    "it should be noticed that equation  [ eq : all_enrich ] is not completely consistent , since @xmath7 refers to the mass of single and binary stars .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the parameter @xmath46 is small ( as in our case ) type ia events can be regarded as a small perturbation .",
    "hence , equation  [ eq : all_enrich ] is an acceptable approximation , and it allows us to describe the delayed release of iron from sn  ia .    in these terms , the rates of type ii and ia supernovae can be described by the following equations : @xmath47 @xmath48      in spite of the several unknown parameters ( imf slope @xmath49 , sfr as a function of time , stellar yields ) , the following arguments show how they can be constrained by different observational information , step by step .",
    "this is useful for the interpretation of the results from chemical evolution calculations .    assuming the instantaneous _ recycling _ approximation",
    ", one can take @xmath12 out of the integral in eqn .",
    "[ eq : ejection ] . for large @xmath22 ,",
    "the residual integral expressing the returned fraction @xmath50 depends strongly on the imf slope @xmath49 but only marginally on turnoff mass ( and then time ) .",
    "equation  [ eq : stars ] can then be written as : @xmath51 the integrated solution demonstrates that the final total mass of stars depends on the _ time - average _ star formation rate @xmath52 and the imf slope . @xmath53 where the subscript zero refers to the initial conditions .",
    "similar considerations show that the final mass of gas in the ism depends on a mean sfr @xmath52 , a mean infall rate @xmath54 and the imf slope .",
    "now we need an approximation to pin down @xmath49 . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the element abundances at the time @xmath22 . the above approximation applied to equation",
    "[ eq : gasmetal ] leads to @xmath56 with @xmath57 as the returned mass fraction of element @xmath23 mostly dependent on the imf slope and the stellar yield .",
    "if we consider an element whose stellar yield is well known , we get a constraint on @xmath49 ( with known abundance of the in - falling gas ) , for a given minimum mass of the stellar population @xmath58 .    to summarize , the stellar and gaseous mass at the current epoch and the abundance of a specific element whose yield is relatively certain constrain @xmath59 and @xmath49 .",
    "we can then draw conclusions on the nucleosynthesis of other elements , whose stellar yields are relatively uncertain . in other words , from chemical evolution of galaxies",
    "one can get a constraint on the stellar evolution models .",
    "this is a convincing example how tight these two disciplines are coupled .",
    "since the approximation @xmath60 is especially valid for elements produced mainly by type ii supernovae , we will use this strategy in section  [ sec : solar ] to fix the imf slope with the element oxygen and constrain the necessary magnesium yield in sn  ii .",
    "the imf is as usual assumed to be a declining function of mass , according to a power law : @xmath61 .",
    "since the imf is usually normalized _ by mass _ , the actual amount of mass created in one generation of stars is controlled by the sfr @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath62 in these terms , the slope @xmath63 corresponds to the salpeter - value @xcite .",
    "to avoid uncertain extrapolations of the stellar yields to the high mass end , we have adopted @xmath64 which is the maximum mass for which ww95-models are computed .",

    "for the comparison between the two sets of models we keep @xmath18 fixed at @xmath66 .",

    "the lower cutoff of one generation of stars is assumed to be @xmath68 .",
    "the higher the minimum mass , the larger is the fraction of massive stars , thus more metals are produced .",
    "abundance ratios , however , are not affected by the choice of @xmath58 .",
    "alternative formulations of the imf with different slopes at different mass ranges exist in the literature ( e.g.  scalo 1986 ; kroupa , tout , & gilmore 1995 ; gould , bahcall , & flynn 1997 ) .",
    "however , in order to keep the number of free parameters low , we have decided to fix @xmath68 and use one specific slope @xmath49 for the whole mass range .",
    "the value of @xmath49 , instead , is treated as a free parameter .",
    "in our calculations , we use the results in renzini & voli ( 1981 ) for the enrichment due to intermediate mass single stars ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "in particular we select the models with @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "type ia sne are assumed to occur in close binary systems @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the explosion is caused by a carbon - deflagration of the material accreting degenerate white dwarf ( hansen & wheeler 1969 ; nomoto 1980 ; weaver & woosley 1980 ; nomoto 1981 ) .",

    "this can be understood in terms of the higher @xmath83-rate in the tnh96 models .",
    "it is worth noting that the large difference in the yields of high mass stars may also result from the fact that ww95 consider fall back of material , whereas tnh96 do not .",
    "the o - yield of tnh96 increases rapidly with mass , the ww95-yields , instead , seem to saturate .",
    "this discrepancy already indicates that there is a huge uncertainty concerning the stellar yields of high mass stars ( @xmath84 ) .    at the lower mass range ( @xmath85 ) ,",

    "the solid line indicates the salpeter - imf .",
    "one can see that the magnesium abundance in the total ejecta is decreasing with turnoff mass for @xmath188 .",

    "the results from tnh96-models are more strongly dependent on the slope of the imf than ww95 , because the contribution of high mass stars to the iron production is smaller in tnh96 ( see also figure  [ cont_mgfe ] ) . for the same reason , the difference between ww95 and tnh96 increases for a flatter imf .        1 .   in the first 10 myr ,",
    "the produced magnesium overabundance is fairly high , the difference between ww95 and tnh96 is extremely large .",
    "ww95 yields reach [ mg / fe]@xmath193 at a turnoff @xmath194 , after 10 myr . even considering a flat imf with @xmath195 , the minimum overabundance in ellipticals of 0.2 dex @xcite",
    "is reached at @xmath196 myr when the contribution of type  ii sne is not yet complete .",
    "tnh96 provide the same value of [ mg / fe ] after 7.3 gyr when sn  ia explosion are already tearing the ratio down .",
    "obviously , this strongly affects the timescales of star formation of a system showing a [ mg / fe ] overabundance .",
    "one generation of sn  ii exploding stars can not produce the magnesium overabundance in metal - poor stars in the solar neighbourhood , when considering salpeter imf and ww95-sn  ii yields . assuming a value of [ mg / fe]@xmath197  which is already a lower limit  all low - metallicity stars should have been born in the first 9 million years ( see also section  [ sec : solar ] ) .",
    "3 .   with progression of time , the overabundance is decreasing , because more and more low mass stars ( @xmath198 ) with higher iron and lower magnesium yields are contributing to the enrichment . once the turnoff mass is @xmath73 , the final sn  ii - ssp value is reached .",
    "4 .   the magnesium overabundance in the sn  ii output increases according to flattening of the imf .",
    "this is because of giving more weight to magnesium producing high mass stars .",
    "the dependence of [ mg / fe ] on the imf slope is increasing with time .",
    "this is understandable , because for a larger considered mass range the role of the imf slope becomes more important .",
    "the tnh96-models provide a [ mg / fe]-ratio of 0.26 dex , ww95-models lead to [ mg / fe]=0.05 dex , both for salpeter - imf .",
    "ww95 specify an uncertainty of a factor of 2 in the iron yield . since this causes a shift by 0.3 dex , one could argue that simply taking half of the iron yield would solve the overabundance problem .",
    "we want to show that this is not the case .",
    "since the iron yields of stars below @xmath98 are very similar in the two sets of models , and since both sets reproduce the observations of sn1987a and sn1993j very well ( see table  [ tab : ni_obs ] ) , it is reasonable only the halve the iron yields of stars above @xmath98 in ww95 .",
    "re - calculating the ssp - yields with the modified fe - yield of ww95 , it turns out that the total [ fe ] is only shifted by 0.08 dex to lower values .",
    "figure  [ sspt_mgfe2 ] shows the [ mg / fe]-ratio as a function of the turnoff mass in this experiment .",
    "the plot shows , that it remains difficult to reproduce the observed magnesium overabundances with ww95 nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is important to mention that also tnh96 magnesium yields may not suffice to explain observed [ mg / fe ] overabundances in elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are several indications that [ mg / fe ] in nuclei of ellipticals does even exceed 0.4 dex @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ sspt_mgfe ] , this value can not be theoretically produced by one sn  ii - exploding generation of stars .",
    "hence , claiming [ mg / fe]@xmath199 dex , the star forming phase in giant ellipticals must be of the order @xmath200 yr , even for tnh96-yields and a flat imf ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "a detailed exploration of star formation timescales , imf - slopes and stellar yields in elliptical galaxies will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "finally , one should not forget , that the number of input parameters in the calculations is very small .",
    "the above conclusions do not depend on galaxy formation scenarios , on star formation histories , on infall models , or on binary fractions .",
    "the only considered parameters are the imf slope and stellar yields .",
    "figure  [ sspt_oxfe ] shows the time dependent ssp yield as a function of turnoff mass for the abundance ratio [ o / fe ] . since both , oxygen and magnesium ,",
    "are produced mainly in type ii supernovae , one would expect similar values for the overabundance .    for tnh96 ,",
    "this is exactly the case .",
    "the contribution of low mass stars ( @xmath202 ) to the enrichment of oxygen manifests itself in an elongation of the sn  ii plateau down to @xmath203 .",
    "although sn  ia produces 6 times more oxygen than magnesium , the sn  ia tears the curve down by approximatly the same amount because of the dominant role of iron in the ejecta .",
    "the ww95-[o / fe]-ratio , instead , is 0.12 dex higher than [ mg / fe ] .",
    "the discrepancy between ww95 and tnh96 [ o / fe]-ratios now originates mainly from the discrepancy in the iron yields , while oxygen yields differ by 0.02 dex .",
    "this leads again to the conclusion , that ww95 may underestimate the magnesium yield .      in this paragraph",
    ", we will investigate the influence of a variation of the upper mass cutoff on the calculated ssp - yields .",
    "for this purpose , we include the results of tnh96 for the @xmath65-star . in order to compare the different nucleosynthesis prescriptions",
    ", we have to extrapolate the ww95-yields to higher masses , hence the result has to be interpreted with cautions . in the ww95-models most heavy elements re - implode for the massive stars , so that the contribution of these stars to the enrichment is negligible . indeed , the plots in figures  [ oxy_z ] and  [ iron_mag ] show this trend for the elements oxygen and magnesium , respectively ( also model b ) .",

    "we calculated the sn  ii ssp - yields of o , mg , and fe for different imf slopes and both nucleosynthesis prescriptions .",
    "the result is that tnh96-nucleosynthesis leads to @xmath358}=0.26 $ ] dex for salpeter - imf , while the ratio with ww95 ( @xmath86 , model b ) is 0.05 dex .",
    "we showed that this discrepancy is due to a lower mg - ssp - yield of 0.13 dex and a higher fe - ssp - yield of 0.08 dex in ww95 .",
    "even for a flat imf with @xmath201 , the ssp - value of [ mg / fe ] is 0.12 dex with ww95-yields . without any impact from complex evolution models , from these numbers one can already conclude , that the [ mg / fe ] overabundance in both , ellipticals and the solar neighbourhood , can not be explained with the stellar yields of the ww95-models .    applying",
    "the standard infall - model @xcite on the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood confirms the conclusions drawn from the discussion of the ssp yields .",
    "both , the [ mg / fe ] overabundance in metal - poor stars and the magnesium abundance of the sun can be better reproduced with the mg - yields of tnh96 . in addition to this , we discussed the relaxation of the instantaneous _ mixing _ approximation for the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "for this purpose , we modified the basic equations of chemical evolution seperating the gaseous component into two different gas phases . while the _",
    "inactive _ phase is enriched by the stellar ejecta , stars can only form out of the _ active _ , well mixed phase . a mass flow from the _ inactive _ to the _ active _ gas phase on a variable timescale represents the mixing process . for different mixing timescales of the order @xmath359 yr , we investigated the influence of a delayed mixing on the reproduction of the observational features .",
    "it turns out that a delay in the mixing supports the approximately constant value of [ mg / fe ] in the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h]-diagram in the low - metallicity range , while the agreement with the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) and solar element abundances is not violated .",
    "however , since a delayed mixing causes the formation of more low - metallicity stars , the abundance distribution function ( adf ) is less well reproduced . on the other hand ,",
    "the instantaneous mixing of the stellar ejecta is certainly an unrealistic assumption , and the inclusion of a delay is a necessary step to improve chemical evolution models .",
    "hence , the solution of the g - dwarf problem in the solar neighbourhood may require a combination of infall and pre - enrichment .",
    "since tnh96 include the @xmath65-star in their computations , we additionally investigated the influence of a variation of the upper mass cutoff on the theoretical ssp - yields and on the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "applying tnh96 nucleosynthesis , the [ mg / fe ] ratio in the ejecta of one ssp is significantly increased .",
    "this result is highly uncertain , however , because tnh96 do not consider fall back , which may play an important role for the nucleosynthetic contribution from high mass stars . indeed , extrapolating the results of ww95 to @xmath65 leaves the ssp yields basically unchanged .",
    "the problem of the underestimation of the solar magnesium abundance remains the same also for tnh96-yields , since the mg / o ratio in stars more massive than @xmath66 is even smaller .",
    "however , it is important to investigate quantitatively the metal contribution of stars more massive than @xmath66 , since they could play an important role for chemical evolution .    in general",
    ", we demonstrated the sensitivity of galactic chemical evolution on nucleosynthesis prescriptions of type ii supernovae .",
    "different stellar yields can significantly alter conclusions on the parameters of chemical evolution models like imf slope or star formation timescales .",
    "as long as the stellar nucleosynthesis of important elements like magnesium and iron is affected by so many uncertainties , the results from simulations of chemical evolution have to be interpreted considering the whole range of up to date nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "we would like to thank b.  pagel , the referee of the paper , for carefully reading the first version and giving important remarks on the subject .",
    "he especially motivated us to explore the influence of the upper mass cutoff on the results of the calculations .",
