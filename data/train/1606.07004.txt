    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are one of the last phases in the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "their immediate precursors are stars in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , characterized by a strong mass - loss ( with rates up to @xmath2 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , followed by a short ( @xmath4 yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) transitional post - agb phase .",
    "while the morphology of the mass - loss processes in the agb is mainly spherical , pne usually show complex bipolar and multipolar structures .",
    "it is thought that the shaping of these asymmetrical pne is determined by highly collimated jets ejected during the post - agb and early pn phases , which open cavities in the previously ejected agb envelope @xcite .",
    "however , the ultimate powering agent of these jets and their timescale of action are still largely unknown .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that jets in post - agbs and young pne are launched and collimated by magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , likely requiring the presence of binary central stars @xcite .",
    "oh masers are potentially important tools in the study of the transition to pne , due to their timescales of pumping in evolved objects .",
    "oh masers are expected to disappear @xmath5 years after the end of the agb mass - loss @xcite . considering that the post - agb phase lasts @xmath6 yr ( depending on the stellar mass ) , pne showing oh emission",
    "are expected to be very young .",
    "very few members of this special type of oh - emitting pne ( ohpne ) are known : @xcite initially cataloged 12 possible ohpne , mainly based on single - dish oh data , while interferometric data @xcite confirmed only 6 sources as bona fide members of this class .",
    "a seventh ohpn has been recently confirmed ( iras 16333 - 4807 , * ? ? ?",
    "these objects could be among the youngest pne , and therefore , key objects in the study of pn shaping .",
    "moreover , the presence of oh masers is important from a practical point of view , since their polarimetric observation can provide information on the magnetic field strength , by measuring zeeman splitting .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields would cause the two sigma - components of the oh lines , seen to be circularly polarised when the field is not purely in the plane of the sky , to be shifted alternately in frequency ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review in the context of maser emission ) , in what is known as a `` zeeman pair '' .",
    "this splitting typically results in a characteristic s - shaped profile in spectra of the stokes v parameter ( with a negative and a positive peak close together in frequency ) . through examining this profile and its characteristics for multiple sources ,",
    "it is then possible to study whether magnetic fields play a significant role in the shaping of pne .",
    "magnetic field strengths have been estimated for several agb and post - agb stars using polarimetric maser observations of oh , h@xmath7o , and sio @xcite , showing ordered magnetic fields of a few g close to the central star , and decreasing up to @xmath8 mg at 1000 au .",
    "however , such observations are scarce in pne , given the low detection rates of maser emission in this type of objects .",
    "ohpne do not seem to form an homogeneous group @xcite . while objects such as iras 17347@xmath93139 or k3 - 35 are optically obscured and/or compact in size ( @xmath10 au ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , others like ngc 6302 are optically bright and very extended ( @xmath8 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus , they are probably more evolved pne .",
    "therefore not all ohpne seem to strictly conform to their expected nature as extremely young pne , and some other process may sustain oh emission for a longer time than previously assumed .",
    "this apparent age spread within the ohpn group is interesting , since it would allow us to study the evolution of their properties , and to derive information about the shaping of pne .",
    "in particular , if magnetic fields are indeed a key factor in the powering and collimation of jets leading to asymmetrical pne , we would expect these fields to be significantly stronger in obscured and/or compact ( thus probably younger ) sources than in the more evolved ones .",
    "previous polarimetric studies of oh - emitting evolved objects with single dish telescopes @xcite included ohpne among their targets .",
    "these studies showed that , while circularly polarised oh features are common in ohpne , the detection of zeeman pairs is far more elusive .",
    "interferometric observations have shown more promising candidates .",
    "the only ohpn in which zeeman splitting has been distinctively detected is iras 16333 - 4807 at 1720 mhz @xcite , with a derived magnetic field strength of @xmath11 mg .",
    "another possible zeeman pair has been reported in k 3 - 35 , at 1665 mhz @xcite , giving an estimate of @xmath12 mg .",
    "both objects are probably among the youngest pne , as they are both oh and h@xmath7o maser emitters @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present interferometric , full - polarisation observations of most of the known ohpne , in order to study the characteristics of their magnetic fields .",
    "observations were carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , in its 6a configuration @xcite .",
    "we used the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) in its 1m-0.5k mode , with 2 intermediate frequency bands ( ifs ) , each with a 2 ghz bandwidth sampled over 2048 broadband channels of 1 mhz .",
    "we obtained data in full polarisation ( two linear polarisations and their corresponding cross - polarisations , so as to form the full stokes parameters , i , q , u and v ) .",
    "both ifs were centered at 2100 mhz , providing redundant data .",
    "we used the first if in our data processing , except when noted otherwise .",
    "twelve 1mhz broadband channels ( four groups of 3 channels ) were zoomed in , to provide a finer spectral resolution of 0.5 khz to observe spectral lines . with this setup",
    ", we observed the oh ground - level transitions of rest frequencies 1612.2309 , 1665.4018 , 1667.3590 , and 1720.5299 mhz , with a total bandwidth of 2 mhz each , sampled over 4096 channels of 0.5 khz ( total velocity coverage and resolution of 381 and 0.09 km s@xmath3 at 1612 mhz , respectively ) .",
    "we observed a total of 5 fields .",
    "the source pks b1934 - 638 was used to set the absolute flux scale and to calibrate the spectral response of the instrument .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] gives a summary of some additional observational parameters .",
    "the velocities in our data are given to respect to the kinematic definition of the local standard of rest ( lsrk ) ."
