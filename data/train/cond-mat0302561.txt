    "geometrical frustration in both localized and itinerant electron systems is an important ingredient giving rise to a rich variety of condensed phases . @xcite in localized spin systems , magnetic frustration suppresses a tendency toward a conventional long - range order , and may stabilize some exotic state such as a spin liquid or a valence bond crystal , as has been extensively explored both experimentally@xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite also , for itinerant systems , it has been argued that geometrical frustration may cause some novel phenomena such as heavy fermion state,@xcite anomalous hall effect induced by the chiral order,@xcite and so forth . among them , metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) in geometrically frustrated systems is an intriguing unsettled issue .",
    "it has been found experimentally that the pyrochlore oxides , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the spinel compounds , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , exhibit mit without magnetic long - range order at finite critical temperatures.@xcite since such systems possess the fully - frustrated lattice structure , referred to as a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra ( that is , a pyrochlore lattice ) , the magnetic properties of the insulating phase are not yet understood .",
    "moreover the mechanism of the mits observed in these systems is still an open problem .",
    "in contrast to the localized spin systems , the presence of charge degrees of freedom provides a route for the relaxation of magnetic frustration .",
    "however , when electron correlation is sufficiently strong , the magnetic frustration may still affect the low - energy properties significantly .",
    "thus , it is expected that geometrical frustration plays an important role in the mits . from this point of view , in the present paper , we study the interplay between electron correlation and geometrical frustration in the hubbard model on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) pyrochlore lattice and on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) checkerboard lattice , the so - called 2d pyrochlore ( fig.1 ) . although real pyrochlore oxides and spinel compounds have electronic structure composed of @xmath4 orbitals , the present study on these simpler single - band models may provide important insight into the role of geometrical frustration in mit .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 has , apart from the @xmath4 band , a nearly half - filled tl @xmath5 band , whose important features are described by the 3d pyrochlore hubbard model.@xcite we believe that this model may provide a useful understanding of the mit undergone in this material .",

    "the non - interacting energy bands of these two hubbard models have a common interesting feature : they consist of a flat band ( or two degenerate flat bands ) on the upper band edge and a dispersive band that is tangent to the flat band ( or flat bands ) at the @xmath6 point.@xcite itinerant ferromagnetism in the case that the flat bands are partially occupied has been extensively studied by several authors so far.@xcite this particular band structure is due to the geometrical property of _ line graph _ in which the above 2d and 3d pyrochlore lattices are classified . according to a theorem of the graph theory,@xcite a tight - binding model on a line graph generated from a bipartite graph with @xmath7 vertices and @xmath8 edges has flat bands with the degeneracy @xmath9 lying on the band edge of dispersive bands . here",
    "@xmath10 is the total number of unit cells on the lattice .",
    "it should be noted that the existence of the flat bands is analogous to the macroscopically large degeneracy of the ground state of classical spin systems on line graphs.@xcite since line graphs consist of a network of complete graphs which have a frustrated structure , the presence of the flat bands is a result of geometrical frustration inherent in the lattice structure .",
    "we would like to stress that , to study effects of geometrical frustration in correlated electron systems , we should distinguish two classes of geometrically frustrated systems : one is the class of line graph , and the other is not , and does not possess flat bands .",
    "for example , a triangular lattice is classified in the latter class . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the former class , and show that , in the half - filling case , the geometrical frustration in the above models drives the system into an insulating state with a spin gap as well as a charge gap . also , in the insulating state , the spin rotational symmetry is not broken , while charge ordering exists .",

    "the momentum dependence of @xmath172 is quite small , indicating that geometrical frustration suppresses any tendency toward a conventional magnetic order .",
    "such small @xmath173-dependence of @xmath172 was also found in the semi - metal state above @xmath174.@xcite      here , we examine the possibility of a co state in the 3d system .",
    "there are four sites in a unit cell .",
    "the appearance of a gap causes a charge density displacement on each site given by , @xmath175 for @xmath176 , and , @xmath177 using the symmetry properties of @xmath99 , we obtain , @xmath178 it is thus found that co with the pattern displayed in fig.8 occurs in the insulating phase .",
    "interestingly , a similar co pattern is observed in the spinel system @xmath179 which possesses a v - site corner - sharing tetrahedron network.@xcite within the above analysis , the sign of @xmath180 , which depends on the phase of the order parameter @xmath181 , is not determined .",
    "thus , the states of @xmath182 and @xmath183 are degenerated . as will be discussed in the next section ,",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by the coupling with lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the co pattern shown in fig.8 is regarded as an alternate stack of 2d kagome lattices and triangular lattices in the @xmath184 $ ] direction . as in the 2d case",
    ", co brings about the effective reduction of spatial dimension to relax geometrical frustration .",
    "= 2.6 cm    fig.8 . the co pattern in the 3d case .",
    "as in the 2d case , co found in the previous section may bring about lattice distortion . here , we discuss this possibility . since , at the half - filling , all important processes occur in the vicinity of the @xmath6 point , it is sufficient to consider the point group of the tetrahedron @xmath155 .",
    "the representation of @xmath155 is reduced to @xmath185 .",
    "the triply degenerated levels at the @xmath6 point @xmath186 ( @xmath123 ) belong to @xmath187 .",
    "thus , the normal modes that may lift the degeneracy are obtained from the symmetric product representation , @xmath188={\\rm a_1}+{\\rm e}+{\\rm t_2}$ ]",
    ". the normal coordinates corresponding to these three modes are , @xmath189 they are schematically shown in fig.9(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . the breezing mode @xmath190 does not lift the degeneracy at the @xmath6 point .",
    "the @xmath191 and @xmath187 modes split the triply degenerated levels into three different levels or one separated level and doubly degenerated levels .",
    "the modification of the kinetic energy due to these modes are , @xmath192 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & b_{\\rm t_2}\\sum_{i , j}\\bigl[\\frac{q^{(1)}({\\rm t_2})}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( c^{\\dagger}_{i1}c_{j4}-c^{\\dagger}_{i2}c_{j3}+h.c . ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{q^{(2)}({\\rm t_2})}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( c^{\\dagger}_{i1}c_{j2}-c^{\\dagger}_{i3}c_{j4}+h.c . ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{q^{(3)}({\\rm t_2})}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( c^{\\dagger}_{i1}c_{j3}-c^{\\dagger}_{i2}c_{j4}+h.c.)\\bigr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the stretch of bonds may reduce the hopping integral , it is plausible to assume @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the lattice distortion that is consistent with the co pattern shown in fig.8 is obtained by putting @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
    "this mode is shown in fig.10 .",
    "here we have dropped the rotational degrees of freedom around @xmath197-axis . for @xmath198 ,",
    "the triply degenerated levels at the @xmath6 point split into one lower level and upper doubly degenerated levels .",
    "thus , at the half - filling , this lattice distortion generates a full gap without a node in the single - particle excitation . note that the full gap opens not only at the @xmath6 point but also over the entire brillouin zone , as easily verified by diagonalizing the kinetic term with this lattice distortion . on the other hand , for @xmath199",
    ", the lower levels are doubly degenerated , and the system is still in the semi - metallic state unless we do not take into account the correlation - driven co transition obtained in the previous sections .",
    "thus it is expected that the case of @xmath198 , in which both the lattice distortion and electron correlation stabilize the gapped state , is energetically favorable . under the trigonal distortion with @xmath198 shown in fig.10 ,",
    "the charge density on the site 4 in the tetrahedron is larger than those on the other three sites .",
    "this is easily seen by calculating straightforwardly the charge density on each site in a single tetrahedron with the trigonal distortion .",
    "then , the sigh of @xmath180 , which is not determined in the absence of the lattice - coupling as mentioned in the previous sections , is chosen as @xmath182 by the lattice distortion .",
    "the lattice distortion discussed here and the co state shown in fig.8 are similar to the experimental observation for @xmath179 , apart from the doubling of the unit cell in the @xmath200 $ ] direction found in @xmath179.@xcite since , in @xmath179 , the @xmath4 orbital of v sites plays a central role , our simple model is not directly applicable to this system .",
    "however , according to the recent lda calculation , the band structure near the fermi surface possesses @xmath5-like character because the @xmath5 orbital of al site partially hybridizes with the @xmath201 orbital split from the @xmath4 orbital by a trigonal crystal field.@xcite thus , co observed in @xmath179 may be microscopically explained by the mechanism described here .",
    "it should be emphasized that in our scenario , the interplay between electron correlation and geometrical frustration is the most important ingredient for the realization of the co state and the lattice distortion is merely a secondary effect .",

    "we now apply the results obtained above to the description of the mit observed in @xmath0 . as mentioned in the introduction , according to ishii and oguchi , the electronic structure of this system consists of the @xmath5-orbital of tl sites , as well as the @xmath4-orbitals of ru sites.@xcite the band structure formed by the former is well approximated by our model .",

    "the experimental determination of whether a co state exists for @xmath0 is a crucial test of this theory .",

    "the co pattern found in this paper is also very similar to that observed in @xmath179 .",
    "the mechanism for co in this system may be explained by the scenario described in this paper , because the electronic structure of @xmath179 possesses partially flat bands,@xcite which is a crucial ingredient for co induced by geometrical frustration .",
