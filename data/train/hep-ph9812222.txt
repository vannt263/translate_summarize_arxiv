    "the indication for the existence of neutrino oscillation has originally appeared in the atmospheric neutrino data of kamiokande  @xcite & imb  @xcite where the measurement of the ratio @xmath1 of @xmath2like and @xmath3like events was lower than the monte carlo expectation .",
    "the recent data of super  kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite have strengthened the evidence for the existence of an anomaly in the flavour ratio of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ". moreover the high statistics of sk show distortions of the angular distributions of the sub  gev and the multi ",
    "gev @xmath2like events that suggest the @xmath4 oscillation hypothesis , while the angular distribution of the @xmath3like events is consistent with the no  oscillation hypothesis .",
    "this evidence is also supported by the soudan2  @xcite data and by the sk & macro  @xcite data on up - going muons .",
    "the absence of an oscillation signal in the data of the chooz  @xcite experiment essentially rules out the @xmath5 oscillations in the interesting region of parameter space and favours the interpretation of the sk result in terms of @xmath6 oscillation with @xmath7 in the range @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the range @xmath10 .",
    "more exotic interpretations , like @xmath11 , are at present not fully excluded .",
    "a possible method to confirm these results is the development of long  baseline accelerator neutrino beams .",
    "the accelerator beams can have higher intensity and higher average energy than the atmospheric flux , and if @xmath6 oscillations are indeed the cause of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , they can produce a measurable rate of @xmath12 leptons for most of the values of the oscillation parameters that are a solution to the atmospheric data .    on the other hand measurements of atmospheric neutrinos with large statistics and/or better experimental resolutions , can also provide convincing evidence for oscillations , thanks to unambiguous detectable effects on the energy , zenith angle and @xmath13 distributions of the events .",
    "the study of these effects can provide a precise determination of the oscillations parameters .",
    "the range of @xmath13 available for atmospheric neutrinos ( @xmath14 ) is much larger than that of long  baseline accelerator experiments ( @xmath15 ) and the sensitivity extends to lower values of @xmath7 .",
    "all these considerations call for a comprehensive physics programme , whose main goals are :     the search for a direct neutrino oscillation signal in the full range indicated by the sk results ;     the precise test of the @xmath6 oscillation hypothesis ;     the measurement of the relevant oscillation parameters : at least one squared mass difference , @xmath7 , and one mixing angle , @xmath9 .    the above arguments stimulated a joint cern  infn project for a beam towards the gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) , 732 km away .",
    "at the same time several lbl and sbl experiments , based on very different techniques , as well as atmospheric neutrino experiments have been proposed and recently reviewed by a joint cern ",
    "lngs scientific committee .    in the following sections we will review the status of the future cern ",
    "lngs neutrino programme ( section 2 . ) and of the new cern neutrino beam to gran sasso ( section 3 . ) . in section 4 .",
    "we will describe the proposed lbl experiments and discuss their sensitivity and significance in the sk allowed region of the oscillation parameter space .",
    "finally in section 5 .",
    "we will outline the characteristics and the sensitivity of a possible massive detector for atmospheric neutrino physics .",
    "here we faithfully report the out - come of the first meeting of the recently constituted joint cern ",
    "lngs scientific committee .",
    "the meeting was held at cern on november 3 - 4 , 1998 with the aim of reviewing the overall cern ",
    "lngs neutrino experimental programme and evaluating its potentiality also in view of the exsistence of other similar projects  @xcite .",
    "the committee believes that a combined experimental effort can accomplish the above programme .",
    "elements of this programme are :    \\i ) a large mass ( larger then @xmath16 ) atmospheric neutrino experiment with high resolution in angle and neutrino energy , so that an explicit oscillation pattern can be put in evidence",
    ". such a detector can be sensitive to oscillations for @xmath17 , covering all the relevant region also in view of the k2k experiment  @xcite , and can measure both the mass difference and at least one of the mixing angles .",
    "\\ii ) a long base line ( lbl ) beam from cern to gran sasso as laid out in documents cern 9802 and cern ",
    "spsc 9835 .",
    "the feasibility of constructing a neutrino beam towards gran sasso has been demonstrated , being well - suited for experiments and with a built - in flexibility allowing the beam design to evolve with the field of neutrino oscillation physics .",
    "\\iii ) a @xmath0 appearance lbl experiment , uniquely capable of precisely discriminating the @xmath6 oscillation hypothesis in the range above @xmath18 with underground detectors .",
    "ways of extending this mass range may exist , possibly in successive steps , due to extremely low experimental background and the possibility of using a detector on the surface .",
    "the search for @xmath19 appearance can nicely be coupled with @xmath0 appearance experiments . however , due to the small number of signal events expected , a @xmath0 appearance experiment may not be effective in actually determining the oscillation parameters .",
    "\\iv ) a @xmath4 disappearance lbl experiment , with the need for a near station , again sensitive down to @xmath20 in @xmath7 , provided the systematic effects can be kept under control to a sufficient level of accuracy .",
    "the complementarity between iii ) and i ) or iv ) is manifest .",
    "the same is not true for i ) and iv ) , with i ) having a larger reach potential at low @xmath7 .",
    "the possible integration of two or more elements stated above into one combined detector deserves attention , to the extent that this can be shown to be compatible with the individual goals outlined .",
    "the committee also took note of the scientific interest expressed by :     a short baseline experiment to search for @xmath6 oscillation beyond the sensitivity reach of chorus and nomad ( spsc 98 - 29 & m616 ) .     a low energy neutrino beam derived from the ps to search for @xmath21 oscillation in the range of parameters suggested by lsnd ( spsc 98 - 27 & m614 ) .",
    " a long - term experimental neutrino programme at cern based on a future neutrino factory , offering high flux neutrino beams originating from a high intensity injector proton booster and/or muon storage ring of a @xmath22 collider ( spsc 98 - 30 & m617 , spsc 98 - 31 & m618 ) .",
    "a substantial part of the cern  lngs neutrino program will be based on a new cern neutrino beam line ( ngs ) pointing to gran sasso , 732 km away .",
    "the conceptual design of this facility has been studied in detail by a technical committee , mandated by cern and infn , and it feasibility has been fully demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the ngs neutrino beam is produced from the decay of mesons , mostly @xmath23 s and @xmath24 s .",
    "the mesons are created by the interaction of a 400 gev proton beam onto a graphite target , they are sign - selected and focused in the forward direction by two magnetic coaxial lenses , called horn and reflector and finally they are let to decay in an evacuated tunnel pointing toward gran sasso .",
    "as clearly stated in the ngs report  @xcite , the design concentrated on the civil engineering , freezing some parameters but keeping flexibility in the actual choice of the beam optics .",
    "mainly the proton energy , the extraction from the sps , the target room design , the geometry of the decay tunnel and the beam absorber were choosen .",
    "the main characteristics of the neutrino beam - line are listed in table  [ tab : ngstab ] .    .main",
    "parameter list of the ngs neutrino beam [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tab : disco ] the minimum @xmath7 at full mixing satisfying the inequality @xmath25 , as well as the exclusion value at @xmath26 , are shown for the proposed appearance experiments ( icarus , super ",
    "icarus , opera , aqua - rich and noe ) . for most of the experiments",
    "the discovery potential extends below the sk best fit point ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) in the sk allowed region of the oscillation parameter space .",
    "a new generation of massive atmospheric neutrino detectors would be particularly useful to measure precisely and separately the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 as explained in  @xcite .",
    "atmospheric neutrino fluxes are not in general up / down symmetric .",
    "however , the up / down asymmetry , which is mainly due to geomagnetic effects , is reduced to the percent level for neutrino energies above 1.3 gev . at these energies , for @xmath29 ,",
    "downward muon neutrinos are not affected by oscillations .",
    "thus , they may constitute a _ near _ reference source .",
    "upward neutrinos are instead affected by oscillations , since the @xmath13 ratio of their path length over the energy ranges up to @xmath30 .",
    "therefore with atmospheric neutrinos one may study oscillations with a single detector and two sources : a _ near _ and a _ far _ one .",
    "the effects of oscillations are then searched comparing the @xmath13 distribution for the upward neutrinos , which should be modulated by oscillations , with a reference distribution obtained from the downward neutrinos . for upward neutrinos",
    "the path length @xmath31 is determined by their zenith angle as @xmath32 , while the reference distribution is obtained replacing the actual path length of downward neutrinos with the mirror - distance @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 will then correspond to the survival probability given by @xmath35    a smearing of the modulation is introduced by the finite @xmath13 resolution of the detector .",
    "we point out that results obtained by this method are not sensitive to calculations of atmospheric fluxes .",
    "we also remark that this method does not work with neutrinos at angles near to the horizontal , since the path lengths corresponding to a direction and its mirror - direction are of the same order .",
    "if evidence of neutrino oscillation from the study of @xmath4 disappearance is obtained , a method based on @xmath12 appearance can be used to discriminate between oscillations @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "oscillations of @xmath4 into @xmath0 would in fact result in an excess of muon - less events produced by upward neutrinos with respect to muon - less downward . due to threshold effects on @xmath12 production",
    "this excess would be important at high energy .",
    "oscillations into a sterile neutrino would instead result in a depletion of upward muon - less events .",
    "discrimination between @xmath6 and @xmath11 is thus obtained from a study of the asymmetry of upward to downward muon - less events . because this method works with the high energy component of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", it becomes effective for @xmath36 .",
    "the outlined experimental method requires that the energy @xmath37 and direction @xmath38 of the incoming neutrino be measured in each event .",
    "the latter , in the simplest experimental approach , can be estimated from the direction of the muon produced in the @xmath4 charged - current interaction .",
    "the estimate of the neutrino energy @xmath37 requires the measurement of the energy of the muon and of the hadrons produced in the interaction . in order to make the oscillation pattern detectable",
    ", the experimental requirement is that @xmath13 be measured with an error smaller than half of the modulation period .",
    "this translates into requirements on the energy and angular resolutions of the detector . as a general feature the resolution on @xmath13 improves at high energies , mostly because the muon direction gives an improved estimate of the neutrino direction .",
    "thus the ability to measure high momentum muons ( in the multi - gev range ) , which is rather limited in the on - going atmospheric neutrino experiments , would be particularly rewarding .",
    "a detector with a high efficiency on @xmath39 separation is required for an effective implementation of the method proposed , while , leaving aside oscillations involving electron neutrinos , no stringent requirement is put on electron identification and electromagnetic energy resolution .      a large",
    "mass and high - density tracking calorimeter with horizontal sampling planes has been proposed as a suitable detector  @xcite .",
    "a mass of a few tens of kilotons is necessary to have enough neutrino interaction rate at high energies , while the high - density enables to operate the detector as a muon range - meter .",
    "the detector consists in a stack of 120 horizontal iron planes 8 cm thick and @xmath40 surface , interleaved by planes of sensitive elements ( rpc s and/or limited streamer tubes ) .",
    "the sensitive elements , housed in a 2 cm gap between the iron planes , provide two coordinates with a pitch of 3 cm .",
    "the height of the detector it thus 12 metres .",
    "the total mass exceeds @xmath41 .",
    "the number of read - out channels is 180,000 .",
    "the proponents of  @xcite claim that with appropriate selections on @xmath2like events the experiment can reach the @xmath13 resolution required to resolve the modulation periods typical of the oscillation phenomena for @xmath7 values in the range @xmath42 . as an examples , the @xmath13 distribution obtained with the method described in section 5.1 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 is plotted in figure [ fig : atm ] .",
    "the discovery potential of the experiment , after three years of exposure , is also shown .    as indicated by the icarus  @xcite , aqua  rich  @xcite and nice  @xcite collaborations ,",
    "similar results can be obtained with different detection techniques provided that the detector mass exceeds several tens of @xmath45 .",
    "we believe that the neutrino oscillation search , based on the ngs facility complemented by atmospheric neutrino detection , constitutes an extremely appealing and realistic physics programme for cern and for lngs , which will keep european neutrino physics at the frontier .    our personal opinion , strengthened by the indications of the joint cern  lngs scientific committee , is that the ngs beam is extremely well suited to perform @xmath6 and @xmath21 appearance search while while @xmath4 disappearance is better identified exploiting atmospheric neutrinos ; to measure the oscillation parameters unambigously , a detector with very good @xmath13 resolution is needed .",
    "even if the sk neutrino anomaly would turn out not to be due to neutrino oscillations , an unlikely but a priori not excluded possibility , this experimental programme would under all circumstances explore a significant region of the oscillation parameter space which is not accessible otherwise .",
    "_ the joint cern ",
    "lngs scientific commettee has underlined the importance that the relevant decisions to establish this program , or part of it , be taken as soon as possible by the appropriate bodies in order not to undermine its effectiveness . for the same reason , it has been highly recommendable that suitable experimental proposals be presented in october 1999 along the lines given above and with appropriate strengths of the collaborations . _",
    "if promptly funded the cern ",
    "lngs neutrino program could start taking data by the year 2003 .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the organisers of the _ xviii international conference on neutrino physics and astrophysics _ for giving us the opportunity to review the status and the perspective of the experimental neutrino oscillation programme in europe ."
