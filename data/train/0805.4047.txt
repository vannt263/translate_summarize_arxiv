    "applications of phase - transforming materials such as shape memory alloys ( smas ) and shape memory polymers are very broad .",
    "for example , they have been used to make satellite dampers , golf club heads and snake - like robots and so on . in particular ,",
    "these materials have been used to design many minimal surgery devices ( pelton _ et al .",
    "a deep and thorough understanding of the behaviour of this type of phase - transforming material is essential in the manufacturing and designing of these devices .",
    "systematic experiments on uniaxial extensions of superelastic niti alloy ( a kind of shape memory alloys and also one kind of phase - transforming materials ) wires and strips ( shaw @xmath0 kyriakides 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ) showed the measured engineering stress - strain curves have the key features : the nucleation stress occurs at a local maximum which is significantly larger than the maxwell stress ; following the nucleation stress there is a sharp stress drop ; and afterwards there is a stress plateau .",
    "these features were also observed in experiments done by others ( sun _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , tse @xmath0 sun 2000 , favier _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 and li @xmath0 sun 2002 ) .",
    "theoretically , solid - solid phase transitions have also been studied for a long time in the context of both continuum and lattice theories .",
    "the seminal work of ericksen ( 1975 ) , which considered a continuum one - dimensional stress problem , made clear that for a non - convex strain energy function the solution with two phases can arise and there are multiple solutions .",
    "based on the lattice model for a two - phase martensitic material , it is possible to deduce in the related continuum model the strain - energy function has double wells ; see ball @xmath0 james ( 1992 ) . in general",
    ", it is now understood that in the continuum scale for a material whose strain - energy function is non - convex phase transitions can take place ( see also , abeyaratne _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . with a proper choice of a strain - energy function ,",
    "phase transitions can be modeled through a continuum theory . still , to justify this point of view , it is desirable ( probably necessary ) to compare the analytical solutions based on this type of energy functions with experimental results .",
    "but , the difficulty is that we lack mathematical theories for mixed type equations that typically arise from non - convex energy functions .",
    "analytical solutions for boundary - value problems are very few . in the classical paper of ericksen ( 1975 ) , analytical solutions were constructed for a static problem based on a pure one - dimensional stress model , which neglects the effect from other dimensions .",
    "however , a one - dimensional model appears to be not sophisticated enough to capture some key features observed in experiments .",
    "we give the explanations below .",
    "in the experiments ( shaw @xmath0 kyriakides 1995 , 1997 ; li @xmath0 sun 2002 ) , it was observed that after the nucleation stress was reached the nucleation process began and accompanying with it there was a radial contraction ( necking ) . also , after the two - phase state was formed , the deformation was inhomogeneous , one part being thin and one part being thick . as pointed out by chang",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) that the axial extent of the transformation front is of the order of the radius .",
    "thus , to model the nucleation process and the inhomogeneous deformation of different thicknesses , one should consider the radial deformation .",
    "theoretically , if one treats the problem as a one - dimensional stress one , there is a discontinuous interface between two phases with two different strain values .",
    "the thicknesses of the cylinder at two phases are different , thus the shear strain @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the radial displacement and @xmath3 is the axial coordinate ) is nonzero ( infinite at the phase boundary ) .",
    "the traction - free boundary conditions require the two stress components @xmath4 ( depending on @xmath5 up to the second order ) and @xmath6 ( depending on @xmath1 ) to be zero at the lateral surface , which can not be satisfied .",
    "thus , it appears that to model phase transitions by a one - dimensional stress approximation violates the traction - free boundary conditions .    in the papers of dai @xmath0 cai ( 2006 ) and cai @xmath0 dai ( 2006 ) , phase transitions in a slender cylinder composed of a _ special _ _ incompressible _",
    "elastic material was considered .",
    "a novel series - asymptotic approach is utilized to reduce the field equations .",
    "a proper asymptotic model equation is derived , which takes into account the influences of the radial deformation and traction - free boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions for two boundary - value problems are obtained , and they could capture the key features observed in experiments .    in this paper , we study the phase transitions in a slender cylinder composed of a _ general _ _ compressible _ elastic material due to tension / extension . also , different from the previous studies on _ incompressible _ materials , here we further consider the coupling effect of the material nonlinearity and geometrical size .",
    "another important new feature is that we consider the more practical clamped end conditions instead of the natural boundary conditions used in cai @xmath0 dai ( 2006 ) .",
    "we consider the problem in a three - dimensional setting , different from the one - dimensional stress problem studied by ericksen ( 1975 ) .",
    "however , the strain - energy function is assumed to have the same property as that in ericksen ( 1975 ) , i.e. , for a one - dimensional stress problem the stress - strain curve has a peak - valley combination ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "we aim at constructing the asymptotic solutions and using them to explain the experimental results .",
    "mathematically , to deduce the analytical solutions for the present problem is a very difficult task .",
    "one need to deal with coupled nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde s ) together with complicated boundary conditions .",
    "further , the existence of multiple solutions ( corresponding to the instability phenomena ( e.g. , stress drop ) observed in experiments ) makes the problem even harder to solve . here , the analysis is carried out by a novel methodology developed earlier ( dai @xmath0 huo 2002 ; dai @xmath0 fan 2004 ; dai @xmath0 cai 2006 ) , which is capable of treating the global bifurcation problem of nonlinear pde s and obtaining the post - bifurcation solutions .",
    "we construct the solutions and extract from them important information on the deformation configurations , the nucleation stress , the instability phenomena and the transformation front .",
    "comparisons with experimental results are made , which show that the asymptotic solutions can capture the key features of the experimental engineering stress - strain curves and the instability phenomena as observed in experiments .",
    "the qualitative agreements give supporting evidence that a non - convex strain energy function can be used to describe solid - solid phase transitions and the instability phenomena in phase transformations are mainly due to the non - convexity of the strain energy function .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the field equations by treating the slender cylinder as a three - dimensional object . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out a non - dimensionalization process to extract the important small variable and two small parameters which characterize this problem .",
    "then we derive the normal form equation of the original governing nonlinear pde s in section 4 , through series and asymptotic expansions . in section 5 , we show that the euler - lagrange equation can also lead to the same normal form equation , which justifies our method in deriving this equation . in section 6 ,",
    "we propose the clamped boundary conditions . in section 7",
    ", we construct the asymptotic solutions for both a force - controlled problem and a displacement - controlled problem .",
    "we also use the solutions obtained to explain some experimental results .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider the axisymmetric deformations of a slender elastic cylinder subject to a static axial force at two ends .",
    "the lateral surface is traction - free and the end conditions will be considered later . in an undeformed state ,",
    "the radius of the cylinder is @xmath7 and the total length is @xmath8 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath9 .",
    "we take the cylindrical polar coordinate system and denote @xmath10 and @xmath11 the coordinates of a material point of the cylinder in the reference and current configurations , respectively .",
    "the finite radial and axial displacements can be written as @xmath12 we introduce the orthonormal bases associated with the cylindrical coordinates and denote these by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 in the reference and current configurations , respectively .",
    "then the deformation gradient tensor @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 for an hyperelastic material , the strain energy function @xmath21 is a function of the three invariants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the left cauchy - green strain tensor @xmath25 ; that is , @xmath26 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath21 is non - convex in a pure one - dimensional stress problem such that phase transition can take place .",
    "the nominal stress tensor @xmath27 is given by @xmath28    if the strains are small , it is possible to expand the nominal stress components in term of the strains up to any order .",
    "the formula containing terms up to the third order material nonlinearity is ( cf .",
    "fu @xmath0 ogden 1999 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the components of the tensor @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are incremental elastic moduli , which can be calculated once a specific form of the strain - energy function is given , and the formulas can be found in appendix a. from the formula ( 2.4 ) , we could obtain the nominal stress components @xmath35 .",
    "for example , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are some elastic moduli , whose formulas are given in appendix a. the other non - zero stress components can also be obtained but we omit their lengthy expressions for brevity .",
    "owing to the complexity of calculations , we shall only work up to the third - order material nonlinearity . in the experiments ,",
    "the maximum strain is less than @xmath40 , and such an approximation is sufficiently accurate .",
    "@xmath27 satisfies the following field equations : @xmath41 which yields the following equations @xmath42 @xmath43 we consider the case that the lateral surface of the cylinder is traction - free .",
    "thus , we have the boundary conditions @xmath44 we shall derive the asymptotic solutions of ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) under ( 2.9 ) and some end conditions for a given external force",
    ".    equations ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) together with ( 2.4 ) provide the governing equations for two unknowns @xmath2 and @xmath45 .",
    "the formal two are very complicated nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde s ) and the boundary conditions ( 2.9 ) are also complicated nonlinear relations ( cf .",
    "( 3.3)-(3.6 ) ) . to describe the instability phenomena during phase transitions , one need to study the bifurcations of this complicated system of nonlinear pde s . here",
    ", we shall adopt an alternative approach involving coupled series - asymptotic expansions to tackle this bifurcation problem .",
    "a similar methodology has been developed to study nonlinear waves and phase transitions in incompressible materials ( see dai @xmath0 huo 2002 , dai @xmath0 fan 2004 , dai @xmath0 cai 2006 , cai @xmath0 dai 2006 ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study phase transitions in a slender circular cylinder composed of a compressible hyperelastic material with a non - convex strain energy function . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to construct the asymptotic solutions based on an axisymmetrical three - dimensional setting and use the results to describe the key features ( in particular , instability phenomena ) observed in the experiments by others . </S>",
    "<S> the difficult problem of the solution bifurcations of the governing nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde s ) is solved through a novel approach . by using a methodology involving </S>",
    "<S> coupled series - asymptotic expansions , we derive the normal form equation of the original complicated system of nonlinear pde s . by writing the normal form equation into a first - order dynamical system and with a phase - plane analysis , we manage to deduce the global bifurcation properties and to solve the boundary - value problem analytically . the asymptotic solutions ( including post - bifurcation solutions ) in terms of integrals are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the engineering stress - strain curve plotted from the asymptotic solutions can capture the key features of the curve measured in a few experiments ( e.g. , the stress drop , the stress plateau , and the small stress valley ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the asymptotic solutions obtained shed certain light on the instability phenomena associated with phase transitions in a cylinder , in particular the role played by the radius - length ratio . </S>",
    "<S> also , an important feature of this work is that we consider the clamped end conditions , which are more practical but rarely used in literature for phase transition problems .    </S>",
