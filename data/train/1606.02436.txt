    "the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , ngc4696 , in the nearby centaurus cluster , abell 3526 , has a system of dusty h@xmath0 filaments ( fabian et al .",
    "1982 ; sparks et al .",
    "1989 , crawford et al 2005 ) connecting the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) with its active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the low star formation rate ( @xmath1 ) means that energy feedback into the icm via the agn - powered radio source has stifled almost all complete radiative cooling in the hot gas for billions of years , despite a central cooling time ( sanders et al .",
    "2008 , 2016 ) of only @xmath2 .",
    "the details of how feedback is so successful and the operation of key ingredients such as the heating of the hot gas , the behaviour of the cold gas , the lack of star formation , and the fuelling of the central back hole are unclear ( fabian 2012 ) .",
    "the filaments provide diagnostic information on the distribution and morphology of cold gas and its velocity field ( canning et al 2010 ) in the region where much of the central action takes place .",
    "the centaurus system is important since it is the nearest bcg with detected , extended , molecular gas .",
    "here we present hubble space telescope ( hst ) h@xmath0 images of the filaments which show that they are likely to be magnetically - supported in the hot gas , similar to the situation for the spectacular filament system around ngc1275 in the more distant perseus cluster ( fabian et al 2008 ) .",
    "the images also reveal an intriguing swirl in the cold gas at the bondi radius of the black hole .",
    "the temperature of the hot gas in the central 20 kpc radius of the centaurus cluster drops from 3 kev down to a mean of about 0.5kev .",
    "chandra observations show that the gas is multiphase within 10kpc with a 0.5 kev component extending over the 5 kpc radius region where the optical filaments are seen ( sanders et al 2016 ) .",
    "xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer data reveal strong fexvii emission lines from the 0.5 kev gas indicating that any complete cooling flow , which would be about @xmath3 if no heating took place , is reduced to below @xmath4 at temperatures below 0.4  kev ( sanders et al 2008 ) .",
    "the filaments consist of both an atomic component giving rise to the h@xmath0 emission , as well as [ nii ] , [ oii ] , oi , [ siii ] characteristic of lowly - ionized gas , significant masses of cold gas indicated by [ cii ] emission ( mittal et al 2011 ) and a molecular component is seen in h@xmath5 rotational lines with spitzer ( johnstone et al 2007 ) .",
    "the low - ionization optical and near infrared emission spectrum of the filaments strongly indicates that energetic particles are responsible for heating and excitation of the cold gas ( ferland et al 2009 ) .",
    "these are either due to penetration of the cold gas by the surrounding hot gas ( fabian et al 2011 ) or internal particles energised by magnetic reconnection as the filaments move around ( churazov , ruszkowski & schekochihin 2013 ) .",
    "if it is by penetration then the filaments are growing at the expense of the hot gas at a few @xmath6 .",
    "unlike the filaments in ngc1275 , those in ngc4696 contain dust lanes , first reported by shobbrook ( 1963 ) , which contrasts with the ngc1275 filaments for which no dust lanes have been detected .",
    "dust has also been detected in emission with spitzer ( kaneda et al 2007 ) and herschel ( mittal et al 2011 ) with a total cold dust mass of @xmath7 . in comparison with the total molecular mass",
    ", the dust - to- gas ratio appears to be normal .",
    "comparison of the dust extinction in the r and v bands shows ( sparks et al 1989 ) that to be normal also .",
    "the redshift of ngc4696 is 0.0104 and we adopt @xmath8",
    "10.5 hst orbits were obtained with wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) using redshifted h@xmath0 filter f665n .",
    "this filter includes the h@xmath0 and [ nii ] emission lines with [ nii ] being the stronger component : for simplicity we refer to the combined emission as h@xmath0 .",
    "the images were drizzled together and a smoothed galaxy continuum model subtracted to give fig .",
    "the filaments are resolved with a width of about 60 pc ( fig .",
    "more details of the reduction of the data are given in the appendix .",
    "+ [ nii ] image of ngc4696 . ]         detection of co(2 - 1 ) in ngc4696 ]     filaments , demonstrating remarkable unformity . ]",
    "a @xmath9 detection of co emission has been made using the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex , fig .",
    "3 ) . using a milky way conversion factor ( bolatto et al 2013 ) we obtain a molecular mass of about @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio of total h@xmath0 luminosity ( canning et al 2011 ) of @xmath11 to co luminosity is similar to that of other bcg systems ( edge et al 2001 ; salom & combes 2003 ) .    assuming that this ratio is constant over the ngc4696 filament system",
    ", we find from the h@xmath0 surface brightness that the linear mass density of the filaments is about @xmath12 .",
    "the mean density of a filament then corresponds to about 3 protons @xmath13 which is about 10 times denser than the surrounding hot gas .",
    "of course the density of the molecular gas within a filament must correspond to much higher values : the thermal pressure is about @xmath14 so the co component is plausibly denser than @xmath15 .",
    "the filaments are not continuous cold structures but must contain smaller dense structures or threads ( fabian et al 2008 ) .    inspection of the outer filaments suggests that they have similar surface brightness .",
    "this is confirmed using half - arcsec wide bins placed along the filaments , giving the peaked surface brightness histogram shown in fig .",
    "this is consistent with the icm particle heating model ( fabian et al 2011 ) where heating and excitation is the result of the uniform flux of hot icm particles , provided that the covering fraction of a filament is high , despite the low volume filling factor .",
    "the shape of the filaments to the e strongly suggests that they are being drawn outward by the outflowing hot gas as part of the bubbling cycle .",
    "consider the bright filament arc 19 arcsec to the ese of the nucleus , just outside the western bubble ( fig .",
    "5 ) , which has radius , @xmath16 and thickness @xmath17 . assuming that the hot gas , density @xmath18 , dragging the arc out at velocity @xmath19 is balanced by an internal magnetic field @xmath20 , then @xmath21 from which we deduce that @xmath22 , which equals the thermal pressure ( sanders et al 2016 ) , assuming a reasonable value for the drag velocity ( canning et al 2011 ) of @xmath23 @xmath24 corresponds to the x - ray measured value ( sanders et al 2016 ) at that radius of 0.3 particles @xmath13 .",
    "we can also consider the magnetic support of a radial filament of length @xmath25 against tidal force to give a further value ( fabian et al 2008 ) of @xmath20 , @xmath26        we obtain @xmath27 using the value of the gravitational acceleration @xmath28 from sanders et al ( 2016 ) .",
    "this value is similar to that found ( fabian et al 2008 ) for the filaments in ngc1275 .    the strong faraday rotation seen in the radio source ( fig .",
    "5 ) is interpreted as due to a mean line - of - sight magnetic field , @xmath29 , in the @xmath30 component of the inner hot gas ( taylor et al 2007 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetic pressure about 10 per cent of the thermal pressure .",
    "filaments are thus magnetised structures embedded in a less magnetised icm .",
    "note that if hot gas at fixed temperature is clumped so that its volume filling factor is @xmath31 , then the value of @xmath20 deduced from faraday rotation scales as @xmath32 .",
    "we have used the depth of dust absorption in the filaments to make a rough assessment of their location along the line of sight ( gillmon et al 2004 ) .",
    "the starlight of the galaxy will fill in the absorption if the filaments are close to the centre .",
    "6 displays the radius from the centre of ngc4696 at which the lowest flux in a dust patch matches the flux in that band from the galaxy .",
    "most of the prominent outer filaments are then situated 4 - 5 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "we presume that the filaments without any obvious dust absorption are on the other side of the galaxy .",
    "an abundance drop is seen in chandra x - ray spectral imaging of the centre of ngc4696 with iron peaking at @xmath33 at a radius of 15  kpc and dropping inward to @xmath34 in the innermost @xmath35 ( panagoulia , fabian & sanders 2013 ) .",
    "this can be explained if iron and many other metals injected by stellar mass - loss in the central region are locked up in grains which contribute to the filamentary nebula .",
    "the quasi - continuous bubbling process drags the filaments outward and dumps them beyond 10 kpc where they mix and join the icm .",
    "an approximate steady state is reached if about 10 per cent of the dusty filament mass is dragged out every cycle ( panagoulia et al 2013 ) , which corresponds to a mean outflow rate of @xmath36 .    in fig .",
    "7 , we show the xmm rgs spectrum from the inner region of the cluster core of width 5 kpc .",
    "emission lines from fexvii , characteristic of gas at 0.5 kev temperature are seen as well as a 3@xmath37 detection of the ovii triplet near 22 a from gas at 0.2 kev .",
    "the latter corresponds to a radiative cooling rate of @xmath38 over the temperature range 0.3 to 0.05 kev , assuming solar abundances .",
    "we have no clear evidence that the gas is cooling but note that the radiative cooling time of the 2 mk component is only @xmath39 .",
    "the gas may however be part of the mixing interface between the cold filaments and the hot surrounding medium ( chatzikos et al 2015 ) .",
    "a filament is therefore a quasi - linear aggregation of dense cold knots having a combined covering factor of unity over a width of about 60 pc , linked together by strong magnetic fields , permeated and surrounded by a volume - filling hot component at about @xmath40 .",
    "the hot component is itself magnetized but to a lesser level than the embedded filaments .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mass of cold gas with that of the surrounding hot gas .",
    "the electron density of the hot gas in the central 30 kpc is approximately ( sanders et al 2016 ) @xmath41 .",
    "the ( projected ) h@xmath0 emission scales as @xmath42 so , assuming that the cold gas mass scales similarly , the region within 0.5 kpc of the nucleus is dominated by cold gas .",
    "the bondi radius for accretion , @xmath43 , onto the central black hole is 70 pc if we assume that the volume - filling component is the cooler x - ray emitting gas at @xmath44 and use a black hole mass @xmath45 .",
    "the mass of the central black hole in ngc4696 has not yet been measured directly , but this is the mass deduced using the measured stellar velocity dispersion ( bernardi et al 2002 ) @xmath46 applied to the @xmath47 relation ( mcconnell & ma 2013 ) .",
    "the proximity and likely high mass of the black hole in ngc4696 mean that its accretion radius is one of very few in an active system which is currently resolvable .",
    "the hst imaging shows that the h@xmath0 emission peaks near the nucleus coincident with a swirling s - shape or total diameter 1 arcsec ( 210 pc ) , which presents a similar aspect to that of the much larger filament system ( fig .",
    "most of the swirl lies just outside or within the bondi radius and presumably indicates that the flow proceeds as a connected structure , rather than a chaotic rain of cold blobs ( see gaspari , brighenti & temi 2015 ) for hydrodynamic simulations of a blobby inflow ) . the total mass of gas in the stream , assuming a constant h@xmath0 to gas mass ratio , is about @xmath48 which must accrete slowly to match the accretion rate required by the radio source of about @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the radiative efficiency in units of 0.1 .",
    "( the free - fall time from the bondi radius is about @xmath51 . )",
    "there is again the old problem ( fabian & canizares 1988 ) of `` why is the nucleus of many local massive ellipticals dead ? '' when there is sufficient gas to make them as active as quasars .",
    "this time it involves cold rather than hot gas .",
    "the swirling structure strongly indicates that the gaseous atmosphere around the bondi radius is slowly rotating and the filamentary appearance means that magnetic fields remain important .",
    "angular momentum may stem the inflow at radii smaller than resolved here .",
    "it is possible that the hot phase in the inner few 100 pc participates in a giant advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf : narayan & fabian 2011 ) . estimating the accretion rate when the gas is highly multiphase is difficult , but the region is not starved of cold gas , which forms the dominant component    the h@xmath0 brightest patch coincides with a radio knot imaged by the vlba ( fig .",
    "9 ; taylor et al 2006 ) and could be where the outgoing jet passes close to the gas stream .",
    "a continuation outward along the jet leads to a fuv source , which could be a synchrotron knot or hotspot in the jet .",
    "the jet structures explain the `` double nucleus '' reported earlier ( laine et al 2003 ) and the emission attributed to central star formation tremblay et al ( 2015 ) .",
    "emission from the innermost few arcsec around the nucleus ( marked by a cross ) , revealing a 150pc swirl of gas ]    it should be possible to map the velocity of the swirling cold gas with the full array of alma or in the optical / ir band with adaptive optics or hst spectroscopy .",
    "hst imaging has resolved the dusty molecular filaments in ngc4696 to be about 60 pc in width , slightly less than the filaments around ngc1275 in the perseus cluster .",
    "the surface brightness of the outer filaments appears to be constant on a half arcsec scale .",
    "the filaments near the centre appear brighter , possibly due to the overlap of filaments along our line of sight .",
    "estimates of the magnetic field required to support the filaments as they are drawn out with the hot gas and against tidal forces indicate that they are in rough equipartition with the hot gas .",
    "magnetic fields in the hot gas compatible with faraday rotation measures from the extended radio source are about one third of this value .",
    "the lack of star formation is probably due to the strong internal magnetic field ( fabian et al 2008 ) .",
    "the critical surface density for gravitational instability in the presence of a magnetic field is given ( zweibel et al 1993 ) by @xmath52 ; for @xmath53 g this requires @xmath54 for collapse .",
    "the transverse column density in a filament is about 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than this value , so the filaments should be stable against gravitational collapse and subsequent star formation .    the hot gas in the central few kpc ( fig .",
    "10 ) is multiphase with components detected around 1 kev , 0.5 kev and also 0.2 kev , by xmm spectroscopy and chandra imaging .",
    "the ratios of the components are not compatible with a simple cooling flow , although a sporadic flow of a few @xmath55 may occur .",
    "there is however no sign of any star formation .",
    "the hst imaging has resolved the bondi radius of the central black hole where we find a large 100 pc radius swirl of gas .",
    "the surroundings of the swirl are also filamentary , suggesting that magnetic fields are dynamically important in the cold gas at all radii .",
    "the behaviour of the inner gas of this massive elliptical galaxy , and probably many other such galaxies , is mediated by strong magnetic fields in both the hot gas and the embedded cold , molecular , filaments .",
