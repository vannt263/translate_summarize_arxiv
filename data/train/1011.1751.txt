    "it was created in 1894 by lord rayleigh to describe the vibrations of a string  @xcite and adapted to quantum mechanics by schrdinger in 1926  @xcite .",
    "rs perturbation theory has been used in all fields of quantum physics ( particle , atomic , molecular , solid - state physics ) and quantum chemistry .    in most textbooks , the rs series deals with the perturbation of a single nondegenerate initial state . however , in many practical applications , the initial state is either degenerate or quasidegenerate ( i.e. several states are close in energy ) and the basic rs approach breaks down .",
    "quasidegenerate perturbation theory is widely used to set up effective hamiltonians  @xcite , for example the spin hamiltonians of molecular chemistry and solid state physics  @xcite , or to deal with the quantum electrodynamics of atoms  @xcite .",
    "the terms of the rs series are notoriously complex .",
    "even mathematical physicists of the stature of reed and simon admit that the terms of the rs series are `` quite complicated '' and that `` the higher order rs coefficients are hard to compute '' ( see ref .  , p.  8 and 18 ) .",
    "computer programs are available to build the terms of the rs series  @xcite , but their results are intricate expressions that do not exhibit any obvious structure and that can hardly be used to carry out resummations of the series .    in this paper , combinatorial physics",
    "is used to provide the first representation of the general term of the rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) perturbation theory for quasidegenerate systems .",
    "each term is written as a tree that faithfully reflects its algebraic structure .",
    "in particular , trees illustrate the recursive structure of rs terms , that is used to prove properties of the rs series .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe the general term of the rs series and to illustrate the power of our combinatorial approach by deriving a number of possible resummations of the rs series .",
    "our aim is to set up the tools for performing such resummations and not to discuss when some resummations are more convenient than others . as a consequence",
    ", no numerical example is given .    when the system is not quasi - degenerate ( i.e. when it is either fully degenerate or non - degenerate ) , several graphical representations of the terms of the rs series have been proposed .",
    "we give the bijection between these representations and our trees .",
    "in the most general setting , we consider a model space @xmath2 spanned by @xmath3 eigenstates @xmath4 of @xmath1 , with energies @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that all @xmath5 of the model space are separated from the rest of the spectrum of @xmath1 by a finite gap .",

    ", the basic rs series has been dealt with in hundreds of papers . as a starting point to discover the proper combinatorial structure of the rs series , we enumerate the number of its terms : it has one term of order 0 , one term of order 1 , then 2 , 5 , 14 , 42 , 132 , 429 terms of order 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the number of terms of order @xmath36 is the catalan number @xmath37 .",
    "the catalan sequence is well - know in combinatorics : `` the catalan sequence is probably the most frequently encountered sequence that is still obscure enough to cause mathematicians [  ] to expend inordinate amounts of energy re - discovering formulas that were worked out long ago . ''",
    "an entire book is devoted to catalan numbers  @xcite .",
    "they enumerate over 200 combinatorial objects  @xcite and in the physics literature , several of these objects were used to represent the general term of the rs series : dyck paths  @xcite , non - crossing partitions  @xcite , bracketings  @xcite , labelled diagrams  @xcite and sequences of integers  @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches could not be generalized to quasi - degenerate systems because they dealt with denominators @xmath38 with @xmath39 , whereas more complex denominators occur in the quasi - degenerate case .",
    "moreover , they could not be used to discover efficient resummations because they do not capture the recursive structure of the rs series .    to find out which combinatorial object is best suited to deal with the rs series , we had to use a rather elaborate algebraic analysis of the time - dependent perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it turned out in the end that planar binary trees provide the most faithful representation . as we shall see , the relation beween a tree and the corresponding term of rs series is straightforward and the recursive structure of the terms is transparent",
    ". the faithfulness is demonstrated by the easiness of the proofs and by the relation between geometrical properties of the trees and analytical properties of the terms , for instance for resummation .",

    "this bijection is illustrated in tables  [ tab123 ] and [ tab4 ] .",
    "the terms of the rs series of degenerate systems can also be described by non - crossing partitions .",
    "this correspondence was studied by olszewski  @xcite because it leads to useful factorizations of the rs terms for non - degenerate systems .",
    "consider the examples at the beginning of section  [ bijection - sect ] .",
    "if we just look at the denominators , we see that each of them can be deduced from the right comb by saying that some indices are equal . for the five trees with @xmath377",

    "the other terms follow from @xmath381 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 .",
    "more generally , for a given tree @xmath59 , we say that two indices @xmath384 and @xmath78 are equivalent if and only if @xmath385 in the denominator of @xmath76 .",
    "the sets of equivalent indices form a partition of @xmath386 .",
    "we recall that a partition @xmath387 of @xmath388 is a set of disjoint subsets @xmath389 of @xmath388 whose union is @xmath388 .",
    "each subset @xmath389 is called a block of the partition .",
    "the partitions corresponding to the rs terms of order 1 to 3 are given in table  [ tab123 ] and for order 4 in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "it will be shown that these partitions are _ non - crossing_. two blocks @xmath23 and @xmath24 of a partition are said to be crossing if there are @xmath390 in @xmath23 and @xmath391 in @xmath24 such that @xmath392 or @xmath393 .",
    "a partition is called non - crossing if no two of its blocks cross .",

    "a tree of order @xmath36 has @xmath57 leaves .",
    "thus , the index of the rightmost leaf is not used in the partition .    for a given tree @xmath70 , we call @xmath32 ( @xmath394 , @xmath395 , respectively ) the partition corresponding to @xmath59 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , respectively ) . we consider the usual four cases .",
    "( i ) for @xmath348 we associate the partition @xmath396 .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath250 and @xmath75 , eq .  ( [ rect1 ] ) gives us the additional denominator @xmath397 .",
    "therefore , an additional index is equivalent to 1 .",
    "this index is that of the rightmost leaf of @xmath51 , which was not used in @xmath394 .",
    "therefore , the partition @xmath32 of @xmath59 is obtained from @xmath394 by adding to the block of @xmath394 containing 1 the index of the rightmost leaf of @xmath51 , which is @xmath398 .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath73 and @xmath365 , eq .",
    "( [ rec1 t ] ) gives us the additional denominator @xmath397 .",
    "however , the leaf denoted by 1 is new and no block of @xmath395 should contain it .",
    "therefore , the partition @xmath32 of @xmath59 is obtained from @xmath395 by increasing all numbers of @xmath395 by 1 and by adding the block @xmath279 .",
    "( iv ) for @xmath250 and @xmath365 , we compose the previous cases .",

    "the relation with non - crossing partitions is straightforward : all points that are pinched together belong to the same block of the partition .",
    "however , his correspondence between partitions and terms of the rs series is not the same as ours .      following a suggestion by brueckner  @xcite , huby and tong  @xcite proposed , for the energy of nondegenerate systems , a solution in terms of bracketing , that is isomorphic with stanley s problem @xmath399 in his `` catalan addendum '' .",

    "we use tong s pictorial representation , where @xmath403 is replaced by @xmath405 , @xmath77 by @xmath406 , @xmath407 by @xmath408 and @xmath231 by @xmath409 , so that @xmath410 .",
    "the bracketings for @xmath58=1,2 and 3 are given in table  [ tab123 ] and for order 4 in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "brueckner s bracketing is a powerful way to simplify the rs series , for instance by including the vacuum expectation value @xmath411 into @xmath1 , so that all rs terms involving it cancel .",
    "more details and examples can be found in some textbooks  @xcite or review papers  @xcite .",
    "we now describe the connection between trees and bracketings .",
