    ", the decoherence process can be quite fast due to coupling to a large number of internal degrees of freedom .",

    "a less well understood , but very relevant case for solid - state quantum architectures is that of a qubit coupled to a fermionic bath,@xcite which dramatically differs from the previous examples . in this paper",
    "we study quantum decoherence in the context of a superconducting charge qubit@xcite interacting with the non - trivial bath of andreev fluctuators.@xcite this problem is a paradigmatic spin - fermion decoherence problem and applies to many situations involving the quantum coupling of a qubit ( `` spin '' ) to a general fermionic environment . using a many - body keldysh path integral approach,@xcite we obtain a quantum - mechanical description of the qubit evolution under pulse sequences aimed at prolonging the coherence of the system .",
    "the simplest case of decoherence under pulses is the spin echo dephasing experiment , which has been shown to extend the coherence time of solid state ( superconducting ) qubits,@xcite by essentially eliminating the quasi - static shifts of qubit energy splitting ( inhomogeneous broadening ) due to the slow environmental fluctuations .",
    "however , sequences involving more pulses , for example ,  cpmg  @xcite and uhrig s @xcite sequences , are expected to lead to a further increase of the coherence time.@xcite    in this paper , we consider an experimentally relevant example - a superconducting qubit coupled to fluctuating background charges,@xcite e.g.  electrons residing on anderson - impurity sites . due to a large on - site coulomb repulsion forbidding double occupancy",
    ", this example represents a non - trivial interacting bath .",
    "the dynamics of the charge fluctuations on the impurity sites is determined by the hybridization of impurity levels with the quasiparticle band of the superconductor . to the lowest order in tunneling at the superconductor / insulator interface",
    ", the hybridization of the impurity levels can be described by a correlated tunneling events of two electrons with opposite spin to / from the superconductor .",
    "we show that in the small background - charge density limit , these fluctuations lead to a @xmath0 spectral density of noise . using these results , we finally obtain the quantum - mechanical description of the qubit evolution driven by external pulses , and discuss optimal strategy for the suppression of the decoherence with designed composite pulse sequences .",
