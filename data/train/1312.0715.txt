    "quantum computation is a subject that is strongly attracting the interest of the physics community in recent times @xcite , mainly because of the vast potential it has for extremely high - performance calculations .",
    "the main reason for that derives from the fact that instead of employing a binary system as the basic computing unit , it uses the infinitely many quantum states obtained by coherent linear combinations of certain base states .",
    "loss of quantum coherence through interaction with the environment , however , is a fatal threat for a quantum computer , since it implies complete loss of information . for this reason it is important to find systems , capable of performing the required operations of quantum computation , being at the same time protected against the process of decoherence .",
    "systems presenting non - abelian statistics can provide the required stability through the mechanism known as topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "for these systems , exchanging particles in a many - particle state produces the entanglement thereof , thus making them robust against decoherence . an intense search for many - particle systems presenting such peculiar behavior under the particle exchange  or braiding  operation",
    "has then started .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the non - abelian chern - simons field in 2 + 1 d , minimally coupled to a higgs field in the adjoint representation of the su(2 ) group ( the csh - theory ) .",
    "the higgs field potential is such that there are two phases according to whether the vacuum expectation value of this field vanishes or not .",
    "we study in detail the quantum magnetic vortex excitations of this system in the ordered phase . in order to accomplish the full quantization of such excitations",
    ", we apply to the csh - theory the method of quantization of topological excitations , which is based on the concept of order - disorder duality @xcite .",
    "we obtain , in particular , the explicit form of the creation operator of quantum excitations carrying both magnetic flux and charge , as well as their euclidean correlation functions .",
    "these electrically charged magnetic vortices may be boson , fermion or , more generally anyons .",
    "we show that special self - adjoint combinations of vortices and anti - vortices possess non - abelian statistics whenever the vortices are anyonic .",
    "furthermore , for a specific value of the anyon spin , namely @xmath0 , we show that we can construct the not and cnot logic gates , required in quantum computation , from the corresponding monodromy matrices .",
    "our results , based on a fully quantized approach of topological excitations , therefore show that the csh model with an su(2 ) group is an excellent example of a system exhibiting the requisites needed for the operation of a quantum computer .",
    "related results have been reported in the literature .",
    "for instance , non - abelian statistics has been obtained for certain quasi - particle excitations of the quantum hall liquid @xcite and also for ising anyons @xcite .",
    "models inspired in non - abelian anyons have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the su(2 ) non - abelian chern - simons theory to which we couple a higgs field in the adjoint representation : @xmath1 = \\frac{\\kappa}{4\\pi}\\int d^{3}z\\,\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\left(a^{a}_{\\mu } \\partial_{\\nu}a^{a}_{\\rho } + \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\epsilon^{abc}a^{a}_{\\mu } a^{b}_{\\nu}a^{c}_{\\rho}\\right ) + \\mbox{tr}d_{\\mu}\\phi d^{\\mu}\\phi - v(\\vert \\phi\\vert , \\eta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the higgs self - interaction potential is given by @xcite @xmath2    the euler - lagrange equation is @xmath3 where @xmath4^{a}$ ] .",

    "these two quantities are given respectively by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an unit vector , subject to the action of the group ( for instance @xmath13 where @xmath14 ) and @xmath15    in order to construct the local operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we will follow the method for quantization of topological excitations that was developed with basis on the order - disorder duality @xcite . according to this ,",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 operators act , respectively , as order and disorder operators and therefore satisfy the corresponding dual algebra .",
    "then , correlation functions determined by this algebra are obtained by coupling certain special external fields to the dynamical fields of the system . in the case of the @xmath10-operator these external fields",
    "are given by @xmath16 , whereas , for the @xmath9-operator , by @xmath17 where @xmath18    and    @xmath19    in the above expressions @xmath20 is the covariantized vector surface integration element , perpendicular to the integration surface @xmath21 .",
