    "it is a well established fact that evaluations devoted to describe quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transitions need to be done in a nonperturbative fashion , such as numerically solving it on the lattice ( lqcd )  @xcite , which nowadays is considered the most reliable way to tackle the problem at vanishing densities .",
    "unfortunately , lqcd is still plagued by the so - called sign problem  @xcite which prevents the method to be used to describe the transitions expected to take place at lower temperatures and higher densities .",
    "on the other hand , multi - loop perturbative results for many qcd physical quantities are within reach so that an appealing alternative would be to use them in conjunction with some resummation procedure in order to generate nonperturbative results . in this vein , different analytical techniques envisaged to combine the easiness of purely perturbative evaluations with nonperturbative optimization",
    "/ resummation procedures have been proposed in the past decades  @xcite .",
    "some of these methods are based on a reorganization of a given interacting lagrangian , so that it becomes written in terms of an arbitrary mass parameter which , for massless theories , also works as an infrared regulator ( as in hard thermal loop resummations  @xcite ) .",
    "one of these approaches is the so - called screened perturbation theory ( spt )  @xcite , in which the variational parameter is described by a thermal mass .",
    "the spt was originally proposed to describe the thermodynamics of massless scalar theories , but it has been later generalized so that the equation of state of thermal gauge - invariant theories  @xcite , such as qcd , could also be obtained .",
    "this gauge invariant generalization known as hard thermal loop ( resummed ) perturbation theory ( htlpt )  @xcite , has been already used to calculate qcd thermodynamic functions up to three loop order at finite values of the temperature and chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "the spt and htlpt are actually conceptually similar to the so - called linear delta expansion ( lde ) and optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) , developed earlier under various different names  @xcite mainly in the context of zero - temperature field theories . within this technique ,",
    "perturbative evaluations are performed using propagators written in terms of an arbitrary mass parameter , so that optimized nonperturbative results can be generated by requiring the mass parameter to satisfy a variational criterion .",
    "the two major problems the above mentioned methods try to solve are the poor convergence and the notoriously bad scale - dependence of the standard perturbative series both for the thermal mass and for the pressure at higher orders ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) : not only the increasing perturbative orders show no clear sign of stability , but the scale - dependence worsens substantially at higher orders , at odds with what is intuitively expected for most known perturbative series at @xmath4 .",
    "part of this bad behavior is commonly explained  @xcite by the unavoidable complicated interplay of soft and hard thermal contributions . actually , the dynamical generation of a thermal screening mass @xmath5 influences the relevant expansion of physical quantities , such as the pressure , which are then expressed in powers of @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the predictions are , a priori , less convergent than for the @xmath4 case , yet most of the interesting thermal physics happens at rather moderate coupling values , so that one could expect a better behavior . despite the unavoidable @xmath8  nonperturbative \" dependence , both spt @xcite and opt  @xcite applications to hot scalar theory show how these methods indeed improve the stability of the predictions when higher orders in the loop expansion are considered .",
    "given the inherent technical difficulties associated with the ( three loop ) evaluation of the qcd pressure for the case of hot and dense quark matter , the recent results in @xcite represent an impressive achievement .",
    "however , the same results exhibit a substantial _ increasing _ scale - dependence at increasing two- and three - loop orders , even for moderately large coupling values , which remains a surprising issue .",
    "this is more pronounced for htlpt in qcd applications at the three loop level @xcite . while the latter are sometimes remarkably close to lattice results for temperatures down to @xmath9 $ \\sim$}}~}2 t_c$ ] , for the central renormalization scale choice @xmath10 in the @xmath11-scheme , it appears puzzling that a moderate scale variation of a factor 2 dramatically affects the pressure and related thermodynamical quantities by relative variations of order 1 or more .",
    "it is argued  @xcite that resumming the logarithmic dependence of htlpt results may improve this problem , but as we shall explain below the missing rg invariance properties is more basic within the spt / htlpt approach .",
    "+ recently , the standard opt procedure at zero temperature has been modified to incorporate consistently perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) properties .",
    "it was shown to considerably improve the convergence of opt , as tested for the gross - neveu ( gn ) model mass gap  @xcite , and further used to determine with a good accuracy the basic qcd scale in the @xmath12 scheme , @xmath13 , and corresponding value of the strong coupling @xmath14@xcite .",
    "very recently the same method has been used to estimate  @xcite the qcd chiral quark condensate . here , we extend the construction to the case of a scalar theory with quartic interaction to show how this rg improved opt ( rgopt ) can easily cope with the introduction of control parameters such as the temperature , developing in detail the construction presented very recently in  @xcite . using this textbook example",
    "we aim to illustrate how the rgopt takes care of the scale dependence problems of thermal theories , those being more clearly visible within the spt @xcite and htlpt higher loop results  @xcite , but also present in other resummation approaches .",
    "+ in a nutshell , leaving aside technical details , our basic observation is that the arbitrary variational mass introduced in the spt / opt context can ( and should ) be treated as any  proper \" mass , from the rg viewpoint . in particular",
    ", this means that it involves its own standard anomalous dimension , which is unrelated to the coupling @xmath15 function , and should be incorporated consistently within rg properties .",
    "this brings crucial consequences already on the form of an explicitly rg - invariant pressure , prior to any further improved / resummed perturbation approaches .",
    "it also more clearly separates the hard and soft modes from a rg / scale dependence perspective , at least in an intermediate stage of the calculations . in the more standard approach",
    "both contributions are mixed up since all relevant quantities are expressed as a function of the coupling and temperature only .",
    "that being accepted , one realizes that most of the observed worsening scale - dependence at higher orders is actually due to a manifest failure of rg invariance for a massive theory .",
    "this is at least particularly transparent in the @xmath11 scheme largely used within spt / htlpt methods , where we show that minimally subtracting the vacuum energy divergences , without finite vacuum energy contributions , explicitly misses rg invariance .",
    "+ in addition , even when starting from an explicitly rg invariant perturbative expression , rg invariance is generally lost as a consequence of the standard ( linear ) modification of perturbative expansion implied in opt / spt , a fact that has been seldom appreciated in the relevant literature so far .",
    "however , rg properties can easily be restored by a consistent use of renormalization group properties for a massive theory , automatically incorporated in the rgopt approach  @xcite , whereby a drastically improved scale - dependence follows naturally .",
    "this opens up the possibility of rather simply exploiting many non - trivial spt / htlpt results performed up to three - loop order so far , by improving substantially their scale independence after applying appropriate rgopt adaptations .",
    "+ incidentally , other resummation approaches , like typically the so - called  two - loop-@xmath16-derivable \" approach , ( related to the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) method )  @xcite are manifestly scale invariant when applied to the scalar model in a certain approximation .",
    "in fact one observes interesting analogies ( but also important differences ) between the first non - trival ( two - loop ) 2pi order and our _ one - loop _ rgopt results , as will be elaborated in more detail below .",
    "however , as it happens the scale - invariance of the above - mentioned 2pi results  @xcite is essentially due to a renormalization that appears peculiar to the scalar model , inspired by the properties of the @xmath2 symmetric theory in the large-@xmath1 limit  @xcite ( for which indeed the two - loop-@xmath16-derivable 2pi results become exact ) . thus , to the best of our understanding",
    ", this scale invariance appears somewhat accidental and difficult to translate to higher orders and to qcd .",
    "incidentally , the 2pi approach has been pushed even to three - loop order for the @xmath17 theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , with remarkably stable results with respect to two - loop order , but the method becomes more involved , and a definite scale - dependence reappears , although much more moderate than in the three - loop order spt and htlpt cases .",
    "other approaches like the nonperturbative renormalization group ( nprg )  @xcite , should be rg invariant by construction . but solving the relevant nprg equations for thermal qcd beyond approximative truncation schemes becomes very involved in practice .",
    "we also remark that our approach shares some qualitative features with the ideas invoked and the framework developed very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors explored some form of massive renormalization scheme and its consequences .",
    "however , the rgopt differs substantially in its approach as it incorporates by construction @xcite all relevant rg properties systematically order by order , relying basically on standard perturbation theory .",
    "being largely based on ( but not limited to ) @xmath11-scheme results , the rgopt can easily be extended to any higher order calculations performed in the framework of different models , when already available , including thermal qcd .",
    "therefore , it appears to us that the method presented here is conceptually simpler than other more sophisticated resummation approaches mentioned above .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we quickly review some basic results of thermal scalar theory for the free energy at the relevant two - loop level .",
    "then , in section 3 we address in some details the rg ( non ) invariance issue in the massive case , paying special attention to the @xmath11 scheme largely used in the spt ( or the similar htlpt ) method . in the same section",
    "we also explain how to restore the perturbative rg invariance at arbitrary orders in a simple fashion .",
    "next , the resummation by optimized perturbation ( opt ) , with the crucial modification to maintain its perturbative rg invariance , rgopt , is discussed in rather general terms in sections 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "the method is then illustrated in details by evaluating the free energy of a hot scalar field theory at one- and two - loop level in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "we emphasize that all the construction developed in secs .",
    "3 to 7 for the @xmath17 model ( for which we also briefly consider the large-@xmath1 case ) is actually more general , most of it being straightforwardly applicable to thermal qcd .",
    "we occasionally mention some properties anticipated to be similar ( or eventually different ) in the qcd case .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 8 , and one appendix deals with some technical details on the rg - invariant construction of counterterms .",
    "we consider , as a starting point , the massive scalar field theory described by the lagrangian density = _ ^-^2 - ^4 ; [ lphi4 ] where we introduce a ( yet unspecified ) generic mass term ( @xmath18 ) which can be thought as a thermal mass generated by higher perturbative orders in an originally massless theory .",
    "one may then evaluate the free energy using known results from ordinary perturbation theory for the massive case .",
    "then , up to the two - loop level the basic expression of the ( bare ) free energy is formally  @xcite : _ 0 = _ p ( p^2+m^2 ) + ( _ p ) ^2 + f_0^ct , [ 2lbasic ] where the temperature is introduced via matsubara s imaginary time formalism ( @xmath19 with the bosonic matsubara @xmath20 ) and we have also defined _",
    "p ( e^_e ) ^t _ n .",
    "the divergent integrals are regulated using dimensional regularization techniques with @xmath21 while renormalization is carried out in the @xmath11-scheme .",
    "the term @xmath22 represents all the relevant counterterms contributions to @xmath23 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "after all the mass , coupling , and vacuum energy counterterms have been consistently introduced to cancel the original divergences , one obtains the ( @xmath11-scheme ) renormalized free energy  @xcite : ( 4)^2 f_0 = e_0 - m^4 - t^4 j_0 ( ) + \\ { m^2 -t^2 j_1 ( ) } ^2 , [ f02l ] where we have explicitly separated the thermal and non - thermal contributions for later convenience . here and in all related renormalized expressions below , @xmath24 represents the arbitrary renormalization scale introduced by dimensional regularization in the @xmath11-scheme , and @xmath25 .",
    "note carefully in eq.([f02l ] ) that @xmath26 represents a possible _ finite _ vacuum energy term which is usually ignored , i.e. minimally set to zero in the ( thermal ) literature  @xcite .",
    "however , within our approach this quantity is necessarily non - zero and plays a crucial role as will become clear in the sequel .",
    "+ the standard ( dimensionless ) thermal integrals appearing in eq.([f02l ] ) are given by j_n(x ) = 4 _ 0^dt , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "different integrals can be easily related by employing derivatives such as j_n+1(x ) = - j_n(x ) . also , a high-@xmath29 expansion such as j_0(x ) ^4 -4 x^2 + 8 x^3 + x^4 + o(x^6 ) , [ j0exp ] is often useful since it represents a rather good approximation as long as @xmath30 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath29 larger than @xmath18 . + finally , for later comparison we recall that the thermal screening mass ( @xmath31 ) , defined  @xcite by the pole of the ( static ) propagator , is obtained for weak coupling for the massless theory as a perturbative series which to lowest orders reads  @xcite : = \\{1 - 6 ( ) ^1/2 -()+o(^3/2 ) } .",
    "we now discuss the lack of rg invariance when @xmath26 is minimally set to zero in eq.([f02l ] ) .",
    "remark first that to obtain ( [ f02l ] ) , calculations have been performed with an arbitrary mass @xmath18 in the dressed propagators ( mainly to subsequently treat it variationally in the opt / spt approach ) , with no prejudice at this stage that it should be a thermal mass of order @xmath32 in the actually massless theory .",
    "thus from the rg viewpoint , everything in ( [ f02l ] ) should behave as if it was a genuine massive theory , in particular the mass should have its standard anomalous dimension .",
    "recall that the ( homogeneous ) rg operator acting on a physical quantity with mass dependence , such as the free energy in the present case , is defined as = + ( ) + _ m()m , [ rgop ] where our normalization for the @xmath15 function is ( ) = b_0 ^2 + b_1 ^3 + [ beta ] while for the anomalous mass dimension it is given by _",
    "m ( ) = _ 0 + _ 1 ^2 + [ gamma ] with  @xcite ( 4)^2 b_0 = 3 ; ( 4)^2 _ 0 = ; ( 4)^4 b_1 = - , ( 4)^4 _ 1 = - .",
    "[ rgcoeff ] it is easy to see that the renormalized expression , eq .",
    "( [ f02l ] ) , requires a finite @xmath26 contribution to be rg - invariant , as one can readily see by considering the one - loop term which has an explicit @xmath33 dependence .",
    "thus , acting with the rg operator , eq .",
    "( [ rgop ] ) , on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ f02l ] ) gives a non - zero contribution of order @xmath34 : @xmath35 , which is not compensated by terms in eq .",
    "( [ rgop ] ) coming from the lowest orders in @xmath36 or @xmath37 , those being at least of next order @xmath38 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that ( perturbative ) rg invariance generally occurs from cancellations between terms coming from rg coefficients at order @xmath39 and the explicit @xmath24 dependence at the next order @xmath40 .",
    "this can also be understood alternatively by considering solely the original bare contribution to the free energy : although the latter only depends on the rg - invariant bare mass and coupling @xmath41 ( and on @xmath42 in dimensional regularization ) , its _ finite _ part is not a priori _ separately _ rg invariant . in other words for a massive theory",
    "the @xmath29-independent vacuum energy divergences can not be absorbed by an arbitrary redefinition of the vacuum energy without spoiling rg - invariance .",
    "now , as we recall below the subtraction needed to recover rg invariance is perturbatively well - defined and easy to construct order by order .",
    "the vacuum energy gets its own anomalous dimension which , within dimensional regularization , is essentially determined by the coefficients of the poles in @xmath43 , stemming from the remaining divergences once the mass and the coupling have been properly renormalized .",
    "this procedure had been exploited in an earlier application of the opt to evaluate the vacuum energy of the gross - neveu ( massive ) model @xcite and then extended to the qcd case  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a well - known related result is that the coleman - weinberg effective potential for a general massive theory is not rg invariant without _ finite _ `` vacuum energy '' terms independent of the fields , as was originally carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the @xmath11-scheme in the context of rg - improvements of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the @xmath2 @xmath17 model , the vacuum energy anomalous dimension has even been computed up to four- and five - loop order in ref .",
    "@xcite .    however , to the best of our knowledge , this point appears to have been overlooked in the context of thermal theories . in applications of improved / resummed massive perturbation schemes such as spt @xcite , htlpt @xcite , and the standard opt @xcite the calculations",
    "are mostly performed within the @xmath11-scheme and the @xmath4 vacuum energy divergence is minimally cancelled out by appropriate ( zero point ) counterterms but missing out those extra finite subtractions required by rg properties .",
    "in fact , as far as the purely perturbative massless theory is concerned , the only mass is actually a thermal mass : @xmath44 , so that the lack of rg invariance pointed out above is rather postponed to higher ( three - loop ) perturbative order @xmath45 , where it plainly resurfaces . within the spt , or the similar htlpt , approaches the variational mass parameter is similarly perturbatively of order @xmath46 .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the scale dependence observed within spt / htlpt results appears to worsen at higher orders @xcite .",
    "but more generally one wishes to use the nonperturbative mass gap resulting from such variational approaches possibly beyond standard perturbation for moderately large coupling values , as can be relevant near a critical temperature .",
    "thus , the lack of rg invariance appears more serious since as we recall in next section ( see eq .",
    "( [ subst1 ] ) , the variational procedure formally treats the mass to be of the same perturbative order as the lowest order considered contributions , like e.g. the  hard \" thermal one - loop contributions of order @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , in the standard procedure one makes the arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath24 effectively temperature dependent by choosing @xmath48 , such as to avoid large @xmath49 contributions coming from the remnant scale - dependence . in this way the pressure can be studied as a function of @xmath50 in qcd applications , where @xmath51 is related to the basic qcd @xmath52 ,",
    "e.g. _ in the @xmath11-scheme .",
    "but if the scale dependence appears not much reliable at higher loop orders , one may question as well the reliability of the corresponding @xmath50 dependence of the pressure , even for the well - motivated central @xmath53 prescription .",
    "+ while those issues in @xmath11 or related schemes may perhaps not explain at once all the problems that thermal theories face with perturbative expansions at increasing coupling , a part of those problems are likely to be reduced if one adopts from the beginning a prescription fully consistent with rg properties .",
    "this problem appears partly circumvented ( but are actually rather delayed to higher orders ) in thermal perturbative calculations performed in some other renormalization schemes , where the zero - point energy , @xmath54 , is subtracted for convenience prior to any subsequent calculations .",
    "indeed , subtracting the @xmath4 contribution from eq .",
    "( [ f02l ] ) washes out all the first @xmath24-dependent terms , making scale - independence ( trivially ) satisfied at one - loop order , and ( less trivially ) at the two loop level as well .",
    "but then the one - loop result becomes also trivial , with the only left contribution being the pure thermal , third term in the rhs of eq.([f02l ] ) .",
    "so , there are no possible optimized solutions of the opt / spt / htlpt form , which can only be obtained at the two - loop level . moreover ,",
    "applying subsequently the standard spt / opt procedure anyway spoils rg invariance . in any case",
    "it is most convenient to have a prescription generically valid both for zero and finite temperatures , so that subtracting @xmath4 contributions is not satisfactory for a more general framework .",
    "accordingly , the subtraction procedure we will consider next only depends on @xmath4 contributions but is generically valid also for @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , a remarkable consequence is that the subsequent mass optimization , as implied by rgopt , will give a nontrivial solution already at the one - loop order , and very similar to what is normally obtained at two - loop order with the other mentioned resummation schemes ( spt / opt , htlpt , 2pi , ... ) , as we will examine in detail . + following refs .",
    "@xcite the easiest way to construct an rg - invariant finite vacuum energy is to determine @xmath26 order by order as a perturbative series from the reminder of acting with eq .",

    "this procedure leaves non rg - invariant remnant terms of perturbative higher orders to be cared for similarly once higher order terms are considered .",
    "the apparently odd divergent behavior for @xmath60 of this first order term is actually not a problem since , as we will see explicitly , it completely disappears from the final results .",
    "+ we stress that all the previous considerations , being only dependent on the renormalization procedure , do not depend on the thermal contribution so that , at arbitrary perturbative orders , the subtraction function represented by eq.([subgen ] ) can be determined simply from the @xmath4 contributions only   and the @xmath55 contributions are not explicitly separated , like in the case of two- and three - loop htlpt @xcite , due to the systematic @xmath61 expansion making such involved calculations tractable , caution will be needed to expand at a sufficient order in @xmath61 so as to get all the relevant terms of the same perturbative order to construct the corresponding subtractions in eq .",

    "now , there is a subtlety at this stage : while the @xmath57 subtraction terms are strictly necessary to recover rg invariance at order @xmath39 , i.e. up to neglected @xmath40 terms , they enter the free energy expression at order @xmath68 as eq .",

    "for instance , solving similarly the opt and rg equations for @xmath403 ( respectively @xmath404 ) gives @xmath405 ( respectively @xmath406 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the previously examined remnant scale dependence of the rg and opt pressures at such relatively large coupling values . +",
    "as above mentioned one may expect that the full rgopt solution for arbitrary scale input could give a sensible approximation of the genuine nonperturbative scale dependence of the coupling .",
    "what eq .",
    "( [ fullrgopt ] ) indicates is that , for the physically reasonable scale choice @xmath10 , the optimized coupling @xmath389 and mass @xmath354 are both of order @xmath353 , lying in the rather nonperturbative range where the soft modes @xmath407 become comparable with the hard modes @xmath408 . had we rather found optimized values @xmath409 , we would not learn much beyond standard perturbation theory .",
    "however , we can not easily follow the combined solution over an arbitrarily large range of scale : the physical branch solution remains real for relatively large variations of @xmath410 , but becomes complex for @xmath411 $ \\sim$}}~}0.27 $ ] , which corresponds to the already mentioned complex rg solution for the large coupling @xmath412 .",
    "thus as already stressed we should not trust our results for @xmath274 above @xmath278 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] , which corresponds to @xmath411 $ \\sim$}}~}.5 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath410 ( respectively @xmath413 ) within a reasonable range , the combined rgopt solution gives slightly smaller ( respectively larger ) optimized @xmath389 values as compared with the one in ( [ fullrgopt ] ) , unlike the standard perturbative rg behavior of the @xmath17 model at small coupling .",
    "indeed for even larger @xmath312 , where one expects to recover the four - dimensional @xmath4 @xmath17 model properties , the rgopt real solution gives a slowly ( logarithmically ) decreasing coupling and mass , which appears roughly consistent naively with the expected triviality property@xcite .",
    "conversely , for @xmath311 one expects to recover the three - dimensional high-@xmath29 limit , such that after eventually reaching a maximum , the optimized coupling is expected to decrease again for @xmath311 .",
    "but it is difficult to follow the full rgopt solution becoming complex for @xmath311 .",
    "nevertheless , even if they have no real intersections , the opt and rg solutions can be reliably determined for @xmath311 , as discussed in sec .",
    "vii.b , and for fixed @xmath414 , @xmath415 or @xmath416 decrease logarithmically for @xmath311 . + note that when incorporating the @xmath230 term from eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) , the full rgopt solutions similar to ( [ fullrgopt ] ) are shifted to a different scale but with the same qualitative behavior , so the net effect of @xmath230 appears essentially as a renormalization scheme redefinition , without drastically changing the results .",
    "incidentally , for @xmath230 the full rgopt solution is already complex for @xmath388 , while real solutions appear for slightly larger @xmath417 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] values , with corresponding optimal @xmath90 values very close to the one in ( [ fullrgopt ] ) .",
    "this simply reflects that the occurrence of complex rgopt solutions in a given theory depend much on the renormalization scheme , so that real solutions could be recovered in principle from appropriate perturbative scheme changes  @xcite .",
    "but this is a much more involved task in the present finite temperature case . moreover , since the non - trivial rg and opt intersecting solution happens first at two - loop order , it is probably safer not to take as a very firm prediction the result in ( [ fullrgopt ] ) , nor to vary in a wide range around the preferred value @xmath10 . from the example of @xmath4 results in other models",
    "@xcite the rgopt variational fixed point solution is more likely to stabilize at the three - loop order , and probably with a more perturbative value of the optimized coupling .",
    "let us summarize our main results .",
    "we have shown that the standard treatment of the free energy ( pressure ) in massive thermal theories , with minimally subtracted counterterms , as primarily done in resummation approaches like opt / spt , htlpt typically , lacks rg invariance .",
    "we have then recalled a general simple recipe to restore rg invariance , leading unavoidably to additional finite , temperature - independent vacuum energy contributions , systematically derivable in a perturbative fashion . we have next explained that the opt / spt , htlpt resummation methods based on the modification of the perturbative expansion from the linear @xmath101-expansion in general do not preserve rg invariance , which can however be restored for a different interpolating prescription , eq .",
    "( [ subst1 ] ) , uniquely dictated by universal first order rg coefficients , @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , the resulting rgopt resummation can use the rg equation as an alternative or additional combined constraint to determine a self - consistent nonperturbative mass ( and coupling ) , in addition to the sole standard opt prescription using only the mass optimization .",
    "we have then illustrated the rgopt in details by evaluating the free energy of a thermal scalar field theory at one- and two - loop level .",
    "the results show a substantial improvement regarding this type of nonperturbative approach .",
    "namely , we obtain exact rg / scale invariance at the first non trivial one - loop rgopt order , which also reproduces all the exact large-@xmath1 results  @xcite of the @xmath2 scalar model . at two - loop rgopt order",
    ", the scale dependence and stability are drastically improved up to relatively large coupling values , with respect to most of the other available resummation approaches .",
    "not surprisingly the pressure obtained from the rg mass gap equation happens to have better convergence and scale dependence properties for large coupling than the pressure obtained from the opt mass gap .",
    "we have also illustrated the full rgopt result obtained from combining the rg and opt equations , therefore completely fixing the coupling and mass for a given input scale , with results that can be considered as a variational approximation to the truly scale invariant nonperturbative all order result . beyond two - loop order , since all relevant perturbative results are available at three - loop order  @xcite , the rgopt procedure can be applied , but we leave this for future work as it becomes algebraically and numerically somewhat more involved . besides , we are confident that it will further improve the scale dependence with respect to the two - loop results , without explicit three - loop calculations : as explained the rgopt construction will guarantee the rgopt free energy to be perturbatively rg invariant up to neglected four - loop @xmath418 terms , for _ arbitrary _ mass @xmath18 .",
    "this implies , after using the ( opt or rg ) gap equation , that perturbatively a remnant scale dependence appears in the free energy at order @xmath419 .",
    "the same line of reasoning also explains why the lack of rg invariance of opt / spt at formally one - loop order @xmath420 for arbitrary @xmath18 , remains partly hidden at one- and two - loop but resurfaces maximally at perturbative three - loop order @xmath45 .",
    "we also see that the rgopt anticipates the predictions by one perturbative order , the exact one - loop results being qualitatively similar to standard two - loop resummation results .",
    "therefore , one may argue similarly that the two - loop rgopt results should be qualitatively comparable to ( standard ) spt three - loop results   from ( [ sub ] ) , ( [ s0s1 ] ) is included , it is related from rg properties to the single logarithm coefficient of this three - loop basketball graph . ] ( with a sensibly better scale invariance ) . indeed , incorporating the @xmath64 subtraction term at two - loop order , which includes a ( rg ) part of the three - loop contributions ,",
    "further improves the convergence and scale dependence in the nonperturbative coupling range . for these reasons considering the full three - loop contributions",
    "is certainly a welcome refinement but not necessary a crucial one in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the method which constitutes our main goal here .",
    "+ it should be also clear that the whole construction illustrated in particular in secs .",
    "3 to 5 is actually more general , and that it is applicable to qcd .",
    "we have already mentioned some properties anticipated to be similar , or sometimes different , in the qcd case .",
    "one could expect that the thermal qcd application may be a priori much more difficult than the traditionally simpler scalar model .",
    "but given that the difficult gauge dependence and related qcd issues have been solved by the htl formalism  @xcite , the elaborate perturbative htlpt calculations performed for thermal qcd up to three - loop order in @xcite should be readily adaptable to our rgopt method , which in a first stage relies entirely on perturbative calculations . in htlpt only vacuum energy , mass , and coupling counterterms are necessary to renormalize the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the quark mass anomalous dimension is just the standard one , while the gluon mass anomalous dimension is easily extracted from corresponding known counterterms , given e.g. in @xcite .",
    "thus our subtraction procedure to recover rg invariance will work just like in the scalar model , applying rg with eq .",
    "( [ rgop ] ) , ( [ gamma ] ) , and the modifed interpolation eq .",
    "( [ subst1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the htlpt formalism is inherently a high-@xmath29 expansion , therefore it will give opt and rg equations in @xmath61 and @xmath274 , simpler than the somewhat involved two - loop exact @xmath29-dependent mass gap eqs .",
    "( [ opt2l ] ) , ( [ rg2l ] ) ( except that for qcd , htlpt at two - loop order involves @xmath421 terms , due to the two - loop qcd free energy graph structure ) .",
    "finally , for qcd the known first four coefficients of the @xmath15-function , @xmath422 , all have the same ( negative ) sign , such that no fake perturbative fixed points , such as the one present here in the scalar model , will obstruct the identification of correct rgopt solutions .",
    "we are confident that a similarly improved scale - dependence and overall stability will be obtained also from rgopt adaptation of htlpt , which could potentially put confrontation with thermal qcd lattice results on even firmer grounds .",
    "is partially supported by conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq - brazil ) .",
    "for completeness is this appendix we derive the subtraction terms in eq .",
    "( [ s0s1 ] ) alternatively by rg invariance considerations solely on the bare expression .",
    "the bare free energy at two - loop level consists of eq.([f02l ] ) plus the remnant divergent terms  @xcite ( after mass and coupling renormalization at this order ) with @xmath21 : ( 4)^2 e_0 ( ) = -m^4 .",
    "[ e0div ] as amply explained , minimally subtracting eq.([e0div ] ) would not produce a finite rg - invariant expression . instead",
