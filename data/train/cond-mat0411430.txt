    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire has been of great theoretical and experimental interests in the past .",
    "this is because of not only the wide variety of fascinating phenomena it exhibits , but also the testing grounds it offers for ideas that may become applicable in higher dimensions . in practice ,",
    "1d wires needs not be physically one dimension .",
    "it may result from projection after a partial fourier transformation from higher dimensional models .",
    "for instance , a superlattice structure can be reduced to an equivalent 1d structure after a partial fourier transformation along the direction normal to the layers .",
    "similar examples include @xmath0-wave superconductors , graphite sheet , and many other systems .",
    "therefore , understanding the 1d wire is an ideal first step toward the understanding of any higher dimensional problems .",
    "further boost for studying 1d wires comes from recent advances achieved in nanotechnology . here",
    "the feasibility for bottom - up assembly of single nanowires@xcite has made direct investigation of finite 1d wires possible .",
    "nevertheless , conventional studies of the 1d wire have mostly been focused on its bulk properties , whereas assembled nanowires can only have finite lengths and must terminate at some sites ( the ends , or the edges ) .",
    "it is therefore desirable to reconsider the effects of the ends to the properties of the nanowires .    the commonly recognized edge ( or surface )",
    "effects in the physics of nanostructures are concerned with the large volume fraction of the boundaries . however , from either fundamental or practical viewpoints , the possible occurrence of edge modes and its influences on the properties of the system poses a much more interesting problem .",
    "for example , when applying carbon nanotubes as emitters for screen displays , the occurrence of edge states may change the density of electrons at the edge and thus affects the threshold working potential .",
    "it is therefore of great technological interest if one could devise a way to engineer the number of edge states . from the fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "the elegant role of edge excitations in the physics of quantum hall systems@xcite is a well known example that illustrates the importance of edge states . generally speaking",
    ", the edge states occur within the gap of the bulk energy spectrum and are called the midgap states .",
    "the existence of these states causes anomalous properties near the end which can manifest in tunneling measurements .",
    "a recently discovered example is the zero - bias conductance peak observed in the @xmath1 measurement of the metal-@xmath0-wave superconductor junctions@xcite .",
    "when electron - electron interactions are present , as occurs for an externally - implemented magnetic impurity , `` intrinsic '' kondo effects may also arise due to these localized states , causing zero - bias anomaly near the fermi energies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the system is finite , coupling between edge states can not be neglected .",
    "an example is the anomalous paramagnetic behavior observed in carbon nanoribbons@xcite , where we have recently shown that there are residual antiferromagnetic couplings between edge spins in this system@xcite .",
    "all these examples clearly illustrate the important role of edge states in the physics and applications of nanostructures .    in previous work , applying the green s function approach",
    ", we have shown that broken reflection symmetry is a necessary condition for the occurrence of edge states , and the energies of edge states are the roots to the green s function @xcite . in this work ,",
    "resorting to the supersymmetric method , we further develop a systematic way to determine the wavefunctions and the precise energies of the edge states .",
    "conventionally , the usage of the supersymmetric method in the condensed matter physics has been focused on applying the supersymmetry ( susy ) quantum field theory to disorder systems@xcite .",
    "the application of the corresponding ( 0 + 1 ) dimensional limit -the susy quantum mechanics@xcite , however , is quite limited .",
    "nevertheless , it has been realized@xcite that the zero - bias anomaly in @xmath0-wave superconductors is closely related with the susy quantum mechanics .",
    "these studies , however , are done in in the continuum limit , using the semi - classical approximation , while the more relevant limit for high tc superconductors and many other systems is the tight binding limit .",
    "furthermore , the zero - energy state was the primary focus , while not all the states localized at the edge have zero energy .",
    "it is therefore important to see if the idea of susy quantum mechanics can be generalized to understand the finite - energy midgap states , in particular those in the discrete condensed matter systems , as well . in this work",
    ", we shall show that indeed , this is possible .",
    "we shall first show that the semi - infinite tight - binding @xmath0-wave superconductors belongs to a more general class , the bipartite system , and which can be well described by the conventional susy quantum mechanics@xcite . here",
    "the supersymmetric partners are two sublattices of the same system and the susy is characterized by a hermitian supercharge @xmath2 and the susy hamiltonian @xmath3 with @xmath4=0 $ ] . for bipartite systems with nearest neighbor hoppings , @xmath2 is identical to the physical hamiltonian ( @xmath5 ) and hence @xmath6 is a quadratic functional of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the zero - energy state is annihilated by the supercharge , which then constitutes one of the conditions for determining the zero - energy state ; while the other condition is to require it to decay from the edge .",
    "it is found that this conventional susy quantum mechanics can be appropriately extended to describe the semi - infinite @xmath8-partite systems with nearest neighbor hoppings . first , when @xmath9 , the original supercharge splits into two : in addition to the physical hamiltonian @xmath10 , a second supercharge @xmath11 can be formed .",
    "they both commute with the susy hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , only when @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a quadratic functional of @xmath10 . in general",
    ", @xmath12 is a polynomial functional of @xmath10 .",
    "this is a reminisce of the fractional susy quantum mechanics@xcite in which the susy hamiltonian is generalized to be integer power of the supercharge .",
    "nevertheless , our model is different and provides more realistic generalization of the conventional susy .",
    "the upshot of this generalization shows that , in addition to the zero - energy state , all the midgap states , including finite energy ones , are annihilated by the supercharge @xmath11 .",
    "the wavefunctions of the midgap states thus obtained tend to vanish with the same period commensurate with @xmath8 : @xmath15 .",
    "these zeroes cut the original hamiltonian into smaller ones so that the energies of the midgap states are determined by the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian within each period . as a result ,",
    "the matrix for determining the energies of midgap states is of size much smaller than the size of the original hamiltonian .",
    "this reduction in matrix size heavily reduces the computation for determining the occurrence of the midgap states and provides a way to control the occurrence of the midgap states . as an application",
    ", we propose a structure with superlattice in hopping with period @xmath8 to control the number of localized electronic states occurring at the end of nanowires . in that case , the number of edge states is simply @xmath16 .    as the period @xmath8 goes to infinity , the ensemble of configurations of hopping forms a semi - infinite disorder chain .",
    "this limit has been extensively investigated during the past@xcite since dyson s seminal work@xcite in which it was pointed out that the average density of state ( dos ) is enhanced at zero energy . from our point of view",
    ", this enhancement also reflects that the system has high probabilities to take the above - mentioned form for the ground state .",
    "the presence of the boundary breaks translational invariance .",
    "thus , unlike the bulk case where the dos at zero energy has no spatial dependence , the enhance dos at zero energy for semi - infinite disordered wires has the largest amplitude near the edge . even for slight disorders ,",
    "the effects of enhanced dos at zero - energy are still observable .",
    "this offers a possible explanation for many unexpected zero - bias anomalies observed in tunneling experiments because , unless extremely carefully controlled , junction qualities are usually rather poor and disorders can easily set in near the junctions@xcite .",
    "other implications and extensions of our generalized susy quantum mechanics will also be discussed . in particular , we shall demonstrate that by appropriate mappings , the ordinarily recognized impurity state can be viewed as a disguised midgap state .",
    "such mapping provides a simple way to construct the impurity wavefunction and the corresponding energy .",
    "in addition to this application , possible extension to include the electron - electron interactions will also be discussed at the end of this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[theory ] , we lay down the basic tight binding model considered in this work and illustrate the susy quantum mechanics for the bipartite systems . in sec.[general ] , we generalize the supercharge and supersymmetric hamiltonian to the @xmath8-partite systems and discuss the disorder limit .",
    "we also point it out of how to engineer the number of edge states by using a superlattice structure . by applying the susy quantum mechanics ,",
    "we illustrate in sec.[impurity ] how an impurity state can be viewed as a midgap state . in sec.[conclude ] , we conclude and discuss possible generalization to include electron - electron interactions . appendices",
    "a and b are devoted to technical details of superalgebra and computation of commutators .",
    "we start by considering the 1d atomic chain as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ chain](a ) .",
    "this is the most general 1d atomic chain in which reflection symmetry with respect to the edge point is broken and , consequently , edge states might arise@xcite . in the tight - binding limit ,",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian to model this system : @xmath17 here the subscript @xmath8 indicates the period of the lattice and @xmath18 is the site index ; @xmath19 is the hopping amplitude between site @xmath18 and its nearest neighbors , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the electron annihilation ( creation ) operator , and @xmath22 is the local potential at site @xmath18 .",
    "we shall assume that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are periodic with period @xmath8 , namely @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in real systems , this hamiltonian may correspond to an assembly of @xmath8 different atoms repeatedly arranged into a line ( see fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) . for wires composed of atoms of a single species",
    ", @xmath10 may describe systems which exhibit density - wave order .",
    "this includes polyacetylene@xcite , which has a dimerized structure and corresponds to @xmath13 , and polymers with higher commensurability charge density waves@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we shall call @xmath13 the @xmath27-@xmath28 model , and similarly for models with higher periods . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", @xmath29 may also represent the reduced model of a higher dimensional structure after partial fourier transformation .",
    "for example , for a semi - infinite graphite sheet with zig - zag edge , since the system is translationally invariant along the edge , a partial fourier transformation can be applied along this direction , leading to an effective 1d model . in this case",
    ", it is identical to the @xmath27-@xmath28 model except that now @xmath30 and @xmath28 are @xmath31-dependent@xcite : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the lattice constant and @xmath34 represents the fourier mode .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to understand the anomalous properties near the edge in carbon ribbons@xcite . as a final example , we note that the operator @xmath35 in @xmath29 needs not be restricted to be the electron annihilation operator .",
    "for example , after applying the jordan - wigner transformation , one can map a 1d quantum xy spin chain to a 1d model described by @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath23 replaced by the exchange coupling for nearest neighbors @xmath36 , and @xmath37 replaced by the local magnetic field @xmath38 .",
    "it is clear from these examples that @xmath29  is quite general and captures the physics of many interesting systems .    to investigate the behavior of @xmath29 near the edge , as a first step , we calculate the local density of states at the end point using the generalized method of image developed in ref .  3 .",
    "[ ldos ] shows typical local density of states at the end point for small periods .",
    "the parameters are carefully chosen so that all possible midgap states are present .",
    "in particular , we have set @xmath39 , which amounts to choosing the energy zero as the origin .",
    "these results show that midgap states are indeed the most prominent features at the end point . to understand how the midgap states arise , we first investigate the @xmath27-@xmath28 model with @xmath39 in details . in this case , since the lattice is bipartite , it is convenient to distinguish the amplitudes at the odd and the even sites by writing the wavefunction as @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the null matrix and @xmath44 is a non - hermitian matrix @xmath45 it is interesting to note that the adjoint of @xmath44 satisfies @xmath46 here the operator @xmath47 effectively reflects the wavefunction with respect to the mid point of the lattice .    in the case of infinite chains ,",
    "it is not hard to check that the corresponding matrices @xmath44 and @xmath48 commute with each other and hence can be diagonalized simultaneously in fourier space . for semi - infinite chains , however , @xmath44 and @xmath48 do not commute and the spectrum of the @xmath27-@xmath28 model can be best understood in terms of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics@xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we first identify @xmath49 as the _ supercharge _",
    "@xmath50 , which connects even and odd sites .",
    "the block - diagonal matrix @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is then identified as ( up to a factor of two ) the corresponding supersymmetric hamiltonian , whose diagonal blocks @xmath53 and @xmath54 are , respectively , the effective hamiltonians for the odd and the even sites . note that because @xmath44 and @xmath48 do not commute , @xmath55 .",
    "we will show below that the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the origin of the midgap states .",
    "obviously , @xmath6 is positive definite with the possibility when its spectrum touches zero .",
    "when the later happens , the ground state energy of @xmath6 vanishes , the ground state wavefunctions @xmath58 and @xmath59 [ @xmath60 , @xmath41 ] have to be the zero - energy eigenfunction of @xmath44 and @xmath61 , _ ie . _  @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , the supercharge annihilates the ground state wavefunction @xmath64 @xmath65 clearly , in this case , the system has good supersymmetry because the ground state is invariant under  rotation \" between even and odd sites : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is any real number .",
    "the non - hermiticity of @xmath44 and @xmath48 implies that forward and backward hopping amplitudes between two sites are different , and hence the eigenfunctions have to either grow or decay from the end point . obviously , because of the relation @xmath68 , any non - trivial eigenfunctions satisfy @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath70 decays from the edge , @xmath71 must grow from the edge ( vice versa ) . for semi - infinite chains ,",
    "only the even sites are connected with the hard - wall boundary point .",
    "thus @xmath71 is forced to vanish while @xmath70 decays into the bulk , so that @xmath72 .",
    "note that the other possible state @xmath73 resides on the other end of the chain and is pushed to infinity .",
    "therefore , overall speaking , there is only half a chance for the existence of the ground state @xmath74 .",
    "this also reflects in the hopping strength difference .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath70 decays only when @xmath75 . in this case , @xmath56 has a non - trivial zero energy eigenfunction , while @xmath57 does not .",
    "therefore , the system has good supersymmetry with _ the ground state _ @xmath76 _",
    "being a localized state .",
    "_ for finite energies , however , @xmath58 and @xmath77 need not be eigenfunctions of @xmath78 and @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , the supersymmetry allows a simple and elegant way to find the whole spectrum for the case @xmath13 .",
    "this is because @xmath57 has the exact form as @xmath79 ( @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "since this is just the ordinary uniform hopping model , one can easily write down the eigenstate : @xmath83 . the wavefunction at odd site can be then found by using the supercharge operator .",
    "we find that @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the spectrum of @xmath49 which satisfies @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 , an energy gap opens up around @xmath88 when @xmath89 . in the case of @xmath75 , the ground state",
    "@xmath90 then arises as a midgap state .",
    "note that @xmath56 is almost identical to @xmath57 except for the potential energy @xmath91 at the end point ; the deficit energy @xmath92 is entirely due to the missing bond cut off by the boundary .",
    "we will elaborate on this in sec.[impurity ] .",
    "we now address the effects of the potential @xmath22 . for @xmath13 , it is convenient to denote the potentials over the even sites @xmath93 and the odd sites @xmath94 . this decomposition , however , renders the particle - hole symmetry invalid at the level of the supercharge @xmath49 .",
    "nonetheless , the spectrum ( @xmath85 ) of @xmath49 can be mapped to the original spectrum of @xmath6 with @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . for @xmath97",
    "this mapping is given by @xmath98 , while for @xmath99 , since @xmath100 still holds , one has @xmath101 .",
    "hence even though the physical spectrum @xmath85 may have no particle - hole symmetry , after appropriate transformations , the symmetric structure can be restored in @xmath102 ; in particular , the midgap state survives as clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ph ] . for higher periods ,",
    "the same manipulations as above can lead to similar conclusions . therefore ,",
    "unless explicitly needed , we shall ignore @xmath37 in the following .",
    "let us now apply the supersymmetric method to semi - infinite superconductors@xcite .",
    "after partial fourier transformation along the interface , the problem becomes 1d superconductors with an end point . in this case , it is convenient to write the wavefunction by @xmath103 with @xmath104 being particle - like and @xmath105 being hole - like wavefunctions . the reduced mean - field ( bcs )",
    "hamiltonian is dirac - like@xcite and can be generally written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 corresponds to the reduced 1d hamiltonian for particles and @xmath108 is essentially the pairing potential .",

    "the transformation matrix@xcite is @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are semi - infinite matrices .",
    "the rotated hamiltonian then takes the form of a supercharge like @xmath49 @xmath118 the wavefunction is rotated accordingly : @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , in the supersymmetric form , particles and holes are mixed . as an illustration",
    ", we consider the mean - field hamiltonian for @xmath0-wave superconductors @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the nearest - neighbor bonds , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are , respectively , the corresponding hopping and @xmath0-wave pairing amplitudes .",
    "for the @xmath124 interface , after fourier transformation along the interface ( which is taken to be the @xmath125 direction ) , we obtain@xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the chemical potential , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath135 and @xmath136 have the same eigenvalue @xmath85 .",
    "this implies that the calculation of the zero mode is related to the spectrum of @xmath140 .",
    "if we restrict our discussion to the propagating modes , the spectrum of @xmath140 is simply the ordinary cosine band .",

    "note that for demonstration , we have only considered the case when @xmath149 is real .",
    "complete solutions , however , require to include the situation when @xmath149 is complex@xcite .",
    "in both cases , the supersymmetry structure enables one to write down the explicit form of the zero - energy mode near the interface @xmath124 .",
    "we now generalize the above results to higher periods @xmath150 .",
    "it is useful to decompose the wavefunction as @xmath151 , @xmath152,@xmath153,@xmath154 , where @xmath155 denotes the sub - wavefunction formed by @xmath156 .",

    "@xmath10 is obviously a solution because @xmath192 . however , in analogy to the case of @xmath13 , a second supercharge by collecting all block matrices in @xmath10 that connects @xmath193 to other components can be formed : @xmath194 note that the above defintion can also include @xmath13 . in that case , one squeezes the block @xmath195 into @xmath196 to obtain the form of @xmath7 in eq.([h2 ] ) .",

    "it is clear that @xmath236 is precisely the square of @xmath237 , and thus @xmath238 are the midgap states resulting from the supersymmetry within the even sublattice .",
    "the remaining midgap state at @xmath239 originates from the same supersymmetric structure as that for @xmath13 between even and odd sites .",
    "hence @xmath240 vanishes for @xmath241 .",
    "obviously , the same effects may occur for any @xmath8 that is not a prime number .    as an application",
    ", we point out that a simple way to engineer localized edge states in a nanowire ( such as carbon nanotubes ) is to introduce impurity - bonds periodically and form a semi - infinite superlattice structure . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath242 while @xmath243 .",
    "it is known that in the infinite case , there are @xmath8 energy bands . however , when it becomes semi - infinite , @xmath16 localized edge states may arise simultaneously and they are located exactly in the @xmath16 gaps among these energy bands .",
    "the proposed superlattice structure thus provides a convenient way to control the number of edge states .",
    "the above result can be quite easily derived in our formulation .",
    "first of all , eq.([mid ] ) implies that the energies of edge modes are exactly the energies of a finite atomic chain with uniform hopping @xmath244 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath245 with @xmath246 , @xmath247 .",
    "note that these @xmath31 s occur exactly at the zone boundaries of the energy bands , hence they appear within the energy gaps .",
    "eq.([phip ] ) further implies that for any edge mode , their wavefunction satisfies @xmath248 .",
    "since @xmath249 and @xmath250 have the same amplitude , we get @xmath251 . therefore , as long as @xmath252 , all midgap wavefunctions decay and hence the @xmath16 midgap states appear at the same time .",
    "another example is to consider the limit when @xmath8 goes to infinity . since for any given configuration of @xmath253 , @xmath19 ( @xmath254 )",
    "is allowed to be any number ; effectively , the wire is a disordered semi - infinite wires .",
    "it is well known that the density of states at zero - energy become enhanced@xcite in the disordered wires . in the following ,",
    "we will find that such enhancement can be also understood from the above point of view .",
    "essentially , this is because for any given @xmath19 configuration , the system has high probability to settle into the form of the ground state wavefunction discussed above .",
    "first , because the boundary breaks the translational invariance , if one decomposes the wavefunction as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , it is still true that only the even sites are connected to the hard - wall boundary point . in this case , for any set of @xmath255 , the non - hermitian matrix @xmath44 that enters eq.([h2 ] ) is given by @xmath256 for the zero - energy state , because @xmath257 , it is easy to see that @xmath100 ; while the wavefunction at odd sites is determined by @xmath258 .",
    "if we set @xmath259 , the wavefunction at site @xmath260 is given by @xmath261 .",
    "let @xmath262 , then @xmath263 . clearly , because @xmath264 , the logarithm of the wavefunction at odd sites behaves effectively as a random walker .",
    "since a random walker has large probability to go to @xmath265 , @xmath76 has high probability of decaying to zero far from the edge and becomes a localized zero - energy mode .",
    "this analogy leads to @xmath266 with @xmath267 being the standard deviation of @xmath268 .",
    "in other words , @xmath269 where @xmath270 correspond to states localized at either ends , respectively . we emphasize that this analysis indicates that _ only the standard deviation of @xmath268 is relevant _ and there is no need for the assumption of gaussian - type randomness , which is often invoked in previous works .",
    "furthermore , the random - walk nature makes the zero - energy peak much more easily formed .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ disordered ] where we show that even slight disorders near the edge may induce features resembling zero - bias peaks in tunneling measurements . in this case",
    ", the zero - energy state tends to decay from the edge but will not become localized . instead , after joining the non - disorder bulk region , it becomes a resonant state@xcite .",
    "such phenomena may have already been seen in experiments@xcite .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that in the supersymmetric approach the ordinarily recognized impurity states can be viewed as disguised midgap states .",
    "let us consider the goodwin model for the surface state@xcite . in this model",
    ", it was proposed that the surface state arises because the potential suddenly changes near the surface or the edge . in the tight binding limit",
    ", the hamiltonian is given by@xcite @xmath271 in other words , there is an impurity potential localized at the first site .",
    "it is commonly recognized that under appropriate condition , an impurity state ( in this case , it is the goodwin edge state . ) may arise and exhibit as an isolated line in the spectrum as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ impurity](b ) .",
    "clearly , we see from fig .",
    "[ impurity ] , the spectrum with an impurity state is essentially the square of spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ impurity](a ) , i.e. , the spectrum with a midgap state .    to establish the relation described above , we go back to previous analysis on the @xmath27-@xmath28 model . as is obvious , the spectrum of @xmath272 ( @xmath273 ) is the square of that for @xmath49 , fulfilling the relation indicated in fig .",
    "[ impurity ] .",
    "it is hence useful and more transparent if we explicitly write down @xmath272 @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the effective hamiltonian for the odd sites and @xmath276 is the effective hamiltonian for the even sites .",
    "one sees that @xmath56 and @xmath57 differ by the potential at site @xmath277 . as mentioned , this is entirely due to the missing bond cut off by the boundary . on the other hand , even though @xmath272 is block - diagonal , it does not imply even and odd sites are independently from each other .",
    "in fact , they are connected by the supercharge @xmath49 .",
    "the point is that except for the zero energy which is an eigenvalue of @xmath56 , @xmath56 and @xmath278 share the same energy eigenvalue @xmath279 with @xmath85 being the spectrum of @xmath49 .",
    "the supersymmetric relation between even and odd sites enables one to solve the goodwin model @xmath280 as follows .",
    "one first rewrites @xmath281 -t_{2}^{2}c_{1}^{\\dagger } c_{1}.\\ ] ] clearly , it shows that the effective hamiltonian for the odd sites ie equivalent to the goodwin model with @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
    "the wavefunction of the midgap state on odd sites then become the wavefunction of the impurity state in the goodwin model . furthermore",
    ", the energy of the impurity state can be easily found to be @xmath285 . by solving @xmath27 and @xmath28 in terms of @xmath244 and @xmath286",
    ", we find @xmath287 . since the midgap states exist when @xmath288 , the impurity state appears only when @xmath289 , in consistent with the standard approach@xcite .",
    "the discussion above concerns with the case @xmath290 , hence the impurity energy resides on the left side ( the solid line ) in fig .",
    "[ impurity](b ) . for @xmath291 ,",
    "the goodwin model maps to @xmath292 .",
    "one obtains the same expression for the impurity energy @xmath287 except that it resides on the right side ( the dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ impurity](b ) .",
    "in addition to the energy of the impurity states , the above analysis also implies that the entire spectrum is simply @xmath293 .",
    "furthermore , the supersymmetric relation between even and odd sites enables one to write down all wavefunctions for the goodwin model explicitly .",
    "this is entirely due to the fact that the hamiltonian of the supersymmetric partner to the goodwin model is @xmath57 which is a uniform hopping model .",
    "we obtain the wavefunction for the impurity state @xmath294 , while for the extended states , when @xmath290 , @xmath295 , and when @xmath291 , @xmath296/e_{k}$ ] with @xmath297 .",
    "one can also apply the same approach to the bulk case . in fig .",
    "[ sshsol](a ) , we show that the soliton configuration in polyacetylene discussed by su , schrieffer , and heeger ( the ssh soliton)@xcite is essentially a bulk impurity illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sshsol](b ) .",
    "the same analysis leads to the results : for @xmath290 , @xmath298 and @xmath299^{|n|}$ ] , while for @xmath291 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301^{|n|}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath169 is measured from the impurity site .",
    "note that unlike the case for semi - infinite chains , the impurity state for the bulk 1d chain exists for any @xmath286 and @xmath244 .",
    "the purpose of the above analysis is only for demonstration . in principle , it can be also applied to cases when the potential extends from the first to other lattice points in the goodwin model . for instance , one can include an additional term @xmath302 in the goodwin model . in that case , the first and second bonds in the corresponding @xmath27-@xmath28 model has to be different and denoted as @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "one then obtains that @xmath305 , @xmath306 , and @xmath307 . since for any changes of finite number of hoppings",
    ", the energy of the edge mode stays at zero .",
    "the energy of the impurity state is still given by @xmath308 .",
    "solving @xmath309 and @xmath310 in terms of @xmath244 , @xmath286 , and @xmath311 yields the energy of the impurity state .",
    "we close this section by pointing out that the idea of mapping impurity states to midgap states is quite general .",
    "in addition to the simplest version of the goodwin model discussed so far , it also works for more general cases .",
    "for instance , consider the generalized goodwin model @xmath312 in which one introduces an impurity potential at the 1st site of the @xmath27-@xmath28 model .",
    "this model can be mapped to the effective hamiltonian for the odd sites of a @xmath313-@xmath314-@xmath315-@xmath316 model , i.e. , the @xmath226 ( @xmath317 ) model .",
    "specifically , one finds that @xmath312 is equivalent to the block in @xmath318 that describes the odd sites ; while its supersymmetric partner is the original @xmath27-@xmath28 model with no impurity potential .",
    "the impurity state of @xmath312 is identified as the midgap state of the @xmath317 model at @xmath88 .",
    "simple calculation then yields @xmath319 .",
    "thus , one concludes that in general the impurity state of @xmath10 can be mapped to the midgap state of @xmath320 .",
    "in summary , in this work we have shown that the properties of midgap states in semi - infinite 1d nanowires are dictated by a underlying discrete supersymmetry .",
    "this supersymmetric structure generalizes the ordinary supersymmetric quantum mechanics and offers a new point of view toward the origin of edge states . in the presence of hard - wall boundary condition ( @xmath321 ) ,",
    "the sublattice which directly connects to the hard - wall spans the null space of the supersymmetric ground state . as a consequence , the energies of the midgap states are determined by the eigenvalues of a reduced hamiltonian , eq.([mid ] ) , whose size is much smaller than that of the original hamiltonian .",
    "this reduction in matrix size significantly reduces the computation cost for determining the occurrence of the midgap states and offers a way to manipulate them . as an application , we investigate a structure with superlattice in hopping . in this case , the number of edge states is simply the period of the superlattice minus one .",
    "therefore , changing the period offers a way to control the number of localized electronic states at the edge of the nanowires .",
    "while so far in this work we have not considered electron - electron interactions , from adiabatic continuity , the results obtained here should still hold for cases when the electron - electron interactions are weak ( so that quasi - particles are well defined ) . moreover , if the ",
    "1d chain \" results from the reduction of a higher dimensional structure where interactions are not important , then it is legitimate to ignore interactions in its effective 1d model .",
    "this is of course not correct in truly 1d atomic chains where it is known that interactions may dominate the physics and the quasi - particle pictures may fail . in this case , however , the states we obtain can be used as the basis to express the full hamiltonian ( with interactions ) utilizing the relation @xmath322 . when coulomb interaction is included , it reduces to the anderson model@xcite in which the edge state acts as an impurity state .",
    "the scattering of extended states by the edge states essentially causes the kondo effect , resulting in the zero - bias peaks near the fermi energies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction also correct the localized edge state .",
    "this is conventionally analyzed in the fano - anderson model@xcite , in which it is known that as long as the new energy found remains inside the gap , the corresponding state is a localized state . in either of the above",
    "mentioned effects , our results will serve as useful inputs for attaining the final corrections .",
