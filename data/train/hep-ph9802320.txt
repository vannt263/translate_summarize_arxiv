    "when we discuss whether there should be muon colliders in our future , we must answer a number of important questions .",
    "what machines are possible ? when ?",
    "at what cost ?    what are the physics opportunities ?",
    "can we do physics in the environment ?",
    "( what does it take ? )    how will these experiments add to existing knowledge _ when they are done ? _ the aim of this talk is to provide a survey of what we might expect to know about the top quark and the higgs boson before a @xmath6 collider operates @xcite .",
    "let us take a moment to recall the characteristics of the hadron colliders that will contribute to the study of the top quark and higgs boson . the combination of the fermilab tevatron and the new main injector with the cdf and d  detectors will in the future bring us @xmath7 collisions at 2 tev . in fermilab parlance ,",
    "the data now under analysis come from run i : 100 pb@xmath8 at 1.8 tev , recorded in 19941996 .",
    "we look forward to the first 2-tev data .",
    "the approved quantum of data is run ii : 2 fb@xmath8 in 20002002 . beyond the approved running ,",
    "we are enthusiastic about the physics prospects for another high - luminosity run while the tevatron defines the energy frontier .",
    "although the laboratory hasnt taken a position , we refer to this possibility as run iii : 30 fb@xmath8 by the year 2006 .    on that time scale ,",
    "the large hadron collider at cern will open the study of @xmath9 collisions at 14 tev in the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "a modest goal for the beginning of the lhc era is to accumulate @xmath10 in 20052009 .",
    "three elements inform the way we think about experiments in these high - energy hadron colliders .",
    "first , they promise high sensitivity from high integrated luminosity .",
    "second , the success of @xmath11-tagging in the hadron - collider environment encourages the hope that heavy - flavor tags , and perhaps even triggers , can make future experiments more sensitive to the exotic events that may signal new physics .",
    "i have in mind here both the cdf silicon microvertex detector ( svx ) , with resolution @xmath12 , and the `` soft''-lepton tag used by cdf and d  to identify the transition @xmath13 .",
    "third , both the physics and the experimental approach to the new energy regime are colored by the great mass of the top quark .",
    "the top quark has been observed at the tevatron in the reaction @xcite in the tevatron experiments , the @xmath11-quarks are identified as displaced vertices or through soft - lepton tags .",
    "the channels studied to date are dileptons ( including @xmath14 ) , lepton + jets , and all jets .",
    "the top mass has already been determined to impressive precision .",
    "an `` unofficial '' average including the latest data from cdf and d  is @xcite @xmath15    within the electroweak theory , fermion masses are set by the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath16 and by apparently arbitrary yukawa couplings , @xmath17 it is striking that the top quark s yukawa coupling @xmath18 .",
    "does this mean that top is special , or might top be the only `` normal '' fermion , with a mass close to the electroweak scale ?",
    "the top - quark lifetime is governed by the semiweak decay @xmath19 ; the decay width is given by @xcite @xmath20 if there are three generations of quarks , so that we can use @xmath21 unitarity to determine @xmath22 , then @xmath23 .",
    "this corresponds to a top lifetime , @xmath24 that is very short compared with the time - scale for confinement , @xmath25 as a consequence , the top quark decays before it can be hadronized .",
    "no discrete lines will be observed in the @xmath26 spectrum , and there will be no dressed hadronic states containing top .",
    "this freedom from the confining effects of the strong interaction means that the characteristics of top production and the hadronic environment near top in phase space should be calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "the fact that top is , in this sense , the purest , freest quark we have to study will have important consequences for future experiments .",
    "it is useful to summarize some important characteristics of top pair production . at the tevatron , at 1.8 tev ,",
    "the top - pair production cross section is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "approximately 90% arises from the reaction @xmath28 , and only about 10% from the reaction @xmath29 .",
    "top is a heavy particle for the tevatron , and this is reflected in the dominance of @xmath30 collisions .",
    "the measured cross sections are in reasonable accord with this estimate .",
    "cdf measures @xmath31 @xcite , while d  has determined @xmath32 @xcite .    at the lhc ,",
    "the pair - production cross section rises to @xmath33 .",
    "the origin of the top events is markedly different . in 14-tev @xmath9 collisions , the reaction @xmath28 accounts for only about 10% of the rate , whereas @xmath34 accounts for 90% . at the lhc",
    ", top will be a moderately light particle .      for run",
    "ii , the tevatron energy will increase to @xmath35 .",
    "accordingly , the top - pair production cross section will rise by about 40% . in a run of @xmath36 at 2 tev",
    ", approximately 225k @xmath26 pairs will be produced .",
    "i show in table [ tab : tops ] a _",
    "snowmass 96 _ projection of the number of top events available for study in the tevatron s run ii and run iii @xcite .",
    ".anticipated top - quark yields in future tevatron runs [ cols=\"<,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can make this result a little more transparent by plotting , in figure [ needed ] , the luminosity needed for a three- or five - standard - deviation observation of the higgs boson at the tevatron .",
    "we see that , in the @xmath37 modes discussed , an integrated luminosity of @xmath38 is insufficient to detect the standard - model higgs boson at an interesting mass .",
    "about @xmath39 would permit the observation of a higgs boson discovered at lep2 , while @xmath36 would make it possible to explore masses up to about @xmath40 . with about @xmath39",
    ", one could expect a 3-@xmath41 indication for the higgs boson throughout the low - mass rgime .",
    "a slightly different cut on the same information is provided in figure [ signif ] .",
    "there i show the significance of observations in the @xmath37 and @xmath42 channels for runs of 2 and @xmath36 .",
    "while the @xmath42 channel probably would not suffice for an independent discovery , it could provide good supporting evidence  and complementary measurements  to an observation in @xmath37 .",
    "if the higgs boson is discovered at lep2 , then it should be observed at the tevatron in @xmath37 with @xmath43 .",
    "if the higgs boson lies beyond the reach of lep2 , @xmath44 , then a 5-@xmath41 discovery will be possible in the @xmath37 channel in a future run iii of the tevatron @xmath45 for masses up to @xmath46 .",
    "this prospect is the most powerful incentive that we have for run iii . to support this discovery ,",
    "a 3-@xmath41 observation will be possible in @xmath42 in run iii for masses up to @xmath47 . in combination",
    ", the two observations at the tevatron would imply a @xmath48 measurement of the ratio of couplings @xmath49 .",
    "if the coupling strength @xmath50 and the branching fraction @xmath51 are known from experiments at lep2 , the observations at the tevatron would make it possible to determine @xmath52 to @xmath53 . over the range of masses accessible at the tevatron",
    ", it should be possible to determine the mass of the higgs boson to @xmath54 .",
    "the capabilities of the lhc experiments to search for , and study , the higgs boson are thoroughly documented in the technical proposals @xcite .",
    "i will confine myself here to a few summary comments .",
    "a 5-@xmath41 discovery is possible up to @xmath55 in a combination of the channels and @xmath56 the reach of lhc experiments can be extended by making use of the channels and for higgs - boson masses below about @xmath57 , it should be possible to determine the higgs mass to 100-@xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the tevatron exists , and will produce important results on the top quark and higgs boson through the next decade .",
    "we can expect considerable improvements in the determinations of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , as well as increasingly telling searches for nonstandard production and decay in run ii ( @xmath38 ) . in the realm of what might be possible thereafter , what we have called run iii ( @xmath36 )",
    "holds great promise for refining our knowledge of top properties , including the measurement of @xmath61 in single - top production .",
    "run iii would also extend the search for a light higgs boson throughout the low - mass region favored by supersymmetry . on a related note ,",
    "if low - scale supersymmetry exists , there is every reason to expect that it should be found at the tevatron .    during the week of this workshop",
    ", the united states sealed its commitment to participate in the construction of the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "the lhc will be a fountain of tops : @xmath62 million pairs will be produced per year at a luminosity of @xmath63 ; hundreds to thousands of interesting events will be detected each day .",
    "the lhc will extend the search for the agent of electroweak symmetry breaking toward @xmath64 .",
    "it will have good sensitivity to the standard - model higgs boson throughout the interesting range .",
    "the lhc will explore the spectrum of superpartners up to @xmath65 and make possible detailed measurements of supersymmetric parameters .",
    "opening a new energy frontier , the lhc will also offer many other possibilities for exploration .",
