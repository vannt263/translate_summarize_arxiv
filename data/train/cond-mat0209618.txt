    "in recent years , it has become clear that the eigenfunctions of noninteracting disordered systems at the critical point of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) have multifractal scaling properties .",
    "hence , multifractal analysis has become a standard tool for treating the strong wave - function fluctuations which arise near criticality .",
    "@xcite one way to characterize wave - function statistics is through the corresponding multifractal @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "this spectrum of the local density is universal at the critical point , and the exponents such as @xmath2 , which describes the scaling behavior of the typical local electron density , are suitable for describing the phase transition .",
    "@xcite finding the true @xmath0 curve is essential in order to fully understand mits .",
    "mits depend on the dimensionality and symmetries of the system and can occur in both the strong disorder and the weak disorder regime ( strong - coupling or weak - coupling regime , respectively , in the language of field theory ) .",
    "each regime is characterized by the corresponding coupling strength that depends on the ratio between diagonal disorder and the off - diagonal transition matrix elements of the hamiltonian . @xcite",
    "we wish to point out that most of the already published analytical results concerning the @xmath0 spectrum , which we summarize in the next paragraphs , have been obtained in the weak disorder limit ( weak - coupling approach ) .    using the renormalization group in @xmath3 dimensions ( @xmath4 ) , it was found @xcite that the singularity spectrum is parabolic , @xmath5 up to @xmath6 .",
    "this equation was justified for the case of unbroken time - reversal symmetry ( orthogonal universality class ) in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "5 it was found that a parabolic spectrum ( ps ) is fulfilled for the critical wave function of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermion in a random vector potential ( chiral universality class ) .",
    "these results were obtained by mapping the problem to a gaussian field theory in an ultrametric space ( a cayley tree ) . for a deep understanding of the origin of the multifractal behavior in this model , see also ref .",
    "the field - theoretical approaches in the context of the integer quantum hall transition ( unitary universality class ) has been addressed more recently .",
    "based on the application of conformal field theory to the critical point of a 2d euclidean field theory , bhaseen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite conjectured that the singularity spectrum is exactly parabolic at the plateau transitions .",
    "using the same general principles of conformal field theory , @xcite a ps was conjectured for a closely related quantity , the two - point conductance .",
    "given the present status of this problem , it would be highly desirable to check ( i ) whether the ps is fulfilled at weak disorder strength and ( ii ) whether or not the ps holds in the strong disorder regime , where it is known that all realistic mits , such as the conventional anderson transition in 3d , take place .",
    "unfortunately , because of the absence of a small parameter , no quantitative predictions for the critical properties and , in particular , for the @xmath0 spectrum have been made in the strong - coupling regime . in the absence of such predictions",
    ", the problem must be addressed using numerical calculations .",
    "that is why we are interested in exploring the role of the disorder strength on the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "specifically , we want to analyze how the singularity spectrum evolves in the face of increasing coupling strength , i.e. , when the transition shifts from the weak disorder regime to the strong disorder regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "i , we introduce the model and the methods used for the calculations .",
    "the results for the multifractal spectrum in 1d and 2d are shown in secs .",
    "ii a and ii b , respectively .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "for computation of the multifractal spectrum , we use the standard box - counting procedure , @xcite first dividing the system of @xmath7 sites into @xmath8 boxes of linear size @xmath9 and determining the box probability of the wave function in the @xmath10 box by @xmath11 , where the summation is restricted to sites within that box and @xmath12 denotes the amplitude of an eigenstate with energy @xmath13 at site @xmath14 .",
    "the normalized @xmath15th moments of this probability @xmath16 constitute a measure . from this",
    ", the lipschitz - hlder exponent or singularity strength can be obtained , @xcite @xmath17 as well as the corresponding fractal dimension @xmath18 which yields the characteristic singularity spectrum @xmath0 in a parametric representation . in eqs .",
    "( [ alfadeq ] ) and ( [ fdeq ] ) , @xmath19 denotes the ratio of the box sizes and the system size .",
    "if the @xmath15th moments of the measure counted in all boxes are proportional to a power @xmath20 of the box size , @xmath21 , multifractal behavior may be derived .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum and the mass exponent @xmath20 are related by a symmetric legendre transformation , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . from eq .",
    "( [ parap ] ) , one can easily obtain @xmath25 in what follows , we will first use this relation to check whether or not the ps is valid in each regime studied .",
    "first , @xmath26 and @xmath27 were calculated for different system sizes and then extrapolated to the macroscopic limit @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we wish to clarify that the calculation of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is suitable only if the conditions @xcite @xmath30 are satisfied , where @xmath31 is the localization or correlation length and @xmath32 is the lattice spacing ( or any microscopic length scale of the system , such as the cyclotron radius ) .",
    "usually , the disorder - induced mit is investigated for hamiltonians with short - range , off - diagonal matrix elements ( e.g. , the canonical anderson model ) .",
    "another class of hamiltonian exhibiting an mit in arbitrary dimension @xmath33 is formed by those that include long - range hopping terms .",
    "the effect of long - range hopping on localization was originally considered by anderson @xcite for randomly distributed impurities in @xmath33 dimensions with the @xmath34 hopping interaction .",
    "it is known @xcite that all states are extended for @xmath35 , whereas for @xmath36 , the states are localized .",
    "thus , one can study the mit by varying the exponent @xmath37 at fixed disorder strength . at the transition line @xmath38",
    ", a real - space renormalization group can be constructed for the distribution of couplings .",
    "@xcite these models are most convenient for studying critical properties because the exact critical point is known ( @xmath38 ) and they allows us to treat the 1d and 2d cases , thus reaching larger system sizes and reducing the numerical effort . here , we will concentrate on the 1d and 2d versions of these models with orthogonal symmetry . in our calculations",
    ", we consider a small energy window , containing about 8% of the states around the center of the spectral band .",
    "the number of random realizations is such that the number of critical states included for each @xmath39 is roughly @xmath40 , while in order to reduce the edge effects , periodic boundary conditions in all directions are included . using methods based on level statistics",
    ", we checked that the normalized nearest level variances @xcite are indeed scale invariant at each critical point studied .",
    "first , we concentrate on the intensively studied power - law random banded matrix model ( prbm ) .",
    "@xcite the corresponding hamiltonian that describes a disordered 1d sample with random long - range hopping is represented by real symmetric matrices , whose entries are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean , @xmath41 , and a variance which depends on the distance between lattice sites , @xmath42 the model describes a whole family of critical theories parametrized by @xmath43 , which determines the critical dimensionless conductance in the same way as the dimensionality labels the different anderson transitions . in the two limiting cases @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which correspond to the weak and the strong disorder limits , respectively ,",
    "some critical properties have been derived analytically .",
    "@xcite the system size ranges between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to values of @xmath49 , which correspond to @xmath50 .    using the exact eigenstates of eq .",
    "( [ h1dor ] ) from numerical diagonalizations , we obtained the size dependence of the scaling exponents @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the critical point of the finite system . in order to extrapolate to macroscopic systems ,",
    "we propose a finite - size correction to @xmath51 , where the irrelevant exponent @xmath52 .",
    "for all values of @xmath15 , we found that the exponent @xmath53 hardly differs from unity .",

    "6 , a curve of the form @xmath126 was fitted to the data points in this graph , where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are three positive fitting parameters , and @xmath130 is a function which goes to zero as @xmath122 .",
    "note that this fit was performed only over the larger values of @xmath121 where convergence was evident .",
    "various forms for @xmath130 were chosen and tested on the data plots .",
    "these included exponential , inverse logarithmic , and power - law decay with @xmath121 .",

    "the form of @xmath130 eventually chosen was the exponential law .",
    "the reason for choosing the above form of @xmath130 with preference to the alternative forms was simply that the inverse logarithmic and the power laws do not fit our data properly .",
    "thus , the small and large @xmath121-dependent behavior of @xmath116 can be described by @xmath131 the solid lines in the inset of fig .",

    "for this value of @xmath117 , we found @xmath139 , indicating that we are very close to the regime where deviations are practically unobservable .",
    "these authors found deviations ( downwards ) from ps mainly for the largest negative @xmath15 values .",
    "we believe that these deviations are due to the use of the finite - size value of @xmath2 .",
    "if the extrapolated value of @xmath140 is used instead , the agreement with the ps is fairly good .    before concluding",
    ", we must admit that experiments to measure @xmath2 or related multifractal exponents have not been carried out .",
    "however , the statistical properties of wave functions are close related to the conductance statistics . as was demonstrated in ref .",

    "our calculations strongly suggest that the parabolic spectrum completely breaks down for large values of the disorder strength , and more importantly , that all corrections to the parabolic shape vanish ( within our numerical uncertainties ) at a finite value of the coupling constant .",
    "the question arises as to whether these results are applicable to other quantum systems , particularly in the 3d anderson transition that occurs in the strong disorder domain , and whose similarity with the prbm model at @xmath67 has been demonstrated for several critical magnitudes .",
    "@xcite another interesting question is whether the deviations studied here also have signatures in other properties , such as spectral statistics or generalized dimensions .",
    "finally , how the present 2d model can be studied , using 2d conformal field theory or locator expansion instead of the resonance pair approximation , remains to be resolved ."
