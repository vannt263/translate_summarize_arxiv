    "this paper is devoted to preasymptotic error estimates of some continuous interior penalty finite element method ( cip - fem ) and the finite element method ( fem ) for the following helmholtz problem : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary , @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the imaginary unit , and @xmath11 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath12 .",
    "the above helmholtz problem is an approximation of the acoustic scattering problem ( with time dependence @xmath13 ) and @xmath2 is known as the wave number .",
    "the robin boundary condition is known as the first order approximation of the radiation condition ( cf .",
    "we remark that the helmholtz problem  also arises in applications as a consequence of frequency domain treatment of attenuated scalar waves ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known that the finite element method of fixed order for the helmholtz problem  at high frequencies ( @xmath14 ) is subject to the effect of pollution : the ratio of the error of the finite element solution to the error of the best approximation from the finite element space can not be uniformly bounded with respect to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , given that the exact solution @xmath15 in a space @xmath16 with norm @xmath17 and the finite element solution @xmath18 in a discrete space @xmath19 , the pollution error may be defined as follows ( cf .",
    "assume that an estimate of the following form holds : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are independent of @xmath2 and the mesh size @xmath5 .",
    "then the finite element solution is said to be _ polluted _ and the following term is called _ pollution error _ : @xmath23 clearly , estimating the pollution error is significant both in theory and practice , and it has always been interesting to propose numerical methods which induce less pollution error and consequently , cheap methods @xcite .",
    "we recall that , the term  asymptotic error estimate \" refers to the error estimate without pollution error and the term  preasymptotic error estimate \" refers to the estimate with non - negligible pollution effect .",
    "the highly indefinite nature of helmholtz problem with high wave number makes the error analysis of the fem very difficult . the standard duality argument ( or schatz argument )",
    "@xcite ) gives only asymptotic error estimates under the mesh condition that @xmath24 is small enough , but it is too strict for large @xmath2 . in 1990",
    "s , ihlenburg and babuka @xcite considered the one dimensional problem discretized on equidistant grids , and proved preasymptotic error estimates under the condition that @xmath25 for some constant less than @xmath26 .",
    "based on a profound stability estimate of the exact solution by decomposing it into a nonoscillatory elliptic part and an oscillatory analytic part , and the standard duality argument , melenk and sauter @xcite considered one and higher dimensional problems , and showed that the fem ( with fixed @xmath6 ) is pollution free under the condition that @xmath27 is small enough .",
    "more recently , zhu and wu @xcite gave the first preasymptotic error analysis for higher dimensional problems by combining the stability from @xcite and a new modified duality argument .",
    "it was shown that the pollution term in the @xmath0 error estimate is @xmath4 , which is exactly of the same order as the phase error obtained by dispersion analysis @xcite , under the mesh condition @xmath28 is sufficiently small .",
    "we remark that results on the @xmath29 version of the fem were also obtained in @xcite .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to prove the same preasymptotic error bound for the fem with fixed order @xmath6 but under a weaker condition that @xmath3 is sufficiently small .",
    "note that this condition is quite practical since a useful numerical solution must has a sufficiently small pollution error which is also @xmath4 . in order to prove this preasymptotic error estimate ,",
    "we first develope some discrete sobolev theory on fe spaces",
    ". then we decompose the error of the fe solution @xmath18 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an elliptic projection , and we bound @xmath1-norm of @xmath32 by its high order discrete sobolev norms in the duality argument step ( instead of its @xmath0 norm as the standard schatz argument ) .",
    "note that our new estimates improves the previous results in the case of @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the cip - fem , which was first proposed by douglas and dupont @xcite for elliptic and parabolic problems in 1970 s and then successfully applied to convection - dominated problems as a stabilization technique @xcite , uses the same approximation space as the fem but modifies the sesquilinear form of the fem by adding a least squares term penalizing the jump of the normal derivative of the discrete solution at mesh interfaces .",
    "recently the cip - fem has shown great potential in solving the helmholtz problem  with large wave number @xcite .",
    "it is absolute stable if the the penalty parameters are chosen as complex numbers with positive imaginary parts , it satisfies an error bound no larger than that of the fem under the same mesh condition , its penalty parameters may be tuned to greatly reduce the pollution error , and so on .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to generalize the cip - fem by penalizing jumps of higher normal derivatives of the discrete solution at mesh interfaces and to prove the same preasymptotic error estimate as that of the fem .",
    "note that for the linear case @xmath34 , the cip - fem remains unchanged . for higher order case @xmath33 , we add more penalty terms on jumps of higher ( up to @xmath6-th order ) normal derivatives , because we found by dispersion analysis that the pollution error of the new cip - fem for one dimensional problem may be removed completely by choosing appropriate penalty parameters ( see section  [ sec - num ] ) , while it is hard to do so for the classical cip - fem with only penalty terms on the jump of first order normal derivative .",
    "we use such penalty parameters from one dimensional dispersion analysis to compute a model problem in two dimensions on cartesian grids and find that the pollution effect is almost invisible for the wave number @xmath2 up to 1000 for the cip - fem with order @xmath35 .",
    "for simplicity , our theoretical analysis for the cip - fem is restrict to the case of _ real _ penalty parameters .",
    "the proofs are quite similar to those of the fem , except the additional penalty terms should be carefully dealt with . for preasymptotic and asymptotic error analyses of other methods including discontinuous galerkin methods and spectral methods , we refer to ( * ? ? ?",

    "some preliminary results , including the stability of the continuous solution , the approximation properties of the finite element space , and estimates of the elliptic projection and @xmath1 projection , are cited or proved in section  [ sec - pre ] . in section  [ sec - sob ] , we introduce discrete sobolev norms of arbitrary order by using the discrete elliptic operator and develop useful properties on the discrete sobolev norms .",
