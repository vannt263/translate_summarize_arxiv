    "the interest in the pinning of the abrikosov vortex lattice by impurities was revived recently with the discovery of high - tc superconductors .",
    "impurity disorder conflicts with the long range translational order of the flux lattice and some glassy state is generally expected to appear .",
    "understanding the precise nature of this new thermodynamic state and how it depends on the type of disorder existing in the system is very important for the determination of the transport properties of these materials , such as critical currents and i - v characteristics .",
    "this problem , however , is only one aspect of the more fundamental and broader question of the effect of quenched impurities on any translationally ordered structure , such as a crystal .",
    "this question arises in a large number of physical systems under current active experimental study .",
    "examples are charge density waves @xcite , wigner crystals @xcite magnetic bubbles @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , the surface of crystals with quenched bulk or substrate disorder @xcite , domain walls in incommensurate solids @xcite .",
    "all these systems have in common a perfectly ordered underlying structure modified by elastic distortions and possibly by topological defects such as dislocations , due to temperature or disorder .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations alone on three - dimensional and especially on two - dimensional structures is by now well understood , and it was shown that topological defects are not important in the low temperature solid phase @xcite .",
    "much less is known however on the additional effects of quenched disorder . in particular , the important question of precisely how quenched disorder destroys the translational long range order of the lattice is far from being elucidated .",
    "if disorder is strong , the underlying order is a priori destroyed at every scale and an analytical description of the problem starting from the abrikosov lattice is difficult .",
    "one then has to use a more macroscopic approach based on phenomenological models such as the gauge glass models @xcite .",
    "the success of these approaches then crucially depends on whether these effective models are indeed a good representation of the system at large scale , a largely uncontrolled assumption .",
    "if disorder is weak enough , however , one expects the perfect lattice to survive at short scales .",
    "thus a natural first step for a theoretical description is to neglect dislocations and to treat the simpler problem of an elastic medium submitted to weak impurities . in that case",
    "one can consider a gaussian random potential created by many weak impurities with short - range correlations . in this paper",
    "we will focus on point - like disorder .",
    "the problem of correlated disorder , such as columnar or twin boundary pinning in superconductors @xcite , which is also relevant for any type of _ quantum _ problems can be treated by similar methods , and is examined in details in ref . .",
    "this simpler problem of an elastic lattice in presence of weak disorder is already quite non trivial . despite several attempts ,",
    "its physics has not been completely understood .",
    "an important quantity , which measures how fast translational order decays , is the translational correlation function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the displacement from the perfect lattice and @xmath13 one of the first reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the thermodynamic average and the disorder average respectively .",
    "@xmath16 can be extracted from the fourier transform of the density - density correlation function at wavevectors near @xmath17 , or directly measured by imaging the deformed lattice , and is thus a quantity easily accessible in experiments .    a first calculation of @xmath16",
    "was performed by larkin @xcite using a model in which weak _ random forces _ act independently on each vortex .",
    "these forces are correlated over a small length @xmath18 , of the order of the superconducting coherence length .",
    "this model predicts that weak disorder destroys translational order below four dimensions @xcite and @xmath19 .",
    "the destruction of the long range order in this simple gaussian model can be understood easily from the standard imry - ma argument . to accommodate the random forces a region of size",
    "@xmath20 will undergo relative deformations of order @xmath21 .",
    "the cost in elastic energy is @xmath22 , while the gain in potential energy is @xmath23 .",
    "the optimal is thus @xmath24 leading to the above decay of @xmath16 . using similar arguments in the presence of an external lorentz force",
    ", larkin and ovchinikov @xcite constructed a theory of collective pinning of the flux lattice . in this theory",
    "the critical current is determined from the length scale @xmath25 at which relative displacements are or order @xmath26 .",
    "this theory was very successful in describing conventional superconductors .",
    "however , a need to reconsider this theory was prompted by high tc superconductors where the flux lattice is usually probed at larger scales .",
    "it turns out that the larkin model , while it is useful for estimating critical currents , can not be used to study large scale quantities such as translational order .",
    "in fact the purely gaussian model with random forces , and the resulting linear elasticity , becomes inadequate beyond the larkin - ovchinikov length @xmath25 .",
    "it has only one trivial equilibrium state and responds linearly to external force .",
    "it is thus too simple to approximate correctly the full non linear problem and grossly overestimates the effect of disorder . at larger scales",
    "the lattice starts behaving collectively as an elastic manifold in a _",
    "random potential _ with many metastable states , thus the exponential decay of @xmath16 in @xmath6 can not hold beyond @xmath27 . using known results on the so - called `` random manifold '' problem , feigelman et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the system presents glassy behavior and computed transport properties .",
    "this was also pointed out by bouchaud , mzard and yedidia ( bmy ) @xcite , who used the gaussian variational method ( gmv ) to study this problem , and found a power - law roughening of the lattice with stretched exponential decay of @xmath16 .",
    "however , the _ periodicity _ of the lattice was not properly taken into account in all the above works .",
    "the periodicity has important consequences for the behavior of correlation functions at large scales .",
    "indeed , it was suggested with the use of qualitative flory arguments , that periodicity leads to logarithmic roughening @xcite , rather than a power law .    in this paper",
    "we develop a quantitative description of the static properties of a lattice in the presence of disorder .",
    "a short account of some of the results of this paper were presented in a recent letter @xcite .",
    "we take into account both the existence of many metastable states and the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "one of the difficulties in the physics of this problem is that the disorder varies at a much shorter length scale than the lattice spacing . as a consequence",
    "the elastic limit has to be taken with some care .",
    "indeed in this limit the displacement varies slowly , but the density still consists in a series of peaks . to couple the density to the random potential it is thus important to distinguish between its slowly varying components @xmath28 and its fourier component @xmath29 close to the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "this separation of harmonics exposes clearly the physics and allows to treat all the regimes in length scales in a simple way . to study the resulting model",
    ", we mainly use the gaussian variational method , developed to study manifold in random media @xcite .",
    "we also use the renormalization group ( rg ) close to @xmath30 dimensions and in @xmath31 dimensions .",
    "comparison of the two methods provides a confirmation of the accuracy of the gvm .",
    "one the main results of the present study , which is somewhat surprising in view of conventional wisdom based on larkin s original calculation , is that quasi - long range order survives in the system .",
    "this means that @xmath16 decays as a power law at large distance .",
    "such a property for disordered lattice is similar to the quasi - order found for clean two - dimensional solids .",
    "this state however has the peculiar property of being a glass with many metastable states , and at the same time show bragg peaks as a solid does . for these reasons we would like to call it a `` bragg glass '' .",
    "note that this is a much stronger property that the so - called `` hexatic glass '' @xcite since hexatic order in the elastic limit is a straightforward consequence of the absence of dislocations . in the bragg glass ,",
    "two important length scales control the crossover towards the asymptotic decay , a consequence of the fact that the disorder varies at a much smaller scale than the lattice spacing @xmath32 .",
    "when the mean square of the relative displacement @xmath33 ^ 2 \\rangle}$ ] of two vortices as a function of their separation @xmath34 is shorter than the square of the lindemann length @xmath35 , the thermal wandering of the lines averages enough over the random potential and the model becomes equivalent to the random force larkin model . at low enough temperature ,",
    "@xmath36 is replaced by the correlation length of the random potential @xmath18 , which is of the order of the superconducting coherence length . in that case",
    "the crossover length is @xmath25 . when the relative displacement is larger than the correlation length of the random potential but smaller than the lattice spacing @xmath32 , this is the random manifold regime where each line sees effectively an independent random potential .",
    "when the relative displacement becomes larger than the lattice spacing , one enters the asymptotic quasi - ordered regime .",
    "this occurs for separations of order @xmath37 . in general the two lengths @xmath25 and @xmath37 are widely different .",
    "the theory developed here can be applied to any elastic system in the elastic limit @xmath38 . in relation with experimental systems we focus particularly on the triangular abrikosov lattice in @xmath39 , point vortices in thin films and magnetic bubbles in @xmath10 , and will also mention lines in a plane @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we will not treat topological defects quantitatively .",
    "although a full description of a lattice in presence of disorder should also include topological defects , their effect might not be as severe as commonly believed from misleading imry - ma type arguments .",
    "indeed the fact that within the elastic theory quasi - long range order is preserved at large distances makes the system much more stable to dislocations . since in @xmath6",
    "the core energy of a dislocation increases as its size @xmath40 , it is actually very possible that a phase without unbound dislocations exists in @xmath6 in the presence of weak disorder .",
    "indeed , bitter decoration experiments @xcite at the highest fields available , about 70 g for these low - fields experiments , show remarkably large regions free of dislocations . in recent neutron experiments",
    "@xcite it was shown that the degree of order depends on the way the system is prepared .",
    "a more perfect lattice with a smaller number of dislocations was prepared by first driving the system at a velocity high enough for translational order to heal , and then slowing it back down to zero velocity .",
    "it is thus conceivable that in @xmath6 the presence of dislocations is overall a non - equilibrium feature . in two dimensions ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "dislocations are energetically less costly and will probably appear at large scales , although this has not yet been firmly established .",
    "however , as we will discuss here , the length scale between unbound dislocations @xmath41 can be much larger than @xmath37 in a low temperature regime .",
    "in that regime the main cause of the decay of translational order is elastic deformations due to disorder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : for convenience we have separated the mostly technical sections ( [ simplified ] ) and ( [ degal4 ] ) from the one discussing applications to physical systems ( [ degal3 ] ) and ( [ degal2 ] ) . in section ( [ derivation ] ) , we introduce the model and derive the correct elastic limit",
    ". simple dimensional arguments  la fukuyama - lee are given to identify the relevant length scales . in section ( [ simplified ] ) we apply the gaussian variational method to a simplified isotropic version of the model .",
    "thus the method can be exposed without being obscured by unnecessary technical complications specific to real vortex lattices such as anisotropy and non - local elasticity , while the essential physics is retained .",
    "this section contains most of the technical details and methods used .",
    "we explain why a previous application of the variational method by bmy led to erroneous conclusions about the behavior at large scales .",
    "in section ( [ degal3 ] ) we apply the theory to @xmath39 solids such as the vortex lattices using a realistic elastic hamiltonian .",
    "we compute the translational order correlation function @xmath16 with the full crossover between the three regimes in distance .",
    "we discuss the experimental signatures for decoration and neutron diffraction experiments . in particular the results of a comparison between decoration images and theoretical predictions",
    "are mentioned and detailed predictions are made for the neutron diffraction intensities .",
    "we then give a simple physical interpretation of the various regimes in distance and also argue that dislocations are less likely to appear as commonly believed .",
    "in section ( [ degal4 ] ) we apply the functional renormalization group in @xmath42 , and compare its findings with those of the variational method . in section ( [ degal2 ] )",
    "we examine two - dimensional systems , for which thermal fluctuations play a more important role .",
    "we first apply the variational method which shows that below a critical temperature @xmath43 the system is glassy with logarithmic growth of displacements .",
    "this is compared to predictions of the renormalization group in @xmath7 .",
    "we then give a physical discussion of what should be expected for @xmath10 systems , such as magnetic bubbles , where dislocations have to be considered .",
    "conclusion can be found in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "finally the bold and brave can look at the appendices where most of the most tedious technicalities are relegated .",
    "in the absence of disorder the vortices form , at equilibrium , a perfect lattice of spacing @xmath32 whose sites are labeled by an integer @xmath44 and position will be denoted by @xmath45 . since we want to apply this theory also to a lattice of vortex lines , we consider the more general case where the @xmath45 are @xmath46-component lattice vectors and there is in addition @xmath47 transverse directions denoted by @xmath48 so that the total spatial dimension is @xmath49 . throughout this paper",
    "we will denote the @xmath49 dimensional coordinates by @xmath50 and similarly the fourier space ( momentum ) coordinates by @xmath51 .",
    "for example , the abrikosov lattice corresponds to @xmath52 and @xmath6 and @xmath48 is along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the displacements relative to the equilibrium positions are denoted by the @xmath46 component vector @xmath53 . for weak disorder ( @xmath54 where @xmath37 is defined below ) and in the absence of dislocations , it is legitimate to assume that @xmath55 is slowly varying on the scale of the lattice and to use a continuum elastic energy , as a function of the continuous variable @xmath56 .",
    "we consider the simple elastic hamiltonian : @xmath57 where @xmath58 labels the coordinates , and @xmath59 denotes the brillouin zone .",
    "the @xmath60 are the elastic matrix .",
    "such an elastic description is valid as long as the _ relative _ displacement of two neighboring points remains small i.e. @xmath61 , but does _ not _ suppose the individual displacements themselves to be small .",
    "we differ the study of the realistic elastic hamiltonian ( [ real ] ) until sections [ degal3 ] and [ degal2 ] , and in order to illustrate the method in sections [ derivation ] and [ simplified ] we use the fully isotropic elastic hamiltonian @xmath62 corresponding to the case @xmath63 .    in the limit where many weak impurities act collectively on a vortex",
    "the disorder can be modeled by a gaussian random potential @xmath64 with correlations : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a short range function of range @xmath18 ( the superconducting coherence length ) and fourier transform @xmath67 .",
    "the other limit , corresponding to a few strong pins , can be modeled by a poissonian distribution and will not be considered here . since the density of vortices at a given point is given by @xmath68 the total hamiltonian is therefore @xmath69    the simplest way to recover translational invariance , is to use the well - known replica trick @xcite .",
    "this amounts to introduce @xmath70 identical systems by replicating the original hamiltonian .",
    "it is then possible to average over disorder , the proper quenched average being recovered in the limit @xmath71 . after replicating , the interaction term becomes @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the replica indices .",
    "( [ intor ] ) can be rewritten @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the replica indices . as we show in the following section it is extremely important to keep the discrete nature of the lattice in ( [ interaction ] ) , and the continuum limit of @xmath76",
    "should be done with some care .      using the form ( [ interaction ] ) for the hamiltonian in term of the displacement fields",
    "@xmath77 is rather cumbersome .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) leads to a non local theory , even in the limit where the disorder is completely uncorrelated @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , vortices belonging to two different replica sets can be a priori at the same point in space @xmath79 while having very different equilibrium positions @xmath80 .",
    "this occurs when the displacements of the vortices are large enough . since @xmath45 , the equilibrium position of the vortices , have clearly no physical significance , except as an internal label , it is much more convenient to use instead a label that is a function of the actual position of the vortices .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing the slowly varying field @xmath81 such a field will allow the continuum limit of ( [ interaction ] ) to be taken easily . for each configuration of disorder , or alternatively for each replica set , one introduces a different field @xmath82 .",
    "such a labeling is always exact when the transverse dimension @xmath46 is @xmath83 @xcite . in more than one transverse dimension ,",
    "this representation assumes the absence of dislocations in the system . in a self consistent manner",
    ", we will justify a posteriori both assumptions of elasticity and absence of dislocations using the solution in sections ( [ selfconsist ] ) and ( [ discussion ] ) .",
    "using @xmath84 the density can be rewritten as ( see appendix  [ density ] ) @xmath85 \\sum_k e^{i{k}\\cdot\\phi(x)}\\ ] ] where the @xmath86 are the vectors of the reciprocal lattice and @xmath87 is the average density .",
    "in the elastic limit one can expand ( [ transp ] ) to get @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the usual translational order parameter defined in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath86 .",
    "expression ( [ transparent ] ) respects the periodicity of the lattice i.e. is obviously invariant by a global translation @xmath90 .",
    "another advantage of the decomposition ( [ transparent ] ) is that the various fourier components of the density relative to the periodicity of the ordered lattice appear clearly in @xmath76 @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the part of the random potential with fourier components close to @xmath86 . since the energy is invariant when changing @xmath93 , @xmath21 itself can not appear in the expression ( [ couplage ] ) , but only @xmath94 , and in principle higher derivatives , or a periodic function of @xmath21 are allowed .    the first term in the right hand side of ( [ couplage ] )",
    "is the part of the deformation of the lattice that couples to the long wavelength of the disorder potential .",
    "it results in an increase or decrease of the average density in regions where the potential is favorable or unfavorable .",
    "the second term couples to the higher fourier components of the disorder .",
    "the average density is not affected but the lattice can be shifted so that the lines sit in the minimum of the disorder potential . in the usual elasticity theory ,",
    "one takes the continuum limit for the displacement field * and * assumes that the density itself is smooth on the scale of the lattice .",
    "this allows to keep only the gradient term in ( [ couplage ] ) . here",
    "although it is possible to take the continuum limit for the displacements @xmath21 since they vary slowly on the scale of the vortex lattice ( @xmath95 ) , it is imperative to retain the discrete nature of the density . this is because the scale at which the disorder varies ( for superconductors it is comparable to the scale of the real atomic crystal ) is usually shorter than the lattice spacing of the vortex lattice itself .",
    "if one uses the representation ( [ transparent ] ) of the density and ( [ interaction ] ) and discard spatial averages of rapidly oscillating terms , the replicated hamiltonian becomes , in the isotropic case : @xmath96 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to be rigorous the last terms in ( [ cardyos ] ) should be written in term of @xmath97 rather than @xmath56 , but this has no effect on our results .",
    "it leads only to corrections of higher order in @xmath98 which we neglect since we work in the elastic limit @xmath54 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ cardyos ] ) will be our starting model , and from now on we absorb the coefficient @xmath99 in @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "a general property of the hamiltonian ( [ cardyos ] ) is the invariance of the disorder term under the transformation @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an arbitrary function of @xmath34 .",
    "this statistical invariance _ guarantees _ that the elastic term in ( [ cardyos ] ) is unrenormalized by disorder .",
    "note that in the _ original _ non local model ( [ interaction ] ) this symmetry is only approximate , and indeed one would find there a small ( of order @xmath104 ) and unimportant renormalization of the elastic coefficients by disorder .",
    "the principal quantities of interest are the mean squared relative displacement @xmath9 of two vortices , averaged over disorder , which is determined by the correlation of @xmath21 diagonal in replicas @xmath105 and the translational order correlation function @xmath106 @xmath107 in the gaussian theory that will be considered below , the two correlation functions are simply related by @xmath108    the hamiltonian ( [ cardyos ] ) can be applied directly to study quantum models with a time dependent disorder .",
    "a more physical disorder for quantum systems would be only space dependent .",
    "this would correspond to correlated disorder in one ( the `` time '' ) direction for the classical system and can be studied by the same method than the one used in this paper @xcite . for completeness",
    "we also give here in appendix  [ quantuma ] the connection between the quantum mechanics of interacting bosons and fermions and an elastic system in @xmath7 dimensions .      before starting the full calculation ,",
    "let us estimate the effects of the different terms in ( [ couplage ] ) in a way similar to ref . .",
    "in the presence of many weak pins , @xmath21 can not distort to take advantage of each of them , due to the cost in elastic energy .",
    "one can assume that @xmath21 varies of @xmath109 over a length @xmath38 .",
    "the density of kinetic energy is @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is an elastic constant .",
    "the various fourier components of the disorder will give different contributions .",
    "the long wavelength part of the disorder gives @xmath112 for the higher fourier components the disorder term @xmath113 can be estimated over the volume @xmath114 as @xmath115 .",
    "this sum can be viewed as a random walk in the complex plane @xcite and the value of @xmath21 adjusts itself to match the phase of the random potential .",
    "therefore the gain in energy density due to the disorder term is of order @xmath116 optimizing the gain in potential energy gain versus the cost in elastic energy determines @xmath37 .",
    "one can therefore associate to each fourier component a length scale above which the corresponding disorder will be relevant and destroy the perfect lattice @xmath117 the @xmath118 component of the disorder is relevant only for @xmath119 and the second term in ( [ cardyos ] ) can be dropped for @xmath120 if one is interested in the asymptotic regime .",
    "in fact , the @xmath118 part of the disorder can be eliminated exactly from ( [ cardyos ] ) and leads only to trivial redefinitions of the correlation functions .",
    "one can perform a translation of the longitudinal displacement field @xmath21 by @xmath121 where the fourier transform of @xmath122 is @xmath123 the translation ( [ translat ] ) when performed on the replicated form ( [ cardyos ] ) eliminates the long wavelength term but does leave the cosine term invariant since it is a local transformation .",
    "note that such a transformation is only possible due to the fact that the various fourier components of the disorder are uncorrelated .",
    "the mean squared relative displacement @xmath9 becomes @xmath124 as expected the additional term produces only a subdominant finite correction above two dimensions . in the following we simply set @xmath125 .    as is obvious from ( [ leslong ] ) , higher fourier components @xmath126 disorder the lattice below @xmath30 .",
    "we will now examine the effect of these fourier components more quantitatively .",
    "we now study the hamiltonian ( [ cardyos ] ) using the variational method introduced by mezard and parisi @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians with more realistic elastic energy terms , directly relevant for experimental systems , will be considered in sections ( [ degal3 ] ) and ( [ degal2 ] ) .",
    "we now look for the best trial gaussian hamiltonian @xmath127 in replica space which approximates ( [ cardyos ] ) .",
    "it has the general form @xcite : @xmath128 where the @xmath129_{ab}(q)$ ] is a @xmath70 by @xmath70 matrix of variational parameters . without loss of generality",
    ", the matrix @xmath130 can be chosen of the form @xmath131 where the self energy @xmath132 is simply a matrix of constants .",
    "the connected part is defined as @xmath133 .",
    "we obtain by minimization of the variational free energy @xmath134 the saddle point equations : @xmath135 where @xmath46 is the number of components of @xmath21 .",
    "one defines @xmath136 ^ 2 \\rangle   \\\\              & = &   t \\int { d^dq \\over { ( 2\\pi)}^d } ( g_{aa}(q ) + g_{bb}(q ) - 2 \\cos(qx ) g_{ab}(q ) ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the connected part is unchanged by disorder , a direct consequence of the statistical symmetry of ( [ cardyos ] ) noted above .",
    "two general classes of solutions can exist for ( [ bebe ] ) .",
    "one preserves the symmetry of permutations of replica , and amounts to mimic the distribution ( thermal and over disorder ) of each displacement mode @xmath137 by a simple gaussian . the other class , which is a better approximation in the glassy phase , breaks replica symmetry and approximates the distribution of displacements by a hierarchical superposition of gaussians centered at different points in space @xcite .",
    "each gaussian at the lowest level of the hierarchy corresponds to a different metastable `` pinned '' position of the manifold .",
    "let us first examine the replica symmetric solution @xmath138 and @xmath139 . using ( [ bebete ] ) one",
    "has @xmath140 for @xmath141 , @xmath142 is infinite , and the off - diagonal part of @xmath132 is zero .",
    "the @xmath143 fourier components of the disorder do not contribute .",
    "this solution turns out to be the correct solution for @xmath144 , as shown in appendix  [ stab ] .",
    "this can be explained physically by the fact that for @xmath145 , thermal fluctuations are strong enough to disorder the system .    for @xmath146 ,",
    "@xmath147 is given by @xmath148 @xmath36 is the lindemann length and measure the strength of thermal fluctuations .",

    ", the relative displacement correlation function grows as @xmath152 the replica symmetric solution is therefore equivalent at large distances to the larkin result based on a model of independent random forces acting on each vortex . as explained in the introduction this solution does not contain the right physics to describe the long distance behavior . in this variational approach",
    "this shows by the fact that the replica symmetric solution is unstable towards replica symmetry breaking for @xmath1 .",
    "this can be checked from the eigenvalue @xmath153 of the replicon mode @xcite .",
    "@xmath154 a negative eigenvalue @xmath153 indicates an instability of the replica symmetric solution .",
    "we introduce a small regularizing mass in @xmath155 : @xmath156 and take the limit @xmath157 .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ replicon ] ) that for @xmath145 the replica symmetric solution is always stable ( see also appendix  [ stab ] ) . in that case disorder",
    "is in fact irrelevant , due to the strong thermal fluctuations .",
    "for @xmath31 the condition becomes @xmath158 for small @xmath159 .",
    "thus there is a transition at @xmath160 between a replica symmetric stable high temperature phase where disorder is irrelevant and a low temperature ( glassy ) phase where the symmetric saddle point is unstable .",
    "we will examine the physics in @xmath31 in details in section  [ degal2 ] .",
    "for @xmath1 the replica symmetric solution is _ always unstable _ and disorder is therefore always relevant .",
    "since for @xmath161 , the replica symmetric solution is unstable , to obtain the correct physics one has to look for a replica symmetry broken solution .",
    "we will focus here on the case @xmath1 , the @xmath31 case being discussed in section  [ degal2 ] .",
    "following @xcite we denote @xmath162 , similarly @xmath163 , and parametrize @xmath164 by @xmath165 where @xmath166 , and @xmath167 by @xmath168 .",
    "physically , @xmath169 parametrises pairs of low lying states , in the hierarchy of states , as described in @xcite @xmath170 corresponding to states further apart .",
    "the saddle point equations become : @xmath171 where @xmath172 @xmath173 corresponds physically to the mean squared relative displacement between the position of the same vortex ( @xmath174 ) when the manifold is in two different low lying metastable states .",
    "the large distance behaviour of disorder - averaged correlators will be determined by the small @xmath169 behaviour of @xmath173 ,    as we will show in section  [ crosso ] , to discuss the large distance behavior @xmath175 it is enough to keep the smallest reciprocal lattice vectors with @xmath176 in ( [ saddle ] ) since @xmath177 .",

    "[ figure4 ] , the ratio @xmath411 increases from one at short distances and saturates at a finite value at large distances .",

    "the fact that @xmath413 saturates at large distance is a consequence of the existence of the quasi - order .",
    "had a random manifold or a larkin regime been valid up to large distances , this ratio would increase indefinitely . on the other hand",
    "if the system was genuinely ordered @xmath413 would saturate at a much smaller value than @xmath414 , a value which would go to one when @xmath221 . as is discussed in more details in section  [ experiments ] , this should have observable experimental consequences",

    "the elastic manifold sees a smooth potential with well defined derivatives , thus a local random force can be defined . indeed expanding in @xmath21 the disorder potential energy in ( [ disorder ] )",

    "but such that @xmath426 each flux line explores only its immediate vicinity and feels different disorder .",
    "this is the regime explored by bmy which is identical to the random manifold .",
    "this can be seen , on a more mathematical level , from our model by summing over all the harmonics for instance on the replicated hamiltonian ( [ cardyos ] ) .",
    "one gets @xmath427 . for @xmath428",
    "only the @xmath429 term contributes and each line sees an independent random potential .",
    "this intermediate random manifold regime holds up to the length @xmath430 such that @xmath431 at which periodicity becomes important .",
    "there is no gain in energy to shift the lattice by @xmath32 . in this regime",
    "displacements grow much more slowly and only the lowest harmonics contribute .",
    "this is the quasi ordered regime .    in order to apply this theory to experimental systems",
    "one has in principle to worry about topological defects , such as dislocations .",
    "although the influence of dislocations is still a controversial question , their influence has been clearly overestimated in the past .",
    "let us mention some arguments , which we believe are incorrect , put forward to argue that unbound dislocations will proliferate even at weak disorder .",
    "an imry ma type argument is the following .",
    "the core energy cost of a dislocation can not be avoided and scales as @xmath432 .",
    "a dislocation loop of size @xmath40 creates extra - displacements of order o(1 ) up to logarithms , in a region of size @xmath433 . by adjusting the position of the loop one can hope to gain an energy from disorder @xmath434 .",
    "thus below @xmath30 dislocation will be favorable .",
    "such an argument is incorrect because it is again based on larkin random force model for which disorder energy is linear in the displacement . for the real model the energy varies as @xmath435 and adding a dislocation displacement will not necessarily gain enough disorder energy .",
    "in fact if the larkin or the random manifold regime were true up to infinite scales it would indeed be favorable to create dislocations .",
    "the energy fluctuations due to disorder is @xmath436 . if @xmath437 dislocations will occur because it will always be energetically favorable to replace an elastic distortion by a dislocation @xcite .",
    "however in the case of a lattice or if quasi long range order is preserved in the system as it is the case here , both energies scale the same way , since @xmath438 , maybe up to logarithms .",
    "the prefactor of the disorder term can then be made arbitrarily small at weak disorder while the core energy of the dislocation is a given finite number .",
    "thus if disorder is weak enough it is likely that dislocations will not appear .",
    "even if they do the scale will be huge , and the effects associated with disorder that we discuss in this paper should be observable over a wide range of distances .",
    "if disorder is gaussian one could also argue that rare fluctuations will eventually lead to dislocations at exponentially large scale .",
    "realistic disorder however is bounded and thus such effect should be absent .",
    "let us now discuss in more details the experimental consequences of our findings .",
    "two main types of experiments exist at the moment to probe the translational order of the vortex lattice : magnetic decoration experiments and neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "one would expect for these two experiments that the results of sections  [ theory ] and  [ discussion ] apply .",
    "however , the direct comparison with experiments could be complicated due to the effects of the non - local elasticity and 3d anisotropy .",
    "these effects can be included , in principle , in the variational calculations by simply changing the elastic hamiltonian , at the price of extremely tedious calculations .",
    "even if a detailed treatment of such effects is beyond the scope of this paper , their importance can be estimated by the following simple arguments .    in the high - tc abrikosov lattice ,",
    "the elastic constants vary by orders of magnitude when the wave - vector goes from @xmath439 to @xmath440 .",
    "a good approximation of the elastic modulii for @xmath441 is @xcite @xmath442 where @xmath153 is the london penetration depth in the @xmath443 plane , @xmath444 along the @xmath111 axis with @xmath445 and @xmath446 is the single flux line contribution to the tilt modulus .",
    "one must have also @xmath447 to avoid further effects of decoupling between planes , where @xmath49 is the distance between @xmath448 planes .",
    "since in this regime @xmath449 is dispersionless and much smaller than @xmath450 , most of the effects of non local elasticity comes from the @xmath451 momentum dependence of @xmath452 . in the region of fourier space where @xmath452 varies strongly ,",
    "i.e for @xmath453 a good approximation to @xmath452 is @xmath454 this new momentum dependence of @xmath452 will lead to very different lattice displacements . using ( [ relation ] ) with the proper @xmath455 ( [ proper ] ) , one finds now @xmath186(v)\\sim v/\\log^2(v)$ ] .",
    "this leads , using ( [ btildedef ] ) , to a very slow growth of the relative displacements , @xmath456\\rangle)^2 } \\propto \\log(x)$ ] or constant , for @xmath457 . if the translational correlation length @xmath458 , the random manifold regime will survive , whereas if @xmath459 one would expect the non local elasticity effects to dominate the random manifold regime .",
    "note however that the asymptotic large distance regime , for @xmath458 will be completely unchanged .    in decoration experiments",
    "however , one is usually in a regime of very small fields .",
    "in particular @xmath460 ( bulk ) , giving @xmath461 .",
    "for example , in the bell experiments @xcite performed on @xmath462 thick samples of bscco , one has @xmath463 and @xmath464 . the highest field picture ( 69 gauss )",
    "have very large regions free of dislocations , for which one can hope to apply the theory of the present paper . for such fields @xmath465 , and thus @xmath466 .",
    "it is likely , since the interactions between vortices are less important than in the regime @xmath467 , that single vortex contributions will dominate .",
    "thus the @xmath343 dependence of @xmath452 will be weaker , and one can hope non local elasticity to be unimportant .",
    "recently , we have carefully reanalysed @xcite the data of ref.@xcite , performing a delaunay triangulation of the larger field images which do not contain dislocations .",
    "this allows to compute @xmath468 directly .",
    "preliminary results indicate a very good fit to a power law behaviour @xmath469 from @xmath470 up to @xmath471 with an exponent @xmath472 .",
    "thus , assuming dispersionless elastic constants , this is a strong indication that one is seeing the random manifold regime .",
    "the exact exponent @xmath473 for the random manifold regime is unknown , but the ( flory ) value @xmath474 predicted by the variational method is expected @xcite to be a ( relatively good ) _",
    "lower bound_. another prediction @xcite for the exponent using refined scaling arguments , which might turn out to be more accurate , is @xmath475 , i.e @xmath476 for @xmath6 and @xmath52 .",
    "the data exclude a larkin type behaviour @xmath477 , and in fact there seems to be no measurable larkin regime for small @xmath370 , indicating that @xmath289 .",
    "one does clearly observe a saturation in @xmath468 around @xmath478 at a value of @xmath468 consistent with the predicted saturation to the slower logarithmic growth .",
    "however larger pictures would be necessary to conclude unambiguously on the crossover itself , as well as the large distance regime .",
    "the main obstacle is of a statistical nature , i.e there are not enough pairs of points uncorrelated statistically , to perform the necessary translational average .",
    "larger pictures would allow such an average to be taken .",
    "clearly both the understanding of the short distance regime , and of the importance or not of non local elasticity , and the existence of the quasi ordered regime deserve further studies . other difficulties in interpreting data from decorations experiments can come from the fact that surface interactions may be different from the bulk ones @xcite .",
    "it has been argued recently however that the effects of the surface interactions may be visible only at scales much larger than the size of the decoration pictures @xcite .",
    "another good probe of the correlations in the vortex lattice , which is free of potential surface problems , is the neutron scattering experiments .",
    "detailed neutron diffraction studies are now available for different type ii superconductors , such as nbse@xmath479 ( see reference  ) as well as bscco .",
    "neutron experiments measure ( up to a form factor taking into account the field distribution created by a single vortex line ) the fourier transform at @xmath480 of the density correlation around a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath13 . the structure factor which is measured is given by @xmath481 where @xmath482 is given in ( [ lesb ] [ resdebut ] [ simibani ] [ resfin ] ) .",
    "the full calculation of @xmath483 requires a numerical integration of ( [ neutrons ] ) , but the main features can be given analytically .",

    "@xmath489 a clear signature that one is indeed in the regime ( [ divergence ] ) described here should show in the neutron experiments by the fact that @xmath483 has no true half - width .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath483 will be limited either by the experimental resolution of by the distance between unpaired dislocations @xmath41 .",
    "varying these parameters should leave the rest of the curve nearly unchanged ( this is valid as long as @xmath490 ) . the distance between dislocations",
    "could be controlled by annealing the lattice , either using a driving force or a field - cooling procedure similarly to what is done in ref . .",

    "however since this variable does not feed back at any order in perturbation theory ( only averages of the type @xmath577 with @xmath578 appear ) it has been assumed that this fixed point was correct .    using",
    "the rg one can again define a short and large distance regime . at short distances",
    "the rg is certainly correct , and is more accurate than the variational method since it treats the fluctuations correctly . as was noted in section  [ singlecos ] , at short scales @xmath34 such that @xmath579 ( for the single cosine model ) , it is possible to expand the cosine to equivalently recover the larkin random force model .",
    "the correlation function for that model reads simply @xmath580 this usually leads to @xmath581 , but here one must take into account renormalization by thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is done by integrating the rg equation in the small distance regime where we note that ( [ rg1 ] ) is correct as long as @xmath582 , which is equivalent to @xmath583 .",

    "there are also corrections coming from the renormalization of @xmath572 . integrating ( [ rg2 ] )",
    "one gets @xmath589 but such corrections are obviously smaller at short distances .    at large distance @xmath590 , in order to obtain the correlation functions ,",
    "one has to assume that the unusual co fixed point is indeed correct .",
    "if one does so , correlation functions can be computed @xcite using rg flow equation ( [ rgflow ] ) .",
    "iterating until @xmath591 such that @xmath512 allows to obtain for large @xmath208 : @xmath592 which leads to @xmath593 . in ( [ rgflowbis ] ) it has been assumed that simple perturbation theory could be done for the correlation functions at scale @xmath594 .",
    "the rg approach would therefore predict a @xmath595 growth of the displacements . at variance with the predictions of the variational method which gives a simple log .",
    "in fact the rg results is based on the assumption of replica symmetry . as we have shown recently@xcite , a careful analysis of the cardy ostlund fixed point and of the rg flow shows that it is unstable to replica symmetry breaking .",
    "when rsb is allowed one obtains a runaway flow of the rg which is consistent with the findings of the variational method .",
    "two recent numerical calculations on this model @xcite seem to confirm that the gvm does describe the correct physics at large distance .",
    "none of them is compatible with a @xmath595 growth of the displacements . in ref .",

    "a careful comparison was performed with the predictions of the rg calculations , and the results were found incompatible .",
    "these numerical results are however consistent with the prediction of the variational method .",
    "indeed for such weak disorder the length @xmath550 is very large , especially near @xmath43 , and simulations performed on a too small system will show no deviations as is obvious from ( [ asyb ] ) .",
    "however in ref .",
    "the disorder is much larger , and @xmath596 is of the order of the lattice spacing @xmath32 .",
    "this simulation indeed shows quite clearly a freeze of the amplitude of the logarithm below @xmath43 at the value @xmath597 .",
    "elastic models in two dimensions have been studied for some time .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ cardyos ] ) describes several physical disordered systems , such as randomly pinned flux arrays in a plane @xcite , the surface of crystals with quenched bulk or substrate disorder @xcite , planar josephson junctions @xcite , domain walls in incommensurate solids .",
    "in addition , a very nice realization , investigated in detail recently , is provided by magnetic bubbles @xcite . in such systems",
    "one should be able to test the predictions of the previous section .",
    "however , if the elastic objects are not lines ( @xmath7 ) but points ( @xmath10 ) it is now important a priori to take into account the effects of free dislocations . in two dimensions , dislocations are expected to be much more important than in three dimensional systems , and to have observable consequences on the destruction of translational and/or orientational order . a very naive argument in @xmath31",
    "is that while the energy of a dislocation pair of separation @xmath370 increases as @xmath599 in the absence of disorder ( a slowly growing function but still allowing for a quasi - solid phase for @xmath600 ) , in the presence of disorder , the energy should saturate to a finite value @xmath601 when @xmath602 .",
    "this is because long range order is supposed to be destroyed beyond this length , effectively screening the elastic pair interaction .",
    "if it is the case , unpaired dislocations will be thermally excited at any finite temperature with weight @xmath603 .",
    "note that the same type of argument in @xmath6 excludes dislocation loops of size @xmath370 whose energy scale as @xmath604 and thus can not proliferate so easily .",
    "this was discussed in section  [ discussion ] .    as was discussed in section  [ theoryd2 ] , in the absence of dislocations quasi - long range order",
    "persists in the system even in the presence of disorder , and the above naive arguments need to be reexamined . a quantitative theory including both disorder and dislocations is difficult .",
    "one can however get an idea of the effects of dislocations by using the renormalization equations of cardy and ostlund in the presence of topological defects @xcite .",
    "these equations were derived by cardy and ostlund for a one component field ( xy model ) with both disorder ( random field ) and vortices .",
    "they correspond to the modification of ( [ rg1 ] ) and ( [ rg2 ] ) to include the dislocation fugacity , and an additional equation for the renormalization of the dislocation fugacity itself @xcite .",
    "generalizing them to a triangular lattice beyond linear order goes beyond the scope of this paper , but we do not expect radically new conclusions , rather a change by a small factor of the parameters ( temperature , etc .. ) ( note that extension to a @xmath605 components on a square lattice is obvious ) .",
    "there are several reasons why we believe that the co equations might _ overestimate _ the effect of dislocations .",
    "one is that , as we saw before ( [ theoryd2 ] ) these rg equations implicitely assume replica symmetry .",
    "they lead to a faster decay of the translational correlation function in the absence of dislocations , of the type @xmath606 and thus overestimate the effect of disorder compared to the gvm , which includes replica symmetry breaking .",
    "the gvm predicts that quasi long range order exists in the system .",
    "thus the co equations should also overestimate the effects of dislocations .",
    "a stability diagram can be constructed by examining the renormalization equations to linear order , for the fugacity of topological defects and for the disorder , in the system considered by cardy and ostlund @xcite the fugacity of vortices @xmath294 satisfies to lowest order in y : @xmath607 while the @xmath17 component of the disorder @xmath29 renormalizes to linear order as : @xmath608    the influence of _ internal _ disorder on a two dimensional crystal was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    "the disorder was taken as a quenched random stress coupling to the strain , i.e a term @xmath609 was added to the hamiltonian with @xmath610 . as discussed in [ derivation ] this corresponds to include only the _ long wavelength _",
    "part of the disorder , and to neglect the @xmath17 component of the disorder , which is very important for the present problem of _ substrate _ disorder . for the 2d elastic triangular lattice the fugacity of dislocations @xmath294 renormalizes , to linear order , in a way very similar to [ fugacity1 ] : @xmath611 one easily sees that , to linear order , the @xmath17 disorder renormalizes also very similarly to [ fugacity2 ] @xmath612    the stability diagram is shown in figure  [ figdis ] .",
    "in presence of dislocations there are thus various possible regimes .",
    "there are two critical temperatures .",
    "one is the kthny melting temperature @xmath613 , above which dislocations unbind for the pure system which melt into a hexatic .",
    "the other one is the glass transition temperature @xmath614 , below which disorder becomes relevant in the absence of dislocations .",
    "the ratio between these temperatures is equal to half of the exponent @xmath615 of the pure system at @xmath616 . for the co model",
    "it is thus universal and equal to @xmath617 . for the triangular lattice it depends on the ( renormalized ) elastic constants @xcite but can not exceed @xmath618 . in figure  [ figdis ]",
    "we have shown schematically how @xmath294 and @xmath619 are renormalized , at linear order as a function of temperature and long wavelength disorder @xmath572 from [ fugacity3 ] [ fugacity4 ] . at high temperature dislocations",
    "are relevant and disorder is washed away by thermal fluctuations .",
    "below @xmath620 disorder becomes relevant leading , in the absence of dislocations , to the cardy - ostlund line of fixed points .",
    "this line however is _ unstable _ to dislocations . in the shaded region in figure  [ figdis ] ,",
    "the dislocations would be perturbatively irrelevant for the system with @xmath621 and the solid would survive ( in fact in that case if one includes non linearities in @xmath294 the solid is stable in an even greater region @xcite ) .",
    "however in this region the disorder @xmath619 is relevant .",
    "it will eventually increase @xmath572 as can be seen from ( [ rg2 ] ) , and drive the flow towards the region where @xmath294 itself increases and unpaired dislocations will eventually appear at large scale .",
    "let us now estimate at which scale dislocations will appear , assuming weak disorder .",
    "the disorder @xmath621 becomes of order one at lengthscale of order @xmath37 .",
    "the key point is that up to this lengthscale the fugacity of dislocation has been renormalized _ downwards _ and is now much smaller with @xmath622 . at this lengthscale ,",
    "one ends up with a system for which the disorder is of order one and the fugacity of dislocations is extremely small .",
    "one can therefore predict that the typical distance between unpaired dislocation @xmath41 in the shaded region is much larger than @xmath37 , the distance above which effects of disorder manifest and ( [ asyb ] ) can be observed .",
    "it is impossible to compute rigorously the ratio @xmath623 using perturbative rg since beyond @xmath37 one of the coupling constant ( @xmath29 ) is large , but one can still estimate this ratio by the following heuristic argument . if one assumes that , when @xmath29 has become of order one , ( [ rg2 ] ) is still valid , then above length of order @xmath37 , @xmath624 where @xmath625 , is a coefficient of order one . then estimating the distance between dislocations as the scale at which @xmath294 becomes of order one , one gets using [ fugacity1 ] @xmath626 where @xmath573 is a constant of order unity and @xmath627 the bare value of the dislocation fugacity .",
    "the resulting prediction is that in the shaded region of figure  [ figdis ] dislocations appear only at scales large compared to @xmath37 , and the main reason for decay of translational correlations is the pinning of the elastic manifold .",
    "thus the elastic theory developped in this paper should apply up to distances up to order @xmath41 . in that low temperature region",
    "perturbative rg does not allow to obtain precisely the correlation functions even at not too large distance since one is far from the perturbative region @xmath628 .",
    "the variational method on the other hand predicts the following results : as shown in appendix  [ random2 ] , there is a crossover temperature @xmath629 . for temperatures",
    "@xmath630 there is no intermediate random manifold regime and the displacement correlation function should show the logarithmic growth of ( [ asyb ] ) .",
    "however since the disordered solid regime corresponds to @xmath631 , one is likely to be in the regime @xmath632 . in that case",
    "there is a random manifold regime at short distances where the displacement correlation function grows as @xmath633 . at large distance one",
    "recovers the logarithmic asymptotic regime . the anisotropy ratio between the longitudinal and transverse displacements @xmath634 should crossover from @xmath635 in the random manifold regime to @xmath229 in the asymptotic regime .",
    "experimentally , in the system of magnetic bubbles @xcite some regimes are found indeed where the distance between dislocations @xmath41 is of the order of up to five times the translational correlation length .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite observe a crossover between a regime where @xmath636 to a regime where @xmath490 , which probably corresponds to the transition to the shaded region discussed above . indeed , the measured ratio @xmath623 keeps increasing with density and is limited there only by experimental setting",
    ". it would be very interesting to increase the range experimentally accessible . in ref .",
    "some comparison with the random manifold result was also performed .",
    "however the definition of the anisotropy ratio used in ref .",
    "( @xmath637 ) does not seem appropriate , since the data were first fitted to a simple lorentzian shape .",
    "new insight in the physics of such disordered 2d systems could be gained by a reanalysis of these data .",
    "more theoretical work is also needed since the above analysis of the dislocations is very crude .",
    "it has been generally assumed that the non perturbative rg flow in presence of dislocations was towards a kind of hexatic , but nothing is really known on this phase . in particular , in the cardy - ostlund approach ,",
    "the vortices are supposed to be completely thermalized and to see only a uniform potential , and feel no effect of the disorder .",
    "this is physically incorrect , since in a disordered system the fugacity will also depend on the position .",
    "one should therefore take also into account terms which will pin the vortices .",
    "this is another reason why we believe that the co analysis overestimates the effect of topological defects .",
    "to conclude , @xmath31 elastic disordered systems have therefore a very rich behavior .",
    "many other experimental systems could be investigated , among them colloids @xcite and thin superconductors .",
    "a realization which would exclude dislocations could be to adsorb a polymerized membrane , with very high dislocation core energy , on a disordered substrate .",
    "in this paper we have developed a quantitative description of the static properties of a lattice in presence of weak disorder .",
    "we have derived a model ( [ cardyos ] ) valid in the elastic limit @xmath638 which contains the proper physics at all lengthscales , and allows to describe the various regimes as function of distance .",
    "we have applied the gaussian variational method ( gvm ) to this model and computed the correlation functions of the relative displacements .",
    "this method has the advantage of being applicable in any dimension .",
    "the comparison with the renormalization group study that we have also performed , which is possible in @xmath42 and in @xmath31 , indicates that the gvm is an accurate variational ansatz for this problem .",
    "it also shows that the gvm should be a good tool to explore other disordered problems where different length scales are present .",
    "contrary to previous studies the present analysis includes both the effect of metastable states and of the intrinsic periodicity of the lattice , both effects being found to be very important .",
    "we found that the effect of impurities on the translational order of the lattice is weaker than was previously thought and that quasi - long range order persists at large scales .",
    "the resulting phase , which we call a `` bragg glass '' has both the properties of being a glass and of being quasi - ordered .",
    "the analogy with the quasi - order which subsist at low temperature in pure two dimensional solids is puzzling .",
    "the bragg glass possess several intrinsic length scales . at very short",
    "scales it behaves as predicted by larkin s random force model",
    ". this regime should be quite limited in @xmath6 at low temperature and for a potential rough at scales smaller than the lattice . in @xmath31 however , thermal effects being stronger , this regime is wider . at intermediate scales , and low temperature in @xmath31 ,",
    "the system behaves as a random manifold of flux lines independently pinned by impurities with stretched exponential decay of translational order . at distances larger than @xmath37 ,",
    "we have shown that due to the periodicity of the lattice , the pinning by impurities becomes less effective and quasi order survives .",
    "we have not attempted to include explicitly topological defects in the present quantitative study .",
    "however , we have given evidence both in @xmath6 and @xmath31 that for weak impurity disorder the effects of dislocations is less important than is usually believed .",
    "this is due to the fact that quasi - long range order subsists even in the presence of disorder for the elastic system . in @xmath31 it",
    "is possible , but by no means established , that unpaired dislocations will appear at large scale .",
    "we have estimated conservatively the length scale at which this happens and found that it can be much larger than @xmath37 .",
    "thus in @xmath31 there is a regime where the decay of translational order is due primarily to the elastic displacements induced by disorder . in @xmath6 , we have argued that there is probably a phase _ without unpaired dislocations _ for weak disorder and at low temperature .",
    "thus in the three - dimensional high temperature superconductors there could be generically be ( at least ) _ two _ types of glass phases caused by point impurities , i.e two types of vortex glasses .",
    "the first one is the strong disorder vortex glass phase which is described by the gauge glass type of models @xcite and presumably contains a lot of dislocations .",
    "the second one is the quasi - ordered bragg glass described in the present paper .",
    "a natural speculation then is that the tricritical point recently observed in experiments @xcite , whose position in the @xmath639 plane can be raised by adding more point impurities in a controlled fashion @xcite , has something to do with the relevance of dislocations .",
    "it could mark the separation between these two phases since it is natural that the quasi - ordered glass melts through a sharper transition @xcite , much like a pure solid , while the vortex glass transition of ref .",
    "@xcite is believed to be continuous .",
    "@xcite in fact , it is not even clear whether , strictly speaking , the strongly disordered vortex glass phase of ref .",
    "@xcite is a true thermodynamic phase , rather than a very long crossover from the flux liquid .",
    "indeed recent simulations indicate that @xmath6 could be slightly below its the lower critical dimension @xcite .",
    "the bragg glass , on the other hand , should not suffer from such existential problems .",
    "the results of the present study suggest some comments concerning experiments .",
    "first decoration experiments should be reanalyzed .",
    "clearly a fit to a simple exponential as inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite is certainly inadequate for pictures where no dislocation is present .",
    "since we predict that the crossover to the asymptotic quasi - ordered regime occurs when the correlation function @xmath16 is of order @xmath640 this crossover should be observable , in principle .",
    "one must keep in mind that abrikosov lattices might not be the ideal system to compare with the theory , since they are very complicated objects with additional intrinsic scales .",
    "in particular the effect of nonlocal elasticity , 2d to 3d crossover effects and surface interactions , although they can in principle be incorporated into the method , complicate the analysis by introducing new crossover lengths such as the london length",
    ". it would be therefore highly desirable , in order to test the above predictions to investigate simpler elastic systems .",
    "one example are colloids which have been very successful to investigate translational order in pure systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , these experiments could help decide whether dislocations are a thermodynamic property of the state or simply a non equilibrium feature which can be eliminated .",
    "neutron diffraction experiments could also help decide on these issues .",
    "we obtained several characteristic predictions for neutron diffraction , such as the existence of algebraically diverging bragg peaks and predictions for the ratio of transverse to longitudinal scattering intensities .",
    "we have addressed here only the statics of a lattice in presence of disorder , the quantities of interest in that case being mainly related to positional order",
    ". it would be clearly very interesting to obtain information on the _ dynamics _ and especially the driven dynamics of such systems .",
    "this is indeed particularly important for superconductors where most experiments measure only dynamical quantities .",
    "several remarks are in order",
    ".    there exist presently a qualitative approach to the dynamics of the vortex glass based mostly on scaling arguments for energy barriers @xcite .",
    "on such a qualitative level one usually assumes a single scale for the energy landscape , i.e that barriers @xmath641 scale with the same exponent @xmath642 which describes energy fluctuations in the statics . assuming that there is a regime of transport where plastic deformations can be neglected , i.e that energy barriers are controlled only by elastic motion , the present study of the statics can be used to describe the creep regime at low temperature .",
    "the argument goes that in presence of an applied external force @xmath122 , such as the lorentz force created by an external current @xmath643 , the barrier for an optimal deformation @xmath644 away from a low energy configuration on a scale @xmath40 is lowered and becomes @xmath645 .",
    "to unpin locally the manifold thus needs to go over an arrhenius barrier @xmath646 with @xmath647 .",
    "this , and the exponents found here lead to a non linear voltage - current relation @xmath648 $ ] in the flux creep regime , where @xmath159 crosses over from @xmath649 to @xmath650 as @xmath651 decreases .    on a more fundamental level one anticipates that the methods used here for the statics and the results they yielded will set the ground for the study of the dynamics .",
    "as was discovered recently @xcite the hierarchical structure of states which is encoded in the replica symmetry breaking solution of the statics finds an exact translation in the dynamics .",
    "there it corresponds to the existence of a long time dynamics for which the fluctuation dissipation theorem breaks down and non equal time correlation and response functions become highly non trivial .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize these studies to the flux lattice .",
    "let us finally note that the quantities computed here using the statics are equal time disorder - averages and they will coincide with the observed translational averages in a given experiment provided equilibrium has been reached , which will always hold below a certain length scale .",

    "indeed this @xmath743 term comes from @xmath757 this term measures the smooth change in local density due to the slowly varying displacement field , and keeping only this term amounts to neglect the discreteness of the vortices in the original hamiltonian .",
