    "q0142 - 100 ( um 673 ) , discovered by @xcite , was classified as a gravitational lens system for the first time by @xcite .",
    "this double quasar shows two identical images ( @xmath2 ) separated by 2.2 arcsecs with the lensing galaxy ( @xmath3 ) placed among them ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , see figure 1 .",
    "the specially propitious configuration of q0142 - 100 , with large separation between both images , and their magnitudes ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) make this system adequate for a photometric monitoring from a medium - sized telescope .",
    "moreover , a predicted time delay of only some months should have turned q0142 - 100 a very attractive target for time delay determinations .",
    "however , the difficulties coming from a lensing galaxy placed very close to the b , fainter , component , the low variations in magnitude of the light curves of both components and the large annual gaps in the monitoring make strongly difficult the calculation of the time delay . from teide observatory , for example , reasonably close to the equator , q0142 - 100 can be observed about 250 days per year but this becomes in a 210 - 220 days window each year when the mechanical limits of the telescope are considered .",
    "this gravitational lens has been monitored since its discovery without very effective results .",
    "@xcite observed it in the @xmath6 band from 1987 to 1993 but their observations were of modest quality , concluding that no significant variability was seen at the quasar .",
    "some years later , @xcite presented 29 @xmath7 band observations taken from 1995 to 2000 , detecting variations of 0.2 mag in their data and a global variation of @xmath8 mag since the system was discovered .",
    "@xcite performed two - band , @xmath9 ( 23 points ) and @xmath10 ( 18 points ) , photometry during three years , october 1998 to december 2001 .",
    "unfortunately , they were unable to measure the time delay due to the small variations in magnitude of the light curves , but found possible evidence for microlensing : component a , the brighter component , became bluer as it got brighter .",
    "microlensing should be achromatic but for the inner parts of compact accretion disks the size of the emitting region varies with wavelength and hence the microlensing magnification depends on the wavelength ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite results point to a microlensing of the compact accretion disk : the central , bluer , part of the source is more amplified than the outer , redder parts .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained an estimate of the time delay between both components of q0142 - 100 from observations made in the @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 bands during the 2003 - 2005 period .",
    "these authors used a telescope placed at the maidanak observatory , and they were able to observe this lens only 3 months each year .",
    "they claimed that the time delay between a and b components of q0142 - 100 is of about 150 days , with component b following the brightness variations of component a. to obtain this value the observations at different bands are combined and then they interpolate up to 120 days to fill on the large gaps in which q0142 - 100 can not be observed .",
    "finally , @xcite mix these data with archival data from the maidanak observatory , additional maidanak observations and 2008 - 2010 ctio data .",
    "their new database covers the period 2001 - 2010 , ten observational seasons , and leads them to a new and lower value for the time delay : @xmath12 days ( 68 and 95% confidence intervals ) , with @xmath13 days as the most probable result .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the photometric follow - up of q0142 - 100 made with the iac80 telescope during more than ten years .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , one of the longest monitoring ever made of a gravitational lens system and comparable , of course in a lower scale , to what lsst will do .",
    "this monitoring includes 105 valid sessions of observation in the @xmath7 band , and has been done within the gravitational lens programme carried out at the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
    "the observations and reduction processes are presented in section 2 , and the time delay determination is given in section 3 . a search for microlensing events",
    "is depicted in section 4 .",
    "finally , a discussion appears in section 5 .",
    "a lens monitoring was performed during twelve years , 1999 to 2010 , using the 82 cm iac80 telescope at the instituto de astrofsica de canarias teide observatory ( tenerife , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "two different ccd were used . from 1999 to 2005",
    "a thomson 1024 x 1024 chip was employed , giving a field of view of about 7@xmath145 , with a pixel size of 0@xmath1543 . since 2005",
    "a new ccd , camelot , was installed .",
    "camelot hosts a e2v 2048 x 2048 chip with 0@xmath15304 pixels , corresponding to a 10.4 x 10.4 arcmin@xmath16 fov . a standard _",
    "r _ broadband filter was always used for the observations , fairly closely to the landolt system @xcite .",
    "the final data set comprises 105 points , each of them corresponding to several 900s exposures .",
    "a remarkable characteristic of the photometric data presented here is their high degree of homogeneity ; they were obtained using the same telescope and filter over the entire monitoring campaign .",
    "therefore , the reduction process can be the same for all the frames . in a first step ,",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures included in iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility , see http://www.noao.edu for more information ) _ ccdred _ package .",
    "we consider two main sources of error in our observations :    1 .",
    "* on the one hand we take into account extinction errors : * the main part of the variability of the observed target magnitude is explained in terms of atmospheric extinction and air - mass variability .",
    "extinction errors are complicated by color terms when broad multi - band photometry is dealt with .",
    "* on the other hand we consider aperture photometry errors : * due to the configuration of q0142 - 100 system , there are some specific aperture photometry errors to take into account . as demonstrated in @xcite , these errors are driven by seeing variations , and can be separated in two parts as follows .",
    "i ) influence of the lens galaxy : since the core of the lens galaxy is very close to the b image , most of the galaxy s light lies inside the image b aperture , but outside the image a aperture .",
    "ii ) overlapping of images .",
    "the separation between the two images is @xmath17 and hence , when poor seeing conditions prevail , there is an important effect of cross - contamination of light between the two quasar images .    for extinction errors ,",
    "the best and traditional method to work with is to measure differential photometry with several field stars close to the lens components @xcite .",
    "five stars in the vicinity of q0142 - 100 -defined as 1,2,3,4 and 5 in @xcite- are used .",
    "these stars were examined differentially in sets of 4 versus one star .",
    "this allowed us to establish the stability of each comparison star .",
    "after careful analysis , only two stars -1 and 3 for 1999 - 2005 , 1 and 2 for 2007 - 2010- were selected as comparison stars for differential photometry .",
    "photometric errors were calculated using the statistical error analysis developed by @xcite , which uses the rms of the differential photometry of comparison stars ( 1 - 3 or 1 - 2 in our case ) to deduce the photometric errors of lens components a and b. figure 2 shows the differential r magnitude for comparison stars .",
    "the final results are in good concordance with the values obtained by @xcite , who gave @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the solution for aperture photometry errors presents a higher level of difficulty .",
    "although the two quasar images appear separated in the individual frames , the lensing galaxy is too faint to be detected ( @xmath7 = 19.35 ) , and therefore its light it is not considered in the final model fitting .",
    "accurate photometry was obtained by simultaneously fitting a stellar two - dimensional profile on each lens component by means of psf profiles derived from bright field stars ( 1,3,4,5 stars in the 1999 - 2005 data , and 1,2,3,4 stars in 2007 - 2010 data ) .",
    "the automated pho2com iraf task , described in @xcite , was used . in order to check the feasibility of the pho2com method r magnitude and errors for both components",
    "are plotted versus fwhm in figures 4,5,6 and 7 . as demonstrated in @xcite , aperture photometry errors ( mainly due to the influence of the lens galaxy and an overlapping of the lens component images )",
    "are driven by seeing variations .",
    "no seeing dependences are detected in the photometric error ( or magnitudes ) , as can be seen in figures 6 and 7 ( and 4 & 5 ) , which means that aperture errors are minimized .",
    "on the other hand it is also useful to show the final field obtained as a combination of all the individual subtracted images for 2007 - 2010 data . as shown in figure 3 , whereas the lens components are eliminated ( the residuals of component a are of around 0.01% of the original flux ) some galaxy light remains , an additional proof that the pho2com method works well .",
    "finally , the apparent magnitudes of the a and b components were derived by comparing the instrumental fluxes with the star labelled as 1 ( see @xcite ) in both datasets .",
    "the results are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the average magnitudes of the a and b components are 16.42 and 18.42 , with a standard deviation of 0.19 and 0.23 , respectively , for the 1999 - 2005 data , whereas for 2007 - 2010 the results are 16.51 and 18.50 for a and b magnitudes , with errors of 0.06 and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "the mean difference in magnitude among both components , @xmath20 , is 2.00 for the two datasets .",
    "for the 1999 - 2005 data , the photometric errors ( derived using the 1 and 3 field stars ) of the a component data are of the order of 0.02 mag , while those of the b component are around 0.2 mag ( see figure 6 ) . on the other hand , for the 2007 - 2010 data the use of the new ccd , with a different pixel size and closer comparison stars ( 1 and 2 ) , allows to improve the error bars of both components , 0.05 and 0.007 mag for b and a , respectively ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the result of the monitoring program is shown in figure 8 , where the light curves for component a ( black ) and b ( red ) in the @xmath7 band are presented .",
    "to extract useful information from the light curves of the components of a gravitational lens system is required a high degree of photometric accuracy .",
    "however , q0142 - 100 is a quite difficult system to analyse , and not only due to its very complicated configuration , with the underlying lensing galaxy close to the faintest component .",
    "additional general drawbacks are the small variation in magnitude of the light curves during the whole period and , in our particular case , the large errors in the magnitude of component b when the iac80 s old ccd was used , the two large gaps in the data and the relatively small amount of data points obtained in some of the observational seasons . on the other hand , the system can be observed during 210 - 220 days each year from the teide observatory , much longer than from other observatories , which seems enough for time delay calculations given the value obtained by @xcite    each of our observational seasons covered several months of data , from the shortest last campaign of 53 days to a maximum of 201 days in the second one , with five seasons covering more than 125 days .",
    "on the other hand , the inter - seasons gaps -besides of the two large ones- are in the 150 - 240 days interval .",
    "these two facts mean that our database allow the detection of a large range of possible time delays , between 10 and 250 days .",
    "the dataset presents two main gaps ( see figure 8) : tjd-2935 to tjd-3985 and tjd-4677 to tjd-5305 , so three different natural subsets can be selected , in which the average mags are : @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath26 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the average mags for the whole dataset are : @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 .    prior to calculate the time delay , data must be checked to remove possible strong and simultaneous ( not time - shifted ) variations of data points in both components .",
    "these points probably originated from failures in the ccd or bad weather conditions , and their inclusion leads to artificial features in the light curves and so to wrong time delay determinations . to avoid this",
    "we have eliminated the points with a simultaneous difference in magnitude in both components larger than 2.5 times their error bar as compared with the previous and following records .",
    "this has been applied to those points with a difference in their observation dates of less than 10 days .",
    "only 3 of the 105 initial points had to be removed .",
    "there are several `` classical ways '' of obtaining the time delay between the components of a variable quasar from discrete , unevenly sampled temporary series : discrete correlation function @xcite , dispersion spectra @xcite , linear interpolation @xcite , z - transformed discrete correlation function @xcite , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein for a brief depiction of all these methods ) . in this paper",
    "we will use the @xmath0 method @xcite to calculate the time delay of q0142 - 100 , as it offers very good results even with large gaps @xcite and small variations in the flux of the components .",
    "this method makes use of the similarity between the discrete autocorrelation function ( dac ) of the light curve of one of the components ( a , for example ) and the a - b discrete cross - correlation function ( dcf ) .",
    "this second order technique helps to improve the estimation of the time delay , as was stated in @xcite , where a comparison of the results obtained with several statistical methods is made .",
    "@xcite demonstrate , with simulated and real data coming from different telescopes , that the @xmath0 method offers the best results without interpolating data even when large gaps are present .",
    "the light curves of both components of a gravitationally lensed quasar have the same origin , and so the same shape , which guarantees the fulfilment of the relationship dcf(@xmath36 ) @xmath37 dac(@xmath38 ) , of course when no strong microlensing masks the qso s intrinsic variability . from the dac and dcf functions",
    "one can define a function , @xmath39 ^ 2 \\ , , \\ ] ] for every fixed value @xmath40 ( days ) , with @xmath41 when both the dcf and dac are defined at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the most probable value of the time delay will correspond to the minimum of this function .    to calculate the dac and the dcf functions the procedure described in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) was used .",
    "for two discrete data sets , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the dcf is defined as : @xmath46 averaging over the @xmath47 pairs for which @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the bin semi - size and the measurement error associated with the dataset @xmath51 , respectively , while @xmath52 is its standard deviation .",
    "this equation straightforwardly leads to the expression for the dac .",
    "our first test to calculate the time delay from our data consisted in checking that in fact it is the b component light curve which follows component a. for this , we applied the @xmath0 method to the whole dataset , with @xmath53 days , taking into account both possibilities : a follows b and b follows a. in both cases a time delay between 10 and 250 days was considered and the a component data were selected for the dac calculations due to the lower error bars in the photometry .",
    "no clear pattern for the time delay was found when the component a delayed option was chosen , and the results of the @xmath0-test when component b follows component a were 30 times better .",
    "then , under the assumption that component b follows component a , the application of the @xmath0-test to the dac and dcc curves appears in figure 9 ( normalized to its minimum value ) , where the minimum of the curve appears at 72 days , corresponding to the best delay .    to calculate the uncertainty in our estimate of the time delay we used a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "a random number generator added a variable to each point of the dataset giving a modified value inside the range of its observational errors ( see @xcite ) , thereby obtaining standard bootstrap samples .",
    "the @xmath0-test was then applied to the bootstrap samples to get the time delay .",
    "this process was repeated 10000 times , a number large enough for the results to be treated statistically .",
    "the use of this monte carlo algorithm , again for delays between 10 and 250 days , gives a complicated distribution of values , as it is multimodal .",
    "the results of the monte carlo procedure are shown in figure 10 , in which the number of times that each time delay is obtained for the whole dataset is plotted",
    ". a sharp peak appears , corresponding to a time delay of 72 days , with a 68% ( @xmath54 ) of the iterations giving a time delay in the interval 50 - 94 days .",
    "then , we will consider a value of 72@xmath5522 days for the most probable time delay .    as was explained in previous sections ,",
    "our database allows the study of time delays between 10 and 250 days .",
    "none of our results clearly favours the 150 days obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , our time delay estimate , @xmath56 days , does agree within uncertainties with the time delay derived by @xcite , @xmath12 days , and even more with their most probable value of @xmath13 days .",
    "the light curves of the a ( black ) and b ( red ) images are represented again in figure 11 , this time delaying the b data in 72 days and shifting them by @xmath572.00 magnitudes , the result of @xmath58 . as can be seen ,",
    "both curves follow a similar trend , mainly for the last set of data where the error bars of component b are lower .",
    "however , when these curves are inspected in more detail it seems that , between roughly half of the second observational season , tjd-2800 , and the end of the third season , tjd-4039 , component b delayed and shifted data are systematically fainter than component a data .",
    "this effect is better observed when the data corresponding to each season are grouped and averaged .",
    "the second season , the one with more observations and when this difference seems to start , is divided into two .",
    "the results appear in table 1 . while the values for most of the seasons ( 1 , 2-first half and 4 - 9 ) are quite homogeneous , the second half of season 2 and season 3 are significantly different .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 for these one and half seasons and @xmath571.99 for the rest of the data set .",
    "this is represented in figure 12 . in the upper panel",
    "the seasonal averaged data are displayed , black points for the a component and blue and red points for the b component and @xmath60-mag shifted b component , respectively .",
    "notice the coincidence of the black and red points except for these one and half season .",
    "the average data are shown in the lower panel , with the dashed line representing @xmath571.99 .",
    "the variation in the difference of the average magnitude of both components during @xmath611200 days suggests the presence of a possible microlensing event , with our observations corresponding to the entrance and exit of the event .",
    "although the season 3 points for component a do not overlap in time with the shifted season 3 points for component b and the discrepancy could also be caused by a decrease in the intrinsic flux of the quasar , it seems that microlensing is indeed the most possible explanation for this behaviour .",
    "unfortunately , we lack data for most of this period and hence further evidence of this event can not be obtained .",
    "the result of a photometric follow - up of the gravitational lens system q0142 - 100 in the @xmath7 band is presented in this paper .",
    "the observations , taken with the 82 cm iac-80 telescope , at teide observatory , spain , were made from 1999 to 2010 , with 105 points obtained , as part of an on - going lens monitoring program .",
    "a calculation of the time delay between both components by using the @xmath0-test has been performed .",
    "the resulting delay is of 72@xmath5522 days , very different from that obtained by @xcite but within the errorbar of a later result given by @xcite , @xmath12 days ( 68 and 95% confidence intervals ) and @xmath13 days as their most probable result .",
    "@xcite select four models to fit several gravitational lens systems , among which is q0142 - 100 : i ) a dark matter model ( sie ) , ii ) a model based on photometric fits ( constant @xmath62 ) , iii ) dark matter model in an external shear field ( sie + @xmath63 ) , iv ) photometric model in an external shear field ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "however , neither an @xmath62 nor a sie model are good solutions for q0142 - 100 . in the first case , a poor fit to the image positions and magnifications",
    "is obtained , whilst a great degree of misalignment relative to the luminosity is required to obtain a good fit for the sie model .",
    "both models improve their results when an external shear of @xmath65 is added , but this shear does not correspond to any shear estimate for the nearby galaxies .",
    "the time delays predicted by @xcite for q0142 - 100 for the four different models are , given as @xmath66 : sie = 80.1@xmath550.3 , sie + @xmath63 = 84 - 87 , m / l = 121.3 , and m / l + @xmath63 = 115@xmath553 .",
    "all of them are larger than the time delay we have derived and even larger than the results given by @xcite .",
    "we have attempted to use the time delay to fit the lens models but unfortunately , given the large error bar , our current time delay estimation can not be yet used as an extra constraint to clarify the properties of the lens mass model .",
    "our estimate of the time delay and the one derived by @xcite are below the time delay predicted by the theoretical models , even taking into account the large uncertainties .",
    "this could be explained if some nearby , not detected yet ( maybe the bright galaxy just to the north of the lens system , see figures 1 and 3 ) , components of the system are missed and not included into the models .",
    "these missing components can be located either around the lens galaxy or on the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "although a more accurate value of the time delay could help to reduce the uncertainties in the model , it seems clear that finding more details on the system environment will help even more to its understanding and reconcile the values of the time delay with those of the hubble constant derived by other methods .",
    "we are especially grateful to the instituto de astrofsica de canarias support astronomer and night assistant teams for their help in the observations of most of the data appearing in this paper during the routine and service time .",
