    "the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity has been a central issue in unconventional superconductors .",
    "while the static magnetism is generally believed to compete with superconductivity , the dynamic magnetism could be the source of electron pairing .",
    "@xcite for example , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin - fluctuations are considered as the pairing glue in high-@xmath9 cuprates , iron - based superconductors , and many heavy - fermion superconductors .",
    "@xcite on another side , the ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin - fluctuations could be the origin of the superconductivity in sr@xmath10ruo@xmath3 , heavy - fermion superconductors uge@xmath10 and urhge .",
    "@xcite these af and fm spin - fluctuations usually result in superconducting gaps with nodes , such as the @xmath11-wave gap in cuprates and cecoin@xmath12 , @xcite and the @xmath13-wave gap in sr@xmath10ruo@xmath3 , @xcite but in some cases , such as the multiband iron - based superconductors , the af spin - fluctuations may give @xmath14-wave gap without nodes .",
    "@xcite    ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 is a cubic transition metal compound , in which superconductivity with @xmath15 7 k was found thirty years ago .",
    "@xcite very few studies have been done on this compound since its discovery . until recently , detailed resistivity , susceptibility , and specific heat measurements suggested that the superconductivity coexists with the fm spin - fluctuations in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite a peak - like anomaly near 30 k in resistivity was observed . below the anomaly ,",
    "the non - fermi - liquid behavior of resistivity in zero field has been attributed to the fm spin - fluctuations , and upon applying magnetic field , fermi liquid behavior is recovered .",
    "@xcite    since the fm spin - fluctuations may cause a nodal superconducting state in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 , it will be interesting to probe its superconducting gap structure .",
    "ultra - low - temperature thermal conductivity measurement is such a bulk technique .",
    "@xcite the existence of a finite residual linear term @xmath7 in zero magnetic field is an evidence for gap nodes .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath7 may further give support for a nodal superconducting state , and provide informations on the gap anisotropy , or multiple gaps .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we measure the resistivity and thermal conductivity of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 single crystals .",
    "we find that while one crystal shows a small hump in resistivity near 20 k , other two crystals show @xmath6 fermi - liquid behavior in zero field .",
    "for both single crystals with and without the resistivity anomaly , the absence of @xmath7 in zero field and the slow field dependence of @xmath8 in low fields clearly demonstrate nodeless superconductivity in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 .",
    "single crystals of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 were grown by flux method , as previously described in ref .",
    "the excessive sn flux was etched in concentrated hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) .",
    "the obtained single crystals have typical size of a few mm@xmath16 .",
    "we chose three single crystals with large flat surface , which was identified as ( 110 ) plane by x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "then the single crystals were polished and cut to a rectangular shape of typical dimensions 2.5 @xmath17 1.0 mm@xmath18 in the ( 110 ) plane , and 0.2 mm in thickness .",
    "the dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in @xmath19 = 20 oe both parallel and perpendicular to the ( 110 ) plane , using a squid ( mpms , quantum design ) .",
    "four silver wires were attached on the sample with silver paint , which were used for both resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements , with electrical and heat currents in the ( 110 ) plane .",
    "the contacts are metallic with typical resistance 50 m@xmath20 at 2 k. the thermal conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator , using a standard four - wire steady - state method with two ruo@xmath10 chip thermometers , calibrated _ in situ _ against a reference ruo@xmath10 thermometer .",
    "magnetic fields were applied perpendicular to the ( 110 ) plane . to ensure a homogeneous field distribution in the sample ,",
    "all fields were applied at temperature above @xmath9 .",
    "figure 1(a ) presents the typical dc magnetic susceptibility of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 single crystals , measured in @xmath19 = 20 oe parallel and perpendicular to the ( 110 ) plane , with zero - field cooled .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath15 6.9 k is determined from the onset of diamagnetic transition . in field perpendicular to the ( 110 ) plane , the shielding volume fractions exceeds -1 at 2 k , indicating bulk superconductivity of the sample .",
    "1(b ) plots the resistivities of samples s1 , s2 , and s3 in zero magnetic field . for all three samples ,",
    "the zero - resistivity @xmath15 7.25 k is slightly higher than that obtained from the magnetization measurements in fig .",

    "one can see that the small hump near 20 k of s1 is much less pronounced than the peak near 30 k in ref .",
    "interestingly , for s2 and s3 , the low - temperature data obey the fermi - liquid behavior @xmath6 , as indicated by the solid lines .",
    "we note that the residual resistivity @xmath21 of s1 is the highest among all three samples .",
    "if lower @xmath21 indicates higher sample quality , the resistivity anomaly may be not an intrinsic property of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 .",

    "the gap is anisotropic .",
    "if this is the case , according to bang s calculation , @xcite the gap ratio in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 should be around 1.4 or so .",

    "this suggests that the resistivity anomaly may be not intrinsic in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 .",
    "thermal conductivity results clearly demonstrate that the superconducting gap is nodeless in both crystals with and without the resistivity anomaly .",
    "this implies that the fm spin - fluctuations , if exist , may be irrelevant to the superconductivity in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 , and the conventional electron - phonon interaction should be responsible for the electron pairing .",
    "the @xmath8 shows a relatively fast increase near @xmath24 .",
