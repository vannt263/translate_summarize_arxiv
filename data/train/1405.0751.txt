    "recently , many works have appeared that consider the impact of limited or time - varying processing power on control algorithms .",
    "such problems arise naturally in cyberphysical and embedded systems where the control algorithm may be just one of many tasks being executed by the processor .",
    "thus , mcgovern and feron  @xcite considered the question of bounding the processing time that is required to solve the optimization problem in model predictive control to a specified accuracy .",
    "@xcite studied the trade - off inherent in solving the optimization problem exactly ( thus , obtaining the control input sequence more precisely ) and in solving the problem more often .",
    "event - triggered and self - triggered control , and online sampling , e.g. ,  @xcite have also been proposed as a means to ensure less demand on the processor on average by calculating the control input on demand in a non - periodic fashion .    in this note , we are interested in anytime control algorithms .",
    "such algorithms calculate a coarse control input even with limited processing resources .",
    "as more processing resources become available , the input is refined .",
    "the process can be terminated at any time by the processor .",
    "the quality of control input is thus time - varying , but no control input is obtained only rarely .",
    "various anytime algorithms for linear processors and controllers have been proposed in the literature  @xcite . for non - linear plants , we recently proposed anytime algorithms based on computing sequences of potential ( tentative ) future control values  @xcite . at the instances when more processing power is available ,",
    "a longer sequence is calculated .",
    "this provides a buffer against the time steps when the processor power is not enough to calculate an input . since the control values in the sequence",
    "are calculated by reutilising already computed values , the algorithm does not assume a priori knowledge of processor availability .",
    "however , with the exception of @xcite and @xcite , the analysis in these works largely considered the processor availability to be described by an independent and identically distributed sequence . in particular ,  @xcite had a brief discussion when the processor availability sequence is described by a ( hidden ) markov chain ; the memory arose through the concept of ` processor states ' which are not directly related to how many control values can be calculated . in the current work ,",
    "we replace this model by a more direct one , where the processor availability for the control task , and hence the number of tentative control values that can be calculated at each time step , forms a markov chain .",
    "more importantly , we provide a new analysis technique , that at least for a class of models , is less conservative than the technique in  @xcite . intuitively , the proposed technique considers the ` average ' case of processor availability to analyze a random - time drift condition , as compared to the ` worst case ' analysis in  @xcite .",
    "sufficient conditions for stochastic stability with and without the anytime control algorithm are provided and compared with the conditions in @xcite .",
