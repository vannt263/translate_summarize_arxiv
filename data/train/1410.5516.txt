    "<S> in contrast with standard scattering problems ( for the operator @xmath141 on a noncompact riemannian manifold ) , waves escape not to the spatial infinity @xmath142 , but to the fiber infinity @xmath143 , and the anisotropic spaces provide the correct regularity at the fiber infinity to make @xmath138 into a fredholm problem . </S>",
    "<S> the microlocal approach made it possible to apply the methods of scattering theory to anosov flows , resulting in :    * sharp upper bound for the number of resonances in strips  @xcite ( improving the bound of  @xcite ) ; * an essential spectral gap of optimal size  @xcite ; * band structure for resonances of contact anosov flows , including a weyl law under the pinching condition and meromorphic continuation of the gutzwiller  voros zeta function  @xcite ; * a microlocal proof of meromorphic continuation of ruelle zeta function  @xcite ( recovering the result of  @xcite ) ; * definition of resonances as limits of the eigenvalues of @xmath144 as @xmath145 , and stochastic stability of resonances  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our present work uses the microlocal method to obtain results for general open hyperbolic systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we use anisotropic sobolev spaces to control the singularities at fiber infinity and obtain @xmath6 as the restriction of the resolvent of a fredholm problem in these spaces . to show meromorphic continuation of the zeta function , we use a wavefront set condition on @xmath6 to ensure that a certain flat trace can be defined ; this trace is the continuation of @xmath146 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , compared to the anosov case studied in  @xcite , the case of open hyperbolic systems presents several additional difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the radial sets corresponding to the stable / unstable foliations are no longer sources or sinks , but rather saddle sets ( see figure  [ f : funny3d ] on page  ) ; to handle them , we prove a propagation of singularities result ( lemma  [ l : ultimate ] ) which applies to a broad class of dynamical situations .    </S>",
    "<S> we also need to capture singularities which escape from @xmath14 . to do that </S>",
    "<S> , we surround @xmath14 by a slightly larger strictly convex set and multiply @xmath16 by a boundary defining function of this set to make it vanish on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we then use complex absorbing potentials on the boundary and complex absorbing pseudodifferential operators beyond the boundary ( and near the glancing points ) to obtain a global fredholm problem for the extension of @xmath43 to a compact manifold without boundary @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally remark that the work of arnoldi  faure  weich  @xcite defined resonances for certain open hyperbolic maps , while  @xcite defined resonances for the grassmanian bundle of an anosov flow , which can be viewed as special cases of the open hyperbolic systems studied in the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> sections  [ s : dyn ] and  [ s : semi ] contain the necessary preliminary constructions ; section  [ s : dyn ] concerns hyperbolic dynamical systems and section  [ s : semi ] , microlocal and semiclassical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs of theorems  [ t : mer ] and  [ t : res - states ] are contained in section  [ s : res ] . </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ t : zeta ] and the closely related theorem  [ t : trace ] are proved in section  [ s : trace - zeta ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , section  [ s : examples ] gives several examples of open hyperbolic systems , including geodesic flows on certain complete negatively curved riemannian manifolds . </S>"
