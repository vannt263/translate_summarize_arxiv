    "in a variety of physical phenomena , the dominant dynamics occur in spherical and cylindrical geometries .",
    "examples include astrophysics ( e.g. , supernova collapse ) , nuclear explosions , inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) and cavitation - bubble dynamics . a natural approach to solving these problems",
    "is to write the governing equations in cylindrical / spherical coordinates , which can then be solved numerically using an appropriate discretization .",
    "historically , the first such numerical studies were conducted by von neumann and richtmyer @xcite in the 1940s for nuclear explosions . to treat the discontinuities in a stable fashion",
    ", they explicitly introduced artificial dissipation to the euler equations . while this method correctly captures the position of shocks and satisfies the rankine - hugoniot equations , flow features in the numerical solution , in particular discontinuities ,",
    "are smeared due to excessive dissipation .",
    "the collapse and explosion of cavitation bubbles , supernovae and icf capsules share similarities in that they are all , under ideal circumstances , spherically symmetric flows that involve material interfaces and shock waves .",
    "such flows are rarely ideal , insofar as they are prone to interfacial instabilities due to accelerations ( rayleigh - taylor @xcite ) , shocks ( richtmyer - meshkov @xcite ) , or geometry ( bell - plesset @xcite ) . when solving problems with large three - dimensional perturbations , cylindrical / spherical coordinates may not be advantageous . however , in certain problems such as sonoluminescence @xcite , the spherical symmetry assumption is remarkably valid . modeling the bubble motion with spherical symmetry can greatly reduce the computational cost . as an example , akhatov , et al .",
    "@xcite used a first - order godunov scheme to simulate liquid flow outside of a single bubble whose radius was given by the rayleigh - plesset equation .",
    "this approach assumes spherical symmetry but does not solve the equations of motion inside the bubble .    high - order accurate methods are becoming mainstream in computational fluid dynamics @xcite . however , implementation of such methods in cylindrical / spherical geometries is not trivial .",
    "several recent studies in cylindrical and spherical coordinates have focused on the lagrangian form of the equations @xcite .",
    "the euler equations in cylindrical or spherical geometry were studied by maire @xcite using a cell - centered lagrangian scheme , which ensures conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "these equations were also considered by omang et al .",
    "@xcite using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , though sph methods are generally not high - order accurate .",
    "on the other hand , solving the equations in eulerian form is not trivial , especially when trying to ensure conservation and high - order accuracy .",
    "li @xcite attempted to implement eulerian finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) schemes @xcite on cylindrical and spherical grids , but did not achieve satisfactory results in terms of accuracy and conservation .",
    "@xcite considered flux difference - splitting methods for ducts with area variation .",
    "@xcite followed a similar formulation of the equations employing a total variation diminishing method to simulate explosions in air .",
    "johnsen & colonius @xcite used cylindrical coordinates with azimuthal symmetry to simulate the collapse of an initially spherical gas bubble in shock - wave lithotripsy by solving the euler equations inside and outside the bubble using weno . de santis @xcite showed equivalence between their lagrangian finite element and finite volume schemes in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "xing and shu @xcite performed extensive studies of hyperbolic systems with source terms , which are relevant as the equations in cylindrical / spherical coordinates can be written with geometrical source terms .",
    "although one of their test cases involved radial flow in a nozzle using the quasi one - dimensional nozzle flow equations , they did not consider the general gas dynamics equations .",
    "thus , at this time , a systematic study of the euler equations in cylindrical and spherical coordinates , with respect to order of accuracy and conservation , has yet to be conducted .    in this paper , we investigate three different spatial discretizations in cylindrical / spherical coordinates with radial dependence only using finite difference weno schemes for the euler equations .",
    "in particular , we propose a new approach that is both high - order accurate and conservative . here , we are concerned with the interior scheme ; appropriate boundary approaches will be investigated in a later study .",
    "the governing equations are stated in section [ sec : numerical framework ] and the spatial discretizations are presented in section [ sec : numerical method ] . in section [ sec : numerical results ] , we test the different discretizations on smooth problems ( scalar advection equation , acoustics problem for the euler equations ) for convergence , and with shock - dominated problems ( sod shock tube and sedov point blast problems ) for conservation .",

    "subscripts denote derivatives .",
    "diffusion effects are neglected .",
    "for an ideal gas , the equation of state to close this system can be written : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the internal energy per unit volume , and @xmath12 is the specific heats ratio .",
    "other equations of state can be used , e.g. , a stiffened equation for liquids and solids .",
    "we describe three discretizations of the euler eqs . in",
    "cylindrical / spherical coordinates that differ based on the treatment of the convective terms .",
    "while the discretized form of the euler equations in cartesian coordinates is generally designed to conserve mass , momentum and energy , the conservation condition does not necessarily hold in cylindrical or spherical coordinates , depending on the numerical treatment of the equations . the criterion we use to determine discrete conservation is as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a domain ( possibly a computational cell ) .",
    "here , @xmath15 represents a conserved variable , e.g. , density , momentum per unit volume or energy per unit volume .",
    "this equation means that the total mass , momentum , and energy are constant in time provided there is no flux of these quantities through the boundaries of the domain , which is the case for the problems of interest here .",
    "a different approach to defining conservation for hyperbolic laws is the exact c - type property @xcite , which implies that the system admits a stationary solution in which nonzero flux gradients are exactly balanced by the source terms in the steady - state case .",
    "xing and shu @xcite applied weno in systems of conservation laws with source terms and considered radial flow in a nozzle using the quasi one - dimensional nozzle flow equations . in our work , we focus on the euler equations .",
