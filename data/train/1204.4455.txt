    "the elegant progression of the hubble sequence from ellipticals to spirals demonstrates that galaxy morphology can be described in large part based on the relative importance of spheroid and disk subcomponents .",
    "while it is now clear that the simple evolutionary path from elliptical  early - type \" to disk - dominated  late - type \" galaxies that @xcite originally proposed is incorrect , the physical origin of the hubble sequence and the formation of and relationship between the different structural subcomponents remain subjects of vigorous research .",
    "the central spheroids of spiral galaxies fall into two categories , which can be explained by distinct formation mechanisms as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "classical bulges , which are typically described as elliptical galaxy analogs with random stellar velocity distributions , large velocity dispersions , and @xmath10 de vaucouleurs surface brightness profiles , are likely formed through violent merger / accretion events .",
    "pseudobulges , which are more flattened , have more ordered kinematics , and have roughly exponential brightness cutoffs ( or , more generally , srsic profiles with low @xmath11 values ) are likely formed through secular heating of the disk .",
    "more detailed observations , yielding constraints on the structure and dynamics of bulges , will lead to a clearer understanding of possible formation scenarios .",
    "any study of the inner regions of a galaxy is complicated by the presence of several spatially overlapping structural subcomponents , such as the disk , spheroid , and halo .",
    "deconvolving these subcomponents to reveal the behavior of a single one is difficult .",
    "traditionally , codes such as galfit @xcite or gim2d @xcite are employed to fit galactic integrated light profiles with the sum of a srsic bulge and exponential disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique is the only possible method for characterizing the structure of distant galaxies , but it suffers from strong assumptions about the characteristic light profiles of bulges and disks . in addition , degeneracy in the best - fit derived parameters can cloud interpretation of the results .    resolved stellar kinematics offer a complementary approach to structural deconvolution of the nearest galaxies . instead of assuming specific surface brightness profiles of disks and spheroids",
    ", one must only make the geometrical argument that a stable disk  a thin , flat structure  is kinematically colder ( has a higher @xmath12 ) than a stable spheroid .",
    "separate components can then be identified and characterized by their distinct stellar velocity distributions .",
    "the proximity of andromeda ( m31 ) at about 785 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) renders it the only large spiral galaxy other than the milky way ( mw ) where detailed photometric _ and _ kinematical observations are possible with current observing facilities .",
    "we use resolved stellar kinematics to study m31 s kinematically hot `` inner spheroid '' at projected radii of 220 kpc .",
    "any description of this region  or that in the the intermediate region of any large galaxy  is necessarily complex ; the literature is full of vocabulary such as `` bulge , '' `` spheroid , '' `` inner spheroid , '' `` outer spheroid , '' `` disk , '' `` thin disk , '' `` thick disk , '' `` extended disk , '' and so on .",
    "there is not yet a consensus on the best combination of these nouns to represent m31 .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we use the word `` spheroid '' to describe a kinematically hot component : some combination of bulge , halo , and/or any other spheroidal component .",
    "likewise , we refer to the kinematically colder population as the `` disk , '' where this term includes any distinct disk components that may be present , such as the thin , thick or extended disks .    despite the possibility of multiple components ,",
    "the disk is likely to be locally kinematically cold .",
    "@xcite claim that m31 s stellar disk at @xmath131040  kpc consists of a cold thin disk and a warm thick disk , as is the case for the mw .",
    "given that most of our fields are closer to m31 s center than the innermost field of @xcite , and given their finding that the thin disk has twice the density of the thick disk and a shorter radial scale length , we expect the cold thin disk to dominate the stellar disk population in our fields .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggest that no more than about 10% of the total disk luminosity may be due to an extended disk component which also lags the cold disk .",
    "though we do not know a priori the relative contributions of the thin , thick and extended disks , in ",
    "[ ssec_cold ] we show that our assumption of a dominant thin component is justified for the purposes of measuring the kinematical parameters of the inner spheroid .",
    "unlike the case of its stellar disk , m31 s inner spheroid has no analog in the mw and is therefore of great interest .",
    "the spheroidal system at these radii in the mw is relatively metal - poor ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is composed entirely of old stars , and has a power - law spatial density profile of the form @xmath15 , which corresponds to an @xmath16 power - law surface brightness profile .",
    "models such as those proposed by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the mw halo represents a population of accreted dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the inner spheroid in m31 more closely resembles a bulge than a halo .",
    "it is more metal - enhanced than the mw halo , with [ fe / h ] @xmath17 @xcite , and has a srsic surface brightness profile with @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the stellar population of m31 s spheroid is younger than that of the mw inner halo on average , with @xmath19 of the stars younger than @xmath20 gyr @xcite , and the stellar density is also significantly higher than that at an equivalent location in the mw @xcite .",
    "the inner spheroid straddles territory between two well - studied components of the spheroid : the classical and boxy bulges interior to @xmath21 @xcite , and the outer halo which dominates past @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the central kpc , where the density is too high for resolved stellar population spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite analyzed integrated - light kinematics to reveal a bulge rotation speed of @xmath23 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath24 at @xmath25 on the major axis .",
    "however , they cautioned that this measurement is contaminated by the kinematically cold disk which may contribute nearly a third of the light at this radius .    farther out in m31 s halo , kinematical surveys of the resolved stellar population using the keck / deimos multiobject spectrograph have mapped the cold substructure , as well as the underlying smooth virialized population , out to @xmath26  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled kinematics of @xmath27 red giant branch ( rgb ) halo stars in scattered fields between @xmath288 and 70  kpc . using a windowing technique to eliminate stars whose velocities were consistent with that of the disk , they found that the velocity dispersion of the remaining population decreased radially outwards : @xmath29 .",
    "subsequently , as part of the spectroscopic and panchromatic landscape of andromeda s stellar halo ( splash ) survey , @xcite fit a double gaussian profile to the velocity distribution of rgb stars in a large contiguous region along the southeastern minor axis of the galaxy and measured a constant velocity dispersion of @xmath30 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "in recent years , the focus of splash has migrated inwards , first to target the dwarf galaxies andromeda i and andromeda x @xcite , ngc  205 @xcite and m32 @xcite , and now towards the disk- and bulge - dominated inner regions of m31 .",
    "the majority of the data analyzed in the present paper come from the most crowded area targeted to date : a large contiguous disk - dominated area on the ne major axis with @xmath3319  kpc .",
    "this area was selected to overlap the coverage of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ) survey , a five - year hubble space telescope ( hst ) multicycle treasury ( mct ) program that began in 2010 @xcite .",
    "the disk and spheroid share the inner regions of the galaxy with remnants of tidally disrupted galaxies .",
    "the dominant features in star - count maps of the 220  kpc region are the giant southern stream ( gss ; the remnant of a tidally stripped satellite galaxy ) and the shelves ( sharp edges in stellar density ) created by it @xcite .",
    "both the gss and a `` secondary stream , '' which is cospatial with the gss but separated by @xmath34 in velocity , have been kinematically detected in multiple fields south of m31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified the northern extension of the stream in the @xcite and @xcite sample of rgbs and in the planetary nebulae of @xcite .",
    "there are two principal challenges to a resolved stellar population kinematical study of the crowded inner spheroid of m31 .",
    "first , we must select intended stellar targets whose spectra are least likely to be contaminated by close ( in projection ) stellar neighbors .",
    "second , we must disentangle the stellar disk from the spheroid population we wish to characterize .",
    "this is especially important in disk - dominated fields , where fewer than @xmath35 of the stars may belong to the spheroid .",
    "note that though a large part of this paper will focus on accounting for the disk contribution , our analysis method is designed to elucidate the nature of the inner spheroid rather than the disk .",
    "we do not attempt to make a statement here about the rotation curve of the stellar disk or the presence of a thick disk .",
    "we plan to analyze these components in a future paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec_observations ] we explain our target selection techniques , spectroscopic observations and radial velocity extraction . in ",
    "[ sec_analysis ] we describe our method for isolating and characterizing the spheroid velocity distribution in each of five spatial bins . in  [ sec_results ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results ; finally , we summarize our findings in  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "our data set for this project is a compilation of three sets of rgb spectra , two of which are presented here for the first time .",
    "a detailed technical description of the spectroscopic slitmask design and data reduction is given in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we describe the target selection criteria for the different data sets and give an overview of the data acquisition and reduction methods common to all the observations .    in  [ ssec_data ] , we outline the three data sets used in this paper . in  [ ssec_catalogs ] , we describe the source catalogs from which we select our spectroscopic targets . in  [ ssec_target ] , we explain our target selection criteria . in ",
    "[ ssec_multi ] , we provide the observing details . in  [ ssec_mreduce ]",
    ", we give a rundown of the data reduction process . in  [ ssec_cc ] and  [ ssec_quality ] , we measure velocities of individual stars and determine the quality of those measurements , respectively .",
    "finally , in  [ ssec_serendip ] , we discuss the detection and velocity measurement of serendipitously detected stars .      the spatial coverage of our three data sets is shown in figure  [ fig_galex ] .",
    "each rectangular outline represents a keck / deimos slitmask , which covers approximately @xmath36 and yields 200270 useful spectra .",
    "( the actual footprint of a deimos slitmask is not perfectly rectangular . )",
    "the se data sets consists of three slitmasks oriented along the eastern minor axis of m31 ( violet in figure  [ fig_galex ] ) .",
    "the m32 data set includes the five slitmasks covering the compact elliptical galaxy m32 directly south of m31 and one slitmask on the sw major axis ( blue in figure  [ fig_galex ] ) .",
    "the se and m32 data sets were observed during the 2007 and 2008 fall seasons .",
    "our newest data set , from october 2010 , covers a portion of m31 s northeastern major axis spanning the projected radial range @xmath37@xmath38 or 219  kpc from the center of m31 in the plane of the disk ( red and black in figure  [ fig_galex ] ) .",
    "five of these 15 slitmasks ( black ) were chosen to maximally overlap the regions of existing photometry from the first year of the phat program .",
    "the pre - imaging and reduction processes are identical for all three data sets .",
    "the primary difference in data acquisition is in the target selection : isolated sources are hand - selected for the se and m32 slitmasks from a single monochromatic ground - based source catalog @xcite , while we use an automated series of statistical techniques as well as limited color information from the phat survey to choose targets for the mct slitmasks .",

    "we select a bright limit of @xmath57 because the tip of the red giant branch is at @xmath58 in m31 and so the mw contamination fraction increases significantly in brighter stars .",
    "the faint - end limit is chosen because in very crowded areas , it is difficult to recover high - quality spectra of stars fainter than about @xmath59 .",
    "the surface density of sources in the area covered by the mct slitmasks is so high that we can efficiently pack targets on our slitmasks even with a conservative faint - end limit of @xmath60 .    to choose targets for all slitmasks , we first sort possible targets into three lists ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) in decreasing order of isolation , with list 3 reserved for rejects (  [ sss_secrowd ]   [ sss_mctblend ] ) . within each list , we prioritize possible targets by magnitude , giving highest priority to intermediate - brightness stars with @xmath61 . in the final target selection process",

    "each target is flagged as unblended , marginally blended , or badly blended depending on the degree to which its image resembles the psf on the high - pass filtered image and the strength of systematic residuals at its location on the residual image .",
    "based on our experience with the m32 and se spectroscopic data sets , we decide to use a slightly relaxed crowding criterion for the mct data set , rejecting ( assigning to list 3 ) any catalog entry with at least one neighbor which satisfies the following :    @xmath66    this change accounts for the fact that the seeing during our spectroscopic observations tends to be slightly better than the @xmath45 cfht seeing upon which the original criterion was based .",
    "this cut eliminates @xmath67 of the stars in the inner slitmasks , @xmath68 at intermediate radii , and only @xmath19 in the furthest slitmask , mcte3 .      in order to avoid a tedious visual inspection of the large area covered by the mct data set , we design two empirically - based statistical tests to detect possible blends . we visually inspect and flag as `` blended '' or `` non - blended '' @xmath69 objects in each of three small representative image sections at different distances from the center of m31",
    "we then design quantitative tests that approximately reproduce our visual classifications .",
    "the first test is based on the daophot - generated goodness - of - fit parameter chi and shape parameter sharp .",
    "objects that appear isolated based on visual inspection fall into a well - defined locus in chi / sharp space , as shown in figure  [ fig_chisharp ] .",
    "based on this relationship , we retain only objects with sharp @xmath70 .",
    "we assign a radially dependent linear cut in chi , accepting all stars with chi @xmath71 in the crowded areas and progressing to the more stringent criterion chi @xmath70 in the least crowded outermost slitmask .",
    "this cut eliminates @xmath35 of the remaining candidate targets .",
    "because the dividing line between isolated sources and likely blends is less well defined in chi than sharp , we allow a buffer zone @xmath72 units wide in chi .",
    "the @xmath73 of stars in the buffer zone are relegated to list 2 , but not rejected outright .    in the second test for possible blends ,",
    "we compare the apparent quality of subtraction to the normalized rms flux of a @xmath74 pixel square of the psf - subtracted image centered on the source .",
    "this value tends to increase with apparent degree of blending .",
    "we determine that the best cut is a linear function of magnitude , where blended sources have @xmath75 at @xmath57 and @xmath76 at @xmath60 ( figure  [ fig_rms ] ) .",
    "the 36% of stars that fail this test are flagged as `` possibly isolated '' and pushed to list  2 . because the correlation between apparent psf subtraction quality and rms is not as tight as those in the chi / sharp test",
    ", we do not use the rms cut to reject ( assign to list  3 ) targets that are  isolated \" according to both the neighbor - rejection and chi / sharp tests .",
    "we also design five slitmasks based jointly on cfht data and the phat survey - based stellar population lists described in  [ ssec_catalogs ] .",
    "we require that a star from the phat catalog be in the cfht catalog and have passed through the filters described above to be considered for selection . to ensure final selection of the most isolated ( list 1 ) phat objects , we push all non - phat objects down one list . for these five slitmasks , then",
    ", the priority scheme is as follows : list  1 consists of only isolated , phat - selected sources ; list  2 includes the isolated cfht - only sources ; and list  3 includes all of the possibly - isolated sources .",
    "because the shape of the phat survey bricks is different from the shape of deimos slitmasks , large areas of the deimos slitmasks that overlap phat survey bricks do not target phat - based sources .",
    "in these areas , the mask design software automatically proceeds to list  2 to select cfht - based objects .      to summarize , each source passes through three tests for isolation : neighbor - rejection , chi / sharp , and rms .",
    "each source receives a score for each test : 0 if isolated , 0.6 if marginally isolated , and 2.0 if not isolated .",
    "the sum of the three scores determines which list the source belongs in . a total score of 0 maps to list 1 ; a total of less than 2.0 maps to list 2 ; and a star with a total score of 2.0 or greater is assigned to list 3 .",
    "hence , any star that fails either the neighbor - rejection or chi / sharp test can not be selected , and any star that passes all three filters is given highest priority .",
    "none of the methods described here can fully eliminate the possiblity of placing one slit over several objects . especially in the crowded inner areas , it is very common to obtain mutiple spectra in one slit .",
    "we discuss our handling of these serendipitous detections in  [ ssec_serendip ] .",
    "in addition , a small percentage of the target spectra may still be contaminated with light from nearby objects ; objects with unusable spectra are identified by eye and removed from the sample at the end of the data reduction process as described in  [ ssec_quality ] .",
    "the target selection process outlined above serves simply to make educated guesses about the objects best suited for spectroscopy .    in ",
    "[ ssec_kstest ] we show that the spectroscopic target selection criteria ( phat cmd vs. magnitude only ) and actual degree of crowding ( isolated vs. sharing a slit with another bright object ) have minimal , if any , effect on the measured velocity distribution .",
    "all slitmasks are observed using keck / deimos with the 1200 line mm@xmath77 grating .",
    "this configuration yields a spatial scale of @xmath78 pixel@xmath77 and a spectral dispersion of @xmath79   pixel@xmath77 .",

    "we use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler to find the velocity distributions of the disk and spheroid in each region .",
    "the spheroid is modeled as a single gaussian distribution for each region , while the disk is modeled as a gaussian distribution for each subregion .",

    "subregion @xmath127 includes stars from the galaxy m32 , so for that subregion only we replace the single - gaussian disk model @xmath128 with a double - gaussian model .",
    "the likelihood in equation  [ eqn : likelihood ]  can be sampled independently in each of the five regions .",
    "we use the code emcee @xcite , which implements the affine - invariant ensemble sampler of @xcite , to perform the mcmc algorithm .",
    "in addition to the likelihood above , we must specify prior probability distributions for the parameters .",

    "if we sample each region independently , then the parameter space for region @xmath122 includes @xmath123 , @xmath124 , plus the set of @xmath129 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 for each subregion @xmath121 within @xmath122 .",
    "we initialize the mcmc at @xmath131 , @xmath132 , each @xmath133 , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 = the sample mean and standard deviation of the velocities in subregion @xmath121 .",
    "briefly , the mcmc ensemble sampler works as follows .",
    "it explores the parameter space by maintaining a set of _ walkers_. each walker represents a point in the parameter space . at each iteration of the mcmc",
    ", each walker takes a step in the parameter space by choosing another walker and stepping along the line in parameter space connecting itself to the other walker .",
    "the step size is chosen stochastically and allows interpolation as well as extrapolaton . in effect , the walkers choose their steps based on the covariance of the set of walkers .",
    "after each step is taken , the posterior probability distribution at the new point in parameter space is evaluated .",
    "steps that increase the probability are always accepted , while steps that decrease the probability are _ sometimes _ accepted . after a large number of steps",
    ", the ensemble of walkers will sample the parameter space with frequency proportional to the posterior probability distribution ; we can draw fair samples from the distribution by selecting points from the histories of the walkers .",
    "we estimate the mean and variance of each parameter ( assuming unimodal distributions ) based on sample statistics of the histories of the walkers . in particular , we allow each of 32 walkers to take 10,000 steps .",
    "we then compute the mean spheroid velocity as the mean value of @xmath123 over the last 2000 steps of all the walkers ( i.e. , the mean of 64,000 points ) , and the 68% confidence interval as the standard deviation of that quantity over the last 2000 steps of all of the walkers .",
    "we use the same method to estimate the values and uncertainties of the spheroid dispersion and the disk parameters .",
    "we report these values in columns 7 and 8 of table  [ tab_results ] and illustrate them in figure  [ fig_profiles_nogss ] .",
    "the analysis described thus far separates the spheroid from the disk ( and from m32 in subregion @xmath134 ) .",
    "the mean velocity and dispersion we extract describe the average properties of the spheroid , regardless of its underlying structure .",
    "several lines of evidence , however , suggest that our measurements do not well represent a rotation curve of a smooth spheroid .",
    "first , the mean spheroid velocities in the five regions do not follow a physical rotation pattern : the mean velocity of the ne2 region is consistent with zero , while the surrounding regions ( ne1 and ne3 ) are rotating at about @xmath135 in the same direction as the disk .",
    "second , the sum of hot and cold gaussians does not well represent the velocity distributions .",
    "a chi - squared analysis applied to the data binned by @xmath136 reveals that that the probability of the model representing the velocity distribution is relatively low ( see the final column of table  [ tab_results ] ) .",
    "velocity histograms , such as those in figure  [ fig_6plots ] , suggest that cold substructure , possibly tidal debris from the gss , could be skewing our measurements .",
    "a close - up view of the negative - velocity tail of the ne2 histogram reveals a cold spike of about 10 stars in excess of the gaussian tail at @xmath137 ( figure  [ fig_6plots ] , top right ) .",
    "a slight overdensity of points at this velocity can be seen in the ne1 and ne3 histograms as well .",
    "though nothing is immediately visible in the se or ssw regions , a few extra stars around @xmath138 would be partially concealed by the bulk of the velocity distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig_v_rproj_all ] shows another projection of these data : the velocity of each star in the ne1 , ne2 , and ne3 regions plotted against @xmath139 .",
    "also shown ( in turquoise triangles ) are data from two gss fields at 17 and 21 kpc @xcite .",
    "the concentrations of stars at approximately @xmath140 and @xmath141 in these data represent the gss and the secondary stream , respectively .",
    "the magnitudes of the central stream velocities increase with decreasing @xmath139 as the streams fall into the potential well of m31 from the south .",
    "the black crosses in figure  [ fig_v_rproj_all ] show the expected stream velocity as a function of radius closer to the center of m31 @xcite .",
    "the ne region data from this work show clear concentrations of objects near the predicted stream velocity , continuing the trend seen south of the galaxy .",
    "hence , it seems unlikely that the peak in the figure  [ fig_6plots ] histograms is simply a binning artifact , and probable that it comes from the northern extension of a cold tidal stream .    to account for the presence of the gss and its associated tidal debris , we repeat the mcmc fits in regions ne1 , ne2 , ne3 , and ssw after removing all stars within @xmath142 of the predicted velocities of the two streams .",
    "( the measured velocity dispersion of the stream from @xcite is @xmath136 ; however , we use the larger value to ensure that we exclude all stream stars despite the slightly uncertain mean stream velocity . ) in the se minor axis region , we exclude all stars with velocity @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "the former is to account for gss debris , and the latter for se shelf stars ( gss debris from third pericentric passage ) @xcite .",
    "we account for the fact that we have removed stars within a range of velocities by renormalizing the gaussian distributions .",
    "that is , given a gaussian velocity distribution , we compute the fraction of the probability mass that falls within the excised velocity range and scale up the remainder of the distribution so that the integral over the remaining ( unexcised ) velocities is unity .",
    "the resulting kinematical spheroid parameters are reported in columns 7 and 8 of table  [ tab_results_gss ] .",
    "the resulting fit for region ne1 is plotted in figure  [ fig_ne1_subs ] .",
    "the first seven panels show the seven subregions in ne1 . in each panel , each walker at the end of 10,000 steps is represented by a set of colored lines : a red gaussian with parameters @xmath145 and a blue or green gaussian with parameters @xmath146 .",
    "the sum of these two is shown in violet .",
    "these distributions are overlaid on the velocity histogram of stars in the subregion .",
    "the velocity ranges excised for stream debris are shown in two ways : the velocity range is shaded in light gray , and the stars in this range are colored red .",
    "the bottom middle panel shows the cumulative best - fit distributions : the red line is the gaussian corresponding to the mean @xmath147 .",

    "we first present the rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile for the inner spheroid in  [ ssec_kin ] . in  [ ssec_cold ]",
    "we compare the velocity dispersion of the cold component to previous measurements of the stellar disk as a sanity check on our analysis method . in  [ ssec_gss_results ]",
    "we show that the exclusion of velocity ranges corresponding to tidal debris from the gss significantly impacts the measured kinematical parameters of the spheroid , but has minimal effect on the cold component . in  [ ssec_high_v ] we compute a spheroid membership probability for each star in our sample . in  [ ssec_anisotropy ]",
    "we explain that the spheroid is likely supported by velocity anisotropy in addition to rotation .",
    "finally , in  [ ssec_kstest ] we show that neither spectroscopic target selection criteria nor degree of crowding introduces a significant bias towards the kinematically cold or hot population .",
    "the spheroid distributions corresponding to the best - fit @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( hereafter @xmath151 ) are plotted in figure  [ fig_6plots ] for each of the five regions .",
    "( this figure is simply a compilation of the summary panels of figures  [ fig_ne1_subs ] and 1316 . )",
    "kinematical and goodness - of - fit parameters , accounting for the gss and associated tidal debris , are reported in table  [ tab_results_gss ] .",
    "the @xmath87 probabilities have improved significantly from the uncorrected values in table  [ tab_results ] .",
    "four of the five regions now have probabilities greater than 90% , and that of the fifth ( ssw ) has increased by a factor of 15 .",
    "the dispersion profile is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig_profiles ] .",
    "the profile appears to decrease smoothly with radius , though it is consistent with flat to @xmath8 .",
    "the best - fit line to this profile is    @xmath152    where @xmath153 is the effective spheroid major axis coordinate , assuming a 5:3 axis ratio @xcite .",
    "our dispersion profile is consistent with that measured by @xcite but is slightly offset from other existing measurements , including the @xcite integrated - light measurement at 1.1 kpc on the major axis of the bulge ( black square in figure  [ fig_profiles ] ) and the linear dispersion profile of @xcite .",
    "these differences should be taken lightly , though , because the measurements are not directly comparable . the @xcite point may be slightly deflated by contributions from the low - dispersion disk stars , which those authors estimate contribute about @xmath86 of the light in the slit . the @xcite profile , meanwhile , is the innermost limit of measurements primarily made farther out in the halo , so we do not necessarily expect agreement at the radii covered by our study .",
    "we also compare our results to the dispersion profile produced by a model with spherical , isotropic , non - rotating bulge and halo stellar components as well as a stellar disk and halo ( @xmath154 ) and bulge ( @xmath155 ) ( dotted orange line in figure  [ fig_profiles ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model falls below our data at the @xmath8 level in the ne2 and ne3 regions and at the @xmath156 level in the se and ne1 regions .",
    "the mismatch suggests that , for example , the mass profile of the model galaxy is too shallow , or the gradient of the density profile of the tracer population is too large .",
    "a more detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "extracting the intrinsic rotation curve of the spheroid is nontrivial .",
    "the relationship between the mean los velocity and the intrinsic rotation velocity depends on the orbital dynamics of the spheroid , and in general is difficult to determine without detailed 2d or 3d kinematical mapping .",
    "therefore , in the left panel of figure  [ fig_profiles ] we simply present the mean los component of the velocity versus the effective major axis coordinate ( based on a 5:3 axis ratio ) .",
    "though two points are consistent with zero to @xmath8 , we detect significant rotation in the ssw , ne1 and ne3 regions .",
    "the average value of @xmath157 , excluding the se minor axis point , is @xmath158 ( solid line in figure  [ fig_profiles ] ) .",
    "all four off - minor axis points are consistent with this mean velocity to better than @xmath159 .",
    "this is the first measurement of significant rotation in the inner spheroid .",
    "the velocity dispersion of m31 s inner spheroid is similar to that the halo of the mw at similar radii , but its mean velocity is significantly larger .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid of the mw s inner halo is @xmath160 @xcite , on the same order as the los component of the m31 spheroid dispersion .",
    "however , the mw s inner halo has a mean rotation velocity consistent with zero @xcite .",
    "the cold component @xmath161 for each subregion are plotted against @xmath96 in figure  [ fig_disk ] . as a sanity check on our analysis method of fitting multiple gaussians to subregions , we compare these values to previously measured kinematical parameters of the stellar disk . the cold component in a single subregion",
    "has an average dispersion of @xmath162 , reasonably consistent with the @xcite dispersion measurements of @xmath163 and @xmath164 for the thick and thin stellar disks , respectively .",
    "we expect our dispersion to be larger than the local value , primarily because the finite spatial extent of our subregions necessarily smears out the velocity distribution .",
    "for example , if the spread in mean velocity due to @xmath165 is @xmath166 in a subregion , and the true velocity dispersion is @xmath167 , then we would expect to measure an effective dispersion of @xmath168 this effect is accentuated if there is an additional spread in mean velocity with radius .",
    "therefore , the fact that our cold component looks like the thick disk of @xcite does not imply that the thick component dominates the stellar disk .",
    "a possible concern is that contributions from multiple stellar disk components ( a combination of thin , thick , or extended ) may invalidate our assumption of a locally cold disk .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect to see non - gaussianity in the velocity signature of the cold component .",
    "however , table  [ tab_disk ] shows that that the velocity distributions of the cold components in most of the subregions are well fit by a single gaussian .",
    "while this observation does not say anything about the kinematical structure of the disk , it does suggest that our simple assumption is adequate for our purpose of describing the spheroid .",
    "it is also possible that a kinematically warm thick disk component would be incorporated into our gaussian representation of the spheroid ; however , the high goodness - of - fit statistic again suggests that this is not a significant effect . in any case",
    ", the bias on our kinematical spheroid parameters induced by thick disk contamination confirms , rather than invalidates , our qualitative results , as discussed in ",
    "[ ssec_anisotropy ]",
    ".    a closer look at the best - fit cold and hot components by subregion in figures [ fig_ne1_subs ] and 1316 show that the trends in the cold component with position angle match those expected for an inclined rotating disk .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig_ne1_subs ] , the mean velocity of the cold component ( blue and green curves ) transitions from @xmath89 in subregion @xmath169 , along the major axis , to @xmath170 in subregion @xmath171 , farthest from the major axis .",
    "in other words , the absolute value of the offset of the mean velocity of the cold component from the systemic velocity of m31 moves closer to zero as we march away from the major axis . this progression is clear in figures  [ fig_ne2_subs ] and [ fig_ne3_subs ] for regions ne2 and ne3 as well , although it is less pronounced because these regions subtend a smaller range in pa .",
    "accounting for the gss and its associated debris has a significant effect on the measured kinematical parameters of the underlying smooth inner spheroid , supporting the observation of @xcite that the debris was visible in the samples of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the secondary stream identified by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite is present in the ne1ne3 regions .",
    "figure  [ fig_v_rproj_all ] reveals a second clump of objects in the ne2 region , offset from the primary stream by 75100@xmath172 , the same separation as that between the two streams south of the galaxy .",
    "however , such clumps are barely , if at all , visible in the ne1 and ne3 regions , and their exclusion does not significantly affect the kinematical parameters of the spheroid .",
    "further observations are necessary to determine if there is a second substructure and , if so , whether it has a physical connection to the gss .",
    "is the gss the only source of nonvirialized substructure biasing our measurements of the mean velocity and dispersion of the inner spheroid ? while we can not prove that all stars except those in the excised velocity ranges belong to either a disk or a perfectly smooth spheroid , we can show that the effect of other nonvirialized substructure on our kinematical characterization of the underlying smooth spheriod is negligible . in star - count maps of the inner regions of m31 , such as those in @xcite , the gss is by far the most prominent substructure .",
    "even so , gss stars account for only a small fraction of our spectroscopic sample ( see pink shaded regions in figure  [ fig_6plots ] ) , and have a relatively small effect on our results .",
    "other , less - prominent substructures would ( 1 ) be nearly impossible to detect and account for , and ( 2 ) have a negligible effect on the measured kinematical parameters of the inner spheroid",
    ".      we can apply our subregion fits to quantify the spheroid membership probability for any star . at the location and velocity of each star in our sample",
    ", we calculate the ratio of the values of the best - fit hot component in that region and the disk and m32 components in that subregion .",
    "the disk and m32 membership likelihoods are calculated in a similar fashion .",
    "the results are sorted into three categories as follows : stars that are at least three times as likely to be disk members as anything else ( yellow in figure  [ fig_bulge_prob ] ) ; stars at least three times as likely to be spheroid members as anything else ( magenta ) ; and other objects , including likely m32 members ( green ) .",
    "as expected , objects on the major axis are much more likely to be disk members than are those on the minor axis . most important , we see likely spheroid members at all radii covered by our sample .",
    "recently , @xcite reported discovery of an `` extreme velocity '' star at a projected radius of @xmath173 kpc ( @xmath174 ) along the sw major axis of m31 .",
    "the star has a velocity of @xmath175 , essentially excluding it from membership in the thin , cold stellar disk .",
    "those authors attribute the star s highly negative velocity to possible membership in the gss , even though it would have to be a @xmath176 outlier of the stream velocity distribution .",
    "our probability map demonstrates that this object can more easily be interpreted as a member of the spheroid , even at these large radii : it may be a @xmath177 outlier of the spheroid distribution .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this distribution of probabilities as a map of bulge - to - disk fraction .",

    "we measure @xmath186 = 0.230.52 , but @xmath187 of @xmath188 or @xmath189 would be required for rotation to flatten the spheroid to an ellipticity of @xmath190 or @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "hence , rotation alone probably does not account for all of the flattening of the spheroid .",
    "it is possible that anisotropy in the velocity ellipsoid can provide the remainder of the flattening .",
    "anisotropy can be parameterized by    @xmath191    where @xmath192 points along the axis of symmetry of the spheroid , @xmath118 is any orthogonal direction ( say , @xmath122 ) , and @xmath193 represents the pressure from velocity dispersion along direction @xmath194 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a system with an axisymmetric velocity ellipsoid , @xmath195 corresponds to a system whose flattening is unaffected by anisotropy , while @xmath196 corresponds to a system whose flattening is almost entirely due to anisotropy . using the iterative method described in @xcite , we find that an anisotropy of @xmath197  0.050.27 is required to explain a spheroid ellipticity of 0.210.4 , given the mean value of @xmath186 in regions ne1ne3 and ssw .",
    "we compare the inner spheroid of m31 to other spheroidal systems .",
    "the bulges of spiral galaxies generally fall on or above the line for rotationally - flattened systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast , so - called `` fast - rotating '' ellipticals tend to lie between this line and the line @xmath198 ( magenta in figure  [ fig_ellipticity ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , these comparison systems are observed at around one effective radius @xmath199 , whereas our kinematical measurements range from 1.514@xmath200 .",
    "the inner spheroid of m31 , then , more closely resembles the inner @xmath201 of a fast - rotating elliptical than the central bulge of a spiral galaxy .    as suggested earlier in",
    " [ ssec_cold ] , it is possible that the spheroid velocity distribution may be contaminated by thick disk stars .",
    "if so , the true spheroid mean velocity is lower than we report , and the true spheroid dispersion higher .",
    "however , note that the @xmath186 of the spheroid is already small enough to look more like an elliptical galaxy than the bulge of a spiral galaxy . the possible bias induced by a thick disk component would merely increase this effect , confirming our conclusion that m31 s inner spheroid rotates unusually slowly .",
    "the majority of our spectroscopic targets were chosen on the basis of @xmath48 magnitude only , but a small fraction of the targets in the mct region were identified based on position in the phat cmd .",
    "this latter category contains proportionally more of the rarer metal - poor and metal - intermediate rgb populations .",
    "if metal - poor and metal - intermediate rgbs preferentially trace the kinematically hot population , then inclusion of the phat - selected objects could bias our measurements , especially our spheroid membership probabilities . to test for bias",
    ", we performed a komolgorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test comparing the velocity distributions of the phat - selected targets and the magnitude - selected targets in each subregion .",
    "the test confirmed that the two distributions were indistinguishable .",
    "similarly , we used a k - s test to confirm that inclusion of crowded objects does not bias us towards one structural subcomponent .",
    "we created two lists of objects : `` crowded '' ( those sharing a slit with at least one serendipitously detected neighbor ) and `` isolated '' ( those without any such neighbors ) .",
    "again , there was no singificant difference between the velocity distributions of the two categories in any subregion .",

    "eleven stars are excluded from the mcmc fit in the ne2 region due to possible tidal debris membership ; as seen in figure  [ fig_ne2_subs ] , all are from the four subregions closest to the major axis .",
    "exclusion drastically improves the chi - squared probability that the spheroid plus disk gaussians are a good representation of the velocity distribution , raising it from 0.136 to 1.000 .",
    "exclusion also increases the mean velocity and decreases the velocity dispersion of the spheroid , bringing them much more into agreement with those measured in the other regions .",
    "several trends characterize the subregion panels .",
    "first , the fraction of stars in the spheroid ( parameterized by ratio of the areas of the red spheroid and blue / green disk curves ) increases with increasing distance from the major axis .",
    "second , the mean velocity of the cold component decreases with increasing distance from the major axis . reading off the velocity axis of the parameter - space view in the bottom right panel , we see that the mean velocity of the cold component moves from about @xmath208 to @xmath209 .",
    "the minimum velocity is less negative than that in region ne1 because region ne2 subtends a smaller range in pa .",
    "nine stars are excluded from region ne3 as possible tidal debris contaminants .",
    "exclusion slightly improves the reduced chi - squared of the fit .",
    "it also slightly increases the mean velocity of the hot component and decreases the velocity dispersion , bringing them more into agreement with those measured in the other regions .",
    "because this region is centered farthest from the center of m31 , it subtends the smallest range in pa of the three ne regions , and so the variation in cold component mean velocity between subregions is small .",
    "however , the parameter - space view in figure  [ fig_ne3_subs ] shows that the cold component kinematical parameters are very well defined .",
    "we exclude 36 stars from the tails of the velocity distribution in the se minor axis region .",
    "while this does not skew the results of the mcmc fits in one direction or another , it does serve to increase the uncertainty in the final kinematical parameters ; this effect can be seen in the large scatter in the walker positions in the parameter - space view in figure  [ fig_se_subs ] .",
    "the minor axis is a saddle point in the velocity field of m31 . here , the observed rotation velocity changes from less negative than @xmath210 on the north side to more negative than @xmath210 on the south side .",
    "the mean velocities of the cold component reflect this transition .",
    "the parameter - space view in the final panel of figure  [ fig_se_subs ] shows that in subregion @xmath211 ( blue ) , which lies parallel to and just north of the minor axis , we measure a mean velocity slightly less negative than the systemic velocity of m31 . in subregions @xmath212 ( turquoise ) and @xmath213 ( green ) ,",
    "situated south and north of the minor axis , respectively , we measure mean velocities more negative and less negative than @xmath214 .",
    "finally , we notice that the fraction of spheroid members is smallest in subregion @xmath211 , which is centered farthest from the center of the galaxy than the other two subregions .",
    "eleven stars fall into the velocity range excluded due to stream contamination in the ssw region .",
    "the exclusion does not have a significant effect on the mean velocity or dispersion of the hot component .",
    "the chi - squared probability of a good fit is lower in the ssw region than in the others , but exclusion of the possible stream stars improves the probability by a factor of about 15 .",
