    "although promising because of the possibility of generating a vast range of boundary states , the scheme described so far may be far from being realistic , in some set - ups .",
    "a unitary description is hardly retained for the whole range of time necessary in the mems - approaching mechanism when systems of quantum dots ( neutral atoms ) embedded in a cavity are considered , for instance .",
    "any realistic physical set - up will imply the consideration of a finite rate of amplitude ( phase ) damping affecting the system at hand .",
    "in particular , for the specific instance considered in this work , energy leakage outside the cavity due to finite resonator quality factor should be quantitatively included in our calculations .",
    "this is extremely important within the context of our investigation , especially in virtue of the special role played by the excitation - conservation rules highlighted above .",

    ", this means that we can neglect the backaction of the photons emitted by the qubits therefore validating the born approximation .",
    "moreover , the bad - cavity limit also allows for markovian treatment of the open dynamics as it is equivalent to a short qubit memory time . in analogy to what has been done in the unitary case , we want to trace out the field degrees of freedom , which can be systematically done by using projection - operator techniques  @xcite .",

    "although very close to the boundary , @xmath80 never touches it .",

    "we can quantify exactly how close we get to the @xmath9 class by using state fidelity @xmath87  @xcite , which gives an estimate of the similarity between two density matrices @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for identical ( orthogonal ) states , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) . here , we use the `` amplitude '' version of @xmath92 defined by @xmath93 , which is not too sensitive to very small changes in the optimal set of parameters . by comparing @xmath9 and the density matrix having elements given by eqs .",

    "@xcite , where physical or effective squeezed fields where beneficial to the task of mems s generation , one may now wonder whether coupling the cavity field to a squeezed bath can improve the performances of the protocol addressed here . in this section",
    "we briefly show that , for the specific instance here studied , this is not the case at all .    in order to provide a quantitative study to this situation , we have derived the reduced master equation for two qubits immersed in the field of a cavity coupled to a broadband squeezed - vacuum characterized by the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 related to the squeezing parameter @xmath110 ( the equality sign holding for ideal squeezing , in which case we have @xmath111 ) .",

    "( [ reduced ] ) for @xmath75 and replacing raising and lowering qubit operators with their `` squeezed '' versions @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the resulting master equation , depending explicitly on @xmath114 and the effective coupling rates @xmath115 and @xmath116 , is identical to the one obtained adapting the approach described in  @xcite which passes through the use of a squeezed and dissipative picture .",
    "for @xmath117 , the thermal cavity - field case is found back , while the case of both @xmath118 corresponds to the optimal vacuum - field situation that has been extensively discussed above .",

    "[ fig3 ] * ( b)*. these reveal that the largest fidelity is achieved at @xmath119 ( for an ideally squeezed field ) . the slower decay of fidelity in the squeezed case might be related to the protected steady state that is typically achieved when this sort of structured baths is considered .      until now we have only considered dissipation induced by losses in the cavity field due to its coupling with an external bath .",
    "this resulted in effective damping terms in the reduced two - qubit master equation .",
    "however , spoiling mechanisms intrinsic to the qubit system , such as spontaneous emission and phase - damping , may originate important effects to be taken into account .",
    "typically , these kick in with different time scales and their relative weight is a system - dependent issue .",
    "however , a few general considerations can be made here .",
    "spontaneous emission from the excited state of each qubit occurring at rate @xmath120 ( in order for the bad cavity limit to hold ) is formally accounted for by introducing in the two - qubit reduced master equation terms identical to the first line of eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) ( for @xmath75 and replacing @xmath115 with @xmath121 ) .",
    "this results in an effective modification of the spontaneous emission rate which becomes @xmath122 with @xmath123 the ( finite ) cooperativity parameter corresponding to qubit @xmath27 . depending on the relative ratios of the parameters entering the problem ,",
    "this simply biases the dynamics towards individual spontaneous emission processes of the two qubits , against the effective qubit - qubit interaction , therefore resulting in less entanglement and more mixedness of the stationary state . on the other hand , the inclusion of phase - damping processes in the dynamics encompassed by eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) needs to be commented .    as the closest state to mems occurs for @xmath124",
    ", we only need to consider this case .",
    "phase damping is added by introducing @xmath125=-\\gamma [ \\sigma_z , [ \\sigma_z , \\varrho(t ) ] ] \\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) .",
    "notice that as @xmath126 does not involve field operators , it remains unaffected by the procedure used to obtain the reduced qubit dynamics .",
    "therefore , term ( [ phasedamp ] ) is straightforwardly added to eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) where we set @xmath75 . by means of suitably modified bloch equations ,",
    "we are able to quantify the effects that phase damping has on entanglement generation . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows such effects on our optimal solution .",
    "we see that the inclusion of this term has a drastic effect on the state of closest proximity to mems . even for the very small value @xmath127",
    ", we already see a marked drop in the amount of entanglement our state possesses .    *",
    "( a ) *     in fact , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] * ( b ) * shows that by @xmath128 we have lost all the entanglement .",
    "thus , a setting realizing the discussed scheme on effective mems s approach should keep phase - damping effects under control in order to mantain the protocol efficient .",
    "this result is interesting also under another viewpoint .",
    "in fact , it can be seen that despite the excellent proximity between @xmath9 and our optimal state , the resilience properties of the two states against phase damping processes are quite different : @xmath9 as a family of states is incredibly robust to the action of phase - damping channels acting on the qubits . as shown by the dot - dashed part of the boundary curve in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] * ( a ) * , such a channel maps a state belonging to @xmath9 into another one within the same family , so that the lower part of the mems curves basically folds on itself  @xcite . on the other hand , the optimal state @xmath82 is affected in the rather different way addressed above , despite it is less than @xmath129 away , in terms of state fidelity , from such a mems .",
    "such a behavior asks for the design of suitable strategies for the protection of the proprties of @xmath82 , at the optimal point , against processes bringing it away from the mems boundary .",
    "this is currently the topic of our ongoing investigations .",
    "here , we provide some details about an experimental setting we would like to suggest as a potential candidate for the successful implementation of the scheme we have discussed so far .",
    "it is somehow obvious that a cavity - qed set - up of two neutral atoms into an optical cavity as well as single - electron - charged quantum dots into a semiconductor microcavity would be well suited for the test of our proposal .",
    "however , here we decide to explicitly approach a circuit - qed set - up , which we believe is the most promising scenario for our purposes in virtue of its properties of easy manipulability of stationary qubits and the physical features of the cavity and two - level systems involved .    in this scenario ,",
    "each qubit is encoded into a standing - still superconducting qubit embodied by a squid working in the charge regime at the degeneracy point ( to wash away , to first order in the single - cooper pair charge @xmath130 , the detrimental effect of low - frequency noise induced by background impurities )  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use the recently proposed _",
    "qubits , a charge - phase qubit that results from a modification of a cooper - pair box , which achieve umprecedented protection against @xmath131 noise .",
    "the transition energy of each superconducting qubit can be adjusted through an external , _ in situ _ magnetic flux that modulates the josephson energy of the squid  @xcite in such a way that the qubit can be easily put in the strong resonant or dispersive regime with the field .",
    "this tuning ability is at the basis of the experimentally demonstrated non - demolition measurement of the qubit state through spectroscopic resolution of the field s frequency - pulling effect  @xcite .",
    "the qubits are integrated , via conventional optical lithography , in a full - wave / half - wave on - chip coplanar waveguide split by input / output capacitances at tens of millimeters apart .",

    "this , together with the effective dipole moment of the squid qubit ( @xmath135 ) gives rise to @xmath136 .",
    "the energy damping time of the stripline can be as long as @xmath137s , which in principle allows for a long coherent dynamics within the cavity lifetime ( experimental evidences put the qubit damping rate in the range of @xmath138s ) and thus the implementation of the unitary version of the mems - approaching scheme . a detailed derivation of the qubit - stripline coupling hamiltonian and the resulting coupling strength can be found in paternostro _ et al . _",

    "we refer to that work for an extensive account of the details necessary for such the step .",
    "in this paper we have studied how dissipation can be used in a way so as to engineer a two - qubit state whose properties are fairly close to those of a mems .",
    "we found that concurrence as large as @xmath143 can be set in a state having more than @xmath144 fidelity with @xmath9 .",
    "this was achieved by introducing dissipation in a system than , in the noiseless unitary case , is able to span quite a large portion of the mems boundary .",
    "although the noise - affected version of the protocol sees a strong reduction in its ability to produce genuine mems , yet a rather considerable possibility of _ navigation _ in the @xmath45 plane is preserved , despite the explicit consideration of dissipation .",
    "the relevance of our study is thus twofold . on one hand ,",
    "it can be seen as the promising demonstration that a simple protocol for quantum state engineering of entangled mixed state can be designed for dissipation - affected settings . on the other hand ,",
    "ours is the rigorous and complete quantitative assessment of the ability of a resonant and bias spin - boson coupling to generate mems under the effects of relevant sources of noise . as such",

    "<S> is still elusive . </S>",
    "<S> such incompleteness is well evident in the current unavailabity of a unique and unambiguous entanglement measure for general states involving more than two parties and the striking difficulties related to the ordering of mixed entangled states under different entanglement measures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of paramount importance to continue the investigation along these lines . </S>",
    "<S> an important contribution to the problem represented by the trade off between entanglement and mixedness has been given by the classification of bipartite states exhibiting the maximum obtainable amount of entanglement for a given degree of mixedness  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit form of these genuinely interesting states , dubbed maximally entangled mixed states ( mems s ) , strongly depends on the chosen measure for entanglement and mixedness .    </S>",
