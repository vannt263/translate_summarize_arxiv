    "we have shown that a class of simple , discrete models of stochastic phase coupled oscillators can undergo either a subcritical or supercritical bifurcation to macroscopic synchrony , depending on the chosen form of the microscopic coupling .",
    "as such , the different instances of the model can be used to study either continuous phase transitions  @xcite or discontinuous transitions exhibiting hysteresis , a characterstic seen in detailed theoretical models of , e.g. , coupled josephson junctions  @xcite but only observed in significantly more complex coupled oscillator models  @xcite .",
    "we stress that universality suggests that all models in this class exhibiting continous phase transitions should show similar behavior near the critical point , and this served as the basis of our eariler studies  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that minor modifications in microscopic coupling can alter the nature of the bifurcation in such a fundamental way .",
    "in addition , we have shown that in dichotomously disordered populations , both subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations can occur , and the distinction is completely determined by the relative width @xmath85 characterizing the transition rate disorder between the two populations . while the qualitative features of the transitions within each class ( subcritical and supercritical ) appear identical , the distinction between classes points to fundamentally different mechanisms underlying the initial emergence of phase synchronization . in particular , it is striking that the level of disorder within a population , as measured by @xmath85 , can significantly alter the behavior near the critical point ( though we stress that behavior even moderately above threshold is qualitatively indistinguishable ) .",
    "finally , we have studied the microscopic basis of phase synchronization above threshold .",
    "it is initially counterintuitive that phase synchronization , defined in terms of the hopf bifurcation and temporal oscillations in the macroscopic variable @xmath64 ( and measured in the order parameter @xmath90 ) , is not contingent upon the existence of overlapping distributions of @xmath160 .",
    "that is , our results regarding the discrete oscillator model highlight the complexity of microscopic dynamics underlying macroscopic cooperation and point to a potentially misleading subtlety . whereas phase synchronization is often considered a stronger condition than frequency entrainment  defined using an order parameter built upon the notion that a fraction of units display identical time - averaged frequencies in the oscillator population ",
    "we here report subtle microscopic features which distinguish the two without establishing a clear hierarchy .",
    "for example , hong et al .",
    "@xcite show that for disordered populations of kuramoto oscillators , the lower critical dimension for frequency entrainment is lower than that for phase synchronization in locally coupled oscillators , indicating the relative ease with which frequency entrainment is achieved .",
    "they note that the two transitions coincide in the case of globally coupled units .",
    "contrast that with our dichotomously disordered population , for which phase synchronization occurs without any overlap in the frequency distributions : that is , no oscillator from population one has the same frequency as any oscillator from population two . while a direct comparison is not plausible owing to the specific differences between models and order parameters , we stress that any order parameter related to time - averaged measurements of frequencies would , for our model , be misleading and provide potentially counterintuitive results .",
    "the emergence of a nonzero @xmath90 , which measures phase synchronization , corresponds with the loss of stability of the asynchronous fixed point ( the hopf bifurcation ) .",
    "this does not guarantee similar distributions of time - averaged frequencies in the two populations ; in fact , we can readily see that synchronization occurs while the frequency distributions are entirely distinct .",
    "furthermore , the frequency of the macroscopic oscillations of the mean field does not always coincide with the time - averaged frequencies of the oscillators constituting the population ( or any subpopulation ) . only when coupling is sufficiently large to substantially reduce the anamolously long waiting times which bias @xmath160 will the frequency distributions begin to overlap one another and coincide with the frequency of the mean field oscillations . because these long waiting times appear more readily in the population with the smaller @xmath176 , the time - averaged frequencies of the two populations are disproportionately affected , meaning that the populations will appear to behave quite differently in terms of average frequency .",
    "this in fact underlies the stark differences in the degree of synchronization between two populations as measured by the order parameter @xmath90 , and provides an intuitive description capable of explaining this discrepancy .",
    "our previous results show that completely disordered populations show qualitative similarities with the dichotomously disordered case  @xcite ; hence , we are led to cautiously speculate that wholly disordered populations are also characterized by waiting times @xmath169 distributed with long tails , and hence time - averaged frequencies become downwardly biased , meaning that the order parameter for frequency entrainment , in the typical sense , will not accurately reflect the macroscopic cooperation .",
    "further studies along these lines are currently in progress",
    ".    finally , the results of this work raise the following question : how dependent is the above phenomenon on the choice of a discrete phase model ? would similarly counterintuitve results arise in continous phase oscillators ?",
    "in fact , a recent study by rosenblum and pikovsky  @xcite suggests that a similar ( though not identical ) state of partial synchronization arises in continous oscillators coupled in a highly nonlinear fashion .",
    "specifically , they find that in globally coupled oscillators , phases exist in which certain subpopulations are characterized by time - averaged frequencies which are not commensurate with the oscillations of the mean field , that is , they are not locked with the macroscopic oscillations induced in the population .",
    "while once again the differences between the models make direct comparison difficult , it is nevertheless clear that measurements of time - averaged frequencies provide potentially counterintuitive results , even in globally coupled arrays . in the case of our stochastic discrete oscillators ,",
    "the behvavior is quite transparent once viewed in terms of @xmath169 , though it is not clear whether a similar mechanism underlies the phenomenon in the continous phase model . uncovering the relationship between the superthreshold phase in our model and that in the continous oscillator model of  @xcite remains an open question , but",
    "even the superficial similarities between the results motivate continued efforts along these lines .",
    "this work was partially supported by the national science foundation under grant no ."
