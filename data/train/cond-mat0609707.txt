    ". these fluctuations can be equilibrium fluctuations , as encountered for example when looking at steps on surfaces , or they can be of nonequilibrium origin as it is the case in various growth processes .",
    "well known examples of nonequilibrium surface fluctuations are found in kinetic roughening or nonequilibrium growth processes @xcite as for example in thin film growth due to vapor deposition .",
    "interestingly , both equilibrium and nonequilibrium interface and surface fluctuations can be described on a mesoscopic level through rather simple langevin equations @xcite . in this approach",
    "the fast degrees of freedom are modeled by a noise term , thus yielding stochastic equations of motion for the slow degrees of freedom . in many instances",
    "the physics of dynamical processes is to a large extend captured by linearized langevin equations @xcite where one distinguishes whether the dynamics is purely diffusive or whether mass conservation has to be implemented .    for purely diffusive dynamics ( called model a dynamics in critical dynamics @xcite )",
    "the linear langevin equation can be written in the following way : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the value of the macroscopic field @xmath2 at site @xmath3 at time @xmath4 . in the physical context of fluctuating interfaces and growth processes in @xmath5 spatial dimensions",
    "@xmath2 is the height field whereas @xmath3 is the lateral position in the underlying @xmath6 dimensional substrat lattice .",
    "in addition , @xmath7 is the diffusion constant whereas @xmath8 is the mean growth velocity ( which may of course be zero ) . finally , the random variable @xmath9 models the noise due to the fast degrees of freedom . depending on the physical problem at hand , either gaussian white noise or spatially and/or temporally correlated noise",
    "is usually considered @xcite .    in the context of kinetic roughening and nonequilibrium",
    "growth processes eq .",
    "( [ ew1 ] ) is called the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xcite .",
    "this equation has been used for the description of many dynamical processes , as for example equilibrium step fluctuations with random attachment / detachment events at the step edge @xcite .",
    "this equation also describes the dynamics of a growing surface with a normal incidence of the incoming particles .",
    "an obliquely incident particle beam , however , generates anisotropies which can only be described by a more complex non - linear langevin equation @xcite .    in growth processes with mass conservation the following linear langevin equation ( with @xmath10",
    ") @xmath11 has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this equation is sometimes called the noisy mullins - herring ( mh ) equation .",
    "the noise term again reflects the physics of the investigated system . in the case of equilibrium fluctuations",
    "conserved noise must be considered , leading to the so - called model b dynamics @xcite . on the other hand , when studying out - of - equilibrium processes one can again focus on gaussian white noise or on noise which is correlated in space and/or time @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation ( [ wv1 ] ) is used for example to describe film growth via molecular beam epitaxy @xcite , equilibrium fluctuations limited by step edge diffusion @xcite or even tumor growth @xcite .    an important notion in nonequilibrium growth processes",
    "is that of dynamical scaling .",
    "dynamical scaling is nicely illustrated through the behavior of the mean - square width of the surface or interface which for a substrate of linear size @xmath12 scales as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the roughness exponent and @xmath15 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "for ew we have @xmath16 whereas for mh @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath14 depends on whether correlated or uncorrelated noise is considered .",
    "langevin equations have the drawback that they do not really mirror the atomistic processes underlying the fluctuations of the interfaces and surfaces . in order to capture the physics on the microscopic level one commonly",
    "designs simple atomistic models ( characterized by some specific deposition and/or diffusion rules ) which are then often studied numerically .",
    "however , it is not always clear what the corresponding langevin equation is .",
    "usually , numerical simulations are used in order to extract the exponents @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "( [ width2 ] ) ) which generally permit to relate the microscopic model to one of the langevin equations ( universality classes ) .",
    "these exponents , however , encode only partly the information given by a scaling behavior , as the scaling functions , like @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ width2 ] ) , are themselves different for different universality classes .",
    "in this paper we focus on two - point quantities as for example the space - time response and the space - time correlation functions which also display a dynamical scaling behavior . on a more fundamental level",
    "we show , using arguments first given in @xcite , that in systems described by the equations ( [ ew1 ] ) and ( [ wv1 ] ) the scaling functions of these two - point quantities can be derived by exclusively exploiting the symmetry properties of the underlying _ noiseless _ , i.e. deterministic , equations .",
    "this approach , which is based on generalized , space and time dependent , symmetries of the dynamical system @xcite , has in the past already been applied successfully in the special case @xmath16 to systems undergoing phase ordering @xcite and to nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "here we show that local space - time symmetries also permit to fix ( up to some numerical factors ) the scaling functions of space - time response and correlation functions in cases where @xmath17 . on a more practical level",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of the scaling functions of these two - point quantities ( which depend on two different space - time points ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) and ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) ) in the characterization of the universality classes of nonequilibrium growth processes . whereas in the study of critical systems scaling functions , which are universal and characterize the different universality classes , are routinely investigated ( and this both at equilibrium @xcite and far from equilibrium @xcite ) , in nonequilibrium growth processes the focus usually lies on simple quantities like for example the exponents @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "there are some notable exceptions where scaling functions have been discussed ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but these studies were in general restricted to one - time quantities .",
    "however , also in nonequilibrium growth processes scaling functions of two - point functions are universal and should therefore be very valuable in the determination of the universality class of a given microscopic model or experimental system .",
    "we illustrate this by computing through monte carlo simulations the two - point space - time correlation function for two microscopic models which have been proposed to belong to the same universality class as the edwards - wilkinson equation ( [ ew1 ] ) with gaussian white noise @xcite .    the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we discuss the ew and the mh equations in more detail and introduce the two - point functions .",
    "section iii is devoted to the computation of the exact expressions of the space - time correlation and response functions by fourier transformation .",
    "these exact results show _",
    "inter alia _ that the response of the system to the noise does not depend explicitely on the specific choice of the noise itself . in section",
    "iv we discuss the space - time symmetries of the noiseless equations , whereas in section v we show how these symmetries can be used for the derivation of the scaling functions of two - point functions . in section",
    "vi we numerically study two microscopic growth models which have been proposed to belong to the edwards - wilkinson universality class .",
    "there has been a recent debate on the universality class of these models which we resolve by studying the scaling function of the space - time correlation function .",
    "finally , in section vii we give our conclusions .",
    "some technical points are deferred to the appendices .",
    "our main interest in this paper is the investigation of space - time quantities in systems described by the quite general linear stochastic equations ( [ ew1 ] ) and ( [ wv1 ] ) . setting the mean growth velocity @xmath8 to zero ( which can always be achieved by transforming into the co - moving frame ) both cases",
    "can be captured by the single equation @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( ew ) or @xmath23 ( mh ) .",
    "as it is well known , these equations of motion can be derived from a free field theory @xcite .",
    "depending on the physical context , different types of noise may be considered . for the ew case",
    "we shall discuss both gaussian white noise ( ew1 ) @xmath24 and spatially correlated noise ( ew2 ) @xmath25 with @xmath26 . in the past , these two types of noise have been used in the modeling of nonequilibrium growth processes @xcite . if , however , one wishes to model thermal equilibrium interface fluctuations , as for example step fluctuations rate - limited by evaporation - condensation , one has to consider white noise with the einstein relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the temperature and @xmath29 the boltzmann constant . for the mh case",
    "we also consider the noises ( [ white_noise ] ) and ( [ colored_noise1 ] ) , called mh1 and mh2 in the following . in this case , however , white noise can only be used in nonequilibrium situations as it breaks the conservation of mass encoded in the langevin equation ( [ wv1 ] ) .",
    "we shall not consider here the noisy mullins - herring equation with conserved noise which assures the relaxation towards equilibrium of a system with conserved dynamics , as this is covered by a forthcoming publication of one of the authors @xcite .",
    "two - time quantities have been shown in many circumstances to yield useful insights into the dynamical behavior of systems far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "of special interest are space and time dependent functions as for example the space - time response @xmath30 or the height - height space - time correlation @xmath31 where the brackets indicate an average over the realization of the noise .",

    "this section is devoted to the computation of space - time quantities by directly solving the langevin equations ( [ ew1 ] ) and ( [ wv1 ] ) in the physically relevant cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these exact results will be used in the following in two different ways . in section",
    "v we use these expressions in order to check whether our approach , which exploits exclusively the generalized space - time symmetries of the deterministic part of the equation of motion , yields the correct results .",
    "in addition , in section vi we compare these expressions with the numerically determined scaling functions obtained for two different atomistic models in order to decide on the universality class of these models .      in order to compute the response of the surface / interface to a small perturbation we add the term @xmath50 to the right - hand side of the langevin equation and then go to reciprocal space . in the ew case the solution of the resulting equation is ( with @xmath48 , 2 ) @xmath51 where we denote by @xmath52 , @xmath53 resp . @xmath54 the fourier transform of @xmath1 , @xmath55 resp . @xmath50 .",
    "we thereby assume flat initial conditions at time @xmath56 , @xmath57 , i.e. we prepare the system in an out - of - equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "this preparation enables us to study the approach to equilibrium for the ew1 case with a valid einstein relation . for the corresponding study of equilibrium dynamical properties (",

    "( [ cond_asymptotics ] ) it then follows that @xmath193 recalling that for the mh case @xmath17 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 , it is now easy to check that the proposed scaling function together with ( [ choice_constants ] ) indeed yields the exact result ( [ resp_res_wv2 ] ) up to the normalization constant @xmath147 .",
    "this so determined two - point function can then be inserted into the correlation function ( [ correlation_full2 ] ) , yielding the exact result ( [ res_mwv_corr ] ) .",
    "this is again most easily seen by using the integral representation @xmath196 of the response function ( [ resp_res_wv2 ] ) .    in two dimensions we have to replace the expression ( [ twopoint_z4 ] ) by ( [ app : twopoint_z4_d2 ] ) .",
    "it follows that in @xmath49 the scaling function obtained from lsi only contains two parameters which are furthermore related through the condition ( [ app : choice2 ] ) .",
    "we are therefore left with a single undetermined parameter which only appears as a numerical prefactor , similar to the ew case . inserting the resulting scaling function into the expressions ( [ response_full ] ) and ( [ correlation_full2 ] ) readily yields the exact results for the space - time quantities in two dimensions .",
    "many theoretical studies of growth processes focus on atomistic models where particles are deposited on a surface and are then incorporated into the growing surface following some specific rules which might include local diffusion processes . of special interest",
    "is the determination of the universality class to which these models belong .",
    "this is usually achieved by computing some universal quantities through numerical simulations and comparing them to the corresponding quantities obtained from continuum growth equations like the ew and the mh equations discussed in this paper . in a commonly used approach one focuses on the estimation of the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath14 , which govern the behavior of the surface width ( [ width2 ] ) , through the best data collapse .    in order to show that it is useful to look at two - time quantities in nonequilibrium growth processes we discuss in the following the space - time correlation function in the family model @xcite and in a variant of this model @xcite .",
    "even so these are very simple models , there is still some debate on the universality class to which these models belong , especially in 2 + 1 dimensions . whereas earlier numerical studies yielded the value @xmath16 for the dynamical exponent in the 2 + 1-dimensional family model @xcite , in agreement with the ew universality class with gaussian white noise , pal et al .",
    "@xcite in their study obtained a value @xmath197 , pointing to a different universality class .",
    "in addition they studied a variant of this model ( which we call restricted family model in the following ) for which they recovered @xmath16 .",
    "these results of pal et al . are surprising , especially so as vvedensky succeeded @xcite in deriving in 1 + 1 dimensions the ew equation with gaussian white noise from both the family and the restricted family model through a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the family model is a ballistic deposition model with surface diffusion where a particle is dropped at a randomly chosen surface site . instead of fixing itself at this site",
    ", the particle first explores the local environment ( usually one restricts this exploration to the nearest neighbors ) and fixes itself at the lattice site with the lowest height .",
    "when two or more lattice sites other than the originally selected site have the same lowest height , one of these sites is selected randomly . in case",
    "the originally chosen lattice site is among the sites with the lowest height , the particle remains at this site . in the restricted version of this model , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "the particle only moves to a site of lowest height when it is unique .",
    "this change has the effect that the moving of the particle only contributes deterministically to the surface shape .",
    "we have simulated these two models both in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "for the 1 + 1 dimensional models all previous studies agree that @xmath16 and that both models belong to the one - dimensional ew universality class with gaussian white noise .",
    "our main interest here is the height - height space - time correlation function @xmath198 . from the exact results presented in the first part of the paper we conclude that this two - time quantity should only depend on the two scaling variables @xmath199 and @xmath200 where @xmath201 . in figure 1",
    "we test this expected scaling behavior in the 1 + 1 dimensional family model . in figure 1a",
    "we fix @xmath199 und plot the correlation function as a function of @xmath200 , whereas in figure 1b @xmath200 is fixed and c is plotted vs @xmath199 .",
    "lattices with 12800 sites have been simulated and the data shown result from averaging over 1000 runs with different random numbers .",
    "the curves obtained for different values of the waiting time @xmath20 collapse on a common master curve when multiplying @xmath189 with @xmath202 . in addition , these master curves nicely agree with the expression ( [ full_corr1 ] ) obtained from the ew equation with uncorrelated white noise , once the nonuniversal constants @xmath203 and @xmath204 have been determined @xcite .",
    "a similar good agreement is obtained for the restricted family model .",
    "we list our estimates for @xmath203 and @xmath204 for both one - dimensional models in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "it follows from this table that @xmath203 and @xmath204 slightly differ in both models . in addition",
    ", @xmath205 is slightly larger for the restricted model , even so the error bars are overlapping .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the continuum description is not expected to completely describe the lattice models for small values of @xmath200 , as here the discrete nature of the lattice can not be neglected any more .",
    "deviations are indeed observed in figure 1b for @xmath206 and small values of @xmath199 .",
    "these lattice effects are expected to get stronger when the dimensionality of the system increases .",
    ".[table:1 ] estimates for the nonuniversal constants @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after having verified that the computed scaling functions in both versions of the 1 + 1 dimensional family model agree with the solution of the ew continuum equation , let us now proceed to the more controversial 2 + 1 dimensional case . in figure 2",
    "we display the space - time correlation computed for the original family model in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "again , in the left panel we fix @xmath199 , whereas in the right panel @xmath200 is kept constant .",
    "the data shown here have been obtained for lattices with @xmath207 sites with 5000 runs for every waiting time .",
    "we carefully checked that our nonequilibrium data are not affected by finite - size effects .",
    "furthermore , we ran different simulations with different random number generators and obtained the same results within error bars .",
    "we obtain as the main result of these simulations that the scaling function of the space - time correlation function is in excellent agreement ( once the values of the nonuniversal constants have been determined , see table 1 ) with the exact result obtained from solving the two - dimensional ew equation with uncorrelated white noise .",
    "the only discrepancies observed for small @xmath200 and small @xmath199 are qualitativly the same as for the 1 + 1 case and are explained by the discrete nature of the lattice .",
    "our results are in accordance with the results of @xcite but strongly disagree with those of pal et al",
    "indeed , a noninteger value of @xmath15 in a continuum description can not be realized in a linear stochastic differential equation and leads to completely different scaling functions as those obtained from the ew equation .",
    "in figure 3 ( see also table 1 ) we show our results for the restricted family model in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "again , dynamical scaling is observed , and again the data are well described by the ew scaling functions in the scaling limit .",
    "however , the determined values of the nonuniversal quantities @xmath203 and @xmath204 are markedly different from the values obtained for the original model . specifically , the ratio @xmath205 ( which is of the dimension @xmath208 ) is much larger for the restricted model . identifying @xmath205 with a ( nonequilibrium ) temperature",
    ", we can view the processes in the restricted model to take place at a higher temperature than in the original model .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation from pal et al .",
    "@xcite that the surface is locally rougher in the restricted model , as evidenced by the larger value of the interface width .",
    "in addition , the change in the diffusion rule leads to a nonmonotoneous behavior of the correlation function for small @xmath200 , as shown in the inset of figure 3a for @xmath209 and @xmath210 . plotting the correlation function in both the ( 10 ) and the ( 11 ) direction",
    ", we see that correlations between nearest neighbours are suppressed , whereas the autocorrelation , i.e. the correlation with @xmath211 , is strongly enhanced .",
    "this behavior can be understood by recalling that in the restricted model a particle only diffuses to a lower nearest neighbor site when this site is unique , but otherwise remains on the original site .",
    "if we increase @xmath20 and @xmath212 , this effect weakens , and it completely vanishes in the scaling limit of large waiting times and large values of @xmath200 .    from our observation that the numerically computed space - time correlation functions of both microscropic models coincide in the scaling limit with the exact expression from the ew model we conclude that both the family model and the restricted family model belong to the ew universality class with uncorrelated noise , and this not only in 1 + 1 dimensions but also in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold : on the one hand we discuss the usefulness of universal scaling functions of space - time quantities in characterizing the universality class of nonequilibrium growth models , on the other hand we demonstrate how a general symmetry principle allows to derive scaling functions of two - point quantities for equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes described by linear stochastic langevin equations .    in the context of",
    "nonequilibrium growth processes it is rather uncommon to study universal scaling functions of two - point quantities in the dynamical scaling limit in order to determine the universality class to which a given microscopic model belongs .",
    "we have illustrated the usefulness of this approach by comparing the numerically obtained space - time correlation functions for two atomistic growth models with the exact expressions obtained from the corresponding continuum stochastic langevin equation .",
    "this approach has allowed us to show that both models belong to the same universality class , thus correcting conclusions obtained in earlier numerical studies .",
    "the study of universal scaling functions of space - time quantities should also be of value in more complex growth processes which are no more described by linear stochastic differential equations .",
    "examples include ballistic deposition with an oblique incident particle beam @xcite or growth processes of the kpz @xcite and related @xcite universality classes where nonlinear effects can no more be neglected .",
    "in addition , the scaling functions studied here can also be measured in experiments involving nonequilibrium or equilibrium interface fluctuations .",
    "a promising system is given by equilibrium step fluctuations @xcite , as these are again described by linear langevin equations .",
    "in addition we have shown that in nonequilibrium growth processes scaling functions of out - of - equilibrium quantities can be derived in a _ model independent _",
    "way by exploiting the generalized space - time symmetries of the _ noiseless _ part of the stochastic equations of motion .",
    "we have demonstrated explicitly how to proceed in the case of a rational dynamical exponent @xmath15 , following the general ideas formulated by henkel a few years ago @xcite . in the context of nonequilibrium growth processes , the cases @xmath16 ( ew model ) and @xmath17 ( mh model ) are of special interest .",
    "the case @xmath16 has already been studied extensively in the past . for the case",
    "@xmath17 , however , we present to our knowledge for the first time the derivation of nonequilibrium scaling functions by exploiting the mentioned symmetry principles . as these scaling functions are found to agree with the exact expressions derived from the mh equation , we conclude that the postulated space - time symmetries and the proposed way for constructing the scaling functions can also be valid for other cases than merely the case @xmath16 .",
    "let us end this paper by a general remark on the applicability of the concept of local scale transformations in the context of other out - of - equilibrium processes .",
    "the data presented in this paper for the microscopic growth models nicely show the limitations of the continuum equations in describing atomistic models . whereas in the limit of large times and large spatial separations",
    "the numerically computed correlation functions completely agree with the exact results from the continuum equation , notable deviations are observed for small times and small spatial separations .",
    "these deviations reflect the microscopic details of the models ( underlying lattice structure , diffusion rules etc . ) which are not captured by the continuum model .",
    "this sheds an interesting light on an ongoing discussion @xcite on the applicability of the theory of local scale invariance , which , we recall , permits to derive expressions for scaling functions starting from the noiseless part of the _ continuum _ equations of motion . clearly , it has to be expected that the so derived scaling functions can not fully describe microscopic models in the short time and short distance limit .",
    "as it is exactly this limit which is in the centre of the mentioned discussion involving the theory of local scale invariance , it seems advisable to take any observed deviations in this limit between numerical data , obtained from simulations of microscopic models , and the theoretically derived scaling functions _ cum",
    "grano salis _ , as these deviations might only reflect the microscopic nature of the models .",
    "we here compile the exact results in two space dimensions for the dynamical two - time quantities for the mullins - herring case with @xmath17 .",

    "we solve ( [ appb : diff2 ] ) for @xmath245 under the additional assumption that the desired solution is nonsingular for @xmath246 .",

    "we then make the ansatz @xmath248 and suppose @xmath249 @xcite .",
