    "@xmath5 is complete and has non - negative sectional curvature , in particular non - negative ricci curvature .",
    "recently , using some of the results of @xcite , g.liu classified complete non - compact @xmath8-manifolds with non - negative ricci curvature    let @xmath9 be a complete noncompact @xmath8-manifold with non - negative ricci curvature .",
    "then either @xmath9 is diffeomorphic to @xmath10 or its universal cover @xmath11 is isometric to a riemannian product @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is a complete surface with non - negative sectional curvature .",
    "in particular it follows from the proof of this result that if @xmath9 is not flat nor has positive ricci curvature then its universal cover splits as a product @xmath5 .",
    "so the spaces @xmath5 are in fact general examples of a very important class of @xmath8-manifolds .",
    "we are interested in minimal surfaces in @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is as above .",
    "in particular we want information about the topology and the conformal structure .",
    "it is important to study under which hypothesis we can guarantee that a minimal surface is proper . concerning the topology , we know that there is no compact minimal surface in these spaces .",
    "so , one can study the genus and the number of ends of such minimal surfaces .",
    "concerning the conformal structure , one important property is _",
    "parabolicity_. our results are inspired by analogous results in @xmath10 .",
    "first we study the problem of properness . for manifolds with non - negative ricci curvature",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite , where some partial results in @xmath10 were obtained and the following theorem was proved :    let @xmath12 be a complete riemannian @xmath8-manifold of bounded geometry and positive ricci curvature .",
    "let @xmath13 be a complete injective minimal immersion , where @xmath4 is a complete oriented surface with bounded curvature .    1 .",
    "if @xmath9 is compact , then @xmath4 is compact ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath9 is not compact , then @xmath14 is proper .",
    "a major breakthrough was the work of colding and minicozzi @xcite , where it was proved that a complete minimal surface of finite topology embedded in @xmath10 is proper .",
    "after this , meeks and rosenberg proved that if @xmath4 is an complete embedded minimal surface in @xmath10 which has positive injectivity radius , then @xmath4 is proper , @xcite . finally , meeks and rosenberg proved that if @xmath15 is an injective minimal immersion , with @xmath4 complete and of bounded curvature , then @xmath14 is proper , @xcite .",
    "we extend it the last result for the case of a product @xmath5 :    let @xmath3 be a complete simply connected orientable non - compact surface such that @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be an injective minimal immersion of a complete , connected riemannian surface of bounded curvature .",
    "then the map @xmath14 is proper .",
    "next we focus on surfaces with finite topology and one end .",
    "the results in @xcite and @xcite imply that every complete , embedded minimal surface in @xmath10 of finite genus and one end is properly embedded and intersects some plane transversely in a single component , and so , is parabolic . in @xcite ,",
    "meeks and rosenberg gave an independent proof that the surface is parabolic without the additional assumption that it is embedded , namely they proved :    [ mrp ] let @xmath4 be a surface of finite topology and one end , and let @xmath18 be a proper minimal immersion .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 is transverse to a plane @xmath19 except at a finite number of points , and @xmath20 contains a finite number of components .",
    "then , @xmath4 is parabolic .    the half - space theorem of hoffman and meeks states that a properly immersed minimal surface in @xmath10 which is above a plane is a parallel plane , @xcite .",
    "thus the condition of a minimal surface be transverse to a plane is natural due to this theorem .",
    "rosenberg proved the following half - space theorem for product spaces :    let @xmath3 be a complete non - compact surface satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",

    "based on these results we prove the following :    suppose @xmath3 satisfies the conditions of the previous theorem .",

    "then an annular end of @xmath4 is asymptotic to a plane or to the end of a catenoid .",
    "let @xmath4 be as in the last theorem .",
    "the set @xmath30 of all the ends of @xmath4 has a natural topology that makes it a compact hausdorff space .",
    "the limit points in @xmath30 are called the _ limit ends _ of @xmath4 and an end which is not a limit end is called a _",
    "simple end_. to @xmath4 is associated a unique plane @xmath19 passing through the origin in @xmath10 called the limit tangent plane at infinity of @xmath4 .",
    "the ends of @xmath4 are linearly ordered by their relative heights over @xmath19 and this linear ordering , up to reversing it , depends only on the proper ambient isotopy class of @xmath4 in @xmath10 , @xcite .",
    "since @xmath30 is compact and the ordering is linear , there exists a unique _ top end _ which is the highest end and a unique _ bottom end _ which is lowest in the associated ordering .",
    "the ends of @xmath4 that are neither top nor bottom ends are called _",
    "middle ends_. in the proof of the ordering theorem , one shows that every middle end of @xmath4 is contained between two catenoids in the following sense : if @xmath31 is an end of @xmath4 there is @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .    in @xcite collin , kusner",

    "properly embedded minimal surface in @xmath10 are never _ limit ends_. we give meaning to a properly immersed minimal surface of @xmath5 to be contained between two catenoids and generalise the result above :    suppose @xmath3 be a complete non - compact surface satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",

    "we claim that it suffices to prove that each of the finite number of noncompact arcs @xmath244 in @xmath28 has a well - defined limit on the unit circle @xmath245 of points at infinity .",
    "in fact , assume the claim is true , then there is an open arc @xmath246 which does not contain limit points of @xmath244 .",
    "hence , there would be a half open disc @xmath247 centered at a point in @xmath248 , such that @xmath249 , see figure 2.1 . but @xmath250 is a proper domain which is contained in one of the parabolic surfaces @xmath251 or @xmath252 , so is parabolic .",
    "however @xmath250 does not have full harmonic measure , which is a contradiction .",
    "suppose @xmath253 has two limit points @xmath254 in @xmath245 .",
    "we first prove that at least one of the two interval components @xmath255 , @xmath256 of @xmath257 consists of limit points of @xmath253 .",
    "suppose not and let @xmath258 be points which are not limit points .",
    "since they are not limit points , there exists a @xmath93 such that the radial arcs @xmath259 and @xmath260 in @xmath239 of length @xmath2 and orthogonal to @xmath245 at @xmath261 respectively , are disjoint from @xmath253 . since @xmath253 is proper and disjoint from @xmath262 , the parametrized arc @xmath263 must eventually be in one of the two components of @xmath264 , see figure 2.2 .",
    "thus , @xmath253 can not have both @xmath265 and @xmath266 as limit points , a contradiction . now , suppose one of the intervals , say @xmath267 , contains one point @xmath268 which is not a limit point of @xmath253 , then by the previous argument the interval @xmath269 can not contain any point which is not a limit point .",
    "so one of the intervals consists of limit points of @xmath253 .",
    "since the height function is harmonic on @xmath239 and the generator of the homology of @xmath239 is a boundary in @xmath4 , by cauchy s theorem there is a conjugate harmonic function to @xmath222 , which we denote by @xmath270 . consider the holomorphic function @xmath271 . as the slice @xmath28 is transverse to @xmath239 , we have @xmath272 for all points in an arc @xmath253 and @xmath273 in this arc , where @xmath81 is a unit normal to @xmath4 .",
    "moreover as @xmath42 is holomorphic we have @xmath274 so @xmath275 is strictly monotone .",
    "thus @xmath42 restricted to any of the finite number of components in @xmath276 , monotonically parametrizes an interval on the imaginary axis @xmath277 .",
    "choose a closed half disc @xmath278 , centered at a point @xmath279 , where @xmath269 , as discussed above , consists entirely of limit points of @xmath280 , and suppose that @xmath281 is chosen sufficiently small so that @xmath282 . since @xmath283 is injective we can take a compact interval @xmath284 which is disjoint from the ends points of @xmath283 , @xmath285 , and choose @xmath286 sufficiently small such that @xmath287 .",
    "observe that @xmath42 maps @xmath286 into @xmath288 , so by the riemann mapping theorem , the function @xmath289 is essentially bounded in the sense that it maps @xmath286 into a domain that is conformally equivalent to an open subset of the unit disc .",
    "it follows from fatou s theorem that the holomorphic function @xmath290 has radial limits almost everywhere , i.e. , @xmath286 is conformally the unit disc , so radial limits are with respect to the radii of the unit disc .",
    "consider the radial arc @xmath168 orthogonal to @xmath245 at the point @xmath23 ( the center of @xmath269 ) .",
    "the arc @xmath168 divides @xmath269 in two intervals @xmath291 and @xmath292 and separates @xmath286 in two regions @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "choose @xmath93 small .",
    "we can suppose @xmath286 is inside the region @xmath295 . since @xmath280 is proper , this arc will eventually be inside of @xmath296 . as @xmath269",
    "is composed of accumulation points of @xmath280 and @xmath297 is not equal to @xmath269 , the arc @xmath280 leaves @xmath286 and returns to it an infinite number of times , and it does this crossing the boundaries of @xmath293 and @xmath294 infinitely many times , in each step getting closer to @xmath298 and @xmath299 respectively , see figure 2.3",
    ". then there exists an infinite number of arcs in @xmath300 ( respectively @xmath301 ) converging to @xmath298 ( respectively @xmath299 ) , see figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "thus the points of @xmath297 with radial limits for @xmath42 have a constant value which corresponds to the limiting endpoint of the curve @xmath302 in @xmath303 .",
    "however by privalov s theorem , a nonconstant meromorphic function on the unit disc can not have a constant radial limit on a set of @xmath297 with positive measure , a contradiction .",
    "let @xmath4 be a properly immersed minimal surface inside the region of @xmath5 defined by @xmath35 , for some constant @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath4 is parabolic .",
    "moreover , if @xmath4 has compact boundary , then @xmath4 has quadratic area growth and a finite number of ends .",
    "let @xmath130 be the distance to @xmath23 on @xmath3 extended to @xmath5 in the natural way and @xmath222 be the height function on @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath307 be the vertical cylinder of radius @xmath308 and let @xmath309 be the part of @xmath4 inside @xmath310 .",
    "let @xmath311 be the ball of @xmath5 of center @xmath312 and radius @xmath308 .",
    "since @xmath5 has the product metric and @xmath23 is a pole in @xmath43 , the point @xmath312 is a pole in @xmath5 .",
    "thus @xmath313 is inside the interior of @xmath310 .",
    "then it suffices to prove that @xmath309 has quadratic area growth as a function of @xmath130 .",
    "using these coordinates we can define a horizontal vector field @xmath125 that is orthogonal to @xmath314 and @xmath315 and has norm 1 , so @xmath316 is an orthonormal basis at each point of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath81 be a unit normal to @xmath4 , so @xmath317 @xmath318 and @xmath319 hence , @xmath320 thus , @xmath321        since @xmath328 is proper in @xmath329 and @xmath4 is proper , @xmath328 is proper in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover @xmath330 , so @xmath42 is a non - negative proper superharmonic function on @xmath4 .",
    "this proves that @xmath4 is parabolic .",
    "+ suppose @xmath331 is compact .",
    "there exists @xmath332 such that @xmath333 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath334 , since @xmath42 is proper , @xmath335\\bigr)$ ] is compact , then we can apply the divergence theorem and use the fact that @xmath42 is superharmonic to obtain @xmath336)}\\delta_{\\sigma}g\\ d\\mu = -\\int_{g^{-1}(t_{1})}|\\nabla_{\\sigma}g|\\ dl + \\int_{g^{-1}(t_{2})}|\\nabla_{\\sigma}g|\\ dl.\\ ] ]        since @xmath342 and @xmath346 ( @xmath347 a constant ) , we have @xmath348 .",
    "again by the divergence theorem , @xmath349 where @xmath84 is the outward conormal to the boundary of @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath350 which implies there is a constant @xmath351 such that @xmath352      therefore @xmath4 has quadratic area growth .",
    "+ now , suppose @xmath4 has an infinite number of ends .",
    "let @xmath31 be an end of @xmath4 .",
    "choose @xmath354 such that for each positive integer @xmath59 , there is a distance ball @xmath355 of @xmath5 inside the region @xmath356 between @xmath357 and @xmath358 , with @xmath359 . by the monotonicity formula for minimal surfaces ( see the chapter 7 of @xcite ) @xmath360 where @xmath361 is a constant and @xmath362 . denote @xmath363 , since in each region @xmath356 , @xmath364 , we have a portion of @xmath31 of area at least @xmath365 it follows that @xmath366      since this holds for each end , choosing @xmath44 ends we obtain that the area of @xmath4 inside @xmath367 satisfies @xmath369 but for @xmath44 sufficiently large this leads to a contradiction .",
