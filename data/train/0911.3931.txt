    "therefore if we know the assertion is satisfied for @xmath432 for each of them with positive probability , we obtain the assertion for @xmath433 .",
    "( to see this , it is useful to note that for any @xmath434 , @xmath394 contains a `` plus sign '' formed by lines parallel to the sides bisecting the square in two equal parts .",
    "moreover , the union of the projections of the plus signs in each square in @xmath435 contains the projection of the plus sign in @xmath43 . )",
    "the second remark is that we can freely assume that @xmath436 is arbitrarily far away from @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , again with positive probability all the four first level subsquares belong to @xmath46 and the ( relative ) distance from @xmath436 to each of them is already at least two times greater than the ( relative ) distance from @xmath436 to @xmath43 . repeating this , we only need to know the assertion for @xmath436 at very large distance from @xmath43 to prove the assertion for all @xmath437 .",
    "there will be two cases : @xmath436 is in a direction approximately horizontal / vertical from @xmath43 , or @xmath436 lies in a `` diagonal '' direction . for notational simplicity",
    "we translate the picture so that @xmath43 is centred at the origin . by symmetry , it is enough to consider the cases stated in lemmas  [ lem : mi1 ] and [ lem : mi2 ] below , which completes the proof .",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "we will call a line @xmath1 * passing * through a square @xmath48 if it intersects two parallel sides of @xmath48 . note that , provided @xmath443 is sufficiently large , any line containing @xmath444 and intersecting @xmath445 is passing through one of the sixteen second level subsquares of @xmath43 ( hitting their vertical sides ) . as each of those subsquares has positive probability of belonging to @xmath49",
    ", it is enough to prove that with positive probability all the lines containing @xmath446 and passing through @xmath43 intersect @xmath3 , where @xmath447 satisfies @xmath448 , @xmath449 and @xmath450 .",
    "given @xmath451 and @xmath452 , let @xmath453 be the number of squares @xmath454 passed by the line @xmath455 going through @xmath456 and @xmath457 .",
    "we denote by @xmath458 the subarc of @xmath459 determined by the lines @xmath455 passing through @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath101 be so large that @xmath460 and let @xmath461 .",
    "this is the point where we use that @xmath60 . as is easy to check , every line containing @xmath456 and passing through @xmath43 intersects at most @xmath462 of the @xmath463 level subsquares of @xmath43 , passing through at least @xmath464 of them",
    "hence , by , for each of those lines the expected number of squares in @xmath465 passed by the line is greater than 2 .",
    "we want to apply an appropriate large deviation theorem to show that with positive probability , for each @xmath456 and @xmath457 the function @xmath453 will actually increase exponentially fast with @xmath68 .",
    "this will in particular imply that @xmath455 has non - empty intersection with @xmath466 for all @xmath68 , thus with @xmath3 as well , which is precisely the statement we need .",
    "we parametrise the space of lines @xmath467 by their intersection point with the vertical line @xmath468 and by the angle they make with the @xmath23-axis .",

    "@xmath471 defines a smooth curve @xmath472 on @xmath469 .",
    "these curves divide @xmath469 into components denoted by @xmath473 .",
    "each @xmath474 is such that for any two lines @xmath475 the set of subsquares of @xmath43 of level @xmath68 passed by @xmath372 and by @xmath476 is the same ( and the boundary lines of each @xmath474 pass through the same subsquares the other lines in @xmath474 pass through , plus possibly some additional ones ) .",
    "hence , @xmath477 is constant on each @xmath474 ( and can only increase at the boundary points ) .",
    "we claim that the number of these components is at most @xmath478 .",
    "note that the components are faces of the planar graph whose vertices are the intersection points of the curves @xmath472 and edges are the pieces of @xmath472 between vertices . by euler s theorem ,",
    "the number of faces is less than twice the number of vertices . since there is at most one line going through @xmath479 and @xmath480 for @xmath481 , @xmath472 and @xmath482 intersect at most once .",
    "thus the number of vertices is at most @xmath483 , where @xmath484 is the number of corner points .",
    "this yields our claim .    for each @xmath485 ,",
    "let @xmath486 be a collection of representatives of the components @xmath487 .",
    "let @xmath488 be the event @xmath489 further , let @xmath490 .",
    "because of the way the components @xmath491 were defined , it will be enough to show that @xmath492 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath496 holds , and consider a line @xmath497 by assumption , @xmath498 passes through at least @xmath499 squares in @xmath500 . by , if @xmath48 is one of these squares , the expected number of squares in @xmath501 that @xmath498 hits inside @xmath48 is strictly greater than @xmath247 .",
    "thus , conditioned on @xmath500 , @xmath502 is the sum of at least @xmath499 i.i.d",
    ". bounded random variables with expectation @xmath503 .",
    "note that the distribution of these random variables is independent of @xmath68 . by standard large deviation results ( for example one could use the azuma - hoeffding inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.2.1 ) as in the proof of lemma  [ azuma ] ) , we see that @xmath504 for some @xmath505 which does not depend on @xmath68 or @xmath506 . in other words , @xmath507 .",
    "the events @xmath488 are clearly increasing , whence we can apply the fkg - inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) to obtain @xmath508 therefore @xmath509 since @xmath510 goes to @xmath429 superexponentially fast while @xmath511 grows only exponentially fast , the infinite product converges .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the second case was essentially done in @xcite and the proof is very similar to the proof of lemma  [ lem : mi1 ] , but for completeness we will remind here the basic steps of the proof . at the same time , since the proof is very similar , we give a sketch of the proof of theorem  [ ramssimon ] .",
    "we begin with some notation .",
    "given @xmath48 , a subsquare of @xmath43 , let @xmath517 and @xmath518 be the squares with the same centre as @xmath48 and having side length @xmath519 and @xmath520 times the side length of @xmath48 , respectively , where @xmath521 note that @xmath518 is contained in the interior of @xmath517 .    given a line @xmath1 , which is neither horizontal nor vertical , we define @xmath522 and @xmath523 where the number of elements in a set @xmath72 is denoted by @xmath524 .",
    "let @xmath525 be the version of the above , where @xmath360 is replaced by @xmath389 .",

    "note that the near - horizontal and near - vertical cases are dealt with in lemma  [ lem : mi1 ] . )",
    "similarly to the proof of lemma  [ lem : mi1 ] , we can then check that if , for some finite family @xmath529 of cardinality @xmath82 , one has that @xmath530 then with probability @xmath531 , @xmath532 ( and similarly for @xmath533 , @xmath534 ) . with positive probability ( e.g. corresponding to the probability that all squares of level @xmath101 are chosen ) , the equation is satisfied for @xmath535 for all @xmath536 ( resp . @xmath537for @xmath538 ) .    as @xmath539 , whenever @xmath457 belongs to the projection of @xmath518 , all @xmath456 close to @xmath457 belong to the projection of @xmath517 .",
