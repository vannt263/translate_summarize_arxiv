    "this allows us to estimate the ssfr , with minimal contamination from emission lines .",
    "we obtain the mean ssfr through stellar population modeling of our stacked photometry , leaving out the [ 3.6 ] measurement .",
    "the modeling was performed with fast @xcite , using the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) stellar populations synthesis models . we use a @xcite imf with limits 0.1 - 100@xmath26 and a @xcite dust - law .",
    "we consider ages between 10myr and the age of the universe at @xmath145 and dust extinction between @xmath168 . a constant star formation history and subsolar metallicity ( 0.2z@xmath150 ) is assumed .",
    "we fix the redshift to the median of the photometric redshifts , at @xmath169 .",
    "given this freedom of parameters the mean sed is best described by a fairly young galaxy ( age @xmath170myr ) and reasonable dust ( @xmath171 ) in order to fit both the small balmer break ( @xmath172\\sim0.2 $ ] ) and moderately red uv - continuum slope ( @xmath173 ) , resulting in a notably high ssfr of @xmath174 ( see the sed in figure [ fig : results_sed ] ) .",
    "however , the interpretation of this result is not straightforward .",
    "first of all , we have only the [ 4.5 ] band in the rest - frame optical to break the age - dust degeneracy .",
    "given our modest sample there is still a range of models that can fit the data well .",
    "a possibly more insightful answer is obtained when we fix the dust to the expected value derived from the typical spread of uv - continuum slopes and the @xcite law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we use the @xcite relation to convert h@xmath13 luminosity to star formation rate and we use bc03 models ( assuming no dust ) to convert the rest - frame optical continuum light to stellar mass . using these assumption",
    "we obtain a lower limit on the ssfr for our seven source sample and the bluest four sources of @xmath176 and @xmath177 respectively , based on the robust lower limits on the [ oiii]+h@xmath2 ew derived in  [ sec : stack ] .",
    "comparing with direct constraints at @xmath9 we estimate @xmath178 evolution in the ssfr over this redshift range , in good agreement with estimates at @xmath3 based on a few spectroscopically confirmed sources @xcite and extrapolating the h@xmath13 ews from lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "our derived constraint is also in agreement with theoretical models that predict the ssfr to follow the specific infall rate of baryonic matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we present the cleanest evidence yet for very high [ oiii]+h@xmath13 ews in the @xmath3 galaxy population .",
    "we also simultaneously explore a strategy for obtaining a clean measurement of the ssfr at @xmath3 based on the stellar continuum flux measured in the [ 4.5 ] micron band  which is largely free of contamination from the strongest nebular lines .",
    "nebular emission lines ( [ oiii ] , h@xmath13 , h@xmath2 ) and the extreme faintness of @xmath1 galaxies make it extremely challenging to establish the stellar masses and ssfrs of the typical galaxy at high redshift .    to overcome these issues , we have isolated a small sample of nine bright ( @xmath179 mag ) , magnified galaxies in the redshift range @xmath4 from clash and other programs , seven of which we can perform high - quality irac photometry .",
    "galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath4 are useful , since there the [ 4.5 ] band from spitzer / irac provides us with a clean measurement of the stellar continuum flux from galaxies in the rest - frame optical , free of contamination from dominant nebular emission lines ( figure [ fig : emlines ] and figure [ fig : emlines_example ] ) .    for the mean source in our sample",
    ", we find that we can set a robust lower limit on the rest - frame ew of [ oiii]+h@xmath2 of 637 .",
    "for this lower limit , we adopt the bluest conceivable @xmath6-[4.5]$ ] colors for the stellar continuum and assume that all sources in our sample are at @xmath132 where a given [ oiii]+h@xmath2 ew would produce the most extreme @xmath6-[4.5]$ ] color .",
    "use of a more realistic redshift distribution for our sample , i.e. , consistent with the photometric redshift estimates and not assuming that all sources are at @xmath132 , suggest that these lower limits may underestimate the true ews by a factors of @xmath7 .",
    "the four bluest sources in our selection ( 58% of our sample ) show evidence for even more extreme line emission , with @xmath6-[4.5]\\lesssim-0.8 $ ] .",
    "for these 4 sources , we can set a robust lower limit of 1582 on the rest - frame ew in [ oiii]+h@xmath2 .    extreme line emission with ews",
    "greater 1000 has been found at lower redshift in low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with the idea that extreme line emission may be present in the typical star - forming galaxy at @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , our [ 4.5 ] stack results imply a firm lower limit on the ssfr of @xmath180 for star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "if any sources from our @xmath4 photometric redshift sample lie at lower or higher redshifts than this , it would imply even lower [ 4.5 ] micron fluxes for the stack and hence higher ssfrs .",
    "compared with ssfrs measurements at @xmath9 @xcite , this implies at least a @xmath178 evolution in the ssfr over the redshift range @xmath9 to @xmath3 .",
    "similar to a few other spectroscopically confirmed @xmath3 galaxies in the literature @xcite , this provides strong evidence that the ssfrs at @xmath3 are high .",
    "we expect improvement in these results through the measurement of spectroscopic redshifts for our sample from deep spectroscopy .",
    "this should allow us to obtain an even cleaner selection of @xmath4 galaxies from which to quantify the emission line contamination and ssfrs .",
    "follow - up observations of our sample are facilitated by the fact that these candidates are typically @xmath151 magnitude brighter than similar candidates found in the field , making these efforts quite feasible in terms of the telescope time required .",
    "moreover , our bright @xmath3 sample is small and the s /",
    "n we have per source is still modest .",
    "increases in sample size can come from shallow surveys over a larger numbers of clusters , such as those available from recent snapshot programs .",
