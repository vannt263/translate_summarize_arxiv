    "relativistic tidal problems have been extensively studied in the literature in a variety of contexts .",
    "tidal effects are responsible for deformations or even disruption of astrophysical objects ( like ordinary stars but also compact objects like neutron stars ) placed in strong gravitational fields . for instance , they play a central role in the merging of compact object binaries , which can be accurately modeled only by numerical simulations in full general relativity , solving the coupled einstein - hydrodynamics equations needed to evolve relativistic , self - gravitating fluids @xcite .",
    "such tidal disruption events are expected to happen very frequently in the universe , leading then to a possible detection of the associated emission of gravitational waves in the near future by ground - based detectors @xcite .",
    "to this end , different analytical and semi - analytical approaches have been developed to properly describe at least part of the coalescence process and to study the associated gravitational wave signals @xcite .",
    "these approaches usually require either post - newtonian techniques or first order perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , in this limit the motion of each individual compact object in the binary system can be treated as the motion of an extended body in a given gravitational field due to its companion under the assumption that it causes only a small perturbation on the background @xcite .",
    "finally , one can also be interested in studying the tidal disruption limit of ordinary stars and compact objects in the field of a black hole ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "tidal problems of this kind can be treated within the so - called tidal approximation , i.e. , by assuming that the mass of the star is much smaller than the black hole mass and that the stellar radius is smaller than the orbital radius , so that backreaction effects on the background field can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the star is usually described as a self - gravitating newtonian fluid and its center of mass is assumed to move around the black hole along a timelike geodesic path . the tidal field due to the black hole",
    "is then computed from the riemann tensor in terms of the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "the role of the observer in relativistic tidal problems has never received enough attention in the literature . nevertheless , it is crucial in interpreting the results .",
    "in fact , if tidal forces are due to curvature , the latter is experienced by observers through the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor , which is the only true @xmath0-dimensional invariant quantity . in contrast",
    ", its electric and magnetic parts depend by definition on the choice of the observers who perform the measurement . in a recent paper @xcite we have addressed such an issue by providing all necessary tools to relate the measurement of tidal effects by different families of observers .",
    "we have considered two tidal indicators \" defined as the trace of the square of the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor , respectively .",
    "they are both curvature and observer dependent and we have investigated their properties by considering a number of special observer families in the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetime . as an interesting feature",
    "we have shown that the electric - type indicator can not be made as vanishing with respect to any such observers , whereas the family of carter s observers is the only one which measures zero tidal magnetic indicator .",
    "we have argued that the explanation for this effect relies on the absence of a quadrupole moment independent on the rotational parameter for the kerr solution . to answer this question , as well as to extend the previous analysis to a more general context , we consider here a solution of the vacuum einstein field equations due to quevedo and mashhoon @xcite , which generalizes the kerr spacetime to include the case of matter with arbitrary mass quadrupole moment and",
    "is specified by three parameters , the mass @xmath1 , the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath2 and the quadrupole parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it is its genuine quadrupole moment content which makes this solution of particular interest here .",
    "we will thus investigate how the shape deformation of the rotating source affects the properties of tidal indicators with respect to special family of observers , including static observers , zamos ( i.e. , zero angular momentum observers ) and geodesic observers .",
    "hereafter latin indices run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 whereas greek indices run from @xmath6 to @xmath5 and geometrical units are assumed .",
    "the metric signature is chosen as @xmath7 .",
    "the exterior gravitational field of a rotating deformed mass can be described by the quevedo - mashhoon ( hereafter qm ) solution @xcite .",
    "this is a stationary axisymmetric solution of the vacuum einstein s equations belonging to the class of weyl - lewis - papapetrou @xcite and is characterized , in general , by the presence of a naked singularity .",
    "although the general solution is characterized by an infinite set of gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic multipoles , we consider here the special solution discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that involves only three parameters : the mass @xmath1 , the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath2 and the mass quadrupole parameter @xmath3 of the source .",

    "all higher multipole moments can be shown to depend only on the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "some geometric and physical properties of the qm solution have been analyzed in ref .",
    "it turns out that the whole geometric structure of the qm spacetime is drastically changed in comparison with kerr spacetime , leading to a number of previously unexplored physical effects strongly modifying the features of particle motion , especially near the gravitational source .",
    "in fact , the qm solution is characterized by a naked singularity at @xmath33 , whose existence critically depends on the value of the quadrupole parameter @xmath3 . in the case",
    "@xmath34 ( kerr solution ) @xmath33 represents instead an event horizon .",
    "the qm solution reduces to the kerr spacetime in the limiting case @xmath35 , to the erez - rosen spacetime when @xmath36 and to the schwarzschild solution when both parameters vanish .",

    "@xcite that the general form of the qm solution is equivalent , up to a coordinate transformation , to the exterior vacuum hartle - thorne solution once linearized to first order in the quadrupole parameter and to second order in the rotation parameter .",

    "we have discussed the observer - dependent character of tidal effects associated with the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor with respect to an arbitrary family of observers in a generic spacetime .",
    "our considerations have then been specialized to the quevedo - mashhoon solution describing the gravitational field of a rotating deformed mass and to the family of stationary circularly rotating observers on the equatorial plane .",
    "this family includes static , zamos and geodesic observers and for each of them we have evaluated certain tidal indicators built up through the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor .",
    "the main difference from the kerr case examined in a previous paper is due to the presence of a genuine quadrupolar structure of the background solution adopted here : the total quadrupole moment of the source is not depending on the rotation parameter only , but there is also a further contribution due to the shape deformation directly related to the mass through a new mass quadrupole parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the properties of tidal indicators strongly depend on this new parameter .",
    "we have found that there exists a family of circularly rotating orbits associated with @xmath82 along which the magnetic tidal indicator vanishes identically as in the kerr case , playing the same role as carter s observers there .",
    "for special values of @xmath3 this property is also shared by other observer families , a novelty in comparison with the kerr case .",
    "however , still no observer family can be found for which the electric tidal indicator vanishes , a fact that can be explained in terms of curvature invariants .",
    "the tidal electric indicator can be but extremized several times close to the source , showing also a damped oscillating behavior .",
    "we have also investigated the relation between tidal indicators and bel - robinson tensor , i.e. , observer - dependent super - energy density and super - poynting vector .",
    "we have shown that the super - poynting vector identically vanishes for @xmath82 leading to minimal gravitational super - energy as seen by such a generalized carter s observer within the family of all circularly rotating observers at each spacetime point , a property already known to characterize carter s observers in the case of black hole spacetimes .",
