    "eta carinae s photometric record is unparalleled among well - studied objects , especially since it has been near or exceeded the classical eddington limit during the past two or three centuries . from 1700 to 1800",
    "it gradually brightened from 4th to 2nd magnitude , and then experienced its famous great eruption or `` supernova impostor event '' beginning about 1837 . for twenty years it was one of the brightest stars in the sky , rapidly fluctuating between magnitudes 1.5 and 0.0 , briefly attaining @xmath1 .",
    "after 1858 it faded below 7th magnitude , presumably enshrouded in the nascent homunculus nebula .",
    "subsequent behavior , however , has been more complex than one might have expected .",
    "a mysterious secondary eruption occurred in 18871900 ; then the apparent brightness leveled off around @xmath2 for about 40 years , followed by a rapid increase in 193853 ; after that it brightened at a fairly constant rate for another 40-year interval , and most recently the rate accelerated in the 1990 s .",
    "some , but not all , of the secular brightening can be attributed to decreasing obscuration as the homunculus nebula expands . however , in truth this is more complex than it appears .",
    "the star s physical structure has been changing in a decidedly non - trivial way which is , at best , only dimly understood . for historical and observational details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic changes have occurred along with the brightness variations .",
    "the 5.5-year spectroscopic / photometric cycle @xcite is not apparent in data obtained before the 1940 s @xcite .",
    "brief `` spectroscopic events '' marking the cycle are most likely mass - ejection or wind - disturbance episodes , probably regulated by a companion star @xcite . at visual wavelengths ,",
    "the associated ephemeral brightness changes represent mainly emission lines in the stellar wind , while the longer - term secular brightening trend involves the continuum @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have speculated that the four obvious disruptions in the photometric record  c.  1843 , 1893 , 1948 , and 2000  might indicate a quasi - periodicity of the order of 50 years . in any case",
    "the star has not yet recovered from its great eruption seen 160 years ago .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) treasury program for @xmath0 car was planned specifically to study the 2003.5 spectroscopic event .",
    "we employed the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , following earlier stis observations that began in 1998 @xcite .",
    "fortuitously , the stis data almost coincide with a rapid secular brightening which began shortly before 1998 ( see section 4 below ) .",
    "those and the acs images are of unique photometric value for at least two reasons :    1 .   at visual wavelengths , normal ground - based observations have been dominated by the surrounding homunculus ejecta - nebula , which , until recently , appeared much brighter than the central star and which has structure at all size scales from 0.1 to 8 arcseconds .",
    "_ so far , only the hst has provided well - defined measurements of just the central star . _",
    "the homunculus is primarily a reflection nebula , but the homunculus / star brightness ratio has changed substantially . during 1998 - 99 , for instance , the star nearly tripled in apparent brightness while ground - based observations showed only about a 0.3-magnitude brightening of homunculus plus star @xcite .",
    "this rather mysterious development is known from hst / stis and hst / acs data .",
    "numerous strong emission lines perturb the results for standard photometric systems .",
    "h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission , for example , have equivalent widths of about 800 and 180 respectively in spectra of @xmath0 car .",
    "broad - band @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 magnitudes , and most medium - band systems as well , are therefore poorly defined for this object .",
    "photometry around 5500 , e.g. broad - band @xmath9 , is relatively free of strong emission lines , but transformations from instrumental magnitudes to a standard system require the other filters @xcite .",
    "this difficulty is somewhat lessened for hst observations restricted to the central star , whose spectrum has fewer emission lines than the bright ejecta ; and some of the hst / acs filters are fairly well - adapted to the case . at any rate",
    "the stis and acs data appear to be stable and internally consistent . detector and filter systems used in most ground - based work , on the other hand , require fluctuating instrumental and atmospheric corrections , and do not give any major advantage for this object .",
    "in this paper we present the complete set of photometric data gathered for the @xmath0 car hst treasury project .",
    "the central star has brightened , especially in the uv , since the hst results described by @xcite .",
    "we report three types of later measurements :    1 .",
    "the star s brightness in acquisition images made with stis before that instrument s failure in early 2004 .",
    "these images represent a broad , non - standard wavelength range from 6500 to 9000  .",
    "2 .   the star s brightness in acs / hrc images made in four filters ( f220w , f250w , f330w , & f550 m ) from october 2002 to the present .",
    "3 .   synthetic photometry in flux - calibrated stis spectra .    after presenting the data below",
    ", we briefly discuss the observed trends and what they bode for the near future of @xmath0 car .",
    "our principal reason for reporting these data now is that the treasury program observations have been completed ; future hst / acs observations are possible but not assured .",
    "these last treasury program observations are essential for demonstrating the secular trend in brightness ( see section [ trend ] ) , that these brightness changes suggest a fundamental change in the state of the star ( see section [ discussion ] ) and what the near future may hold for @xmath0 carinae ( [ predictions ] ) .",
    "each set of stis observations included a pair of acquisition images , which are 100 x 100 pixel sub - frames ( @xmath10 ) centered on the middle row and column of the ccd @xcite .",
    "the stis acquisition images were taken with a neutral density filter ( f25nd3 ) which , combined with the ccd response , covered the wavelength range 200011000  . since the star s apparent color is moderately red ,",
    "these images were dominated by fluxes at wavelengths 65009000  .",
    "[ filterfig ] shows that although most of the measured flux comes from the continuum , several prominent emission features including h@xmath3 contributed to the measured brightness .",
    "we measure the star s brightness with in radius @xmath7 in the following manner : if @xmath11 denotes the flux level in an image where the star was centered at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , we integrate the product of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a radially symmetric weighting function of the form @xmath16,@xmath17 . in effect",
    "@xmath15 is a `` parabolic virtual field aperture . '' for the stis acquisition images we chose @xmath18 ( 6 pixels ) . a detailed discussion of these reduction procedures , including a non - standard bias level correction which we applied , is given in @xcite .",
    "initially we expected to add a few more points of acquisition photometry after 2004.5 , but the failure of the stis in august 2004 curtailed our observing plans .",
    "thus we have only two additional stis data points to report ( table [ acqdata ] ) beyond those given in @xcite .",
    "they are useful , however , concerning the end of the post - event recovery ( see sections [ trend ] and [ discussion ] below ) .",
    "hst acs / hrc observations of @xmath0 car were obtained for the treasury project beginning in october 2002 .",
    "we have also examined publicly available data from hst proposal 9721 and hst proposal 10844 .",
    "the bias - corrected , dark - subtracted , and flat - fielded data were obtained from the space telescope science institute via the multi - mission archive ( mast ) @xcite .",
    "treasury program acs / hrc images were taken in four filters that cover near - uv to visual wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ filterfig ] ) :    * hrc / f220w and hrc/250w : these near - uv filters sample the `` forest '' @xcite , whose opacity increases dramatically during a spectroscopic event @xcite .",
    "* hrc / f330w : this filter includes the balmer continuum in emission , supplemented by various emission lines .",
    "it also attained the best spatial resolution among the observations reported here .",
    "* hrc / f550 m : with a medium - width ( not broad ) bandpass , this filter samples the visual - wavelength continuum flux with only minor contamination by emission features .",
    "the brightness of the central star was measured using the same 0.3@xmath19 ( @xmath20 10 acs / hrc pixels ) weighted virtual aperture used for the stis acquisition images .",
    "ccd flux values were converted to the stmag system @xcite using the keywords provided in the mast archive s fits headers .",
    "an aperture correction  la @xcite , calculated from observations of the white dwarf gd  71 in each of the filters ( table [ acscaltab ] ) , was applied to the measurements ( table [ acsdata ] ) .",
    "acs fluxes and magnitudes measured prior to mjd 52958 ( 2003.87 ) can be found in our first paper @xcite . _",
    "caveat : _ we did not apply the aperture corrections to the magnitudes in that paper , but we have done so in the plots shown here .    the f220w and f250w filters have known red leaks @xcite that can affect photometry of red sources .",
    "we convolved extracted stis spectra ( see sec .",
    "[ stisphot ] ) with the response function for those filters and the acs / hrc . in the case of the central star of @xmath0 car ,",
    "the flux redward of 4000 in the f220w and f250w filters contributed only about 0.25% and 0.06% respectively , insignificant compared to other sources of error .",
    "originally the acs / hrc images were meant to supplement the stis spectra . after the untimely demise of the stis , however , the acs / hrc became the most suitable mode for observing @xmath0 car with hst .",
    "this presented a problem of continuous monitoring in the same band passes over the entire program , since there were no acs / hrc images prior to 2002.78 while the stis data ended at 2004.18 .",
    "acs photometry can be synthesized from the flux calibrated stis data , since nearly every grating tilt was observed during each stis visit ( table [ stisspectra ] ) .",
    "the spectra were extracted with a weighted parabolic cross dispersion profile similar to the virtual aperture used to measure the acs / hrc images , convolved with the published filter functions ( fig [ filterfig ] ) , and integrated . because stmag is computed from flux density , the integrated fluxes were divided by the effective band passes of each filter ( see table [ acscaltab ] ) .",
    "the effective aperture for the extracted stis spectral data is not a rotated parabola but a parabolic cylinder having the width of the slit ( 0.1 ) . to correct for the difference in aperture as well as the difference in instrumental psf , slit throughput , and the extraction height , we converted the stis spectral fluxes to the acs / hrc flux scale using suitable correction factors ( table [ acscaltab ] ) .",
    "those factors were computed by comparing the results from acs / hrc images and photometry synthesized from stis data obtained at time mjd 52683 .",
    "the resulting synthetic acs / hrc photometry is given in table [ fakeacs ] .",
    "plots of these various data will be discussed in sections [ trend ] and [ discussion ] below .",
    "since hst and ground - based photometry have shown different rates of change for different - sized areas , it is useful to view the spatial distribution of the brightness . for this purpose",
    "we have used three acs images made with filter f550 m at @xmath21 2004.93 , 2005.53 , and 2005.85 . together",
    "these give a reasonably valid picture of the average visual - wavelength appearance during 2005 .",
    "[ brt - distr-1 ] shows the fraction of apparent brightness within projected radius @xmath7 measured from the central star .",
    "the solid curve represents the hst data , while a companion dashed curve incorporates gaussian blurring with fwhm = 0.8 , simulating ground - based photometry with fairly good atmospheric conditions .",
    "half the total light originates within @xmath22  which is very different from @xmath0 car s appearance a few decades ago @xcite .",
    "[ brt - distr-1 ] also shows a curve based on photographs that gaviola obtained in 1944 @xcite , with a magnified spatial scale to compensate for subsequent expansion ; even allowing for mediocre `` seeing '' and other uncertainties , the degree of central condensation was obviously less then . before 1980",
    "the central star accounted for less than 10% of the total apparent brightness ; now its fraction has grown to about 40% and continues to increase .",
    "[ brt - distr-2 ] is a map of the surface brightness , based on the hst / acs f550 m data mentioned above . in order to produce simple well - defined isophotes ,",
    "we have gaussian - blurred the image using fwhm 0.5 . apart from the central star and nearby compact ejecta",
    ", most of the light comes from a comma- or crescent - shaped region about 5 across , marked by the 80% isophote in the figure .",
    "presumably the high intensity in this area results from strong forward scattering by dust grains in that part of the southeast homunculus lobe . surface brightnesses in the outer lobe regions , on the other hand , are fainter than the 50% contour by factors typically between 100 and 200 . about half of the projected area of the homunculus provides only 5% of the total visual - wavelength brightness .",
    "fig .  [ plot1 ] shows the main hst photometric data on the central star ; the most significant result is a secular brightening trend superimposed on the 5.5-year pattern of spectroscopic events .",
    "the latest observations are essential in this regard , because the data reported earlier by @xcite ended before the star had emerged from the 2003.5 event and we could not be sure of the long term trend . from 1999 to",
    "2006 the average trend was about 0.15 magnitude per year at visual wavelengths and 0.19 mag yr@xmath23 at 2200   much faster than the rate of @xmath20 0.025 mag yr@xmath23 recorded for the homunculus plus star from 1955 to 1995 @xcite .",
    "the weigelt condensations northwest of the central star @xcite have _ not _ brightened rapidly . located in the equatorial plane only about 800 au from the star car s distance",

    "[ knotd ] shows the brightness of `` weigelt d , '' measured in the same way as the star but centering the virtual aperture at offset location @xmath24 , position angle 336@xmath25 .",
    "the absence of a strong secular trend is significant in the following way .",
    "extrapolating the recent trend of the star / ejecta brightness ratio back to the mid-1980 s , one would expect that the star should have been fainter than each of the weigelt blobs at that time .",
    "but this is contradicted by early speckle observations @xcite ; _ therefore the star can not have brightened at the present - day rate through the entire 20-year interval .",
    "_ moreover , the earliest hst / fos spectroscopy in 1991 @xcite and the ultraviolet spectra of the star plus inner ejecta obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) from 1979 to 1990 show absolute fluxes which , though uncertain , appear comparable to both the speckle observations and the 1998 stis results .",
    "these facts imply that the central star s brightening rate was relatively modest from 1980 until sometime in the 1990 s .",
    "we suspect that the present - day rate began in 199497 , when ground - based photometry showed unusual behavior ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the last f330w and f550 m observations in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] confirm the sudden 0.2 magnitude increase observed at la plata in late 2005 @xcite .",
    "the observed brightening of @xmath0 car is not easy to explain . it can not signify a major increase in the star s luminosity , because that would exceed the eddington limit , producing a giant eruption .",
    "it can not be a standard lbv - like eruption ; in that case the energy distribution should have shifted to longer wavelengths , the balmer emission lines should have decreased , and the spectrum should have begun to resemble an a- or f - type supergiant @xcite . in fact , qualitatively the star s spectrum has changed little in the past decade , and it has become bluer , not redder .",
    "car has long been known to have an abnormally small reddening / extinction ratio , see @xcite , @xcite , and refs .",
    "cited therein . ]",
    "the most obvious remaining explanation involves a change in the circumstellar extinction , which , in turn , probably requires a subtle change in the stellar wind .",
    "mere `` clearing of the dust '' ",
    "i.e. , motion of a localized concentration of dusty ejecta  can not occur fast enough @xcite",
    ". therefore one must consider either destruction of dust grains , or a decrease in the formation of new dust , or both ; and , if these account for the observations , why should they happen now ?",
    "the hypothetical decreasing extinction probably occurs within 2000 au ( @xmath20 1 ) of the star , and preferably closer , because :    1 .   in various observations between 1980 and 1995",
    ", the star did not appear as bright as expected relative to the weigelt blobs ; the discrepancy was a factor of the order of 10 , based on simple theoretical arguments @xcite . evidently , then , our line of sight to the star had substantially larger extinction at visual wavelengths , even though its projected separation from the blobs was less than 0.3 .",
    "the required extra extinction was of the order of 3 magnitudes .",
    "since then the star has brightened far more than the weigelt objects have ; therefore , if this involves localized extinction , its size scale must be a fraction of an arcsec , only a few hundred au .",
    "no known process seems likely to destroy dust more than 2000 au from the star in a timescale of only a few years .",
    "ground - based photometry and hst images have shown only a modest , fraction - of - a - magnitude increase in the brightness of the large - scale homunculus lobes during the past decade @xcite .",
    "dust grains should condense in @xmath0 car s wind at a distance of 200600 au , 2 to 10 years after the material has been ejected .",
    "car , we suppose that appreciable grain condensation begins in the outward flowing material at the location where the equilibrium grain temperature is around 1000 k. this is a fairly conventional assumption and the precise choice of temperature has little effect on our reasoning .",
    "the quoted time - after - ejection assumes typical ejecta speeds of 200700 km s@xmath23 . ] since newly - formed dust moves outward in a timescale of several years , the circumstellar extinction seen at any time depends partly on the current dust formation rate .",
    "this , in turn , depends on local wind density , radiation density , etc . , and newly formed hot grains ( @xmath26 k ) are susceptible to destruction .",
    "the dust column density can thus be sensitive to small changes in the stellar parameters .",
    "moreover , the wind is latitude - dependent and our line of sight is close to the critical latitude where wind parameters can vary rapidly @xcite .",
    "all these factors appear suitable for the proposed explanation .    on the other hand ,",
    "near - infrared observations imply that extinction within @xmath27 au has been quite small along most paths outward from the star . in fig .  3 of @xcite , for instance , the 26 @xmath28 m flux indicates the high end of the dust temperature distribution . modeling this in a conventional way",
    ", we find that less than 5% of the total luminosity was absorbed and re - emitted by inner dust with @xmath29 k during the years 1973 to 1990 when those observations were made . at wavelengths around 4 @xmath30 m . assuming a typical emission efficiency dependence @xmath31 , the observed spectral slope can be explained by a grain temperature distribution @xmath32 .",
    "the result noted in the text is obtained by normalizing this to match the observed flux around 4 or 5 @xmath28 m and then integrating the total emitted flux at all wavelengths due to grains above 500 k. ] therefore , _ our line of sight must be abnormal in order to have a large amount of extinction near the star . _ in principle one might view this as an argument against our proposed scenario , but no plausible alternative has been suggested to explain the apparent faintness of the central star before 1999 and its ratio to the weigelt blobs @xcite ,    the spatial distribution of dust is probably quite inhomogeneous near the star .",
    "the homunculus lobes have a conspicuously `` granular '' appearance ; the equatorial ejecta are clumpy , including the weigelt knots ; and stars near and above the eddington limit tend to produce clumpy outflows @xcite .",
    "consequently the radiative transfer problem includes macroscopic effects which have not yet been modeled .",
    "if the grain albedo is sufficient , light may escape mainly by scattering through interstices between condensations . in that case , high - extinction lines of sight may be fairly common in the inner region even though most of the light escapes along other paths , not necessarily radial .",
    "incidentally , the near - infrared photometric trends reported by @xcite are not straightforward to interpret . the fairly - constant 3.5 @xmath28 m flux , for instance ,",
    "represents a complicated mixture of dust formation parameters and does not necessarily indicate a constant amount of dust ; see comments by @xcite .",
    "if the observed brightening represents a decrease in circumstellar extinction , the likeliest reason for this to occur is through some change in the star ",
    "no one has yet proposed a suitable alternative .",
    "the most relevant stellar parameters are the radius , current luminosity , and surface rotation rate , which together determine the wind s velocity , density , and latitude structure .",
    "all of these may still be changing today , 160 years after the great eruption ; thermal and rotational equilibrium in particular are likely to be poor assumptions for the star s internal structure @xcite .    as a working hypothesis to explain @xmath0 car s photometric and spectroscopic record in the past 100 years ,",
    "let us tentatively suppose that _ the mass - loss rate is gradually decreasing , _ while the surface rotation rate may be increasing .",
    "historical considerations include :    1 .",
    "high - excitation emission , now observed at most times , was consistently absent before 1920 @xcite and probably before 1940 @xcite .",
    "if a hot companion star is present as most authors suppose , then the most obvious way to hide or suppress its helium ionization is to immerse the entire system in an extremely dense wind ",
    "i.e. , the primary star s mass - loss rate must have been larger then .",
    "this idea is far from straightforward @xcite , but so far as we know it is the only qualitative explanation yet proposed .",
    "informally , based on zanstra - style arguments ( i.e. , assessing the volume emission measure @xmath33 needed to absorb all the photons above 25 ev ) , we estimate that a rate of the order of 10 times the present value , i.e. @xmath34 @xmath35 y@xmath23 , would have been required early in the twentieth century in order to suppress the helium recombination emission .",
    "twenty years ago the amount of fresh dust , indicated by the near - infrared flux , appeared consistent with a mass - loss rate somewhat above @xmath36 @xmath37 yr@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this absorbed only a small fraction of the luminosity ( section 5.1 above ) , but the substantially higher mass - loss rate suspected for earlier times would have produced enough hot inner dust to absorb a non - negligible fraction .",
    "3 .   the brightness observed between 1900 and 1940 is rather mysterious .",
    "judging from its mass and present - day optical thickness , around 1920 the homunculus ( then only half as large as it is today ) should have had at least 5 magnitudes of visual - wavelength extinction ; in a simple model the object should have been fainter than 10th magnitude instead of @xmath2 as was observed .",
    "no doubt the inhomogeneities mentioned earlier played a role , but no model has been calculated .",
    "moreover , why did the brightness remain fairly constant even though the homunculus expanded by about 70% in 19001940 ?",
    "this interesting problem has received practically no theoretical attention .",
    "emission first appeared , and @xmath0 car s brightness suddenly increased , between 1938 and 1953 as we mentioned in section 1 .",
    "this might conceivably be explained by a decrease in the wind density ; but @xcite and @xcite have conjectured that 19401950 may have been the time when rotation became fast enough to produce latitude structure in the wind .",
    "if so , a higher - excitation , lower - density zone then developed at low latitudes @xcite .",
    "the above points inspire two hypotheses that may explain the rapid brightening trend shown in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] .",
    "first , if the mass - loss rate has been decreasing , this tends to reduce the column density of recently - formed dust along our line of sight . meanwhile ( or alternatively ) , perhaps the wind s latitude structure is continuing to evolve so that its dense zone is now moving out of the line of sight .",
    "hst data suggest that our line of sight has been fairly close to the critical boundary latitude separating the two phases @xcite .",
    "a small increase in surface rotation rate , or some other parameter change , might conceivably move the dense zone to higher latitudes , decreasing the amount of dust that forms along our line of sight .",
    "this idea is appealing because it suggests a way in which the effective extinction may be very sensitive to the stellar parameters .",
    "this problem obviously requires detailed models far beyond the scope of this paper , combining the star s changing structure , its wind , dust formation , and possibly dust destruction .      figs .",
    "[ plot1 ] and [ plot2 ] reveal no major surprises about the 2003.5 spectroscopic event , but several comments are worthwhile .",
    "first , the sharp drop in uv brightness ( filters f220w and f250w ) is qualitatively understood and does not involve circumstellar dust . during both the 1998 and the 2003 events , stis data showed very heavy ultraviolet blanketing by ionized metal lines ; indeed the star became quite dark at some wavelengths between 2000 and 3000  @xcite .",
    "we further note that just before the spectroscopic event , a slight increase occurred at wavelengths below 4000  ( filters f220w , f250w , f330w ) , but not at visual and far - red wavelengths ( f550 m and f25nd3 ) .",
    "ground - based visual - wavelength and near - ir photometry showed a qualitatively similar effect @xcite .",
    "the brightening is particularly prominent in j , h , and k which are dominated by free - free emission @xcite .",
    "the acs f550 m and stis f25nd3 data primarily measure the continuum brightness , while the other hst filters are heavily influenced by strong emission or absorption lines . at about the same time emission in",
    "the central star also went through a similar increase in brightness @xcite .",
    "the minor pre - event brightening thus appears to represent an increase in some emission features implying a temporary increase in ionizing flux . the primary star may provide additional uv photons or the hypothetical hot companion star may excite the primary wind more than usual at that time ( just before periastron ) , but no quantitative model has been attempted .    figs .",
    "[ plot1 ] and [ plot2 ] contain interesting hints about the timescale for the star s post - event recovery .",
    "four months after the 2003.5 event , for instance , the 210 kev x - ray flux had increased almost to a normal level @xcite . the hst / acs f220w and f250w brightnesses , however , were still quite low at that time , and they required about eight months to recover .",
    "this timescale must be explained in any valid model for the spectroscopic events .",
    "@xcite noted serious differences between stis spectra of the 1998.0 and 2003.5 events , and interpreted them as evidence for a rapid secular physical change in @xmath0 car .",
    "@xcite had earlier found that emission became progressively weaker after each of the last few spectroscopic events .",
    "these clues are obviously pertinent to our comments in section [ stellarparams ] above",
    ".    fluctuations _ between _ spectroscopic events have received little attention in the past .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] shows a brief 0.2-magnitude brightening at 2001.3 ; measured by the stis in both imaging and spectroscopic mode .",
    "it was correlated with the behavior of a strange unidentified emission line near 6307  , and with other subtle changes in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because mid - cycle events have not been predicted in any of the competing scenarios for the 5.5-year cycle .",
    "perhaps the effects seen in 2001 indicate the level of basic , lbv - like fluctuations in @xmath0 car .",
    "the appearance of @xmath0 car and the homunculus nebula has changed dramatically .",
    "twenty years ago the entire object could have been described as `` a bright , compact nebula having an indistinct eighth - magnitude central core ; '' but a few years in the future , if recent trends continue , it will be seen instead as `` a fifth- or even fourth - magnitude star accompanied by some visible nebulosity . ''",
    "meanwhile the color is gradually becoming bluer .",
    "this overall development has long been expected @xcite , but now appears to be occurring 20 years ahead of schedule .",
    "if it signals an irregularity in the star s recovery from the great eruption , then this may be a highly unusual clue to the highly abnormal internal structure .",
    "unsteady diffusion of either the thermal or the rotational parameters would be significant for stellar astrophysics in general .",
    "there are several practical implications for future observations of this object .",
    "valid ground - based spectroscopy of the star ( strictly speaking its wind ) is becoming feasible for the first time , as its increased brightness overwhelms the emission - line contamination by inner ejecta .",
    "unfortunately this implies that the inner ejecta  particularly the mysterious weigelt knots  are becoming difficult to observe .",
    "in fact , since the hst / stis is no longer available , they are now practically impossible to observe .",
    "when some new high - spatial - resolution spectrograph becomes available in the future , the inner ejecta will probably be much fainter than the star .",
    "the expected future of the larger - scale homunculus nebula is also interesting . at present",
    "it is essentially a reflection nebula .",
    "however , based on the presence of high - excitation emission lines such as [ ] close to the star , the system almost certainly contains a source of hydrogen - ionizing photons with energies above 13.6 , and helium - ionizing photons above 25 ev .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ; most recent authors assume that this source is a hot companion star . )",
    "eventually , when circumstellar extinction has decreased sufficiently due to expansion and other effects , the uv source will begin to photoionize the homunculus .",
    "this is especially true if the primary stellar wind is weakening as we conjectured above .",
    "first the inner `` little homunculus '' will become a bright compact region , and then the bipolar homunculus lobes .",
    "the time when that will occur is not obvious , but it may be within the next few decades if current trends continue .",
    "this research was conducted as part of the hst treasury project on @xmath0 carinae via grant no .",
    "go-9973 from the space telescope science institute .",
    "we are grateful to t.r .",
    "gull and beth perriello for assisting with the hst observing plans .",
    "we also especially thank roberta humphreys , j.t . olds , and matt gray at the university of minnesota for discussions and helping with non - routine steps in the data preparation and analysis .",
