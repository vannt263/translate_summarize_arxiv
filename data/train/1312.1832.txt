    "the static properties and dynamical performances of complex network structures have been extensively studied in classical statistical physics @xcite . in the last years",
    "there is a growing interest in fully understanding how these studies can be generalized when dealing with quantum mechanical systems , e.g. with microscopic and fragile quantum coherence affecting macroscopic and robust transport behavior .",
    "very recently , it has been found that quantum effects play a crucial role in the remarkably efficient energy transport phenomena in light - harvesting complexes @xcite , also with a fundamental contribution of the external noisy environment @xcite .",
    "indeed , an electronic exciton seems to behave as a quantum walker over these protein structures , exploiting quantum superposition and interference to enhance its capability to travel from an antenna complex , where light is absorbed , to the reaction center , where this energy is converted into a more available chemical form .",
    "more in general , quantum walks @xcite are becoming more and more popular recently , since they have potential applications , not only in energy transport @xcite , but also , for instance , in quantum information theory @xcite since they may lead to quantum algorithms with polynomial as well exponential speedups @xcite , e.g. grover search algorithm @xcite , universal models for quantum computation @xcite , state transfer in spin and harmonic networks @xcite , noise - assisted quantum communication @xcite , and including also very recent proposals for google page ranking @xcite .",
    "the generalization of classical random walks into the quantum domains had led to different variants , as , mainly , discrete - time quantum walks @xcite , based on an additional action of a quantum ` coin ' , and continuous - time quantum walks obtained , basically , by mapping the classical transfer matrix into a system hamiltonian @xcite ; notice , however , that these two types of walks are shown to be connected by a precise limiting procedure @xcite .    on top of that , this growing interest has been especially stimulated by the increasing number of fascinating and challenging experiments demonstrating the basis features of quantum walks .",
    "they have been implemented , for instance , with nmr @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , neutral atoms @xcite , and several photonic schemes as waveguide structures @xcite , bulk optics @xcite , fiber loop configurations @xcite , and miniaturized integrated waveguide circuits @xcite .",
    "most of these experiments included a single walker moving on a line and , only very recently , they have implemented optical quantum walks on a square lattice by laser pulses @xcite and single photons @xcite .",
    "two - walker experiments on a line have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , motivated also by the fact that the introduction of multiple walkers allows one to map a quantum walk on a line into higher dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "therefore , given these first experimental attempts for higher - dimensional quantum walks , it turns out to be timely and interesting to investigate more in detail the transport features of quantum walkers over large complex networks .",
    "furthermore , motivated by our previous results on noise - enhanced transfer of energy and information over light - harvesting complexes and communication networks @xcite , the additional mixing of quantum features with classical transport behaviour is worthwhile of being deeper understood when varying the underlying ( high - dimensional ) network topology .",
    "a recent study on the comparison of quantum and classical energy transfer , by noisy cellular automata , can be found in ref .",
    "fractal geometries have been also exploited to study the role of the topological structure on quantum transport @xcite and for grover - based searching problems @xcite  for a review on continuous - time quantum walks on complex networks see also ref",
    ". @xcite . concerning the role of decoherence in the mixing time of both discrete- and continuous - time quantum walks , especially for chains , cycles and hypercubes , a review paper is in ref .",
    "moreover , in the context of light - harvesting phenomena , the role of geometry has been also investigated in terms of structure optimization @xcite , in presence of disordered systems @xcite , and to propose design principles for biomimetic structures @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ defs ] we remind the standard formalism of complex networks , that are completely defined by their so - called adjacency matrices and spectral properties @xcite . in particular , one can define statistical measures of distances between nodes in terms of shortest path lengths and the corresponding maximum ( or graph diameter ) , and local properties as clustering coefficient measuring the connectivity of each vertex . in sec .",
    "[ dynam ] , we describe the kossakoski - lindblad formalism of quantum stochastic walks , in terms of well defined master equations , generalizing classical ( random ) and quantum walks by including all possible transition elements from a vertex as given by the connectivity of the graph ( adjacency matrix ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism includes also , a special case , a model showing both classical and quantum walk behaviours as extreme cases and the classical - quantum transition in the other regimes .",
    "our figure of merit for the transport efficiency of each graph is also defined .",
    "after these introductory sections , we investigate this model for a family of large complex networks , comparing the corresponding transport performances  see sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "in particular , we find that the same mixing of classical and quantum behaviours leads to the optimal transfer efficiency for all studied graphs . this widespread behaviour is shown to be very robust when one modifies or deletes some links of the structure .",
    "finally , some conclusions and outlook are discussed in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "here we briefly introduce the main notions of complex networks , together with some well - defined geometric measures , and then the formalism of quantum stochastic walks that has been considered in this paper in order to implement the transport dynamics over these graphs .      the structure of a complex network or graph @xmath0 can be described by a pair @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being a non - empty and finite set whose elements are called vertices ( or nodes ) and @xmath3 being a non - empty set of unordered pairs of vertices , called edges ( or links ) .",
    "let us denote with @xmath4 the number of nodes of the graph @xmath0 , i.e. the number of elements in @xmath2 , and with @xmath5 the number of links or elements of @xmath3 . a graph is completely defined by its adjacency matrix @xmath6 as follows @xmath7_{i , j } : = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{lll }   1 & & \\mbox{if $ \\{v_i , v_j\\}$ $ \\in$ $ e(g)$ } \\\\ \\\\ 0 & & \\mbox{if $ \\{v_i , v_j\\}$ $ \\notin$ $ e(g)$. } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] moreover , if @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath3 , the vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are said to be adjacent or neighbor .",
    "the number of adjacent vertices or neighbors to the vertex @xmath10 is denoted as @xmath12 and is called the degree ( or connectivity ) of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "notice that a graph is said to be regular if each of its nodes has the same degree , i.e. @xmath14 for any @xmath15 . in the following",
    ", we will consider only connected graphs , where there does exist always a path connecting any two nodes , since the unconnected subgraphs or isolated vertices do not play any role for the transport dynamics occurring over the rest of the network .",
    "moreover , we restrict to consider graphs without loops , i.e. without edges of the form @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 for any @xmath15 .",
    "although there are several measures of network topology in literature @xcite , here we focus on the ones that are more related to our study .",
    "first of all , the number of hops from the node @xmath15 to @xmath18 with length @xmath19 equals to @xmath20 . then",
    ", the shortest path length @xmath21 between @xmath15 and @xmath18 is the minimum number of steps ( geodesic lengths ) to go from node @xmath15 to node @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath22 the so - called characteristic path length @xmath23 is hence defined as the average of the shortest paths between all possible pairs of nodes , i.e. @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the total number of node pairs .",
    "furthermore , the largest @xmath21 is defined as the diameter @xmath26 of the graph , that is the largest distance ( or longest , shortest path ) between any two vertices of a graph .",
    "it corresponds also to the the lowest integer @xmath19 for which @xmath27 and @xmath28 if @xmath29 for each couple of nodes @xmath15 and @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath30 note that for any graph @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore this quantity is closely related to the spectral properties of @xmath6 . a well - known theorem in spectral theory of complex networks states , in fact , that the number of distinct eigenvalues @xmath32 of the adjacency matrix @xmath6 is at least equal to @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "on one side , the network with the smallest diameter is the complete or fully connected ( fc ) graph , where one has @xmath35 , since all pairs of nodes are connected through a link .",
    "indeed , the latter is the only graph whose adjacency matrix @xmath6 has only two different eigenvalues ( @xmath36 with degeneracy @xmath37 and @xmath38 with degeneracy @xmath36 ; note that the trace of @xmath6 , and then the sum of its eigenvalues , has to be always @xmath39 ) and the bound above between @xmath26 and @xmath32 is tight . on the other side , for a given number of vertices @xmath4 ,",
    "the linear chain is the topology with the largest diameter ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "finally , another measure of the graph connectivity , known as clustering coefficient @xmath41 , quantifies how well the neighborhood of a node is connected @xcite .",
    "given a node @xmath15 , let us define @xmath42 as its neighborhood , i.e. the graph represented by the set of neighbors of the vertex @xmath15 and the relative interconnecting links . then @xmath43 is the local clustering coefficient of the node @xmath15 and is defined as @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the number of links in @xmath42 and @xmath12 the degree of the node @xmath15 , i.e. it is the ratio of the number of links in @xmath42 ( @xmath45 ) over its maximum possible number ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the ( global ) cluster coefficient @xmath41 of the graph @xmath0 is then given by the average of @xmath43 over all sites @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath47 and it is always in the range @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "once we have introduced the topological structure of our model , we need to specify the corresponding dynamics . to start with ,",
    "let us remind that a random walk is usually defined as a time - discrete process where at each step the walker jumps between two connected nodes of the graph @xmath0 with some probability described by the transition matrix @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "usually , one has @xmath50 for classical random walks , that is indeed called as random walk normalized laplacian matrix .",
    "more specifically , the laplacian matrix @xmath5 is @xmath51 , where @xmath26 is the diagonal matrix of the vertex degrees , i.e. @xmath52 , while @xmath53 .",
    "given the occupation probability distribution @xmath54 of the walker over the nodes @xmath10 at a time @xmath55 , the distribution at time @xmath56 is simply given by @xmath57 .",
    "the time - continuum version of such classical random walk ( crw ) dynamics is then @xmath58    in both cases , the system ends up with a stationary ( unique ) distribution @xmath59 , that is the left - eigenvector of @xmath60 associated to the eigenvalue equal to @xmath37 .",
    "the convergence rate towards the steady state @xmath61 , also known as mixing rate @xmath62 , is proportional to the so - called spectral gap of the graph @xmath0 , that is the difference between the absolute values of the two largest eigenvalues of @xmath6 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , i.e. @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "in other words , the larger the spectral gap is , the faster the walker converges to @xmath61 .",
    "note that one always has @xmath66 and the bound is achieved for the fc graph .",
    "it is well known that well - connected graphs have small diameters and large spectral gaps , implying that the mixing rate @xmath62 is larger ( fast classical random walks ) for graphs with larger @xmath26 . there",
    "do exist several bounds showing that the mixing rate @xmath62 does monotonically increase with @xmath26 , apart from some constants .    in order to study the transport properties of such networks including also quantum coherence effects",
    ", we use the general framework of continuous - time quantum stochastic walks ( qsw ) @xcite , based on the kossakowski - lindblad master equation , allowing us to interpolate between classical random walks ( crw ) and quantum walks ( qw ) @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the evolution of our initial state , represented by the density operator @xmath67 , follows : @xmath68 + p \\sum_{i j } \\left(l_{i j } \\rho { l}^{\\dagger}_{i j } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\{{l}^{\\dagger}_{i j } l_{i j } , \\rho \\ } \\right ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the hamiltonian describing the quantum coherent dynamics , while the operators @xmath70 are responsible for the irreversibility . note the parameter @xmath71 $ ] quantifying the interplay between coherent ( unitary ) dynamics and incoherent ( irreversible ) one . in order to match with the limit of usual crws by choosing @xmath72",

    "( [ crw ] ) for the diagonal elements of @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath75 . on the other side , @xmath76 corresponds to the pure qw master equation , where we choose @xmath77 .",
    "this corresponds to a simplified model of a system ( for instance , a light - harvesting complex ) , where all the energies and couplings are the same ( homogeneous graphs ) @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the presence of losses and we restrict to the case where only one excitation is present in the network . note that this formalism has been also used in a different context to propose a more efficient quantum navigation algorithm to rank elements of large ( google page ) networks @xcite . to study the transfer efficiency of the qsw over the complex network @xmath0 , on the right - side of eq .",
    "( [ qsrws ] ) we add another lindblad term @xmath78 $ ] , with @xmath79 being the irreversible transfer rate from the site @xmath4 of the graph into some external node @xmath80 ( trapping site or sink ) where the energy is continuously and irreversibly stored .",
    "hence , the transfer efficiency of the graph will be measured by @xcite @xmath81 hence , our figure of merit will be : @xmath82 \\ ; \\text{with } \\ ; { \\cal e}(\\bar{p},\\bar{t } ) \\simeq 1 \\ ; , \\ ] ] usually corresponding to take @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the strength of the coupling rates , i.e. considering the trapping site population after the initial transient behavior .",
    "in the following we will investigate the model described above for a large class of complex networks , including up to thousands of nodes , comparing the relative transfer efficiency @xmath85 .     as a function of @xmath86 for qsws on a linear chain of @xmath87 nodes .",
    "different initial conditions are considered , while the sink is always connected to the site @xmath88 .",
    "note that @xmath85 appears to be rising again towards @xmath72 , perhaps because the coherent dynamics tends to be frozen ( quantum zeno effect ) in presence of very strong irreversibility but the transport is recovered again at the classical limit .",

    "if it is on the center site of the chain , the efficiency becomes optimal at the value of @xmath92 .",
    "this does hold also when we average @xmath85 over any possible initial site ",
    "[ fig1 ] for a chain with @xmath87 .",
    "the same optimal value is also found for longer chains , although the scaling of @xmath89 with @xmath4 ( at time @xmath90 linearly proportional to @xmath4 ) does depend on @xmath86 and shows a stronger @xmath4dependence ( i.e. less robustness ) in the classical limit ",
    "see inset of fig .",

    "@xcite , but here we follow a slightly different algorithm allowing us to keep fixed the degree of each vertex as in ref . @xcite .",
    "we start from a regular square lattice and we randomly choose a vertex @xmath106 and the edge @xmath107 that connects vertex @xmath106 to its nearest neighbor @xmath108 , at random .",

    "connecting @xmath110 to @xmath112 , and ( b ) we replace the couple of edges @xmath107 and @xmath111 with the couple @xmath113 and @xmath114 , as in the inset of fig .",
    "this process is repeated by moving over the entire lattice considering each vertex in turn until one lap is completed . in such a way",

    "strictly speaking , the characteristic path length @xmath97 of the rewired graph decreases while increasing @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can use the term `` small - world '' to refer to a rewired lattice ( with fixed degree ) with the minimum number of rewired edges such that the characteristic path length @xmath97 is as small as that one for the corresponding random graph ( with @xmath97 depending at most logarithmically on the network size @xmath4 ) , but the cluster coefficient @xmath41 is still as high as for a regular lattice , i.e. much larger than @xmath41 for random networks @xcite .",

    "the latter are defined as set of eigenstates of the hamiltonian that are orthogonal with the site connected to the sink , i.e. they are not affected by the open - system dynamics and their evolution is purely coherent and described by just a global phase .",
    "these invariant ( trapped ) states can be systematically found for any network with some degeneracy , as geometrical symmetries corresponding to large degenerate eigenspaces , and the more they are , the larger is the amount of energy trapped in the system .",
    "hence , a fc graph ( @xmath35 and @xmath136 ) is the worst geometry for qws ; indeed , because of destructive interference effects and the presence of as large as possible invariant subspace , the transfer efficiency @xmath137 can not be larger than @xmath138 @xcite",
    ". however , by means of a universal mixing ( @xmath92 ) of , loosely speaking , @xmath139 of qws and @xmath140 of crws , the invariant ( trapped ) subspaces are destroyed and the energy transport becomes optimal and robust , and , in particular , we find that this is irrespective of the particular underlying geometry of the complex network .",
    "in this paper we extensively investigate the transport properties of quantum stochastic walks over a wide family of large complex networks .",
    "more specifically , we numerically calculate and compare the transport performances of these graphs by the transfer efficiency of a trapping site , also motivated by the structure of light - harvesting complexes where the interplay of quantum coherence and environmental noise has been recently shown to play a fundamental role in explaining the remarkably efficient as well fast exciton energy transfer .",
    "we find that , roughly speaking , the mixing of @xmath139 of quantum dynamics and @xmath140 of classical one , i.e. for @xmath92 , leads to optimal transport efficiency . on top of that , this optimal behaviour is not only relatively common on very different networks but also robust with respect to geometric changes as rewiring or deleting links .",
    "however , there are some exceptions represented by very well connected graphs ( e.g. , fcs and graphs with @xmath141 ) , where instead classical random walks , i.e. @xmath72 , provide the optimal transport into the trapping site .",
    "this might be a consequence of the fact that for such graphs there are many trapped states due to destructive interference ( large invariant subspaces almost covering the full hilbert space @xcite ) , that are fully destroyed only at the classical limit .",
    "the transition behaviour from @xmath72 to @xmath92 when making the network less and less connected ( @xmath142 ) , and a deeper analysis of this widespread and robust optimality , also based on a possible analytical derivation by means of lieb - robinson bounds @xcite , will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "finally , our results could be tested through already experimentally available benchmark platforms as cold atoms in optical lattices , artificial light - harvesting structures , and photonics - based architectures , hence also inspiring the design of optimally efficient transport nanostructures for novel solar energy and information quantum - based technologies .",
