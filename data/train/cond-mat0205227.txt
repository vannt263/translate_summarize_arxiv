    "we consider the classical two - dimensional antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model on a triangular lattice ( tafxy ) . this frustrated 2@xmath14 spin system has received much attention during the last decade@xcite .",
    "the tafxy model displays rich low - temperature phase structures and critical phenomena because frustration introduces additional discrete symmetries resulting from the chiral degrees of freedom .",
    "the ground states of this model are composed of three interpenetrating sublattices with lattice vectors of length @xmath15 .",
    "spins on each sublattice are ferromagnetically ordered and spins on different sublattices are oriented @xmath16 with respect to each other .",
    "the tafxy has a continuous u(1 ) symmetry associated with global spin rotations and a discrete @xmath17 symmetry because of the double degeneracy of the ground - state chirality configurations .",
    "this model has two order parameters : the staggered in - plane magnetization and the staggered chirality .",
    "there have been ongoing controversies concerning phase transitions and the nature of the phase transitions .",
    "some@xcite suggested that the system undergoes a single phase transition , generally yielding non - ising critical exponent ; however , others@xcite supported a double phase transition scenario with a kosterlitz - thouless(kt)-like transition followed by a second - order chirality - lattice melting transition at a slightly higher temperature .",
    "in addition to spin waves and vortices , which are fundamental excitations in the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model on a bipartite lattice , the triangular antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model has another excitations associated with domain - wall formation between two different ground states in view of the chirality configuration of ground states@xcite .",
    "a good experimental realization of the frustrated antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model on a stacked triangular lattice is abx@xmath13 type halides ( like csnicl@xmath13 , csmnbr@xmath13 , cscucl@xmath13)@xcite .",
    "the magnetic b@xmath18 ions form a triangular antiferromagnet within the @xmath19 planes and a ferromagnetic coupling along the @xmath20 direction produces three dimensional order .    while the static critical behavior of the tafxy model has been the subject of much interest during the last decade , the theoretical study of dynamic critical behavior has not been carried out for the tafxy model .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the dynamic behavior of the tafxy model using monte carlo and spin - dynamic methods(mc - sd ) .",
    "although in the usual planar @xmath0 model each spin has two components , here we use the three - component @xmath0 model in order to study the real dynamics .",
    "these two models belong to the same static universality class@xcite , but the planar @xmath0 model will not have true dynamical behavior.@xcite    the estimates for @xmath5 and @xmath9 used here are taken from a recent high - precision mc study where the critical temperature @xmath9 associated with the chirality phase transition and the kt transition temperature @xmath5 associated with unbinding of vortex pairs have been determined as @xmath9 = 0.412(5)@xmath21 and @xmath5 = 0.403(1)@xmath21.@xcite",
    "we will first briefly describe the model and the numerical method used here and show how the dynamic structure factor is computed .",
    "the classical antiferromagnetic @xmath0 model is described by the following form :    @xmath22    where the summation is over all nearest neighbors , @xmath23 = @xmath24 is a three - dimensional classical spin of unit length at site @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the positive ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling constant between nearest - neighbor pairs of spins .",
    "we consider triangular lattices of size @xmath27 along the primitive vector directions(@xmath28 , containing @xmath29 = @xmath30 sites and @xmath31 elementary triangles . in our calculations ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied along the primitive vector directions .",
    "we use a hybrid monte carlo procedure which consists of a combination of the metropolis update@xcite and the over - relaxation algorithm@xcite ( see also ref . 18 ) .",
    "one hybrid monte carlo step consists of two metropolis and eight over - relaxation updates@xcite . using this hybrid algorithm",
    ", we generated approximately 700 - 8500 equilibrium configurations at a given temperature .",
    "typically 1000 hybrid monte carlo steps were used to generate each equilibrium configuration , which is then evolved using the equations of motion given by :    @xmath32    starting from a particular initial spin configuration , we performed numerical integration of these equations of motion using a recently developed 4th - order suzuki - trotter decomposition method@xcite , and the integration is carried out to a maximum time @xmath33 , typically of the order of @xmath34 = 680 and @xmath35 = 600 , with a time step of @xmath36 = 0.2@xmath37 .",
