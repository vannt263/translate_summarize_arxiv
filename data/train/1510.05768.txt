    "supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) comprise a unique and varied class of objects , first identified more than two decades ago by the einstein observatory ( heao-2 ) .",
    "close binary ssss are characterized by significant emission in the 0.30.7 kev spectral band resembling the wien tail of a blackbody , with @xmath8 @xmath9 210 @xmath10 and estimated @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 erg / s @xcite .",
    "if such high temperatures and luminosities are typical of the majority of their accretion lifetimes ( @xmath14yrs ) , then these objects should strongly ionize any surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , producing characteristic emission - line nebulae @xcite .",
    "however , to date only one such nebula ( cal 83 ) has been identified @xcite . in the absence of a compelling reason for all other ssss to be surrounded by a more rarefied ism than cal 83 , the lack of high - ionization nebulae accompanying other known sources would imply an extremely low duty - cycle for these objects @xcite . at present",
    "there is little understanding as to how either possibility would come about .",
    "this uncertainty has remained unresolved over the last two decades .",
    "several varieties of accreting compact objects are thought to undergo a super - soft or quasi - soft x - ray emitting state , including accreting black holes and post - outburst novae . among the most common objects in this class ,",
    "at least as found in the magellanic clouds @xcite , are the so - called close - binary ssss . in the classic picture @xcite ,",
    "close - binary ssss are white dwarfs ( wds ) accreting hydrogen - rich matter from a main sequence or red giant companion , with steady nuclear burning of the accreted hydrogen at the wd s surface .",
    "this steady nuclear burning is only possible for mass transfer rates within a narrow range ( 1  few @xmath15 @xmath16yr , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for accretion rates less than this , nuclear - burning proceeds only in unsteady bursts , giving rise to novae .",
    "the upper bound is approximately given by the accretion rate at which a wd has the same nuclear - burning luminosity as an agb star with the equivalent core mass . above this threshold ,",
    "the observational appearance is extremely uncertain .",
    "one possibility is that the photosphere of the wd will once more swell up to the thermal equilibrium radius of a giant ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , dynamical processes , such as an optically - thick wind driven from within the photosphere , may modulate mass transfer before this can happen , with photospheric temperatures in the range 12 @xmath15 @xmath17 @xcite for @xmath18/yr .",
    "apart from simply understanding their phenomenology , close - binary ssss have come under particular scrutiny as candidates for the progenitors of thermonuclear ( type ia ) supernovae ( sne ia ) . in the so - called single degenerate channel @xcite ,",
    "a carbon - oxygen wd accretes hydrogen - rich material as described above until reaching the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath19 ) , triggering a thermonuclear runaway ( although both lower and higher explosion masses may be possible , see * ? ? ?",
    "a considerable body of evidence has accumulated in the past several years demonstrating that such sources can not be the progenitors of sne ia , or , should the sd scenario still hold , that accreting wd progenitors can not manifest themselves as ssss for the majority of their accretion phase @xcite .",
    "such arguments were predicated on the notion that steadily nuclear - burning sources with radii typical of massive wds should emit strongly in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath20@xmath21k ) , producing detectable emission where the intervening column density is low ( e.g. along many lines of sight in the magellanic clouds , m31 , and nearby early - type galaxies ) .",
    "however , for lower wd masses ( m @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or in case of considerable inflation of the photosphere above that expected from the wd mass  radius relation @xcite , the temperature may fall below @xmath23k .",
    "this would shift the majority of the nuclear - burning luminosity to the extreme - uv , where it could not be directly detected .",
    "however , such objects should remain very strong sources of ionizing radiation @xcite , with no cut - off at the h i or he ii ionization edges @xcite .",
    "one can then demonstrate that , in the single degenerate scenario , accreting nuclear - burning wds must produce an enormous combined ionizing luminosity , easily sufficient to dominate the ionizing background in many early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "given that many early - type galaxies possess extended emission - line regions powered by the continuum from their old stellar populations , we should then be able to detect emission lines characteristic of ionization by high - temperature sources , such as he ii 4686  and [ o i ] 6300 .",
    "following on this , @xcite produced carefully - selected stacks of early - type galaxies with emission - lines in the sdss , and found a he ii 4686 / h@xmath24 ratio ( @xmath98% ) consistent with @xmath25% contribution from any high - temperature ( @xmath26@xmath27k ) sources for galaxies with luminosity - weighted mean stellar ages in the range 1gyr @xmath28 t @xmath28 4gyr .",
    "similar constraints from the [ o i ] 6300  line extend this limit up to t @xmath29k sd progenitors ( johansson et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "note that at these high temperatures ( exceeding @xmath30 ) , the contribution of accreting wds is also very tightly constrained in soft x - rays ( @xmath311% * ? ? ?",
    "in order to remain consistent with the observational constraints discussed above , the average mass accreted per wd in any `` hot mode '' ( @xmath8 @xmath32k ) by sd progenitors is limited to @xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "however , accreting wds may remain viable as the progenitors of at least some sne ia if they accrete principally at lower temperatures .",
    "indeed , known ssss are understood to undergo considerable variability , with many interchanging between optical - low / x - ray - on ( hot ) and optical - high / x - ray - off ( cold ) states .",
    "searches for nebulae surrounding ssss in the magellanic clouds have detected only one , cal 83 @xcite , which itself has proven difficult to model @xcite .",
    "this implies that either the density of the ism surrounding other ssss is much less than that in the vicinity of cal 83 (",
    "n @xmath12 4  10@xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or that these sources do not radiate at high temperatures for the majority of their accretion history . for close - binary ssss , this would be in keeping with the possibility that accreting , nuclear - burning wds may still be a strong candidate for the progenitors of sne ia .    here , we briefly review the physics of ionized nebulae surrounding high - temperature and variable sources in @xmath35[sss_stromgren ] , and provide detailed predictions for the observable characteristics of such nebulae in very low - density media .",
    "we then discuss the meaning of the apparent absence of sss nebulae in the magellanic clouds in @xmath35[ssss_mcs ] .",
    "we revisit the upper limits placed by @xcite , which do not constrain the temperature / luminosity of ssss in low - density media ( @xmath36 @xmath12 0.1  1@xmath5 ) .",
    "we demonstrate however that such densities are typical of the warm - neutral / warm - ionized ism , in which most ssss are expected to be located . based on the current understanding of the structure of the interstellar medium in star - forming galaxies ,",
    "we compute the probability of finding a source in the vicinity of a cold and neutral cloud big enough to be detected by the @xcite survey in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "we then outline the requirements for a survey which can provide a more complete census of sss nebulae in the magellanic clouds in @xmath35[prospects ] , and place this in the context of the only observed sss nebula , as well as two candidate nebulae in m33 . before closing",
    ", we briefly discuss the plausibility and implications of a large , heretofore undiscovered ionizing source population for stellar feedback and the evolution of the ism in @xmath35[implications ] .",
    "the notion of emission - line nebulae ionized by ssss was first explored by @xcite .",
    "they identified several tell - tale signatures which would allow for the identification of such objects , namely pronounced [ o iii ] 5007 , [ o i ] 6300 , and he ii 4686  emission , similar to the most luminous planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "however , contrary to pne , these would be very extended objects , with typical str \" omgren radii :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the ionizing photon luminosity of the source , and @xmath36 is the density of the surrounding ism . in practice ,",
    "nebulae ionized by high - temperature sources extend to somewhat larger radii than even this , as high energy photons penetrate deeper into the neutral ism , yielding a broad interface at the str \" omgren boundary ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ ionization_structure ] ) . such nebulae may be resolved even by ground - based telescopes out to distances of a few mpc .",
    "emission - line surveys represent an attractive alternative to searching for ssss directly for a variety of reasons @xcite .",
    "while soft - band ( @xmath9 0.30.7kev ) x - ray sources may be completely obscured by relatively modest column densities ( @xmath3 few@xmath39 ) , optical emission - line nebulae typically suffer only slight reddening .",
    "the most [ o iii ] 5007- and he ii 4686 - luminous nebulae should also be those ionized by relatively low - temperature wds ( @xmath915@xmath40k ) , probing the sss population in the temperature regime least sensitive to soft x - ray observations @xcite .     respectively . in both cases ,",
    "we assume ionization by a central blackbody source with temperature 5@xmath0k and bolometric luminosity @xmath41erg / s .",
    "note that we terminate our calculations when the temperature of the gas falls below 3000k . ]    furthermore , if the progenitors of some sne ia do undergo a sss phase , any nebula ionized by the accreting wd will remain for    @xmath42    after the end of this phase , potentially providing a test of the progenitors of relatively young ( t @xmath31 @xmath43 ) , nearby sn ia remnants long after their explosion ( i.e. without the need for pre - supernova images , as in * ? ? ?",

    "assuming an isothermal disk for the lmc , they then find a scale height of @xmath49 @xmath9 0.18 kpc . from this , we can make an estimate of the _ mean _ density of the neutral ism along any line of sight @xmath50 from the relation :    @xmath51    where the factor @xmath52 accounts for the fact that the disk is not face - on ( the lmc is in fact inclined at @xmath53 , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we begin by considering the distribution of h i cloud sizes in the magellanic system . summing the total area of any contiguous h i structure connected in ra , dec , and velocity in the lmc , and identifying the square root of this area as the appropriate length scale , @xcite find a distribution of h i cloud sizes which follows a roughly power - law distribution :    @xmath73    from kpc scales down to the minimum resolution of their survey ( @xmath9 15pc ) , and with larger values of @xmath74 for lower flux - limits .",

    "indeed , the sd scenario for the progenitors of sne ia suggests a large number of such objects , and present population synthesis calculations suggest the sd scenario may account for a significant fraction of the sn ia rate observed at early delay - times , and in galaxies with vigorous ongoing star - formation ( in the latter , perhaps @xmath134 at @xmath135 gyr , see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we can make an estimate of the total h@xmath45 luminosity this may produce ( if no ionizing photons escape ) , assuming case b recombination in the low - density limit , with a ( typical ) gas temperature of @xmath144k @xcite .",
    "this gives us a predicted h@xmath45 luminosity of 13@xmath145erg / s , roughly 1030% of the total diffuse h@xmath45 luminosity of the lmc ( i.e. , excluding that immediately associated with resolved h ii regions , * ? ? ?",
    "this fraction of the total non - h ii region h@xmath45 emission is comparable to the `` truly diffuse '' h@xmath45 luminosity found by @xcite , which is not associated with either filamentary structures , or the diffuse flux within supergiant shells .",
    "therefore , understanding the long - term variability of ssss may be a question of vital importance to the study of the structure of the ism in star - forming galaxies .",
    "the few observed ssss in the lmc have a combined luminosity that is less than 1% of the value suggested by eq .",

    "for this reason these results must be considered to be accurate to within a factor of a few . strictly speaking the current sensitivity at any point in the mcs would vary , and depends on the exposure times of all observations taken up to the present time . in order to compute the observed count rate",

    "also shown are results from the 1d steady - burning wd models of @xcite .",

    "[ detecting_ssss ] with the typical mc column densities in fig .",
    "[ hi_mcs ] .",
    "note that while most population synthesis models do not predict a dominant sd channel in the production of sne ia @xcite , they do predict a large number of low - mass accreting , nuclear - burning wds nonetheless .",
    "in star - forming galaxies , recent population synthesis calculations indicate the total luminosity of _ all _ accreting , nuclear - burning wds could provide a significant source of ionizing radiation , although it is substantially below the estimate given above for the luminosity of a putative sd progenitor population @xcite . by far the majority of accreting nuclear - burning wds",
    "should lie at lower masses ( 0.6@xmath69@xmath149 ) , most of which should still remain undetected in the mcs ( see fig .",

    "searching for nebulae ionized by accreting wds may be the only way to observationally investigate this further .",
    "the above considerations , together with the relatively low ionization state of helium in the ism , suggest nuclear - burning wds likely play a relatively minor role in the overall ionization balance of diffuse interstellar gas ( the `` dig '' ) .    however",
    ", even if ssss are not a major component of the diffuse ionizing background in star - forming galaxies , they may play a role in the high [ o iii]/h@xmath24 ratios seen in the low - density ( n@xmath310.1@xmath5 ) ism @xcite . in particular , it appears that some heretofore unknown mechanism is needed to account for the additional heating ( @xmath150 erg / s/@xmath5 ) inferred in the diffuse ism well above the midplane @xcite .",
    "nuclear - burning wds could naturally account for such a hardening of the ionizing continuum , should their numbers and distribution with scale height prove appropriate .",
    "this would require considerable further investigation before any definitive statement can be made .",
    "given the high escape fraction , nuclear - burning wds may also provide a component of the apparently `` missing '' contribution to the cosmic ionizing photon background from galaxies at low redshift @xcite , as well as contributing to the heating balance of the hot coronal gas ( s. cantalupo , private communication ) .",
    "in particular , ionization of he ii ( an important coolant in the hot ism ) by nuclear - burning wds may keep the gas sufficiently hot so as to provide an additional component of stellar feedback .",

    "two decades after the discovery of ssss , the long - term behaviour of accreting , nuclear - burning wds remains poorly understood .",

    "this problem has lingered without resolution since the survey of @xcite .",
    "while it remains possible that our understanding of the long - term behaviour of ssss is incorrect , in this work we have demonstrated that most ssss must lie in much lower density ism than does cal 83 .",
    "in particular , for our simple model we showed that for the six known close - binary ssss in the lmc , the likelihood that no more than one source lies sufficiently near to a dense cloud to produce a nebula which could have been previously detectable is @xmath9 70% .",
    "this probability has been computed based on the current understanding of the structure of interstellar medium in star forming galaxies .",
    "therefore , given the current state of the observational evidence there is no reason to conclude that ssss have in general a much lower duty cycle than presently inferred .",
    "we then outlined the prospects for a future survey which may be able to reveal all bright ssss in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the outcome of such a study carries important consequences regardless of the outcome .",
    "if no enhancement in [ o iii ] 5007  emission is seen in the vicinity of known ssss , with limiting surface brightnesses of @xmath156erg / s/@xmath62/@xmath125 , then these objects are not well - described by our present understanding of accretion onto nuclear - burning wds .",
