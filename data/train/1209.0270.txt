    "triggered by the first data taking of x and gamma satellites , as well as by the improved capabilities of radio telescopes and high and ultra - high gamma ray detectors , there has been in the last ten years an impressive accumulation of observational data on supernova and neutron stars in different environments and at different evolution stages . among the most important recent results one should mention the precise measurement of a very massive two solar - mass neutron star  @xcite which challenges a number of theoretical equations of state of dense matter , and the measurement of the cooling curve of the young pulsar cassiopeia a  @xcite , which gives strong constraints on the super - fluid properties of neutron star cores .",
    "understanding these data requires a good modelization of the supernova dynamics and of the formation process of neutron stars  @xcite , but also a precise and detailed control of the relevant microphysics .",
    "sophisticated two and three - dimensional core - collapse supernova simulations show that matter in the supernova core explores a very large interval of baryonic densities , ranging from about @xmath0 g @xmath1 @xmath2 to several times the normal nuclear density @xmath3 , temperatures between some hundreds of kev and around 80 mev , and proton fractions between @xmath4 0.5 and @xmath5 0.1 .",
    "different microscopic properties of nuclear matter in these wide thermodynamic conditions are of influence for these astrophysical phenomena . in particular , the core - collapse gravitational models show an important influence of the explosion mechanism with respect to the equation of state . to give an example , the explosion of very massive 15 solar - mass progenitors can presently only be achieved with a so - called `` soft '' equation of state .    in the whole sub - saturation region matter",
    "is not uniform but it is constituted of finite nuclei , with a dominance of exotic neutron - rich isotopes",
    ". therefore a reliable calculation of the abundances of these nuclei is essential , as well as a knowledge of their mass , level densities and in - medium self - energy modifications .",
    "another key aspect concerns the thermal energy evacuation during the explosion and the proto - neutron star cooling . in the first evolution stage",
    ", heat is evacuated essentially by electron capture processes followed by neutrino emission .",
    "it is therefore very important to control the associated electro - weak processes , namely the electron capture rates and the neutrino interactions with the dense matter and the different nuclei of the proto - neutron star crust .",
    "both the equation of state and the neutrino cross sections are strongly influenced by the possible presence of phase transitions in dense matter .",
    "in particular , first - order phase transitions lead to a softening of the baryonic pressure , while second order phase transitions lead to a dramatic increase of the electroweak interaction probability  @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "a control of the phase diagram of stellar matter is of importance in our understanding of these complex astrophysical process .    in this contribution",
    ", we will limit ourselves to the thermodynamic conditions where matter can be described by nucleonic or hadronic degrees of freedom and will examine two phase transitions which are expected to play a role in supernova physics , namely the crust - core phase transition at sub - saturation density and the possible phase transition towards strange matter at super - saturation density .",
    "since the early days of the equation of state modelization it was clearly recognized that , because of the strong similarities between the effective nucleon - nucleon potential and molecular interactions , the phase diagram of diluted nuclear matter should present a first - order phase transition of the liquid - gas type , terminating at high temperature and density in a critical point  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been confirmed in all phenomenological  @xcite or microscopic  @xcite modelizations of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter with realistic effective interactions compatible with recent nuclear data . in these calculations ,",
    "nuclear matter is defined as an idealized bulk medium of neutrons and protons where the electromagnetic interaction is artificially switched off in order to achieve a thermodynamic limit . in the physical situation of stellar matter ,",
    "however , charge neutrality is achieved by the screening effect of electrons on the proton charge . because of the very different mass between electrons and protons , the compressibility of electron and proton matter is very different , which induces coulomb effects that drastically modify the liquid - gas phase transition associated to uncharged nuclear matter .",
    "specifically , in all density and temperature conditions relevant for neutron star physics , the electron charge can be safely considered as uniformly distributed  @xcite .",
    "this means that any baryonic density fluctuation ( which is correlated to a proton density fluctuation because of the repulsive symmetry energy ) induces a fluctuation in the electric charge .",
    "a well known consequence of the resulting coulomb correlations is that the low density phase at zero temperature is not a gas , but a wigner crystal of nuclei immersed in the homogeneous electron background  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that such coulomb effects do not disappear with increasing density and temperature , and it is a - priori not evident that a phenomenology equivalent to the one calculated for uncharged nuclear matter might at all be observed .",
    "however , guided by the uncharged nuclear matter example , the standard treatments currently used in most supernovae codes describe the dilute stellar matter at finite temperature in the baryonic sector as a statistical equilibrium between protons , neutrons , alphas and a single heavy nucleus representing the finite system counterpart of the liquid fraction  @xcite .",
    "the transition to homogeneous matter in the neutron star core is supposed to be first - order in these modelizations and obtained through a maxwell construction in the total density at fixed proton fraction .    from the nuclear physics side it is well recognized that , since stellar matter is subject to the contrasting couplings of the electromagnetic and the strong interaction acting on comparable length scales because of the electron screening , this should give rise to the phenomenon of frustration  @xcite , well - known in condensed matter physics  @xcite . because of this",

    "the instability of such matter with respect to a density fluctuation can be studied by considering the free energy variation once independent proton , neutron , and electron fluctuations @xmath7 @xmath8 are imposed in a given thermodynamic condition defined by a density , temperature , and proton fraction .",
    "this variation in the three - dimensional space of density fluctuations @xmath9 reads  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the free - energy curvature matrix .",
    "an instability against matter clusterization corresponds to a negative free - energy curvature in the space of density fluctuations .",
    "it is studied through the @xmath12-dependent curvature matrix @xmath13 . a negative eigenvalue associated to a given wavelength signals that a fluctuation characterized by the associated eigenvector will be spontaneously amplified , giving rise to cluster formation if the wavelength is finite , or phase separation for infinite wavelengths .",
    "this smallest eigenvalue @xmath14 is shown as a function of the wave number in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we can see that the eigenvalue is positive at k=0 , meaning that the phase transition is quenched and replaced by cluster formation in stellar matter .",
    "this coulomb frustration effect has been confirmed by different microscopic models  @xcite . a continuous evolution from the coulomb lattice to a homogeneous nuclear fluid , passing through the formation of clusters of different sizes and strongly deformed dis - homogeneous structures close to the saturation density has been reported , both at zero and at finite temperature .",
    "these calculations are numerically very heavy and a complete thermodynamic characterization of stellar matter under the frustrated phase transition has not been done yet .",
    "such a task can however be performed in the phenomenological so - called nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) approaches , which treat the bound states of nucleons as new species of quasi - particles  @xcite .      within nse , the baryonic component of the stellar matter is regarded as a statistical equilibrium of neutrons and protons , the electric charge of the latter being screened by a homogeneous electron background . as a first approximation",
    ", one can consider that the system of interacting nucleons is equivalent to a system of non - interacting clusters , with the nuclear interaction being completely exhausted by clusterization .",
    "this simple model can describe only diluted matter at @xmath15 as it can be found in the outer crust of neutron stars , while nuclear interaction among nucleons and clusters has to be included for applications at higher density , when the average inter - particle distance becomes comparable to the range of the force .",
    "a simple possibility  @xcite is to take into account interactions among composite clusters in the simplified form of a hard - sphere excluded volume , and interactions among nucleons in the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation with a phenomenological realistic energy functional fitted on a large number of measured mass and radii . in this version of the model , the thermodynamics",

    "@xcite . ]    the thermodynamics of the extended nse model is presented in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "we can see that the equation of state does not present any plateau as it would have been the case for a first - order phase transition .",
    "more surprising , the entropy presents a convex intruder , the behavior of the equation of state is not monotonic and a clear back - bending is observed , qualitatively similar to the phenomenon observed in phase transitions in finite systems  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to remark that similar behaviors , with non - monotonic equations of state and discontinuities in the intensive variables , are systematically observed in phase transitions with long - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the back - bending in the equation of state is that this unusual thermodynamics can only be observed in the canonical ensemble where the density is controlled . indeed",
    "if the baryon chemical potential was controlled as it is the case in standard nse , in the region of the back - bending the multiple evaluation of the chemical potential would lead to keep only the solution of minimal free energy .",

    "indeed if the grandcanonical phase coexistence solution was the preferred response at equilibrium inside the in - equivalence region , such solution would have been found in a canonical calculation where the coexistence density is imposed . on the contrary ,",
    "once the density is fixed , a dis - homogeneous clusterized solution is found in agreement with the expected phenomenology associated to the coulomb frustration .",
    "this is demonstrated in the left part of figure [ fig9 ] , which shows the cluster distribution in the in - equivalence region . as a function of the density",
    ", the average cluster size is continuously changing and can never be assimilated to a portion of the fluid phase .",
    "the right part of the same figure compares the grandcanonical and canonical cluster distribution in a thermodynamic situation relevant for supernova physics .",
    "we can see that accounting for the correct thermodynamics has important consequences on the matter composition .",
    "since the cluster abundances determine the electron capture rate , which in turn is a capital ingredient for the size of the homologous core and the cooling process , it is clear that a control of the phase diagram is important for supernova physics .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the most probable abundances concern not so neutron - rich nuclei which are potentially accessible in laboratory experiments : a detailed knowledge of the mass , level density and electron capture cross section for these nuclei is thus needed to have a reliable description of the equation of state .      in the extended nse model presented in the previous section clusters",
    "are treated as an ideal gas characterized by an empirical energy functional which is modified with respect to nuclei in the vacuum only through the excluded volume mechanism .",

    "specifically , backbendings are observed in the equations of state which can not be correctly evaluated in the grandcanonical ensemble but require a canonical evaluation of the partition sum .    in the supersaturation regime",
    ", we have used the same mean field approximation with effective phenomenological energy functionals in order to describe the characteristics of the phase diagram in the presence of strangeness .",
    "we have shown that already a simple system composed of neutrons and @xmath59 hyperons in thermal equilibrium presents a complex phase diagram with first and second order phase transitions .",
    "some of these phase transitions are probably never explored in physical systems .",
    "however , a possible phase transition at super - saturation baryon densities , from non - strange to strange matter is expected to be observed both in the inner core of neutron star and in the dense regions of core - collapse supernova . for this latter phenomenology ,",
    "a critical point is predicted and the associated critical opalescence could have an impact on supernova dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the immediate consequence of that is that the opening of hyperon channels at high density should not be viewed as a continuous ( though abrupt ) increase of strangeness in the matter , observed in many models of hyperonic matter , cf e.g.  @xcite , but rather as the coexistence of hyperon - poor and hyperon - rich macroscopic domains .",
    "an extension of this simple model to include all possible hyperons and resonances is in progress .",

    "<S> dense matter as it can be found in core - collapse supernovae and neutron stars is expected to exhibit different phase transitions which impact the matter composition and equation of state , with important consequences on the dynamics of core - collapse supernova explosion and on the structure of neutron stars . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will address the specific phenomenology of two of such transitions , namely the crust - core solid - liquid transition at sub - saturation density , and the possible strange transition at super - saturation density in the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the neutron star crust - core phase transition at zero and finite temperature , it will be shown that , as a consequence of the presence of long - range coulomb interactions , the equivalence of statistical ensembles is violated and a clusterized phase is expected which is not accessible in the grand - canonical ensemble . a specific quasi - particle model will be introduced to illustrate this anomalous thermodynamics and some quantitative results relevant for the supernova dynamics will be shown . the opening of hyperonic degrees of freedom at higher densities corresponding to the neutron stars core modifies the equation of state.the general characteristics and order of phase transitions in this regime will be analyzed in the framework of a self - consistent mean - field approach . </S>"
