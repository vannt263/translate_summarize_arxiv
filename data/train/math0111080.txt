    "in the standard phase retrieval problem one has available the modulus of the fourier transform of an  object \" , usually in two or three dimensions , and a set of _ a priori _ constraints that a proper fourier reconstruction of the object must satisfy .",
    "usually one assumes that , up to translation and inversion of the object , the reconstruction is unique . in other words , there is essentially a unique set of phases that , when combined with the known fourier modulus data , satisfy all the _ a priori _ constraints .",
    "it is in this sense that the unknown phases are said to be  retrieved \" from the modulus data .",
    "currently there are no practical algorithms for phase retrieval , that is , procedures where a solution is guaranteed at a computational cost that grows modestly with the size of the problem .",
    "rather , a number of heuristic strategies have been developed that in many situations perform very well .",
    "a dominant theme of these practical methods is an iteration scheme which modifies the object in each cycle until both the fourier moduli are correct and all the _ a priori _ constraints are satisfied .",
    "although nothing has been proven about the rate of convergence of such schemes , the body of favorable empirical evidence in both imaging@xcite and crystallographic@xcite applications is substantial .",
    "expressed in the most general terms , phase retrieval is the problem of finding an element in a large set that simultaneously has properties @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc .",
    ", given only the ability to find elements having these properties separately . if property @xmath2 corresponds to the object having the correct fourier modulus , property @xmath3 might represent , for example , a support constraint .",
    "while it is very easy to construct objects having the correct fourier modulus , or a prescribed support , there are no known methods for directly constructing an object ( if one exists ) that has both properties . accepting this basic limitation , we can nevertheless attempt to build the desired construction using the simple constructions for properties @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . as _",
    "elementary operations_.    a natural setting@xcite for reconstructing an object is the @xmath4 dimensional euclidean vector space @xmath5 , whose components correspond to the values of @xmath4 pixels , in an imaging application , or in the case of crystallography , a sampling of the electron density at @xmath4 regular grid points in the unit cell .",
    "the main benefit of the euclidean space is the ability to define a distance between objects .",
    "it is convenient to consider a complex euclidean space , where unitary transformations such as the fourier transform may act .",
    "since distance is preserved by unitary transformations , distances can be measured in either the object or fourier domains .    with the ability to measure distance we can define more precisely the elementary operations for constructing objects with properties @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc.@xcite these are the  projections \" , which begin with some point @xmath6 , and find a point @xmath7 having property @xmath2 , for example , and whose distance from @xmath8 is a minimum . for most of the projections usually considered in imaging and crystallography , the point with minimum distance",
    "is essentially unique and can be computed in a time that grows no faster than @xmath9 .",
    "this is important , since we anticipate that many elementary projections will be required to arrive at the desired object having all the properties @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc .",
    "the earliest application of projections to reconstruct an image from fourier modulus and support constraints is the gerchberg - saxton@xcite map : @xmath10 .",
    "when applied to an initial randomly chosen point , the idea is that successive iterates might simultaneously get closer , both to the subspace of @xmath5 having the correct fourier modulus , as well as the subspace corresponding to the support constraint .",
    "owing to the non - convexity@xcite of the subspace of correct fourier modulus , this map has the problem that it can encounter fixed points which have the correct support but fail to have the correct modulus .",
    "the gerchberg - saxton map in this situation moves the point from one constraint subspace to the other , and then back to the original point ; a point common to both subspaces has not been identified .",
    "this phenomenon , potentially present for all projections where the corresponding subspace is non - convex , is known as  stagnation \" .",
    "to avoid stagnation , various generalizations@xcite of the gerchberg - saxton map have been proposed . in imaging ,",
    "the most successful of these have been schemes where the iterates are not confined to the constraint subspaces .",
    "in particular , objects realized as general linear combinations of other objects are generated that take advantage of the vector space nature of the search space . for these generalized maps it is usually the case that none of the iterates enroute to the solution satisfy _ any _ of the constraints .",
    "fienup@xcite has devised a family of maps motivated by ideas from control theory , of which the  hybrid input - output \" map stands out as the most successful in a wide variety of imaging applications .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the hybrid input - output map , however , is very incomplete .",
    "there is not even a compelling argument that sets the  hybrid \" version of the map apart from its less successful input - output relatives .",
    "also , whereas the hybrid input - output map was developed for imaging applications with a support constraint , one would like to be able to exploit its excellent performance characteristics in applications such as crystallography , where support constraints are usually not available .",
    "this paper describes a general map formed by taking the difference of a pair of elementary projections .",
    "the advantage of such a  difference map \" is that stagnation , in a strict sense , can be ruled out . by optimizing local convergence properties , the detailed form of the difference map",
    "is determined up to a single real parameter @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , for the special case of support constraints , the value @xmath1 reproduces an input - output type of map , and it is exactly of the hybrid variety .",
    "other values of @xmath0 , such as @xmath11 , give maps for which there are no input - output counterparts and yet whose performance in numerical experiments is also very good .",
    "perhaps most significant is the versatility of the difference map with respect to the elementary projections from which it is built . in particular , all of the examples reconstructed in numerical experiments with support projection can , when implemented by the difference map , be reconstructed using an elementary projection onto a known distribution of object values .",
    "the set of object values , or histogram , is a form of _ a priori _ constraint that can be exploited in crystallography .",
    "the difference map thus provides a link between the most successful phase retrieval method in imaging , the hybrid input - output map , and the crystallographic phase problem .",
    "a projection , of arbitrary points in the @xmath4 dimensional euclidean space of objects , to points on a subspace , representing a particular constraint , is said to be _ elementary _ if it is ( i ) distance minimizing and unique , and ( ii ) easy to compute . in imaging and crystallography ,",
    " easy to compute \" translates to the statement that the operation count scale essentially as @xmath4 .",
    "below is a collection of elementary projections that have been employed in various phase retrieval schemes :    * fourier modulus . *",
    "it is convenient to express all projections with respect to a common basis in @xmath5 , which we take to be the object domain .",
    "because the fourier modulus projection is more naturally expressed in the fourier domain , we write @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unitary transformation to the fourier domain , and @xmath14 is the projection operator which acts componentwise , that is , on each pixel of the ( discrete ) fourier transform . geometrically ,",
    "each complex component in the fourier transform is mapped by @xmath14 to the nearest point on a circle having a prescribed radius ( the fourier modulus ) .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath15 is distance minimizing and essentially unique ( the exception being the measure - zero set of complex numbers with zero modulus ) . since the computation of @xmath15 is linear in @xmath4 , and the multiplication by @xmath13 and @xmath16 requires @xmath9 operations when using the fft algorithm , fourier modulus projection is easy to compute . since circles are not convex , the subspace of objects satisfying the fourier modulus constraints , @xmath17 , is also non - convex",
    ".    * support .",
    "* there is a unique , distance minimizing map onto the subspace @xmath18 of objects having a specified support @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 is the value of pixel @xmath21 in the object domain , then support projection is the map @xmath22 since @xmath18 is a linear subspace it is convex ; projection computations require at most @xmath4 operations",
    ".    * positivity . * for real - valued objects one can impose positivity .",
    "the unique , distance minimizing map to the corresponding subspace @xmath23 , sets all negative pixels values to zero and leaves the positive pixel values unchanged .",
    "like @xmath18 , @xmath23 is convex .",
    "moreover , the projections @xmath24 and @xmath25 commute and can be combined into a single elementary projection .",
    "* histogram . *",
    "histogram projection@xcite is complementary to support projection , if we regard the object as a function from the support @xmath19 to a set of values , or  histogram \" , @xmath26 . here",
    "we define the object histogram @xmath26 to be the set of @xmath4 pixel values without regard to pixel position . for real - valued objects a distance minimizing map @xmath27 , onto the subspace of objects having histogram @xmath26 , is unique and easily computed .",
    "one begins by sorting @xmath28 and also finding an ordering of the pixels , @xmath29 , such that their values , @xmath30 are also sorted .",
    "histogram projection is then given by the map @xmath31 it is straightforward to show that @xmath27 is distance minimizing . since @xmath9 operations are required to sort @xmath4 real numbers , histogram projection is easy to compute . for complex valued objects it is probably not possible to compute the projection to a specified complex histogram in order @xmath4 operations ,",
    "although approximate distance minimizing maps can be computed with this effort@xcite .",
    "the subspace of objects having a prescribed histogram , @xmath32 , is the point set formed by applying all permutations to the point @xmath33 , and as such is non - convex .",
    "* atomicity . * the projection of greatest relevance to crystallography ( and possibly astronomy ) is the distance minimizing map to the set of objects consisting of a known number @xmath34 of non - overlapping atoms ( or stars ) .",
    "it is not necessary to make the restriction to equal atoms , although this simplifies the computation of the projection .",
    "our model of atoms will be objects of small support , usually just a @xmath35 array of pixels ( @xmath36 in three dimensions ) .",
    "the object values for each type of atom are also specified , and allowance is made for the possibility that the actual center of the atom may be located between the pixel centers ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "a unique , distance minimizing map is most easily constructed for the case of identical atoms with support on a single pixel .",
    "this situation may equivalently be characterized by its histogram : a set of @xmath34 identical positive values @xmath37 , representing the atoms , and @xmath38 zeros .",
    "atom projection , in this case , corresponds simply to histogram projection : the @xmath34 largest pixels in the object are set to @xmath37 and the remainder set to zero .",
    "the difference between histogram and atom projection emerges when the support of each atom is larger than a single pixel ; a graphical illustration is given in figure 1 .",
    "in general terms we can say that , whereas histogram projection completely neglects spatial correlations of the pixel values in the object domain , with atom projection one at least incorporates short range correlations .",
    "it is more difficult to construct atom projections for multi - pixel atoms , and consequently , to rigorously prove minimality . in practice",
    "it probably suffices to map the object reasonably near the true distance minimizing point on the subspace of atomic objects , @xmath39 .",
    "the algorithm used in the numerical experiments described in section 7 begins by sorting the pixels by value and , beginning with the largest , associates them with the specified number of atoms while observing the restriction that each new atom s support does not overlap the support of previously identified atoms .",
    "the mapping is then fine - tuned by computing the centroid of the object values within each atom s support and setting the values on the support equal to that of an atom having that particular fractional location with respect to the pixels .",
    "more details are given in the appendix .",
    "apart from the minor complication due to non - overlapping supports , the subspace @xmath39 is just the product of tori corresponding to the locations of atoms within the periodic crystal unit cell ( a non - convex set ) .",
    "this assumes that atom locations can move continuously between pixels . in practice",
    "this is only approximately true , since the support of each atom must move one pixel at a time .",
    "the discreteness of pixels also manifests itself in the relationship of @xmath39 to @xmath32 , which should be one of containment : @xmath40 . for this to be true",
    "we see that @xmath32 must contain object values for all fractional displacements of an atom relative to the pixels .",
    "clearly this is not true if we interpret @xmath32 as the point set formed by taking all permutations of a given set of @xmath4 histogram values .",
    "the true histogram should include a continuum of values , corresponding to continuous translations of the atoms .",
    "for the practical implementation of histogram projection , however , it suffices to sample just @xmath4 representative values from the continuous distribution and use these as described above .",
    "some observations of a general nature can be made if the constraint subspaces are smooth submanifolds of @xmath5 .",
    "while this is the case for the fourier modulus and support constraints , it applies approximately for atomicity since @xmath39 has a nearly smooth parametrization by continuous atomic positions on the @xmath41-dimensional torus .",
    "if one is seeking an object @xmath6 in the intersection of two smooth constraint spaces , say @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then just the dimensionalities of these spaces can provide useful information . for generic embeddings in @xmath5 , for example , one would not expect a unique solution if @xmath44 .",
    "for phase retrieval ( @xmath45 ) to be well posed , this implies @xmath46 , that is , an object support that is smaller than half of the image , if @xmath47 , or a number of atoms @xmath34 smaller than @xmath48 , if @xmath49 .",
    "the converse of this is that when a generic embedding predicts an empty intersection , the fact that a solution is _ a priori _ known to exist implies it is unique .",
    "however , as the case of phase retrieval with support constraints in one dimension@xcite shows , this form of reckoning can fail .",
    "nevertheless , experiments ( sec . 7 ) with atomicity and histogram constraints suggest that nonuniqueness in the case of overdetermined constraints is the exception rather than the rule .",
    "given two arbitrary projections @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we consider the  difference map \" @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 where @xmath0 is a nonzero real parameter and @xmath54 is the difference of the two projection operators , each composed with a map @xmath55",
    ". the detailed form of the maps @xmath56 is secondary to the global behavior of the difference map and is discussed in the next section . a fixed point of @xmath57 , @xmath58 ,",
    "is characterized by @xmath59 , or @xmath60 where @xmath61 is required to lie in the intersection of the corresponding constraint subspaces . if @xmath62 , say , and @xmath50 represents some object domain constraint , then @xmath61 is a solution of that particular instance of the phase problem .",
    "we note that in general @xmath63 . the standard approach for finding solutions is to begin with a randomly chosen point @xmath64 , iterate the map @xmath57 until a fixed point @xmath58 is found , and then use ( [ projfixedpt ] ) to find @xmath61 .",
    "even if the solution @xmath61 is unique ( up to translation and inversion ) , the set of fixed points is in general the large space given by @xmath65 one practical consequence of this is that the fixed point object @xmath58 will appear to be contaminated with noise whose origin , ultimately , is the randomness of the starting point @xmath66 .",
    "this is illustrated by the numerical experiments in section 7 .",
    "the progress of the iterates @xmath67 can be monitored by keeping a record of the norm of the differences @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the euclidean norm . the  error \"",
    "@xmath70 has the geometrical interpretation as the currently achieved distance between the two constraint subspaces , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "when this distance becomes sufficiently small , an object has been found that satisfies both sets of constraints .",
    "the behavior of @xmath70 is , in general , nonmonotonic .",
    "it is convenient to scale the constraint subspaces so that they lie on the sphere of unit norm .",
    "the magnitude of the error estimate is then related to the angular separation of the constraint subspaces by @xmath73 while small values of @xmath74 imply a solution is nearby , small values encountered during the early iterates are a cause for concern .",
    "this is because it is highly improbable that the random starting point @xmath66 is within a small angle of the solution , or more precisely , the set of fixed points ( [ fixedpts ] ) .",
    "small initial errors ( angles ) are more likely to be an indication that the object constraints are too weak for reliable phase retrieval , as for example an object support that occupies nearly half the image .",
    "the maps @xmath56 in the definition of the difference map ( [ diffmap ] ) must be chosen with care if the set of fixed points is to be attractive .",
    "for example , choosing the identity map for both @xmath75 and @xmath76 does not give attractive fixed points . in order to limit the possibilities for these maps we use a geometric approach that relies on the elementary projections @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the current iterate ( object ) . using projections",
    "we can obtain two additional points , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "pairs of points determine lines ; in particular , @xmath79 is a general point , parametrized by a real number @xmath80 , on the line defined by @xmath8 and @xmath81 . using ( [ fmap ] ) as a definition of the maps",
    "@xmath56 might be viewed as taking the first step beyond simply using identity maps for the @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , the parameter choice @xmath82 reduces exactly to this case .",
    "however , we will see that we need to exploit the freedom associated with @xmath80 to optimize the local convergence properties of the difference map .",
    "we also see that only the compositions @xmath83 with @xmath84 , for @xmath85 , make sense when considered locally .",
    "this is because locally the constraint subspace @xmath86 may be approximated as an affine linear space , where @xmath87 , and hence nothing is gained by introducing the maps @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , it is easily shown that nothing beyond the form ( [ fmap ] ) is gained by considering arbitrary points on the _ plane _ determined by all three points ( @xmath8 and its two projections , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "the optimum values for @xmath88 and @xmath89 are determined by considering one iteration of the difference map for points @xmath8 in the vicinity of a solution .",
    "putting aside the case of histogram constraints , we assume that the constraint subspaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 are smooth , or nearly so . at a solution ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 intersect and can be approximated as linear affine spaces .",
    "we will treat the case where the corresponding linear spaces @xmath90 and @xmath91 are orthogonal .",
    "although this assumption may fail for certain pairs of projections , it prevails in the probabilistic sense of randomly oriented spaces satisfying @xmath92 in the limit @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath94 is the complement in @xmath5 of the span of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then a general point can be uniquely expressed as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the constraint spaces are now explicitly approximated as @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "orthogonality of the spaces @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath94 implies the shortest element in @xmath103 is @xmath104 .",
    "thus a solution ( intersection ) corresponds to @xmath105 , while @xmath106 represents a  trap \" , that is , a source of stagnation .",
    "the latter is illustrated by the action of the gerchberg - saxton map @xmath107 .",
    "first note the formulas for projections of a general point ( these make use of the distance minimizing property of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) : @xmath108 one application of @xmath109 brings us to the fixed point @xmath110 and stagnation occurs",
    ". subsequent applications of the elementary projections simply hop between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the two points on @xmath71 and @xmath72 with minimum separation .",
    "the behavior of the difference map is quite different , as we now show .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives the result @xmath113 first consider the case @xmath114 , corresponding to a true intersection of the subspaces at the solution @xmath115 . from ( [ daction ] )",
    "we see that subsequent iterates approach the fixed point @xmath116 provided @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this excludes @xmath119 , or identity maps , for the @xmath56 .",
    "optimal convergence ( one iteration ) is achieved by the parameter values @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this choice also makes @xmath57 maximally contractive ; the rank of the jacobian is then @xmath122 . as explained in the previous section , a fixed point of @xmath57",
    "guarantees a true solution and it is given by @xmath123 .",
    "next we examine the situation for @xmath106 , when the two constraint subspaces locally form a trap . with the parameters @xmath80 set to their optimal values , subsequent iterates have the form @xmath124 rather than hopping between the two constraint subspaces we see that the iterates move away uniformly along the nearest separation axis , @xmath125 , with a rate determined by @xmath0 . in a sense",
    ", the map has recognized that there is no solution at hand locally and seeks one elsewhere .",
    "the local geometry of solutions and traps is rendered schematically in figure 2 .",
    "it should be understood that this view , and the analysis in this section , is valid only when there exists a minimum local separation of the two constraint subspaces , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 is small on the scale where these subspaces deviate from linearity . we summarize the results of the last two sections with the final form of the difference map : @xmath128 - \\pi_2\\left [ ( 1 - \\beta^{-1})\\pi_1(\\rho ) + \\beta^{-1 } \\rho\\right ] \\right ) \\quad.\\ ] ] we note that all nonzero values of @xmath0 offer interesting choices , and that reversing the sign of @xmath0 has the effect of interchanging the two projections .",
    "from ( [ diffmap2 ] ) we see that four elementary projections are computed for every iteration of the difference map .",
    "this number is reduced to two when @xmath129 . in the case of support constraints ,",
    "that is , @xmath130 and @xmath62 , and the choice @xmath1 , one obtains the simple result : @xmath131 this is fienup s hybrid input - output map@xcite for an object with support @xmath19 and fienup s parameter @xmath132 . in his discussion of input - output maps , fienup also considered the maps @xmath133 @xmath134 only the hybrid map ( [ hybrid ] ) can be obtained as a special case of the difference map .",
    "it is interesting that of the three input - output maps tested numerically by fienup , the hybrid map outperformed the others and the optimum performance occurred for the parameter value @xmath135 . in these studies@xcite a fixed number of iterations of an input - output map",
    "was followed by several iterations of the gerchberg - saxton map in order to arrive at the solution . in view of the discussion in section 3 , concerning the distinction between the solution and the fixed point of the map",

    "the choice @xmath138 in the difference map with support constraint is also relatively simple , but does not appear to have been studied previously .",
    "this has the effect of interchanging the roles of support and fourier modulus projection . to express the resulting map most compactly",

    "phase retrieval in crystallography has traditionally been performed purely in the fourier domain , whereas the _ a priori _ constraint of greatest relevance , atomicity , is most directly expressed in the object domain .",
    "a key development in the history of crystallographic phase retrieval was sayre s equation@xcite , which permitted a simple translation from the object to the fourier domain for the case of identical , non - overlapping atoms . in the object domain sayre s equation",

    "strange attractors can be tolerated when their number is small : one need only restart the iterations , hopefully within the basin of attraction of a simple fixed point .",

    "one such fabrication , for example , is to form two different objects having the same histogram and attempt phase retrieval using their averaged fourier moduli .",
    "it is highly unlikely that phases exist which can be combined with this fabricated modulus data and yield an object having the required histogram . on the other hand , because the statistical properties of the fabricated data is very similar to that of either of the two genuine objects , the qualitative behavior of the difference map should be unchanged .",
    "the only real difference between the genuine and fabricated data is that the difference map iterates for the former will eventually find a fixed point , while for the latter the iterates will continue exploring indefinitely a space that we expect to share all the essential characteristics of the space being explored in the case of the genuine objects .",

    "whose second pair of phase angles were both close to zero , the first pair of angles were plotted as a point in the plane",

    "the collapse of the search space with decreasing @xmath0 is consistent with a corresponding improvement in phase retrieval performance ( for non - fabricated data ) .",
    "the absence of inversion symmetry in the image for @xmath228 indicates that the threshold to the regime of multiple attractors has been crossed",

    "a meaningful measure of the size of the search space , for example , might be given in terms of the dimensionality of the associated attractor .",
    "it would be interesting to study not just the evolution of complexity ( e.g. attractor dimensionality ) with parameters defining the iterative map ( @xmath0 ) , but also with respect to quantifiable attributes of the object ( clustering ) .",
    "the application of phase retrieval which currently poses the greatest challenge is macromolecular crystallography .",
    "recently the shake and bake ( snb ) method@xcite has succeeded in retrieving phases for small proteins without the benefit of the additional mir or mad data normally required for protein structure determination .",
    "snb@xcite is iterative and uses object domain atomicity projection and objective function minimization as its two elementary operations .",
    "on general grounds , however , one can argue that the snb method may not have realized its full potential .",
