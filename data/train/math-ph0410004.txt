    "<S> maxwell s multipoles are a natural geometric characterisation of real functions on the sphere ( with fixed @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between multipoles for gaussian random functions are calculated , by mapping the spherical functions to random polynomials . in the limit of high @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the 2-point function tends to a form previously derived by hannay in the analogous problem for the majorana sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the application to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature of randomness is the emergence of structure arising from independent processes . </S>",
    "<S> here , i describe a simple , universal correlation structure associated with statistically isotropic random functions on the sphere : the correlations between maxwell s multipoles . in the multipole representation , any real spherical function @xmath2 with fixed @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> may be represented by @xmath0 unit vectors @xmath3 @xmath4 for @xmath5 ( ensuring reality of @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 restricted to the sphere and @xmath8 a numerical constant . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 vectors @xmath9 are called maxwell s multipoles @xcite , and are determined uniquely ( up to sign ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the maxwell representation is that the multipoles rotate directly with the function , and are defined without reference to an external reference frame ( unlike spherical harmonics ) . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary spherical function with fixed @xmath1 with its corresponding multipole directions , is shown in figure [ fig : polesex ] .     </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath10 the radius of the plot is determined by @xmath11 plus a constant , and shaded according to the value of @xmath12 the maxwell multipole directions for the function are also represented.,width=226 ]    the quantity discussed in this note is the correlation of the maxwell multipole directions for completely random functions of the form ( [ eq : spherrep ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> complete randomness means that the probability density function of @xmath6 depends only on the sum @xmath13 the statistical distribution of the multipoles ( which is automatically rotationally symmetric ) is determined absolutely by this restriction . here a gaussian distribution of the sum is chosen for calculations , which implies that the @xmath14 coefficients can be taken as independent ( for @xmath15 ) , identically distributed gaussians ( by analogy with the derivation of the maxwell distribution in kinetic theory ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical morphology of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation is still little understood , and it has been suggested that correlations between maxwell multipoles might reveal hidden structure in the data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , i will derive the universal correlation function of maxwell multipoles for a statistically isotropic spherical function , using independent gaussian random @xmath16 coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the present analytic approach contrasts with the numerical monte carlo computations for the same isotropic gaussian distribution studied in the papers referred to above .    </S>",
    "<S> the main tool used in the calculation is the majorana representation of spherical functions ( also called the ` stellar representation ' ) @xcite . in this representation , </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath11 with the form ( [ eq : spherrep ] ) is represented as a polynomial in the complex variable @xmath17 @xmath18 the relationship with the sphere is realised by taking @xmath19 as a stereographic coordinate in the complex plane . since each @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> the roots of the polynomial @xmath21 occur in antipodal pairs @xmath22 these are the stereographic projections of the maxwell multipole vectors ( whose sign is undefined ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for complex functions on the sphere ( with independent @xmath14 ) , spinor - like majorana directions arise from the roots of ( [ eq : majorana ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the language of group theory , basis functions of the unitary ( rotation ) group su(2 ) are mapped to those of the linear group sl(2,@xmath23 ) in this representation . )    </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the spherical function ( [ eq : spherrep ] ) , with gaussian random coefficients , with the polynomial ( [ eq : majorana ] ) , reduces the problem to a calculation of the statistics of roots of random polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> the roots of spin - like random polynomials ( su(2 ) polynomials ) have been studied , particularly in connection with quantum chaotic systems @xcite , with the distribution ( [ eq : majorana ] ) , but different restrictions on the identically distributed gaussian coefficients @xmath24    the present calculation is similar to that of hannay @xcite , who derived the @xmath25-point correlation function @xmath26 between the majorana spinor directions for complex functions analogous to @xmath6 in equation ( [ eq : spherrep ] ) , that is , with no additional requirements on the coefficients @xmath24 the 2-point function @xmath27 in the large @xmath0 limit , was found to have a simple universal form . following the same method , </S>",
    "<S> maxwell s multipoles are found here to limit to the same function . </S>",
    "<S> readers not interested in the details of the calculation may skip to equation ( [ eq : rho21 ] ) and the following discussion .    as stated above , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 in equation ( [ eq : spherrep ] ) is assumed to have coefficients @xmath14 independent and identically gaussian distributed ( which implies , but is not implied by , isotropy ) : @xmath28 all statistical information about the multipoles is in the zeros of the majorana polynomial ( [ eq : majorana ] ) , which are accessed by averaging @xmath29 at the point @xmath30 and its derivative @xmath31 the joint probability density function @xmath32 for @xmath25 points @xmath33 is given by the gaussian distribution @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the @xmath37 hermitian correlation matrix @xmath38 following @xcite , submatrices ( of dimension @xmath39 ) of @xmath36 will be identified : @xmath40    nonvanishing terms ( and their conjugates ) appearing in @xmath36 are @xcite @xmath41 following from averaging the complex polynomials ( [ eq : majorana ] ) using ( [ eq : iid ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25-point function @xmath42 is found using standard methods for finding the correlations of zeros of gaussian random functions ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the submatrix of @xmath46 in the position of @xmath47 in @xmath48 by jacobi s determinant theorem @xcite , @xmath49 and @xmath50    the final part of the calculation is a gaussian integration by parts ( i.e. the finite dimensional analogue of wick s theorem ) , and the final result is @xmath51 times a combinatorial term . </S>",
    "<S> this term is the sum over products of elements of @xmath52 one for each pairing of the @xmath39 terms @xmath53 the elements of @xmath54 in the product are those which correspond to the appropriate components of @xmath55 in the quadratic form .    the simplest nontrivial case is the 2-point function @xmath27 which is @xmath56 it should be noted that , since the @xmath57 are correlated with each other ( rather than simply with their conjugates ) , this combinatorial term is rather more complicated than the simple permanent found in @xcite ; furthermore , the choice of some elements of @xmath54 is not unique ( for example , in the third summand in the numerator in ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) , @xmath58 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the 1-point function @xmath59 is simply the density of roots in the complex plane ( counting each multipole direction , undetermined in sign , twice ) . on the sphere , this is uniform with value @xmath60 the 2-point function @xmath61 can be simplified by taking the two points to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 for points with angular separation @xmath65 ) ; no generality is lost since the distribution is rotationally symmetric on the sphere . from ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) , this is @xmath66   \\nonumber \\\\     \\times [ d d - 2 c u v ( a + 1 - u^2 ) - ( c^2 + a v^2)(a - 1 - u^2 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\     + [ 2\\ell d - 2 c u v - b u v ( a + 1 -u^2 ) - v^2 ( a - 1 + u^2 ) - b c ( a - 1 - u^2)]^2    \\nonumber \\\\      + [ w d - 2 b c u - u v^2 ( a + 1 - u^2 ) - b v ( a - 1 + u^2 ) - c v ( a - 1 - u^2)]^2 \\ } \\label{eq : rho21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 and , extending the notation of @xcite , @xmath68 to find the 2-point multipole correlation function function on the sphere @xmath69 for points with angular separation @xmath70 this must be multiplied by the stereographic jacobian @xmath71 and substituting @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 is symmetric about @xmath73 by antipodality of the multipole directions </S>",
    "<S> . the function may be normalised ( i.e. is unity when points are uncorrelated ) by dividing by the square of the density @xmath60 when @xmath74 @xmath75 can be found from equation ( [ eq : rho21 ] ) , @xmath76 agreeing up to a numerical constant with that found by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 is plotted against @xmath65 in figure [ fig : rho2 ] for some choices of @xmath78 there is good agreement with the corresponding numerical results of @xcite ( who plot against @xmath79 ) </S>",
    "<S> .     plotted against @xmath65 ( in degrees ) for multipoles with separation @xmath65 for ( a ) @xmath80 ( b ) @xmath81 ( c ) @xmath82 ( d ) @xmath83 the function has been divided by the square of multipole density @xmath84 ( so approaches 1 for large @xmath0 ) , and the behaviour for small @xmath65 is quadratic.,width=377 ]    in @xcite , it was found , for a general complex isotropic majorana polynomial , in the limit of large @xmath1 that @xmath85 tends to @xmath86 where @xmath87 in equation ( [ eq : rho21 ] ) , on writing @xmath88 and taking the large @xmath0 limit ( in which @xmath89 and @xmath90 approach @xmath62 ) , equation ( [ eq : rho21 ] ) factorizes to give the 2-point function of this general complex case ( equation ( 11 ) in @xcite ) . in the complex plane , this large @xmath0 limit of the general random majorana polynomials is the universal ` chaotic analytic function ' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> different symmetries for the random polynomial coefficients have been investigated , such as for @xmath14 real @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the distribution of roots in the complex plane behaves singularly on the real axis ( where roots appear in complex conjugate pairs ) , and approaches the chaotic analytic function behaviour far from these lines ( where there is little influence from the conjugate , paired zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( the generalization of random polynomials with coefficients of fixed argument @xcite have similar behaviour . ) </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of roots of the maxwell multipole polynomials is uniform on the ( stereographic ) sphere , and the difference with the chaotic analytic function polynomials is the presence of the antipodal root , whose influence diminishes as @xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for high @xmath1 the correlations between maxwell multipoles also limit to the form ( [ eq : hannayg ] ) , apparently by a power law .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath91 exhibits quadratic repulsion at the origin with a small maximum of @xmath92 at @xmath93 , and thereafter approaches 1 exponentially . for high @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath61 ( visible in figure [ fig : rho2 ] ) is approximately at @xmath94 in this limit , the 2-point function of maxwell multipoles is therefore constant ( there is no correlation ) apart from a tiny repulsion region near each multipole . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to the closely related system of a one - component plasma on the sphere @xcite , whose 2-point correlation function , in the thermodynamic limit , approaches a constant apart from repulsion very near the origin .    </S>",
    "<S> higher correlation functions between more maxwell multipole directions , which are universal for completely random spherical functions , can also be calculated using the methods described here . for large @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> these will tend to the same behaviour as high @xmath0 random majorana polynomials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is possible that lower @xmath0 correlations might reveal more subtle structure , which may be compared with cmb data .    </S>",
    "<S> i am grateful to mark birkinshaw and john hannay for discussions , and to jeff weeks who pointed out to me the relevance of maxwell s multipoles to cmb . </S>",
