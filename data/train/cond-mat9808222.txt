    "<S> we consider two partially frustrated s = @xmath0 antiferromagnetic spin systems on the triangular and pentagonal lattices . in an elementary plaquette of the two lattices , </S>",
    "<S> one bond has exchange interaction strength @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) whereas all other bonds have exchange interaction strength unity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for @xmath1 less than a critical value @xmath3 , collinear nel - type ordering is possible in the ground state . the ground state energy and the excitation spectrum have been determined using linear spin wave theory based on the holstein - primakoff transformation .    </S>",

    "<S> p.a.c.s . </S>",
    "<S> numbers : 75.10.jm , 75.30.ds    frustrated spin sytems show a tendency to be magnetically disordered . </S>",
    "<S> frustration may occur due to the presence of further neighbour interactions , besides the nearest - neighbour(nn ) ones , as well as due to the topology of the underlying lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a well - known example of the latter is the triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the ising antiferromagnet(afm ) , defined on the triangular lattice , is highly degenerate with the entropy per site being a finite quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the ising afm thus does not order at any temperature . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the question of interest is whether for a quantum spin hamiltonian long range magnetic order can exist in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum heisenberg afm has been widely studied on the triangular lattice @xcite and there is now more or less a cosensus that afm long range order(lro ) exists in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the classical spin systems exhibits non - collinear @xmath4 ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering is partially destroyed but still exists once the quantum nature of the spins is taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> frustrated lattices , in general , exhibit non - collinear nel - type magnetic order whereas non - frustrated lattices like the square lattice exhibit collinear nel - type order in the classical ground state . a partially frustrated lattice is obtained when not all the exchange interaction strengths along nn bonds have equal values . in this case , the classical ground state , in a particular parameter regime , exhibits collinear nel - type ordering similar to that in the case of a non - frustrated lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering is not destroyed when quantum fluctuations are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> two examples of this will be given in this brief report , namely , those of the triangular and the pentagonal lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the classical ground state of the triangular lattice is already known @xcite . in the so called row model , the strength of the unequel exchange interaction is @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) whereas all other exchange interaction strengths have value unity ( fig.1 ) . for @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state has collinear order whereas for @xmath7 , non - collinear spiral ordering occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this ordering becomes the @xmath8 ordering when @xmath9 . for @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the excitation spectrum as well as the quantal correction to the ground state energy using linear spin wave ( lsw ) theory based on the holstein - primakoff(hp ) transformation . </S>",
    "<S> we next consider the case of the partially frustrated pentagonal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the ising afm has been previously studied on the pentagonal lattice @xcite and the ground state has been found to be disordered . in this brief report , we study the spin @xmath11 hafm on the pentagonal lattice for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary plaquette of a pentagonal lattice is a pentagon and hence the lattice is topologically frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> we study the model in a limited parameter regime , namely , the one in which collinear nel - type order exists in the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a single triangular plaquette with three nn bonds . </S>",
    "<S> one of the bonds has exchange interaction strength @xmath1 , the other two have exchange interaction strengths unity . </S>",
    "<S> the three spins sit at the three vertices and interact through nn interaction . if the spins are treated as classical vectors , it is easy to show that for @xmath12 , collinear nel - type ordering is obtained in the ground state . let 0 , q , @xmath13 be the respective orientations of the spins with respect to the z - axis . </S>",
    "<S> the first and third spins interact through exchange interaction of strength @xmath1 . in the collinear state , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for @xmath16 , @xmath17 in the ground state with @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , a spiral ordering is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the row model ( fig.1 ) with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the sites belonging to alternate rows ( shown by dashed lines ) belong to one of the sublattices a or b. the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the nn vectors in the horizontal and oblique directions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spins on the a(b ) sublattice are pointing up(down ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the classical ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the foundation of spin wave theory is the assumption that afm lro exists in the ground state and the amplitude of zero - point motion produced by quantum fluctuation about the classical ordered state is small . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption fails if quantal corrections diverge . </S>",
    "<S> the first step in the lsw theory is to transform the operators to the bosonic operators . </S>",
    "<S> the hp transformations connecting the spin operators to the bosonic operators @xmath23,@xmath24 s are given in the lowest order by @xmath25 where j denotes the lattice site and s is the magnitude of the spins . </S>",
    "<S> we will ultimately consider the case of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the spin raising operator and z component of the spin respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one can similarly define the spin lowering operator @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we will not exhibit the different steps of lsw theory as these are standard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian(1 ) is expressed in terms of bosonic operators and then fourier transformed . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian contains only quadratic operators and so can be diagonalized by the well - known bogolyubov transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalized hamiltonian is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30,@xmath31 are the new transformed operators and n is the total number of sites . the excitation spectrum @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and z , the number of nns along the oblique directions , is 4 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the excitation spectrum for @xmath35 and s = @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy @xmath36 ( the sum of the first two terms in ( 3 ) ) is given by @xmath36 = -0.6025 . </S>",
    "<S> one can verify that for @xmath37 , the excitation spectrum for the square lattice is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath38 , @xmath32 is positive for all momentum wave vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the choice of the starting ground state is correct .    </S>",
    "<S> we next turn to the case of the pentagonal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a cross - section of the lattice is shown in fig 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice is a non - bravais lattice and has two types of sites with coordination numbers 3 and 4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the nn exchange interaction strengths along the solid lines are given by @xmath1 ( @xmath39 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider a single pentagonal plaquette . </S>",
    "<S> the classical ground state for different values of @xmath1 can be determined by minimizing the exchange interaction energy with respect to the spin orientation angles . for @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the collinear nel state is the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the question is whether this order survives once the quantal fluctuations are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> again , we perform lsw theory to get an answer . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows the six sublattices @xmath41 corresponding to the six inequivalent sites . </S>",
    "<S> the a(b ) sublattices contain up(down ) spins . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath42 where < i j > denotes nns and @xmath43=1 for nns shown by solid lines in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the nn vectors @xmath44 s are given by @xmath45 and similarly for the vectors in the reverse directions . </S>",
    "<S> the hp transformations connecting the spin operators to bosonic operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> each of the six kinds of hp bosons forms a rectangular sublattice with dimension @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> after fourier transformation , the hamiltonian(6 ) becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51\\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\ \\vspace{1 cm } z_{1k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc }       2 - 4\\alpha\\,\\sin^2\\frac{k\\cdot \\delta_1}{2 } & \\quad 0&\\quad 0\\\\       0&\\quad 3 & \\quad 0\\\\       0&\\quad   0 & \\quad 3\\end{array}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\ </S>",

    "<S> the eigenvalues of @xmath64 occur in pairs with @xmath66>0 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath64 can be diagonalized numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain three excitation spectra each of which is doubly degenerate corresponding to the two sublattices @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalized hamiltonian has the form @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 fig.4 shows the three excitation spectra for @xmath700.27 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the positivity of the spectra shows that the collinear nel state with quantum corrections is still the ground state . for @xmath1 beyond the critical value @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath710.32 this is no longer so . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy @xmath36 is given by eq.(18 ) and has the value @xmath36 = -0.4835 for @xmath1=0.27 .    </S>",
    "<S> for both the triangular and pentagonal lattices , there is a critical value @xmath3 of @xmath1 below which the classical ground state has collinear nel - type order . as shown by lsw theory </S>",
    "<S> , the order is maintained , albeit with quantum corrections , when the quantum nature of the spins is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the case @xmath72 . for the triangular lattice , </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned before , the ground state shows spiral ordering . for the pentagonal lattice , however , the problem is more difficult . consider the case @xmath1=1 . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for an elementary plaquette show that in the classical ground state the difference in the successive spin orientation angles is @xmath73 . unlike the case of the triangular lattice </S>",
    "<S> , the spin arrangement of a single pentagon can not be repeated for the whole lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the classical ground state structure thus becomes computationally more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter region @xmath72 for the pentagonal lattice has not been studied as yet . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 can be taken as a measure of frustration in a spin system . </S>",
    "<S> the values for the square , triangular and pentagonal lattices are @xmath3 = 1 , 0.5 and @xmath740.32 respectively . thus the pentagonal lattice appears to be more frustrated than the triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> several studies have been undertaken in the recent past to understand the effect of topological frustration on ground state properties . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the most studied cases are those of the triangular and kagom lattices . </S>",
    "<S> frustration , in general , leads to more disorder in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in spin - disordered states has arisen in connection with high temperature superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the pentagonal lattice is another topologically frustrated lattice which has not been studied so far in the context of quantum spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> the present study constitutes a small begining which will hopefully lead to more exhaustive studies in future . </S>"
