    "complex clinical trials always involve multiple research objectives that are related in a hierarchically logical fashion based on importance , clinical relevance , and so on .",
    "consequently , the statistical hypotheses formulated to address such objectives are grouped into hierarchically ordered families of hypotheses requiring them to be tested in a predefined sequence . testing multiple families of hypotheses has received much attention in the last decade , and several methods have been introduced in the literature , including gatekeeping strategy ( westfall and krishen , 2001 ; dmitrienko , offen and westfall , 2003 ; dmitrienko , wiens and tamhane , 2007 ) , union closure procedures ( kim , entsuah and shults , 2011 ) and superchain procedures ( kordzakhia and dmitrienko , 2013 ) .",
    "the gatekeeping strategy is a general approach developed specifically to test pre - ordered families of hypotheses in a sequential manner with each family working as a gatekeeper for the ones following it .",
    "there are several types of gatekeeping strategies available in the literature , such as serial gatekeeping strategy ( maurer , hothorn and lehmacher , 1995 ; bauer et al .",
    "1998 ; westfall and krishen , 2001 ) , parallel gatekeeping strategy ( dmitrienko , offen and westfall , 2003 ) , and tree gatekeeping strategy ( dmitrienko , wiens and tamhane , 2007 ; dmitrienko et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "based on these gatekeeping strategies , some other more powerful and flexible multiple testing methods have been developed ( chen , luo and capizzi , 2005 ; liu and hsu , 2009 ; dmitrienko et al . , 2006 ; dmitrienko , tamhane and wiens , 2008 ; dmitrienko and tamhane , 2011 ; guibaud , 2007 ; bretz et al . , 2009 ; and burman , sonesson and guilbaud , 2009 ) .",
    "for reviews on recent developments , see dmitrienko , tamhane and bretz ( 2009 ) , dmitrienko , dagostino and huque ( 2013 ) , and alosh , bretz and huque ( 2014 ) .",
    "the aforementioned gatekeeping procedures allow each family to be tested only once , which some researchers have attempted to improve .",
    "more specifically , they have added retesting options to enhance their testing powers ( guibaud , 2007 ; dmitrienko , kordzakhia and tamhane , 2011 ; dmitrienko et al . , 2011 ; and kordzakhia and dmitrienko , 2013 ) .",
    "guilbaud ( 2007 ) incorporated the retesting option into bonferroni based gatekeeping procedures by allowing the families to be retested in a reverse order by using procedures more powerful than the original bonferroni procedures when all hypotheses in the last family are rejected .",
    "dmitrienko , kordzakhia and tamhane ( 2011 ) improved guilbaud s procedure by applying some mixture procedure to each family instead of the bonferroni procedure . in the case of testing two families , dmitrienko et al .",
    "( 2011 ) further improved the aforementioned procedures with retesting option by using the second family as a parallel gatekeeper instead of a serial gatekeeper for the first family ; that is , as long as one hypothesis is rejected in the second family , the first family can be retested by using a more powerful procedure than the one used in the previous step . however",
    ", this procedure not only restricts to two - family case , it also requires to specify the logical relationship between each specific hypothesis in first family with each specific hypothesis in second family .",
    "in contrast with the aforementioned sequential retesting procedures , kordzakhia and dmitrienko ( 2013 ) introduced a class of multiple testing procedures with retesting option on the basis of the simultaneous testing strategy , termed as superchain procedures . unlike those sequential retesting procedures , superchain procedures test all families simultaneously at each step .",
    "each family serves as a parallel gatekeeper for the other families . if at least one new rejection occurs in either family , the rest of the families",
    "are retested using procedures with updated critical values at the next step .",
    "compared to the superchain procedures , the sequential retesting procedures are , however , simpler , easier to implement , and more intuitive in a clinical sense , although they have certain limitations and are restricted to some specific scenarios . in this paper , we consider overcoming such limitations and restrictions by developing newer sequential retesting procedures .",
    "our procedure proposed in this paper is bonferroni based gatekeeping procedure with retesting option .",
    "however , the families are now being allowed to be retested repeatedly using bonferroni procedures in a sequential manner with different critical value at each repetition for a family . to begin with ,",
    "each family is assigned a pre - determined fraction of the overall level @xmath0 for its initial critical value .",
    "the critical value used to test one particular family is defined as its local critical value .",
    "the level for the local critical value ( referred to as local level ) for a family at each test depends on certain amount of the levels associated with the local critical values passed down from higher ranked families and the initial levels assigned to lower ranked families .",
    "each family is iteratively retested with increasingly updated local critical values .",
    "the proposed procedure exhibits several desirable features .",
    "first , as we prove , it strongly controls the global familywise error rate ( fwer ) , i.e. , the probability of falsely rejecting at least one true null hypothesis across all families of hypotheses at a pre - specified level @xmath0 under arbitrary dependence .",
    "second , it is more general than the existing sequential retesting procedures since it can be constructed under almost any scenarios . and",
    "it strictly follows the hierarchical sequential scheme in the sense that higher rank families have more chances to be retested than lower rank families .",
    "third , it is easier to implement than superchain procedure since it sticks to the simple bonferroni method for testing each family throughout the whole procedure and proceeds in a sequential manner .",
    "finally and interestingly , it can be described via a directed graph similar to the graphical approach ( see bretz et al . , 2009 ) , except that the nodes of the graph here represent families instead of hypotheses , and it is easy to explain the underlying testing strategy to non - statisticians .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present some notations and definitions which are used throughout the whole paper .",
    "the main theoretical results are introduced in section 3 including the algorithms of the proposed procedures and discussions of their global fwer control .",
    "several special cases are discussed in section 4 to demonstrate the relationships among the proposed procedures and some existing ones .",
    "section 5 includes two clinical trial examples to illustrate the implementation of the proposed procedures .",
    "section 6 extends the proposed procedures to a two - layer structure with multiple families within each layer while maintaining the control of the global fwer .",
    "some concluding remarks are discussed in section 7 and the appendix gives proofs of the theoretical results .",
    "in this section , we present some basic notations and definitions .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath1 hypotheses grouped into @xmath2 ordered families , with @xmath3 being the @xmath4 ordered family consisting of @xmath5 hypotheses , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "these hypotheses are to be tested based on their respective @xmath8-values @xmath9 subject to controlling an overall measure of type i error at a pre - specified level @xmath0 .",
    "each of the true null @xmath8-values is assumed to be stochastically greater than or equal to the uniform distribution on @xmath10 $ ] ; that is , if @xmath11 is the set of true null hypotheses in @xmath12 , then @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the familywise error rate ( fwer ) , which is the probability of incorrectly rejecting at least one true null hypothesis , is a commonly used notion of an overall measure of type i error when testing a single family of hypotheses .",
    "since we have multiple families , we consider this measure not locally for each family but globally . in other words , we define the global fwer as the probability of incorrectly rejecting at least one true null hypothesis across all families of hypotheses .",
    "if it is bounded above by @xmath0 regardless of which and how many null hypotheses within each family are true , then this global fwer is said to be strongly controlled at @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a procedure , called bonferroni based gatekeeping procedure with retesting option , strongly controlling the global fwer at @xmath0 . with an initial assignment of a pre - specified portion of @xmath0 ,",
    "say @xmath14 , to @xmath12 , where @xmath15 , the procedure starts with testing @xmath16 to @xmath17 sequentially using the bonferroni procedure based on their own ( local ) critical values .",
    "the level used to locally test each family is updated from its initially assigned value to one which incorporates certain portions of the levels used in testing the previous families . after finishing a round of tests of all @xmath18 families ,",
    "the procedure starts over for another round of tests from @xmath16 to @xmath17 again using the bonferroni procedure based on their updated local critical values .",
    "the whole procedure stops only if there is no new rejection occurs in all @xmath18 families . the specific updating rule for local critical values",
    "is described in section 3 .",
    "the distribution of the amount of critical value transfered among families can be pre - fixed by an @xmath19 _ transition matrix _ which is defined as follows .    denote @xmath20 = \\{@xmath21 } , @xmath22 as a transition matrix which satisfies the following conditions : @xmath23 note that @xmath21 is defined as the proportion of the critical value that can be transferred from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",

    "+        dmitrienko , tamhane and wiens ( 2008 ) quantified the amount of significance level of a tested family that can be transferred to test subsequent families of hypotheses .",
    "for instance , consider testing a single family of hypotheses @xmath3 .",
    "suppose it is tested using the bonferroni procedure at level @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the set of acceptances and rejections , respectively , with the corresponding cardinalities @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "then , @xmath31 can be considered as a conservative estimate of the fwer of the bonferroni procedure .",
    "thus , the used and unused parts of level @xmath0 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the unused part , @xmath32 , can be recycled to test the subsequent families of hypotheses .",
    "this section presents our proposed bonferroni - based gatekeeping procedure with retesting option .",
    "we will begin with a simple case of two families of null hypotheses in section [ tcase ] .",
    "the general case of an arbitrary number of families will be introduced in section [ generalcase ] .",

    "the transition matrix is given by @xmath43 i.e. , @xmath44 , which implies the whole amount of local critical value of one family that can be recycled is transferred to test the other family .",

    "the initial level for each family is updated by adding to it a weighted sum of the levels used for testing or retesting the higher - ranked families at the same stage and a weighed sum of the initially assigned levels for the lower - ranked families .",

    "suppose @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "then , each layer only has one family of hypotheses .",
    "thus , algorithm [ retest ] reduces to algorithm [ twof ] introduced in section 3.1 .",
    "suppose @xmath131 .",
    "then , each family of the first layer is only related to one specific family of the second layer , that is , the hierarchical logical relationships among families are given in advance . in this case , the proposed algorithm [ retest ] takes into account such hierarchical logical relationships .",
    "suppose @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "then , both families of the second layer only rely on the testing results of one particular family of the first layer .",
    "thus , we can regard it as the case that both  child \" families share one  parent \" family , which is similar to a tree structure with retesting option . moreover , suppose @xmath134 but @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "then , @xmath137 still has a chance to be tested at the retesting stages due to the portions of levels transferred from the  child \" families of the second layer .",
    "4 .   suppose @xmath138 , then the testing results of two families of the first layer can both contribute to the local critical value of the first family of the second layer .",
    "thus , we can regard it as the case that one  child \" family has two  parent \" families .    for algorithm",
    "[ retest ] , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ thm_gen_retest_fwer ] the two - layer bonferroni - based gatekeeping procedure with retesting option described in algorithm [ retest ] strongly controls the global fwer at level @xmath0 under arbitrary dependence .    for a proof of theorem [ thm_gen_retest_fwer ] , see appendix .",
    "the main focus of this paper has been to develop simple and powerful procedures for testing ordered families of hypotheses .",
    "we have introduced a new multiple testing procedure , termed as bonferroni - based gatekeeping procedure with retesting option , in which the families of hypotheses are repeatedly tested by the bonferroni procedure at updated local critical values in a sequential manner .",
    "we have shown that the proposed procedure strongly controls the global fwer at level @xmath0 under arbitrary dependence .",
    "through two clinical trial examples , we have illustrated the straightforward testing algorithm of our proposed procedure .    both guibaud s generalized bonferroni parallel gatekeeping procedure and our proposed procedure",
    "are based on simple bonferroni method .",
    "but guibaud s procedure requires rejecting all hypotheses in the last family to start retesting .",
    "although dmiritneko et al.s @xmath0-exhaustive multistage gatekeeping procedure improves guibaud s procedure by using more powerful method than bonferroni method to test each family , the common counterintuitive problem with guibaud s method that lower rank families having more chances to be retested than higher rank families still exists .    both the superchain procedure and our proposed procedure allow iteratively retesting families of hypotheses and both of them have power improvement compared with the procedure without retesting option . although by choosing the optimized initial parameters and initial multiple testing procedure for each family , the superchain procedure might has its advantage over our procedure with respect to power , however , the proposed procedure has some better , desirable features .    while trying to solve problems associated with testing multiple ordered families of hypotheses in real life applications , it is desirable to have simplicity in the testing procedures .",
    "our proposed procedure enjoys that simplicity when compared with the superchain procedure .",
    "the sequential testing strategy in our proposed procedure seems more natural than the superchain procedure which tests all families simultaneously .",
    "given the families to be tested , the transition matrix , and the initial critical values , our procedure can be easily implemented as a graphical form based on the simple bonferroni procedure .",
    "no matter how many iterations each family has been through , the testing procedure used at each stage for each family never changes . on the contrary , for the superchain procedure ,",
    "even the graph of families is given , the specific algorithm can not be defined .",
    "one graph may have different superchain algorithms which leads to completely different testing results .",
    "it has been mentioned by kordzakhia and dmitrienko ( 2013 ) that the performance of the superchain procedure heavily depends on the choices of initial parameters , i.e. , the initial truncation parameters , and the initial local method .",
    "they have shown that the power of the superchain procedures can dramatically differ with changing initial values of the truncated parameters .",
    "thus , before starting to implement the superchain procedure , we first need to make some efforts to decide the optimal values of initial procedure parameters which add more complexities into the implementation .    from the computational point of view ,",
    "our procedure is simple and easy to implement .",
    "the implementation of the superchain procedure is complicated due to the updating rules of the local critical values and the truncation parameters of the testing procedure for each family at each stage .",
    "the computational complexity is even more severe when the number of families is large .",
    "because of these , it is difficult to communicate with non - statisticians about the algorithm of the superchain procedure .",
    "the use of the bonferroni procedure as the basic procedure for testing each family makes our proposed procedure slightly conservative compared to the dimitrienko et al.s @xmath0-exhaustive multistage gatekeeping procedure and superchain procedure in some cases .",
    "therefore , a natural extension of our present work would be to use more powerful multiple testing procedures as the basic procedures toward developing a more powerful global fwer controlling sequential procedures with retesting option .",
    "in addition , the proposed procedure controls the global fwer without any assumption of dependence structure among the underlying test statistics .",
    "given some distributional information about the test statistics , it is possible to further improve the proposed procedure .",
