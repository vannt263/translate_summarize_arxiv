    "computer - generated holograms ( cghs ) @xcite are important in optics and are used for three - dimensional television , diffractive optical elements , projection and encryption .",
    "cghs are mainly categorized into three types : complex amplitude cgh , amplitude cgh and kinoform @xcite , which is also known as phase - only cgh .",
    "complex amplitude cgh is capable of reconstructing a perfect image ; however , complex amplitude cgh requires a special device that displays the real and imaginary parts ( otherwise , amplitude and argument parts ) of the complex amplitude .",
    "whereas , amplitude cgh and kinoform do not need such a special device . amplitude cgh or kinoform",
    "is calculated by taking only the real part or the argument part of object light .",
    "the reconstructed image quality is degraded , compared to complex amplitude cgh .",
    "this paper focuses on kinoform .",
    "kinoform can reconstruct bright images , compared to amplitude cghs , because the kinoform has theoretically 100 % light efficiency .",
    "in addition , reconstructed images from kinoforms do not include conjugate light , unlike amplitude cghs . in kinoform calculation , applying the random phase to objects for widely diffusing the object light is necessary to record the entire object on the kinoform .",
    "when not using the random phase , the reconstructed images from the kinoform are heavy degraded , like edge - only preserved images . in addition , the kinoform can not record an entire object that exceeds the kinoform size because the object light does not widely spread . in order to avoid this degradation and to widely spread the object light ,",
    "the random phase is applied to the kinoform calculation .",
    "although the problem of edge - only images and the narrow spreading object light can be improved by the random phase , the reconstructed image is contaminated by speckle noise .",
    "the well - known methods for improving the speckle noise are the iterative methods @xcite such as gerchberg - saxton ( gs ) algorithm , multi - random phase method @xcite , one step phase retrieval method ( ospr ) @xcite , and pixel separation methods @xcite .",
    "these methods improve the speckle noise ; however , they are time - consuming because the multiple diffraction calculations and plural cghs are needed .",
    "additionally , the multi - random phase method and pixel separation methods require display devices with high - speed refresh rates .",
    "on the other hand , random - phase free methods without time - consuming processing have been proposed : for example , the error diffusion methods @xcite and down - sampling method @xcite .",
    "these methods can reconstruct clear images , not edge - only preserved images ; however , the size of the reconstructed image can not exceed the kinoform size because the object light does not widely spread .",
    "therefore , these methods can not be used for large objects that are required in the applications of holographic projection and three - dimensional display @xcite .",
    "recently , a new random phase - free method using a virtual special convergence light has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this method can reconstruct large images that exceed the cgh size with low speckle noise .",
    "this method is powerful ; however , the effectiveness of the method is only shown in amplitude cgh .    in this paper",
    ", we propose random phase - free kinoform for large objects by the combination of our random phase - free method @xcite and error diffusion methods .",
    "kinoforms generated by the proposed method can reconstruct large images , which exceed the cgh size , with low speckle noise .",
    "to begin with , in fig.[fig : reconst - x1 ] , we show the reconstructed images from kinoforms without random phase , with random phase , and with the error diffusion method proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively . in this simulation",
    ", we use the wavelength of 532 nm , the pixel pitch of 8 @xmath0 m , the resolution of 2,048 @xmath1 2,048 pixels , and the propagation distance of 0.8 m between the kinoform and the image .            in .",
    "fig.[fig : reconst - x1](a ) shows the original image and ( b ) shows the reconstructed image from a kinoform without random phase .",
    "the reconstructed image preserves only the edge information @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : reconst - x1](c ) shows the reconstructed image from a kinoform with random phase , and we can recognize the original information ; however , the image is contaminated by speckle noise .",
    "fig.[fig : reconst - x1](d ) shows the reconstructed image from a kinoform with the error diffusion method @xcite , and the image has the best image quality in these reconstructed images .",
    "unfortunately , as will be shown in section 3 , these methods can not be used in a situation in which the original image size exceeds the kinoform .    in this section ,",
    "we describe how to overcome this problem by the proposed method based on our random phase - free method @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig : propose ] , this method applies virtual spherical convergence light to the input image instead of random phase .",
    "the areas of the image and the kinoform are @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 is the number of pixels for each side of the image , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the sampling pitches on the object and kinoform , respectively . in the proposed method",
    ", we multiply the image @xmath9 by the convergence light given by @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath10 is expressed as a convergence spherical light , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the focal length .",
    "the distance between the object and the kinoform is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the distance between the focus point of the convergence light and the kinoform is denoted by @xmath14 , and is set to the distance at which the kinoform just fits to the cone of the convergence light .",
    "subsequently , we calculate the complex amplitude on the kinoform using , @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the diffraction calculation at the propagation distance @xmath13 .",
    "using a simple geometric relation as shown in fig.[fig : propose ] , we can derive , @xmath17 hence @xmath18 .",
    "see more details in ref .",
    "finally , we obtain the kinoform by , @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicate the use of only the argument part of complex amplitude .",
    "the generated kinoform is shown in fig.[fig : propose](b ) .",
    "our random phase - free method worked well in amplitude cgh ; however , in kinoform , our random phase - free method reconstructs an edge - only preserved image like fig .",
    "[ fig : reconst - x1](b ) . to overcome this problem",
    ", we apply the error diffusion method @xcite to the kinoform .",
    "the error diffusion method we used calculates , @xmath21 where we use floyd - steinberg coefficients @xmath22=7/16 , @xmath23=3/16 , @xmath24=5/16 , and @xmath25=1/16 @xcite , @xmath26 indicates the current value is overwritten , and @xmath27 . before applying the error diffusion",
    ", we may need to normalize the complex amplitude @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the maximum absolute value in the kinoform .",
    "the error diffused kinoform is shown in fig.[fig : propose](c ) .",
    "figure [ fig : reconst - x3 ] shows the reconstructed images from kinoforms without random phase ( fig.[fig : reconst - x3](a ) ) , with random phase ( fig.[fig : reconst - x3](b ) ) , with error diffusion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reconst - x3](c ) ) , with our random phase - free method ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reconst - x3](d ) ) , and with our random phase - free method and error diffusion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reconst - x3](e ) ) .",
    "the calculation conditions are the same as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reconst - x1 ] , except for the sampling pitch on the original image of @xmath31 m . the sampling pitch of the kinoform is @xmath32 m . we used scaled diffraction @xcite to calculate the diffraction calculation from the object to the kinoform at different sampling pitches .",
    "the size of the reconstructed images is expected to be three times ( = @xmath33 ) larger than the kinoform size .",
    "therefore , the kinoform size is 16.4 mm @xmath1 16.4 mm ( @xmath34 m @xmath35@xmath36 m ) , and the sizes of the original and reconstructed images are 49.2 mm @xmath1 49.2 mm ( @xmath37 m @xmath35@xmath38 m ) .",
    "the red dashed boxes indicate the correct image size .    in figs.[fig",
    ": reconst - x3](a ) and ( c ) , these reconstructed images do not have the correct image size because the light from the original image does not spread over the kinoform during the kinoform calculation . in figs.[fig : reconst - x3](b ) , the reconstructed image has the correct image size thanks to the random phase ; however , the speckle noise occurs . in figs.[fig : reconst - x3](d ) , the reconstructed image has the correct image size ; however , it becomes an edge - only preserved image . whereas , the reconstructed image by our random phase - free method and error diffusion method ( fig.[fig : reconst - x3](e ) ) has better image quality and correct image size .",
    "the peak signal - to - noise ratios ( psnrs ) between the original image and these reconstructed images are 10 db ( a ) , 12 db(b ) , 10 db ( c ) , 6 db ( d ) , and 22 db ( e ) , respectively .",
    "all of the results in this paper were obtained by our numerical library for wave optics @xcite .",
    "we proposed random phase - free kinoform for large objects using our random phase - free method @xcite and error diffusion @xcite .",
    "the kinoform calculation for large objects is useful for holographic projection @xcite and holographic three - dimensional display @xcite .",
    "the random phase , which is main generating factor of speckle noise , is necessary in the kinoform calculation of large objects , for reconstructing the correct size .",
    "the proposed method is capable of reconstructing the image with low speckle noise , and is computationally inexpensive .",
