    "has lead to the indirect observation of schrdinger cat states and of their temporal evolutions . in this case the microwave mqs  field stored in the cavity can be addressed indirectly by injecting in the cavity , in a controlled way , resonant or non - resonant atoms as ad hoc measurement mouses  @xcite .",
    "a different approach able to generate freely propagating beams adopts photon - subtracted squeezed states ; experimental implementations of quantum states with an average number of photons of around four have been reported both in the pulsed and continuous wave regimes @xcite .",
    "these states exhibit non - gaussian characteristics and open new perspectives for quantum computing based on continuous - variable ( cv ) systems , entanglement distillation protocols @xcite , loophole free tests of bell s inequality .    in the last few years a novel quantum injected  optical parametric amplification ( qi - opa)process has been realized in order to establish the entanglement between a single photon and a multiphoton state given by an average of many thousands of photons , a schrdinger cat involving a `` macroscopic field '' .",
    "precisely , in a high - gain qi - opa `` phase - covariant '' cloning machine the multiphoton fields were generated by an optical amplifier system bearing a high nonlinear ( nl )  gain @xmath2 and seeded by a single - photon belonging to an epr entangled pair @xcite .",
    "while a first theoretical insight on the dynamical features of the qiopa macrostates and a thorough experimental characterization of the quantum correlations were recently reported @xcite , a complete quantum phase - space analysis able to recognize the persistence of the qi - opaproperties in a decohering environment is still lacking @xcite . among the different representation of quantum states in the continuous - variables space @xcite ,",
    "the wigner quasi - probability representation has been widely exploited as an evidence of non - classical properties , such as squeezing @xcite and epr non - locality bana98 . in particular , the presence of negative quasi - probability regions has been considered as a consequence of the quantum superposition of distinct physical states @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the wigner functions associated to multi - photon states generated by optical parametric amplification of microscopic single photon states .",

    "the negative value of the w - representation in the origin of the phase - space for such states above a certain value of the system - enviroment  interaction parameter , is an evidence of the persistance of quantum properties in presence of decoherence .",
