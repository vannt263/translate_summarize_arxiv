    "<S> the art of imparting information onto a light wave by optical signal modulation is fundamental to all forms of optical communication . among many schemes , </S>",
    "<S> direct modulation of laser diodes stands out as a simple , robust , and cost effective method . </S>",
    "<S> however , the simultaneous changes in intensity , frequency and phase are a drawback which has prevented its application in the field of secure quantum communication . here </S>",
    "<S> , we propose and experimentally demonstrate a directly phase - modulated light source which overcomes the main disadvantages associated with direct modulation and is suitable for diverse applications such as coherent communications and quantum cryptography . </S>",
    "<S> the source separates the tasks of phase preparation and pulse generation between a pair of semiconductor lasers leading to very pure phase states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the cavity enhanced electro - optic effect enables the first example of sub - volt halfwave phase modulation at high signal rates . </S>",
    "<S> the source is compact , stable and versatile , and we show its potential to become the standard transmitter for future quantum communication networks .    </S>",
    "<S> phase modulation is an important encoding format@xcite and forms the basic building block for other signal formats such as amplitude , polarisation @xcite , and quadrature amplitude modulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the primary enabling technology is external modulation , which uses electro - optic materials whose refractive index varies with electric - field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conventional phase modulators based on linbo@xmath0 crystals @xcite or semiconductor waveguides @xcite require driving voltages beyond the reach of complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) logic , necessitating the use of amplifiers which add to the system cost and complexity . </S>",
    "<S> their prospects for a sub - volt halfwave voltage ( @xmath1 ) suitable for direct cmos driving are limited . substantially increasing the device length is both undesirable and difficult . </S>",
    "<S> linbo@xmath0 phase modulators already possess a length of several centimeters , while semiconductor devices suffer from impedance matching problems @xcite and considerable insertion loss at longer lengths . </S>",
    "<S> organic dielectric materials show promising electro - optic coefficients @xcite , but as yet have not resulted in a sub - volt phase modulator @xcite .    in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , which is a powerful method for protecting future communication networks @xcite , the most common way to transmit quantum information </S>",
    "<S> is as an optical phase delay between weak coherent pulses , as this has been shown to be robust even for transmission over installed fiber networks @xcite . for the well - known bb84 protocol , </S>",
    "<S> the phase encoded pulses are usually generated by passing a laser pulse through an asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometer , requiring several discrete free space or fiber optical devices and components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has resulted in a structurally cumbersome transmitter that needs active stabilisation @xcite in addition to requiring powerful driving electronics for phase modulation . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such bb84 encoder is incompatible with other qkd protocols , such as differential - phase - shift @xcite and coherent - one - way @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> direct modulation of laser diodes is attractive because no external modulator is necessary , and it can be achieved with low drive voltages @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , spurious effects such as frequency chirp , large intensity fluctuations , and uncontrolled phase evolution limit its applicability . to date </S>",
    "<S> , it has been used primarily for on - off keying in classical communications with restricted data bandwidth and/or communication distances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although it also produces phase modulation , the dominant amplitude variation makes it non - ideal for state - of - the - art coherent communication systems @xcite . in challenging applications like quantum cryptography , </S>",
    "<S> direct modulation fails altogether , as the unintentional changes in other degrees of freedom leak side - channel information @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a novel concept for a directly phase - modulated light source . </S>",
    "<S> counterintuitively , it employs only laser diodes as active components , but operates on the principle of external modulation by using one diode solely as an electro - optic device for phase control . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting source overcomes disadvantages of direct modulation , while retaining all benefits associated with this technique . </S>",
    "<S> it features an exceptionally low drive voltage , excellent phase stability , and great versatility , making it an attractive choice for many applications , including quantum cryptography , which we will demonstrate .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  1(a ) shows a schematic of our phase - modulated light source , consisting of a pair of laser diodes connected via an optical circulator . </S>",
    "<S> the phase preparation laser is directly modulated to produce a train of nanosecond duration , quasi steady - state emission . </S>",
    "<S> each of these long pulses seeds coherently a block of two ( or more ) secondary , short optical pulses ( @xmath2100 ps ) from the pulse generation laser . </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase of these secondary pulses can be set to an arbitrary value by directly modulating the driving current applied to the phase preparation laser , while their intensity and frequency are essentially unaffected .    </S>",
    "<S> an intuitive picture helps to understand how we prepare an optical phase , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider a steady - state laser with its optical phase evolving at a constant rate of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is its central optical frequency . under a small perturbation , the optical frequency shifts by an amount @xmath5 , changing the course of the phase evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this perturbation will create a phase difference , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the duration of the perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation signal here is an electrical modulation to the phase preparation laser , and the optical frequency change arises from the effect of the carrier density on the refractive index in the active laser medium@xcite . unlike in existing modulators , the phase shift in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) depends on the duration of the modulation signal . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this dependence to cavity enhancement : the laser cavity confinement allows the light field to oscillate back and forth within the cavity and thus experience the refractive - index change of the active medium over the entire duration of a modulation signal . as shown later </S>",
    "<S> , this cavity effect has allowed to realise the first sub - volt @xmath1 phase modulation .    </S>",
    "<S> we use an asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometer ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ) to measure the relative phases of a train of short pulses at 500  ps intervals from the pulse generation laser . </S>",
    "<S> the interval is sufficiently long that the field within the pulse generation laser is extinguished between pulses , such that lasing can be triggered by either spontaneous emission @xcite ( with random phase ) or the phase preparation laser ( with defined phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2(a ) ( right - hand panel ) compares the case where the pulse generation laser is seeded with light from the phase preparation laser to the case where it is unseeded . </S>",
    "<S> the unseeded case produces output waveforms of random intensities , while an injection of continuous - wave light leads to a fixed phase difference resulting in a stable output intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of the phase transfer between the laser diodes is evaluated by the interference visibility of the short pulses , which is found to grow with the injection strength and saturates at 99.06% with a modest injection power of 50  @xmath8w .    </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate phase modulation by applying a small perturbation pattern to the electrical drive of the phase preparation laser , which produces a shallow intensity variation , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b)(i ) . </S>",
    "<S> the key point to note here is that the perturbation does not disrupt the phase continuity , but only changes the phase evolution rate . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of this change by synchronising each modulated signal to the interval of a pair of the output pulses whose relative phase is to be modified . </S>",
    "<S> this arrangement ensures also the indistinguishability among the output pulses , because they will all be seeded by the unmodulated part of the injected light . </S>",
    "<S> the successful transfer of the electrical drive pattern to the output phase is confirmed by the resulting interference waveforms , which reproduce the modulation pattern , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b)(ii ) and ( iii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  2(c ) shows the phase shift measured as a function of the modulation voltage to the phase preparation laser </S>",
    "<S> . the phase shift can be either positive or negative , and is approximately linear with the signal amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we determine a halfwave voltage of 0.35  v. we ascribe this low @xmath1 to the aforementioned cavity enhancement , which enables an effective interaction distance of 25  mm despite the active medium having a length of only @xmath9100@xmath8 m . as </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 is sufficiently low to be driven directly by cmos logic , we expect this breakthrough will significantly reduce the complexity , as well as energy and physical footprint , of a phase - modulated light source .    to highlight the versatility of the source and to demonstrate its practicality as a qkd light source , we introduce phase randomisation by modifying the driving signal to the phase preparation laser . </S>",
    "<S> the driving signal is set below the lasing threshold for 250  ps during each 1  ns period to stop the light emission , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . the depletion of the light field forces the next lasing period to be triggered by the vacuum fluctuation and hence with random phase relative to the previous pulse . </S>",
    "<S> adjacent short pulses seeded by different quasi steady - state pulses will therefore have a random phase as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , whereas pulse pairs by same seed pulse show phase coherence . </S>",
    "<S> our source therefore meets the requirement for global phase randomisation required for the security of the bb84 protocol @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we integrate the source in a bb84 transmitter to demonstrate its suitability for qkd applications . </S>",
    "<S> figure  4(a ) shows the results , where the sifted key rate and quantum bit error rate ( qber ) are directly measured quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values ( symbols ) are in excellent agreement with theoretical simulation ( lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum transmission loss of @xmath940  db ( equivalent to 200  km of standard fiber ) is limited by the detector noise . </S>",
    "<S> the qber stays approximately constant at a base level of 2.4% for channel losses up to 30  db . </S>",
    "<S> this base value sets an upper bound for the encoding error of the light source as a bb84 encoder , which is comparable to the values achieved with conventional bulk or fiber optics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> owing to its interferometer - free design , the phase - modulated source has excellent phase stability . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the complexity of the qkd setup by removing the need for active stabilization of the phase . for illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the qber continuously over a 24-h period with no active feedback applied . the light source , and the receiving interferometer , </S>",
    "<S> are independently temperature - controlled . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent qber , sampled at an interval of 1  s , fluctuates within a very narrow range around an average value of 2.41% with a standard deviation of 0.10% , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the distribution of the measured qber in the inset , together with a simulation of the unavoidable shot - noise statistical fluctuation due to the finite count rate . </S>",
    "<S> the close resemblance between the two distributions suggests that the additional phase instability due to the light source is insignificant .    by simply applying different electrical signals , </S>",
    "<S> the light source can be reconfigured to accommodate a variety of qkd protocols , including differential - phase - shift @xcite and its recent  round - robin \" variant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to implement the coherent - one - way protocol @xcite by introducing a binary pattern in the driving signal to the pulse generation laser . to demonstrate this reconfigurability </S>",
    "<S> , we use the same bb84 optical setup to implement the differential - phase - shift protocol . </S>",
    "<S> figure  4(b ) shows the experimental results ( symbols ) together with the theoretical simulation ( lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the base qber of 1.9% is well within the error threshold of the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> we measure also the performance over a 100  km fiber spool , observing very similar error and bit rates to using the equivalent optical attenuation shown by the grey data points in the plot .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a novel directly modulated light source which permits to prepare very pure phase states with exceptionally low driving voltage and which is suitable for challenging applications such as qkd . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - modulated source could be integrated into a fully - functional phase transmitter with a size comparable to small - form pluggable transceiver modules ( sfps ) ubiquitously found in today s communication systems . </S>",
    "<S> integration at this level is highly desirable , and will find applications in heterogeneous networks where different quantum communication protocols coexist @xcite or in access networks where the compactness and cost of the transmitters is of paramount importance @xcite . beyond communication applications , </S>",
    "<S> the direct source is useful to provide a stable phase - conditioned pulse sequence for the control of quantum systems , such as quantum dots @xcite and parametric down - conversion @xcite . </S>"
