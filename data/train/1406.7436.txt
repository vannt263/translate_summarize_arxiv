    "for a long time , anti - reflective properties have a major importance in the development of optical devices .",
    "for instance , anti - reflective coatings are required when designing telescopes , camera lenses , or glass windows .",
    "such coatings allow e.g. avoiding undesirable reflections in optical imaging @xcite .",
    "moreover , since anti - reflective coatings are wavelength - dependent , they can be used to reject efficiently unwanted radiation , for instance to enhance ultraviolet light protection in sunglasses @xcite . in another context",
    ", superhydrophobicity is a key property for numerous industrial applications @xcite . indeed",
    ", superhydrophobic surfaces can exhibit self - cleaning properties : since water droplets can not stick on such a surface , the rolling drops clear the surface from any impurities @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "an optical device that could combine both anti - reflective and superhydrophobic properties is highly interesting @xcite .",
    "anti - reflection is well known in biological organisms : e.g. nanostructures such as nipple arrays act as an adaptative refractive index layer in moth eyes for instance @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "superhydrophobicity is also well - known in many plants @xcite , for instance in lotus @xcite .",
    "hydrophobic properties and antireflecting nanostructures of cicada wings have been studied independently in previous works @xcite .",
    "although the function as well as the physics of nipple arrays is well documented from the point of view of either antireflection @xcite or hydrophobicity @xcite , the understanding of the role of the geometry in the interplay between optical and wetting properties deserves further investigations .",
    "indeed , the combined aspect of wetting / hydrophobic / anti - reflective properties has not yet been considered as such , strictly speaking .",
    "hereafter , thanks to extensive modeling and measurements , we show that the grey cicada combines both hydrophobic and anti - reflective properties in an entangled two - level nanostructure .",
    "especially , wetting and hydrophobic properties are studied for a wide range of liquids with various surface tensions .",
    "in addition , we determine the complex refractive index of the wing , which is useful and often needed as reference in biophotonics simulations .",
    "the grey cicada ( fig .",
    "1 ) is one of the most frequent cicada species in the south of france .",
    "the studied specimen was captured at als in the cvennes region .",
    "the grey cicada is about @xmath0 mm long and has a @xmath1 mm wing span . in order to investigate the nanostructure of the wing ,",
    "scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) imaging was performed with _ jeol _ @xmath2 _",
    "f _ scanning electron microscope .    both sides of the wing are covered by a hexagonal nipple array ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . each protuberance is a truncated cone , with a hemispherical top ( fig .",
    "protuberances lay on a @xmath3 @xmath4m - thick slab .",
    "this type of protuberance is often encountered in compound eyes or corrugated wings of insects @xcite . according to sem pictures ,",
    "the typical dimensions and geometry of the different parts of the structure can be estimated on average ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . the truncated cone has a circular base of radius @xmath5 nm , and a height @xmath6 nm .",
    "the top hemisphere has a radius @xmath7 nm .",
    "the total height ( cone @xmath8 hemisphere ) is therefore @xmath9 nm . the average hexagonal lattice parameter is @xmath10 nm . we fairly assume that the disorder in the biological structure , i.e. weak deviations with respect to perfect lattice , does not significantly affect the main conclusions of the present study @xcite .",
    "in the following , we highlight the anti - reflective properties of the cicada wing through scattering and transmission measurements . based on models of the wing structure , simulations were performed in order to study the role of the morphology on the optical properties .",
    "the diffusive and polarizing characters of the wing were investigated at incidence angles _ i _ of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 using scatterometry in transmittance mode ( _ eldim ezcontrast _",
    ". this scatterometer uses fourier lenses to record the bidirectional transmittance or reflectance distribution function ( btdf or brdf ) of the sample ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) at visible wavelengths . in order to detect possible polarization of the emerging light ,",
    "a polarizer was placed as analyzer as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . in a first step ( calibration )",
    ", at each incidence angle , the btdf of the incident beam alone ( without wing and polariser ) was measured , showing purely specular transmittance as expected ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) . in a second step ,",
    "the wing was inserted and the polarizer was positioned perpendicular ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) to the wing longitudinal axis and then parallel to it ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "btdfs of the wing for both analyzed polarizations were recorded . at each incidence angle _",
    "i _ , both btdf maps were compared to the btdf map of the incident beam alone . as polarization effects should be observed preferably at large incidence angles , the results in fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) are presented for the incidence angle _",
    "i _ of @xmath17 degrees ( and a wavelength @xmath18 @xmath19 510 nm in the middle of visible range ) . accordingly ,",
    "neither diffusive effects nor polarizing effects of the wing could be detected ( fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) ) . results ( not shown ) were identical for the other wavelengths in the visible spectrum ( according to the characteristics of our scatterometer ) .",
    "since the wing exhibited a very low diffusive character and in order to optimize the signal to noise ratio , transmission properties are mainly emphasized hereafter by contrast with reflection properties .",
    "measurement of the wing optical properties spectrum were performed at normal incidence using a double beam spectrophotometer ( _ perkin elmer lambda _",
    "@xmath20 _ s _ _ uv / vis / nir _ ) and an integrating sphere . in fig .",
    "5(a ) , reflection spectrum is shown .",
    "since reflection is very weak , measurement was made with the wing on a black substrate ( certified reflectance standard srs-02 - 020 _ labsphere _ with a reflectance factor of 2@xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 nm ) .",
    "the measured reflection @xmath24 had to corrected since @xmath24 was fairly approximated by @xmath25 ( see insert in fig .",
    "5(a ) ) where @xmath26 was the expected wing reflection , @xmath27 was the black substrate reflection ( which was measured independently , not shown ) , and @xmath28 was the free - standing wing transmission which is measured independently ( see hereafter ) . in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the blue dashed curve is @xmath24 whereas the black solid curve is @xmath26 which is deduced from the above expression .",
    "this correction confirms that reflection values are weak in accordance with previous results @xcite , and must be derived carefully .",
    "in addition , it is well - known that spectroscopic measurements are impacted by instrumental noise for low transmittance or reflectance levels . as a consequence , it is more relevant to compare high - level transmittance measurements with numerical models , rather than low - level reflectance measurements .",
    "let us now consider transmission measurements .",
    "they were carried out on free - standing wings i.e without substrate . the black curve in fig .",
    "5(b ) indicates an almost perfect transmission in the visible range although it appears to be weaker on the blue side than on the red side of the spectrum .",
    "this means that almost 100% of the light passes through the free - standing wing without being absorbed or reflected .",
    "the transmission exhibits a large drop below 350 nm , due to a strong intrinsic absorption in the ultra - violet range .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "5(a ) we found that reflection does not fade away at these wavelengths . using the absorption coefficient calculated from reflection and transmission at each wavelength",
    ", the spectrum of the imaginary part of the complex refractive index was deduced from the beer - lambert law @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "in order to reveal the effect of the nipple array on the optical properties , the wing was covered with a calibrated refractive - index oil . indeed , provided that the oil refractive index matches the refractive index of the protuberances , the oil filling the air cavities and the material can be regarded as a single planar layer . here , a decrease of transmission was noted using a calibrated commercial oil with a real part of refractive index equal to @xmath29 ( see blue dashed curve on fig .",
    "this oil is certified by the manufacturer _ cargille labs _ ( also verified by us ) with a negligible dispersion on the visible range and a weak dispersion in the ultraviolet domain .",
    "such a refractive - index value is consistent with that of chitin @xcite . as a result , in the following",
    ", we will assume that the cicada wing is made of a chitin - like compound with an average refractive index of @xmath29 . on fig .",
    "5(b ) , the blue dashed curve ( transmission spectrum of wing immersed in index matching oil ) shows a transmission drop of @xmath30% in the visible range and spectral changes in the uv range .",
    "one can then conclude that the nipple array increases the transmission by @xmath30% , improving the transparency of the wing .",
    "these results are in agreement with those obtained by other authors @xcite . since uv absorption of the chitin material was determined , the absorption coefficient of the wing ( extrapolated from experimental measurement ) ( fig .",
    "5(c ) ) will be used in the following numerical simulations .    /sr",
    "results are shown for polar angles ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath31 and azimuthal angles in ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath32 .",
    "the wavelength is @xmath33 = @xmath34 nm . a : principle of the scatterometer .",
    "b : btdf of the incident beam at an angle of incidence @xmath35 .",
    "c , d : btdf of the cicada wing at @xmath35 and for two orthogonal analyzing polarizer orientations , @xmath11 ( panel ( c ) ) and @xmath36 ( panel ( d)).,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ]                 on the basis of morphological data , we described the wing as a homogeneous slab with , on both side , a hexagonal array of truncated cones with top hemisphere ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the wing was made of chitin only .",
    "the real part of the refractive index was taken equal to @xmath29 and was assumed to be constant all over the simulation spectral range whereas the absorption coefficient was taken wavelength - dependent according to data shown in fig .",
    "simulations of the optical properties were carried out from the near uv to the near infrared ( @xmath37 to @xmath38 nm ) by using a transfer matrix code @xcite .",
    "since the nipple array has subwavelength dimensions , the corrugated layer can be considered as a continuous effective material with a graded - index along its thickness .",
    "more specifically , the effective dielectric constant can then be defined by @xcite :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the dielectric constant of air ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is the dielectric constant of chitin and @xmath43 is filling factor given by :    @xmath44    with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the radius of the circular section of a nipple at coordinate @xmath47 .",
    "while light propagation in corrugated layers is computed thanks to the transfer matrix code , light propagation in the homogeneous thick slab is calculated using an analytical expression based on fresnel equations in which phases are set to zero in order to mimic optical incoherence . indeed ,",
    "structural imperfections in the slab , which is a thick biological layer , tend to break constructive light wave interferences . finally , although we choose to focus on transmission for the reasons we exposed previously , simulations of reflection are also performed to corroborate our results .",
    "simulation results for transmission are shown in fig .",
    "the black curve corresponds to the measured transmission whereas the red curve corresponds to the simulated transmission : the two curves match very well .",
    "this result is valid whatever the polarization state is . in order to discriminate the role of the truncated cone and the role of the top hemisphere ,",
    "two alternative wing models were considered .",
    "we first considered a truncated cone without the hemisphere on top ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . fig .",
    "6(b ) shows the simulated spectrum ( red curve ) and the measured spectrum ( black curve ) . both transmission spectra match quite well , showing that the hemisphere does not actually contribute to the transparency of the wing . in a second simulation",
    ", we considered a cylinder ( instead of a cone ) ( see fig .",
    "3 ( c ) ) with a hemisphere on top .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "the simulated transmission ( red curve ) is significantly lower than the measured one ( black curve ) . together with the previous simulation",
    ", this result shows that the truncated cone is required to get transparency in the visible range .",
    "this can be easily understood since the truncated cone avoids a sudden change in the refractive index when light impinges on the slab . indeed , considering eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the truncated cone creates a gradient of refractive index which acts as an optical impedance adaptation layer .",
    "let us now consider the simulated reflection .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "the measured ( black dash - dotted curve ) and simulated ( red dashed curve ) reflections exhibit comparable values about @xmath48% .",
    "nevertheless , we note that spectra of both reflections do not perfectly match .",
    "as explained previously , this can be explained by the lack of accuracy when measuring weak reflections .",
    "we also present the simulated reflection for the wing model without hemispheres ( cyan solid curve ) . as for the transmission ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) , there is negligible difference ( less than @xmath49% ) with the full wing model ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . now , by contrast , if we consider the model with cylinders instead of truncated cones , we see that the reflection increases by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "this corroborates qualitatively our results obtained with the transmission ( fig .",
    "6(c ) ) . in addition",
    ", we note the strong oscillations of the simulated reflection , since the array of cylinders acts as a thin effective homogeneous slab where interferences can occur .",
    "in this section , contact angle measurements are reported and wettability regimes are investigated .",
    "analytical models are used to describe the superhydrophobicity of the wing .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=7 ]     corresponds to the young s contact angle for a flat chitin surface .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=7 ]      a surface can be classified as superhydrophobic if the contact angle of a water droplet on the surface is higher than @xmath51@xmath52 .",
    "if the contact angle lies between 90@xmath52 and @xmath51@xmath52 , the surface is only hydrophobic and it is hydrophilic if the contact angle lies between @xmath53@xmath52 and @xmath54@xmath52 . in the present case , the contact angle of a water droplet on the wing surface",
    "is measured to be @xmath55@xmath52 ( fig .",
    "8) . as a consequence ,",
    "the wing of _ cicada orni _ is almost superhydrophobic . according to previous works related to the link between nanostructure and superhydrophobicity @xcite",
    ", we can fairly assess that the nipple array covering the wing surface is responsible for its hydrophobic properties ( see fig .",
    "indeed , without the nanostructure , the water droplet would probably spread on the surface since the contact angle of water on a flat chitin surface is about @xmath56 @xcite .    for a better understanding of the wing hydrophobicity ,",
    "it is relevant to measure the wetting properties for various liquids with different surface tensions . for this purpose , we used ethanol - water solutions with different mass percentages of ethanol ( from 0% to 100% ) , but also a @xmath57 m sodium chloride aqueous solution and mercury .",
    "the effective contact angle @xmath58 for each liquid on the wing ( the nanostructured surface ) was measured , and @xmath59 was plotted against @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the contact angle on a flat chitin surface ( fig .",
    "10 ; black dots correspond to measured values ) .",
    "since the liquid - gas surface tension @xmath62 of the used liquids are known @xcite , and since the solid - gas surface tension @xmath63 of chitinous material can be calculated ( see further ) , it is possible to calculate the contact angle @xmath64 for a given liquid on a flat chitinous surface , using the young equation @xcite : @xmath65 knowing that solid / liquid surface tension @xmath66 can be approximated by @xcite : @xmath67 we then get @xmath68 from eqs ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . since @xmath62 of water is known , as well as the contact angle of a water droplet on flat chitinous surface ( @xmath69 ) @xcite , we deduce from ( 3 ) @xmath70 n@xmath71m@xmath72 . in fig .",

    "specifically , they are used to describe the superhydrophobic , hydrophobic or hydrophilic behavior of the wing .",
    "two theoretical models are considered : the cassie - baxter model for the hydrophobicity regime and wenzel model for the hydrophilic regime .    the cassie - baxter ( cb ) model @xcite allows to describe the wetting process on superhydrophobic and hydrophobic surfaces according to their roughness ( i.e. nipple array ) . for a surface made of two different materials with different coverage areas ,",

    "using the nipple geometry previously described , we consider the wetting model shown on fig .",
    "the contact angle in the present case can be written as @xcite :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the number of hemispheres per unit area for a hexagonal array , @xmath86 is the radius of the hemisphere , and @xmath87 is the contact angle of a droplet deposited on flat chitin .",

    "9(a ) ) is not truly a planar one , modifying then the conditions for which the gibbs energy is minimized @xcite .",

    "we note that , using eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we find a theoretical contact angle of @xmath92 for water by contrast with the measured value of @xmath93 , i.e there is less than 4% difference between theory and experiment .    in order to clearly demonstrate the essential role of the hemispherical top",
    ", we investigated the wetting properties of the conical base structure without the top hemisphere ( fig .",
    "9(b ) ) . in this case",
    ", the cassie - baxter contact angle is simply given by : @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the linear dependence , which is plotted in fig .",
    "10 as a black solid line , leads to much less satisfactory agreement with data , as compared with the quadratic dependence ( purple curve ) pertaining to the hemispherical top , i.e. eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "indeed , for water ( @xmath87 = @xmath56 ) , a theoretical contact angle of @xmath97 = @xmath98 is predicted by eq .",
    "( 8) , whereas a value of @xmath92 was determined previously by eq .",
    "therefore , only the model including the hemispherical top is able to account for the superhydrophobicity of the wing .",
    "the hydrophilic behavior of a corrugated surface , on the other hand , can be described thanks to the wenzel ( w ) model @xcite . in this case , the contact angle is given by :    @xmath99    where r@xmath100 is the roughness factor which is in our case given by :    @xmath101    with @xmath96 , @xmath86 the radius of the hemisphere , @xmath102 the radius of the base of the cone , @xmath103 the length of the cone ( @xmath104 nm ) and @xmath105 the spatial period . equation ( 8) is a linear relation between the effective contact angle and the contact angle on a flat surface made of the same material .",
    "( 9 ) is plotted as blue curve with @xmath106 , using geometrical parameters mentioned in section ii and measured from sem pictures . here , the model matches very well with the experimental data .",
    "we emphasize the fact that the wetting models underline the role of the top hemisphere in the wetting phenomena , and especially in the hydrophobic behavior of the cicada wings . in the wetting regime , the whole structure geometry must be considered to explain the wetting .",
    "while it is known that cicada wings possess both hydrophobic @xcite and anti - reflective properties @xcite , in the present work we underlined the two - in - one character of the geometrical features leading both to the optical and wetting properties of the cicada . from scanning electron microscopy , it was shown that the cicada wing consisted of a thick chitinous layer whose each side was covered by a nanostructured device in the form of an hexagonal nipple array .",
    "each nipple was modeled by a truncated cone topped by an hemisphere .",
    "we performed an original wetting experiment with various chemical species as well as comprehensive optical measurements providing the complex refractive index of the chitinous wing . from optical simulations and using an analytical wetting model , we demonstrated the character of the two functional levels of the nipple array .",
    "we concluded that the hemisphere on the top of the nipple was useful for the superhydrophobic character of the cicada wing .",
    "this half - sphere played no optical role . by contrast , the truncated cone played no significant role in the hydrophobic behavior while it was found to be fundamental for ensuring transparency of the cicada wing ( anti - reflection ) .",
    "therefore , the nipple array nanostructure in the grey cicada can be considered as a two - in - one device : a hemisphere top which allows a strong water repellency and a truncated cone which ensures anti - reflective properties .",
