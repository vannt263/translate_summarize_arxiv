    "imaginary potential usually appears in a system to describe physical processes phenomenologically due to its simplicity , which has been investigated under the non - hermitian quantum mechanics framework klaiman1,znojil , makris , musslimani , bender 08,jentschura , fan , a.m38,a.m391,a.m392 . to discuss and explore the usefulness of the imaginary potential",
    ", one has to be able to establish a correspondence between a non - hermitian system and a real physical system in an analytically exact manner .",
    "the effort to establish a parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetric quantum theory as a complex extension of the conventional quantum mechanics @xcite was stimulated by the discovery that a non - hermitian hamiltonian with simultaneous @xmath0 symmetry  has an entirely real quantum - mechanical energy spectrum @xcite and has profound theoretical and methodological implications .",
    "when speaking of physical significance of a non - hermitian hamiltonian , it is implicitly assumed that there exists another hermitian hamiltonian which shares the complete or partial spectrum with it .",
    "thus one of the ways of extracting the physical meaning of a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian having a real spectrum is to seek for its hermitian counterparts a.m38,a.m391,a.m392 .",
    "the metric - operator theory outlined in @xcite provides a mapping of such a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian to an equivalent hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "however , the obtained equivalent hermitian hamiltonian is usually quite complicated @xcite and can not be judged whether it describes real physics or is just unrealistic mathematical object .    in this paper",
    ", we try to find an alternative way to establish the connection between a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian and a physics system .",
    "we consider a simple class of discrete systems , which are originally exploited to describe the solid - state system in condensed matter physics . in such systems",
    ", the imaginary potential usually appears as source or sink , acting as connection to the outer world . in this sense ,",
    "the eigenstates of an unbroken @xmath2  non - hermitian hamiltonian seem to be the dynamical equilibrium states of an open system .",
    "the strategy of this paper is to seek the ways of analytical continuation of the eigenfunctions of a @xmath0 * *  * * non - hermitian hamiltonian into the stationary scattering states of an extended hermitian system .",
    "it indicates that the @xmath0 eigenstate of a @xmath0  non - hermitian hamiltonian  has connection to the resonance transmission state of the extended hermitian hamiltonian .",

    "v is the summary and discussion .",
    "the first problem we address in our search for physically meaningful @xmath1 * *  * * non - hermitian hamiltonian is how to associate the individual imaginary potential with the hermitian sub - network .",
    "recently the formal theory of scattering for complex potentials in one dimension continuous system has been constructed ( for review see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . to establish such a correspondence in a discrete system , we consider a simple model described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "it is a tight - binding chain with uniform nearest neighbor hopping integrals and an additional imaginary on - site potential on a site of a semi - infinite chain , which can be written as follows : @xmath4where @xmath5 is the creation operator of the boson ( or fermion ) at the @xmath6th site , the tunneling strengths and imaginary potential are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  and @xmath9 @xmath10 .",

    ", the conclusion will be obtained is applicable for a large class of systems .    to investigate the role of the imaginary potential in a discrete system ,",

    "we will show that , such a scattering process can occur in a hermitian system .",
    "it has been well known that an imaginary potential , by means of an effective interaction , can serve as a reduced description for the outer world of an open system . along this line",
    ", we consider a similar lattice system to @xmath3 , described by a _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "in this network , the imaginary potential is replaced by a real potential @xmath24 , and a semi - infinite chain is added , which acts as the complementary subspace or outer word if @xmath25 is regarded as an open system .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has the form @xmath26where @xmath27 is also the creation operator of the boson ( or fermion ) at the @xmath6th site . @xmath28 and",

    "for the the same incident plane wave @xmath14 , we have    @xmath37    and furthermore , one can find that under the conditions@xmath38the solutions for @xmath18  and @xmath39  are identical .",
    "the above equivalent conditions can also be given in the energy - dependent form    @xmath40    where @xmath41 .",
    "then the wave functions ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) within @xmath42 $ ] are the same .",
    "this indicates that for the incident plane wave @xmath14 ,  the imaginary potential can be regarded as a semi - infinite chain for wave escaping .",
    "it is worth to point out that it is a conditional equivalence , which is only for the specific state .",
    "this equivalence is the building block for the investigation of this paper .",
    "now we consider the relevant situations derived from the obtained results .",
    "we are interested in the case when the imaginary potential is source like .",
    "actually , applying time - reversal operation on the above scattering processes , i.e. , taking complex conjugation for the eqs .",
    "( [ h_g ] ) and ( [ h_v ] ) , the corresponding time reversal solutions can be obtained , which are illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c , d ) .",
    "1(c ) shows that the time reversal solution is for the new system @xmath43 .",

    "1(b ) . based on the processes in real physical systems illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b , c ) ,  the physics of the imaginary potential becomes clear : @xmath9 acts as a drain lead , while @xmath44acts as a source lead associated with an incoming plane wave .",
    "although this is not a surprising result , we still verify it explicitly in a strict manner and will apply it to a @xmath0 * *  * * non - hermitian system .",
    "the above result is essentially about the stationary state for the infinite non - hermitian system .",
    "intuitively , a source and drain could produce a stationary state in a finite system between them when the gain rate equals to the loss rate , or in an open system  with injecting sources and absorbing sinks .",
    "the conceptual framework is required to substantiate this idea . in this section ,",
    "we consider the stationary state of a non - hermitian system based on the obtained scattering solutions of the imaginary potential .",
    "although we can not get the explicit solution about the reflection amplitude @xmath45 , the corresponding time - reversal process illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) exhibits the facts : for an incident plane wave with amplitude @xmath46 , the reflected amplitude from the absorptive potential @xmath9  is @xmath47 , while for an incident plane wave with amplitude @xmath48 , the reflected amplitude from the source potential @xmath44  is just @xmath46 .",
    "the fact @xmath49  indicates that if we combine the building blocks fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( c ) to construct a finite network with the geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the stationary state may be formed in the manner : a wave coming from the sources and send back its time - reversed version . on the other hand ,",
    "such a configuration has the @xmath1  symmetry spontaneously , which has been shown to process real - energy eigenstate under certain condition . in the aid of its hermitian counterpart shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , one can find that in the case of the stationary state being formed , it just corresponds to the resonant transmission .",
    "therefore the existence of the real - energy eigenstate of a @xmath1  symmetric system is connected to the occurrence of resonant transmission in a hermitian system .",
    "it follows that we can find an alternative hermitian counterpart to a @xmath0  symmetric hamiltonian in the sense that they share the same eigenfunction within the common region",
    ". this should be the way more directly associated with the physics of the @xmath0  symmetric system . in the following sections",

    "in this section , we investigate a simple exactly solvable system to illustrate the main idea of this paper . in order to exemplify the above mentioned analysis of relating the stationary states of a non - hermitian @xmath1  symmetric hamiltonian and a hermitian one , we take @xmath50  to be the simplest network : a uniform chain",
