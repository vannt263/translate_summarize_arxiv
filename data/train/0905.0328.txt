    "although there have been a lot of progresses on constructing phenomenologically viable models based on theories with extra spatial dimensions , some fundamental questions have not been completely solved .",
    "one of them is the moduli stabilization problem .",
    "the size and shape of compact space described by dynamical moduli fields have to be fixed in order to avoid any conflict with astronomical observations .",
    "in addition to these problems , we also face the challenges from cosmology in explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "one possible solution for these problems may involve arguments based on anthropic principle .",
    "however , the search for an alternative solution is still going on , for example in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was suggested that casimir energy from various field fluctuations in compact extra dimensions could play a crucial role in addressing these significant problems @xcite .",
    "greene and levin @xcite argued that if the total casimir energy is properly chosen , then it is possible , at least in the case of vacuum dominated universe , to stabilize the size of the extra dimensions and drive the accelerated expansion of the three non - compacted directions in which the casimir energy plays the role of dark energy .",
    "the authors in @xcite employed the calculation of casimir energy in the non - trivial space , @xmath0 and demonstrated that the shape of extra dimensions can also be stabilized by the same mechanism .",
    "interestingly , predictions in this scenario such as radius of extra dimensions and quantum gravity scale in the bulk are in agreement with those from the large extra dimensions or add scenario @xcite .",
    "hence , the moduli stabilization problem , dark energy problem and the hierarchy problem may possibly be explained in the single unified framework .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in @xcite , there are some crucial obstructions to realizing a phenomenological viable version of this scenario",
    ". one of them is that the extra dimension fails to stabilize if we include contribution from matter contents . during the matter",
    "dominant epoch , energy density of non - relativistic matter was the dominant contribution in the effective potential of the moduli fields and washed away the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "although the minimum reappears in the vacuum dominated epoch , the moduli ( i.e. radion field ) has already passed the dynamical stable fixed point .",
    "this causes the extra dimension to expand and contradicts with our observation .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to investigate whether this technical problem could be solved .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the new stabilization mechanism based on the casimir energy and the existence of the lorentz violating  ther \" field in the compact direction . starting with the simplest model with one extra dimension where the space - like ther field lives in the compact circle similar to the model considered in @xcite",
    ", we claim that non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the ther field would affect the dynamical equation of background moduli field .",
    "it can reduce the gradient of the radion s potential and slows down the oscillation frequency .",
    "this ensures stability of extra dimension although there is non - relativistic ( dark ) matter in the universe . as in the previous works , the casimir energy of massless and massive fields embedded in five - dimensional space play a role of dark energy and",
    "drive the expansion of non - compact space as expected .",
    "note that the effect of a time - like ther field on slowing down the expansion rate of the universe was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the effects of the ther fields on cosmological observable was studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite also studied the role of ther field on the stability of the extra dimension in the context of braneword scenario but in a different aspect .",
    "it is important to state that we are aware of the stability issue for space - like ther field @xcite which may cause difficulty in the construction of a more realistic model of this scenario .",
    "however the interplay between the ther field and the dynamical moduli field in our model may shed some light on the connection between the dimensionality of spacetime and the violation of lorentz symmetry .",
    "perhaps nature allows us to observe only the large three - dimensional space that preserves lorentz symmetry but conceals the lorentz violating directions in the compact space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ aether ] , we start by reviewing the ther model in 5-dimensional spacetime . in section",
    "[ cosmology ] , we derive cosmological equations of motion in 5-dimensional spacetime with ther field and write down effective 4-dimensional equations of motion in the radion picture",
    ". then we review the calculation of casimir energy and extend to the case involving interaction between ther field and bulk fields in section [ casimir ] . in section [ stability ] , we investigate the role of ther field in the context of stabilization of the extra dimension both in the vacuum dominated universe and in the universe with non - relativistic matter . finally we summarize our results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we start by considering a 5-dimensional flat spacetime with coordinates @xmath1 where @xmath2 and with mostly plus metric signature .",
    "we assume that the fifth direction is compactified on a circle .",
    "now we consider a toy model in which lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ther field @xmath3 i.e. a vector field with a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "most of the ther models contain kinetic term that makes their hamiltonian unbounded from below and their stability is a subtle issue @xcite .",
    "here we consider the action with maxwell - type kinetic term @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 has a familiar form to the field strength tensor of electromagnetism .",
    "however , the ther field @xmath6 is not related to the electromagnetic vector field @xmath7 and its dynamics does not respect @xmath8 gauge symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the second term in the above action enforces the ther field to have a constant norm @xmath9 where @xmath10 acts as a lagrange multiplier and we take @xmath11 . in our unit",
    "@xmath6 has dimension of mass@xmath12 .",
    "the sum @xmath13 in ( [ aether_action ] ) represent various interaction terms which couple the ther field to matter fields that we will discuss later in this section .",
    "if we neglect the interaction terms for the moment , the equations of motion for the ther field @xmath6 can be written as @xmath14 any solutions for which @xmath15 will solve the equation of motion ( [ u_eom ] ) . in order to preserve lorentz invariance in the 4-dimensional non - compact space",
    ", we choose the background solution such that the ther is a space - like vector field which has non - vanishing components along the extra fifth dimension , @xmath16 it is important to note that there is a subtle stability issue here .",
    "although our aim is to investigate the role of the ther field on the stability of the extra dimension , the model of space - like ther field with maxwell - type kinetic term itself is _ unstable _ @xcite .",
    "however , for our purpose , we can consider it as _ a toy model _ and assume that there is some mechanism which stabilizes the ther field .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the ther field @xmath17 takes the following form @xmath18 note that properties of the ther field depend crucially on spacetime geometry . the flat space background solution in equation ( [ flatspace ] )",
    "gives @xmath19 .",
    "however , in curved spacetime , the ther field can give rise to non - vanishing energy momentum tensor for example a time - like ther field can produce energy density @xcite while a space - like ther gives the stress components @xcite . the case of an ther field oriented along the compact extra dimension was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that such ther configuration can also give rise to non - vanishing energy momentum tensor .",
    "however , @xmath20 vanishes when the extra dimension is stabilized .",
    "we will review this result in the next section .",
    "we now consider the effect of the interaction term @xmath21 in ( [ aether_action ] ) which in general can include the terms corresponding to the ther field coupled to scalars , fermions and gravity .",
    "however , we will consider stabilization mechanism of the extra dimension involving casimir energy of gravitons , bulk scalars and bulk fermions .",
    "we will ignore the bulk vector terms .",
    "let us begin with the effect of the interaction of the ther with a real massive scalar field @xmath22 .",
    "the lagrangian for the scalar field with the minimal coupling term is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coupling parameters with dimension of mass@xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion for the scalar field takes the form @xcite@xmath25 expanding the scalar field in fourier modes @xmath26 , we obtain the modified dispersion relation , @xmath27 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath28 is the ratio of the aether vev to the coupling @xmath29 .",
    "next we consider the fermion terms .",
    "the lagrangian for fermionic field with the minimal coupling term can be written as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath29 is the fermionic coupling constant with the unit of mass@xmath12 . in the same spirit as in the scalar field case",
    ", the corresponding modification of the dispersion relation for the fermionic case can be written as @xmath31 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the form of this equation is different from the analogous equation in the bosonic case : i.e. the second term on the right - handed side increases by @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 . finally , we consider the ther field which couples non - minimally to gravity .",
    "this can be described by the action @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dimensionless graviton coupling constant and @xmath37 is the planck mass in 5 dimensional space - time . by varying this action with respect to the metric tensor",
    ", we obtain the equation of motion @xmath38 with @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the 5-dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "let us consider small fluctuation of the metric @xmath41 following the explanation in @xcite , the metric perturbation can be decomposed into @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 presents the propagating modes of the gravitational wave , @xmath45 denotes the newtonian gravitational field and @xmath46 is a component associated with the radion field describing the modes of the extra dimension . by setting @xmath47 , and considering transverse waves , @xmath48 ,",
    "the gravitational equation of motion becomes @xmath49 let us define @xmath50 .",
    "the above equation gives the modified dispersion relation for graviton @xmath51",
    "in this section we consider cosmological dynamics of 5-dimensional spacetime by applying einstein general relativity to the product space , between 4-dimensional frw - type spacetime and a circle @xmath52 .",
    "we assume the cosmological ansatz @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the scale factor of non - compact 3-dimensional space , and @xmath56 denotes the radius of the compact fifth direction .",
    "the coordinates on @xmath52 are @xmath57 . for our metric ( [ metric ] ) , the background solution for the equation of motion ( [ u_eom ] ) can be written as @xmath58 using this background solution , the energy momentum tensor associated to the ther field defined in ( [ t_u ] ) can be written as @xmath59 we have defined the hubble constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where dotted quantities represent the corresponding time derivative . as we mentioned in the previous section , @xmath62 when the extra dimension is stabilized @xmath63 . the fact that the ther field does not contribute to the energy density at the stabilized point implies that the ther field will not give any contribution to the effective potential of the radion . hence other component such as casimir energy is needed for stabilization of the extra dimension . however , as we shall see later on , the ther field can reduce the influence of the casimir force .",
    "this property is important for stabilization mechanism when non - relativistic matter is present .",
    "let us assume that the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath64 is decomposed into @xmath65 the contribution from non - minimally coupling to gravity @xmath66 is defined in equation ( [ t_cg ] ) .",
    "the component @xmath67 represents contribution from casimir energy @xcite .",
    "casimir energy density @xmath68 plays the role of 5-dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are the pressure density in non - compact and compact direction respectively . by substituting @xmath71 into the einstein field equation",
    ", we get the 5-dimensional cosmological equations of motion @xmath72 where @xmath73 .      since we are interested in our observed universe , it is useful to analyze the cosmological dynamics by considering 4-dimensional effective field theory .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eom1])-([eom3 ] ) can be obtained by varying the 5-dimensional einstein - hilbert action @xmath74 @xmath75 denotes the potential term in 5-dimensional spacetime .",
    "note that we omit the lagrange multiplier term . for simplicity",
    ", we will set @xmath76 in this section and this will not affect our main results . let us start with kk - dimensional reduction of the above action from @xmath77 to @xmath78-dimensional spacetime .",
    "then , in order to make the resulting effective action in the canonical form , we apply weyl rescaling @xmath79 @xmath80 and define the new time variable @xmath81 , @xmath82 ; @xmath83 . note that @xmath84 is the planck mass in 4-dimensional spacetime defined via the relation @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the stabilized radius of extra dimension . thus @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",

    "this action gives rise to the following set of equations : @xmath95 note that @xmath96 is the hubble constant in the einstein frame .",
    "as we will explain later , the factor @xmath97 in the right - handed side of equation ( [ reom2 ] ) weakens the effect of the potential gradient @xmath98 and it is crucial for stabilization mechanism of the radion field @xmath99 . to make contact with previous section",
    ", we note that the energy - momentum tensor associated with 5-dimensional action in ( [ action5d ] ) gives the relations @xmath100",
    "we will start this section by reviewing the mathematical formulation to determine the casimir energy for a scalar field , @xmath101 , and then investigating the effect of ther coupling to the casimir energy .",
    "first , we consider casimir energy of a non - interacting scalar field of mass , @xmath102 , in @xmath103 spacetime by following @xcite . we keep the number of non - compact spatial directions to be @xmath104 for the moment and",
    "will set @xmath105 at the end of our calculation .",
    "this scalar field obeys the free klein - gordon equation , @xmath106 the scalar field satisfies the periodic boundary condition in the compact direction , @xmath107 .",
    "its associated dispersion relation can be written as @xmath108 where , @xmath109 is the momentum number in the compact direction .",
    "then , the total vacuum energy contributing to casimir energy can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the spatial volume of non - compact spacetime .",
    "using the fact that @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath113 where we define @xmath114 .",
    "let us consider the massless case , @xmath115 . by using the zeta function regularization procedure ,",
    "the casimir energy density per one bosonic degree of freedom for massless scalar field can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the zeta function and we take @xmath118 to be the volume of compact dimension .",
    "for the massive case , we apply the chowla - selberg zeta function @xcite in our regularization procedure and obtain the casimir energy density per one degree of freedom for the massive scalar field : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom will contribute to the casimir energy density with the same expression except for an extra minus sign .",
    "let us consider the case that a scalar field couples to an ther field with a coupling constant @xmath121 . in the previous section , we showed that interaction with the ther field transforms the usual dispersion relation ( [ normal_dp ] ) into its modified version ( [ sdis ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the casimir energy will be written as @xmath122 where we rescale @xmath123 and @xmath102 in such a way that @xmath124 and @xmath125 . by comparing @xmath126 with the non - interacting casimir energy @xmath101",
    ", we see that the ther coupling rescales the casimir energy and scalar mass by factors @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "thus , we can immediately write down the casimir energy density per one bosonic degrees of freedom with the ther coupling @xmath129 as @xmath130 for contributions from massless and massive scalar fields respectively . other bosonic degrees of freedom contribute to the total casimir energy in a similar way but with different coupling constants and masses . for example",
    ", the graviton in ( @xmath131)-dimensional spacetime has @xmath132 bosonic degrees of freedom with the ther coupling @xmath36 and mass @xmath115 . using the modified dispersion relation for graviton ( [ gdis ] ) , we can show that the graviton contributes @xmath133 to the total casimir energy density .",
    "recall that , apart from modification of graviton s casimir energy , non - minimal coupling of the ther field to gravity can also affect the dynamical evolution through the energy momentum tensor @xmath134 .",
    "for fermion case , we use the modified dispersion relation for the fermionic field in ( [ fdis ] ) .",
    "we can show that the associated casmir energy density per one fermionic degree of freedom , for both massless and massive case , is in the similar form of those from bosinic degrees of freedom with the over all minus sign and @xmath135 .",
    "the casimir energy densities for one degree of freedom of massless and massive fermion can be written respectively as @xmath136 the total casimir energy density can be written in terms of sum over all degrees of freedom : @xmath137 where @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) are the numbers of bosonic ( fermionic ) degrees of freedom for massless and massive fields respectively .",
    "the nature of the total casimir energy density depends on the relative magnitude of @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    in our model , @xmath142 since , at least , the graviton is always present and it has five physical degrees of freedom in five - dimensional spacetime ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the compact fifth direction would not be stable if there is only the graviton field in the bulk , i.e. it will collapse to planck size , due to the negative casimir energy associated with quantum fluctuations of the gravitation fields .",
    "therefore , it is natural to add more positive contribution to the casimir energy by assuming that there are fermions in the bulk . however , we can not create the minimum of @xmath68 by including only the massless fermionic fields i.e. the casimir force is attractive for @xmath144 and becomes repulsive when @xmath145 .",
    "hence @xmath146 does not give us any stable fixed point .",
    "we should expect a minimum to be produced if we include massive fermionic degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "this can be explained qualitatively as the following .",
    "let us consider casimir energy of a fermion with mass @xmath147 .",
    "for the region where @xmath148 , the vacuum energy should have the same form as in the massless case .",
    "in particular , for @xmath145 , the net casimir force will be repulsive . in the other region where @xmath149 , the contribution from the massive fermion mode is negligible compared to that of the graviton and the total casimir force becomes attractive .",
    "hence , there must be a stable fixed point between these two regions .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a toy model where the particle spectrum in the bulk consists of a bulk graviton , a massless dirac fermion , a massive dirac fermion with mass @xmath150 , and eight massive scalars with equal masses @xmath151 . here",
    "@xmath152 is the mass ratio .",
    "the presence of the massless fermion and the massive scalars is to ensure that the vacuum energy at the minimum has positive value , i.e. @xmath153 .",
    "we summarize the particle content in the bulk in table 1 .",

    "@xcite , can probably create minimum for the vacuum energy .",
    "our particular choice is convenient for investigating the effect of the ther - matter interactions on the casimir energy of the bulk fields .",
    "note that we do not attempt to justify the existence of these bulk fields phenomenologically because we want to demonstrate that stability of the extra dimension could be achieved , if these particles are present in the bulk .",
    "the dirac fermions in five dimensional spacetime have eight physical degrees of freedom . for more realistic models which have chiral fermion on the brane",
    ", we can impose the orbifold reflection symmetry : @xmath155 on the compact direction .",
    "however , this will not affect our main results on stabilization of the extra dimension .",
    "we will ignore this issue for simplicity .",

    "this effect will drive @xmath167 to expand even though there is a minimum today since the radion field @xmath99 has already rolled pass the minimum and can not get back to the stable point .",
    "notice that this effect is the same if matter is confined to the brane .",
    "this can be shown by adding a 4-dimensional term into the 5-dimensional action ( [ action5d ] ) @xmath227 there is no dimension reduction in the matter term but the conformal transformation rescale the matter energy density as @xmath228 .",
    "thus , the total effective potential is the same as in ( [ umatter ] ) .",
    "there is an interesting phenomena if we turn on the ther field . by carefully tuning its norm",
    ", we can show that @xmath167 can be stabilized even if there is non - relativistic matter in the universe .",
    "this can be shown by solving equations of motion ( [ meom1])-([meom3 ] ) numerically .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ aether_stable ] where we choose @xmath221 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 ( or equivalent to @xmath231 ) .",
    "we set the initial conditions such that @xmath232 and ignore the effects of interaction terms by setting @xmath224 . from figure [ f_umatt ] , the minimum of @xmath222 disappear when @xmath233 .",
    "so , in order to make sure that the minimum of @xmath222 does not exist in the initial configuration , we choose the initial time to be at @xmath234 which is approximately the time of matter - radiation equality ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "moreover since the universe also contains radiation component which is not considered in this model , it is reasonable to set @xmath236 .",
    "however , if we ignore the radiation part , we can go back to the much earlier time and show that there are some values of @xmath172 that the extra dimension can be stabilized .",
    "( upper ) and the hubble constant for the non - compact dimensions @xmath237 ( lower ) as the function of time .",
    "the fact that @xmath237 oscillates indicating the period of deceleration and acceleration before it settles down to the constant value and @xmath238 enters a de sitter phase .",
    "right : the scale factor @xmath167 ( upper ) and the hubble constant for the compact extra dimension @xmath239 ( lower ) as the function of time .",
    "@xmath239 oscillates between positive and negative region before settles down to zero .",
    "the extra dimension is stabilized although non - relativistic matter is present.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the role of the ther field can be explained qualitatively in the radion picture .",
    "the ther factor @xmath97 on the right - handed side of equation ( [ reom2 ] ) reduces the influence of the potential gradient @xmath240 . as a consequence",
    ", it will slow down the oscillation frequency of @xmath99 around the minimum of the potential @xmath222 .",
    "if this factor is big enough , @xmath99 will move down the potential at very slow speed .",
    "we can tune @xmath172 such that there is enough time for the universe to create the minimum of @xmath222 before the radion rolls pass it . by this mechanism , stability of the extra dimension can be restored .",
    "let us compare the stabilization time @xmath241 of the moduli field with the age of the universe .",
    "the age of the universe in our model is @xmath242 where we set @xmath243 and @xmath244 . from figure [ aether_stable ] , the stabilization time @xmath245 .",
    "then , @xmath246 is greater than the age of the universe .",
    "in our 5-dimensional model , we have shown that the ther field reduces the influence of the potential gradient and slows down the oscillation frequency of the compact extra dimension .",
    "for vacuum dominated universe , the casimir energy from the extra dimension acts as a stabilizing potential for the moduli field while driving accelerated expansion in the non - compact directions .",
    "the ther field will slow down the oscillation behavior of the moduli or even smooth it out . for the universe which non - relativistic matter is present , this effect is proved to be crucial for stabilization of the extra dimension .",
    "if the vev of ther field is of the order of the 5-dimensional planck mass , @xmath247 , it can slow down the evolution of the moduli field such that there is enough time to create the minimum for the effective potential .    in this paper",
    "we assume homogeneous and isotropic distribution of non - relativistic matter . however , local matter distributions might perturb the radion and knock it over the minimum , causing the ( local ) catastrophic expansion of the fifth dimension . in @xcite , it was also noted that the minimum of the potential well is generally not deep enough to prevent the quantum tunneling of the radion . at this stage , it is not clear whether these two difficulties can be solved by the new mechanism",
    ". these aspects of instability in the presence of the ther are still open questions .",
    "note that the constancy of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant up to very early epoch of the universe will post strong constraint on the size of the extra dimension .",
    "the oscillation behavior of the moduli field may contradict with astronomical observations . in order to construct a more realistic cosmological model of this scenario ,",
    "the extra dimension should reach its stable fixed point before the present time i.e. @xmath248 which require fine tuning of many parameters .",
    "the new possible solution is that we assume very high value of @xmath172 so that the oscillation of @xmath167 has a very long period .",
    "the moduli will evolve smoothly with no oscillating behavior .",
    "we can choose the value of @xmath172 such that the size of the extra dimension changes so slowly and it can not alter the results of the big bang model .    another interesting idea is to imagine that the universe started with a very symmetric state which all spatial dimensions are compactified with the equal radius , for example , topologically an @xmath78-dimensional torus . in general , the casimir energies in this compact universe generate stabilized potential for the radius of all directions . on the other hand , at the very early time , the energy density of matter and radiation will be the dominant contribution .",
    "this will destabilize the moduli fields and all directions will become large . however , if the lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken in some direction i.e. there is a non - vanishing ther field pointing in the fifth direction , it will slow down the dynamics of moduli field associated to the broken direction .",
    "the broken direction will be compactified at stabilized radius while the unbroken directions are allowed to expand .",
    "this cosmological scenario may establish a connection between the dimensionality of spacetime and the violation of lorentz symmetry .",
    "we leave this issue for future investigation .",
