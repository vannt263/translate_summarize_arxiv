    "<S> it is shown that a multilayer comprised of alternating thin superconducting and insulating layers on a thick substrate can fully screen the applied magnetic field exceeding the superheating fields @xmath0 of both the superconducting layers and the substrate , the maximum meissner field is achieved at an optimum multilayer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a dirty layer of thickness @xmath1 m at the nb surface could increase @xmath2 mt of a clean nb up to @xmath3 mt . optimized multilayers of nb@xmath4sn , nbn , some of the iron pnictides , or alloyed nb deposited onto the surface of the nb resonator cavities could potentially double the rf breakdown field , pushing the peak accelerating electric fields above 100 mv / m while protecting the cavity from dendritic thermomagnetic avalanches caused by local penetration of vortices . </S>"
