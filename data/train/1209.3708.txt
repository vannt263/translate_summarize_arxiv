    "about 35 proton - rich nuclei @xcite , the so - called @xmath0 nuclei , can not be synthesized by neutron capture reactions via the @xmath7 and @xmath8 process @xcite .",

    "the long - time favored site , explosive burning in the o / ne shell of massive stars before and during a supernova explosion , was found to underproduce significantly the light @xmath0 nuclei with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "an alternative would be that not just a single process is responsible for all @xmath0 nuclei but that different processes in a number of astrophysical sites produce certain ranges of @xmath0 nuclei ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the search for the @xmath0-nucleus production mechanism a number of processes",

    "a recent study @xcite found that light @xmath0 nuclei are produced in sufficient amounts to explain the abundances in the solar system by a combination of proton capture reactions and photodisintegrations in the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf ( type ia supernova ) , although earlier simulations did not predict such a production @xcite .    in total ,",
    "these processes include several thousands of reactions on thousands of mainly unstable nuclei .",
    "this indicates already that it is not possible to measure all these reaction rates in the laboratory .",
    "therefore , with very few exceptions , the astrophysical reaction rates are calculated by means of the statistical hauser - feshbach model @xcite . nuclear physics input , such as ground state ( g.s . )",
    "properties , level densities , @xmath15-ray strength functions , and optical model potentials are needed for these calculations .",
    "this input can be determined , tested , and improved by laboratory measurements to finally obtain robust and reliable model predictions for these parameters .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that certain reactions are of particular importance in the @xmath2-process reaction network , because a change in their reaction rate has a direct impact on the calculated @xmath0 nuclei abundance .",
    "one of these particular important reactions is the proton capture reaction on @xmath1ge .",
    "it is the first reaction in the sequence @xmath1ge(p,@xmath2)@xmath3as(p , n)@xmath3se(@xmath2,n)@xmath1se , a main production route to the @xmath0 nucleus @xmath1se .",

    "this method makes it possible to investigate besides the total cross section the partial cross section for the direct population of several states in @xmath3as .",
    "this is an advantage compared to the widely used activation technique @xcite , which was not applicable anyway since the reaction product @xmath3as is stable .",
    "the method followed here was already demonstrated by galanopoulos _",
    "_ @xcite of being very powerful to determine very small cross sections , down to @xmath17 for astrophysics applications .",
    "this makes possible an investigation of the @xmath1ge(p,@xmath2 ) reaction between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is very important to measure close to or inside the astrophysically relevant energy range to ensure that dependencies on nuclear properties are similar to those appearing in the stellar rates because these sensitivities strongly vary with energy .",
    "the sensitivities of the astrophysical reaction rate of @xmath1ge(p,@xmath2)@xmath3as to a change in the averaged @xmath2 , neutron , proton , and @xmath21 widths used in the rate and cross - section models are shown in fig .",

    "@xmath22 indicates that the rate is changed by the same factor as the width , while @xmath23 signifies that the width variation has no influence on the predicted rate .",
    "details on the calculation of the sensitivity factor @xmath7 can be found in @xcite .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratesensi ] , the rate prediction is almost exclusively sensitive to the proton width below about @xmath24 , with the relevant stellar plasma temperature @xmath25 for this reaction in the @xmath2 process being close to @xmath26 .",
    "this rate sensitivity is related to the sensitivity of the reaction cross sections for @xmath1ge nuclei being in the g.s . and thermally excited states in the energy range mostly contributing to the reaction rate integral @xmath27 , appearing in the calculation of the stellar rate ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the maxwell - boltzmann energy distribution of the projectiles and @xmath30 is the _ effective _ cross section summing over all energetically possible transitions to states @xmath31 , @xmath14 in the initial and final nucleus , respectively , @xcite    @xmath32    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the above equation implicitly assumes that cross sections @xmath33 at zero or negative energies @xmath34 are zero . in general , the effective cross section includes more transitions than the laboratory cross section @xmath35 .",

    "masses and level schemes for nuclei close to the valley of stability are known with sufficient accuracy .",
    "hence , they are no major source of uncertainty in the calculation of the proton width . therefore , this measurement of the @xmath1ge(p,@xmath2 ) reaction is well suited to test the proton optical potential used in the prediction of the rate and to improve the astrophysical reaction rate at @xmath2-process temperatures .",

    "the beam , which had a diameter of @xmath63 , impinges perpendicular on the target .",
    "the beam current was determined by the charge deposited in the backing with a current integrator with an uncertainty of less than 4 % . a negatively charged diaphragm @xmath64 suppresses secondary electrons at the entrance of the target chamber .",
    "the proton capture reactions were identified by detecting the prompt @xmath2 decays of the reaction products with four high - purity germanium ( hpge detectors ) .",

    "<S> background : :    astrophysical models studying the origin of the neutron - deficient    @xmath0 nuclides require the knowledge of proton capture cross    sections at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> the production site of the @xmath0    nuclei is still under discussion but a firm basis of nuclear reaction    rates is required to address the astrophysical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> data at    astrophysically relevant interaction energies are scarce </S>",
    "<S> . problems    with the prediction of charged particle capture cross sections at low    energy were found in the comparisons between previous data and    calculations in the hauser - feshbach statistical model of compound    reactions . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    a measurement of    @xmath1ge(p,@xmath2)@xmath3as at    low proton energies , inside the astrophysically relevant energy    region , is important in several respects . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction is directly    important as it is a bottleneck in the reaction flow which produces    the lightest @xmath0 nucleus @xmath1se . </S>",
    "<S> it is also    an important addition to the data set required to test reaction - rate    predictions and to allow an improvement in the global p+nucleus    optical potential required in such calculations . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    an in - beam experiment was performed , making it possible to measure in    the range @xmath4 , which is    for the most part inside the astrophysically relevant energy window .    </S>",
    "<S> angular distributions of the @xmath2-ray transitions were    measured with high - purity germanium detectors at eight angles relative    to the beam axis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the total cross sections , partial    cross sections for the direct population of twelve levels were    determined . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the resulting cross sections were compared to hauser - feshbach    calculations using the code smaragd . </S>",
    "<S> only a constant renormalization    factor of the calculated proton widths allowed a good reproduction of    both total and partial cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the calculation    made it possible to check the spin assignment of some states in    @xmath3as . in the case of the 1075 kev state , a double    state with spins and parities of 3/2@xmath5 and    5/2@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is needed to explain the experimental partial    cross sections . a change in parity from 5/2@xmath6 to    5/2@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is required for the state at 401 kev . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore ,    in the case of @xmath1ge , studying the combination of    total and partial cross sections made it possible to test the    @xmath2 width , which is essential in the calculation of    the astrophysical    @xmath1as(n,@xmath2)@xmath3as    rate . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    between data and statistical model prediction a factor of about two    was found . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the improved astrophysical reaction rate of    @xmath1ge(p,@xmath2 ) ( and its reverse    reaction ) is only 28% larger than the previous standard rate . </S>",
    "<S> the    prediction of the    @xmath1as(n,@xmath2)@xmath3as    rate ( and its reverse ) was confirmed , the newly calculated rate    differs only by a few percent from the previous prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the    in - beam method with high efficiency detectors proved to be a powerful    tool for studies in nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure . </S>"
