    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors has  generated a great deal of interests because of rather high transition temperature @xmath3 and high upper critical fields @xmath4 .",
    "crystal structures of iron - based superconductors can be mainly categorized into several types : fepn-1111 type ( reofepn , re = rare earth ; pn = p or as ) , fepn-122 type ( afe@xmath5as@xmath5 , a = alkaline or alkaline - earth metals ) , fepn111 type ( afeas ) , fech-11 type ( fech , ch = s , se , te ) , fech-122 type ( a@xmath6fe@xmath7ch@xmath5 ) , and other structures with more complex oxide layers.@xcite@xmath8@xcite despite structural similarity , i.e. , shared fepn or fech tetrahedron layers , iron - based superconductors exhibit diverse physical properties .",

    "an extremely complex binary alloy phase diagram and associated difficulties in single crystal preparation impeded the growth of pure @xmath1-fese single crystals.@xcite hence , systematic studies of anisotropy in @xmath0 and pair breaking mechanism in high magnetic field are still lacking .    in this work , we report on the upper critical fields of pure @xmath1-fese single crystals in dc high magnetic fields up to 35 t at ambient and high pressures .",

    "the rf technique is very sensitive to small changes in the rf penetration depth ( about 1 - 5 nm ) in the mixed state and thus is an accurate method for determining the @xmath4 of superconductors.@xcite at certain magnetic field , the probe detects the transition to the normal state by tracking the shift in resonant frequency , which is proportional to the change in penetration depth as @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
