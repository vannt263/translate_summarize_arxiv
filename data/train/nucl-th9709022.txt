    "a dedicated scattering experiment at the frascati @xmath5factory da@xmath6ne is expected to bring the statistics on each of the @xmath2initiated processes from the few hundred events of the tst collaboration at nimrod to the 10@xmath7 ",
    "10@xmath8 events / year expected for a _ dedicated _ @xmath2 experiment at da@xmath6ne . to analyse these data with adequate accuracy , one has to go beyond the coupled  channel analyses performed in the past .    with da@xmath6ne under construction , and still now that the date of its commissioning is nearing , a team of theorists grouped in an e.e.c .",
    "network under the name of euroda@xmath6ne to study both widely and deeply the impact and the exploitation of the data soon to come out of frascati : the outputs of their work are to be summarized in successive editions of the `` da@xmath6ne physics handbook '' @xcite , now to its second version . of this group",
    "the present authors are proud to be a small branch .",
    "when da@xmath6ne will be working at the @xmath5resonance peak , it will be an intense source of almost monochromatic kaons , @xmath9 of momentum 126 mev / c and @xmath10 of momentum 110 mev / c ( at the interaction point ) . depending on the nature of the beam  pipe window and on the use of suitably thin moderators , the @xmath9 momenta can be made to span a momentum range from around 115 mev / c down to about 80 mev / c , covering the @xmath11 charge ",
    "exchange threshold region .",
    "rates at the source are expected ( for a reference luminosity of @xmath12 @xmath13s@xmath14 ) to be around 1,200 @xmath9/s and 830 @xmath10/s : the decay length of the @xmath9 s being about 90 cm , the volume ( and cost ) of a _ dedicated _ detector , measuring interactions in gaseous h@xmath15 ( and d@xmath15 and @xmath16he/@xmath17he as well ) , and exploiting kloe s detection techniques , need not be larger that 1/10 of kloe , but , of course , it will have to be as transparent to low  momentum particles and as efficient in detecting neutrals as kloe .",
    "measurements on @xmath17he will allow access to the kinematical region below the @xmath2 threshold , dominated by the two resonant states @xmath18(1405 ) and @xmath19(1385 ) @xcite .",
    "one can thus hope to measure not only differential cross sections for all charged and neutral two  body final states , but also channel cross sections for all three - body ones and , even more important for the knowledge of the low ",
    "energy p  waves ( whose relevance to the s =  1 channels phenomenology is treated in the other paper presented by our group at this symposium @xcite ) , one can exploit the self  analysing nature of @xmath18 and @xmath20 hyperons to measure their final polarizations @xcite .    as of today , the only available pieces of information on the p  waves below 250 mev / c are 4 data points on the 1st moment of the angular distribution for each of the channels @xmath21 , published by the tst collaboration @xcite ( and not used by any analysis ) , all consistent with zero within 2 @xmath22 .",
    "an analysis of the new data will of course have to re  analyse all existing , lower  quality data as well : for a significant analysis below 550 mev / c ( the region covered by j.k .",

    "martin used once  subtracted forward dispersion relations for the amplitudes @xmath25 ( in terms of the invariant  amplitude decomposition of the pseudoscalar ",
    "matrix @xmath26 ) for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 elastic scattering ; his constraints depended of course on additional parameters , namely the subtraction constants @xmath29 and the @xmath30 couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "one would like to extend this type of constraints to other amplitudes and channels , as e.g. the @xmath33 amplitudes @xcite , dominated by p ",
    "waves rather than by s  waves as @xmath34 s are , or those `` unphysical '' channels such as @xmath35 or @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .    a first difficulty is encountered in this kind of approach , since the k ",

    ". cut unphysical regions for reactions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , when the @xmath40channel born  term singularities `` invade '' the low  energy @xmath3 cut .",
    "the trouble is only marginal , since in the _ full amplitudes _ the singularities reduce to poles present only in the real parts , and the imaginary parts generated by k ",
    "matrices _ automatically _ satisfy unitarity : the answer to this problem , rather that to modify the k ",
    "matrices , is to make use _ only _ of the imaginary parts produced by this formalism in the dispersive treatment of these channels .    conventional forms of dispersion relations @xcite , even in their simplest , unsubtracted version @xcite , present several shortcomings , all of them tied either to their rate of convergence , which could be improved by subtractions ( but at the cost of additional , _ external _ parametres ) , or to the born  terms , which introduce the coupling constants , which one would like to _ extract _ from the analysis , as further _",
    "external _ parametres of the latter .    a way to perform a parametre  free test of analyticity _ alone _ on such analyses would be to make direct use of cauchy s theorem for the amplitude @xmath41 , analytic inside a contour @xmath42 : @xmath43    thus , since our @xmath44 s have the born  term poles , we have to write instead @xmath45 where @xmath46 is analytic by construction inside @xmath42 , and has zeros at all poles of @xmath41 . unfortunately , as long as one keeps @xmath47 , there is no _ elementary _ way of doing it and still be able to work without divergent integrations .",
    "a way out was indicated by several authors @xcite , and it consists in mapping the variable @xmath48 into a new one @xmath49 so that the physical sheet is mapped into the unit disk and the first ( or second ) unphysical one into the rest of the plane : one can now have a family of @xmath50 s with a very simple form , such as @xmath51 , valid for any crossing  even amplitude @xmath52 behaving as @xmath53 with @xmath54 for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and the @xmath57 represent the positions of the poles inside the unit disk .",
    "the mapping @xmath49 is given as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the threshold of the unphysical sheet mapped outside the unit disk and @xmath60 is the point in the @xmath48plane mapped into the centre of the same .",
    "defining @xmath61 one would have all @xmath62 for an @xmath44 meromorphic inside @xmath42 , and building the sum @xmath63 = \\sum_{n=0}^n\\vert\\frac{1}{2\\pi i } \\int_{\\gamma_1 }",

    "( 3 ) reduces @xmath65 to a small arclet around @xmath66 ) ; by this @xmath0 functional one can introduce in the fitting procedure a measure of the _ lack of analyticity _ of the parametrization employed .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath59 chosen for @xmath39 at the @xmath4 threshold , only the imaginary parts of the amplitudes on the @xmath3 low  energy cut will enter the integrations .",
    "further improvements to the above technique can be offered by the weighing technique , which consists in introducing as a factor in the dispersive integrals a function @xmath67 , analytic inside @xmath42 , which further suppresses the effects of the neglected region @xmath68 , while at the same time weighing the inputs according to their statistical ( or systematic ) accuracies @xcite .",
    "let @xmath44 be the correct amplitude , @xmath69 our parametrization for it or ( when @xmath44 is directly measurable ) its experimental values , and let us assume @xmath70 on @xmath64 and @xmath71 on @xmath68 : using the schwarz ",
    "villat formula @xcite @xmath72 one can construct a weight function @xmath67 satisfying @xmath73 on @xmath64 and @xmath74 on @xmath68 , and thus define a `` weighted '' theoretical @xmath0functional as @xmath75 = \\sum_{n=0}^n\\vert\\frac{1}{2\\pi i } \\int_{\\gamma_1 } f(z )   g_n(z ) w(z ) dz \\vert^2 . \\label{7}\\ ] ]    such a test can then be run    \\i ) for all invariant amplitudes @xmath76 ,",

    "it has since long been the learned opinion of the present authors that this is quite far from the truth @xcite ; but we can now show that improvements are at hand , and some of them could already be implemented in a rather easy way , although with scarce expectation for success , in absence of new and better data .",
