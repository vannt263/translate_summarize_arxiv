    "recently  @xcite we reported observation of long time relaxation of ( negative ) magnetoresistance in p - type algaas - gaas quantum well structures where both wells and barriers were doped by be . we argued that in these structures so - called @xmath0 centers  doubly occupied acceptors belonging to the upper hubbard band  are formed in the well .",
    "the observed long time behavior of magnetoresistance was explained by polaron effects involving the spin - correlated @xmath0-centers  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report more detailed studies of slow relaxations in the same samples .",
    "the main point requiring more detailed measurements is that in our previous paper  @xcite fluctuations of the sample temperature during measurements were out of proper control and account .",
    "since temperature fluctuations may lead to a variation of the sample resistance our previous results and their interpretation need a proper verification .",
    "we are grateful to z.  ovadyahy who attracted our attention to this problem .",
    "investigation of role of the temperature fluctuations is the main goal of the present work .",
    "we will show that , although the temperature fluctuations indeed can produce a pronounced effect on the resistance , the observed long time relaxations of magnetoresistance have an independent source similar to that mechanism considered in  @xcite . more careful analysis of the experimental results has required , however , some modification of the theoretical model  @xcite .",
    "namely , now we believe that two mechanisms can lead to a slow relaxation of the magnetoresistance .",
    "the fist one is the magnetic - field - induced shift of the chemical potential of the holes  @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is due to a direct influence of the magnetic field on the _ aggregates _",
    "responsible for formation of the polaron gap at the sites responsible for the conductance  @xcite .",
    "contrary to  @xcite , we conclude that it is the second mechanism that explains the refined experimental results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ samples ] we briefly describe the samples and experimental procedure and report the experimental results .",
    "these results are interpreted in sec .  [ discussion ] where the theoretical models are considered and compared with experiment .",
    "we used the structures containing 10 gaas quantum wells separated by al@xmath1ga@xmath2as barriers .",
    "thickness of both wells and barriers was 15 nm .",
    "confining al@xmath1ga@xmath2as layers had thickness of 20 nm .",
    "the growth procedure is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "central regions with thickness of 5 nm of both wells and barriers were @xmath3-doped with be ( concentration @xmath4 atoms/@xmath5 ) .",
    "the contacts were made by 2 min burning at 450@xmath6 c in deposited gold containing 3% of zn .",
    "the samples were shaped as hall bars .",
    "the resistance was determined from the voltage between the voltage probes at a fixed current of 1 na .",
    "we studied several samples cut from the same wafer .",
    "the samples were relatively low - ohmic ( @xmath7  ohms/@xmath8 at 4  k ) that is , in our opinion , due to the fact that the impurity band formed by @xmath0 centers is rather close to the valence band , the binding energy being @xmath9 mev  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that for all our measurements the @xmath10 curves were linear in the temperature domain 4.2 - 1.35 k. the temperature dependence of the resistance is compatible with the 2d mott variable range hopping ( see fig .  1 in  @xcite ) , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 k for the sample under investigation .",
    "the magnetoresistance curves were close to those reported in  @xcite , namely , the linear negative magnetoresistance crossed over to the quadratic positive magnetoresistance at stronger magnetic fields .",
    "studies of the slow relaxations induced by controlled variation of external magnetic field are specifically difficult because our thermometers are sensitive to magnetic field . therefore , to investigate role of the temperature fluctuations we made special measurements of the sample resistance and its temperature in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to evolution of temperature while the solid curve - to evolution of voltage .",
    "the curves were drawn by the adjacent averaging of the experimental points ( involving 10 points ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] , width=302 ]    the corresponding curves are presented in  fig .  1 .",
    "one concludes that temperature fluctuations up to several mk indeed exist .",
    "we believe that these fluctuations are due to fluctuations of the pressure in the system pumped by a pre - evacuation pump without a sufficiently large damping volume , which should be at least by an order of magnitude larger than the dewar volume .",
    "it is also seen that the resistance fluctuates keeping time with the temperature fluctuations  there is no lag between variations of the resistance and temperature .",
    "this fact allows us to conclude that at a given time the resistance of the sample is controlled by the temperature of the sample measured at the same instant of time .",
    "accordingly , we can extract temperature derivative of the resistance and then estimate the corresponding fluctuation - induced contribution to the zero - field resistance at a known temperature as @xmath13 from fig .",
    "1 it is seen that the variation of temperature by 1  mk leads to a variation of voltage and thus the variation of resistance is of the order of 0.2% .    shown in fig .",
    "2 is time dependence of magnetoresistance ( or rather of the voltage between the probe contacts ) obtained by ramping of magnetic field in time with very slow sweep rate ( about 30 oe / s ) .",
    "large circles show measured temperatures at @xmath14 , that correspond to 3 instants of time in fig .",
    "note that the magnetoresistance curves of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were close to those reported in fig .  1 of our previous paper ,  @xcite which were obtained at fast magnetic field sweep of @xmath15 oe / s @xcite .",
    "namely , the linear negative magnetoresistance crossed over to the quadratic positive magnetoresistance at stronger magnetic fields .    .",
    "dashed lines connect the values of voltage and temperature at the times when @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig2 ] , width=302 ]    as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the resistance at the successive instants of time when @xmath16 is different  it gradually decreases with time ( by @xmath17% ) . at the same time , the temperature at that instants is almost the same showing initially weak decrease and then a weak increase within the interval not exceeding @xmath18  mk .",
    "these deviations of temperature would lead only to deviations of the resistance by @xmath19 ( upward and downward ) .",
    "these measurements demonstrate that , in addition to thermal effects , the resistance tends to decrease after application of the magnetic field , the effect at the times @xmath20  s being at the level of 1% .    in fig .  3",
    ", we present the behavior of the voltage across the probe contacts ( and thus of the resistance ) for two opposite current directions for the sample quenched during 20 min in a steady magnetic field of 0.7 t after subsequent switching off the field .        in this case",
    "the temperature measurements are available during all the time of the measurement .",
    "thus we are able to correct the resistance curve for the temperature fluctuations at all experimental points .",
    "it is seen that the corrected voltage , @xmath21 , slowly relaxes to higher values and is saturated at times @xmath22  s. it is important that the saturation value is equal to the resistance of the sample before application of the magnetic field .",
    "in other words , after application of the magnetic field the resistance slowly decreases with time but after switching off of the field it is gradually restored to its initial value .",
    "it is also important that the restoration time is nearly equal to the time at which the sample was subjected to the external magnetic field .",
    "we believe that the results presented above evidence a specific slow response of the sample resistance to applied magnetic field . this response can not be explained by temperature fluctuations , which would not lead to the observed contribution to the resistance , which monotonously depends on time . as it follows both from experiment and our estimates , a steady heating due to eddy currents induced in the cu substrate by variations in the magnetic field is negligibly small . at the same time",
    ", the observed resistance gradually decreases after application of magnetic field and tends to restore after switching it off .",
    "in addition , as it follows from direct measurements and our estimates , a possible effect of temperature fluctuations would be about an order of magnitude less than the observed variation of resistance .

    "we assume that some localized states ( including @xmath0-centers  acceptor atoms doubly occupied by holes and located in the wells ) form bistable aggregates .",
    "the low energy states of these aggregates are almost degenerate , the transitions between the states can take place only due to _ many - electron _ processes that results in very long transition times .",
    "though the above aggregates do not belong to the percolation cluster , they can be polarized by the electrical charges located at the hopping sites .",
    "the _ polaron clouds _ formed by the aggregates for typical hopping sites lead to formation of a _ polaron gap _ at the fermi level . as a result , conductance decreases .",
    "an important feature of the material under consideration is that , in addition to doubly and singly occupied acceptors in the well ( @xmath0 centers and @xmath23 centers , respectively ) , there can also exist _ neutral _ complexes consisting of negatively charged acceptor in the barrier and a valence - band hole located in the well , which is coupled to the acceptor due to coulomb interaction .",
    "we will call such complexes the @xmath24 centers .",
    "analog of such complexes in a @xmath25-type conductor were introduced in  @xcite , and in what follows we will exploit the scheme suggested in that paper . in the material under consideration , one has to consider acceptor complexes of 4 types : ( i ) positively charged @xmath0-centers  doubly occupied ( by holes ) acceptors located in the wells and forming the upper hubbard band ; ( ii ) neutral @xmath23-centers  singly occupied ( by holes ) acceptors located in the wells ; ( iii ) negative @xmath26-centers  acceptors in the barriers ; and ( iv ) neutral @xmath24-complexes consisting of an acceptor in the barrier coupled to a valence - band hole in the well .    assuming that he dopant concentrations , @xmath27 , within the barrier and within the well are equal one has @xmath28 due to charge conservation we also have @xmath29 in combination with eq .",

    "let us take into account the fact that a hole provided by an acceptor within the barrier is inevitably captured within the well .",
    "however , it can belong either to an @xmath0 or it can exist as a valence band hole coupled to a negative acceptor in the barrier forming an @xmath24 center . in particular , a hole released by an acceptor in the barrier can be captured by an occupied acceptor in the well forming @xmath0 center provided @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the binding energy of the center of @xmath35th type , @xmath36 is a distance between the two acceptors along the plane of the structure , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the thicknesses of the well and the barrier , respectively .",

    "in contrast , if @xmath42 both @xmath0-centers and @xmath43-centers can not be formed , and only @xmath23- and @xmath44-centers are present . strictly speaking ,",
    "in both of these limits the charge transport over the impurity band can not take place .",
    "such a transport requires partial  compensation \" of the acceptors , which is possible provided @xmath45 in this case the relation between the concentrations of the @xmath0- and @xmath24-centers ( and thus of the @xmath23-centers ) depends on the dopant concentration , @xmath27 , which controls the typical value of @xmath36 in eq .",

    "the transition between the two states can be due to either a coherent multi - electron hop , or due to motion of a  domain wall \" separating parts of the aggregate with different phases of spin orientation . for this model ,",
    "the size of the optimal aggregate turns out to be relatively large and its coupling to hopping sites is most effective when the hopping site is close to one of the sites belonging to the aggregate . in this case",
    "the coupling is just due to coulomb interaction between the charges of the hopping site and the nearest site of the aggregate .",
    "the coupling to the rest sites of the aggregate turns out to be much weaker . in this case",

    "the apparent divergence at @xmath80 has a cut - off due to the fact that the small values of interaction energy @xmath62 correspond to large distances between the hopping site and the aggregate . at large distance",
    "the coulomb charge - charge coupling is replaced by a much weaker dipole coupling originating from a ( random ) dipole moment of the aggregate .",
    "having this fact in mind we assume that the cut - off as the energy @xmath81 corresponding to the typical coupling energy between the sites separated by the typical hopping length @xmath82 .",
    "the quantity @xmath81 is just the width of the hopping energy band . following this reasoning",
    "we assume that the gaps with @xmath83 do not effectively influence the hopping transport . as a result",
    ", the density of states near the fermi level as a function of energy can be described by an interpolation relation as @xmath84 in the framework of the model  @xcite the time scales @xmath85 are controlled by the gate voltage protocol while in the present case case , the external perturbation is due to variation of the magnetic field .",
    "an instant application of magnetic field leads to a shift of the chemical potential within the polaron gap .",
    "let us estimate the corresponding change in conductance assuming that @xmath86 from eqs .",
    "( [ gap ] ) and ( [ mu1 ] ) one can expect that energy shift of @xmath87 .",
    "therefore one can expect that the magnetoresistance in an oscillating magnetic field would form a pattern following the magnetic field .",
    "in addition to such a pattern , the experiments demonstrate a gradual increase of the conductance with time .    to explain this increase we introduce an additional mechanism , which is due to a slow reconstruction of the polaron gap adjusting its _ depth _ to the magnetic - field - dependent number of the  active \" sites forming the polaron cloud .",
    "the reconstruction can result from a _ direct _ influence of the magnetic field on the aggregates forming the polaron clouds .",
    "indeed , the aggregates are formed from pairs of sites allowing electron ( hole ) transitions within the pairs .",
    "these transitions change _ types _ of the impurity complexes as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "thus one concludes that the probability for the first configuration to be included into the aggregate is given by the product @xmath91 while for the second two configurations - by the product @xmath92 . in the region specified by eq .",

    "the variation of this product , in its turn , is @xmath101 therefore one concludes that the effect of magnetic field depends on the sign of @xmath102 .",
    "if this sign is positive , that is the concentration of @xmath0 centers is relatively small , the concentration of the aggregates decreases with an application of magnetic field ( decreasing @xmath93 ) . in its turn",
    ", it leads to a suppression of the polaron effect and to a decrease of the resistance .",
    "if the concentration of @xmath0-centers is large , the magnetic field can lead to an increase of the resistance . since the experiment demonstrates a decrease of resistance as a result of the application of the magnetic field ,",
    "we conclude that in our case the density of @xmath23-centers exceeds the density of @xmath0-centers .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that in our experiments the typical distances between acceptors , @xmath103 , were relatively large , at least @xmath104 which is in favor of creating @xmath24 centers rather than @xmath0centers .",
    "the relative decrease of the density of states of the aggregates , @xmath105 can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ deltan+ ] ) as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the time average of the absolute value of the magnetic field .",
    "this ratio is equal to the relative ( with respect to the total number of sites experiencing the polaron effect ) number of the hopping sites where the polaron cloud is destroyed by the magnetic field .",
    "it is important that this effect is linear in @xmath108 and can dominate over the quadratic effect mentioned above .    for further estimates we have to specify the tls distribution function .",
    "a crude estimate for @xmath76 in the case of electronic aggregates is  @xcite @xmath109 here @xmath77 is the number of pairs of sites forming the aggregate , the exponential is a statistical factor describing the probability to construct the bistable aggregate , @xmath110 is the typical distance between the sites forming the aggregate . here",
    "the first factor in the denominator describes the typical volume of the ( 2d ) aggregate while the second - typical scatter of the tls energy splitting .",
    "the factor @xmath111 depends on the competition between the coulomb interactions within the system and scatter of single - particle energies .",
    "indeed , for weak coulomb interactions the system is in its ground state and occupation of all single - particle states is given .",
    "it is the coulomb correlations that allow to have metastable configurations with close total energies .",
    "unfortunately , the number @xmath111 is not known ; it can depend on realization of the coulomb glass .",
    "however one expects that large relaxation times are available at not too large @xmath77 and thus the exponential is not too small .",
    "assuming @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 nm ( that is of the order of the typical hopping length ) one estimates @xmath76 as @xmath115 @xmath116erg@xmath117 . substituting this estimate in eqs .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , ( [ ef ] ) and assuming that , @xmath118 one obtains @xmath119 here @xmath120 is the observation time while @xmath121 is given by the inverse sweep rate .",
    "this estimate by order of magnitude agrees with the experimental data .",
    "note that the present estimate differs from that of  @xcite where the effect of magnetic field was attributed to partial suppression of the polaron gap by the magnetic field to an increase of the energy of the upper state of an aggregate .",
    "the suppression is due to influence of the magnetic field on the @xmath0-centers making some configuration inaccessible even with account of the correlation energy .",
    "however , we underestimated a possible effect of an increase of the energy of the lower state involving @xmath0 centers , which can compensate the effect related to the increase of the energy of the upper level . in this way",
    ", we overestimated the slow - relaxing part of the conductance . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental result for this quantity was also overestimated because it was not corrected for the temperature fluctuations .",
    "we believe that the corrected experimental results and the suggested theoretical model are consistent .",
    "namely , the model explains experimentally observed gradual increase of conductance with time .",
    "thus we have discussed two different mechanisms of slow relaxations ( of magnetoresistance ) in response to time - dependent external magnetic field , both related to the polaron effect .",
    "the first one is to some extent similar to the effect of the gate voltage  @xcite .",
    "it is induced by magnetic - field - driven shift of the chemical potential . as it was noted above",
    ", this mechanism does not explain the observed gradual increase of conductance in time .",
    "we expect that this mechanism will be more pronounced and even dominant in the situation when the induced shift is larger than the width of the hopping energy band .",
    "the second effect is related to a _",
    "direct _ dependence of the  active \" sites responsible for the polaron effect on the magnetic field . according to our estimates ,",
    "it is this effect that is responsible for the experimentally observed slow relaxing response .",
    "it worth noting that the slow relaxations in response to variations of the gate voltage are usually not observed in doped crystalline semiconductors  the experiments  @xcite were performed using samples with significant amount of disorder .",
    "we believe that there two reasons for that : ( i ) the tls - induced polaron effects are much weaker that a direct influence of the gate voltage on the dos ; ( ii ) relatively large sweep rates of the gate voltage probably lead to pronounced non - equilibrium behaviors . in the present experiments ,",
    "the direct influence of the magnetic field sweep is much weaker , and therefore the effects induced by tls polarons can be observed .",
    "to conclude , we observed a slow relaxation of magnetoresistance in response to applied magnetic field in selectively doped p - gaas - algaas structures with partially filled upper hubbard band .",
    "we explain this behavior as related to the properties of the coulomb glass formed by charged centers with account of spin correlations , which are sensitive to external magnetic field .",
