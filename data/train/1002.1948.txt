    "iron - based superconductors are currently at the focus of condensed - matter research . discovered less than two years ago @xcite ,",
    "these novel materials have attracted attention not only because of their high critical temperatures , but also because of their similarities with cuprates .",
    "their phase diagram resembles that of the cuprates , most notably , the superconducting state seems to develop from an unconventional normal state , after magnetic order is destroyed by doping .",
    "they are also layered materials , consisting of feas , fete , fes or fese planes , separated by spacer layers . however , there are also some important differences .",
    "most notably , the parent compounds of cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators , whereas the parent compounds of iron - based superconductors are antiferromagnetic spin density wave ( sdw ) metals @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy is a powerful probe of electrodynamic response of high - t@xmath3 superconductors @xcite .",
    "optical constants provide insight into low - energy excitations and charge dynamics , critical for understanding physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "the information obtained from optical constants can be used to test existing theories and/or stimulate development of new theoretical models .",
    "optical spectroscopy is also a crucial experimental method for electronic band structure determination .",
    "several families of iron - based superconductors have been discovered and they are conveniently refereed to as the `` 11 '' , `` 1111 '' or `` 122 '' families @xcite .",
    "the 11 family is peculiar because the spacer layers are absent , and it is believed that this family will allow the intrinsic properties of iron - containing planes to be isolated . however , most of optical studies so far have focused on the 122 family @xcite ( and to a lesser extent 1111 family @xcite ) for which large single crystals can be grown . in this work , we have investigated the electrodynamic response of a member of the 11 ( fete ) family . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first optical study of a superconducting member of this family",
    ". the only previous ir study on 11 family was on a non - superconducting fe@xmath5te ( ref .  ) .",
    "structural analysis has shown that the exact chemical composition of the analyzed sample is fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 ( ref .  ) .",
    "note that in addition to being doped with s , this sample also has 6  @xmath6 of excess iron , which might play important role in charge dynamics @xcite .",
    "magnetization measurements have revealed that the studied system undergoes structural and magnetic transitions , with transition temperature around 23 k ( ref .  ) .",
    "transport measurements on the other hand do not display any signatures of these transitions , and dc resistivity monotonically increases as temperature decreases down to 8 k , when the system undergoes superconducting transition and the resistivity abruptly drops to zero .",
    "infrared ( ir ) reflectance measurements were performed at the university of akron on a bruker ifs 66v / s , whereas uv - visible experiments were conducted using varian / cary 300 .",
    "an overfilling technique was used to obtain the absolute values of reflectance from the sample with surface area of approximately 1  mm @xmath7 1  mm ( ref .  ) .",
    "electrodynamic response was probed in the frequency range 50 - 50 000  @xmath4 ( 6 mev - 6.2 ev ) and as a function of temperature in the range 10  k - 300  k , all in the normal state .",
    "the optical constants were extracted from reflectance data using kramers - kronig ( kk ) analysis .",
    "in addition , we have performed magneto - optical measurements at 4.2 k ( in the superconducting state ) with magnetic fields up to 18 tesla .",
    "figure [ fig : ref ] displays raw reflectance data r(@xmath8 ) and the real part of optical conductivity @xmath9 .",
    "the absolute value of reflectance gradually decreases with frequency from about 0.9 at 50  @xmath4 to about 0.25 at 50000  @xmath4 , which can be interpreted as metallic behavior .",
    "however the temperature dependence is opposite from expected @xcite , as the reflectivity decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "this anomalous behavior is even more obvious in @xmath9 : zero - energy ( drude - like ) peak is absent from the data ( except maybe at 300 k ) and the conductivity decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature at the lowest measured frequencies .",
    "this result indicates that at low temperatures quasiparticles are not well defined , which will become even more obvious from the extended drude analysis below .",
    "fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 therefore can be considered to be an `` incoherent metal '' @xcite .",
    "although the overall behavior of reflectance is metallic , the plasma edge can not be clearly resolved in the spectra , as reflectance gradually decreases with frequency . at higher frequencies the response is dominated by interband transitions , but they also are not easily discerned in the spectra . a shoulder in optical conductivity around 14000  @xmath4 ( 1.7 ev ) may originate from transitions involving iron _",
    "3d _ states , similar to what was predicted by haule et al . in a theoretical study of another iron - based superconductor @xcite .",
    "we also do not observe any phonon peaks in the far - ir , similar to fe@xmath5te ( ref .  ) .",
    "structural and magnetic transitions at 23  k do not seem to have any significant effect on optical spectra .",
    "theoretical calculations of fese , based on lda+dmft , predicted `` incoherent metal '' with a pseudogap at low frequencies @xcite , in accord with our results .",
    "these calculations also predict a smooth crossover of optical conductivity to a power law behavior @xmath10 at higher frequencies @xcite .",

    "the lowest lying oscillator displays most prominent temperature dependence .",
    "its energy and intensity grow significantly as temperature decreases .",
    "the mid - ir peak at 3000  @xmath4 ( 372  mev ) might be a generic feature of iron - based superconductors ; similar peaks have been observed in other families @xcite .",
    "the oscillator at 14800  @xmath4 simulates the effect of interband transitions , presumably involving iron _",
    "3d _ states , as discussed above .    in the one - component approach",
    "one assumes that only a single type of carriers are present in the system , but their scattering rate acquires frequency dependence @xcite . within",
    "the so - called `` extended '' drude model one calculates the optical scattering rate @xmath12 and effective mass @xmath13 from the complex optical conductivity @xmath14 as :    @xmath15 \\label{eq : tau}%\\ ] ]    @xmath16 \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\label{eq : mass}%\\ ] ]    where the plasma frequency @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the carrier density and @xmath19 their band mass ) can be estimated from the integration of @xmath20 up to the frequency of the onset of interband absorption .",
    "however , as pointed out above , the plasma edge is not very prominent in the spectra of fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 , rendering the value of plasma frequency ambiguous .",
    "instead , we fit the value of @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mass ] so that the effective mass at frequencies around 3500  @xmath4 is equal to unity ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau](b ) ) .",
    "the best fit is achieved for @xmath21= 26,000  @xmath4 ( 3.2 ev ) and the results of the analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] .",
    "the features of an `` incoherent metal '' are now obvious .",
    "the scattering rate is relatively flat and featureless at room temperature , but at low temperatures it develops a peak below 180  @xmath4 .",
    "the effective mass , on the other hand , becomes negative .",
    "these feature of the spectra are indications that the quasiparticle concept , on which the extended drude model is based , is not applicable at low temperatures .     and effective mass @xmath13 obtained from eqs .",
    "[ eq : tau ] and [ eq : mass ] .",
    "both optical functions reveal the failure of the quasipaticle concept at low temperatures.,width=359 ]    [ fig : tau ]",
    "model - independent sum rules are important tools in condensed - matter physics @xcite .",
    "the so - called effective spectral weight function n(@xmath8 ) is frequently used for the analysis of ir spectra .",
    "it is defined as @xcite :    @xmath22    and for @xmath23 it becomes the global oscillator strength sum rule :    @xmath24    which is a statement on the conservation of electric charge @xcite .",
    "eq .  [ eq : n ] is often used to quantify spectral weight redistribution between temperatures t@xmath25 and t@xmath26 in the form :    @xmath27    fig .",
    "[ fig : gsw ] shows the results of this analysis applied to fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 at t@xmath25= 77  k and t@xmath26= 10  k. @xmath28 has a characteristic shape , which indicates that the spectral weight is removed from the low frequency region , below 1000  @xmath4 and is transferred to higher frequencies , in the region around 2000 - 4000  @xmath4 . within the error bars ,",
    "the spectral weigh is recovered by the mid - ir region .",
    "however , @xmath29 spectrum can not reveal the energy scale at which the transfer of spectral weight occurs .    in order to address this question",
    "we introduce `` generalized spectral weight '' function @xmath30 :    @xmath31    the idea comes from the correlation functions frequently used in signal processing @xcite .",
    "more recently ( auto)correlation function was used for the analysis of arpes spectra , where it is directly related to the quasiparticle density of states @xcite . note that @xmath30 is a function of the frequency shift @xmath32 , not the upper integration limit @xmath8 .",
    "function @xmath30 is expected to display characteristic features at the values of energy shifts @xmath33 that connect regions between which a large amount of spectral weight is transferred . in practical applications ,",
    "function @xmath30 is usually dominated by the spectral weight which does not participate in redistribution , and these characteristic features might not be obvious . in those cases",
    "the first derivative of @xmath30 is useful .",
    "examples of these calculations will be presented in a separate publication @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsw ] we show the results of generalized spectral weight analysis ( eq .  [ eq : aleph ] ) applied to fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 at t@xmath25 = 77  k and t@xmath26 = 10  k. the @xmath30 is dominated by the spectral weight that does not participate in transfer , so instead we display the first derivative @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath34 spectrum reveals a broad peak centered around 2250  @xmath4 ( 280  mev ) .",

    "in a density functional study of fes , fese and fete it was reported that the fermi surface and electronic structure of these compounds is similar to those of iron pnictides ( 1111 and 122 families ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 11 family was suppose to be a model system in which to study the intrinsic properties of iron - containing planes .",
    "however , our results , combined with previous ir studies , indicate that there might be some important differences between the electronic structure of 11 and the other families .",
    "the reflectance of fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 is similar to the reflectance of fe@xmath5te ( ref .  ) . in the far - ir region",
    "the reflectance of fe@xmath5te decreases with decreasing temperature , resulting in a reduction of conductivity in far - ir region , similar to what we observe in fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "chen et al .",
    "speculate that this incoherent transport in fe@xmath5te is caused by strong scattering from excess iron @xcite . however , there are also some important differences between fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 and fe@xmath5te .",
    "we observe no rapid increase in conductivity at low frequencies for 10 k measurements . on the other hand in fe@xmath5te a narrow drude - like peak develops in the optical conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "this coherent behavior appears below structural and magnetic phase transition at 65  k , which implies that it is related to sdw order . in fe@xmath5te",
    "this phase transition has stronger influence on charge transport than in fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 : the dc resistivity changes character from insulating to metallic below the transition .",
    "incoherent charge transport in the 11 family should be contrasted with a coherent response which has been observed in 1111 @xcite and 122 families @xcite .",
    "infrared spectra of both undoped ( parent ) and doped phases of these families display well defined drude - like modes .",
    "similar to fe@xmath5te sdw transition has a dramatic effects on their optical properties .",
    "the response of parent compounds bafe@xmath26as@xmath26 and srfe@xmath26as@xmath26 becomes even more coherent below the sdw transitions @xcite as the width of drude mode is reduced by an order of magnitude .",
    "the infrared spectra of these parent compounds are dominated by the mid - ir peak , which may have the same origin as the peak we observe in fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 around 3000  @xmath4 ( 372  mev ) .    the absence of sdw gap from ir spectra of both fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 and fe@xmath5te ( ref .  )",
    "is also interesting .",
    "recent arpes study of a parent compound fe@xmath35te ( ref .  ) has also revealed that the sdw gap is absent .",
    "optical spectra reveal that spectral weight is shifting with temperature , and the generalized spectral weight analysis we introduced indicates that a typical energy scale for the shift is about 280  mev .",
    "the spectral weight of fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 is removed from the low - energy region , which can be interpreted as a pseudogap feature , however we point out that this behavior starts already at room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ref ] ) and therefore is unlikely to be related to sdw transition .",
    "all this indicates that the electronic structure of the 11 family might be different from the 1111 and 122 families , for which clear signatures of sdw gaps have been observed @xcite .",
    "ir studies on these two families have found a gap ( or even several gaps ) in the excitation spectra . on the other hand",
    "both the parent compound @xcite and a doped sample studied in this work did not reveal the presence of a gap in their excitation spectra .",
    "finally we address what happens below 8  k , when the system becomes superconducting .",
    "we have performed magneto - optical studies in 18 tesla superconducting magnet at the national high magnetic field lab .",
    "[ fig : magnet ] displays the results of these measurements .",
    "the magneto - reflection ratio r(18 t)/r(0 t ) is shown as a function of frequency . apart from the vertical offset @xcite , within the noise level",
    "the ratio is a straight line , which indicates the absence of field - induced effects in fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast with bafe@xmath36co@xmath37as@xmath26 with t@xmath3=  22  k ( optimally doped member of the 122 family ) , where clear field - induced changes have been observed caused by the suppression of the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "we speculate that field - induced changes in fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 are not observed because either they are below the detection limit of our experiment , or because the superconductiong gap is outside of our frequency window .    , and this part of the spectrum is not shown @xcite.,width=359 ]    [ fig : magnet ]",
    "in summary , we have presented the results of infrared and optical spectroscopy studies of novel iron - based superconductor fe@xmath0te@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the results indicate incoherent normal state charge transport and absence of well defined quasiparticles at all temperatures down to t@xmath3 .",
    "we have introduced `` generalized spectral weight analysis '' and used it to track redistribution with temperature .",
    "the analysis reveals that the characteristic energy scale for the spectral weight shifts is approximately 280  mev .",
