    "flat radio spectra , with power - law indices @xmath2 ( for @xmath3 ) represent one of the key features of the plerions ( weiler & panagia 1978 ) , that distinguish these filled - center supernova remnants ( snrs ) from a typical shell - type snr with the mean @xmath4 ( e.g. green , 1991 )",
    ". meanwhile , the origin of the electrons producing these unusual radio spectra is not yet understood ( e.g. green and scheuer 1992 , woltjer et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "radio electrons appear particularly enigmatic for the crab nebula ( see kennel & coroniti 1984  hereafter kc84 ) where the synchrotron spectrum extends with @xmath5 ( baars et al .",
    "1977 ) from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and then it steepens to @xmath8 in the ir / optical band ( marsden et al . 1984 )",
    "this requires an energy distribution of the electrons @xmath9 with @xmath10 extending over 3 decades of energy ( lorentz factor ) @xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , which then steepens to @xmath14 . for the mean magnetic field @xmath15 and the known age @xmath16 of the crab nebula , born in 1054",
    ", this steepening seems to agree with the radiative break @xmath17 ( kardashev 1962 ) both in the magnitude and position of the break .",
    "one might thus suppose that all relativistic electrons in the nebula , including the ones with @xmath18 below the radiative break energy @xmath19 ( at present ) , called `` radio electrons '' , represent a single population of particles currently accelerated at the pulsar wind termination shock ( rees & gunn 1974  rg74 ) that would produce an injection spectrum @xmath20 with @xmath21 at @xmath22 , and @xmath23 at higher energies ( in order to explain the x - ray fluxes with @xmath24 ) . however , the mean electron energy in such a spectrum @xmath25 , which is much less than the energy of the wind electrons upstream of the shock , @xmath26 ( e.g. kundt & krotscheck 1980  kk80 , kc84 , arons 1996  ar96 ) , whereas the energy and particle number flux conservation laws across the shock require that @xmath27 .",
    "an idea of current acceleration of radio electrons in the main nebula beyond the wind termination shock appears also problematic , because radio observations do not show any significant variation of the radio spectral index , implying an absence of effective electron acceleration sites there ( kronberg & bietenholz 1992 , bietenholz et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the remaining alternative is to assume that radio electrons in the crab nebula are relics of the history of its evolution ( shklovskii 1977 , kk80 , kc84 ) .",
    "the model proposed below reconsiders the evolution of the electrons injected into the expanding nebula at the pulsar wind shock .",
    "previous studies of expanding plerions ( pacini & salvati 1973  ps73 ; reynolds & chevalier 1984  rc84 ) have assumed an injection spectrum @xmath28 with @xmath29 starting from @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the origin of such a flat spectrum was not considered . in agreement with theoretical predictions ( kk80 , kc84 , ar96 , atoyan & aharonian 1996 ) , here i assume an injection spectrum with a profound deficit of electrons below some @xmath31 , for example in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 . for @xmath34 , the mean energy of electrons in this spectrum @xmath35 .",
    "this defines @xmath36 of the pulsar driven wind of electromagnetic fields and particles which powers the plerion ( rg74 ) .",
    "the electrons are injected into the nebula with a power @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the spin - down luminosity , and @xmath39 in terms of the pulsar braking index @xmath40 . a significant , if not the dominant ( @xmath41 , kc84 ) , fraction of @xmath42 is injected in the electrons , so @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the production rate of @xmath45 pairs by the pulsar .",
    "very generally , @xmath46 can depend mainly on the magnetic field @xmath47 of the neutron star and its spin frequency @xmath48 .",
    "because the basic time dependent parameter is @xmath49 , i approximate @xmath50 with a parameter @xmath51 .",
    "this results in @xmath52 with for times @xmath53 .",
    "this seems to be correct also generally , allowing a reasonable variation ( e.g. a gradual decline ) of @xmath54 , although this would somewhat change the relation @xmath55 . ] a model parameter @xmath55 .",
    "because of intensive synchrotron losses in the past , electrons were brought to energies much smaller than @xmath56 at present .",
    "for the energy losses @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and magnetic field in the expanding nebula declining in time as @xmath59 , typically with @xmath601.3 - 2 ( rc84 ) , the equation @xmath61 gives the radiative brake energy @xmath62 all electrons injected into the nebula at times @xmath63 with energies higher than @xmath64 are rapidly cooled down to this energy .",
    "electrons of smaller energies are affected only by adiabatic energy losses which do not change a power - law shape of @xmath65 once established .",
    "the origin of the flat distribution of radio electrons in plerions is readily understood if we neglect , for a moment , the adiabatic energy losses . then eq.(1 )",
    "predicts that all electrons that enter the nebula between times @xmath63 and @xmath66 with energies above @xmath67 will be soon found in the energy region between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 . since injection occurs mostly at high energies , a @xmath71-functional approximation @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , can be used to find the number of electrons @xmath74 accumulated in the interval @xmath75 .",
    "eq.(1 ) connects the injection time of electrons with their energy after radiative cooling as @xmath76 .",
    "then the distribution @xmath77 of electrons that have been injected at times @xmath78 acquires a power - law slope @xmath79 with @xmath80 . at time",
    "@xmath81 the injection rate @xmath44 starts to decline , resulting in an increase of the slope to @xmath82 .",
    "this can explain the spectra of plerions like 3c 58 or g21.5 - 0.9 where @xmath83 , and suggests that such plerions are powered by pulsars with @xmath84 not much less than their age .",
    "however , radio spectra with @xmath85 are produced by the electrons injected at times @xmath86 , when @xmath44 rapidly declines , and @xmath87 .",
    "this slope extends up to the current radiative break energy @xmath56 , if the energy of electrons in the wind presently @xmath88 , as in crab nebula , and to a smaller energy otherwise .",
    "this qualitative analysis demonstrates the role of the radiative losses for the formation of flat spectra of radio electrons in plerions .",
    "the results do not significantly change after we take into account also the adiabatic energy losses of electrons , @xmath89 . in the approximation of a homogeneous spherical source of a radius @xmath90 which expands with a velocity @xmath91 , the parameter @xmath92 ( kardashev 1962 ) . for an arbitrary @xmath93 , the energy distribution of electrons reads ( atoyan & aharonian 1999 ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 , and",
    "@xmath96 is the particle energy at an instant @xmath97 : @xmath98^{-1 } \\cdot\\ ] ] expansion of the crab nebula is approximated as @xmath99 with acceleration parameter @xmath100 , as observed ( trimble 1968 ) . in the region @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the contemporary energy of the electrons injected at time @xmath103 , the @xmath71-functional approximation for @xmath20 results in @xmath104 with @xmath105 which confirms the result derived qualitatively above for @xmath106 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath107 then implies @xmath108    the energy distribution of radio electrons in the crab nebula should extend with the same index @xmath109 over 3 decades of energy below @xmath56 .",
    "this requires that @xmath110 , therefore the radio spectrum of the crab nebula would suggest @xmath111 ( ! ) .",
    "numerical calculations confirm this very unexpected and far reaching conclusion .",
    "it may seem at the first glance to fig .  1 that all curves explain equally well the measured synchrotron fluxes from radio to optical , and even further to x - ray and @xmath18-ray regions ( where the fluxes can be sensitive to spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the nebular magnetic field ) .",
    "however , the radio fluxes of the crab nebula are known , and must be explained , with high accuracy @xmath112 . a closer look to the fluxes @xmath113 shown on the inset in fig.1 reveals that an explanation of the data at low frequencies is acceptable only if @xmath114 or smaller .",
    "this implies that the spin frequency @xmath49 of the crab pulsar initially was @xmath115 times higher than presently .",
    "for the spin period @xmath116 this corresponds to the initial @xmath117 .",
    "it could be a bit larger , @xmath118 , for the canonical value of the pulsar braking index @xmath119 ( the radio data then require @xmath120 ) . in any case",
    ", the derived initial spin period of the crab pulsar is much shorter than @xmath121 predicted previously ( see manchester & taylor 1977 ) .",
    "obviously , the reason for such puzzling discrepancy is to be understood prior to consider the model as realistic .",
    "this puzzle is solved if we remember that @xmath122 has been previously derived from the relation @xmath123\\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath124 , which is found after integration of the torque equation @xmath125 _ assuming _ that @xmath40 and @xmath126 do not depend on time . in that case",
    "the braking index @xmath40 can be expressed through the spin frequency @xmath127 and its time derivatives at present as @xmath128 .",
    "for the crab pulsar the measurements result in @xmath129 ( groth 1975 ) , so for @xmath130 and @xmath131 eq.(6 ) predicts @xmath132 , which then implies also that @xmath133 .",
    "reliability of these predictions , however , is questionable if we keep in mind that eq.(6 ) is only an _ approximate _",
    "formula for the pulsar age , and as such , it tells us that the model of a rotating magnetic dipole ( pacini 1967 , gunn & ostriker 1969 ) does provide a good agreement with reality because @xmath134 for any @xmath135 .",
    "however , attempts to treat this formula as a strict equation appropriate for _ derivation _ of @xmath135 would overestimate its real accuracy , and can be largely misleading because it becomes practically independent of @xmath136 already at times when @xmath137 .",
    "actually , the _ equation _ ( 6 ) has to push @xmath136 close to the current @xmath127 in order to be able to formally compensate the difference between @xmath138 and the known age @xmath139 . instead of that , a mathematically correct approach is to attribute this difference to the correction terms due in the approximate formula ( 6 ) . for example , assuming that @xmath140 but @xmath141 , we would derive @xmath142\\times c_{\\ast}$ ] where @xmath143 . for @xmath144 gradually declining in time , e.g. because of decreasing magnetic field @xmath54 of the neutron star ( @xmath145 ) , a correction term @xmath146 would readily allow any @xmath147 .",
    "some formal examples are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "thus , the knowledge of @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 at present may not be sufficient for determination of @xmath135 significantly larger than @xmath148 .",
    "information about the initial parameters of pulsars can be found in the radio spectra of plerions which they create .",
    "the results found for the crab nebula allow important conclusions about its history . the initial rotation energy of the neutron star , and hence also of the explosion that produced the star , reach the level @xmath151 .",
    "this confirms the earlier suggestion of chevalier ( 1977 ) that crab nebula was born in a normal type ii supernova event .",
    "meanwhile , the total energy residing in the crab nebula presently is only @xmath152 ( e.g. davidson & fesen 1985 ) .",
    "where is then the initial @xmath153 of the pulsar ?",
    "the answer becomes clear if we take into account that this energy has been injected into the nebula mostly by electrons ( @xmath154 , kc84 ) with a low - energy ` cutoff ' ( ! ) and the mean energy @xmath155 that at times @xmath156 was much higher than @xmath64 down to which they have radiatively cooled on timescale @xmath157 . because of that , basically all of the injected energy has been radiated away , and only a tiny fraction @xmath158 of the pulsar spin - down power @xmath159 was depositing in the nebula .",
    "the total energy accumulated in the nebula by time @xmath63 would be then @xmath160 .",
    "remarkably , because @xmath161 is still larger than @xmath162 , this energy might be _ increasing _ even currently if @xmath163 .",
    "in particular , in the case of @xmath164 predicted by the model for the magnetic field evolving close to equipartition with the electrons , @xmath163 if @xmath165 .",
    "numerical calculations confirm this unexpected result .",
    "the increase of @xmath166 at times @xmath167 ( to be compared with rc84 ) could explain the expansion of the nebula with a noticeable recent ( trimble 1968 ) , or perhaps even current , acceleration .",
    "the principal suggestion of rg74 that the magnetic field energy @xmath168 in the crab nebula is presently close to equipartition with @xmath169 of the electrons not just accidentally , but because magnetic fields can effectively reenergize the electrons when @xmath168 exceeds @xmath170 , becomes important for explanation of the observed small decline rate of radio fluxes , @xmath171 per year ( aller & reynolds 1985 , vinyaikin & razin 1979 ) . for @xmath164 , the calculated decline rate @xmath172 /t_{\\ast } \\ ; .\\ ] ] is in a reasonable agreement with observations only if @xmath173 .",
    "adiabatic reenergization of radio electrons in the regions of magnetic field compression could significantly compensate the expansion losses , effectively reducing the adiabatic parameter from @xmath92 relevant for a simple homogeneous model considered here , to much smaller values in the case of a spatially inhomogeneous study .",
    "note that the regions of magnetic field compression , like those around numerous dense optical filaments in the nebula , may be distinguished by an enhanced radio intensity , e.g. as diffuse _ radio",
    "_ filaments ( swinbank 1980 ) , but importantly , they will have practically the same @xmath174 as the rest of the nebula ( bietenholz et al .",
    "1997 ) , because the adiabatic energy gain ( or loss ) process does not change the power - law index of the electrons .    for the crab pulsar , a speed of rotation 10 times higher than presently implies a very high initial spin - down luminosity @xmath175 .",
    "the pulsar thus was injecting into the young nebula an energy about @xmath176 per year , which was emitted mostly in the form of x - rays and @xmath18-rays that could not be detected at that time .",
    "however , during the first years after the explosion , a significant part of this energy should be absorbed in the then opaque fast expanding shell of supernova ejecta between the nebula and an observer .",
    "this additional energy input into the thermally emitting shell can be the reason why the light curve of the supernova 1054 was declining much slower than that of a typical type ii event ( minkowski 1971 ) .",
    "the high initial luminosity of the pulsar could have also a strong impact on the dynamics of the ejecta outside the nebula .",
    "interesting consequences for the possible progenitor of the crab nebula could be deduced from the high angular momentum of the pulsar , and hence of the progenitor star itself .",
    "thus , the fast initial spin of the crab pulsar as appears evident from the radio spectrum of the crab nebula , suggests new approaches for understanding the origin and history of this prototype plerion .",
    "i thank f. aharonian , j. arons , m. bietenholz , w. kundt , r. tuffs , and h. vlk for helpful discussions of different aspects of this work , and r. bandiera for very useful comments on the manuscript of the paper .",
