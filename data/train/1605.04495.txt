    "lightweight structural materials have many applications in the aerospace and automotive industries as they can drastically decrease energy consumption and improve fuel economy . magnesium ( mg ) and its alloys",
    "are some of the lightest structural materials among metallic alloys , but many compositions exhibit very low ductility and highly anisotropic mechanical behavior .",
    "mg has a hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) structure that lacks the ductility and formability of cubic materials , due to the scarcity of easy crystallographic slip systems to accommodate an arbitrary plastic deformation mode@xcite . with the idea that a better fundamental understanding can help overcome these deficiencies , the mechanisms of slip operating within these lightweight material candidates",
    "have been actively investigated both experimentally and computationally for the past few decades @xcite .",
    "the easiest slip mode in mg is basal slip ; however , this mode only provides two independent slip systems @xcite .",
    "a key to achieving formability in mg is to increase the relative contributions of the non - basal slip systems to crystal deformation .",
    "it is believed that deformation along @xmath10 is accomplished by glide of @xmath3 dislocations on the pyramidal slip planes .",
    "there are two types of pyramidal @xmath5 slip systems that have been observed or proposed to accommodate @xmath10 axis deformation : pyramidal type i @xmath11 and type ii @xmath12 .",
    "these glide on different planes exhibit different atomic densities and hence are not expected to have the same activation barriers , dislocation cores , and response to solute atoms . to date , which type of slip system prevails in mg and its alloys is not very well understood .    over the years , experimental , analytical and numerical methods",
    "have been used to infer the dominant pyramidal slip mode in mg .",
    "experimental studies using slip traces on deformed single crystals or crystals embedded in grains have provided evidence for both types of pyramidal slips @xcite .",
    "similarly , post - mortem tem analyses on deformed mg samples have reported @xmath13 and @xmath3 dislocations on both pyramidal planes@xcite .",
    "the dislocations found after deformation were both of the glissile and sessile type . based on experimental observation , stohr and",
    "poirier @xcite proposed that full pyramidal - ii dislocations can lower their energy by splitting into two equal length 1/2 @xmath3 partials that spread apart while remaining on the pyramidal - ii plane .",
    "a pyramidal - ii dislocation with such a core configuration would likely have been glissile .",
    "recently , yu et al . studied the deformation of mg single crystals of nano - scale dimension and witnessed the glide of a pyramidal type ii dislocation in - situ @xcite .",
    "atomic - scale md calculations have not always produced results consistent with experimental observation .",
    "whether the lower energy sp configuration occurs has proven to depend on the interatomic potential and temperature . using lennard - jones potential ,",
    "ando et al .",
    "@xcite found that full dislocation dissociated into the sp glissile configuration at 0k and room temperature but not at 30k , wherein it dissociated into a sessile configuration of two partials connected by a basal stacking fault .",
    "the latter was proven sessile under a shear applied to the glide plane and direction . using a larger simulation cell and two other potentials , the embedded atom method ( eam ) and finnis - sinclair ( fs ) potentials , morris",
    "et al.@xcite found that the full pyramidal - ii dislocation dissociated into another similarly sessile configuration .",
    "more recently , with a modified embedded atom method ( meam ) potential , wu et al .",
    "@xcite studied the stable configuration of two @xmath14 partials on pyramidal i and ii planes .",
    "later , wu and curtin @xcite using finite - temperature md showed that via a thermally activated process ( @xmath15 k ) , the sp configuration for both pyramidal type i and ii dislocations could transform into an even lower energy state , which is sessile .",
    "the reconstructed core of the pyramidal - i dislocation achieved the lower energy state and hence was considered the less likely of the two pyramidal types to mediate plasticity . as an alternative approach , dynamic loading md simulations have been carried out to investigate which of the two types of pyramidal slip dislocations would preferably nucleate . among these studies ,",

    "most often , however , dft is used to calculate the generalized stacking fault energy ( gsfe ) curve @xcite .",
    "the gsfe curve is obtained by rigidly displacing one half of the crystal relative to the other half across a plane . from this energy profile ,",
    "the lattice resistance to move the dislocation and the possible set of partial dislocations that can produce the same displacement as a full dislocation can be estimated . to be consistent with the sp dissociation seen in dft and md simulations , the corresponding gsfe curve on the @xmath18 plane with displacements in the @xmath19 direction should possess a local minimum at @xmath16 . however no such dft - calculated or md - calculated gsfe curve to date exhibits this local minimum .",
    "the local minimum in the gsfe curve was thought to either lie elsewhere on the @xmath20 surface or not exist @xcite .",
    "atomic - scale simulations are well suited for providing valuable insight into pyramidal @xmath5 dislocation properties yet the inconsistencies in core structure and dislocation dynamics reported among so many atomic - scale studies clearly need to be addressed .    in this work , we study the core configuration and glide behavior of pyramidal type i and type ii dislocations under stress .",
    "direct experimental evidence is provided for a single @xmath21 dislocation on the pyramidal type ii @xmath22 plane .",
    "using dft we calculate the gsfe curve for both type i and ii pyramidal slip systems . in calculation , we show that proper boundary conditions are needed to allow atoms in the pyramidal planes to shuffle to reach a local minimum .",
    "it is then demonstrated that a minimum exists exactly at @xmath21 along the @xmath19 slip direction in the gsfe curve for the pyramidal type ii dislocation , consistent with the sp reaction and experimental evidence , and supporting the sp dissociations calculated by some md studies . with these relaxed conditions ,",
    "we show that gsfe curves from three mg interatomic potentials also exhibit a local minimum at the amount of same displacement .",
    "we also simulate the motion of edge and mixed pyramidal type i and ii dislocations using md simulation .",

    "figure  [ slip - py2](c ) shows the interlayer spacing of the two atomic layers from the upper crystal and two atomic layers from the lower crystal of the relaxed structures calculated from the two approaches . in the standard approach",
    ", we find that interlayer spacing increases as we displace the upper crystal with respect to the lower crystal .",
    "the interlayer spacing at the interface of the upper and lower crystal for a displacement equal to 0.5 is 1.86 @xmath4 compared to the bulk interlayer spacing 1.36 @xmath4 .",
    "the local shuffling of the atoms in the x direction in the x - relaxed approach compared to the standard approach is shown in figure  [ slip - py2](d ) .",
    "we observe that the relaxation of atomic positions along the x direction in the x - relaxed approach allows atoms to locally shuffle , altering their positions in order to minimize the interlayer spacing at the interface . evidently , the shuffling mechanism for shearing on pyramidal planes is critical for minimizing the total system energy .",
    "similarly , we studied the gsfe for pyramidal - i slip using the standard and x - relaxed approaches .",
    "the model for the pyramidal - i slip is shown in figure  [ slip - py1](a ) and contains 64 atoms and the periodic dimensions are 3.19 @xmath4 along x , 11.75 @xmath4 along y and 56.49 @xmath4 along the z spanning 16 atomic layers .",
    "because of the double lattice structure , the @xmath37 planes have two interplanar spacings , 0.41 @xmath4 within a corrugated plane and 2.02 @xmath4 between two corrugated planes . here",
    "the displacements are applied on the atomically dilute plane that lies inbetween two corrugated @xmath37 planes .",
    "we find that shearing on denser plane in the direction of slip requires much more energy than the dilute one .",
    "the calculated gsf energies for the pyramidal - i slip ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) using the two approaches is show in figure figure  [ slip - py1](b ) .",
    "the relaxation of atomic positions in the x directions minimizes the total energy of the system compared to the standard approach and shifts the local minimum to a normalized displacement of 0.4 .",
    "repeating the analysis of the atomic positions near the interface for the pyramidal type i plane shows that the main mechanism for lowering the energy of the system for the x - relaxed approach is local shuffling of atoms in the x direction , as shown in figure  [ slip - py1](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the local minimum in the x - relaxed gsfe curve implies that this dislocation can find a lower energy state by splitting into smaller partial dislocations .",
    "however , because the local minimum does not lie at 0.5 , the production of @xmath0 partial dislocations on the @xmath39 plane is not likely .",
    "most md studies and topological analyses have proposed pyramidal - i slip dissociations into partial dislocations with unequal burgers vectors @xcite an outcome that would be consistent with our x - relaxed gsfe calculation . in many of these works ,",
    "the burgers vector of the leading partial was not aligned with the @xmath38 direction .",
    "tem provided evidence of a @xmath8 + \\frac{1}{6 } [ 02{\\bar2}3]$ ] split although the pyramidal plane type was not specified @xcite .",
    "prior md simulations have shown that this extended dislocation can form in stressed crystals @xcite .",
    "alternatively , md simulations by li and ma @xcite suggests that the leading partial corresponds to a twinning dislocation with its burgers vector aligned along [ 10@xmath172 ] .",
    "hence , it may be the case that the local minimum lies outside of the gsfe curve for @xmath38 displacements .",
    "some useful implications can be gleaned from comparing the x - relaxed gsfe curves for pyramidal type i and ii slip systems .",
    "both curves are asymmetric , suggesting that if the dislocations are glissile , then the response to glide depends on the sense of shear . both curves also exhibit a local minimum along the @xmath5 direction , suggesting that a dissociated state for the full dislocation would be lower in energy .",
    "pyramidal i has a lower peak value than pyramidal ii , indicating that it would be easier to form or glide .",
    "to relate the fault energy to a critical shear stress , we calculate the derivative ( @xmath40 ) corresponding to the x - relaxed gsfe curves@xcite .",
    "figure  [ joos ] shows that the first maximum is slightly higher for pyramidal ii than i and thus pyramidal - i slip would require less shear stress ( 2.36 gpa ) compared to the pyramidal - ii slip ( 2.65 gpa ) in mg .",
    "although the x - relaxed dft calculated gsfe curves here can provide evidence of @xmath16 as observed in our experiment than those reported earlier from the standard approach and they can provide clues on dislocation core structures , it is still not possible to discern the actual core structure based on these curves alone . for this reason , in what follows , we calculate the configuration and response of the dislocation cores under stress using md .      as part of the md model set up , we first checked that the meam potential used in the present md calculations produces the same gsfe curve under x - relaxed boundary conditions .",
    "figure  [ slip - py1-py2 ] compares the md calculated gsfe curves from both approaches .",
    "the standard approach qualitatively gives similar results for md and dft ( see figure  [ slip - py1-py2 ] ) . in the gsfe curves from the x - relaxed approach ,",
    "on the other hand , the local minimum for pyramidal - i slip has lower energy compared to the local minima for pyramidal - ii slip .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that the meam potential could be tuned using the x - relaxed approach to better predict the energetics of these two different slip systems .",
    "notably , however , the x - relaxed gsfe curve for the meam potential provides the local minimum at 0.5 normalized displacement for the pyramidal - ii dislocation .",
    "we also produced gsfe curves for pyramidal - i and pyramidal - ii slip with the sun @xcite and liu @xcite embedded atom model ( eam ) potentials .",
    "figure  [ slip - py1-py2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) compares the gsfe curves from both the standard and x - relaxed approach .",
    "similar to dft and meam , the curves from these two other eam potentials experience a dramatic change when the x - relaxed approach is applied to permit local shuffling .",
    "in essence in both cases , a local minimum lies at 0.5 in the x - relaxed gsfe curves that was not present with the standard approach .",
    "these results suggest that these md potentials should predict that full pyramidal type ii dislocations could achieve a lower energy state by dissociating into the sp configuration .    in our high resolution electron microscope analysis , we found a single @xmath0 partial near a twin boundary on the @xmath41 slip plane ( figure  [ expt - result ] ) . in order to understand the observance of single @xmath0 pyramidal type ii partial",
    ", we carried out md simulations using the meam potential for the movement of a pyramidal ii dislocation .",
    "we first simulate the dissociation of a full @xmath5 edge dislocation on the @xmath41 slip plane .",
    "the simulation cell consists of 60440 atoms and is periodic in the x direction , which is along the dislocation line , while the surface normals to the y and z directions are free .",
    "the cell dimensions are 27.6 @xmath4 @xmath42 245.9",
    "@xmath4 @xmath42 206.7 @xmath4 in the x , y and z directions respectively .",
    "we create the full @xmath5 edge dislocation in the middle of the simulation cell using the elastic volterra displacement field as shown in figure  [ splitting - edge - py2](a ) .",
    "figure  [ splitting - edge - py2](b ) shows that in md , the full dislocation dissociates into two @xmath0 partials .    to quantify the separation of the two partials ,",
    "we perform a disregistry analysis@xcite using two @xmath41 layers near the dislocation core .",
    "to calculate the disregistry , we take two layers of the perfect crystal as the reference and compute disregistry vectors as :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the relative position between the @xmath45 and @xmath46 atoms that form a pair in the reference and @xmath47 is the relative position between the same pair of atoms at the relaxed layers .",
    "the disregistry analysis shows that after relaxation , the full @xmath5 dislocation splits into two partials separated by  22.6 @xmath4 .",
    "the dislocation core structures for the partials as well as their separation is similar as reported in the work of wu et .",
    "al . @xcite    next using md , we studied the response this sp configuration under stress .",
    "the stress is applied such that both the leading and trailing partials have the same resolved shear stress .",
    "figure  [ splitting - edge - py2](c ) and ( d ) shows the configuration after some time under application of strain . under a suitably applied strain ( = 0.5@xmath48 ) , the leading partial moves first while the trailing remains stationary .",
    "the trailing partial starts to move after the leading has moved 3@xmath4 .",
    "the stacking fault width consequently expands to @xmath49 and maintains this distance as they move in concert .",
    "this stress - induced response is consistent with the gsfe curve , in which the leading partial has the lower @xmath50 than the trailing partial .",
    "when the sense of the applied strain is reversed , the partial dislocations move in the opposite direction , again with the right hand partial moving first ( now the trailing partial ) .",
    "the steady - state stacking fault width shrinks from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "this analysis shows that the sp extended pyramidal ii slip dislocation is maintained and is glissile on the @xmath25 plane in both the forward and reverse glide direction and the separation distance of the two partials changes under positive and negative shear strain .",
    "thus we find asymmetry in the applied strains to move the partial dislocations towards the left and the right , consistent with the asymmetry in the gsfe curve .",
    "other mechanical phenomena are also known to split extended dislocation cores .",
    "application of non - glide stresses can cause further widening or narrowing of the stacking fault via the escaig effect @xcite .",
    "dislocation speeds reaching close to the speed of sound have also been shown to augment the elastic interaction fields between the partials such that the dynamic stacking fault widths deviate from static ones @xcite . in order to see whether these two partials can be separated further , we performed additional loading conditions , such as non - glide stresses or higher stress levels .",
    "however , in neither scenario did the two @xmath53 partial dislocations fully split apart .",
    "taken together , we can conclude that the two partials can not be separated far apart from each other when both are free to move .",
    "as another explanation for the observed single partial , we studied an isolated @xmath53 partial dislocation .",
    "we find that whether an isolated @xmath5 partial is stable depends on the applied stress . in one md simulation , we created a single partial dislocation in the middle of simulation cell and found that it moves to the free surface during md relaxation .",
    "this result is not surprising as creation of a single @xmath5 partial creates a stacking fault and the single partial moves to the free surface to remove the energy penalty incurred by the fault .",
    "however , under application of a shear strain , the single partial can be stabilized .",
    "the foregoing analysis would support the following possibility for the origin of the @xmath0 partial seen experimentally ( see figure  [ expt - result ] ) . through the dissociation reaction of a pyramidal - ii dislocation at the ( @xmath54 ) twin boundary @xcite , the @xmath53 partial",
    "is produced .",
    "the ( @xmath54 ) twin produces an internal strain field @xcite and under the action of this field , the 1/2 @xmath5 partial is driven to move a distance into the crystal away from the twin boundary . under this local field ,",
    "the partial is stable .",
    "the other product of the reaction lies at the twin boundary and may either be a sessile residual dislocation or the trailing dislocation . to explore this possibility , in another simulation , we pinned the left partial and applied a shear strain on the system parallel to @xmath41 plane .",
    "we find that the right partial can easily move far apart under applied stress as shown in figure  [ explain - expt - result ] .",
    "taken together , the observation of a @xmath0 partial dislocation on the @xmath25 plane can be explained by the motion of pyramidal ii dislocations , in which one energy minimum state consists of the sp reaction of two @xmath0 dislocations split in the glide plane .",
    "we also studied the dissociation of mixed and near edge @xmath55 dislocations on the pyramidal - i plane using the meam potential .",
    "figure  [ splitting - py1](b ) shows the result of this ms calculation for the near edge dislocation , which deviates 15.2 @xmath56 from pure @xmath55 edge dislocation .",
    "the dislocation dissociates on the pyramidal - i plane into two partials with a stacking fault width of 30.4 @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown that the mixed full dislocation relaxes to the same core configuration . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the energy minimum in the gsfe curve for the @xmath57 plane may not lie on @xmath57 plane but could be out of the plane . based on the burgers circuit drawn around the two dissociated partials , the burgers vectors of the two partials are @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] , which point out of @xmath57 plane .",
    "these core configuration conforms to experimental observations in an mg alloy @xcite .",
    "these burgers vectors lie on the @xmath6 and @xmath7 planes , respectively . as shown in figure  [ splitting - py1 ] , however , they are located within the @xmath57 plane .",
    "figure  [ gsfe3034 ] shows the gsfe curve for @xmath58 slip system obtained from dft and meam .",
    "the dissociated configuration of the pyramidal - i dislocation is consistent with this gsfe curve , which displays a local minimum at @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ splitting - py1 ] ( d ) shows the core of the two partials obtained after the dissociation reaction when starting with a full @xmath55 dislocation .",
    "the core of left partial is spread out on the @xmath57plane , whereas the core of the right partial is spread on @xmath37 , which is consistent with the earlier work.@xcite    we applied a shear stress on the nominal @xmath59 plane and in the @xmath60 $ ] direction in order to test the mobility of the extended edge and mixed dislocations . for both dislocations , it is found that right partial is glissile and moves away from the left partial on @xmath59 plane , whereas the partial on the left does not move .",
    "this shear in this direction extends the stacking fault between them . under reverse",
    "shear load , however , the partial on the right moves towards the partial on the left and before intersecting it , climbs onto the basal plane .",
    "we used first - principles density functional theory to study the generalized stacking fault energy surface for pyramidal - i and pyramidal - ii slip systems in mg .",
    "we show that allowing additional relaxation perpendicular to glide results in local shuffling of atoms near the slip planes , which lowers the stable stacking fault energy for pyramidal - ii slip compared to the pyramidal - i slip in mg .",
    "the calculated gsfe for pyramidal - ii slip with this relaxation approach shows that the burgers vector for the partials would be exactly @xmath0 . here using high resolution tem we also provide evidence of a single @xmath0 partial dislocation of a pyramidal ii dislocation on the the @xmath25 plane . to explain the observation , we performed md simulations and found that a full edge @xmath5 dislocation splits into two partials on the @xmath25 plane separated by @xmath61 . although it is difficult to further separate the two @xmath62 partials far apart when both are free to move , one partial can move far apart if other is pinned at a twin boundary or other defect .",
    "based on this analysis , we postulate that the hr tem observation of a single partial near the twin boundary results because one partial is pinned at the twin boundary and the other has moved into the bulk under an internal stress .",
    "we also simulated the dissociation of a full edge and mixed @xmath5 pyramidal i dislocation .",
    "these dislocations achieve a lower energy state by dissociating into two partials following @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] lying respectively on @xmath6 and @xmath7 planes .",
    "simulations of the glide response under an applied shear stress show that an edge pyramidal - ii slip dislocation can glide as an extended dislocation on the @xmath41 plane .",
    "the separation distance changes as it moves and depends on the sense of shear .",
    "only one partial of the extended edge and mixed pyramidal i dislocation can move , while the other one remains sessile .",
