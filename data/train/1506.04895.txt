    "experiments with cold atoms@xcite have provided the opportunity to investigate bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute interacting atomic gases . in the bec a macroscopic number of bosonic atoms , the so - called condensate , occupy the lowest - energy quantum state at a finite temperature .",
    "the phase of the condensate wave function provides the order parameter at the transition .",
    "bec transitions are generically expected to belong to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) xy universality class , which is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of an abelian u(1 ) symmetry . the same universal critical behavior is observed in the superfluid transition in @xmath5he ,  @xcite in transitions characterized by density or spin waves ( as it occurs in some liquid crystals ) , in magnetic systems with easy - plane anisotropy , etc .",
    "@xcite the xy behavior at the 3d bec transition has been supported by experimental measurements of the diverging correlation length in a cold - atom bosonic gas .",
    "@xcite cold - atom experiments have been extended to mixtures of homonuclear and heteronuclear bosonic gases,@xcite which also show bec phenomena .",
    "several theoretical studies have discussed various aspects of the behavior of mixtures of bosonics gases , see , e.g. , refs .  , such as low - dimensional behaviors , magnetic - like behaviors at the @xmath6 mott phases , etc .",
    "however , some issues call for further investigations , such as the critical behaviors at the finite - temperature normal - to - superfluid transitions which arise from different bec patterns .",
    "in this paper we study bec in mixture of 3d bosonic gases , focussing on the critical behaviors at the finite - temperature transitions arising from bec .",
    "in particular , we consider a system of two identical boson gases with density - density interactions .",
    "equivalently , we may interpret this system as made up by a single two - component boson gas .",
    "an example is provided by the lattice two - component bose - hubbard ( 2bh ) model @xmath7 where @xmath8 indicates the nearest - neighbor sites of a cubic lattice , the subscript @xmath9 labels the two species , and @xmath10 is the density operator . the hamiltonian is symmetric under u(1 ) transformations acting independently on the two species and under the @xmath11 transformation exchanging the two bosons .",
    "the two - component boson gas shows a quite complex phase diagram in the space of the model parameters , i.e. , the temperature @xmath12 , the chemical potential @xmath13 , and the on - site couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the following we set @xmath16 for the hopping parameter without loss of generality .",
    "we investigate the critical behavior of systems like the 2bh model by field - theoretical ( ft ) renormalization - group ( rg ) methods , mean - field and numerical approaches .",
    "we show that transitions in these two - component systems may be associated with different spontaneous breakings of the global symmetry @xmath17 this symmetry may break to @xmath18 when both components condense simultaneously , or to @xmath4 when only one component condenses , with two different universality classes for the corresponding critical behaviors .",
    "when both components condense simultaneously , the rg analysis shows that the critical behavior is controlled by a decoupled 3d xy fixed point ( fp ) .",
    "thus , the transition belongs to the 3d xy universality class associated with the symmetry breaking u(1)@xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "however , the irrelevant density - density interaction between the two components gives rise to scaling corrections that decay very slowly , as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the diverging length scale at the transition .",
    "such scaling corrections are not present in standard transitions belonging to the xy universality class , such as at the bec transition of a single bosonic species.@xcite in that case , scaling corrections decrease significantly faster , as @xmath23 .",
    "if , instead , only one component condenses , the rg analysis predicts a different critical behavior , which belongs to the same universality class as that of the continuous transitions in chiral models with o@xmath24o@xmath25 symmetry.@xcite we also present a rg analysis of the behavior of mixtures of nonidentical bosons with density - density interactions . in this case",
    "the phase diagram is characterized by the presence of bicritical or tetracritical points where various transition lines meet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ftrgan ] we present the rg analysis of the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory , which is expected to describe the critical transitions in two - component bosonic systems with density - density interactions . in sec .",
    "[ mfan ] we discuss the phase diagram of the 2bh model ( [ sbh ] ) in the mean - field approximation .",
    "[ qmc ] is devoted to a numerical study of the 2bh model in the hard - core , @xmath26 , limit . at the transition",
    "both components condense .",
    "we show that the results can be explained by a 3d xy critical behavior with slowly - decaying scaling corrections , as predicted by the rg analysis . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we wish now to classify the finite - temperature transitions in the phase diagram of systems consisting of two identical boson species with density - density interactions . for this purpose",
    ", we study the rg flow of the effective lgw @xmath0 theory associated with the critical modes.@xcite within the ft rg approach , one first identifies the order parameter .",
    "then , one considers the @xmath0 hamiltonian with the most general fourth - order potential in the order parameter that has the same symmetry properties as the original system .",
    "the possible critical behaviors are determined by the stable fps of the rg flow .",
    "each of them corresponds to a different universality class , associated with the symmetry breaking that occurs in the parameter region in which the fp is located .",
    "the stable fps determine the universal scaling properties , such as the critical exponents , the scaling functions , etc .",
    "note that only systems which are in the attraction domain of the stable fps undergo continuous transitions .",
    "systems corresponding to lgw theories with parameters that are outside the fp attraction domains , or that belong to the instability region , are predicted to undergo first - order transitions .    at a bec transition",
    ", the condensate behaves like the magnetization in magnetic systems , i.e. , @xmath27 as @xmath28 is approached from below .",
    "critical modes develop a diverging length scale @xmath29 , while the two - point function at the critical point decays algebraically as@xcite @xmath30 .",
    "the exponents @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are universal  they only depend on the universality class  and are related by the scaling relation @xmath34 .      in the case of a mixture of bosonic gases",
    ", we associate a complex field @xmath35 , @xmath36 , with each bosonic species .",
    "since we consider finite - temperature transitions of 3d quantum systems , we must consider a three - dimensional lgw model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the relevant symmetry of the systems we consider , such as the 2bh model ( [ sbh ] ) , is @xmath37 .",

    "the hamiltonian is bounded from below for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the quartic couplings @xmath41 and @xmath42 are related to the intra - species @xmath15 and inter - species @xmath14 on - site couplings of the 2bh model ( [ sbh ] ) . in particular , @xmath42 must vanish when @xmath14 vanishes , leaving two decoupled lgw theories , one for each bosonic gas .    general information on the phase diagram of model ( [ phi4s ] ) can be inferred by a straightforward mean - field analysis , e.g. , by determining the minima of the potential @xmath43 for @xmath44 the potential is minimized by @xmath45 , while for @xmath46 the minimum depends on the sign of @xmath47 . if @xmath48 , the minimum occurs when both field components condense , i.e. , for @xmath49 .",

    "according to the correspondence ( [ uvcorr ] ) , the equivalent model ( [ phi4s ] ) presents two stable fps with attraction domains separated by the line @xmath85 , along which the unstable o(4)-symmetric fp is located .",

    "this implies that it belongs to the 3d xy universality class , whose critical exponents are  @xcite @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "however , scaling corrections decay much slower than in the u(1)-symmetric theory with a single complex field , where the leading irrelevant perturbation has rg dimension @xmath89.@xcite this is related to the rg dimension at the decoupled xy fp of the interaction operator between the two complex order parameters .",
    "since the rg dimension of the energy operator @xmath90 is @xmath91 , the rg dimension of the interspecies interaction operator @xmath92 since @xmath93 , this result implies that the perturbation is irrelevant at the decoupled xy fp .",
    "however , since @xmath94 is very small , the scaling corrections , that behave as @xmath95 , decay very slowly .",
    "if the coupling @xmath96 is negative , only one bosonic component is expected to condense . in this case",
    "the transition is characterized by the symmetry breaking ( [ symmp2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the bec transition is continuous , the critical behavior must belong to another universality class , different from the xy one .",
    "the corresponding fp has been extensively studied within the equivalent o(2)@xmath97o(2 ) lgw theory.@xcite estimates of the corresponding critical exponents are : ( i ) @xmath98 and @xmath99 from the resummation of the six - loop expansion within the massive zero - momentum scheme;@xcite ( ii ) @xmath100 and @xmath101 from five - loop calculations within the minimal subtraction renormalization scheme.@xcite these theoretical results are also supported by experiments , see e.g. , ref .   and",

    "of course , models which are outside the attraction domain of the fp are expected to undergo a first - order phase transition .",
    "we finally mention that the critical exponents of the unstable o(4)-symmetric fp along the separatrix @xmath56 are @xcite @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this fp is unstable because the spin-4 perturbation present when @xmath106 has positive rg dimension @xmath107 at the o(4 ) fp .  @xcite thus , an o(4 ) critical behavior can only be observed by performing a proper tuning of the parameters of the model .    in the following sections we study model ( [ sbh ] ) in the hard - core @xmath108 limit .",
    "since the intra - species @xmath15 is naively related to the quartic coupling @xmath41 , we expect @xmath41 to be large in this limit , so that @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the bec transition should be characterized by the simultaneous condensation of both components , and controlled by the decoupled fp , with a low - temperature phase in which both components condense . scaling corrections , due to the on - site density - density interaction between the two components , decay very slowly .",
    "we also expect such corrections to be larger when the inter - species on - site interaction is attractive , i.e. , for @xmath110 , while they should be small in the opposite case @xmath111 .",
    "this is also suggested by the fact that the hard - core 2bh model becomes equivalent to the one - component model in the limit @xmath112 .",

    "we now discuss a system of two unequal bosonic species , such as that described by the more general bh model @xmath115 in this case we expect a more complex phase diagram , showing various phases with transition lines along which only one bosonic component condenses , and multicritical points ( mcps ) , where the critical behavior arises from the competition of the two distinct u(1 ) orderings . more specifically , a mcp should be observed at the intersection of the normal - to - superfluid transition lines where one of the components condenses .    the lgw theory describing the competition of the two different u(1 ) orderings of the model ( [ sbhg ] )",

    "we investigate bec in 3d two - component bosonic systems .",

    "we study the phase diagram and the critical behavior by rg , mean - field , and numerical methods .",
    "our rg analysis is based on a lgw theory with two complex scalar fields ( associated with the two bosonic components ) , which has the same symmetry as that of the bosonic system . in the case of two identical components with density - density interactions ,",
    "the relevant global symmetry is @xmath2 .",
    "the mean - field analysis predicts two different types of low - temperature phases .",
    "depending on the values of the on - site inter - species @xmath14 and intra - species @xmath15 couplings , one may have ( i ) a phase in which the exchange symmetry is conserved and both components condense or ( ii ) a phase in which only one component condenses , thus breaking the @xmath285 exchange symmetry .    in case ( i ) , which is generically expected for @xmath286 , the transition belongs to the 3d xy universality class .",
    "more precisely , the critical behavior is controlled by a decoupled xy fp , implying an asymptotic decoupling of the critical modes associated with the bosonic components .",
    "the density - density interaction between these two components turns out to be an irrelevant perturbation at this fp .",
    "it does not affect the asymptotic behavior but gives rise to slowly - decaying scaling corrections , that behave as @xmath163 , where @xmath22 is the diverging length scale at transition and @xmath287 .",
    "of course , these slowly - decaying effects are absent at the transition of a single bosonic species ,  @xcite where the leading scaling corrections decay as @xmath288 with @xmath289 .",
    "the presence of slowly decaying corrections makes an accurate check of the asymptotic 3d xy critical behavior quite hard , essentially because one needs to get very close to the critical point to make them negligible .",
    "these predictions are supported by a fss analysis of qmc data for the 2bh model ( [ sbh ] ) in the hard - core limit , i.e. , for @xmath26 .",
    "the ft rg analysis predicts that the nature of the transition should significantly change in the soft - core regime , i.e. when @xmath290 . in this case",
    "only one component is expected to condense .",
    "the corresponding symmetry breaking is therefore different , hence it leads to a different universality class in the case of continuous transitions .",
    "we identify this universality class with that of the chiral transition in frustrated two - component spin models with noncollinear order ,  @xcite which has @xmath102 as correlation - length exponent .",
    "our rg study also predicts the possibility of a critical behavior with an extended o(4 ) symmetry .",
    "however , such symmetry enlargement can only be observed by tuning a further parameter beside the temperature .    it should be stressed that the different critical behaviors can only be observed if the system is in the attraction domain of one of the fps .",
    "if this is not the case , the transition would be of first order .",
    "we also extend our analysis to the more general case in which the two bosonic components are not identical .",
    "the phase diagrams are expected to be more complex , as shown in fig .",
    "in particular , they may or may not show a low - temperature mixed phase characterized by the condensation of both components . according to mean - field and rg results ,",
    "if the mixed phase is present , the phase diagram presents a tetracritical point where four transition lines meet , and the multicritical behavior is controlled by the decoupled xy fp .",
    "when the mixed phase is absent , thus the low - temperature phases are characterized by the bec of only one component , the transitions between the two bec phases must be first order .",
    "in this case the competition of the two u(1 ) orderings does not lead to a multicritical behavior , since no stable fps are found in the corresponding parameter region ; as a consequence the behavior at the intersection of the transition lines is expected to show thermodynamic discontinuities analogous to first - order transitions .",
    "the rg analysis of bec transitions in mixtures of bosonic gases can be straightforwardly extended to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case . in two dimensions bosonic systems",
    "do not experience bec .",
    "the low - temperature phase of single species is characterized by a quasi - long range order , where correlations decay algebraically at large distances , without the emergence of a nonvanishing order parameter .",
    "the transitions to this low - temperature phase are generally of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type ,  @xcite characterized by an exponential increase of the correlation length .",
    "the phase diagram of mixtures of 2d bosonic systems may show bkt transitions such as those of single bosonic species , and transitions related to the breaking of the @xmath1 exchange symmetry .",
    "a similar situation arises in 2d frustrated two - component spin models , see , e.g. , ref .  , and references therein .",
    "rg scaling arguments analogous to those used for the 3d case allow us to infer that the critical behavior of identical interacting hard - core bosonic components is again controlled by a decoupled bkt fp .",
    "since the energy operator is marginal at the bkt transition , i.e. @xmath291 , the rg dimension of the density - density inter - species coupling is given by @xmath292 ( @xmath293 in this case ) .",
    "therefore , energy - energy or density - density interactions between the bosonic species are irrelevant also in two dimensions .",
    "unlike the 3d case , the corresponding contributions get rapidly suppressed when approaching the critical point , indeed they are @xmath294 .",
    "therefore , we expect that 2d identical hard - core bosonic components , such as the hard - core 2bh model ( [ sbh ] ) in two dimensions , undergo continuous transitions characterized by decoupled bkt behaviors with multiplicative and subleading logarithmic corrections,@xcite analogous to the case of a single bosonic species  @xcite .",
    "we finally note that cold - atom experiments are usually performed in inhomogeneous conditions , due to the presence of space - dependent trapping forces which effectively confine the atomic gas within a limited space region .",
    "@xcite the trapping potential is effectively coupled to the particle density .",
    "thus , it can be taken into account by adding a space - dependent trap term such as @xmath295 to the bh hamiltonian ( [ sbh ] ) , where @xmath296 is the space - dependent potential associated with the external force . for example",
    ", we may consider @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the distance from the center @xmath299 of the trap , which describes a harmonic rotationally - invariant trap .",
    "the inhomogeneity arising from the trapping potential introduces an additional length scale @xmath300 into the problem , which drastically changes the general features of the behavior at a phase transition .",
    "for example , the correlation functions of the critical modes do not develop a diverging length scale in a finite trap .",
    "nevertheless , when the trap size @xmath300 becomes large , we may still observe a critical regime around the transition point , with universal trap - size scaling ( tss ) behaviors with respect to the trap size @xmath300 .",
    "tss is controlled by the universality class of the phase transition of the homogeneous system .",
    "it has some analogies with the standard fss for homogeneous systems which we exploited in our numerical study , see sec .",
    "the main difference is that , at the critical point , the correlation length @xmath22 around the center of the trap shows a nontrivial power - law dependence on the trap size @xmath300 , i.e. , @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the universal _ trap _ exponent .",
    "tss has been numerically checked at the bec transition of a single 3d bosonic gas.@xcite analogous tss arguments can be applied to the bec transitions of two - component bosonic gases . in particular , the trap exponent in the case of the harmonic space - dependence of @xmath296 turns out to be  @xcite @xmath303 where @xmath32 is the correlation - length exponent of the transition , thus @xmath304 at the decoupled xy fixed point controlling the simultaneous condensation of both components , and @xmath305 when only one component condenses .",
    "our study is relevant to experiments in which a mixture of two bosonic atomic vapours is cooled to the point that at least one of them undergoes a bec transition and the number of particles is separately conserved between the two species .",
    "recent years have seen the development of many such experiments , with the two bosonic species being two hyperfine levels of a single isotope @xcite , two isotopes of the same element @xcite or heteronuclear mixtures of different elements @xcite .",
    "notably , some mixtures were also successfully loaded on optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the availability of a wide range of atomic species and the presence of fano - feshbach resonances allow to tune the intra - species and inter - species interactions between the two components of the mixtures .",
    "additional control can be achieved by acting on the depth of an optical lattice .",
