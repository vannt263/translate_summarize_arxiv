    "the channel spacing of the tdm mode is 15.6 mhz , and this gives a spectral resolution of 40 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we obtained 2.7 hours of on - source integration .",
    "we carried out data reduction with the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) .",
    "the flux density was scaled with the observation data of 3c279 ( j1256 - 057 ) for one of the four execution blocks and titan for the rest of three execution blocks .",

    "hence , we convolved the fir continuum map to the resolution of @xmath25 ( through tapering with a 100 k@xmath26 taper ) to see if we detect any extended source",
    ". however , we did not detect iok-1 in this map , either . as the rms of this map is @xmath27 @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 ,",
    "the @xmath28 upper limit on 1.26 mm fir continuum of iok-1 is @xmath29 @xmath3jy . in this section ,",
    "based on this flux limit , we constrain the dust properties of iok-1 such as its possible sed shape , dust mass , total ir luminosity and dust - obscured sfr by considering the effects of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on the observed continuum flux .",
    "the study by @xcite describes how the cmb affects measurements of fir continuum emission of high redshift galaxies .",
    "hence , before we derive and discuss constraints on the dust properties of iok-1 from the observed 1.26 mm continuum flux limit , we first describe the effects of cmb on fir continuum and how we actually apply them to our observed continuum flux limit ( see also * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "cmb affects measurements of fir continuum in two ways .",
    "one is that cmb heats the dust of galaxies to higher temperature as redshift gets higher .",

    "this equation suggests that effect of cmb heating on dust temperature becomes non - negligible at high redshifts ( e.g. , see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for a case of @xmath36 k and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the ratio ( hereafter referred to as @xmath38 ) between the dust continuum flux densities at a rest frame frequency @xmath39 and a redshift @xmath30 when including dust heating by cmb and not including it is @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the intrinsic dust continuum flux density of a galaxy , the dust continuum flux density after including the effect of cmb heating of dust and the planck function .",
    "this @xmath38 is a factor for correcting the effect of cmb heating of dust ( for example , see figure 3 top panel of * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of @xmath36 k and @xmath44 ) .",
    "meanwhile , another effect of cmb on dust continuum measurements is that cmb itself becomes a background against which fir continuum flux should be measured . @xcite",
    "have shown that the ratio ( hereafter referred to as @xmath45 ) between the flux at a frequency @xmath39 that can be measured against cmb at a redshift @xmath30 and the flux emitted by dust in a galaxy at that frequency and redshift including heating of dust by cmb is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a temperature of cmb at a redshift @xmath30 .",

    "first , from the literature that conducted single - component modified black body ( mbb ) fittings to the observed fir continua of the galaxies , we adopt @xmath60 k and @xmath61 for arp 220 @xcite , @xmath62 k and @xmath63 for m82 @xcite , @xmath64 k and @xmath37 for m51 @xcite , @xmath65 k and @xmath66 for mrk 33 @xcite , @xmath67 k and @xmath68 for ngc 6946 , @xmath69 k and @xmath68 for ngc 0925 , @xmath70 k and @xmath68 for ic 2574 , @xmath71 k and @xmath68 for holmberg ii , @xmath72 k and @xmath68 for ddo 165 @xcite .",

    "we adopted @xmath32 s and @xmath35 s obtained by @xcite for all the galaxies shown in the right panel of figure [ sed_iok-1 ] .",
    "then , to compute the factor @xmath38 at each frequency @xmath39 for each template galaxy , we scale the mbb with @xmath32 and @xmath35 to the peak of the fir emission of the galaxy s sed and calculate the ratio @xmath73 of emission associated with the cold dust at each frequency @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 is the scaling factor . with this @xmath73 , the equation ( [ m_nu ]",
    ") can be now expressed as @xmath76 using the equations ( [ tdust ] ) and ( [ c_nu])([m_nu2 ] ) , we convert the original fir continuum emission of each template galaxy at each frequency @xmath39 to the one including the effects of cmb and show the results in figure [ sed_iok-1 ] .",
    "comparison of the solid lines ( _ intrinsic _ dust seds ) and the dashed lines ( _ observed _ dust seds which include the effects of cmb ) in figure [ sed_iok-1 ] shows two notable differences .",
    "first , due to the extra heating of dust by cmb at @xmath0 , the peaks of the seds shift toward shorter wavelengths ( or higher frequencies ) . also , the rayleigh - jeans tails of the dust emission observed against the cmb ( dashed lines ) are steeper than those of the intrinsically emitted seds ( solid lines ) .",
    "this is because at a higher redshift cmb temperature is closer to the dust temperature , making the intrinsic dust emission more difficult to detect against cmb .",
    "the effects of cmb are stronger for galaxies with lower dust temperatures @xmath32 .",
    "especially , as the cmb temperature is @xmath77 k at @xmath78 , seds of the template galaxies with @xmath32 closer to this ( i.e. , m51 , ngc 6946 , ngc 0925 , ic 2574 and ddo 165 ) are more remarkably affected by the cmb effects than those with @xmath32 much higher than 21.84 k. as discussed in @xcite , considering the effects of the cmb is required for the correct interpretation of dust continuum observations as it would change estimation of a dust continuum flux density and thus subsequent derivations of dust masses , total ( f)ir luminosities and dust - obscured sfrs of galaxies .",
    "figure 2 also shows that the sed of iok-1 is neither similar to those of highly dust - obscured galaxies such as arp 220 and m82 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) nor less extreme dust - rich nearby spirals such as m51 and ngc 6946 .",
    "it is rather more likely similar to seds of dwarfs / irregulars .",
    "more specifically , uv continuum slopes ( see the insets in figure [ sed_iok-1 ] ) and fir continuum seds of ic 2574 ( morphological type sabm ) , holmberg ii ( i m ) , ddo 053 ( i m ) , holmberg i ( iabm ) and ngc 2915 ( i0 ) are consistent with the detection data points of iok-1 at rest frame uv and the alma fir continuum upper limit ( morphological types were taken from * ? ? ?",
    "as local dwarf / irregular galaxies have been observed to have low ir luminosities and dust masses , iok-1 could be such a system with low dust obscuration .",
    "meanwhile , conducting sed - fitting to rest frame uv to optical fluxes , @xcite estimated the upper limit on the stellar mass of iok-1 to be either @xmath79@xmath80 for a young age ( @xmath81 myr ) and low dust reddening ( @xmath82 ) or a mass as high as @xmath83@xmath84 for either an old age ( @xmath85 myr ) or high dust reddening ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "given that laes at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath876.6 ) tend to be very young and low dust systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and considering the non - detection of iok-1 in dust continuum with alma , the former @xmath88 limit would be more likely . for comparison , we have calculated the average stellar mass of 17 local dwarf and irregular galaxies ( sd and later ) in @xcite kingfish survey sample and obtained @xmath89 ( the stellar mass ranges from @xmath90 to @xmath91 within the sample ) .",
    "hence , the stellar mass of iok-1 is comparable to those of local dwarf / irregular galaxies .",
    "this also supports the idea that iok-1 would be a system similar to local dwarf / irregular galaxies .",
    "given our @xmath28 alma upper limit on 1.26 mm continuum flux density @xmath92 , we can estimate the upper limit on the dust mass @xmath93 of iok-1 from the following relation .",

    "however , figure [ lciioverlfir_vs_lfir ] implies that @xmath2027 laes and lbg-1 can not have similar @xmath14 s and similar @xmath13}/l_{\\rm fir}$ ] ratios at the same time , because the [ cii ] line is detected from lbg-1 at the @xmath13}$ ] about an order of magnitude higher than the @xmath13}$ ] or @xmath13}$ ] limits of @xmath2027 laes ( see figure [ sfr_vs_lcii ] ) . in any case ,",
    "observations of more lbgs and laes to comparable depth is necessary to fairly compare laes and lbgs in the context of @xmath14 and @xmath13}/l_{\\rm fir}$ ] ratio .",
    "after all , the locations of the @xmath1707 laes in the @xmath13}/l_{\\rm fir}$]@xmath14 diagram in figure [ lciioverlfir_vs_lfir ] are consistent with what is expected from the locations of these laes in the sfr@xmath13}$ ] diagram in figure [ sfr_vs_lcii ] .",
    "these two diagrams together suggest that the @xmath1987 laes , iok-1 , himiko and hcm 6a are similar to but more likely lower than local normal star - forming galaxies in @xmath13}$ ] , @xmath14 and @xmath13}/l_{\\rm fir}$ ] ratio .",
    "this implies that these laes have either lower enriched gas ( or metallicity ) and dust contents or different pdr structures / physical states of ism than local star - forming galaxies .",
    "also , the two diagrams imply that the @xmath202 lae , ly@xmath1 - 1 , could be a system similar to low redshift lirgs .",
    "we have conducted alma 158 @xmath3 m [ cii ] line and fir continuum observation of a @xmath0 lae , iok-1 , a normally star - forming galaxy in the epoch of cosmic reionization , reaching line and continuum sensitivities of @xmath2 240 @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 ( over a channel width of 40 km s@xmath4 ) and @xmath5 21 @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 at a resolution of @xmath217 , comaprable of the size iok-1 in ly@xmath1 .",
    "we did not detect the fir continuum .",
    "we constructed the uv  fir sed of iok-1 from its subaru / suprime - cam , _",
    "hst_/wfc3 , _",
    "spitzer_/irac , _ herschel_/spire and our alma data ( @xmath28 upper limit of @xmath218 @xmath3jy ) and compared it with template seds of several types of local galaxies whose fir continua were both corrected and uncorrected for the cmb effects .",
    "we found that iok-1 is similar to local dwarf and irregular galaxies rather than highly obscured / dusty systems . also , modeling the dust continuum sed of iok-1 as the mbb with the dust temperature and the emissivity index typical of dwarf galaxies and scaling it to the cmb - corrected alma fir continuum flux upper limit , we estimated the upper limits on the dust mass , total fir luminosity ( @xmath219  122.5 @xmath3 m ) , total ir luminosity ( @xmath220 @xmath3 m  1 mm ) and dust - obscured sfr of iok-1 to be @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and sfr@xmath221 yr@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "since total sfr of iok-1 is sfr@xmath117 sfr@xmath132 @xmath184 sfr@xmath119 @xmath11 yr@xmath4 , we estimate that @xmath222% of star formation in iok-1 is obscured by dust .",
    "moreover , we found that if we do not correct for the effects of cmb on fir continuum flux measurement , we underestimate the physical quantities related to dust , @xmath93 , @xmath14 , @xmath112 and sfr@xmath123 , by 24% .    on the other hand",
    ", we found a @xmath28 weak signal in the [ cii ] image and spectrum at the position of iok-1 and at 238.805 ghz , corresponding to the redshift slightly lower than the one previously estimated from ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that redshift estimated from ly@xmath1 was overestimated due to the absorption by igm .",
    "since the signal is marginal for securely concluding that it is indeed the [ cii ] line , we have treated it as non - detection and investigated the properties of iok-1 related to [ cii ] line using the @xmath28 upper limit of @xmath223 @xmath3jy ( over a channel width of 40 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the [ cii ] luminosity of @xmath13 } < 3.4 \\times 10 ^ 7 l_{\\odot}$ ] . in the sfr@xmath13}$ ] and the @xmath13}/l_{\\rm fir}$]@xmath14 planes , we compared the locations of iok-1 as well as other @xmath1706.6 laes previously observed in the [ cii ] line and fir continuum with those of other objects including local to low redshift normal star - forming galaxies , low redshift lirgs , low to high redshift quasar host galaxies and smgs and a high redshift lbg .",
    "we found that @xmath1987 laes at reionization epoch are systems different from lirgs , quasar hosts , smgs and the lbg but similar to or even lower than local star - forming galaxies in @xmath13}$ ] , @xmath14 and @xmath13}/l_{\\rm fir}$ ] ratio .",
    "this implies that these laes have either lower enriched gas ( or metallicity ) and dust or different pdr structures / physical states of ism than those of local normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "the present study is based on only one @xmath224 lae ( as well as a few other @xmath1706.6 laes previously observed in [ cii ] and fir continua ) and results obtained from the analysis of them might not be representative of the [ cii ] line and fir continuum properties of the general population of laes at the epoch of reionization .",
    "fortunately , the number of antennas has been increasing for alma as its construction proceeds towards full capability , substantially improving the sensitivity and resolution .",
    "this will soon allow us to investigate [ cii ] lines and fir continua of the statistically larger number of high redshift star - forming galaxies at a broader redshift range lower and higher than @xmath225 ( epoch of the end of reionization ) in reasonable integration times .",
    "such observations will give us more general insight into the obscured star formation , physical properties , ism state and even dynamics of high redshift star - forming galaxies and will shed light on their relationship with reionization and other galaxy populations .",
