    "the detection of large angular scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation was first reported by the _ cobe_-dmr experiment in 1992 ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ; bennett et al .",
    "1992 ; wright et al . 1992 ; kogut et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the initial detection was based only on the first year of flight data . since that time",
    "the dmr team processed and analyzed the first two years of data and found results to be consistent with the first year results ( bennett et al .",
    "1994 , grski et al .",
    "1994 , wright et al .",
    "we have now processed and analyzed the full 4-years of dmr observations : this paper is one of a series describing the results of our analysis .",
    "the maps and an overview of the scientific results are given in bennett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the anisotropy in the 4-year dmr maps using the 2-point correlation function as a measure of the angular power spectrum .",
    "the _ cobe_-dmr experiment was designed to measure the cmb anisotropy on angular scales of @xmath2 , corresponding to spherical harmonic multipole moments of order @xmath3 .",
    "the dmr has produced full - sky maps of the cmb temperature at each of three frequencies , 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz , with two independent channels , a and b , at each frequency . in principal",
    ", one can obtain an estimate of the cmb power spectrum from an anisotropy map simply by decomposing the map , @xmath4 , into spherical harmonic components and averaging them to find the mean power per mode @xmath5 : @xmath6 with power spectrum @xmath7 . in practice , however , there are a number of complications that arise . first , the need to apply a galactic cut to the data renders the spherical harmonics non - orthogonal , thereby coupling the @xmath8 coefficients and increasing their uncertainty .",
    "moreover , since @xmath9 is a quadratic form , any uncertainty in the @xmath8 ( whether due to coupling , instrument noise , systematic effects and/or foreground sources ) produces a positive bias in the estimate of the power spectrum .",
    "however , see grski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and wright et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for spherical harmonic - based analyses that account for these difficulties .",
    "an alternative to estimating the power spectrum is to evaluate its legendre transform , the 2-point correlation function . for a given power spectrum with multipole amplitudes @xmath10 , the predicted covariance between pairs of map pixels @xmath11 and @xmath12 with angular separation @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cmb temperature in pixel @xmath11",
    ", the angled brackets denote an average over an ensemble of universal observers , @xmath16 is the experimental window function that includes the effects of beam smoothing and finite pixel size , and @xmath17 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath5 .",
    "we estimate the 2-point correlation function in our sky by evaluating the average product of all map temperatures with a fixed angular separation @xmath18 where the sum is restricted to pixel pairs ( @xmath19 ) separated by an angle @xmath20 , @xmath15 is the observed temperature in pixel @xmath11 after monopole and dipole ( and optionally quadrupole ) subtraction , and @xmath21 is the statistical weight of pixel @xmath11 .",
    "this statistic is straightforward to compute , and offers a quick test of the consistency of the power spectrum from map to map .    in the approximation",
    "that the 2-point function can be treated as a multivariate gaussian distribution , one can form a likelihood function with which to estimate the power spectrum normalization . in ",
    "2 we present the 2-point correlation data in the 4-year dmr maps and examine its consistency from map to map . in ",
    "3 we evaluate the gaussian likelihood as a function of the mean expected quadrupole moment , @xmath22 , under the assumption of a scale - invariant , power - law spectrum of anisotropy . in ",
    "4 we compare these results with those obtained by other methods and summarize our findings .",
    "the 2-point correlation function , as given in equation [ 2pt_data_eq ] , is the average product of all pixel temperatures with a fixed angular separation .",
    "the data are binned into angular separation bins of width @xmath23 with the first bin reserved for all pixel pairs ( @xmath19 ) such that @xmath24 , the second bin for pairs with separation between @xmath25 and @xmath23 , and so forth . for the present analysis",
    "we employ the maps pixelized in galactic coordinates and use the custom galaxy cut described by bennett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , for which there are 3881 surviving pixels . to minimize cosmic variance we assign equal weight to each surviving pixel .",
    "the basic 2-point functions obtained from the single frequency maps are shown in figure [ 315390_fig ] .",
    "we plot both the auto - correlation of the weighted sum of channels a and b at each frequency ( the coefficients used to form the weighted average maps analyzed in this paper are given in table [ map_coeff_table ] ) and the cross - correlation between channels a and b. for reference , we also plot , as a solid line , the auto - correlation of the weighted average of all six dmr channel maps .",
    "the error bar attached to each point represents the @xmath26 due to instrument noise , based on 2000 monte carlo simulations that include only instrument noise .",
    "the plot clearly demonstrates excellent consistency of the 2-point correlations at 53 and 90 ghz , even in the absence of any galactic signal corrections . the 31 ghz data exhibit",
    "a small discrepancy from the mean data that is primarily quadrupolar and is presumably due to residual galactic emission .",
    "the data are quantitatively tested for self - consistency by forming differences of the 2-point functions and comparing them to simulations .",
    "the statistic for the test is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the observed difference between 2-point functions , with entries @xmath29 ( @xmath30 denotes an angular separation bin , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) denote specific data selections ) , @xmath31 is the mean difference , computed from simulations described below , and @xmath32 is the covariance matrix computed from simulations . for each realization in the monte carlo ,",
    "we generate a single realization of a scale - invariant power - law sky with unit normalization , and six noise maps , one per channel , with appropriate noise level and coverage ( bennett et al .",
    "we assume the noise is uncorrelated from pixel to pixel , based on the analysis of lineweaver et al .",
    "it is then possible to generate an ensemble of simulated 2-point functions for any desired auto- or cross - correlation function constructable from the dmr data .",
    "we generate such an ensemble for each of the six panels depicted in figure [ 315390_fig ] ; note that a given realization of the six combinations shares a common cmb signal .",
    "we compute @xmath33 as defined above for each possible difference and compare its value to the ensemble derived from the simulations .",
    "note that our computation of the covariance matrix from simulations automatically includes bin - bin correlations in the definition of @xmath33 . in no case",
    "does the observed value of @xmath33 exceed the 5% confidence upper limit derived from the simulations , which corroborates the visual consistency of the data .",
    "the 2-point functions obtained from selected multi - frequency combinations of the data are shown in figure [ 5390ng_fig ] .",
    "we plot the auto - correlation of the weighted average map , the cross correlation of the 53 and 90 ghz maps , and the auto - correlation of two maps which have had residual , high - latitude galactic emission modeled and removed ( table [ map_coeff_table ] and kogut et al .",
    "note the excellent consistency between the auto - correlation of the weighted average map , which is sensitive to _ all _ structure in that map , and the cross - correlation of the 53 and 90 ghz data , which is sensitive only to common structure in the maps .",
    "note also that the two methods used to model and remove high - latitude galactic emission introduce only small changes in the 2-point data , and hence in the angular power spectrum .",
    "this observation , coupled with the fact that the correlation and combination model maps render very similar 2-point functions , supports the claim of kogut et al .",
    "( 1996a ) that the free - free emission at high latitudes is 1 ) weak , and 2 ) approximately traced by the dirbe 140 @xmath0 m map at @xmath34 resolution .",
    "given a power law model of initial gaussian density fluctuations , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the power spectrum of density fluctuations as a function of comoving wavenumber @xmath37 , it is possible to derive the corresponding angular power spectrum of cmb fluctuations , @xmath10 ( bond & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath38 for the scale - invariant case , @xmath39 , this reduces to @xmath40 , which has one free parameter , the mean quadrupole moment @xmath41 .",
    "we customarily express the normalization in terms of @xmath42 , the mean @xmath26 temperature fluctuation expected in the quadrupole component of the anisotropy .",
    "we determine the most likely quadrupole normalization , @xmath22 , from the 2-point function by evaluating the gaussian approximation to the likelihood function @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath28 are @xmath45-dimensional row and column vectors with entries @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the covariance matrix of the correlation function .",
    "note that @xmath28 is defined differently than in  2 since we are comparing a single 2-point function to an ensemble here .",
    "the angled brackets denote averages over both measurement errors and over the ensemble of anisotropy fields implied by cosmic variance for a given @xmath48 .",
    "we estimate the mean correlation and covariance matrix as a function of @xmath22 using monte carlo simulations described above .",
    "the simulations account for all important aspects of our data processing including monopole and dipole ( and quadrupole ) removal on the cut sky . because of this subtraction , the bins of a given correlation function are not all independent so the covariance matrices derived from the simulations are formally singular .",
    "we invert these matrices to form @xmath33 using singular value decomposition , which permits an unambiguous identification of the zero modes that arise due to multipole subtraction .",
    "we then evaluate the logarithm of the likelihood , @xmath49 $ ] , in steps of 1 @xmath0k in @xmath22 , spline the result to a resolution of 0.01 @xmath0k , and identify the maximum .",
    "we test the likelihood method for accuracy by feeding the simulated 2-point functions into the likelihood function and solving for an ensemble of @xmath22 maxima .",
    "we define the bias in our method to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mean of the recovered maxima and @xmath52 is the simulation input normalization .",
    "the resulting bias depends on the noise level in the data , but ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath54 @xmath0k for the all cases except the 31 ghz data where it is @xmath55 @xmath0k .",
    "we correct for this bias in all reported results .",
    "the uncertainty we assign to @xmath22 is the @xmath26 scatter of the ensemble @xmath56 which typically exceeds the @xmath26 of the gaussian likelihood by about 10% .",
    "the corrected power spectrum normalization deduced from a variety of data combinations is given in table [ q_table ] .",
    "the smallest and largest normalization deduced from any data combination are 16.4 and 19.6 @xmath0k respectively , with values @xmath118 @xmath0k generally preferred .",
    "the normalization inferred from the 2-point function is now in better agreement with other determinations than was the case with the 2-year data .",
    "the change is due to data selection : with the 2-year data , we only analyzed the 53 @xmath57 90 ghz cross - correlation function ; with the 4-year data we have analyzed many more data combinations , including the auto - correlation of a weighted average multi - frequency map which yields a normalization @xmath11.5 @xmath0k higher than the cross correlation .",
    "the multi - frequency auto - correlation is more comparable to the data analyzed by other methods , and the 2-point analysis yields consistent results in that case . for a comparison ,",
    "see table 2 of bennett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in general , the normalization inferred from the 4-year data is slightly less than we found after 2 years , in part because of the extension of the galaxy cut . for comparison ,",
    "the 31 + 53 + 90 ghz auto - correlation with a straight 20@xmath58 cut yields a best - fit normalization of @xmath22 = 19 @xmath0k .",
    "as shown in table [ q_table ] , the effects of further modeling and subtraction of galactic emission are less than 1 @xmath0k in the normalization .",
    "while a likelihood analysis is capable of inferring the best - fit parameters for a given model , it does not say anything _ per se _ about the goodness of fit . for reference",
    "we have included in table [ q_table ] the values of @xmath33 at the maximum likelihood value of @xmath22 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "since the 2-point function is only approximately multivariate gaussian distributed , our tabulated statistic is only approximately @xmath33 distributed .",
    "however , we have used our monte carlo simulations to compute the expected distribution of this statistic and find it to be approximately @xmath33 with a mean of @xmath59 and a standard deviation of @xmath60 .",
    "the values computed with the dmr data are very consistent with this distribution , implying that the data are well fit by a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "analyses of @xmath61 have also been reported by banday et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , grski et al . (",
    "1996 ) , hinshaw et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , kogut et al .",
    "( 1996b ) , and wright et al .",
    "all results lie between 15.5 and 19.6 @xmath0k with most between 17.5 and 18.5 @xmath0k . in general , all methods for analyzing a given data combination give consistent results , while there is modest dependence on data selection .",
    "fortunately , the dependence on data selection does not exceed the statistical uncertainty due to cosmic variance and instrument noise . a reasonable conclusion to draw for the normalization of a scale invariant spectrum",
    "is @xmath61 = 18 @xmath62 1.6 @xmath0k , with the error quoted conservatively .",
