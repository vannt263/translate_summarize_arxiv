    "a prominent paradigm in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite is to employ flying qubits ( fqs ) and static qubits ( sqs ) as carriers and registers of quantum information , respectively @xcite .",
    "key to such idea is the ability to write and read - out the information content of a sq by means of a fq . by this , here we mean that efficient quantum state transfer ( qst ) between these two types of qubits must be possible on demand . in this picture",
    ", _ control over memory allocation _ appears a desirable if not indispensable requirement .",
    "for instance , one can envisage the situation where only one or a few sqs are available , e.g.  because the remaining ones are encoding some information to save . on the other hand , one may need to carry away only the information saved in certain specific sqs .",
    "alternatively , only a restricted area of the register of sqs may be interfaced with some external processing network where one would like to eventually convey information or from which output data are to be received . in such cases , the ability of _ selecting _ the exact location where the information content of the fq should be uploaded or downloaded is demanded . ideally , according to the schematics in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one would like the fq to reach the specific target sq , then fully transfer its quantum state to this and eventually fly away . evidently , this picture is implicitly based on the assumption that , firstly , the motional degrees of freedom of the fq are in fact fully classical and , secondly , that these can be accurately controlled . despite its simplicity , although interesting research along this line is being carried out mostly through so called surface acoustic waves ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , such an approach calls for a very high level of control .",
    "if we set within a fully quantum framework , the most natural situation to envisage is the one where the fq , besides bearing an internal spin , moves in a quantum mechanical way and hence propagates as a wavelike object .",
    "such a circumstance substantially complicates the dynamics in that , besides the complex spin - spin interactions , intricate wavelike effects such as multiple reflections between the many sqs occur either .",
    "this appears an adverse environment to accomplish _ selective _ qst : while ideally one would like to focus the fq s wave packet right on the target sq , the former is expected to spread throughout the sqs register .",
    "thereby , not only it is non - trivial what strategy would enable selective qst but even the mere possibility that this could occur can be questioned .",
    "( c ) sqs .",
    "the fq @xmath0 incomes from the left with a given wave vector @xmath1 , undergoes multiple scattering between the sqs and the perfect mirror and eventually moves away from the register with the same @xmath1 . ]    in this work , we consider a paradigmatic hamiltonian memory read - out model where the fq propagates along a 1d line comprising a collection of ( fixed ) spatially - separated non - interacting sqs and couples to them via a contact - type spin - spin heisenberg interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we start with a single sq and prove that a unitary swap between the itinerant and static spins is unattainable .",
    "the insertion of a perfect mirror along the 1d line , however , makes it possible . at the same time , since the transmission channel is suppressed there is no uncertainty over the final path followed by the fq .",
    "next , we find that even for a pair of sqs this can be achieved with either of the two sqs through an _ ad hoc _ setting of distances and coupling strengths . surprisingly enough",
    ", this means that feynman paths entering multiple reflections can combine so as to effectively decouple one sq while enabling at the same time a unitary swap involving the other one .",
    "even more surprisingly , the working principle behind this phenomenon is such that it is naturally generalized to the case of an arbitrarily large register of sqs , as we rigorously prove .",
    "consider the case where a single memory static qubit @xmath2 lies on the @xmath3-axis close to position @xmath4 . to read - out the quantum information stored in @xmath2 ( or write it there ) a fq @xmath0 is injected along the axis with momentum @xmath1 , say from the left - hand side .",
    "we model the @xmath0-@xmath2 interaction as a contact - type spin - dependent scattering potential having the heisenberg coupling form .",
    "the system hamiltonian can thus be expressed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the momentum operator of @xmath0 ( its mass being set equal to one for simplicity ) and @xmath7 is the coupling potential with associated strength @xmath8-shaped potential is a standard one , and for the present setup it relies on the usually met condition that the fq s wavelength is significantly larger than the characteristic sq size . ] . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the spatial coordinate of @xmath0 while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the spin operators of qubits @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively , i.e.  @xmath11 with @xmath12 having eigenvalues @xmath13 ( we set @xmath14 throughout ) .",
    "we ask whether or not , when @xmath0 will emerge from the scattering process , the internal degree of freedom ( i.e.  the spin ) of the two qubits have been exchanged according to the mapping @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ( joint ) input spin state of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , while @xmath17 is the usual swap two - qubit unitary operator exchanging the states of qubits @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "while there are in fact counterexamples @xcite showing that this is impossible , the scattering process between @xmath0 and @xmath2 can never lead to @xmath20 .",
    "owing to conservation of @xmath21 , this is equivalent to state that the transformation @xmath22 is unattainable . ] , we give next the general proof that such swap operation can not occur .",
    "for this purpose , let us define @xmath23 , where for each qubit , either flying or static , @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the eigenstates of @xmath26 with eigenvalues @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ( from now on , we omit particle subscripts whenever unnecessary ) .",
    "state @xmath29 is the well - known singlet , while the triplet subspace is spanned by @xmath30 .",

    "subspace the effective interaction is thus _ spinless _ and reads @xmath35 [ @xmath36 : the problem is reduced to a scattering from a ( spin - independent ) @xmath37-barrier . for a @xmath37-potential step @xmath38 and a particle incoming with momentum @xmath1 , the reflection and transmission probability amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ,",
    "are found through a textbook calculation as @xmath41 where we have introduced the rescaled parameter @xmath42 .",
    "these functions allow to calculate the reflection coefficient for the singlet and triplet sectors as @xmath43 where we have set @xmath44 . evidently , @xmath45 for any @xmath46 .",
    "this is the very reason which forbids one from using the above scattering process for implementing _ any _ unitary gate on the spin degree of freedom of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , hence , in particular , the swap gate ( [ swapgate ] ) enabling perfect writing / read - out of @xmath2 .",
    "observe in fact that , once the orbital degree of freedom of the fq are traced out , the final spin state @xmath47 of the joint system @xmath0-@xmath2 can be related to the initial one @xmath16 ( in general mixed ) through the completely positive , trace - preserving map @xcite @xmath48 where the first contribution refers to the @xmath0-wave component emerging from the right of the 1d line ( transmission channel ) , while the second to the one emerging from the left ( reflection channel ) .",
    "the kraus operators @xcite @xmath49 and @xmath50 describing these two complementary events are provided , respectively , by the transmission and reflection operators of the model , namely @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the projector operators associated with the singlet and triplet subspaces , respectively , of the @xmath0-@xmath2 system .",
    "notice that in the computational basis @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) a matrix element @xmath56 yields the probability amplitude that , given the initial joint spin state @xmath57 , @xmath0 is reflected back and the final spin state is @xmath58 @xcite ( an analogous statement holds for @xmath59 ) . via the identities ( [ defrandt1 ] ) and ( [ defrandt2 ] ) one can easily verify that eq .",
    "( [ defrt ] ) immediately entails the proper normalization condition @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , expressed in this form it is now easy to see why the mapping ( [ mapping1 ] ) is never unitary : in fact for this to happen , @xmath50 and @xmath49 should be mutually proportional , i.e.  @xmath61 .",
    "this is impossible since it requires @xmath62 , which can be fulfilled only provided that @xmath63 ( conflicting with @xmath64 proven above ) .    a strategy to get around",
    "this hindrance is to insert a _ perfect mirror _ at @xmath65 beyond the sq located at @xmath66 at a distance @xmath67 as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ( this is inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , where , however , a somewhat different system was addressed ) .",
    "first of all , such modified geometry suppresses the transmission channel eliminating the uncertainty in the direction along which @xmath0 propagates after interacting with @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , in the presence of the perfect mirror we have @xmath68 and eq .",
    "( [ mapping1 ] ) thus reduces to @xmath69 where now the reflection matrix @xmath70 is always unitary @xmath71 .",
    "more interestingly , eq .",
    "( [ mapping2 ] ) allows for the perfect swap gate ( [ swapgate ] ) to be implemented . to see this ,",
    "observe that since the squared total spin is still a conserved quantity as in the no - mirror case , the problem reduces to a spinless particle scattering from a _ spinless _ barrier @xmath72 and a perfect mirror which , via a simple textbook calculation , gives the reflection amplitude @xmath73/[1+i\\gamma(1-e^{2 i k d_1 } ) ] \\ ] ] ( recall that @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , a reasoning fully analogous to the previous case leads to @xmath74 with @xmath75 observe that @xmath76 is unitary because @xmath77 has unit modulus . to work out the conditions for realizing an @xmath0-@xmath2 swap gate ( [ swapgate ] ) , we use the fact that this unitary can be written as @xmath78 . evidently , @xmath79 can be made coincident with @xmath80 ( up to an irrelevant global phase factor ) if and only if @xmath81 .",
    "this identity is fulfilled provided that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are related to each other according to the function @xmath84 which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .     in eq .",
    "( [ g(kd0 ) ] ) [ panel ( a ) ] and @xmath85 in eq .  ( [ 2qstf1 ] ) [ panel ( b ) ] , which set the conditions for perfect swap between @xmath0 and the static memories .",
    "either function is periodic of period @xmath86 .",
    "note , in particular , that as the optical distance @xmath87 approaches @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) condition ( [ g(kd0 ) ] ) can be satisfied only in the asymptotic limit of infinite spin - spin coupling .",
    "moreover , there is a threshold @xmath90 [ dashed line in panel ( a ) ] that @xmath82 must exceed to ensure the existence of values of @xmath87 allowing for the implementation of the swap gate . ]",
    "interestingly , @xmath91 means that @xmath82 must exceed the threshold @xmath90 to ensure occurrence of the swap . to summarize , in the presence of a single sq and for a given spin - spin coupling strength , for any @xmath92 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] there always exists a corresponding coupling constant @xmath93 ensuring the occurrence of the @xmath0-@xmath2 swap .",
    "conversely , as long as @xmath8 is strictly larger than @xmath1 , there are always two distinct values of @xmath87 enabling the perfect swap between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .    before concluding this section , we point out that , based on the form of @xmath94 , when the optical distance @xmath87 is an integer multiple of @xmath86 ( i.e.  @xmath95 ) the above coefficients reduce to @xmath96 and hence @xmath97 independently of the coupling strength",
    "this situation is indeed equivalent to _ moving the mirror to @xmath2 s location _ : the chance for the fq to be found at such position then vanishes and its spin is thus unable to couple to the sqs .",
    "more in general , the property that two objects whose optical separation is an integer multiple of @xmath86 behave _ as if they were at the same place _ will be exploited repeatedly in this work .",
    "in addition to @xmath2 and the perfect mirror , the setup now comprises a further sq , dubbed @xmath98 , located on the left of 1 at a distance @xmath99 from it as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "hence , the spin - spin coupling term in @xmath100 now reads @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we aim to implement either an @xmath0-@xmath2 or an @xmath0-@xmath98 swap operation , i.e.  either the unitary @xmath104 or @xmath105 , respectively ( note that in any case we require one of the two sqs to be unaffected ) .",
    "analogously to the single - sq case , the mirror suppresses the transmission channel and thereby one can define a unitary reflection operator @xmath106 within the 8-dimensional ( 8d ) overall spin space that fully describes the interaction process output . in the spirit of scattering matrices combination via sum over different feynman paths @xcite , the scattering operator @xmath106 results from a superposition of all possible paths , the first of which are sketched in fig .",

    "the overall sum is obtained in terms of a geometric series as @xmath107 where although not shown by our notation , despite it involves qubits @xmath0 and @xmath108 , each reflection or transmission operator on the right - hand side is intended as the extension to the present 8d spin space . also , note that @xmath109 is a function of @xmath110 .",
    "the present setup ensures qst between @xmath0-@xmath2 and @xmath0-@xmath98 , respectively , in the regimes @xmath111 where @xmath112 , while @xmath113/2 $ ] is a periodic function of period @xmath86 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . condition ( [ 2qstf2 ] ) is easily understood : we have already discussed ( see the previous section ) that when @xmath114 the optical distance between @xmath2 and the mirror is effectively zero , hence it is as if the mirror lied at @xmath115 so as to inhibit the @xmath0-@xmath2 coupling .",
    "we are thus left basically with the same setup as the one in the previous section , which shows that if condition @xmath116 is fulfilled [ cf .",
    "( [ g(kd0 ) ] ) ] then @xmath117 .    to prove eq .  ( [ 2qstf1 ] ) , which is key to the central findings in this paper , it is convenient to introduce the coupled spin basis arising from the coupling of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we define @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) and the total spin @xmath123 .",

    "if the paths have different lengths , the actual path followed by the fq can be chosen by means of tunable beam splitters , in fact setting the effective sq - sq distance .    in practice",

    "preliminary studies for the cases of two and three sqs have been carried out as well , confirming comparable performances .",
    "a comprehensive conclusive characterization of the effects of static disorder in the case of an arbitrary number of sqs , though , requires a rather involved analysis and thus goes beyond the scopes of this paper .",
