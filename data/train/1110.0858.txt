    "the weak interactions between quarks induce a parity - violating ( pv ) component in nucleon - nucleon interactions , which is suppressed by about @xmath0 compared to the parity - conserving ( pc ) part of the interaction ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "few - nucleon experiments utilizing polarized neutrons are being performed or planned at the spallation neutron source at oak ridge national laboratory , nist , and other neutron facilities to map out this weak component of the nuclear force . due to the non - perturbative nature of qcd at low energies ,",
    "an understanding of how the weak quark - quark interactions manifest themselves in nucleon interactions remains elusive .",
    "traditionally hadronic parity violation has been described in terms of either low - energy transition amplitudes @xcite or , more commonly , a meson - exchange model @xcite . here",
    "we report on a systematic and model - independent approach using effective field theory ( eft ) , which includes theoretical error estimates and the consistent treatment of two- and few - nucleon interactions as well as external currents .",
    "in the eft approach , the effective lagrangian contains all operators consistent with the assumed symmetries of the underlying theory .",
    "the operators are organized according to a power counting which predicts the relative size of contributions to physical observables .",
    "each operator is accompanied by a low - energy constant ( lec ) , which encapsulates the unresolved high - energy physics .",
    "the lecs can not be predicted from the eft and are commonly extracted from data .",
    "once a set of lecs is determined , it can be used to predict physical observables .",
    "the energies of current and planned few - nucleon experiments to study pv nucleon - nucleon interactions are low enough that pion exchange can not be resolved explicitly .",
    "it is therefore convenient to use a pionless eft , eft(@xmath1 ) , which only contains nucleons as dynamical degrees of freedom ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using auxiliary dibaryon fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the leading - order ( lo )",

    "the pv interactions result in a nonzero longitudinal asymmetry @xmath8 for @xmath9 scattering .",
    "neglecting coulomb effects , the lo result for the @xmath10 case is @xcite and @xmath11 scattering are also given in ref .",

    "we have used relations given in ref .",
    "@xcite to rewrite the result of ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of the lecs @xmath18 of eq .  .",
    "a measurement at @xmath19 @xcite can be used to extract the shown combinations of lecs .",
    "coulomb effects can also be taken into account in the eft framework , but are found to be negligible at the considered energies @xcite .",
    "the pv low - energy @xmath20 forward scattering amplitude is related to the spin rotation angle of a transversely - polarized neutron beam traveling through a hydrogen target .",
    "the rotation angle is proportional to a linear combination of the lecs @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "for details see a forthcoming publication @xcite . using an order - of - magnitude estimate for the lecs @xmath18 ,",
    "the rotation angle for a target density @xmath25 is @xcite @xmath26    information on two independent combinations of lecs can be obtained from two observables in @xmath27 : the photon asymmetry @xmath28 in polarized neutron capture , @xmath29 , and the circular photon polarization @xmath30 in unpolarized capture , @xmath31 .",
    "the photon asymmetry @xmath28 at lo is @xcite @xmath32 while the lo result for the circular photon polarization @xmath30 is @xcite @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath34 is the isovector nucleon magnetic moment , @xmath35 the deuteron binding momentum , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) the scattering length ( effective range ) in partial wave @xmath38 .",
    "in eft(@xmath1 ) , the straightforward application of the power counting predicts that three- and few - nucleon interactions are suppressed relative to the leading two - nucleon interactions .",
    "however , in the pc sector the solution of the neutron - deuteron scattering equation in the @xmath39channel at lo shows a strong dependence on the cutoff @xmath40 used to regularize the integral equation @xcite .",
    "this cutoff dependence can be removed by promotion of a three - nucleon interaction ( 3ni ) to leading order .",
    "a similar enhancement of a 3ni in the pv sector would complicate the eft program , as additional experimental input is required to determine the strength of the interaction .",
    "an analysis of the loop diagrams appearing in the equations for pv @xmath41 scattering shows that no pv 3ni is required at lo and nlo @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order pv three - nucleon operators containing one derivative correspond to @xmath42 transitions with @xmath43 .",
    "their spin - isospin structure is different from any potential divergences that might appear up to nlo , and these operators are therefore not required to renormalize the @xmath41 scattering amplitude at this order .",
    "this ensures that for calculations with an accuracy of @xmath44 the five operators of the lagrangian of eq .",
    "are sufficient to encode pv effects , and the values of the corresponding lecs can be extracted from three - nucleon experiments .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the spin rotation angle at nlo for a deuteron target is determined from @xmath45 forward scattering using eft(@xmath1)consistently for all interactions .",
    "the result provides a constraint on a linear combination of the lecs @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath46 , and @xmath24 .",
    "an analysis of theoretical errors leads to an estimate of higher - order contributions of roughly @xmath47 as expected .",
    "the numerical calculations also confirm the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite that no pv 3ni is required for renormalization up to nlo . a rough estimate analogous to the one for @xmath48 spin rotation leads to @xmath49 which is of the same size as the rotation angle estimate in hydrogen of eq .   as well as the result of the hybrid calculation in ref",
    "the results presented here form part of a comprehensive study of hadronic parity violation in few - nucleon systems . using eft(@xmath1 ) , parity - conserving and parity - violating interactions are treated in a unified framework .",
    "the existence of a small expansion parameter not only allows the systematic improvement of calculations , but also the reliable estimation of theoretical errors . in the eft(@xmath1)formalism",
    ", low - energy pv processes are parameterized in terms of five lecs .",
    "the results presented here in principle allow the extraction of these lecs .",
    "future calculations in the three- and few - nucleon sectors then represent predictions of the corresponding observables . at the present , however , not enough experimental information is available from the two- and three - nucleon sectors .",
    "an ongoing experimental effort , in particular at the spallation neutron source at oak ridge national laboratory and at nist , is aimed at gaining improved constraints on pv observables in few - nucleon systems ."
