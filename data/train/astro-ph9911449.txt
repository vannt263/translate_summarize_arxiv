    "the determination of the intensity of extragalactic background radiation to within about a factor of two between the mm and ultraviolet ( uv ) wavebands has been one of the most dramatic developments in observational cosmology over the last three years ( see fig.12 of blain et al .",
    "others have been the routine identification of a large sample of normal galaxies at redshifts @xmath1 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the discovery of a population of very luminous dust - enshrouded star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 using the sensitive scuba submm - wave camera at the jcmt ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) ; see the list of current data in blain et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "in fact , the majority ( @xmath3% ) of the submm - wave background radiation intensity can be accounted for by the directly measured 850-@xmath0 m flux densities of galaxies detected using scuba in the fields of gravitational lensing clusters ( smail et al .  1997 ;",
    "blain et al .",
    "these developments are all extremely relevant to the development of alma , which will probe the same wavelength regime .",
    "it is very important to make mm / submm - wave observations of distant galaxies .",
    "observations of both the relative intensity of the submm - wave and optical background radiation , and the galaxies detected by scuba indicate that interstellar dust absorbs about 80% of the optical / uv photons emitted by young stars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the high - redshift universe ( blain et al .",
    "the absorbed energy warms the dust to temperatures of order 50k , and so it reappears as thermal radiation in the far - infrared ( ir ) waveband , and is then redshifted into the submm waveband . hence , a significant fraction of the energy generated in galaxies and quasars may be detectable only at wavelengths accessible to alma . when combined with observations of the unobscured fraction of energy made using the _ next generation space telescope _ ( _ ngst _ ; lilly , this volume ) , alma will play a key role in revealing the properties and structure of dust - enshrouded gas - rich galaxies at the highest redshifts .",
    "alma will have two key advantages over existing mm / submm - wave telescopes , including the mm - wave interferometer arrays at nobeyama , plateau de bure , owens valley and hat creek .",
    "the collecting area of the 64 12-m alma antennas will be over an order of magnitude greater , as will the 16-ghz bandwidth of the alma receivers .",
    "in addition , with baselines up to 10 km , the resolving power of alma will be many times greater , especially at the shorter submm wavelengths . at present the only samples of high - redshift submm - selected galaxies that have been discovered using scuba , which has a 15-arcsec beam .",
    "it is thus difficult to make optical identifications and follow - up observations at other wavelengths ; see frayer et al .",

    "( 1999 ) for an indication of the difficulties involved and the successes so far .",
    "because of the effects of fainter confusing sources ( blain , ivison & smail 1998 ) , scuba has an effective 850-@xmath0 m survey flux limit of about 2mjy . with sub-100-milliarcsec resolution",
    ", alma will be immune to confusion , and so will be able to carry out extremely deep pencil - beam surveys in all the atmospheric windows in the mm and submm wavebands .",

    "_ iso _ at 175@xmath0 m ( kawara et al .  1998 ;",
    "puget et al .  1999 ) , it is possible to construct a consistent picture of the evolution of dusty galaxies that are very luminous in the far - ir and submm wavebands ( blain et al .",
    "1999c , d ) .",
    "the models developed can be used to extrapolate to wavelengths and flux densities that are not accessible to current instruments , but are relevant to making predictions for alma .",
    "observations of co rotational line emission from two galaxies detected using scuba ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) , have allowed these predictions to be extended to include observations of molecular and atomic fine structure lines ( blain et al .",
    "the resulting counts @xmath4 are shown in figs1 & 2 ; two models for the population of very luminous dusty galaxies are assumed .",
    "first , the modified gaussian ( mg ) model ( blain et al .  1999c ; barger et al .",
    "1999 ) , in which the low - redshift luminosity function of _ iras _ galaxies undergoes pure luminosity evolution . secondly , an hierarchical ( hc ) model ( blain et al .",
    "1999d ) , in which luminous galaxies , with a dust temperature assumed to be 40k , are associated with the mergers of dark matter halos .",
    "the counts of non - merging , quiescent galaxies expected between merger events in the hc model are also shown . a cooler dust temperature of 20k , typical of low - redshift spiral galaxies ,",
    "is assumed for the quiescent galaxies .",
    "the evolution of their specific star - formation rate is assumed to trace that of the merging galaxies , and at @xmath5 they are assumed to be 100 times less luminous than merging galaxies with the same mass .",
    "the counts of quiescent galaxies are only expected to exceed those of merging galaxies at the faintest flux densities .    as more data becomes available over the next few years , from _ sirtf _ and bolocam , and in particular from complete redshift distributions of the galaxies detected using scuba and _ iso _ , these predictions will be refined",
    "; however , they already allow the key scientific strengths of alma to be explained .",
    "based on information at the alma website ( www.nrao.edu/alma ) , the crucial details required to assess the best strategies for alma surveys are listed in table1 .",
    "the key parameters are the sensitivity @xmath6  the depth reached by the array in a single pointing in a 1-s integration  and the primary beam area @xmath7  the area of the field that is observed in a single pointing . in order to assess the performance of alma in each of its seven bands , the time @xmath8 required to survey an area @xmath9 to a flux density @xmath10 can be estimated ; @xmath11 . if @xmath10 is fixed , then @xmath12 can be determined , and so the number of sources detected in time @xmath8 , the product of @xmath12 and the count of galaxies @xmath13 ( figs1 & 2 ) , can be predicted .",
    "note that the detection rate depends on both the performance of alma and the properties of the population of ir - luminous galaxies .",
    "the results of this procedure , which is outlined in more detail by blain & longair ( 1996 ) and blain ( 1999 ) , are shown in fig.3 , for both continuum and line observations .    the detection rate for continuum sources ( fig.3 ; left ) is expected to be greatest in the 230- and 345-ghz bands . for line emission ,",
    "the greatest detection rates are expected at 140 and 230ghz ( fig3 ; right ) .",
    "the differences in the detection rates in the different bands are due to a trade - off between the increase in the counts of galaxies and the decrease in the sensitivity and primary beam area as the observing frequency increases .",
    "the detection rates are expected to be greatest for continuum flux densities between 1 and 10mjy .",
    "this flux density range can be observed to a significant signal - to - noise ratio in a single alma primary beam in only a few seconds at 230ghz , and can also be reached using existing submm - wave telescopes . as shown in fig.3 ( left ) , the detection rate of continuum sources expected using future wide - field imaging instruments on single - antenna telescopes ( for example bolocam and scuba-2 ) at these flux densities will be comparable to that using alma .",
    ".sensitivities in continuum ( @xmath14 ) and line ( @xmath15 ) observations , each for making a 10-@xmath16 detection in 1s in each of the alma observing bands at frequency @xmath17 . for spectral lines ,",
    "a velocity resolution @xmath18kms@xmath19 is assumed .",
    "the sensitivities integrate down with integration time @xmath8 as @xmath20 .",
    "the spectral line sensitivity depends on the velocity resolution as @xmath21 .",
    "the approximate full - width - half - maximum primary beamwidth @xmath22 and beam area @xmath7 are also listed . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "alma is uniquely well equipped to carry out two distinct kinds of survey ; surveys to depths that are impossible using other facilities because of source confusion , and rapid systematic high - resolution observations of high - redshift galaxies that have been detected elsewhere . because of its great sensitivity , integration times per source will be short , and many will be spatially resolved .",
    "alma is the only submm - wave telescope with the resolving power and collecting area to carry out sensitive continuum surveys at flux densities below 0.1mjy , flux densities at which @xmath23 galaxies would be detectable at moderate redshifts .",
    "the results will discriminate between currently acceptable models of galaxy evolution ; see fig.2 . because of the large 16-ghz bandwidth of alma , spectral line surveys will be comparable in efficiency to those in the continuum at the most favored observing frequencies , and will be more efficient in the observing bands at lower frequencies .",
    "the expected detection rates of both line and continuum sources are shown in fig.3 .",
    "alma will be a very powerful instrument for making follow - up observations of sources that are detected using other instruments , in the x - ray , optical , near - ir , mid - ir , far - ir and mm / submm wavebands .",
    "for example , optically - selected lyman - break galaxies are typically expected to have 850-@xmath0 m flux densities of order 0.2mjy ( chapman et al .  2000 ; peacock et al .",
    ". a 5-@xmath16 detection of these galaxies at this frequency could be made in about 10min using alma .",
    "similar investigations to search for dust continuum and spectral line emission from large numbers of optical- , ir- and x - ray - selected high - redshift qsos , in radio galaxies and even in gamma - ray bursts ( blain & natarajan 2000 ) can also be conducted .",
    "galaxies discovered at flux densities @xmath24mjy at 175@xmath0 m using _ iso _ ( kawara et al .  1998 ; puget et al .",
    "1999 ) would be expected to have flux densities of order 5mjy at 850@xmath0 m if @xmath25 .",
    "much larger samples of similar galaxies are expected to be compiled during the next few years using _ sirtf _ and _ iris / astro - f_. the small aperture of these facilities means that the positional uncertainty of the detected sources is large  about 1arcmin .",
    "however , alma is sufficiently sensitive to make a rapid scan over a 15-beam , 1-arcmin@xmath26 field to this depth in less than 1min to locate the emission . a high signal - to - noise alma image of the located source",
    "could then be made in less than 10s in each observing band .",
    "large samples of submm - selected galaxies will be produced by the bolocam and scuba-2 cameras on the ground and by the _",
    "planck surveyor _ , _",
    "h2l2 _ and _ first _ space missions . alma and",
    "_ planck _ are exceedingly complementary facilities . while the _ planck _ all - sky submm - wave survey is primarily intended to map structure in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation in unprecedented detail at angular scales greater than 4arcmin , of order @xmath27 galaxies should also be detected at a frequency of 350ghz ( blain 1998 ) .",
    "each galaxy will have a flux density greater than 100mjy . at the same frequency",
    ", alma can scan a 16-arcmin@xmath26 region to the 10-@xmath16 sensitivity limit of 100mjy that is required to locate the position of the _ planck _ source to within 1arcsec in only 3s .",
    "this observation would require only 12ms of observing time in each primary beam , if efficient mosaicking of different fields can be achieved",
    ". the required scan rate of up to 0.5degs@xmath19 is within the specifications of the alma antennas .",
    "hence , alma could locate _",
    "sources very efficiently , and then observe them at all available wavelengths in only a few tens of seconds per object .",
    "the result will be a catalog of all the most luminous submm galaxies and agn on the sky , a significant fraction ( up to 10% ) of which are expected to be gravitational lenses ( blain 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the results will also reduce the level of foreground contamination of the _ planck _ cmb signal .",
    "gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies was exploited in the first submm - wave surveys to increase the effective sensitivity of the scuba instrument and to reduce the effects of source confusion ( smail et al .",
    "alma will have such high resolution that it can carry out critical line mapping  targeted imaging of high - magnification regions of the background sky behind rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "magnification factors of several tens are known to be found in these regions for high - redshift galaxies , and so galaxies with unmagnified flux densities less than 1@xmath0jy could plausibly be detected .",
    "these flux densities correspond to galaxies with luminosities @xmath28l@xmath29 , much less than @xmath23 , at very high redshifts .",
    "the large magnification in these regions of clusters are associated with strong shearing of the images , and so the submm emission from dust and gas in the star - forming constituent fragments of primordial galaxies could be resolved by alma , perhaps allowing their morphologies and internal dynamics to be reconstructed .      the detailed , resolved co maps made of known gravitational lenses , for example the cloverleaf qso ( kneib et al .",
    "1998 ) , have demonstrated directly that existing mm - wave interferometers can be used to image such objects .",
    "the much greater resolving power and sensitivity of alma will allow these observations to be carried out routinely in only a few minutes .",
    "observations of fainter lensed galaxies using alma , and direct searches for lensed background galaxies in the fields of elliptical galaxies and edge - on spiral galaxies ( blain , mller & maller 1999a ) should allow both extremely faint counts of dusty galaxies to be determined and the mass distribution of dark - matter halos to be probed .",
    "molecular absorption lines in galaxies along the line of sight to luminous continuum radiation sources have been studied ( see for example wiklind & combes 1996 ) .",
    "these observations reveal details of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of normal galaxies at moderate redshifts . in the case of strong gravitational lenses , several different lines of sight through the lensing galaxy , provided by the multiple images ,",
    "can be studied .",
    "the results may allow differential extinctions to be measured , and thus provide more information with which to constrain both the mass distribution within the lens and the geometry and expansion rate of the universe , in addition to providing templates for extinction curves in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this type of observation will be very easy using alma .",
    "the internal dynamics of cold gas in lensing galaxies will be resolved in detail and accurate redshifts found .",
    "alma will be a submm instrument of unprecedented sensitivity and resolving power , both for continuum and line observations .",
    "ultradeep surveys for dust and gas in high - redshift galaxies will allow the progress of galaxy evolution to be traced in more detail , both as a general process and from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "high - resolution , high signal - to - noise follow - up observations of galaxies detected using other instruments will allow the physical conditions in the ism of a wide range of high - redshift galaxies to be probed",
    ". alma will have the sensitivity , resolving power , and wide spectroscopic bandwidth to search for and to study galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by galaxies , groups and clusters , allowing its performance to be enhanced further by exploiting gravitational telescopes .",
