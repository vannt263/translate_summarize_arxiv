    "significant progress has been made over the last few years to understand the distribution and origin of extra - planar gas in the halo of the milky way .",
    "studies of the metal content of intermediate- and high - velocity clouds - neutral gas clouds embedded in the hot halo with radial velocities different from those expected from galactic rotation - have shown that various different processes contribute to the neutral gas flow in the halo .",
    "intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) appear to located closer to the disk at @xmath5-heights @xmath6 kpc , typically .",
    "they have metal abundances similar to those found in the disk of the milky way ( richter et al.2001a , 2001b ) and probably represent gas that is circulating from the milky way disk into the halo and back , for instance as part of a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ) .",
    "in contrast , most of the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) appear to have metallicities lower than in the milky way disk ( wakker et al.1999 ; lu et al.1998 ; richter et al.2001b ) and thus are probably extragalactic in origin .",
    "these measurements demonstrate that the milky way is still in a formation process , accreting gas and stars from satellite galaxies and the intergalactic medium , and expelling gaseous material into the halo as a result of star formation in the disk .",
    "next to the distribution and origin of the gas in the milky way halo , its physical properties are of great interest as well .",
    "the galactic halo gas is an extreme multi - phase medium with temperatures ranging from @xmath7 to several million degrees kelvin . although the large hvc complexes like complex c and the magellanic stream span several kpc in the halo , small - scale structure in this gas is present down to scales of several au ( e.g. , meyer & lauroesch 1999 ) . without beeing influenced by local star formation , the the milky way s extra - planar gas represents an excellent laboratory to study physcial processes in the diffuse interstellar and intergalactic medium .",
    "molecular hydrogen is an excellent diagnostic tool to investigate physical conditions in the interstellar and intergalactic medium ( ism and igm , respectively ) .",
    "a large number of h@xmath0 absorption lines from the lyman and werner band are available in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) in the range between @xmath8 and @xmath9  .",
    "the _ orbiting and retrievable far and extreme ultraviolet spectrometer _ ( orfeus ) was the first instrument that allowed us to study h@xmath0 absorption in ivcs and hvcs , but these orfeus observations ( due to the low sensitivity ) were limited to only a few stellar background sources in the halo and the magellanic clouds ( richter et al.1999 ; gringel et al.2000 ; bluhm et al.2001 ) . with the availability of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( fuse ) in 1999 ( e.g. , moos et al.2000 ) it has become possible to systematically study the distribution and abundance of diffuse h@xmath0 in the halo along a large number of sight lines towards stars in the halo and the magellanic clouds , and towards quasars ( e.g. , richter et al.2001 ; sembach et al.2001 ; richter et al.2003c ) .    the h@xmath0 abundance in the diffuse ism is balanced by the formation of molecules on the surface of dust grains and the h@xmath0 destruction by the dissociating uv radiation .",
    "the volume densities of h@xmath0 and hi , @xmath10(hi ) and @xmath10(h@xmath0 ) , are linked to the total hydrogen volume density , @xmath11 , the h@xmath0 grain formation rate , @xmath12 , and the photoabsorption rate , @xmath13 , in a formation - dissociation equilibrium ( spitzer 1978 ; richter et al.2003 ) :",
    "@xmath14    in this equation , @xmath15 is the probability that the molecule is dissociated after photoabsorption , @xmath16(hi ) and @xmath16(h@xmath0 ) are the measured hi and h@xmath0 column densities , and @xmath17 is a scaling factor that accounts for the possibility that only a fraction of the hi is physically related to the h@xmath0 gas . for known photoabsorption and grain formation rates and @xmath18 one can use equation ( 1 ) to estimate gas volume densities from measured hi and h@xmath0 column densities .",
    "the size of an h@xmath0 absorbing structure , @xmath19 , then can easily be calculated from @xmath16(hi and @xmath20 via @xmath21(hi)@xmath22 .    also the rotational excitation of the h@xmath0 molecules can be used to investigate phyiscal properties of the ism and igm .",
    "the lowest rotational energy states of h@xmath0 ( rotational levels @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are usually excited by collisions , so that the column density ratio @xmath25 serves as a measure for the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "if one plots the column densities @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( divided by the quantum - mechanical statistical weight , @xmath28 ) against the excitation energy , @xmath29 , one can derive the temperature @xmath30 by fitting a boltzmann distribution to the data points .",
    "also higher rotational states ( e.g. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) normally are excited , but for these states other excitation mechanisms such as uv photon pumping and h@xmath0 formation pumping are often dominating .",
    "a number of positive detections of h@xmath0 absorption with fuse and orfeus have been reported for both ivcs and hvcs , as listed in table 1 . the first detection of h@xmath0 in a galactic halo cloud was presented by richter et al.(1999 ) in the high - velocity gas in front of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "since then , h@xmath0 absorption in halo gas has been found in several intermediate- and high - velocity clouds , such as the iv arch , lliv arch , iv spur , complex gp , draco cloud , lmc - ivc , lmc - hvc , and the magellanic stream ( see table 1 for details ) . in all cases ,",
    "the observed column densities are low ( log @xmath16(h@xmath33 ) , implying that the h@xmath0 resides in a predominantly neutral gas phase .",
    "as expected , h@xmath0 absorption preferentially occurs in halo clouds that have a high metal and dust abundance ( see , e.g. , richter et al.1999 ) as an example , we show in fig.1 the fuse spectrum of the quasar pg1351 + 640 in the range between @xmath34 and @xmath35  , where a number of h@xmath0 lines from various rotational states are present .",
    "halo h@xmath0 absorption at negative intermediate velocities from gas in the iv arch ( core iv19 ) is clearly visible in the various h@xmath0 lines shown .",
    "the two - component h@xmath0 absorption pattern ( milky way disk absorption near zero velocities , ivc h@xmath0 absorption near @xmath36 kms@xmath37 ) can be well approximated by a two - component gaussian fit ( solid line ) .",

    "with fuse , we have systematically studied the properties of the h@xmath0 gas in ivcs towards a large number ( 56 ) of mostly extragalactic background sources ( richter et al.2003 ) .",
    "the sample includes 61 ivc components with hi column densities @xmath67 @xmath68 and radial velocities @xmath69 kms@xmath37 . in fuse spectra with good signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n@xmath70 per resolution element ) we found 14 clear detections of h@xmath0 in ivc gas with h@xmath0 column densities between @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath68",
    "( see also table 1 ) . in lower s / n",
    "data , h@xmath0 absorption in ivc gas was tentatively detected in additional 17 cases .",
    "the molecular hydrogen fraction in these clouds , @xmath73(h@xmath74(hi)@xmath75h@xmath76 $ ] , varies between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath0 lives in a relatively dense , mostly neutral gas phase that probably is linked to the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) in these clouds .",
    "we now can use equation ( 1 ) to determine the hydrogen volume density and the thickness of the absorbing structure .",
    "the h@xmath0 photoabsorption rate in the halo , @xmath13 , depends on the mean ultraviolet radiation field at a height @xmath5 above the galactic plane .",
    "the models of wolfire et al.(1995 ) predict that that the radiation field at @xmath79 kpc above the disk is approximately 50 percent of that within the disk , suggesting that the photoabsorption rate in the halo is @xmath80 s@xmath37 ( see richter et al.2003 ) .",
    "if we now assume that the h@xmath0 grain formation rate in ivcs , @xmath12 , is roughly similar to that within the disk , and further set @xmath81 , the h@xmath0 and hi column densities measured for our ivc sample imply mean hi volume densities of @xmath82 @xmath3 and linear diameters of the h@xmath0 absorbing structures of @xmath83 pc .",
    "moreover , if one considers the rotational excitation of the halo h@xmath0 gas that can be measured for some of the ivc sight lines , one finds for the kinetic temperature of this gas a conservative upper limit of @xmath84 k. given the relatively high detection rate of h@xmath0 in these clouds , the measurements indicate that the cnm phase in ivcs is ubiquitous .",
    "most likely , the cnm filaments are embedded in a more tenuous gas phase that corresponds to the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "a particularly interesting region to study small - scale structure in the milky way halo is the intermediate- and high - velocity gas in direction of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . in this gas complex , h@xmath0 absorption in intermediate- and high - velocity halo gas",
    "was detected for the first time based on data obtained with the orfeus instrument ( richter et al.1999 ) .",
    "we recently have reanalyzed the h@xmath0 content of the ivc towards the lmc using high s / n fuse data of lmc background stars ( richter , sembach , & howk 2003 ) . towards the bright lmc star sk @xmath456880 h@xmath0 absorption at intermediate velocities near @xmath60 kms@xmath37 ( lsr ) is particularly well defined .",
    "weak h@xmath0 absorption in the hvc near @xmath85 kms@xmath37 is detected , too . also other sight lines towards lmc stars",
    "possibly exhibit h@xmath0 absorption at intermediate and high velocities , but their spectra often are difficult to analyze because of blending problems and irregular stellar background continua . towards sk",
    "@xmath456880 we have detected h@xmath0 absorption in the @xmath60 kms@xmath37 ivc gas in 30 lines from rotational states @xmath23 to @xmath86 .",
    "some examples for the h@xmath0 absorption profiles are shown in fig.2 . the total h@xmath0 column density in the ivc is log @xmath16(h@xmath87 together with a very low @xmath39 value of @xmath88 kms@xmath37 .",
    "the low @xmath39 value implies that the h@xmath0 absorbing gas resides in a very confined region with a low velocity dispersion .",
    "the presence of h@xmath0 in this cloud is surprising , given the fact that the measured oi column density implies a rather low neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath16(hi@xmath89 @xmath68 .",
    "this value is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath90 @xmath68 from parkes 21 cm emission observations , although beam smearing effects may apply .",
    "despite the fact that the hi column density is low , the fraction of hydrogen in molecular form , @xmath65 , is as high as @xmath91 .",
    "such a relatively high molecular fraction at this low total gas column density is unusual considering previous measurements of h@xmath0 absorption in the milky way disk ( e.g. , savage et al.1977 ) . if the h@xmath0 gas stays in a formation - dissociation equilibrium ( equation ( 1 ) ) and",
    "if h@xmath0 self - shielding applies , the measured values for @xmath16(hi ) and @xmath16(h@xmath0 ) suggest that the molecular gas resides in a small , dense gaseous filament at a volume density of @xmath92 @xmath3 and a linear diameter of only @xmath93 cm or @xmath94 au .",
    "possibly , this filament corresponds to a tiny - scale atomic structure ( tsas ; heiles 1997 ) .",
    "such au scale gaseous structures have been found in the milky way disk using hi 21 cm absorption line measurements ( e.g. , faison et al.1998 ) .",
    "the analysis of the h@xmath0 rotational excitation for @xmath23 and @xmath24 yields a kinetic gas temperature of only @xmath95 k ( see fig.3 ) . this temperature is lower than what is found on average in local h@xmath0 gas in the disk ( @xmath96 k ; savage et al.1977 ) .",
    "the thermal pressure in this cloud then can be derived from our estimates of @xmath11 and @xmath97 and comes out to be @xmath98 @xmath3 k , about @xmath99 times higher than the standard thermal pressure in the cnm in the disk .",
    "it is not yet clear how tsas with such overpressures can form and survive in the otherwise very diffuse galactic halo gas , and more data is required to investigate the physical properties of these objects in more detail .",
    "unfortunately , the line of sight towards sk @xmath456880 so far remains the only one that shows an h@xmath0 absorbing structure in the the halo with such extreme properties .",
    "the lack of further h@xmath0 detections of tsas in the halo is not surprising , however . in view of their extremely small size",
    ", such structures should have a very low area filling factor .",
    "thus , the chance to find a tsas in front of a uv background source is very low .",
    "our study of diffuse molecular hydrogen absorption in galactic ivcs and hvcs has unveiled the presence of sub - pc / au scale gaseous structures in the milky way s extra - planar ism .",
    "most of the h@xmath0 absorption in the ivcs in the lower galactic halo appears to be associated with the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) at temperatures of @xmath100 k , volume densities of @xmath2 @xmath3 , and linear diameters of @xmath83 pc .",
    "the cnm in ivcs has a relatively large area filling factor and thus must represent a gas phase that is characteristic for the denser , neutral regions in the halo .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0 absorption in an ivc towards the lmc star sk @xmath456880 has shown that even smaller filaments at au scale and with very high densities ( almost @xmath101 @xmath3 ) exist in the halo , possibly representing tiny - scale atomic structures ( tsas ) .",
    "this finding implies that the milky way s extra - planar gas consists of extreme small - scale structure .",
    "many aspects that concern the physical nature of these filaments ( e.g. , formation processes , thermal pressures , dust content , etc . ) are not well understood yet , and more data is required to explore these intriguing objects in more detail ."
