    "in the last few decades , generalizations of dynamical systems using fractional derivatives instead of classical integer - order derivatives have proved to be more accurate in the mathematical modeling of real world phenomena arising from several interdisciplinary areas .",
    "it is now well - understood that fractional derivatives provide a good tool for the description of memory and hereditary properties of various processes , fractional - order systems being characterized by infinite memory .",
    "phenomenological description of viscoelastic liquids @xcite , colored noise @xcite , diffusion and wave propagation @xcite , boundary layer effects in ducts @xcite , fractional kinetics @xcite , electromagnetic waves @xcite , electrode - electrolyte polarization @xcite , represent just a few of the many application areas of fractional derivatives .",
    "it is important to emphasize that many qualitative properties of integer - order dynamical systems can not be extended by simple generalizations to fractional - order dynamical systems , and hence , the analysis of fractional - order dynamical systems is a very important field of research .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite that the fractional - order derivative ( of caputo , grunwald - letnikov or riemann - liouville type ) of a non - constant periodic function can not be a periodic function of the same period , while the integer - order derivative of a periodic function is indeed a periodic function of the same period . as a consequence",
    ", exact periodic solutions do not exist in a wide class of fractional - order dynamical systems .",
    "in fact , many fractional - order analogues of important theoretical results from the classical integer - order dynamical systems theory are still open questions ( such as the hopf bifurcation theorem for fractional - order systems or the stability analysis of time - delayed fractional - order systems @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the theoretical analysis of fractional - order models arising from different real world problems has to be done with care .    in fractional - order neural network models ,",
    "the common capacitor from the continuous - time integer - order recurrent neural networks is replaced by a generalized capacitor , called fractance @xcite . in many engineering applications ,",
    "there is a need for lossy capacitors with prescribed losses , in order to accomplish analog fractional calculus operations within a single device .",
    "a review of circuit theory approaches aimed at creating fractional - order capacitors ( fractance devices ) has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the fractional - order formulation of artificial neural network models is also justified by research results concerning biological neurons .",
    "for example , @xcite concluded that fractional differentiation provides neurons with a fundamental and general computation ability that can contribute to efficient information processing , stimulus anticipation and frequency - independent phase shifts of oscillatory neuronal firing .",
    "the results reported by @xcite suggest that the resulting net output of motor and premotor neurons can be described as fractional differentiation relative to eye position .",
    "fractional - order real - valued artificial neural networks have been in the spotlight since the year 2000 , starting with the pioneering works of @xcite , which mainly report on results of numerical simulations , especially on the numerical evidence of limit cycles and chaotic phenomena .",
    "several early papers also discuss chaotic synchronization in fractional - order neural networks @xcite .",
    "the first papers devoted to the theoretical stability analysis and hopf bifurcations of fractional - order neural networks of hopfield type @xcite also describe potential routes towards the onset of chaotic behavior when the fractional order of the system increases .",
    "the numerical examples presented in these papers unveiled highly complex dynamical behavior in real - valued fractional - order neural networks , such as the co - existence of strange attractors with several asymptotically stable steady states and limit cycles .",
    "moreover , in the last five years , a large number of papers have been published in this field , focusing on theoretical topics such as global mittag - leffler stability and synchronization @xcite , undamped oscillations generated by hopf bifurcations @xcite , dynamics of delayed fractional - order neural networks @xcite , etc .    however , since many interesting applications of neural networks involve complex signals , such as pattern recognition and classification , intelligent image processing , nonlinear filtering , brain - computer interfaces , time series prediction , robotics and bioinformatics , the investigation of complex - valued neural networks ( cvnns ) is an essential extension of the analysis of real - valued neural networks .",
    "several important research directions have arisen concerning cvnns , such as : the formal generalization of commonly used algorithms to the complex - valued case , the use of original complex - valued activation functions that can increase significantly the neuron and network functionality and the development of quaternion neurons and neural networks @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge , there are only a few research papers dedicated to the investigation of fractional - order complex - valued neural networks , published very recently .",
    "sufficient conditions for finite - time stability @xcite , uniform asymptotic stability @xcite , @xmath0-stability and global asymptotical periodicity @xcite have been obtain for fractional - order complex - valued neural networks with time - delays . in @xcite ,",
    "linearization techniques have been used to obtain sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium states of fractional - order complex - valued neural networks with time - delays .",
    "necessary conditions for the synchronization of fractional - order complex - valued neural networks with time delays has been recently obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , to the best of our knowledge , at this moment , there are no known results concerning hopf bifurcations in fractional - order complex - valued neural networks , and therefore , this constitutes one of the aims of this paper .",
    "moreover , this paper is devoted to the theoretical stability analysis of fractional - order complex - valued neural networks of hopfield type , extending the results presented by @xcite for fractional - order real - valued neural networks .",
    "two special connectivity types will be discussed in detail : networks with hub and ring structures , respectively .",
    "these simplified connectivity structures are studied to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of recurrent networks with more complicated connectivity .",
    "studying patterns of interconnections , called `` network motifs '' @xcite , occurring in neural networks is fundamental to understanding the dynamic behavior of the whole network .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , a few preliminaries are included about fractional - order differential systems , while in section 3 , a basic results are described regarding complex - valued fractional - order neural networks of hopfield type . in section 4 , a detailed stability and hopf bifurcation analysis is undertaken for fractional - order hopfield neural networks , concentrating on the two previously mentioned connectivity structures ( hub and ring ) . in each case , numerical examples are also presented .",
    "concluding remarks are included in section 5 .",
    "the fractional derivate employed in this paper is the caputo derivative , which is widely considered more applicable to real world problems , as it only requires initial conditions given in terms of integer - order derivatives , representing well - understood features of physical situations @xcite .    for a continuous function @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , the caputo fractional - order derivative of order @xmath3 of @xmath1",
    "is defined by @xmath4 where the gamma function is defined , as usual , as : @xmath5    remarkable scientific books which provide the main theoretical tools for the qualitative analysis of fractional - order dynamical systems , and at the same time , show the interconnection as well as the contrast between classical differential equations and fractional differential equations , are the works of @xcite .",
    "the following stability result holds for linear autonomous fractional - order systems :    [ thm.linear.stab ] the linear autonomous system @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath3 is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the spectrum of the matrix @xmath10 ( i.e. the set of all eigenvalues ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote respectively , the real and imaginary part of @xmath13 .    [ rem.real.comp ]",
    "the null solution of the integer order system @xmath14 is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath15 for any @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that inequality ( [ ineq.lambda ] ) is satisfied for any @xmath17 with @xmath15 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the condition for the asymptotic stability of the null solution of a linear integer - order system is more strict than the corresponding condition from the fractional - order case .",
    "a real - valued fractional - order neural network model of hopfield type ( fhnn ) with caputo - type derivatives , introduced by @xcite , is represented by the following system @xmath18where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the self - regulating parameters of the neurons , @xmath21 is the interconnection matrix , @xmath22 are the neuron input - output activation functions and @xmath23 denote the external inputs .    in this paper , we generalize the previously considered model ( [ frac.hop ] ) , introducing the following complex - valued neural network model with caputo fractional - order derivatives , described by the following system : @xmath24where @xmath25 are the complex state variables , @xmath20 are the self - regulating parameters of the neurons , @xmath26 , is the complex interconnection matrix , @xmath27 are complex - valued activation functions and @xmath28 represent the complex external inputs .",
    "several types of activation functions which are often used in complex - valued neural networks are described by @xcite . in particular , @xcite describe the properties of the following complex activation function @xmath29 which proves to be useful in many practical applications .    denoting @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the system ( frac.hop.comp )",
    "can be written in the following vector form : @xmath34    considering the real and the imaginary parts of the complex state vector , interconnection matrix , input vector and activation functions respectively , we denote @xmath35    with the above notations , system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) becomes @xmath36 which is equivalent to the following real - valued fractional - order system : @xmath37denoting @xmath38 the n - dimensional complex system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) is then equivalent to the @xmath39-dimensional fractional - order real - valued system @xmath40 it has to be emphasized that system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vect.2n ] ) is equivalent to a real - valued bidirectional associative memory ( bam ) network if and only if @xmath41 i.e. , the real part of the complex activation function @xmath42 depends only on the imaginary part @xmath43 of the state variable , and the imaginary part of the of @xmath42 depends only on the real part @xmath44 of the state variable .",
    "in the following , let us consider @xmath45 an equilibrium state of the complex - valued fractional - order neural network ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) : @xmath46 equivalently , @xmath47 is a steady state of the real system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vect.2n ] ) , i.e. a solution of @xmath48 obviously , @xmath49 is a steady state of the system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) with the fractional order @xmath19 if and only if it is an equilibrium state of the corresponding integer order system ( i.e. for @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore , the same results hold for the existence , uniqueness or multiplicity of equilibrium states of fractional - order neural networks , as in the case of integer - order neural networks . however , the conditions for the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium state @xmath49 are in general more strict in the case of the corresponding integer - order system .    with the aim of studying the stability of the equilibrium state @xmath51 in the framework of the fractional - order system ( frac.hop.comp.vec ) , or equivalently , the stability of the equilibrium state @xmath52 of system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vect.2n ] ) , we rely on the linearization theorem recently proved by @xcite .",
    "this linearization theorem is an analogue of the classical hartman - grobman theorem for the case of integer - order dynamical systems . for a rigorous application of this linearization theorem",
    ", we have to require that the function @xmath53 is of class @xmath54 ( continuously differentiable ) on a neighborhood of the steady state @xmath55 . using the notations @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , for the complex activation functions ,",
    "this is equivalent to the following assumption : @xmath58    due to the fact that the activation functions @xmath59 are usually assumed to be bounded , we can not require them to be holomorphic on the whole complex plane @xmath60 ( i.e. entire functions ) .",
    "the reason is that , according to liouville s theorem , every bounded entire function must be constant .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we only assume the following : @xmath61 hence , the cauchy - riemann conditions are satisfied : @xmath62    based on the previous assumptions and the hartman - grobman - type linearization theorem @xcite , the asymptotic stability of the steady state @xmath63 of the fractional - order system ( frac.hop.comp.vect.2n ) is determined by the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath64where @xmath65is a block matrix obtained using conditions ( [ cr.cond ] ) : @xmath66furthermore , the jacobian matrix becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 are real diagonal matrices .    in order to simplify the computations , we use the following notations @xmath71consequently , the jacobian matrix ( [ jacob1 ] ) becomes@xmath72    the characteristic polynomial of the jacobian matrix @xmath73 is@xmath74 consequently , the roots of the characteristic polynomial @xmath75 are either the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath76 , or the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath77 in the following , let us denote @xmath78 and @xmath79 the spectrum of @xmath80 . then , @xmath81 , so we only need to determine the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath80 .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath82where @xmath83 is the complex jacobian matrix of the function @xmath84 at the equilibrium state @xmath85 : @xmath86    based on the above reasoning and theorem [ thm.linear.stab ] , we conclude :    [ prop.complex.stab ] if assumptions @xmath87 and @xmath88 hold , the equilibrium state @xmath51 of system ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) is asymptotically stable if and only if all the eigenvalues of the complex - valued matrix @xmath89 satisfy @xmath90 .",
    "given that one of the aims of this paper is to study the stability of a given steady state with respect to the system parameters , we introduce the following definition :    the _ stability domain _ of a steady state @xmath49 with respect to the fractional - order neural network ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) is the set @xmath91 of system parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 for which @xmath85 is an asymptotically stable steady state of ( [ frac.hop.comp.vec ] ) .    in the following section",
    ", the stability and bifurcation properties will be investigated in the case of a special network structure , called the hub structure .      in scale - free networks",
    "@xcite , some nodes , called `` hubs '' , have many more connections than other nodes .",
    "in fact , the network as a whole has a power - law distribution of the number of links connecting to a node ( at least asymptotically ) . in this type of networks ,",
    "the existence of hub structures is a common feature , playing a fundamental role in defining the connectivity of the scale - free networks and in characterizing their dynamical behavior .",
    "the dynamics of hubs for integer - order real - valued neural networks was studied by @xcite .",
    "real - valued fractional - order neural networks with hub structure have been investigated by @xcite in the non - delayed case and by @xcite in the delayed case .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the complex - valued fractional - order neural network of @xmath95 neurons with hub structure @xmath96where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 . here , the first neuron ( called the central neuron ) is the center of the hub , and all the other @xmath100 neurons ( called peripheral neurons ) are connected directly only to the central neuron and to themselves ( self - connections are present ) .",
