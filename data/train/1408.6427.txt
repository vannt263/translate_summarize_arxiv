    "is one of the most important factors that limit the capacity of wireless networks . because characterizing the exact capacity region of interference channels is quite complicated ,",
    "the degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) has emerged as a convenient metric to quantify the capacity limits of such channels .",
    "the dof correspond to the number of independent interference - free signaling dimensions , and have been characterized for many multiuser network settings .    recently , _ interference alignment _ ( ia ) has been shown to achieve the dof of various wireless networks @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite , cadambe _ et al . _",
    "have shown that ia can achieve the @xmath3 dof of the @xmath0-user interference channel .",
    "however , the ia schemes presented therein require global channel state information to be known at the transmitters ( csit ) , which is not always possible in practical systems .",
    "stemming from this point , many research efforts have been dedicated to develop  _ blind interference alignment \" _ ( bia ) techniques that can be applied without csit . in @xcite",
    ", jafar has shown that bia can be applied if the channel temporal correlation structure follows specific patterns .",
    "such patterns were created artificially using reconfigurable antennas in @xcite for the broadcast channel ( bc ) . however",
    ", the channel temporal correlation structure that achieves the dof of the @xmath0-user interference channel can not arise in nature @xcite , and can not be created using reconfigurable antennas @xcite .",
    "recently in @xcite , wang presented the first characterization for the sum dof when using bia over the 3-user interference channel .",
    "it was shown that bia can achieve a sum dof of @xmath4 , which is greater than the unity sum dof achieved by naive orthogonal schemes .",
    "besides , it was also shown that @xmath4 is the upper bound on the dof achieved by linear bia schemes .",
    "however , this result is specific for the 3-user channel , and the dof of the generic @xmath0-user interference channel with bia remains an open issue . in this work",
    ", we extend the analysis in @xcite , and show that when using bia with staggered antenna switching over a @xmath0-user interference channel , a sum dof of @xmath1 is achievable .",
    "a key insight behind this result is that any signal vector can be aligned with interference at @xmath5 unintended receivers , which corresponds to the alignment scheme considered in this paper .",
    "such result suggests that bia can achieve double the rate achieved by orthogonal schemes for large @xmath0 .",
    "this result is novel as it is the first characterization for the dof of the @xmath0-user interference channel with bia .",
    "moreover , we propose a systematic algorithm for generating the transmit beamforming vectors and the receive antennas switching patterns in order to achieve the @xmath1 dof . finally , we apply this algorithm to the 4-user siso interference channel showing that @xmath2 sum dof are achievable almost surely .",
    "it is worth mentioning that several works have characterized the dof of the interference channel with delayed csit .",
    "for example , in @xcite , it was shown that the dof of the @xmath0-user interference channel with ia and outdated csit approach the limiting value @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "also , the sum dof of two ergodic ia techniques with delayed csit presented in @xcite was shown to be @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note here that our work departs from these works as bia does not require any csit .",
    "other bia schemes , such as the relay - assisted scheme in @xcite , requires the presence of several relays between transmitters and receivers , which may not be the case in many practical scenarios .",
    "contrarily , bia using staggered antenna switching only requires the usage of reconfigurable antennas at the receivers , which does not entail significant hardware complexity as reconfigurable antennas use a single rf chain @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the system model .",
    "next , in section iii , we derive the sum dof of the @xmath0-user siso interference channel with bia using staggered antenna switching at the receiver . a systematic algorithm to generate the beamforming vectors and the antenna switching patterns",
    "is presented in section iv .",
    "this algorithm is applied for the 4-user siso interference channel , and we show that @xmath2 sum dof is achievable . finally , we draw our conclusion in section v.",
    "we consider a fully connected @xmath0-user siso interference channel where each transmitter is equipped with one conventional antenna , and each receiver is equipped with a reconfigurable ( multi - mode ) antenna that can switch among @xmath8 distinct modes .",

    "we assume an antenna with @xmath8 possible modes , thus @xmath21 is the selected antenna mode at the @xmath16 channel use .",
    "each mode corresponds to a distinct channel realization , which means that at the @xmath16 channel use , the channel between the @xmath14 transmitter and the @xmath9 receiver belongs to the set @xmath22 , depending on the switching pattern @xmath20 .",

    "given that all channel matrices @xmath50 , @xmath51 , have the same changing pattern dictated by the predefined antenna mode switching pattern at receiver @xmath52 , we directly apply lemma 2 in @xcite to ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) to obtain @xmath53 } \\in \\mbox{span}({\\bf v}^{[k]}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath54 . now , consider receiver @xmath44 . from ( [ 4 ] ) we have @xmath55 } \\in   \\mbox{span}({\\bf h}_{l+1,k } { \\bf v}^{[k]})$ ] , which can be written as @xmath56 } \\in \\mbox{span}({\\bf h}_{l+1,l+1 } { \\bf h}^{-1}_{l+1,l+1 } { \\bf h}_{l+1,k } { \\bf v}^{[k]}).\\ ] ] thus , we have @xmath33 } \\in \\mbox{span}({\\bf h}^{-1}_{l+1,l+1 } { \\bf h}_{l+1,k } { \\bf v}^{[k]})$ ] , @xmath57",

    ", they occupy @xmath73 dimensions . in addition",
    ", the interfering signals from every set of @xmath39 interfering transmitters @xmath74 overlap in @xmath65 dimensions .",
    "because the total number of dimensions is equal to the number of channel uses @xmath10 , we have @xmath75 by summing the inequality in ( [ 11 ] ) over @xmath72 , we have @xmath76 where the factor @xmath38 arises from the fact that each dimension @xmath77 aligns at @xmath38 receivers .",

    "thus , for a large number of users , the achievable sum dof of bia in the @xmath0-user interference channel approaches @xmath91 .",
    "this means that the best we can do using the proposed scheme when the csit is not available is to offer double the dof achievable by orthogonal multiple access schemes .",
    "note that unlike theorem 7 in @xcite , which assumes a very specific channel coherence structure , our result holds for any ( general ) coherence structure . in the following section , we propose an algorithm to systematically generate the antenna switching patterns and the beamforming vectors such that the @xmath1 sum dof is achieved .",

    "such assumptions have important hardware implications .",
    "for instance , the proposed algorithm operates with low cost reconfigurable antennas that have only two modes .",
    "besides , beamforming is very simple and applied by activating or deactivating certain symbols at the transmitter .",
    "the idea behind the algorithm and the insights based on which it was constructed can be found in the proof of theorem 2 .    in order to achieve the dof presented in theorem 1",
    ", we need to satisfy the bounds in ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the bound in ( [ 10 ] ) is achieved if every dimension transmitted by user @xmath31 aligns with some other dimension from another user .",
    "thus , each user needs to send @xmath94 symbols per @xmath10 channel uses .",
    "moreover , the bound in ( [ 13 ] ) is satisfied if we use the minimal number of channel uses that keeps the desired signals and the interference linearly independent .",

    ", we prove that the proposed scheme achieves the @xmath1 sum dof .",
    "_ applying bia using the switching patterns and beamforming vectors generated by the algorithm in section iv - a , the sum dof of @xmath1 is achieved almost surely for any @xmath0 . _    we focus on an arbitrary receiver @xmath52 . from ( [ 1 ] ) , we know that the received signal at such receiver is given by @xmath123 .",
    "based on the algorithm in section iv - a , we know that each transmitter sends @xmath94 symbols over @xmath124 channel uses . given the antenna switching patterns matrix @xmath125 and the beamforming vectors for all transmitters , we need to prove the following :    1 .   at receiver @xmath52",
    ", the signal space does not collapse , i.e. , all desired signal vectors are independent .",

    "3 .   the interference space and the desired signal space do not intersect , i.e. ,",
    "all desired signal vectors are independent to all interfering signal vectors .",
    "condition ( 1 ) implies that the @xmath94 desired signal vectors must reside in @xmath94 independent dimensions .",
    "since the total number of dimensions is equal to the number of channel uses @xmath95 , then condition ( 2 ) follows , i.e. , the interference should reside in the remaining @xmath127 dimensions .",
    "condition ( 3 ) implies that no interference vector aligns with any signal vector .",
    "if all these conditions are satisfied , then the dof of a user @xmath52 is the ratio between the number of its interference - free signal dimensions to the total channel uses , i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the sum dof for all users is @xmath1 , which is the achievable dof stated in theorem 1 .",
    "we start by proving condition ( 1 ) . from lemma 1 , we know that all the distinct beamforming vectors @xmath129}_{k}$ ] , @xmath130 are linearly independent , which means that the signal space will not collapse as it resides in @xmath94 dimensions .",
    "thus , condition ( 1 ) is satisfied .",
