    "the formation , behavior , and evolution of o stars influence many aspects of the interstellar medium in the galaxy .",
    "o stars play a central role in the evolution of galactic abundances , influence the structure of the interstellar medium through supernova explosions , ionization , and mass - loss , and determine the appearance of the spiral arms in the visible and the radio through both thermal and non  thermal emission . the pre ",
    "main sequence evolution of luminous o stars takes place while they are still shrouded within their natal clouds .",
    "therefore , we usually study the surrounding h  ii regions and dust clouds , rather than the stars themselves , and carry out these studies at far - ir and radio wavelengths .    much of the gas in the h  ii regions that surround newly formed o stars is involved in supersonic motions of the order of 20 , usually ascribed to `` turbulence '' .",
    "the smallest and presumably youngest h  ii regions ( ultracompact , or uc h  ii regions ) typically have linewidths of 2535  in high frequency centimeter wave recombination lines ( rrl s , garay 1989 , churchwell et al .",
    "1989 , afflerbach et al .",
    "there is considerable observational evidence for even higher velocity motions of various sorts .",
    "massive o stars have winds with terminal velocities of 12@xmath110@xmath2 km s@xmath3 and mass loss rates of up to a few 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 per year ( chlebowski & garmany 1991 ) .",
    "many high luminosity and presumably young stars embedded deep within molecular clouds show evidence for ionized circumstellar envelopes or for winds with terminal velocities @xmath6200  ( simon et al . 1981 , 1983 , persson et al .",
    "1984 , garden & geballe 1986 , bunn , hoare , & drew 1995 ) . in some more evolved and optically accessible h  ii regions , there are small amounts of gas moving at 100 - 200  with respect to the bulk velocity of the h  ii region ( meaburn & walsh 1981 , 1986 ) .",
    "there is increasing evidence that a ( substantial ) minority of ultracompact h  ii regions emit broad radio recombination lines .",
    "( in this paper , we refer to these sources as broad recombination line objects , brlos ) .",
    "the presence of this rrl component implies that the regions contain gas moving at velocities up to @xmath760 from the rest velocity of the cloud ( altenhoff , strittmatter , & wendker 1981 , zijlstra et al .",
    "1990 , gaume , fey , & claussen 1994 , de pree et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) . in the uc h  ii regions ,",
    "unlike the more evolved h  ii regions , the high velocity gas may account for a significant fraction of the total emission measure .",
    "if high velocity emission arises in the very compact parts of the uc h  ii region complexes where the emission measures are high , the gas may only become detectable in observations at the shortest centimeter wavelengths where these compact sources begin to become optically thin and where non - lte effects become negligible .",
    "observations at shorter wavelengths could therefore provide a better way to search for the broad features .",
    "we have investigated the incidence and nature of the broad recombination line features by surveying a sample of bright uc h  ii regions in 3 , 2 , and 1.3 mm recombination lines .",
    "this paper presents results and analysis of this survey and a discussion of the origin of the broad line emission .",
    "we made all the observations we present here with the iram 30 meter telescope at pico de veleta ( spain ) .",
    "the first set of observations took place in 1992 february and the second set in 1993 march . on the fist observing run ,",
    "we observed three recombination lines simultaneously at wavelengths of 3 , 2 and 1.3  mm , and on the second run , we observed several combinations of two such lines ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the telescope beam at these wavelengths was , respectively , 24 , 17 and 11 arc seconds .",
    "table 1 lists the sources , source positions , dates of observations , and observed transitions .",
    "the receivers were sis mixers , tuned to single sideband ( image rejections between 7 and 10 db ) , with typical system noise temperatures of 250 , 350 and 650 k at 3 , 2 and 1.3 mm .",
    "we used two 512 channel filterbanks with 1 mhz resolution and a 430 channel acousto - optical spectrometer with a resolution of 1.1 mhz as spectrometric backends . in order to insure good baseline subtraction",
    ", we nutated the telescope subreflector at 0.25 hz between the source and a reference position 240 arc seconds away . while some of the sources have extended radio continuum emission , published maps at centimeter wavelengths show that an angular displacement of this size should result in contamination of the reference beam by narrow recombination line emission at only a very low level .",
    "under good weather conditions , use of the nutating subreflector allows one to measure the line and continuum emission simultaneously .",
    "the weather conditions during the 1993 observations were good enough to permit us to measure the continuum emission at 3  mm .",
    "we calibrated the data by observing the atmosphere and cold and hot loads at known temperatures .",
    "all the intensities are in units of antenna temperature corrected for forward scattering and spillover as well as for atmospheric transmission , t@xmath8 , and the conversion factor from antenna temperature to flux density at 3  mm is 6 jy / k .",
    "almost all of the ultracompact h  ii regions studied as part of the present work lie close to or within dense , high column density molecular cores .",
    "these cores produce very rich millimeter wave line spectra .",
    "confusion from these molecular line emitters within the beam is an important limiting factor when deriving quantitative results from the millimeter recombination line data .",
    "the presence of the molecular lines does not , however , impede our ability to _ detect _ high velocity recombination line emission .",
    "the molecular lines are , in general , quite narrow ( 58 km s@xmath3 ) and the broad components of adjacent @xmath9n=1 recombination transitions with similar n should be similar in strength and shape but overlap with completely different sets of molecular features .",
    "table [ tab2 ] presents the best fits of one or two gaussians to profiles of selected lines in each source in our survey . in all cases ,",
    "the lines selected from among the 1.33  mm hn@xmath10 transitions observed ( table [ tab1 ] ) are the 3  mm transitions , h39@xmath10 and h41@xmath10 . since our observed positions coincide with or lie close to hot , dense , high column density molecular cores ( cf .",
    "plume , jaffe , & evans 1992 , plume et al .",
    "1997 ) , the high density of molecular features at 2  mm and 1.3  mm makes the hydrogen recombination lines in these bands more prone to confusion .",
    "the 3  mm continuum flux densities measured toward the positions given in table [ tab1 ] also appear in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "table [ tab2 ] gives the electron temperatures , derived from the ratio of the total integrated h41@xmath10 line intensity ( including both line components if more than one is present ) to the measured continuum adjacent to this 3  mm line , assuming lte conditions .",
    "it is interesting to note that failure to notice the presence of a relatively weak broad component in recombination line spectra , a component which can be missed in observations with moderate sensitivity , can lead one to overestimate the electron temperatures derived from the line - to - continuum ratios .",
    "the lte electron temperatures we derive from our data all lie within @xmath730 % of the canonical 10,000 k temperature of h  ii regions .",
    "the millimeter recombination line shapes for four of the seven sources in our sample ( ngc 7538 , w49n , g34.3 + 0.2 , and s106 ) deviate substantially from the simple 2535 wide gaussian profiles that are typical of ultracompact h  ii regions .",
    "fits of single gaussians to these profiles left systematic residuals at @xmath1120  from the line center . in all cases , we significantly reduce the residuals when we fit the observed spectra with two gaussian profiles , one with the normal uc h  ii region recombination line width and another broad component which is 23 times wider .",
    "we present here our analysis of these four sources .    toward most of the sources in our sample ,",
    "the 30  m beam contains very complex radio continuum structure that contributes to both the normal and the broad spectral components .",
    "so far , there are no maps of recombination lines at millimeter wavelengths with sufficient angular resolution and sensitivity to identify the sources responsible for the broad features .",
    "to identify the sources giving rise to these features , we combine our millimeter recombination line data with existing high angular resolution maps of continuum and recombination line emission , mainly observed at centimeter wavelengths . to aid in comparisons with these maps",
    ", we estimate the amount of continuum emission `` required '' to produce each line component by assuming that the observed 3  mm line and continuum emission is optically thin and that the millimeter recombination lines arise from gas where the electron temperature equals the temperature derived from the total line and continuum emission ( under the assumption of lte conditions ) from each source ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "table [ tab2 ] gives our estimate of the continuum associated with the broad and the normal components based on these assumptions .",
    "the gas that produces the broad line component accounts for 35%70% of the 3 mm continuum flux and therefore at least that fraction of the emission measure in these four objects .",
    "we have observed six millimeter wave hydrogen recombination lines toward ngc 7538 .",
    "our beam center lies at the position of the infrared source and double radio continuum source ngc 7538 irs1 ( campbell 1984 )",
    ". a free fit of a single gaussian profile to the h41@xmath10 line underestimated the brightness both at the peak of the line and at high velocities .",
    "the left panel of figure [ n7538comp ] shows the results of a fit which we forced to match the area around the peak by minimizing the least squares deviation between a single gaussian profile and the observed line over a range of @xmath715  about the peak of the line .",
    "the lower part of the left panel shows that , while this profile accounts well for the inner part of the observed line , there are substantial residuals to this fit , in particular at higher velocity .",
    "the right panels of figure [ n7538comp ] show a fit of two gaussians to the same profile and the residuals resulting from this fit .",
    "the line parameters we derive in an independent fit of two gaussians to the h39@xmath10 line agree well with the h41@xmath10 results ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "for both hydrogen lines , the normal line has a width of around 25 while the broad component has a width of 70 .",
    "high resolution 1.3 cm recombination line observations toward ngc 7538 irs1 ( gaume et al . 1995 ) reveal extremely broad emission ( full width to zero power of around 200  in the northern and southern hypercompact lobes and an absence of line emission in between the lobes .",
    "the discrepancies between the linewidths of the centimeter and millimeter wavelength recombination lines are similar to those found in mwc  349 .",
    "as in this latter source , the broad h66@xmath10 lines in ngc  7538  irs1 , which show noticeable non - gaussian profiles with flat  topped shapes , are very likely affected by non - lte excitation ( see martin - pintado et al 1993 ) . for ngc 7538 , our beam contains the sources irs1 , irs2 and irs3 and the total continuum flux density at 3  mm is in good agreement with the fluxes derived by akabane et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from interferometric measurements .",
    "the 3@xmath12 resolution 3  mm continuum map ( akabane et al . 1992 ) shows that irs3 makes a negligible contribution to the millimeter wave continuum flux , irs2 contributes 1 jy , and irs1 contributes 1.6 jy . the values for the continuum fluxes for the two latter sources are consistent with an attribution of the normal spectral component to irs2 and the broad component to irs1 , the same sense in which the origin of the normal and very broad 6 cm recombination line emission is directly attributable to the respective sources ( gaume et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we observed six millimeter wave hydrogen recombination lines toward this source ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "our beam center lies toward the h@xmath13o maser center , about 1  north of the ultracompact 15 ghz continuum source g1 ( dreher et al .",
    "the upper left panel of figure [ w49n ] shows a single gaussian fit to the h41@xmath10 line made following the procedure described for the single gaussian fit to the ngc 7538 profile .",
    "the residuals to this fit ( lower left ) show a systematic excess in the wings of the line .",
    "the upper right panel of figure [ w49n ] shows a two gaussian fit to the same line .",
    "the minimization results in a component with a velocity width of 31  and a second component 71  wide . over the velocity interval occupied by the hydrogen line ,",
    "the residuals to the two gaussian fit at the central position are flat .",
    "we also fit two gaussians to the he41@xmath10 line at this position . we allowed the temperatures of the two components to vary but fixed the widths of the two he components at the values of the h41@xmath10 widths and the velocity offset from the corresponding h41@xmath10 components at 122.2 .",
    "this fit ( figure [ w49n ] ( lower right ) ) shows that a normal plus a broad component can account for the shape of the helium line as well .",
    "the strengths of the normal and broad he components are respectively 9% and 8% of the strengths of the corresponding hydrogen emission components .",
    "a five point map of the h41@xmath10 transition at 12@xmath12 intervals is consistent with an unresolved source as the origin of both the normal and the broad component .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ w49compadd ] superposes spectra of h39@xmath10 and h41@xmath10 toward w49n .",
    "the wings of the two recombination lines match very closely , but the shapes of the inner portions of the lines differ considerably .",
    "a triple gaussian fit to the h39@xmath10 spectrum fixing the velocities and widths of the two broader components to match the values derived from the h41@xmath10 spectrum shows that there is a third feature with a full width to half maximum of 13.3 .",
    "this narrower feature has a width similar to the width of molecular lines in this source ( serabyn , guesten & schulz 1993 ) .",
    "the third line has an observed velocity of 7.5   with respect to the h39@xmath10 frequency .",
    "the only molecular transition with a rest frequency close to that of the h39@xmath10 line ( 106737.365 mhz ) is the @xmath14 transition of @xmath15so ( @xmath16=106743.365 mhz ) .",
    "for this line , the observed velocity corresponds to v@xmath17= 6.6  in its own frame .",
    "this velocity is close to the typical molecular velocity of the w49 core .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ w49compadd ] shows an overlay of the observed h39@xmath10 and h41@xmath10 profiles where we have added the fitted @xmath15so feature to the h41@xmath10 data to illustrate the similarity of the shapes of the recombination line profiles themselves .    there is some evidence for high velocity recombination line emission in previous millimeter observations of w49n .",
    "the wings seen in figure [ w49n ] are also apparent to the trained eye in the h40@xmath10 spectrum in figure 3 of gordon ( 1989 ) .",
    "high angular resolution observations of the h66@xmath10 and h52@xmath10 transitions at 1.3  cm and 0.7  cm , respectively ( de pree , mehringer , & goss 1997 ) , show that sources a and b , both of which lie within our beam , produce lines with a full width to half maximum of 50 - 60 .",
    "since the line fills the spectrometer band for these sources , however , the observations do not exclude the presence of higher velocity emission consistent with our millimeter measurements .",
    "determining the source or sources in w49n responsible for the broad line emission is complex because of the large number of continuum sources in our beam .",
    "the h41@xmath10 beam contains the sources a ",
    ". we can use high angular resolution maps of the rrl and continuum emission ( de pree et al .",
    "1997 ) to establish which source may be responsible for the broad component . as previously mentioned , sources a and b have the broadest h66@xmath10 and h52@xmath10 profiles .",
    "these two sources have power law radio continuum spectra with spectral indexes of 0.6 and 0.9 , respectively . extrapolating to 3 mm , a and b",
    "would each contribute around 2 jy .",
    "given the 3 jy required to provide the source of the broad line emission ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , these two stellar wind sources are viable candidates for the origin of the broad lines .",
    "however , source a is located at the edge of the beam and the map of the h39@xmath10 line indicates a point source located closer to b than to a. like in ngc 7538 irs1 , the broad component seems to be associated with compact sources with rising continuum spectra .",
    "we observed six millimeter wave hydrogen recombination lines toward this source ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the center position for these observations lies about 3  south of the 15 ghz continuum peak ( garay , rodriguez , & van gorkom 1986 ) .",

    "the figure also shows the sum of two gaussians with parameters averaged between those from the h41@xmath10 and h39@xmath10 line fits .",
    "the compromise gaussians have widths of 32 and 75 .",
    "the shape of the two hydrogen lines agree well , except at velocities where narrow molecular lines from the hot core contaminate the profiles .    toward g34.3",
    "+ 0.2 , our 30  m beam at 3  mm contains three radio continuum sources .",
    "components a and b are compact objects with spectra that rise with frequency at least to 90 ghz ( gaume et al . 1994 ) .",
    "component c is a classic cometary hii region ( reid & ho 1985 ; garay et al .",
    "1986 ) . at centimeter wavelengths , where sources a and b are weak and opaque , all of the recombination line emission comes from source c. the 2  cm results ( garay et al .",
    "1986 ) indicate a relatively uniform line width of around 50  across source c. the more sensitive 3  cm data ( gaume et al .",
    "1994 ) show line widths which increase from 2545   in the north and west to about 80  in the southeast of component c ( gaume et al . 1994 ) .",
    "our total continuum emission measured at 3  mm is @xmath67 jy , in good agreement with the 6.6 jy we extrapolate from the 6 and 2  cm measurements of benson & johnston ( 1984 ) by assuming that source c is optically thin and ultracompact sources a and b are optically thick with spectral indexes of @xmath60.9 ( gaume at al .",
    "1994 ) . based on this extrapolation ,",
    "the compact sources a and b , despite their rising `` stellar wind '' spectra , can only account for 0.8 jy of the 7 jy flux density at 3  mm .",
    "both the broad and the narrow line component therefore should arise mainly from the cometary h  ii region . the radial velocities and widths of both the broad and narrow line components in the h41@xmath10 spectrum lie within the range of one or another centimeter rrl measurement toward the parts of source c that emit most of the flux ( garay et al .",
    "1986 , gaume et al .",
    "the results obtained by the centimeter rrl observers , however , are not consistent with each other .",
    "s106 is less luminous than the other brlos in our sample .",
    "we selected this source for investigation because of the numerous observations of broad near - ir hydrogen recombination lines toward s106  ir ( persson et al . 1984 , felli et al .",
    "1985 , garden & geballe 1986 , drew , bunn , & hoare 1993 ) .",
    "this ir source lies at the center of an obscuring dust disk ( eiroa , elsaesser , & lahulla 1979 ) and at the edge of our beam , 13@xmath12 northeast of the position listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "coincident with the ir source is a compact radio source with a spectrum rising as @xmath18 from 5 to 23 ghz ( snell & bally 1986 , felli et al .",
    "1985 ) . very high angular resolution 5 ghz observations show that this central source is elongated along the equator of the extended bipolar optical and radio nebula ( hoare et al .",
    "1994 , felli et al .",
    "there is a strong submillimeter dust continuum source close to the position we observed ( richer et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the difference between the observed position and the ir source position and the presence of relatively strong dust emission make modeling this source problematic .    for s106 , the broad component can not arise only from the compact continuum source with the rising spectrum since the extrapolation of the continuum spectrum of this source to 3  mm implies that it will only account for 42 mjy at this wavelength .",
    "therefore , the high - velocity recombination line emission is associated with the bipolar nebula . like",
    "g34.3 + 0.2 , this source appears to be more evolved than the uc hii regions in ngc  7538  irs1 and w49n .",

    "hasegawa & akabane ( 1984 ) have reported high velocity emission toward peak 1 in the h51@xmath10 line .",

    "three arc seconds north and south of this position , the width is only 35  but the velocity changes from -11  north of the peak to -42  to the south .",
    "brlos are common in uc h  ii region complexes .",
    "the lifetimes of these sources are much longer than their crossing times and the broad line emission phase must represent a substantial fraction of the lifetime of uc h  ii sources .",
    "one argument for the long duration of the broad line emission phase as a part of overall h  ii region evolution is the presence of broad millimeter and high frequency centimeter recombination lines toward ultracompact sources like ngc  7538  irs1 and mwc  349 and also toward more extended and presumably more evolved sources like k3 - 50 and s106 .",
    "it is possible that there is a connection between the dominant broad line emission at early evolutionary stages and the low - level emission at high velocities seen in very evolved hii regions ( meaburn & walsh 1981 , 1986 ) .",
    "the available sample of h  ii regions observed with high enough sensitivity to detect the broad recombination lines is small ( table [ tab3 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "our estimate of the fraction of compact h  ii regions with broad lines is somewhat uncertain and may suffer from selection biases .",
    "we follow two approaches in estimating the frequency of occurrence of these objects : we first determine the fraction of sources in uc h  ii region complex that show the broad lines , within each well - studied complex containing at least one brlo . in ngc 7538 ,",
    "one out of three sources is a brlo . in g34.3 + 0.2 one to three out of three is likely to be a brlo and in w49 , we find that two out of eight sources are probably responsible for the broad recombination line emission . from these data",
    ", we estimate that roughly around 30% of the compact sources in these complexes are brlos .    as a second approach",
    ", we use a limited sample of compact h  ii regions ( afflerbach et al . 1996 ) .",
    "since we are only interested in the statistical properties of the sample and since the signal to noise in the recombination line data from this survey is lower than for any of the observations of individual sources , we set a somewhat lower threshold for brlos and include objects with rrl widths @xmath045 . using this criterion , 6 of the 23 sources in the sample have lines broad enough to demonstrate the presence of one or more brlos which also implies a frequency of incidence of roughly 30% for brlos in their sample .",
    "table [ tab3 ] gives a summary of the main characteristics of all the well - studied brlos ( i.e. not including the statistical sample from the afflerbach et al .",
    "most of the sources are very compact , with typical crossing times of less than 2@xmath26 years for expansion velocities of around 50 .",
    "following the same line of argumentation used by wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) for all compact hii regions , we find that , for such short dynamical times , one would expect to detect only @xmath615 objects of this kind in the whole galaxy , close to the number of objects so far detected in just a few regions . the high detection rate for brlos means that these objects can not be expanding at the velocities measured by the recombination lines .",
    "most of the resolved brlos have a bipolar morphology and almost all brlos have rising continuum spectra up to at least 1.3 cm ( table [ tab3 ] ) . even for the most compact objects , the rising spectrum continues well into the millimeter wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of most of the regions and the presence of large column densities of dust makes it very difficult to measure the continuum spectral indexes at short millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths . for the best case , mwc  349 ,",
    "the @xmath23 continuum spectrum is observed up to 60 @xmath24 m ( harvey et al . 1979 ) .",
    "if other brlos share this characteristic , large emission measures lie hidden in the optically thick regions seen at centimeter wavelengths in most of the brlos in table 3 . as determined from the high - resolution vla maps , all the brlos have emission measures of at least 10@xmath27 pc cm@xmath4 and the number of the lyman continuum photons needed to explain the radio data varies from 10@xmath29 s@xmath3 for s106 to more than 10@xmath30 s@xmath3 for the other sources .",
    "for the sources with continuum spectra that rise into the millimeter wavelengths , these values are clearly lower limits and the emission measure and the number of lyman continuum photons increase with frequency at least with the same power law as the continuum spectrum .",
    "this indicates that the ionization of all the brlos , except for s106 , will require stars with spectral types earlier than o6 .",
    "the large emission measure indicates that the brlos must be ionized by a star or stars at the geometrical centers of the hii regions , within the optically thick cores observed at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "the central location of the ionizing stars is already apparent in mwc  349 and s106 where the geometry is clear because the ionizing stars are observed in the visible and the ir .",
    "the rising continuum spectral index of an opaque ionized source is a product of a combination of the radial density and temperature distributions of the ionized material .",
    "this index is nearly independent of the axial and azimuthal geometry ( schmid - burgk 1982 ) .",
    "the brlos mapped with the vla at high angular resolution show that the continuum and recombination line intensities are consistent with minor variations of the electron temperatures within the sources ( see e.g de pree et al . 1994 for k3 - 50 , gaume et al .",
    "1995 for ngc 7538 irs1 ; martin - pintado et al .",
    "1993 ) , suggesting that the hii regions are close to isothermal .",
    "furthermore , for the typical spectral indexes measured for the brlos , between 0.5 and 1.5 , the effects of moderate power law temperature gradients have minor effects ( @xmath620% ) on the continuum spectral indexes ; being independent of temperature gradients for spectral indexes of @xmath60.6 ( cassinelli & hartmann 1977 ) .",
    "therefore , we will consider that the spectral indexes given in table 3 are basically related to the density structure within the brlos .",
    "the density structure varies from n@xmath31r@xmath32 to n@xmath31r@xmath33 for spectral indexes between @xmath340.6 and 1.3 respectively ( olnon 1975 ; panagia & felli 1975 ; wright & barlow 1975 ) . for such steep density gradients ,",
    "the hii region is far from pressure equilibrium and the ionized material must be flowing away from the dense region near the star . from mass conservation",
    ", the density structures derived from the continuum spectral indexes , imply that only in a small fraction of brlos ( those with spectral indexes of @xmath6 0.6 ) is the ionized gas outflowing at constant velocity , and in most of the brlos the ionized gas is accelerating . in the most extreme case ( spectral indexes of 1.3 )",
    ", the velocity must be proportional to the radius .",
    "the measured linewidths of the brlos ( table [ tab2 ] ) fall within a remarkably small range .",
    "our best estimate for the completeness range for our data is @xmath9v(fwhm)=45100 .",
    "confusion with narrow line emission from the same complex imposes the lower bound .",
    "we estimate the upper bound from our observed spectra .",
    "the upper bound results from a combination of the diminuition of peak intensity with increased width and confusion with the helium lines and with low - level molecular line emission . from our own observations , however , the widths of the broad recombination line components cluster strongly around 75 . the results in table [ tab3 ] show that even sources observed at centimeter wavelengths with interferometers have broad recombination lines with widths very close to 75 .",
    "if further observations bear out this consistency in the velocity spread of the emission , the explanation of this result must form an important part of any theory of brlos .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize the various possible models for uc h  ii regions in the context of the our new data and other recently published data on broad recombination line emission .",
    "we note first that the brlos are the products of gas dynamics , rather than radiative transfer .",
    "rrl observers are conditioned to think about pressure broadening whenever they see broad line profiles or wide wings on the lines .",
    "we can rule out pressure broadening , however , as the source of the wide lines in brlos .",
    "the very strong dependence of the pressure broadened line width on principle quantum number , n ( @xmath9v@xmath31n@xmath35 ) means that , if pressure broadening produces the wide lines , their widths should change dramatically ( by factors of 5 - 400 ) over the range of n values observed for our brlos . in all cases for which there are observations of hn@xmath10 transitions over a range of n , the _ observed _ changes in the width and/or strength of the broad recombination line component are much smaller than those predicted by pressure broadening .",
    "champagne models ( tenorio - tagle 1979 , bodenheimer , tenorio - tagle , & yorke 1979 ) consider the evolution of young h  ii regions as they break out of the dense neutral cores in which they form into a lower density diffuse medium . during the breakout phase",
    ", the ionized gas accelerates into the low density medium at speeds up to 3050 .",
    "subsequent analysis shows that this kind of acceleration also occurs in h  ii regions that form in clouds with power law density distributions , if the density gradients are sufficiently steep ( franco , tenorio - tagle , & bodenheimer 1990 ) .",

    "hypersonic bipolar outflows of molecular gas are a common feature of protostellar sources , both in low mass star forming regions and in regions containing low and high mass pre main sequence objects ( bachiller 1996 ; plume et al .",
    "these outflows have velocities ranging from a few up to about 100",
    ". external ionization of molecular flows near o stars embedded in a young cluster could reproduce at least some of the features of brlos . alternatively ,",
    "if the turn - on time for the ionizing star is short enough and occurs soon enough after the outflow phase , the o star could ionize its own molecular flow from the inside .",
    "k3 - 50a is the only one of the broad line sources that is large enough ( 0.2@xmath11.2 pc ) to have a reasonably long crossing time ( @xmath62@xmath36 years ) . in principle , then , this source would be a good candidate for the ionization of a fossil flow .",
    "in such a picture , we would expect the ionizing photons to move through the cavity evacuated by a fast molecular wind and strike the swept - up material in the cavity walls .",

    "after a short time ( @xmath610@xmath37 years , shull 1980 , 1982 ) , the wind will create a bubble with a dense shell of swept - up material .",

    "stellar uv photons ionize material in the disk and produce steady mass loss for periods of up to 10@xmath38 years .",
    "these flows are inherently bipolar .",

    "most of the papers discuss the terminal velocity of this evaporated material but do not explicitly model it .",
    "kessel et al . ( 1998 ) present line profiles for optical transitions showing typical linewidths on the order of 40 km s@xmath3 .",
    "since the widespread existence of brlos was unknown at the time the various theoretical papers were published , the models do not explicitly address the issues raised by the nature of these sources .",

    "none of the models has an obvious explanation for the relatively narrow range in observed line widths .",
    "all but the last two models suffer from difficulties with the lifetime .",
    "they produce high velocity emission only for the order of a single crossing time and therefore can not account for the number and frequency of observed brlos .",

    "<S> we compare these objects to an additional seven similar sources we have found in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the broad recombination line objects ( brlos ) make up about 30% of all sources in complexes containing ultracompact h  ii regions . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of spectral line and continuum data implies that the brlos coincide with sources with rising spectral indices , @xmath00.4 up to 100 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> both the number of brlos and their frequency of occurrence within h  ii region complexes , when coupled with their small size and large internal motions , mean that the apparent contradiction between the dynamical and the population lifetimes for brlos is even more severe than for ultracompact h  ii regions as a whole . </S>",

    "<S> the lifetime , morphology , and rising spectral index of the sources argue for photoevaporated disks as the cause for brlos . </S>",
