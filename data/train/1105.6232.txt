    "astrophysical jets are highly collimated beams of high velocity material , observed in a variety of astronomical sources - among them young stellar objects ( yso ) , micro - quasars , or active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    ". somewhat less collimated beams of comparatively lower speed are usually called outflows .",
    "the current understanding of jet formation is that these outflows are launched by _ magnetohydrodynamic _",
    "( mhd ) processes in the close vicinity of the central object  an accretion disk surrounding a protostar or a compact object @xcite .    over the past few years observational indication has been accumulated for axially symmetric differences in the radial velocity profile across protostellar jets and outflows .",
    "these radial velocity differences have repeatedly been interpreted as _ outflow rotation_. for one of the best studied examples , the micro - jet from dgtau , the suggested rotational velocity is about 6 - 15km / s at about @xmath0 arcsec or @xmath1au from the jet axis up to distances of 100au from the star @xcite .    as mhd outflows",
    "are launched from rotating sources by nature , the rotation of the outflow itself seems to be a characteristic feature of mhd jet formation models - from classic steady state models @xcite , non - relativistic @xcite or recent relativistic simulations @xcite .",
    "the transverse stability of relativistic jets has been treated by two - component simulations by @xcite . when jets originate in the inner part of a rapidly rotating disk ,",
    "the outflow material is launched with a substantial amount of angular momentum .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic models further imply angular momentum conservation along the streamlines of the outflow , and , thus , jet material which is persistently rotating .",
    "quantitative estimates of launching - induced jet rotation based on steady - state mhd models seem to be in agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "there are several arguments why this picture may not hold in general .",
    "the main argument is that the radial velocity profile is usually inferred from emission lines from _ shocked gas_. it is therefore questionable that classical steady - state mhd models can be used to fit the velocity and angular momentum balance along the jet across these shocks .",
    "furthermore , traditional non self - similar steady - state models of mhd jets indicate on both large initial jet opening angles and large jet radii compared to the alfvn radius @xmath2 . in that case , as the rotational velocity decreases with @xmath3 for @xmath4 , jet radii of @xmath5 would result in a negligible rotational velocity along the outer layers of a jet .",
    "we like to note here that the outflow velocity profile itself might be explained without implementing jet rotation at all , and , thus , without assuming a mhd launching model for the outflow .",
    "@xcite suggested a model in which a thick and twisted accretion disk interacts with the outflow by entrainment .",
    "inclination between the disk rotational axis and the jet axis would lead to a different amount of deceleration on both sides of the jet , thus visible in a velocity gradient across the jet .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different explanation for the observationally indicated outflow rotation .",
    "the model combines two basic features of mhd outflows - ( i ) the fact that the observed emission is from shocked gas , and ( ii ) the jet shock compressed helical field leads to a magnetic torque which accelerates the outflow material in toroidal direction .",
    "essentially , the jet kinetic angular momentum is retrieved from the magnetic angular momentum content of the jet across the shock .",
    "first hints of such a mechanism have been observed in numerical simulations by @xcite or @xcite , but were not discussed in great detail , or even applied to observations .    in the following ,",
    "we first summarize the observational findings concerning outflow rotation in jets from young stars and then briefly mention the case of extragalactic jets .",
    "we continue by discussing the governing mhd processes involved in our model , and present results of our mhd simulations .",
    "these simulations are preliminary in the sense that our emphasis is on the dynamical evolution of the outflow .",
    "this did not yet include further physical processes such as cooling ( apart from one example simulation ) , magnetic diffusivity , or radiative effects .",
    "here we summarize the observational background discussing a few typical , but different example sources where outflow rotation is observationally indicated .      to our knowledge ,",
    "first observational hints on jet rotation were provided by echelle spectroscopy of knots in the hh212 jet @xcite . for one of the inner knots ( sk1 , 2000au from the source ) , rotational velocities of @xmath6km / s",
    "were derived , while other knots in the same jet / counter - jet did not follow the same sense of rotation ( clockwise ) in spite of the almost perfect side - symmetry of hh212 and the fact the sense of rotation of the central molecular disk is clockwise as well @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the angular momentum of an inner accretion disk of 500au .",
    "assuming that all that angular momentum will be removed by a jet with mass ejection rate of 10% the accretion rate they conclude that hh212 may rotate with about 2km / s .",
    "if the disk angular momentum is removed by viscous transport only , the jet rotational velocity would be lower .",
    "we find this argument somewhat delusive as the high velocity jets is in fact launched close to the inner edge of the disk .",
    "thus , the disk material which is ejected into the jet at these small radii has _ low _",
    "specific angular momentum as it has lost most of its initial angular momentum during the accretion process from larger to smaller radii .    a corresponding search for outflow rotation in hh212 in sio shocks @xcite provided upper limits for rotational velocities only .",
    "applying angular momentum conservation for steady - state the inferred jet launching radii can be constrained to @xmath7au .",
    "most recent data of hh212 gave no clear signature of jet rotation , but also can not exclude rotation @xcite .",
    "in the case of hh211 , launching radii of @xmath8au were derived from possible jet rotation of @xmath9km / s @xcite .",
    "the ngc1333 iras4a2 system is another jet source for which recent sio observations indicate jet rotation by perpendicular velocity gradients @xcite .",
    "these features extend as far as almost 9000au from the central protostar with derived rotational speeds of about 3km / s and in corotation with the underlying disk .",
    "the observed doppler - shift of emission lines in the dgtau micro - jet @xcite give symmetric radial velocity differences of 6 - 15km / s for the low - velocity jet component .",
    "it is difficult to imagine any other velocity pattern than _ rotation _ to explain these radial velocity gradient across the jet .",
    "the authors estimate the corresponding angular momentum flux in the low velocity component to @xmath10 .",
    "more examples were detected by the same group @xcite , such as th28 and rwaur or lkh@xmath11 .",
    "for rwaur @xcite find toroidal velocities in the range of @xmath12km / s at distances 20 and 30au away from the jet axis .",
    "furthermore , both bipolar lobes rotate in the same direction .",
    "another candidate source for jet rotation is hltau for which fabry - pert interferometry has indicated a radial velocity gradient across the jet with a slope of 6km / s / arcsec @xcite . as for to dgtau , it is the low velocity component which shows a significant radial velocity slope while the radial velocity variation for the high velocity component is weak .",
    "indicate exists for rotation in molecular outflows as well . from sub - mm data of the bipolar outflow ori - s6 @xcite find bullets of in rotation of 5km / s , a co shell around the jet rotating with 2km / s ( at 1000au from the outflow axis ) , and a co envelope at distances of more than 2000au from the source still rotating with more then 0.5km / s , and rotation observed up to 25,000au distance from the source .",
    "another example is cb26 , a molecular outflow from a young ttauri star @xcite .",
    "detailed kinematic modeling accompanied by synthetic co maps suggest rotational velocities of about 1km / s 100au away from the outflow axis and at 1000au away from the source .",
    "alternative scenarios such as a precessing jet entraining material are discussed for this source and seem feasible as well .      in general",
    ", there is _ indirect _ indication of magnetic fields being present in protostellar jets .",
    "one argument has always been the magnetic activity of protostars showing large - scale flares on radio and x - rays and features of dipolar accretion indicating on a kg stellar surface field strength and also on a dipolar field distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "concerning the large - scale field structure , there is the unique example of ttau where cyclotron radiation have been detected which is aligned with the jet outflow in this source @xcite .",
    "the infered field strength is in the range of a g which is huge compared to what is required by current modeling .",
    "however , recent observations of massive star forming regions have detected maser emission in jet sources which allows for a direct measurement of the magnetic field strength .",
    "one example is the detection of the 3d field structure around the protostar cephahw2 with mg field strengths @xcite .",
    "synchrotron emission indicating a 0.2 mg field has been found related to the knots in the jet source hh80 - 81 @xcite .",
    "observational indication of rotation is lacking so far for extragalactic jets .",
    "in fact , we do not even have direct measurements of propagation speed for these sources . on the other hand ,",
    "clear evidence exists for a helical magnetic field structure in extragalactic jets indicated e.g. by gradients in the rotation measure across the jets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of radio synchrotron emission along these jets on time scales beyond the synchrotron cooling time requires re - heating of the jet material , most probably by internal shocks .",
    "together , the helical field structure and the internal shocks , provide the necessary prerequisites for the acceleration mechanism discussed below .",
    "therefore , signatures of jet rotation can also expected from these sources .",
    "in fact , there is one jet source where azimuthal jet motion has been detected .",
    "imaging interferometry of emission lines have detected a _ braided _ structure in the jet system of ngc4258 , which could be modeled by a triple helix of jet motion on 5 - 10kpc scale @xcite .",
    "this kpc jet is aligned with a nuclear vlba radio jet @xcite , thereby suggesting a physical connection . however , even if the helix model would explain the physical conditions in the kpc jet , there seems to be no plausible explanation yet about the intrinsic process causing such a complex outflow structure .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to note the relevance of jet rotation for modeling the heating of relativistic jet plasma by shear and centrifugal acceleration for electrons @xcite or protons @xcite .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic jets are launched from rotating sources .",
    "the initial acceleration is by centrifugal forces along the magnetic field lines ( magneto - centrifugal ) . beyond the alfvn point along each field line",
    ", the outflow material becomes inertially so heavy that co - rotation of matter and magnetic field can not longer be maintained .",
    "thus , the field lines will be `` bent '' from a mainly poloidal into a helical geometry ( a toroidal field component is induced ) .",
    "this allows the matter to `` slide '' along the field lines in toroidal direction . as a consequence , at large radii",
    "the jet material moves outwards in almost radial direction by conserving its total angular momentum . the angular velocity decreases with radius .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic acceleration and collimation of outflows implies transfer of magnetic energy to kinetic energy , and , likewise , transfer of kinetic angular momentum in magnetic angular momentum . the exact balance between these quantities results from the local force - balance throughout the outflow .",
    "the solution of the equations is complex and requires semi - analytical modeling and/or numerical mhd simulations .    for understanding the considerations of this paper ,",
    "it is helpful to re - call some basic properties of axisymmetric , stationary - state theory of mhd winds and jets ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in general",
    ", steady - state mhd implies the existence of conserved quantities along the magnetic flux surfaces . in the case of axisymmetry",
    "five such quantities can be defined .",
    "the first one is the magnetic flux , @xmath13 , indicating that magnetic field lines lie on magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "the second one is the mass flux @xmath14 per magnetic flux surface @xmath15 .",
    "the third one is ferraro s iso - rotation parameter @xmath16 , often interpreted as angular velocity of the field lines .",
    "the fourth one is the total ( specific ) angular momentum @xmath17 the fifth one is the total ( specific ) energy @xmath18 where , for simplicity , we have omitted gravity and gas pressure ( cold wind assumption ) . in steady - state theory @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21",
    "are governed by the regularity condition across the fast magnetosonic point , the alfvn point at @xmath22 , and the slow magnetosonic point , respectively .",
    "essentially , both the total energy and the total angular momentum ( flux ) consist of a magnetic and a kinetic contribution .",
    "a classical blandford - payne - type outflow is launched with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . beyond the alfvn point",
    "@xmath25 decreases and the magnetic field becomes dominated by @xmath26 .",
    "likewise , kinetic angular momentum of the ejected jet material , which is co - rotating with the disk , is increasingly transferred to the outflow magnetic angular momentum .",
    "the existence of conserved quantities along the field lines can be used to physically link the very inner region where the jet is launched ( not yet possible to resolve observationally ) to the asymptotic region of the outflow ( accessible for observations ) .",
    "@xcite have applied this formalism to the observed rotational features in the dgtau jet @xcite , obtaining launching radii of 0.3 - 4.0au .",
    "while this approach could be applied to the low velocity jet component , it does not fit , however , the high - velocity jet component of dgtau . using a similar method for the bipolar jet from rwaur",
    ", @xcite find launching radii less than 0.5au and a magnetic lever arm ( alfvn radius to launching radius ) of about four .",
    "in the following we will argue that the classical stationary mhd wind approach discussed above is questionable as sole explanation of rotating outflows . in the next section",
    "we will suggest and discuss an alternative scenario .",
    "our main argument is that radial velocity measurements of stellar jets and outflows usually consider line emission of shocked gas or molecules .",
    "for example , @xcite prove shock excitation of forbidden emission lines in dgtau and @xcite explicitely state that rotation is more evident in the forbidden lines [ oi ] and [ nii ] . during shock transition ,",
    "the jet material changes its dynamical state instantly .",
    "shock transitions are not included with the classical stationary state mhd wind theory . instead",
    ", conservation laws must be applied in form of jump conditions , and the direct connection of the observed rotating material with the disk by ideal mhd conservation laws is questionable .",
    "this argument may hold in particular for the large scale jets and outflows as e.g. for hh212 or molecular outflows",
    ". the molecular material might also trace entrained interstellar material . in this case",
    ", it has not been launched from the central region with intrinsic angular momentum .    early work on steady - state mhd jets has suggested that jets do expand substantially from their launching area close to the star to the asymptotic ( observed ) regime .",
    "expansion factors of 100 - 1000 ( from 0.1au up to 100au jet diameter ) have been suggested .",
    "these classical solutions predict alfvn radii @xmath27 of about ten foot point radii , @xmath28 and , therefore , a substantial decrease of the toroidal outflow velocities for radii @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "this is due to the large initial opening angles which are a result from non - self - similar mhd solutions ( see @xcite , but also recent simulations of stellar wind magnetospheres by @xcite resulting in a similar field geometry ) .",
    "we conclude that while being consistent with stationary state mhd jet formation , the formalism suggested by andersen et al . and subsequently applied by other authors is probably not a fully realistic picture to explain the observed jet rotation .",
    "in the following we discuss another framework of how jets and outflows may be set in rotation .",
    "the basic idea is that a compression of the toroidal magnetic field component in mhd shocks results in a lorentz torque in toroidal direction which accelerates the jet material .",
    "the jet kinetic angular momentum is retrieved from the magnetic angular momentum content of the jet by the shock .",
    "this mechanism works only for * helical * magnetic fields . while in stationary state",
    "mhd the kinetic and magnetic angular momentum is gradually exchanged along the flux surfaces , the shock wave leads to a sudden exchange .",
    "the mhd lorentz force is @xmath31 .",
    "jet rotation can be achieved by its toroidal component @xmath32 across the shock the toroidal field component is compressed , thus giving rise to a toroidal force component .",
    "the compression ratio itself depends on the jet dynamics . for simple geometries",
    "the field compression can be estimated by the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "more complex configurations require numerical simulations to follow the shock evolution .",
    "the magnetic flux is conserved across the shock , @xmath33 ^ 2_1 = 0 $ ] , but the perpendicular magnetic field component typically undergoes a change . in case of cylindrical coordinates ( which we are using here ) , the @xmath34-component replaces the perpendicular component in cartesian coordinates , resulting in an expression for the compression @xmath35 ^ 2_1}{b_z^2 } =   \\frac{2 m_z^2 { \\langle b_{\\phi}\\rangle}^2 / b_z^2}{m_z^2 - \\left ( b^2/4\\pi { \\langle\\rho^{\\star}\\rangle}\\right ) } \\,\\,\\frac{\\left[\\rho^{\\star}\\right]^2_1}{{\\langle\\rho^{\\star}\\rangle}},\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath36 denotes the ( conserved ) axial momentum , @xmath37 the averaged inverse density from upstream and downstream , @xmath38 ^ 2_1 $ ] the difference in the inverse density upstream and downstream , and @xmath39 the average toroidal field strength .",
    "the dynamical structure of the propagating shock could be complex . as typically for this setup , four shocks are existent , accompanied by a contact discontinuity , each satisfying the jump conditions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . considering the toroidal field strength , an increase within the first mhd ( fast ) shock",
    "is followed by a decrease across the second mhd ( slow ) shock , then again by an increase in the third ( slow mhd ) shock , and another decrease in the fourth ( fast mhd ) shock ( going from downstream to upstream ; see below and @xcite ) .",
    "a vast number of multi - dimensional jet propagation simulations have been published",
    ". only few of them apply a helical magnetic field configuration and some of those have already provided numerical indication for toroidal velocity changes due to toroidal magnetic torques in jet shocks . a connection to or predictions of the observable jet rotation",
    "has not been made ( such observations were not available in that time ) .",
    "early simulations of jet propagation do not show rotation @xcite since treating a purely toroidal magnetic field only .",
    "to our knowledge , the mhd simulations by @xcite were first indicating rotational velocity changes caused by a toroidal magnetic torque across a shock . applying jet parameters such as mach numbers of 4 , plasma-@xmath40 , and a helical field configuration @xmath41 the rotational velocities obtained",
    "were rather small @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite present mhd simulations in 1.5d and 2.5d which in particular compare 1.5d simulations in cylindrical coordinates to analytical solutions of steady mhd shocks . in their case , the rotational velocities obtained for @xmath43 simulations are comparatively high - in fact up to 10 - 40speed , and , thus , not realistic compared to the observed values .",
    "in fact , in a forthcoming paper on 3d simulations @xcite discuss such high azimuthal velocities as foremost indicator of a jet instability .",
    "@xcite investigate jet stability under the influence of helical magnetic fields , but do not discuss jet rotation in particular .",
    "simulations by @xcite consider both steady and pulsed mhd jets with helical magnetic field , in particular their cooling and stability properties , but again do not stress jet rotation .",
    "a basic prerequisite for the applicability of the process discussed in this paper is a sufficient amount of magnetic angular momentum available , which can be converted within the shock region .",
    "we may estimate the angular momentum budget from numerical models of the jet formation region which provide solutions to the mhd equations along the accelerating and expanding jet .    the amount of magnetic angular momentum flux @xmath44 in respect to the kinetic angular momentum flux @xmath45 depends crucially on the mhd state of the flow .",
    "analytical estimates @xcite show that for sub - alfvnic flows @xmath46 , while for marginally super - fast flows @xmath47 . for a ( poloidal )",
    "fast magnetosonic mach number @xmath48 the kinetic angular momentum flux dominates , @xmath49 .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd jet formation from keplerian disks show , however , that typically only the inner jet ( the part close to the jet axis ) becomes super - fast magnetosonic @xcite .",
    "this suggests an asymptotic jet structure consisting of a narrow core dominated by kinetic angular momentum , which is wrapped by an envelope dominated by magnetic angular momentum flux .",
    "it is this envelope around the core jet , which i ) ( shock- ) interacts with the ambient medium , and ii ) is accessible to the observations .",
    "thus , for the purpose of this paper it is convenient to assume that a substantial ( i.e. sufficient ) amount of magnetic angular momentum is present in the asymptotic jet .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd jet formation from keplerian disks also show quite a variety in the asymptotic jet outflow they produce ( and which is subject to the present paper ) .",
    "we refer to our past work @xcite which in very detail investigated how the launching conditions as the disk magnetic field profile and strength and also the mass flux distribution affects the asymtotic flow .",
    "in particular the radial profile of the disk wind magnetization ( steep or flat ) determines the collimation of the outflow ( weakly , resp .",
    "strongly collimated ) .",
    "we therefore decided to scan a rather large parameter range in the typical jet characteristics as mach number or plasma beta .",
    "recently @xcite have performed jet formation simulations spanning from the disk surface well into the asymptotic regime , enclosing a huge , yet unprecedented area of @xmath50au size .",
    "these simulations show i ) that a well ordered , global field distribution remains present also for the most distant outflow regime , ii ) that the asymptotic flows launched with different initial plasma-@xmath51 tend to approach asymptotic states with average plasma-@xmath51 close to unity ( although there is still quite a spread during the simulation time scales considered ) , and iii ) that flows of different initial plasma-@xmath51 may reach quite different asymptotic states concerning mass fluxes of velocities .    in summery , we decided to run our simulations for a variety of leading jet parameters , considering also the fact that jets from protostars and agn could be intrinsically different .",
    "in order to quantify the toroidal torque in jets and the subsequent toroidal velocity structure , we perform mhd simulations of jet propagation applying different flow geometries , magnetic field distributions , and jet dynamical parameters . in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism , we inject the jet material non - rotating , thus with vanishing kinetic angular momentum .",
    "we use the pluto code @xcite to solve the standard set of ideal mhd equations .",
    "we apply an ideal equation of state with polytropic index @xmath52 .",
    "we also discuss one example simulation for which cooling is considered .    in order to re - scale normalized code variables to astrophysical magnitudes",

    ".    it would be interesting to extend the present investigation to the 3d case in a future paper .",
    "although the principle mechanism proposed here will be the same in the 3d case , the overall jet structure could be different and also the characteristic instabilities affecting the jet flow .",
    "in particular large - scale instabilities as the @xmath68 kink mode could appear and disturb the jet flow .",

    "however , jet material and ambient gas are coupled by the magnetic field which is anchored into both components . the differential rotation between jet and ambient gas results in shear and torques . in later evolutionary stages when the jet has bored its funnel through the ambient gas , the differential rotation decreases , and the twist in the field structure is reduced .",
    "jet injections of different velocity will then lead to internal shocks ( see simulation r16 , fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_run16a ] , [ fig : sim_run16b ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sim_am_evol_r01 ] reveals the time sequence of the angular momentum evolution as domain - integrated value for simulation r01 .",
    "shown are the different contributions to the total angular momentum budget ( i.e. not their specific value ) . since this is an density - weighted value , it is observationally more relevant than the specific value ( simply speaking , more gas will radiate more ) .",
    "the observed jet rotation will not only depend on the rotation speed alone , but also on how much material is in fact rotating with such speed .",
    "the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_am_evol_r01 ] shows at time @xmath135 the kinetic angular momentum on average more positive than negative .",
    "this suggests that one may observe on average a positive rotation of the jet although the negative velocity distribution is broader ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sim_run01 ] ) .",
    "the jet terminal shock leaves the computational domain .",
    "[ fig : sim_am_evol_r01 ] ]     ]    at dynamical time @xmath136 the jet bow shock leaves the computational domain .",
    "the jet material set into rotation by the processes we have discussed above will propagate out of the computational domain . since simulation r01 has a time - independent injection boundary condition ,",
    "no new shocks will be initiated which could enforce rotation and the overall jet rotation will fade away - as indicated by fig .  [",
    "fig : sim_run01 ] .    as for simulation r01",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_am_evol_r12 ] the time evolution for the different contributions to the angular momentum budget for simulation r12 . in difference",
    "to r01 the amount of angular momentum is constantly growing .",
    "this is due to the presence of the steady reflection shock which continue to convert magnetic angular momentum to kinetic angular momentum , even when the bow shock has left the computational domain .",
    "we have performed axisymmetric mhd simulations of jet propagation into an ambient gas applying the pluto code . the goal of our study was to investigate how the gas flow in jets and outflows is set in rotation by lorentz forces arising mhd shocks .",
    "the process we discuss relies on a helical magnetic field structure which carries magnetic angular momentum from the jet base to the asymptotic jet .",
    "this could be converted into kinetic angular momentum by action of a toroidal torque which is induced by shock compression of the toroidal field . to demonstrate the applicability of the principal mechanism , for simplicity we have injected a _",
    "non - rotating _ jet material into the ambient gas for most cases .",
    "our simulations show that the proposed mechanism is indeed feasible , and accelerates the jet in toroidal direction by lorentz forces which are induced by a shock compressed toroidal magnetic field . depending on the magnetohydrodynamic parameters of the jet flow , the resulting rotational velocities are in the range of @xmath137 of the jet propagation speed .",
    "jets with a high external mach number gain the highest rotation speed .",
    "this is because the mechanism works most efficient in the termination shock .",
    "the resulting velocity field is highly complex resulting in a filamentary structure in the toroidal torque and toroidal velocity distribution .",
    "the material which is set in rotation across the terminal shock , flows back respective to the propagating jet and forms a cocoon with a highly tangled rotation pattern .",
    "interestingly , of jets with the same initial magnetic angular momentum budget ( i.e. same @xmath138 ) , those with a low poloidal field ( low magnetic flux ) experience a stronger toroidal torque , and , thus gain higher rotational speed .",
    "this is a consequence of the higher compression rates due to the weaker poloidal field ( more j - type than c - type shock ) .    for the jets with steady injection",
    ", the toroidal velocity field decays as soon as the bow shock has left the computational domain . on the long term",
    "the injected gas flows along the channel bored by the jet during previous time steps and only weakly interacts with the ambient medium . for jets with time - dependent injection ,",
    "further shocks are generated at a constant rate maintaining the jet rotation .",
    "jets with low internal mach number develop standing oblique reflection shocks which constantly ( but stepwise ) accelerate the jet material in toroidal direction .    in summary , by demonstrating the feasibility of toroidal jet acceleration by mhd shocks in a helical magnetic field , we propose the following implications .",
    "\\i ) jets of young stars are typically seen in radiation of shocked gas .",
    "thus we expect this material to be affected by toroidal torques along its path from the jet launching region close to the star up to asymptotic regime of a collimated jet .",
    "to extrapolate from observed angular velocities far from the source to the angular momentum of the jet material close to its origin is therefore questionable .",
    "\\ii ) jet rotation , as observationally indicated in jets from young stars is feasible .",
    "jets emerge from rotating disks and are ejected with kinetic angular momentum .",
    "in addition to this , mhd shocks could additionally accelerate the jet material by further converting magnetic to kinetic angular momentum .",
    "\\iii ) similar processes can be expected from relativistic stellar jets and extragalactic jets , leading to a rapid rotation in these jets .",
    "the results presented in this paper are derived from kinetic / dynamical modeling .",
    "preliminary simulations considering cooling indicate not major effect , although we see that cooling results in a somewhat stronger shock compression and therefore slightly higher maximum rotation speeds . detailed comparison with observations would require also modeling of radiation processes ( radiative mhd ) , or post - processing of emission maps , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "i thank the andrea mignone and the pluto team for the possibility to use their code .",
    "i also acknowledge many interesting and fruitful discussions with bhargav vaidya and oliver porth .",
    "my thanks go as well to an unknown referee who contributed a number of suggestions which clearly have improved the paper .",
    "here we show comparison simulations applying a similar set of parameters ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : para-1db ] ) as @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ryu11 ] shows simulation rj11 which basically repeats the simulation shown in @xcite , fig .  2a , for which we have applied cartesian coordinates as well .",
    "figure [ fig : ryu09 ] shows simulation rj09 with similar dynamical parameters , but run in a cylindrical coordinate system , which can be considered more appropriate to our general aim of investigating jet rotation . in the latter case we have considered only one perpendicular vector component . the initial setup with vanishing radial magnetic field and vanishing radial motion is very well conserved .",
