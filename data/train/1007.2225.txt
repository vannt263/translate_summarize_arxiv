    "the antarctic continent is the highest , driest and coldest of the continents on the earth .",
    "it is the end of the earth , literally as well metaphorically . as with all endeavours in antarctica",
    ", it was the last continent where humans began to conduct astronomical observations from .",
    "the first astronomical discovery was made less than a century ago , and it has only been in the past two decades that major ventures in the discipline have taken place . yet , with current technology , astronomy is no longer difficult to undertake in antarctica , given appropriate resources and fore - planning",
    ". moreover , the potential antarctica offers for furthering a wide and diverse range of frontier investigations in astronomy is unmatched , in comparison with any other location on our planet .",
    "antarctica is the fifth largest continent , with a land area of 14 square million kilometres .",
    "the amount of exposed land is , however , tiny , about 2% of the total and confined almost entirely to the coastal fringe . as a continent , antarctica",
    "is dominated by ice , with the area covered virtually doubling between the summer and winter extremes ; the ice sheets extend up to one thousand kilometres over the southern ocean from the coast at their september peak . from an astronomer s",
    "perspective it is the ice mass of the antarctic plateau that draws the attention . for ,",
    "while the continent is crossed by one of the world s great mountain ranges , the trans antarctic mountains that stretch nearly 5,000 km from the weddell sea to the ross sea , all but its highest peaks ( the nunataks ) are obscured from view , buried under the ice sheet that makes up the antarctic plateau .",
    "the land itself lies under up to four kilometres of ice , with the ice surface very gradually rising from the coast , over a distance of several hundred kilometres , to reach over 4,000 m at dome a ( though the peaks of some of the mountains rise higher than this , for instance the vinson massif in west antarctica is 4,897 m high ) .",
    "the area of ice over 3,000 m elevation is almost as large as the continent of australia .",
    "this is the antarctic plateau .",
    "its great extent makes antarctica the highest continent , as measured by average elevation .",
    "it also contains the coldest and driest regions of our planet .",
    "a temperature of @xmath1c was once measured at the russian vostok station , the lowest ever recorded , and winters average @xmath2c over the plateau .",
    "typical precipitable water vapour levels of 250@xmath3 m exist for much of the year and levels can fall below 100@xmath3 m in places at times , the driest air on earth .    of crucial importance for the conduct of astronomy",
    "is that there is little wind on top of the plateau .",
    "the antarctic atmospheric circulation pattern centres about the south pole , and the dominant airflow is a slow settling from the stratosphere , to feed a steady , downward - flowing wind off the plateau .",
    "this wind is katabatic in origin , starting from the highest points and picking up speed as it falls towards the coast , under gravity . with an average slope of about one tenth of a degree , the wind is also gentle . over the highest parts of the plateau",
    "typical wind speeds are only 1 - 2 m/s .",
    "though , as it nears the coast and the gradient increases , the wind speed picks up  and can lead to the ferocious storms that are a part of antarctic folklore .",
    "the debilitating effects of the atmosphere are largely confined to a thin turbulent surface boundary layer . in winter",
    "this can be only a few metres thick over the summits of the plateau . above it ,",
    "the seeing is exceptionally low .",
    "so too is the level of scintillation noise , and both the isoplanatic angle and coherence time are large , in comparison with the best temperate latitude sites .",
    "these facets provide conditions than can yield extraordinary image clarity and stability for a wide range astronomical observations .",
    "as these conditions have been quantified over the past decade , and their implications understood , they have drawn the interest of astronomers to the continent for its potential to provide superlative observatory sites .",
    "this paper provides an overview of the subject of astronomy in antarctica .",
    "we describe the features of the continent of special interest to astronomers , and the sites under consideration for observatories .",
    "we also summarise the principal results obtained from the extensive program of site testing of the antarctic plateau that has taken place over the past two decades .",
    "a brief history of the development of astronomy in antarctica is given , followed by examples of some of the science obtained .",
    "as will be apparent , this includes a diverse range of fields as well as techniques .",
    "a section discusses how science is conducted in antarctica today , and what the principal difficulties are for the investigator , in comparison to undertaking temperate - latitude astronomy .",
    "the review finishes with some personal thoughts of where astronomy will develop on the continent over the coming years .",
    "many sources have been drawn upon for this review , and in particular it extends the earlier reviews of storey ( 2005 ) , burton ( 2005 ) and storey ( 2009 ) .",
    "several books have been devoted entirely to astronomy in antarctica , the proceedings of conferences held on the subject .",
    "they include the proceedings of the american institute of physics conference on astronomy in antarctica in newark , usa in 1989 ( pomerantz 1990 ) , the astronomical society of the pacific symposium on astronomy in antarctica in chicago , usa in 1997 ( novak & landsberg , 1998 ) , the concordia station workshop in capri , italy in 2003 ( fossat & candidi 2003 ) and the three european arena conferences , held in roscoff , france in 2006 ( epchtein & candidi 2007 ) , potsdam , germany in 2007 ( zinnecker , epchtein & rauer 2008 ) and frascati , italy in 2009 ( spinoglio & epchtein 2010 ) .",

    "it recently completed a major refurbishment , and supports around 60 personnel over - wintering and @xmath5 in the summer months .",
    "access is via ski - equipped lc130 aircraft from mcmurdo station on the coast , with daily flights over the summer period from november to february .",

    "m dome c is one of the high points of the plateau , where the conditions are at their most stable .",
    "extensive site quantification has taken place over the past decade , starting from before the station opened for winter operation .",
    "plans for a range of facilities to exploit the conditions there have been developed by several european nations and by australia .",

    "twin otter aircraft are used , generally starting from either dumont durville or from mario zucchelli station ( italy ) .",
    "the highest location on the plateau is the 4,083 m dome a , first visited by humans in just 2005 by a chinese team on a tractor traverse from zhongshan station . in 2009",
    "china began the construction of kunlun station at the site .",
    "already several astronomical experiments have been conducted here , making use of an australian robotic observatory .",
    "ambitious plans are being formulated for ir and thz telescopes within the next decade .",
    "currently one traverse is conducted each summer season , carrying all people and @xmath6 tonnes of equipment .",
    "no winter - overs have yet been conducted .",
    "there are other high plateau sites where astronomy could be conducted .",
    "these include the russian station of vostok ( 3,488 m ) and the japanese station at dome f ( 3,810 m ) , both of which have stations that have been used for wintering .",
    "site testing is being initiated at dome f. another ice dome , dome b ( 3,809 m ) , lies on the se end of the ridge from dome a , before the plateau drops towards vostok . ridge a ( 4,053 m ) , lying at the end of a ridge running sw from dome a , has also been proposed as a site where conditions may even be superior to dome a for some applications .",
    "not all antarctic astronomy needs to be done on the plateau , however , in particular cosmic - ray observations .",
    "facilities for such measurements exist at the coastal stations of mawson ( australia ) and mcmurdo ( usa ) .",
    "neutron monitors also operate at several coastal locations . in addition , mcmurdo houses a long - duration balloon facility , taking advantage of the high - altitude circumpolar winds which permit balloons to remain aloft for periods of 10 - 30 days at times during summer , circling the continent as they do so .",

    "the cold reduces background fluxes in the infrared . over infrared to sub - millimetre wavelengths the dry air results in many windows in the atmosphere opening up to observation . a host of secondary factors provide additional reasons for astronomers to conduct observations from antarctica ( see also tables  [ table : gains ] & [ table : techniques ] ) .",
    "these include the stability of the atmosphere and its thin surface boundary layer , low levels of pollution and dust aerosols in the air , high cloud - free fractions , the ability to conduct continuous or long - duration monitoring , increased low - energy cosmic - ray fluxes arising from the proximity to the magnetic pole , low levels of seismic activity and the vast quantities of pure ice available as an absorber of particles .",
    "some of these secondary factors have proven to be particularly potent .",
    "for instance , the ice is being used to construct a neutrino detector at the south pole with a cubic kilometre of collecting volume ( icecube ) .",
    "the confinement of most of the turbulence in the air to a thin layer just above the ice , over the summits of the plateau , creates conditions that are particularly favourable for wavefront correction of light , as well as providing telescopes with extraordinary good seeing if they were to be raised beyond the boundary layer .",

    "the temperature drop from freezing point to @xmath2c , about the change going from mauna kea in hawaii to the south pole in winter , would lead to a fall in the sky background of 200 times at 2.4@xmath3 m , if the sky were thermally emitting as a blackbody .",
    "the realisation that this drop could open a new window for deep cosmological studies drove initial efforts to quantify the infrared sky emission in antarctica ( harper 1990 , burton , allen & mcgregor 1993 ) .",
    "subsequent measurements found the drop to be a factor of @xmath18 at the south pole , being limited by residual high - altitude airglow emission ( nguyen et al .",

    "; see fig .",

    "however , from 3 - 30@xmath3 m the sky background was also found to be 1020 times darker than at the best temperate latitude sites ( see fig .  [",

    "such gains at mid - ir wavelengths were unexpected , for the drop in the blackbody flux near its peak emission wavelength is only a factor of 23 for the fall in temperature .",
    "it turned out that in the mid - ir the emission from aerosols also dropped significantly , with only ice crystals contributing to the emission , and not the dust found at temperate sites .",
    "longwards of 20@xmath3 m the drop in background is less , and arises principally from the reduced water vapour in the air , lowering the emissivity of the atmospheric windows .",
    "only summer ( i.e.  day time ) thermal ir measurements have so far been obtained from a high plateau site ( dome c ; walden et al .",

    "similarly , observations from 20 - 30@xmath3 m could be routinely made . from the highest plateau site ,",
    "dome a , windows are conjectured to appear across the 30 to 300@xmath3 m range that are opaque from any other ground - based location .",
    "the first measurements from dome a of water vapour content have recently been made , supporting these assertions .",
    "they used a tipping radiometer operating at 450@xmath3 m ( 661ghz ) on the plato laboratory ( saunders et al .",
    "2009 ) , further correlated with satellite radiometry from above ( the noaa-18 satellite observing in the 183ghz h@xmath22o line ) .",
    "a median value of 140@xmath3 m ppt h@xmath22o was found , a 25% quartile of just @xmath23 m and the ppt h@xmath22o level fell to 25@xmath3 m at its lowest , comparable to that experienced by an aircraft flying in the stratosphere ( _ e.g. _ sofia ) .",
    "these conditions dramatically open up atmospheric windows across the entire infrared and sub - millimetre regimes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] ; hidas et al.2000 , lawrence 2004 ) . for instance , for 100@xmath3 m of ppt h@xmath22o the atmospheric transmission is 28% at the 205@xmath3 m wavelength ( 1.45 thz ) of the important [ nii ] line .",
    "initial summer time measurements of the atmospheric transparency have also been obtained from dome f ( ishii et al .",
    "2010 ) , using a tipping radiometer operating at 220ghz .",
    "an extremely low mean opacity of 0.045 was determined ( comparable to south pole and chajnantor winter median values ) , and varying little over the 1 month period of the measurements .",
    "the authors model this data with 0.6 mm of precipitable water vapour",
    ".    there may be even better sites for astronomy on the plateau .",
    "a ridge runs south and west from dome a and @xmath24 km sw is a location called `` ridge a '' .",

    "( 2010 ) deduce even lower 25% and 50% quartiles for the water vapour than for dome a , of 80@xmath3 m and 120@xmath3 m , respectively . the 158@xmath3 m window ( 1.9thz and dominant [ cii ] line )",
    "would even open at times , with a transmission of more than 11% for 10% of the time .",
    "such remarkable conjectures call for in situ measurements of the water vapour content to be carried out at ridge a to examine their veracity .    in the near  ir , from 12.5@xmath3 m ,",
    "models by siebenmorgen ( 2010 ) show that the average transmission at dome c exceeds 40% at all wavelengths , when measured with a resolution r=250 ( there are , of course , narrow spectral regions which remain saturated ) .",
    "this results in a widening of the j , h & k bands from 1 - 2.5@xmath3 m , and of the l & m bands at 3.6 & 5.0@xmath3 m .",
    "[ [ stability ] ] stability + + + + + + + + +    less appreciated , but equally important for the conduct of many kinds of observation , is the stability provided by the atmosphere , particularly for measurements that can mitigate the effects of a thin , but turbulent , surface boundary layer .",

    ", these gains have implications not only for observations using conventional single - mirror telescopes but also for solar telescopes and for interferometers .    at the south pole",
    "there is no diurnal cycle and so no corresponding daily temperature changes  simply the 6-month cycle of night and day .",
    "any source beyond the solar system that can be observed can also be seen continuously , and at constant zenith angle .",
    "this greatly facilitates experiments which require continuous monitoring or high duty cycles .",
    "it is also favourable for following particle cascades in air showers as a source is always seen through the same depth of atmosphere . in the ir , beyond 3@xmath3 m , it is perfectly feasible to observe all year round , the temperature being cold enough to facilitate day time observations . away from the pole there is , of course , a latitude - dependent seasonal diurnal cycle , and the length of the period of continuous darkness",
    "is reduced , but many of the advantages remain .    not only is the strength of the sky background emission reduced in antarctica , its level is more stable at ir and sub - mm wavelengths than at temperate sites ( smith & harper 1998 , peterson et al .",
    "indeed , it is fluctuations in the level of the background ( both spatially and temporally ) that can provide the limiting factor for photometric measurements in these bands . at 350@xmath3 m ( 860ghz ) , while peterson et al .",
    "found that the median sky opacity at south pole and chajnantor ( chile ) to be similar ( 1.20 _ vs. _ 1.39 , respectively ) , the fluctuations in the opacity level were found to be @xmath25 times lower at pole during the best observing conditions , when the opacity is below unity ",
    "i.e.  when observations at these wavelengths could be made .    for cmbr measurements , made in the microwave bands ,",
    "the south pole has proved to be a superb site , as attested by the wealth of science that has been achieved ( see  [ sec : cmbr ] ) .",
    "for instance , at 220ghz the zenith opacity is just @xmath26 and the median brightness power fluctuations are an order of magnitude lower than at any established temperate sites ( at @xmath27 in rayleigh - jeans temperature units ; bussmann , holzapfel & kuo , 2005 ) .",

    ". the temperature can rise by up to @xmath28c in heights of a few tens of metres .",
    "virtually all the turbulence responsible for seeing at optical and infrared wavelengths , the result of micro - thermal temperature fluctuations causing refractive index changes , is confined to this boundary layer .",
    "dealing with the boundary layer is one of the most challenging problems facing designers of optical and infrared telescopes in antarctica ( see  [ sec : challenges ] ) , but if its mitigating effects can be overcome then the antarctic plateau offers sharper imaging , more precise photometry and superior astrometric precision than measurements made from any other place on earth .",
    "of course , such a statement applies to any ground - based telescope , but the narrow boundary layer above the antarctic plateau suggests that this might be readily accomplished there , for instance by building a tower that extends above it .",
    "the free air seeing in the visible , above the surface boundary layer , is typically a factor of two better than the @xmath29 seeing above the best temperate sites .",
    "the proximity of the turbulent boundary layer to the telescope also results in reduced values for the scintillation noise , since the ` lever arm ' , from the turbulent atmospheric cells that de - focus the light to the telescope , is much reduced .",
    "since scintillation provides the limiting factor to the error in a flux measurement , this implies that improved photometric precision is also possible .",
    "two further quantities are also very important in determining site quality ; the coherence time and the isoplanatic angle of the turbulent cells . since the cells are located close to the surface over the antarctic plateau , and pass across the telescope field of view relatively slowly , the above two parameters are larger than found at temperate sites , where the cells are at high altitude and move rapidly . longer coherence times and larger isoplanatic angles feeds into improved performance for adaptive optics systems ( e.g.  larger bandwidth , fainter reference stars ) . for an interferometer",
    ", it also results in improved signal to noise and improvement in the achievable astrometric precision ( e.g.  lloyd et al .",

    "while this qualification of site properties remains incomplete , substantial information is now available , or can be inferred through modelling , so that a quantitative picture of observing conditions over the antarctic plateau can be deduced .",

    "( 2008 ) , unique operational aspects of an antarctic observatory arise from its remoteness , the polar environment and the unusual observing cycle afforded by long periods of darkness and daylight . a telescope must be designed for remote observing via satellite communications , and must overcome both limited physical access and data transfer rates . commissioning and lifetime operations must deal with extended logistics chains , continual wintertime darkness , extremely low temperatures and frost accumulation .",
    "one of the most difficult issues for many astronomical applications has been the supply and maintenance of cryogens , especially liquid helium , which must be flown in from the mainland .",
    "even with just a 1% evaporation loss per day , by mid - winter a helium supply would be exhausted , so halting sub - millimetre and cmbr experiments , for instance .",
    "fortunately , with the continued development of closed - cycle systems for instruments , this should become a problem of the past .",
    "the design challenges caused by the extreme cold are dominated by the continued performance of lubricants , the mechanical clearances that may change due to thermally induced dimensional changes , and the operation of electronics designed for a room temperature environment . however , all of these issues are quite readily overcome with proper mechanical design , so long as it takes account of the temperature requirements .",
    "the high rates of change of temperature that can take place within the boundary layer can be more problematic , especially for components with high thermal mass and tight thermal equilibrium requirements  notably , the primary mirror of a telescope .",
    "in addition to the debilitating effects on image quality caused by turbulence , the surface layer also poses an engineering challenge for two further reasons .",
    "the first is the large vertical temperature gradient that can occur within it ( up to @xmath87/m at surface level and even @xmath88/m at 30 m at dome c ) , especially on the most stable days in winter .",
    "the second is the super - saturated humidity within the layer , which readily leads to icing on exposed surfaces . to solve both these problems ,",
    "a temperature and humidity - controlled enclosure for a telescope may be required ( e.g.see saunders et al .",
    "such an enclosure ( e.g. see fig .  [",
    "fig : pilot ] ) could be continuously flushed with sub - saturated air , matched in temperature to the external air at the dome aperture .",
    "this air is drawn from closer to the surface of the snow ( where it is colder , and so drier ) .",
    "it could be heated using waste heat from the instrumentation , resulting in its humidity falling below the saturation point .",
    "in addition , such a scheme could deliver excellent dome seeing , as the temperatures could be closely matched and venting conducted so that the external airflow suffers minimal disruption .",
    "there is also a need to consider how to provide electrical power for any significant astronomical facility , which might require several tens of kw .",
    "this might not readily be expected to be drawn from a station diesel power supply .",
    "however solar energy ( in summer ) and wind power ( the turbine mounted on a tower to place it above the boundary layer , where a steady wind blows ) could provide a clean energy source for observatories . as discussed by mcgrath et al.(2008 ) , this only imposes a modest addition to the total cost of a facility .",
    "a clean energy source may also be necessary to gain public support for a new facility , so minimising pollution and maintaining the pristine condition of the environment .",
    "in particular , it would minimise contributions from locally produced aerosols ( e.g.  from the exhausts of diesel generators ) , important for maintaining the stability of the local sky emission .",

    "the treaty bypasses issues of sovereignty by not recognising any territorial claims made while the treaty is in force .",
    "it states that antarctica is to be used for peaceful purposes only , with scientific investigation and collaboration specifically encouraged .",
    "the antarctic treaty is in fact a remarkably short and simple document comprising just 14 articles .",
    "seven nations have laid claim to parts of antarctica ( argentina , australia , britain , chile , france , norway and new zealand ) , with argentina , britain and chile having overlapping claims .",
    "the usa , on the other hand , has not made a claim , but has reserved the right to do so .",
    "the treaty avoids any issue over these claims by neither recognising them nor denying them .",
    "any country ( or indeed person ) is free to go anywhere in antarctica without restriction , assuming they have the means to do so .",
    "a measure of the antarctic treaty s success is that there remains a large sector of west antarctica that has not been claimed by any nation .",
    "the treaty was further strengthened in 1991 by the adoption of the madrid protocol .",
    "this defines antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science , and specifically forbids any mineral activity , except for research .",
    "it also strengthened measures for the conservation of flora and fauna , and set up standards for waste management .",
    "scar , the scientific committee for antarctic research , is the peak body for antarctic affairs . established in 1957 , as a committee of icsu , the international council for science , scar is charged with the initiation , promotion and co - ordination of scientific research in antarctica . within scar",
    "there are 31 full members ( countries with active research programs in antarctica ) , 4 associate members ( countries without independent research programs in antarctica ) and 9 union members ( those icsu scientific unions with an interest in antarctica research ) .",
    "the iau ( international astronomical union ) is one of these union members .",
    "operating alongside scar are a number of bodies that have been set up by further international treaties in order to manage the conservation of flora and fauna in and around antarctica , including particularly that in the southern ocean .",
    "scar holds an open science congress every two years , which also serves as the major forum bringing together the managers of national antarctic programs . through a motion put forward at its @xmath89 congress in rome in 1994 ,",
    "scar passed a resolution recognising the scientific value of antarctic astronomy and calling for the development of the field .    like the iau",
    ", scar has numerous divisions within it .",
    "there are three standing scientific groups ( ssgs ) , covering geo sciences , life sciences and physical sciences .",
    "there are also five scientific research programs ( srps ) , which have a focus on international scientific co - ordination . in 2010",
    "astronomy became one of these programs ",
    "_ astronomy and astrophysics from antarctica _ ( aaa )  replacing the icestar program ( involving solar - terrestrial & aeronomy research ) .",
    "john storey , of the university of new south wales , has been appointed the first chief officer of aaa , which has set for itself several goals ( see storey , 2010 ) .",
    "these involve the coordination of site testing activities ( including related activities in the arctic ) and the provision of publically accessible data bases for their data , as well as improving cooperation with other physical sciences .",
    "they also look to future development : defining and prioritising science goals , creating a roadmap for developing future astronomical facilities and stimulating international cooperation to construct and use those facilities . to undertake this work aaa",
    "has been structured into four themes , covering site testing , the arctic , science goals and major facilities .",
    "the international astronomical union also supports the development of the astronomy in antarctic . at the iau",
    "s @xmath90 general assembly , in buenos aires in 1991 , a working group _ encouraging the international development of antarctic astronomy _ was formed , with peter gillingham of the anglo australian observatory as its first chair .",
    "the author is the current chair .",
    "the iau passed a resolution at that general assembly encouraging the development of the then fledgling field .",
    "the working group is under the auspices of two iau divisions ( division ix on optical & infrared techniques and division x on radio astronomy ) .",
    "there have been regular sessions on antarctic astronomy at subsequent iau general assemblies ( see gillingham ( ed ) 1992 , burton ( ed ) 2005b , 2007 , 2010b ) , as well as several international conferences and workshops devoted to aspects of the field .",
    "scar and the iau serve principally as fora where scientists can come together to discuss progress and plans for their fields of endeavour .",
    "they do not fund antarctic science , however , for that is the province of nations , acting either individually or collaboratively .",
    "the funding process itself , for deciding upon and supporting antarctic science , differs considerably between nations .",
    "these have evolved according to the antarctic traditions and histories within individual countries , to differing national priorities , including whether a nation has made territorial claim to the continent , and to the different cultures surrounding science funding . in some countries",
    "antarctic science is confined mainly within their national antarctic agency , with both the logistics and science conducted by that agency . in other countries ,",
    "science funding is separated from the logistics of operating the bases .",
    "more commonly , a mix of the two exists ( see burton , 2005 ) .",
    "while the peer review process might be followed for determining on science priorities , this is often contained within pre - defined government goals for antarctica .",
    "these can serve to support current activities but make it difficult for new ones to emerge .",
    "this has created difficulties for furthering astronomy in antarctica in many nations , for astronomy is not a traditional antarctic science .",
    "it can be excluded from a national antarctic program by falling outside those goals , and so need to seek support from other funding agencies .",
    "these agencies are , quite often , resistant to funding research in antarctica as they argue that it should be funded by the national antarctic program . with no agency clearly responsible for deciding upon funding for astronomical ventures in antarctica",
    ", it can be difficult to develop astronomical programs in antarctica beyond relatively low - cost site testing activities , despite the well - recognised strength of many of the science cases that have been made .",
    "those nations that have managed to resile this conflict , between supplying the logistics and deciding upon the science , have managed to do the best antarctic science , regardless of the scientific discipline .",
    "no where is this success more apparent than in the exotic range of science now evident at the south pole , nurtured slowly over three decades of planning and pursuit .    despite these differences between funding policies of nations , collaborative activity forged between scientists can be a spontaneous event , with national boundaries playing little role .",
    "one of the delights of working as an antarctic scientist is the relative ease with which international collaborations can be made .",
    "if you can devise an experiment that will be advantageous to conduct at the station of another country , that country can generally be persuaded to support you .",
    "of course , it needs to be logistically possible to set - up and operate the experiment .",
    "there also need to be scientists from the host country supporting the project , and it will have to pass through an assessment process to determine its relative standing among other projects .",
    "but once these steps are taken , the nation running the base will take it there , and provide the logistics to install the experiment , all without charge .",
    "it is up to the experimenter to find the funds and personnel to build the experiment in the first place , but most of the operations costs become subsumed in those of the station .",
    "the science , of course , needs to be shared among all the partners involved .",
    "extensive science cases have been written for astronomy in antarctica , a diverse range of facilities proposed , funding sought for some of them and roadmaps prepared for future developments . yet",
    "any words written today , about what astronomy will be done in antarctica tomorrow , will almost certainly contain more speculation than fact .",
    "this section therefore will only briefly discuss the many ideas that are current , and try to draw together common themes that indicate likely future directions .",
    "some areas of science have been well served in antarctica , with potent science cases leading to funded facilities , following staged development programs which will continue over the coming decade .",
    "this clearly is the case with the fields of cmbr and neutrino astrophysics .",
    "both are characterised by a series of increasingly sensitive experiments , though for the former these have yielded detections of subtle effects while for the latter non - detections . yet both fields have essentially followed the path expected of them by the quantitative predictions underpinning their science .",
    "traditional photon astronomy has , however , not been so well served by antarctic astronomy , with only modest - sized facilities built so far for observations in the infrared and sub - millimetre .",
    "we therefore consider here some of the science and facilities envisaged for the thermal - ir and thz portions of these spectral regimes .",
    "a series of science cases have been developed for antarctic facilities , focussed largely on the prospects for infrared astronomy given the greater sensitivity of an antarctic telescope over an equivalent - sized mid - latitude facility ( e.g.  burton et al .",
    "1994 , burton et al .",
    "2001 , burton et al .",
    "2005 , lawrence et al .  2009a , 2009b , 2009c ) .",
    "these science cases have concentrated on intermediate - scale facilities ( i.e.  2m - class telescopes ) , perceived as the most likely size for the next antarctic ir telescope .",
    "the capabilities of ir facilities elsewhere , both on earth and in space , have improved dramatically over this period .",
    "so too has the science focus for prospective antarctic facilities of this scale changed as this has occurred .",
    "it has narrowed into the parameter space where modest antarctic facilities may still compete with the best facilities available elsewhere  that science which requires wide - field , high spatial resolution imaging in the near - infrared and ( spectroscopically ) the mid - infrared .",
    "this science is still impressive , however , even for a modest - size telescope .",
    "it includes such projects as searching for the first light in the universe via pair - instability supernovae and from ir - only emitting gamma - ray bursts , as well as deep 2.4@xmath3 m imaging surveys looking for the first galaxies to evolve in the universe .",
    "exo - planet searches would also be well facilitated , carried out both through the transit technique and through micro - lensing .",
    "it would also be possible to image the warm molecular gas of the galaxy directly , on the arcsecond scale , as opposed to the arcminute scale available in the millimetre , by measuring the 17@xmath3 m line of molecular hydrogen , the ortho - ground state transition of the molecule which is sensitive to this environment .",
    "no antarctic telescope has been funded yet that could undertake any of these investigations , though several have been proposed as we discuss further in   [ sec : future ] ( e.g.  airo at the south pole , pilot / plt at dome c and kdust at dome a ) .      even at the best temperate latitude sites such as the chajnantor plateau in chile",
    "there is only occasional access to the thz windows . only from antarctica",
    "could substantive thz surveys be considered , other than from space .",
    "two of the most important cooling lines in the dense interstellar medium emit in the thz regime ; [ cii ] at 1.9  thz ( 158@xmath3 m ) and [ nii ] at 1.5  thz ( 205@xmath3 m ) .",
    "these lines provide tools to probe the formation and life - cycle of interstellar clouds .",
    "a thz telescope has been funded for antarctica , the 0.8 m stratospheric thz observatory ( sto ; walker et al .",
    "this is to be flown from a long duration balloon scheduled for launch from mcmurdo in the 2010/11 austral summer .",
    "sto aims to survey @xmath91 of the galactic plane for emission from these species , with a spatial scale of @xmath92 .",
    "further ahead , there are plans for much larger thz facilities at domes a and f , capable of extending observations to extra - galactic sources .",
    "the estimates made for the thz transparency ( yang et al .",
    "2010 ) at dome a suggest that the [ nii ] line could be measured there , with @xmath93% transmission , for a quarter of the time . at ridge",
    "a these same estimates suggest that even the [ cii ] line will be accessible , for perhaps 10% of the time .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope dominates the logistics of supporting the south pole station . completing this facility so that it can go into full operation is a priority for the next few years .",
    "the existing cmbr facilities at pole will continue to operate , building their data sets over several years so as to be able to address their science goals , as outlined in ",
    "[ sec : cmbr ] .",
    "this includes the quad experiment on dasi ( e  mode polarization mapping ) , bicep ( b  mode detection ) and the spt ( sz - effect in distant galaxy clusters ) .",
    "once this last survey is completed , the plans for the spt are to use it for conventional sub - millimetre astronomy , building upon programs started with the ast / ro telescope .",
    "spt will be capable of undertaking surveys at the highest frequencies reached by alma , as well as conducting thz observations when conditions permit . while a 2 m class infrared telescope was once proposed for the south pole ( airo ; jackson 2001 ) , this was before the first measurements of seeing were obtained from dome c. an infrared telescope is not currently on the agenda for the south pole .",
    "on the other hand , a 2 m optical / uv telescope , acwi  the antarctic cosmic web imager  is being developed .",
    "this will be used to search for red - shifted uv resonant line emission ( ly@xmath94 121.6 nm , civ 155 nm & ovi 103 nm ; moore et al .",
    "2008b ) from the intergalactic medium at @xmath95 , in order to study large - scale structure and the dark matter distribution ( i.e.  the cosmic web ) .",
    "the technical driver is the extremely accurate sky subtraction that should be attainable due to the combination of low extinction ( resulting from the low aerosols ) and long duration observations at constant zenith angle , so minimising instrumental systematics ( high image quality is not required for this application ) .",
    "astronomical activity at dome c to date has consisted of site testing and several small - scale prototype facilities , that will culminate with the operation of the 80 cm mid - infrared irait telescope .",
    "consideration of future plans for facilities at concordia station has been conducted under the auspices of the european union - funded arena consortium , a network program run from 2006 - 09 .",
    "each of the three yearly conferences resulted in a book summarising the deliberations over the previous year , evolving as knowledge of the site conditions and technical challenges grew ( epchtein & candidi 2007 , zinnecker , epchtein & rauer 2008 , spinoglio & epchtein 2010 ) . arena finished its activities by producing a roadmap for future development at dome c ( epchtein et al .",
    "this was organised through 6 working groups , who considered the prospects at dome c for infrared , sub - millimetre , interferometric , time - series , cmbr and solar science , respectively .",
    "arena see the development of a 2 m class , wide - field infrared telescope as the next stage in the development of dome c ( see burton et al .",
    "2010 ) , such as that based on the design study conducted for the pilot / plt telescope ( see storey et al .  2007 , saunders et al.2008a , 2008b ) .",
    "funding is being sought for a phase b study for this concept , before construction could start .",
    "dome c is clearly an excellent site for many photometric monitoring experiments , for sub - millimetre and solar telescopes , for cmbr measurements and for infrared interferometers .",
    "the arena roadmap considers a staged development of concordia station to support all these types of facilities .",
    "although the construction of kunlun station at dome a has only recently begun , china has drawn up plans for several major astronomical facilities , under the auspices of the chinese center for antarctic astronomy ( gong et al .",
    "2010 , cui 2010 ) .",
    "these include a three telescope array of 0.5 m schmidt telescopes ( ast3 ) to search for transiting exo - planets and obtain light curves of supernovae , a 4 m infrared telescope ( kdust ; zhao et al .",
    "2010 ) to search for distant supernovae and distant galaxies , and a 10m+ diameter sub - mm / thz telescope . a further automated observatory ( plato  a ) , with increased power capacity ,",
    "is also planned for dome a.      while site testing at dome f has barely commenced , it is clear the site will also be exceptional for observational astronomy .",
    "site testing is envisaged to continue , making use of another plato - style automated observatory , as at dome a. two prototype projects are under construction for future deployment there , a 40 cm infrared and a 30 cm thz telescope ( ichikawa 2010 ) .",
    "two facilities have been proposed after this , an ultra light weight 2.5 m infrared telescope ( takato et al .",
    "2008 ) and a 10 m class thz telescope .",
    "the infrared telescope would undertake deep surveys for galaxies at 2.4@xmath3 m , and the thz facility examine dusty galaxies to study galaxy evolution at high redshift .      as argued by saunders et al .",
    "( 2009 ) this may be the best site on the planet for thz astronomy .",
    "no stations are as yet envisaged for ridge a , however , nor are any overland traverses planned to the site .",
    "site quantification may have to take place through twin otter deployment of an automated observatory , such as using a modified , light - weighted version of the plato module .",
    "antarctica is a land of extremes .",
    "descriptors such as coldest , driest , highest , windiest and calmest can all be applied to the continent .",
    "it is barely a century since the first explorers ventured into the interior .",
    "the antarctic plateau has been found to provide the pre - eminent conditions for making many kinds of astronomical observations from the earth .",
    "antarctica remains a challenging place to work , but technology now provides for ready access to the interior of the continent , as well as for sophisticated scientific experiments to be carried out .",
    "human perceptions of the continent have not , however , caught up with recent accomplishments in antarctica .",
    "while the ` heroic age ' of antarctic exploration is long over , it still stirs the imagination when people think about antarctica .",
    "paradoxically , this has also limited our ability to fully exploit the unique conditions to conduct front - line science , as much of our thinking is mired by pre - conceptions gleaned from the survival tales of the heroic age .",
    "this has limited the ability of many nations to grasp the new opportunities now available . overcoming human perceptions about the environment of the antarctic plateau is proving to be at least as difficult as developing the new front line facilities themselves . with the start of the third millennium , and a growing knowledge and awareness of antarctica",
    ", such perceptions are waning .",
    "the challenge for the astronomer now is to work out how to grasp the opportunity , to conduct science that might otherwise only be tackled from space .",
    "the antarctic plateau provides sites where the ultimate earth - based telescopes may be built , if we can find the way to build on the pioneering endeavours of the past two decades , and establish the necessary infrastructure development that can lead to new astronomical facilities .",
    "astronomy in antarctica has provided a peripatetic journey for me for nearly two decades , one with its full share of successes and failures , of amazing highs and deep lows , but always with a sense of discovery at the frontier .",
    "a great many people have provided inspiration and support along the way , on a path that has now found me trying to tell the factual story behind a new field of scientific endeavour in this review article .",
    "david allen , peter gillingham and russell cannon each encouraged my youthful enthusiasm in the infant field while i worked at the anglo australian observatory and john storey gave me the opportunity to take my first steps in antarctica with a job at unsw .",
    "together with michael ashley , the three of us stumbled through some early adventures at the south pole .",
    "al harper and john bally , and later john carlstrom , made possible our participation in the early years of the cara venture there , and this gave us the springboard to take our program to the high plateau .",
    "our group has waxed and waned over the years , dictated by the vagaries of university funding , but with jon lawrence s joining our program managed to wind its way forward , from the pole to dome c , then dome a and now towards dome f , with even ridge a now in our sights .",
    "all these colleagues have contributed immeasurably to astronomy in antarctica and many of the scientific highlights reported here .",
    "so too have our many support staff , postdoctoral fellows and research students , at unsw , the aao and other places around australia .",
    "several somehow managed to winter - over in antarctica along the way , an opportunity i missed in my youth !",
    "marc duldig has provided invaluable insight into the mysterious workings of the antarctic establishment .",
    "our continually growing list of international colleagues , first in the usa , then france and italy , extending around the european union through the arena network , and now to china and japan , are all contributing to the vitality of this field and the science that has been accomplished , as well as that which may one day be possible .",
    "the referee , roland gredel , also provided insightful comments and corrected several errors . but none of this would have happened for me without the support and understanding of my dear wife connie , who could not have imagined what the past twenty years could possibly bring and where it would lead us to .",

    "<S> antarctica provides a unique environment for astronomers to practice their trade . </S>",
    "<S> the cold , dry and stable air found above the high antarctic plateau , as well as the pure ice below , offers new opportunities for the conduct of observational astronomy across both the photon and the particle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the summits of the antarctic plateau provide the best seeing conditions , the darkest skies and the most transparent atmosphere of any earth - based observing site . </S>",
    "<S> astronomical activities are now underway at four plateau sites : the amundsen - scott south pole station , concordia station at dome c , kunlun station at dome a and fuji station at dome f , in addition to long duration ballooning from the coastal station of mcmurdo , at stations run by the usa , france / italy , china , japan and the usa , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the astronomy conducted from antarctica includes optical , infrared , terahertz and sub - millimetre astronomy , measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , solar astronomy , as well as high energy astrophysics involving the measurement of cosmic rays , gamma rays and neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> antarctica is also the richest source of meteorites on our planet .    </S>",
    "<S> an extensive range of site testing measurements have been made over the high plateau sites . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we summarise the facets of antarctica that are driving developments in astronomy there , and review the results of the site testing experiments undertaken to quantify those characteristics of the antarctic plateau relevant for astronomical observation . </S>",
    "<S> we also outline the historical development of the astronomy on the continent , and then review the principal scientific results to have emerged over the past three decades of activity in the discipline . these range from determination of the dominant frequencies of the 5 minute solar oscillation in 1979 to the highest angular scale measurements yet made of the power spectrum of the cmbr anisotropies in 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> they span through infrared views of the galactic ecology in star formation complexes in 1999 , the first clear demonstration that the universe was flat in 2000 , the first detection of polarization in the cmbr in 2002 , the mapping of the warm molecular gas across the @xmath0pc extent of the central molecular zone of our galaxy in 2003 , the measurement of cosmic neutrinos in 2005 , and imaging of the thermal sunyaev zeldovich effect in galaxy clusters in 2008 .    </S>",
    "<S> this review also discusses how science is conducted in antarctica , and in particular the difficulties , as well as the advantages , faced by astronomers seeking to bring their experiments there . </S>",
    "<S> it also reviews some of the political issues that will be encountered , both at national and international level . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the review discusses where antarctic astronomy may be heading in the coming decade , in particular plans for infrared and terahertz astronomy , including the new facilities being considered for these wavebands at the high plateau stations . </S>"
