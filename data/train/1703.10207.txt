    "in this paper we are discussing a multiparticle cotunneling mechanism of conductivity in a granular metal with flexible charges , randomly placed in the insulating matrix .",
    "the flexibility of disorder gives rise to a sort of `` random polaronic effect '' , which dramatically affects the temperature dependence of conductivity .",
    "a study of this subject requires a combination of different physical concepts and methods , so we start from a brief review of the necessary ingredients .",
    "the stretched - exponential temperature dependence of conductivity @xmath0 is characteristic of variable range hopping ( vrh ) in homogeneously disordered materials ( such as amorphous solids @xcite or doped semiconductors @xcite ) at low temperatures . in the case when the long - range interactions do not play any significant role , the exponent @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the space dimensionality ) , @xmath3^{-1}$ ] ( where @xmath4 is the density of states at the fermi level and @xmath5 is the inverse decrement of electronic wave - functions ) , and the corresponding dependence is known as the mott law @xcite . in the opposite case , when the long range coulomb interaction is crucial and gives rise to the soft coulomb gap in the electronic density of states @xcite , the exponent @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the dielectric constant ) and this dependence is known as the efros - shklovskii law .      a similar behaviour of conductivity was also observed in arrays of metallic and semiconducting quantum dots in the temperature range 1  200k ( see reviews @xcite and some old @xcite and more recent @xcite experimental papers ) .",
    "an explanation of the stretched - exponential @xmath9-dependence of conductivity in granular materials attracted interest of theorists .",
    "many of early theories @xcite were based on special assumptions about the distribution of the random parameters of grains ( sizes etc ) and were criticised ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , because of their _ ad hoc _ character and the lack of universality . some other theories @xcite correctly indicated the important role of sequential tunneling of electrons through a chain of intermediate grains , but did not give a correct multi - particle description for this tunneling and a valid recipe for evaluation of the tunneling amplitude .",
    "such a prescription was worked out in @xcite , where the simple idea , introduced in @xcite , was generalised to take into account both multi - particle character ( i.e. , the cotunneling , see @xcite ) of the process and coulomb effects .",
    "in contrast with the standard single - particle - like vrh scenario , where a particle would travel from one end of the chain to the other , consequently hopping through all intermediate grains , the multiple cotunneling scenario , developed in @xcite involves all possible sequences of hops between neighbouring grains in the chain . in general ,",
    "these hops are executed by different electrons ; the intermediate states of the process involve many grains with altered charges .",
    "however , upon the completion of the process there is only one net electron that is transferred between the terminal grains of the chain , while the charges of all intermediate grains return to their initial values .",
    "it does not mean that all the processes with different sequences of hops lead to the same final state of the system : the final states of some grains may be identical to the initial ones ( elastic cotunneling ) , while for other grains the initial and final states may differ by an electron - hole pair ( inelastic cotunneling ) . as a result ( see @xcite for details ) , the law is reproduced with @xmath10 where @xmath11 and the coulomb charging energy is @xmath12 , @xmath13 being typical capacitance in the system of grains .",
    "a typical level spacing in a grain @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the grains size , and @xmath16 is the typical dimensionless conductance between adjacent grains .",
    "note that the logarithmic factor @xmath17 is large .",
    "the crossover between the elastic and inelastic cotunneling regimes takes place at @xmath18 thus , the stretched exponential law in the case of granular materials is slightly modified in the intermediate temperature range ( @xmath19 ) due to additional logarithmic @xmath9-dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "this deviation from the mott - efros - shklovskii law is , however , not easy to detect experimentally .",
    "it is well known that at relatively high temperatures the vrh is not operative , it is changed to the nearest neighbour hopping ( nnh ) , so that the stretched - exponential law is replaced by the arrhenius law for conductivity @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what is much less trivial , in some cases @xcite the reentrance of the arrhenius law @xmath22 is observed also at _ low _ temperatures !",
    "this reentrance is usually attributed to polaronic effect : a `` hard gap '' @xmath23 is supposed to be related to the energy , necessary for the creation in advance of a polaronic cloud , that then will accommodate a hopping electron at a new position .    in principle",
    ", the hopping electron can take along the necessary energy while hopping from the initial position to the new one , therefore at still lower temperatures the activational mechanism of polaron hopping is substituted by the tunneling one ( see @xcite ) and the stretched exponential law is again restored at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the characteristic frequency of phonons ( or some other species  magnons , localised electronic excitations etc ) , that constitute the polaronic cloud .",
    "the case of magnetic polarons is special : due to the local conservation of the magnetisation the process of the tunneling transfer of the polaronic cloud is strongly suppressed @xcite , and the classical - quantum crossover is shifted from @xmath26 to much lower temperatures .",
    "it explains why the hard gap phenomenon was experimentally observed predominantly ( but not exclusively ! ) in magnetic systems . in general , the theory of vrh with account for polaronic effect was developed in @xcite for different types of polarons .",
    "it is important that , if the strength of the polaronic effect randomly varies from place to place , then it does nt necessarily have to lead to the activation arrhenius law .",
    "if the distribution of barrier heights has a power - law tail at zero , one can expect the dependence with @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , for homogeneously disordered solids it was shown in @xcite that , if the barrier distribution is constant in the vicinity of zero , the mott conductivity should have the exponent @xmath28 .",
    "the onset of arrhenius - like behaviour of conductivity at low temperatures in granular materials is reported far less often .",
    "for example , in experiments @xcite the arrhenius behaviour was observed below @xmath29 in two - dimensional arrays of semiconducting ge / si quantum dots . above that temperature",
    "the conductivity followed efros - shklovskii law . in paper",
    "@xcite the observation of `` almost '' arrhenius conductivity was reported in the temperature range @xmath30 in the array of metallic co nanoparticles .",
    "this dependence was well described by with @xmath31 . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath32 efros - shklovskii law was found .",
    "there are also experiments @xcite in which @xmath33 was observed in the broad temperature range @xmath34 in the arrays of zno nanocrystals .",
    "it is tempting to attribute these findings to some kind of random polaronic effect .",
    "but what does the polaron effect mean in the case , where we deal not with single charge carriers , but with grains , containing many electrons ? and what are the effective degrees of freedom that constitute here a polaronic cloud ? as to our knowledge ,",
    "no models of the polaronic effect in granular systems have been discussed so far . in this paper",
    "we introduce such a model for metallic grains and study its implications for the transport properties within the framework of multiple cotunnelling concept .",
    "the article is organized in the following way .",
    "we discuss the basic concepts of our model in sections [ model ] and [ short range interaction case ] .",
    "the detailed calculation of electron transition rate between the pair of distant resonant grains in the case of short - range interaction is carried out in sections [ transition rates]-[physical explanation ] .",
    "we deal with different parameter ranges and also provide physical interpretation of results . based on these findings",
    "we analyse the temperature behaviour of conductivity in sections [ conductivity ] and [ conductivity in different temperature ranges ] .",
    "section [ summary ] contains the summary of our results and in section [ conclusion ] we discuss the limitations and possible future directions of research .",
    "the main source of disorder in granular systems is the `` stray charges ''  hardly removable charged impurities and defects , trapped in the insulating part of the system , see fig .",
    "[ grainss ] .",
    "they produce random coulomb fields acting on the grains , so that the coulomb energy of the system is @xmath35 where we have introduced vectorial notation @xmath36 here integer @xmath37 denotes a number of excess electrons on @xmath38-th grain , @xmath39 is the inverse matrix of capacitances , and the components @xmath40 of the vector @xmath41 are the so called `` offset charges '' ( not necessarily integers ! ) .",
    "it should be noted that each offset charge @xmath40 can not be identified with certain unique impurity : all impurities that effectively interact with a given grain @xmath38 contribute to @xmath40 .",
    "vice versa , each impurity may effectively contribute to many different variables @xmath40 .        in the context of vrh",
    "the offset charges are usually treated as static random variables , but in this paper we are going to take into account their dynamics . indeed , @xmath40",
    "depend on the positions of the charged impurities , that are not absolutely rigid , but can deviate from their equilibrium places . in the harmonic approximation",
    "these deviations are governed by the hamiltonian @xmath42 , @xmath43 where the positively defined matrix of effective masses @xmath44 is related to the masses of impurities .",
    "the vector @xmath45 describes the set of equilibrium values of offset charges for the case of neutral grains : @xmath46 .",
    "the matrix @xmath47 in is related to the stiffness of the system with respect to displacements of the charged impurities .",
    "it contains both the `` mechanical '' part ( due to deformation of surrounding medium ) and the `` electrostatic '' part ( the variation of the electrostatic energy of grains due to the displacement of impurities ) .",
    "the second part depends on the set @xmath48 ; namely , since @xmath49 is linearly related to the second derivative of the energy with respect to the coordinates of impurities , @xmath47 should be a quadratic polynomial in @xmath48 : @xmath50 the mechanical part contributes only to the first , @xmath51-independent , term in .",
    "therefore , in the most natural case , when the mechanical stiffness dominates over the electrostatic one , the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath47 can be neglected . anyway , even if the electrostatic part of @xmath47 is considerable , at low temperatures it seems reasonable to ignore the `` live '' @xmath48-dependence of @xmath47 , and replace the function @xmath49 by its equilibrium value @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the charges , that the grains acquire at the equilibrium",
    ".      since the effective masses are large , in the leading approximation the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian can be neglected , and the ground state of the system corresponds to the minimum of the total potential energy of the system of charges @xmath54 minimising with respect to @xmath41 at fixed @xmath48 , we get @xmath55 where the symmetric matrix @xmath56 has a meaning of the inverse capacitance matrix , renormalised due to the effects of finite elasticity of the system .    for the stability of the system s ground state the matrix @xmath57 must be positively defined",
    ". a violation of this requirement would mean that we have incorrectly chosen the ground state set @xmath53 , which turned out to be unstable ; the system eventually will move to a different state , where the stability will be restored due to nonlinearity of the problem , expressed in the @xmath58 dependence .",
    "further minimisation of with respect to @xmath48 gives the equilibrium values of charges as integers , closest ( in a sense , see below ) to @xmath59 . as a result @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the set of `` effective residual offset charges '' .",
    "note , that in the case of rigid impurities ( when @xmath62 ) @xmath63 , and the effective offset charges are reduced to the standard ones : @xmath64 noninteger part of @xmath45    the common restriction , usually imposed on the residual offset charges , reads @xmath65 strictly speaking , this is not correct in general case : for symmetric matrix @xmath57 the all - integer-@xmath48 minimum of the energy functional may , in principle , lay quite far from the unrestricted one , so that some components of @xmath61 may be quite large .",
    "examples are easy to produce ( say , a highly anisotropic potential profile with valleys , looking in low - symmetry directions ) but all these examples seem to be exotic , if not pathological . at least we were not able to construct any physically relevant matrix @xmath57 for that the restriction would be violated .",
    "anyway , it is definitely valid for the case which we are going to study in detail below : the screened coulomb interaction with diagonal matrix @xmath57 . therefore , in what follows we will consider the restriction granted .      at low temperatures both the grains charges @xmath48 and the offset charges @xmath41 only slightly deviate from the equilibrium values , so one can write @xmath66 where @xmath67 may take values @xmath68 .",
    "now we are prepared to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of deviations @xmath69 and @xmath70 . substituting into and omitting the terms ,",
    "that do not contain deviations , we get @xmath71      besides the ground state , the low - lying excited states are of great importance for the transport properties of the system . for the state @xmath69 the thermodynamic ( i.e. , minimized with respect to @xmath70 ) excitation energy is @xmath72",
    "different branches of spectrum can be visualized as multi - dimensional paraboloids in the @xmath70-space .",
    "the paraboloids are indexed by vector @xmath69 .",
    "excitation energy @xmath73 is nothing else , but the energetic distance between the bottom of corresponding paraboloid and the global ground state energy , see fig.[paraboloid ] . for brevity",
    "we have denoted @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the paraboloids are indexed by vector @xmath69 .",
    "zero - energy level corresponds to the classical ground state .",
    "the activation energy @xmath76 for transition @xmath77 is given by . ]      below we will obtain some crucial characteristics of single - particle excited states , in which only one entry @xmath67 in @xmath69 is nonzero , while all other entries are zeroes ( namely , @xmath78 where @xmath79_m=\\delta_{km}$ ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamic excitation energies @xmath80 correspond to variation of the `` relaxed '' energy due to creation ( annihilation ) of one electron at grain @xmath81 . by definition , the inequality @xmath82 should hold for all @xmath81 , which is ensured by . in granular systems",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath83 that has the meaning of the energy of `` charged ground state '' , counted from the global ground state of the grain .",
    "density of such states is sometimes called the density of ground states ( dogs ) in the literature  see @xcite for more details .",
    "as we will see soon , another useful combination that enters the activation exponent of the conductance between two distant grains @xmath84 ( by agreement `` left '' ) and @xmath85 ( by agreement `` right '' ) is @xmath86 note that it has a conventional analogue in the standard hopping conductivity theory @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will assume that electronic transitions proceed very fast , so that the slow variables @xmath70 do not have time to change during the process  the franck - condon principle ( see more discussion on this topic in section [ fc principle ] ) .",
    "thus we introduce additional franck - condon excitation energies @xmath87      there are four classes of possible two - particle processes , corresponding to an act of the charge @xmath88 transfer from grain @xmath84 to grain @xmath85 , see fig",
    ". [ processes ] .",
    "a.   ( @xmath89 process ) : transfer of an electron - type single - particle excitation from @xmath84 to @xmath85 : @xmath90 ; b.   ( @xmath91 process ) : transfer of a hole - type single - particle excitation from @xmath85 to @xmath84 : @xmath92 ; c.   ( @xmath93 process ) : annihilation a two - particle excitation , consisting of an electron - type excitation in grain @xmath84 and a hole - type one in grain @xmath85 : @xmath94 ; d.   ( @xmath95 process ) : creation of a two - particle excitation , consisting of an electron - type excitation in grain @xmath85 and a hole - type one in grain @xmath84 : @xmath96 ;     transfer from grain @xmath84 to grain @xmath85 . ]    while in the first two processes only single - particle excitations are involved , in the third and fourth ones the two - particle complexes ( intergrain electron - hole pairs ) are created or annihilated . because of generally long - range character of interaction matrix @xmath57 the components of two - particle excitations interact with each other , so that their energies generally are not additive .",
    "thermodynamic excitation energies for the two - particle excitations can be obtained from : @xmath97 and the franck - condon energies are @xmath98    we will see in section [ short range interaction case ] that the interaction parts in and vanish in the case of short - range interaction .      a very important role in low temperature physics is played by the resonant grains , for which either @xmath99 or @xmath100 is anomalously close to zero .",
    "the transition between such resonant states @xmath101 and @xmath102 requires , however , a considerable change of the surrounding ( i.e. , the vector @xmath70 ) , which can only be done continuously .",
    "in the course of this change the potential energy of the system also changes  first increases , then decreases , so that the system has to overcome the potential barrier .",
    "this can be accomplished either by means of activation over the barrier , or by tunneling . for both processes",
    "the height of the barrier @xmath103 is crucial . to find it we should minimise the energy @xmath104 over @xmath70 with additional condition @xmath105 , implying that the states are resonant .",
    "the result is @xmath106 note that @xmath103 depends only on the difference @xmath107 between the final and initial states .",
    "in particular , it is the same for all kinds of processes described in section [ two - particle excitations ] .",
    "we can also find the activation energy @xmath76 for a transition between arbitrary ( not necessarily resonant ) states @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "the thermodynamic and franck - condon excitation energies for this model are @xmath122",
    "as we know from @xcite , the main features of variable - range hopping in granular systems can be revealed already in the simplest model of short range coulomb interaction , described in section [ short range interaction case ] , so in this paper we restrict our consideration to this model .",
    "we will also ignore the quantum aspects of the offset charges dynamics ( i.e. , put @xmath123 ) .",
    "in particular , the last assumption means that we can use the franck - condon principle in the calculation of transition rates . according to this principle ,",
    "the set @xmath70 remains unchanged on the cotunneling time scale @xmath124 .",
    "we should calculate the transition rates @xmath125 between relevant grains at fixed configuration of @xmath70 and only afterwards perform the thermodynamic averaging of the result with respect to @xmath70 .",
    "the cotunneling time @xmath126 can be roughly estimated as the inverse scale of energetic denominators appearing in the perturbation theory @xmath127 on the other hand , characteristic time scale @xmath128 for the dynamics of @xmath70 is nothing but the inverse frequency of the impurity oscillations @xmath129 , which apparently should be of the order of phonon frequencies @xmath130 . as a result ,",

    "thus , the condition can not be considered automarically fulfilled , the opposite case is well probable . however , as we already noted , we are going to neglect the kinetic term for @xmath70 in the hamiltonian , which means that @xmath70 can overcome potential barriers only by activation , and not by tunneling .",
    "this implies even more stringent condition @xmath135 that we will consider granted throughout this paper .      under the above approximations",
    ", the hamiltonian of the system may be written in the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 is given by expression , and @xmath138 is the hamiltonian of electrons within the @xmath38-th grain .",

    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath144 describes the hops of electrons between neighbouring grains @xmath145 .",
    "we are interested in the case , when the typical dimensionless intergrain conductances @xmath146 are small , and the tunneling hamiltonian may be treated perturbatively ; the necessary order of the perturbation theory , however , appears to be high  the lower the temperature , the higher the order !    the principal idea of any vrh - type calculation is the famous observation of mott @xcite : at low temperatures hopping electrons prefer to visit only resonant sites ( in our case for sites stand the grains ) , where their energies are confined to a narrow strip of width @xmath147 near the fermi energy .",
    "decreasing @xmath147 loosens the factor @xmath148 that suppresses the conductivity due to small number of available excitations . on the other hand",
    "the resonant sites are rare ( the typical distance @xmath149 between them grows with decreasing @xmath147 ) , so that the overlap of corresponding wave - functions @xmath150 is small : @xmath151 and this small factor becomes still smaller with decreasing @xmath147 .",

    "is somewhat modified , but the main idea remains the same .    while in case of single electron tunneling evaluation of the overlap exponential factor @xmath150 is straightforward , and @xmath5 is simply related to the decrement of electronic wave - function , in the case of metallic grains the origin of the exponential dependence and explicit form of @xmath5 is more sophisticated . in this section",
    "we will explore this problem , incorporating the additional physics that arises from the effects of the stray - charges flexibility .",

    "the flexibility of the system of impurities leads to a `` polaronic effect '' , that can be either weak ( for @xmath445 ) or strong ( for @xmath446 ) , where the crossover temperature @xmath447 and @xmath448 is given by below .    in this paper",
    "we have studied a model with short range interaction ( e.g. , screened coulomb ) and taken into account only the thermoactivational mechanism of the penetration of the polaronic barrier by the configurational degrees of freedom , not the tunneling one .",
    "the latter may become relevant at very low temperatures ( the larger the effective mass @xmath449 of the impurities , the lower the corresponding crossover temperature ) .",
    "experimentalists often introduce the differential activation energy according to @xmath450 below we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath451 in different temperature ranges",
    ".      in the range @xmath445 the hopping can be with minor modifications described by the electronic multiple cotunneling @xcite @xmath452      the range @xmath446 , where the cotunneling is dominated by polaronic effect , is split into two subranges with the crossover temperature @xmath453    * for @xmath410 the spatial fluctuations of polaronic barriers @xmath358 can be neglected and the choice of resonant grains that constitute the effectively conducting network is dictated exclusively by the values of @xmath357 : they should lie in the mott - like strip @xmath454 , while the particular values of @xmath358 are irrelevant . here",
    "the approach , similar to the one , proposed in @xcite , is applicable , and @xmath455 where the second term is relatively small , compared to the first one . * for @xmath456 both @xmath357 and @xmath358 are important , the effective network is formed by the grains for which both @xmath357 and @xmath358 are anomalously small : @xmath454 and simultaneously @xmath457 .",

    "the above mentioned crossovers discriminate different modes of hopping with respect to the strength of polaronic effect ( crossover at @xmath460 ) and to the importance of the fluctuations of the latter ( crossover at @xmath461 ) .",
    "there is , however , one additional crossover at @xmath462 that discriminates different modes with respect to the character of cotunneling : elasic or inelastic . for @xmath463 the `` constants '' @xmath464 and @xmath465 logarithmically increase with the lowering of temperature ,",
    "while at @xmath466 they saturate and become @xmath9-independent : @xmath467 @xmath468 the explicit form of @xmath469 depends on the relation between @xmath469 and @xmath470 : @xmath471    for @xmath472 the crossover between elastic and inelastic cotunneling takes place within the weak polaron effect domain , while for @xmath473 it happens within the strong polaron effect domain .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a concept of polaronic effect in granular systems , related to the flexibility of the random charges , trapped in the insulating matrix .",
    "we have explained , how this effect is manifested in the conductivity of the system , the latter being controlled by multiple cotunneling of electrons through long `` strings '' of adjacent grains .",
    "the basic line of our reasoning was similar to that of every vrh - like calculation , and could be split into two basic steps :    \\(i ) we calculate the carrier transition rate between distant resonant sites , taking into account all the necessary physics ( the cotunneling and coupling to flexible impurities ) .",
    "the transition rate is given by the expression and its simplifications and .",
    "\\(ii ) afterwards , we find the conductivity of miller - abrahams network of conductances with the help of percolation theory .",
    "we distinguish two important temperature ranges , namely @xmath474 ( electron hopping ) and @xmath475 ( polaron hopping ) , which differ in both physical characteristics of transport and @xmath9-dependence of conductivity .",
    "besides the crossover between electron and polaron hopping we have also studied another crossover  between elastic and inelastic cotunneling regimes .",
    "it takes place at the temperature @xmath476 , given by . in the presence of strong polaronic effect",
    "this temperature turns out to be the same as for single quantum dot , in contrast with the electron hopping regime , where it is much lower .",
    "a few important questions remain open and are subject to future research .",
    "\\(i ) in the present work we have treated the configurational degrees of freedom ( i.e. , coordinates of the charged impurities ) as classic ones .",
    "this can be justified only if the temperature @xmath9 is higher than characteristic frequencies @xmath477 of the impurities vibrations ; at lower @xmath9 the polaronic barriers would be penetrated by means of quantum tunneling . in principle",
    ", it should lead to the reentrance of mott law at @xmath478 .",
    "however , since @xmath477 may be different for different impurities , the crossover to tunneling may occur not simultaneously at all grains , and that may give rise to some interesting new physics .",
    "\\(ii ) we have studied here only the case of short range interactions .",
    "some qualitative ideas about the effects of the long range coulomb interactions for the electron hopping were presented in @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the lack of experimental data on polaron effect in granular systems does not allow to reliably choose the distribution function of the polaronic barriers @xmath103 .",
    "it is not clear whether it should be wide or narrow , have a power - law tail at @xmath248 or exponential one .",
    "\\(iv ) it is also unclear if the present model , in which the occupation numbers @xmath479 are coupled to oscillators , is adequate for real world applications .",
    "another possible option would be the coupling to the tunneling two - level systems ( ttls , see @xcite ) .",
    "physically the two - level system may be represented by impurity atoms that can tunnel between two adjacent potential wells .",
    "such systems play important role in physics of glasses , they also contribute to dephasing in qubits @xcite .",
    "we believe that the formalism developed in this paper will allow us to answer at least the first question from the list above . as for the other questions ,",
    "some novel approaches may be required .",
    "we are indebted to m.v.feigelman and l.b.ioffe for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by 5top100 grant of russian ministry of education and science .",
    "we are interested in the low-@xmath9 behaviour of the system , when the critical subnetwork , responsible for the conductivity , is comprised of the rare grains with anomalously small @xmath398 and anomalously low barriers @xmath358 from the tail of the distribution .",
    "as we will see later , these parameters are confined in narrow strips @xmath480 now we will adopt the inequalities as a conjecture , the real values of @xmath481 will be determined later , and these values will justify .    based on the assumption , the expression for @xmath482 can be expanded and we get @xmath483 the result means that indeed each site may be characterised by one `` composite colour '' @xmath484 not by two independent colours @xmath398 and @xmath358 .",
    "the density of this composite colour is @xmath485 ( the factor 2 arises due to symmetry @xmath486 ) , and @xmath487 now we introduce dimensionless variables @xmath488 and arrive at the dimensionless percolation problem @xmath489 with the density in the @xmath490-space @xmath491d\\epsilon\\approx\\nonumber\\\\ \\approx   \\frac{4\\beta't}{t'_m}(\\xi /2)^{d+1}\\phi\\left[\\frac{\\overline{w}-\\xi",
    "t\\left(\\frac12-\\delta\\right)}{\\delta w}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath492 in particular , we will need the asymptotics @xmath493 it is convenient to write @xmath494 and note that @xmath495 and @xmath496 , so that @xmath497 as we will see soon , for typical @xmath215 and @xmath498 a hierarchy @xmath499 holds .",
    "therefore only the first two terms in the exponent should be kept , while last term is much less than unity and can be neglected . as a result",
    ", we can rewrite in a form @xmath500    after the renormalisation of variables @xmath501 we arrive at the universal percolation problem , where the sites of colour @xmath502 are randomly distributed with the density @xmath503 while the percolation criterion reads @xmath504 note that this problem is characterised by single constant @xmath505 and therefore the percolation should be established at @xmath506 where @xmath507 is some universal constant , depending only on the space dimensionality @xmath2 .",
