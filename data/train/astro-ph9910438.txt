    "the discovery @xcite that many galaxy clusters are also strong sources of x - rays opened a new window on cosmology which has proved fruitful for nearly three decades .",
    "subsequent investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) determined that this emission originates in a hot ( @xmath7 ) thermal plasma with electron number densities of @xmath8 .",
    "since the sound - crossing time for pressure waves in this plasma is less than the hubble time , the plasma can be assumed to accurately trace the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "cluster virial masses obtained in this manner , in conjunction with intracluster medium ( icm ) models derived from einstein and rosat observations , have shown an overdensity of baryons relative to the expectation for an @xmath9 , big bang nucleosynthesis universe @xcite , thus providing a powerful challenge to the cosmological orthodoxy .    the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons known as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze) provides another direct probe of the icm .",
    "as first indicated by @xcite , the combination of x - ray and sze measurements on a given cluster yield a _",
    "direct _ measurement of the distance to the cluster .",
    "if the thermal sze decrement predicted by the x - ray data under the assumption @xmath10 is @xmath11 , and the observed decrement is @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 such a calculation requires knowledge of the structure of the cluster along the line of sight ; since the x - ray data do not directly provide such information , the clusters are typically assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "it then becomes important to select clusters from an orientation - unbiased sample .",
    "since the error in @xmath6 is twice the error in @xmath11 , it is also important to accurately understand the statistical and systematic uncertainties inherent in the x - ray models .",
    "the objective of the penn / ovro sze survey is to determine @xmath6 from observations of the sze in an x - ray flux - limited sample of nearby clusters .",
    "the ovro 5.5-meter telescope is an ideal instrument for this purpose . at 32 ghz",
    ", this telescope has a primary beam of @xmath15 ( fwhm ) and a dual - horn switching angle of @xmath16 . at the mean redshift of our sample , these correspond to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "since the gas in clusters is distributed on a scale @xmath19 , and most of the gas is contained within the inner @xmath20 , the 5.5-meter main beam samples an astrophysically relevant scale while the switching only removes @xmath21 of the signal .",
    "the first results from this survey were reported in @xcite : with sze measurements of four clusters ( coma , abell 478 , abell 2142 , and abell 2256 ) and x - ray models from the literature , myers et al .",
    "find @xmath22 .",
    "the accuracy of these results is limited primarily by the x - ray models .    with this in mind",
    ", we have undertaken to expand the sample of myers et al . and , using public x - ray data , construct high - quality x - ray models and rigorously evaluate their reliability , taking into account the specific observing strategy employed by our instrument .",
    "the spatial resolution and large field of view of the rosat pspc make it ideal for our purposes . while the pspc does not have the energy or spatial resolution of chandra or xmm",
    ", it has a larger field of view than any instrument on either of these observatories and so imaging analyses of extended objects based on rosat data will continue to be relevant for the foreseeable future",
    ".    the density models which result from our analysis will also be useful for near - future experiments capable of measuring the sz distortion resulting from the bulk motion of the cluster gas .",
    "to this end we present predictions for the beam - averaged optical depth for the near - future acbar experiment , a sensitive bolometric receiver which will begin taking observations in antarctica early in 2001 .",
    "this instrument has four frequency channels between 150 ghz and 345 ghz , with matched @xmath23 beams , and will be sensitive to both the thermal and kinematic sz effects .    in the following section ,",
    "we first present a brief summary of icm models (   [ sec : icmmodels ] ) , along with the formalism associated with these models to describe bremmstrahlung emission and the sze . ",

    "the consequences of this x - ray analysis in the context of our measurement of @xmath6 will also be discussed in paper ii .",
    "one model for the cluster gas which has enjoyed great phenomenological success is the _ isothermal beta model _ @xcite . in this case",

    "the properties of this model are well - known and extensively tabulated in the literature .",
    "we have assumed that the icm is spherically symmetric . while this is not generally the case for individual clusters , it should be a good description on average for an orientation - unbiased sample (   [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "one generalization of the isothermal beta model which has some support both observationally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the hybrid isothermal / adiabatic model . in paper",

    "the bolometric luminosity due to bremsstrahlung emission from an ionized thermal plasma of electrons and protons is @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 is the electron number density , @xmath33 is the proton number density , @xmath34 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath35 is the local temperature of the plasma , and @xmath36 is the thermally averaged gaunt factor . for a plasma with the cosmic helium mass fraction @xmath37 and metal abundances of 30% solar , @xmath38 ; this is the value we adopt .",

    "the integral on the right hand side is the emission measure ( em ) : @xmath46 for the beta model , the em over all space reduces to @xmath47 if we know the form of the electron density profile @xmath48 , the cluster temperature @xmath35 , the redshift , and the bolometric flux , we may determine the normalization of the density profile : @xmath49 here we have used the fact that @xmath50 .    in practice the x - ray spectrum is observed over a finite bandpass with a finite aperture , and is modified by photoelectric absorption due to the intervening intra - galactic medium .",
    "we account for this by modeling the spectrum with xspec , nasa gsfc s standard x - ray spectral analysis program .",

    "[ eq : luminosity_distance ] used in deriving this equation assumed @xmath59 ; for @xmath60 this causes at most a @xmath61 error in @xmath27 for @xmath62 .",
    "this is the expression we use to determine the normalization of the cluster density profiles .",
    "@xcite show that the fractional change in intensity due to the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by a thermal plasma with a velocity @xmath63 along the line of sight is @xmath64 where @xmath35 is the temperature of the plasma , @xmath65 is the optical depth for inverse compton scattering @xmath66 @xmath67 is the dimensionless frequency @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 is a relativistic correction @xcite , which generally has a magnitude of a few percent that of the leading term for @xmath71 . in eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] , @xmath72 is the thompson scattering cross section ( @xmath73 ) and the integral is along the line of sight .",
    "since the rosat pspc data are not sensitive to temperature gradients , they are capable of directly constraining the cluster density profiles . for this reason we express our sze analysis in terms of the inverse compton optical depth .",
    "note that this also renders the results we present here independent of the relativistic correction @xmath70 , although this will have to be taken into account when relating the @xmath65 values we present to observed intensity decrements .",
    "a radio telescope will measure the intensity decrement convolved with the instrument beam pattern .",
    "it is then convenient to consider the quantity @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the telescope beam normalized to unity at the maximum .",
    "@xmath76 is typically well described by a gaussian : @xmath77 for the ovro 5.5-meter telescope we have @xmath78 @xcite , and for acbar , @xmath79 .",
    "the 5.5-meter telescope also switches by @xmath16 in azimuth to remove atmosphere and ground emission .",
    "we then define @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the switching vector which , at a given hour angle , corresponding to a @xmath16 offset in azimuth .",
    "since our analysis assumes spherical symmetry for the clusters , we will always compute this quantity at transit . the equivalent quantity to @xmath82",
    "then is @xmath83    in terms of these objects , the equivalent temperature decrement which a single - dish telescope will see for an isothermal cluster is @xmath84 for more details on this formalism , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "due to the assumption of spherical symmetry necessary to employ the sunyaev - zeldovich effect as a distance measure , it is vital to measure the sze in an unbiased sample . an x - ray selected , x",
    "- ray flux limited sample satisfies this criterion .",
    "the first steps in this direction were taken by @xcite who used the sample of @xcite to define an x - ray flux limited sample of 11 clusters with @xmath0 , @xmath85 ( 2 - 10 kev ) , galactic latitudes @xmath86 , and declinations @xmath87 .",
    "we improve upon this by defining a larger sample .",
    "this has two advantages .",
    "first , it will allow the ( random ) noise caused by departures from spherical symmetry to be reduced in the sample average .",
    "second , it will allow many possible systematic affects to be identified by dividing the sample into several sub - samples by , _",
    "e.g. _ , morphology , optical richness , or x - ray spectral characteristics .    as our parent sample",
    "we choose the xbac catalog of @xcite .",
    "ebeling et al .",
    "have analyzed the data of the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) to obtain a sample of 242 abell clusters complete at the @xmath88 level down to a flux limit of @xmath89 in the 0.12.4 kev band . if we conservatively adopt a flux cutoff of twice this ( @xmath90 ) and impose the luminosity cutoff ( @xmath91 for @xmath92 ) corresponding to a volume complete sample out to @xmath93 , we find 31 clusters in the xbac catalog that meet these criteria .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tbl : clustersample ] .",
    "since the xbac catalog ultimately uses the list of abell clusters as a parent sample , we must employ some caution in assessing the completeness of our sample . by comparing the overlap regions of the abell @xcite and aco @xcite catalogs ,",
    "@xcite find that abell missed 29% of the richness class 1 or greater clusters which were in aco ; most of these are @xmath94 objects .",
    "these results are consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that @xmath95 of @xmath96 objects are missed in monte carlo simulations with an optical selection algorithm designed to mimic that of abell and aco . in most cases ,",
    "these clusters are missed due to fluctuations in the background galaxy counts , resulting in the misclassification of actual clusters as poorer objects which are then not included in the catalog ; since this misclassification preferentially affects the poorer clusters , most of the missed clusters are again likely to be richness class 1 objects .",
    "our stringent luminosity criterion strongly selects against these poorer objects : only @xmath97 of our 31 cluster sample are @xmath98 , whereas @xmath99 of the 242 clusters in the xbac catalog have @xmath98 .",
    "van haarlem et al .",
    "find that a luminosity cutoff comparable to the one we have imposed , applied after the optical selection , results in a catalog which is free from false detections ( although this does not directly address the issue of orientation bias ) .",
    "based on these considerations , we estimate our sample to be 90% complete for @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "this corresponds to 3 missed clusters at most .",
    "this level of incompleteness will not significantly affect @xmath6 measurements derived from the sample as a whole .",

    "we have defined an x - ray flux - limited sample of 31 nearby galaxy clusters and analyzed rosat pspc data on 22 of these .",
    "the primary focus of our analysis is the quantification of sze modeling uncertainties . using a suite of monte carlo simulations",
    ", we find that on average we predict the inverse compton optical depth with an accuracy of @xmath108 for the ovro 5.5-meter telescope .",
    "these predictions are robust with respect to our cooling - flow modeling strategy and unaffected by realistic pspc systematics .",
    "we have also presented similarly accurate predictions of the inverse compton optical depth for the near - future acbar experiment . while somewhat less robust than the 5.5-meter predictions due to the small angular scales this telescope samples , these predictions should be more than sufficient for real - world applications .",
    "we have also confirmed the @xcite report of an excess column density of @xmath109 towards a478 , but do not find evidence for similar anomalies in any of 21 other clusters .",
    "there appears to be an excess of soft counts in the rosat pspc spectra , similar that reported by @xcite .    the mean baryon fraction within @xmath110 is found to be @xmath111 ; within @xmath112 , it is @xmath113 . for @xmath114 , these are @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the @xmath117 baryon fractions observed ( inside @xmath118 with @xmath107 ) by @xcite in analyses of einstein ipc data on galaxy clusters .",
    "our results are also in good agreement with those of @xcite , who find baryon fractions of @xmath119 within @xmath112 for an analysis of the 44 clusters in the edge sample with rosat pspc data .",
    "our mass fractions tend to be slightly lower on average . in part",
    "this is due to the fact that the x - ray temperatures used by others in the literature are often biased low by cooling flow emission ; the remainder is due to the difference in cluster modeling strategies . for @xmath120 our findings also agree with gas mass fractions determined by @xcite on the basis of interferometric observations of the sze in distant clusters . in a sample of 14 clusters ,",
    "they find a gas mass fraction of @xmath121 within @xmath112 ( at 68% confidence ) .    while a number of other systematic x - ray cluster analyses exist in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ours is the first to attempt to realistically quantify the effect of the uncertainties in the x - ray modeling on the predicted sze decrement for a given instrument . since the analysis of mohr et al .",
    "is closest to ours in spirit and technique , we have conducted a detailed comparison of their results to ours .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the mohr et al .",
    "determination of the baryonic mass internal to @xmath122 versus our determination of this quanitity .",
    "the overall agreement is excellent : the mean mass ratio ( @xmath123 ) is @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , strongly arguing against any systematic differences in our analyses .",
    "one of the most significant outliers is a478 , for which mohr et al .",
    "have used the anomalously low galactic value for @xmath126 ; the effect of correcting for this is shown by an arrow in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the scatter between our results , however , is somewhat larger than the @xmath127 scatter which is expected",
    ". this may be in part due to different strategies for profile modeling , spectral extraction , and dealing with cooling flows .",
    "we have attempted to directly assess the robustness of our results , but there are several considerations beyond the scope of this analysis which could affect our conclusions .",
    "the most significant is the possibility of substructure in the icm . @xcite",
    "have studied this in simulations of rosat pspc cluster observations and find a mean overestimate of the cluster density of @xmath128 . since these simulations do not include astrophysically important mechanisms such as cooling and conduction , it will be important to address this issue with the current and upcoming x - ray missions chandra and xmm , as well as more powerful simulations .",
    "also of some concern is the possibility of large - scale temperature gradients in the cluster . while this will not significantly affect the baryonic mass models we present here , it will affect thermal sze predictions and the inferred total masses .    for consistency with myers et al . and many other authors we have assumed @xmath129",
    "there is increasing evidence , however , that this may be wrong ( for a summary of the evidence see * ? ? ?",
    "due to the @xmath130 dependence of the baryonic mass on the distance scale , these results will be most affected by any errors in the cosmology we assume ; the inverse compton optical depths and central densities will be least affected .",
    "we have recomputed the sample average of the baryonic mass , baryonic mass fraction , and inverse compton optical depth for two currently viable cosmologies : an open ( @xmath131 ) model and a closed @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) model . for the closed @xmath132 model , the sample average baryonic mass is increased by 8.8% , the baryonic mass fraction by 5.1% , and the inverse compton optical depth by 1.7% .",
    "for the open model , the baryonic mass is increased by 3.0% , the baryonic mass fraction by 1.8% , and the inverse compton optical depth by only 0.6% .",
    "clearly this translation must be done on a cluster - by - cluster basis for a comparison of our @xmath65 predictions with sz data .    in paper ii we will use the models presented in this work , together with improved asca temperatures , to obtain a measurement of @xmath6 from sze measurements conducted with the ovro 5.5-meter telescope .",
    "the wider implications for cosmology of this work will also be discussed therein .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions with maxim markevitch , joe mohr , steve snowden , and alexey vikhlinin ; we also thank alexey vikhlinin for the use of his software .",
    "we thank patricia udomprasert for help in some of the data reduction .",
    "bsm was supported for part of the duration of this work by the zacheus daniels fund at the university of pennsylvania ; stm was supported by an alfred r. sloan fellowship at the university of pennsylvania .",
    "in this appendix we present the profiles resulting from our analysis ( figures  [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , and [ fig8 ] ) . the details of this analysis are described in   [ sec : dataanalysis ] .",
