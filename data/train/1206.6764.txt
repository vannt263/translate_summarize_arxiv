    "magnetic moments , beside the masses , are fundamental parameters of hadrons and carry significant information about their internal structure .",
    "therefore they have been of theoretical interest for a long time up to now .",
    "various approaches and models can be used to calculate these quantities . however , as noted in @xcite , the mass spectrum and magnetic moments probe largely orthogonal physical effects .",
    "for example , if we have a model adjusted to provide sufficiently good description of hadron masses , it is not certain that the description of magnetic moments will be of the same quality . in qcd",
    "we expect that a more accurate solution gives better description of masses and magnetic moments simultaneously . however , the phenomenological models used in practice to calculate hadron properties ( various potential , chiral , bag models , etc ) are not qcd .",
    "the typical example is the mit bag model .",
    "magnetic moments predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite are about 30% too small , in a serious conflict with the experiment",
    ". nevertheless , if one takes the ratios of all the other moments to that of a proton , the bag model predictions are similar to the usual quark model predictions .",
    "thus , the lower absolute value of magnetic moments in the bag model seems to be the overall scale problem .",
    "magnetic moments of individual quarks in the bag are associated with overlaps of the small and large components of the dirac wave functions .",
    "this overlap is proportional to the bag radius @xmath0 .",
    "can we find a way to enlarge the bag radius and not to spoil the relatively good description of the mass spectra ?",
    "in this case one is naturally tempted to add an extra phenomenological term which may help to ensure larger bag radii and consequently better values of magnetic moments .",
    "for example , the alternative confinement scheme based on a surface tension rather than a volume pressure was proposed @xcite .",
    "can one produce proper values of the magnetic moments by adding the surface energy term @xmath1 to the volume energy @xmath2 and refitting the model parameters ?",
    "unfortunately , no . the model with the surface tension was examined in detail in ref .",
    "it appears that the model in which the volume energy term is replaced by the surface tension energy provides results very similar to the former one .",
    "thus , if one adds the two terms together , one can arbitrarily choose one of the free parameters ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , and the results obtained are almost insensitive to this choice .",
    "one possible solution to the problem was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the point is to add the term that differs between mesons and baryons .",
    "the simplest such term is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the numbers of quarks and antiquarks , and @xmath8 is a new free parameter which could be adjusted so as to produce the needed large bag radius and ensure the correct value of the magnetic moment of ( say ) the proton .",
    "this procedure improves the overall description of baryon magnetic moments , however , another attractive feature of the bag model   the unified treatment of mesons and baryons using the same expression for the particle mass   is being lost .",
    "a different and more elegant ( in our opinion ) way to deal with the problem is associated with the so called center - of - mass motion ( c.m.m . )",
    "the bag model is usually constructed as an independent particle shell model .",
    "therefore there is a sizeable spurious contribution to the energy from the motion of the center of mass , which is confined inside the bag . for the ground - state hadrons , the c.m.m",
    "energy is simply an inconvenience and requires some correction to the energy .",
    "while there are questions as to the best method for estimating these corrections , they must be taken into account in some fashion and , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , may be applied to restore the correct order of magnitude of the magnetic moments .",
    "the idea really works .",
    "the corrected values of the magnetic moments are much closer to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "still , some discrepancy remains indicating that the correction is somewhat too weak .",
    "can we proceed with the improvement of the magnetic moments ? in the present paper",
    "we will show that such improvement is possible via choosing a proper value of the zero - point ( casimir ) energy .",
    "the concept of casimir energy appears in the bag model phenomenology almost immediately after the birth of the model @xcite with the wrong sign of the energy term at first . in the early versions of the model the bag energy necessary to fit hadron masses had the term @xmath9 with negative @xmath10",
    "this term was plausibly erroneously interpreted as the casimir energy . when the c.m.m .",
    "corrections are taken into account , from the phenomenological point of view there is no need of such a term at all @xcite .",
    "moreover , the careful analysis shows @xcite that casimir force for a spherical shell with the bag model boundary conditions is repulsive , and , consequently , the constant @xmath10 must be of positive sign .",
    "now it is almost clear how casimir energy may improve the magnitude of magnetic moments .",
    "the strength of the c.m.m .",
    "correction is usually derived from the fit of certain hadron masses to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "so , if we add some positive term to the uncorrected energy , the correction would be stronger , enlarging the magnitude of the corrected magnetic moments in turn .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we describe briefly the model we are dealing with and present explicit expressions for magnetic moments of the baryon octet and decuplet . in sec .  3 we examine the dependence of the light hadron masses and magnetic moments on the magnitude of the casimir energy parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the `` best '' fit to the magnetic moments is found .",
    "the new model parameters are used to recalculate the ground - state hadron masses and magnetic moments of the light baryon octet and decuplet .",
    "the results obtained are compared with other theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the mit bag model was at first formulated as a lorentz - invariant field theory @xcite .",
    "however , for the investigation of hadron properties the static spherical cavity approximation of the model was widely used and even became the synonym of the mit bag model .",
    "the hadron bag energy in this approximation is given by @xmath11 the four terms on the right - hand side are :    * the bag volume energy , @xmath12 where @xmath3 is the so - called bag constant , and @xmath0 is the radius of the confinement region ( bag radius ) ; * the sum of single - particle quark energies @xmath13 where the energies of individual quarks obey the eigenvalue equation @xmath14 * quark  quark interaction energy due one - gluon exchange @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the color - magnetostatic and color - electrostatic ( coulomb ) pieces of the interaction energy ( for more details see @xcite ) ; * casimir energy term @xmath18    the parameter @xmath10 is thought to be calculable in qcd , and to some extent it is .    the interaction energy in eq .",

    "up and down quarks are assumed to be massless , and the ( scale - dependent ) mass of the strange quark is to be obtained from the mass function @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two free model parameters .",
    "the calculation of the hadron mass spectrum is performed in two steps .",
    "first , for each hadron the energy ( [ eq2.01a ] ) is to be minimized with respect to the bag radius @xmath0 . in this way",
    "the bag radii @xmath27 of individual hadrons are obtained",
    ". then one can use eq .",
    "( [ eq2.01a ] ) to calculate the hadron bag energy @xmath28",
    ". however , this is not the whole story .",
    "the bag energy still contains the spurious c.m.m .",
    "a prescription must be given to relate the eigenvalues of the static bag model hamiltonian to the masses of hadrons .",
    "to this end we adopt the procedure proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied in @xcite . in this approach",
    "the bag state is expressed as the wave packet of the physical states @xmath29 with various total momenta : @xmath30 with the gaussian parametrization of the profile function @xcite @xmath31    the effective momentum square @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the momenta of the individual quarks , and @xmath35 is an adjustable parameter governing the c.m.m .",

    "( [ eq2.04d ] ) is to be solved numerically .",
    "we also must decide how to deal with the zoo of free parameters .",
    "altogether , there are seven parameters   @xmath3 , @xmath39 , @xmath22 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we will use the same prescription as in @xcite for the first six of them : @xmath3 , @xmath39 , @xmath22 , and @xmath20 will be determined by fitting calculated masses of light hadrons ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the average mass of the @xmath43@xmath44 system ) to experimental data , @xmath25 and @xmath45 from the fit to the masses of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "the quantities used as input data are indicated by asterisk ( * ) .[t3.4 ] [ cols=\"^,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     when we pick the larger values of @xmath10 , the gain in the casimir energy induces changes of bag parameters through the fitting procedure .",
    "for example , when the casimir energy becomes larger , a smaller value of strong coupling constant is necessary to obtain the same masses of light hadrons chosen to fix the bag model parameters .",
    "therefore we expect that with the increase of @xmath10 the mass difference between vector and scalar mesons as well as between spin-3@xmath1212 and spin-1@xmath1212 baryons will become smaller .",
    "on the other hand , for the fit of the @xmath46 meson mass a larger strange quark mass will be necessary .",
    "then the masses of hadrons containing strange quarks will increase .",
    "for some hadrons these two effects may partially compensate each other .",
    "we can see precisely such behaviour of hadron masses in table  [ t3.2 ] : the masses of @xmath169 , @xmath173 , and @xmath107 increase , while the masses of @xmath170 , @xmath172 , and @xmath174 fall down .",
    "an exception is the @xmath171 hyperon , the mass of which is strongly correlated with the mass of @xmath47 and the latter is nailed down because it ( together with @xmath46 ) is used to obtain the model mass parameters .",
    "however , in the variant  _ 1 _ of the model the changes of hadron masses are extremely small , and the values of @xmath10 in a wide range ( @xmath180 ) could be treated as a good choice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3.1 ] ) .",
    "we can say that in this sense the variant  _ 1 _ is relatively stable . in the variant",
    "_ 2 _ the situation differs .",
    "an increase in @xmath10 improves the light hadron mass spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3.1 ] again ) . in this case",
    "the large values of @xmath10 ( @xmath181 ) would be preferable .",
    "though we se that the reintroduction of the casimir energy into the bag model hamiltonian with the value of @xmath182 can make the hadron mass predictions in the variant  _ 2 _ of the model to be of the similar quality as the predictions of variant  _",
    "1_.    now let us see what is the effect of the changes in @xmath10 on the calculated values of magnetic moments . from figs .",
    "[ fig3.3 ] , [ fig3.4 ] we see that there exists almost linear dependence of c.m.m . corrected magnetic moments on the casimir energy parameter @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath179 0.37 in variant  _ 2 _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3.3 ] ) would provide the required value 2.79@xmath183 of the magnetic moment of a proton ( @xmath183 stands for nuclear magneton , not to be confused with magnetic moment of neutron ) .",
    "the value 0.37 looks like magic because it is exactly the same value that was deduced from qed .",
    "no doubt , it is a simple coincidence .",
    "such things happen .",
    "our strategy is to find the optimal values of the casimir energy parameter from the minimization of @xmath184 .",
    "the values obtained in this way are @xmath185 0.22 and @xmath186 0.64 for the variants  _ 1 _ and  _ 2 _ , respectively . now comparing predictions for magnetic moments in both variants of the model we see that , after all , variant  _ 2 _ gives prominently better results .",
    "explicit results for magnetic moments in both cases are listed in table  [ t3.3 ] . and",
    "finally , in tables  [ t3.4 ] , [ t3.5 ] we compare our predictions for magnetic moments with other calculations performed using different approaches .",
    "these are : the simple nonrelativistic result obtained using values from the two - parameter fit ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 ) @xcite , the translationally invariant model with harmonic oscillator wave functions @xcite , the chiral constituent quark model @xcite , the chiral perturbation theory @xcite , the six - parameter fit based on the chiral bag sum rules @xcite , the eight - parameter fit based on large-__n__@xmath190 chiral perturbation theory @xcite , the eight - parameter fit based on @xmath191 expansion @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , and the lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "in the end , let us see what we could expect and what we got .",
    "the main field of interest of our present work was the magnetic moments of the light baryons .",
    "the calculations were based on the usual quark model formula ( eq .  ( [ eq2.05a ] ) ) , which expresses the magnetic moments of baryons through the magnetic moments of individual quarks @xmath192 . in the old - fashioned nonrelativistic approach @xmath192 usually appear as free parameters . if the isospin symmetry is assumed ( @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath195 ) ,",
    "one has a two - parameter fit .",
    "the typical deviation from the experiment @xmath184 in such an approach @xcite is ( 0.130.14)@xmath183 . in some models ( for example , such as bag model , relativistic potential model @xcite , or qcd string approach @xcite ) magnetic moments of quarks @xmath192 can be calculated directly without introduction of any new parameters .",
    "the agreement with experiment data in these cases is somewhat worse , with @xmath184 in the interval ( 0.150.18)@xmath183 .",
    "it is rather hard to improve this result .",
    "for example , in various chiral models @xcite @xmath184 lies in the range ( 0.140.15)@xmath183 .",
    "better fits require more free parameters .",
    "some authors @xcite managed to reduce @xmath184 to ( 0.040.05)@xmath183 with eight - parameter fits .",
    "it could be interesting to note that similar accuracy ( @xmath196 0.05@xmath183 ) was achieved by l.g .",
    "pondrom in  @xcite with only four free parameters in his hand - made expressions for magnetic moments of _ u- _ and _ s- _ quarks .    in our bag model calculations",
    "we have used only one free parameter ( casimir energy parameter @xmath10 ) and obtained a significant improvement , though not so impressive as the 8-parameter fit . the discrepancy with experimental data",
    "@xmath184 was reduced ( in the variant  _ 2 _ of the model ) from 0.21@xmath183 to 0.12@xmath183 .",
    "simultaneously , predictions for the light hadron mass spectrum were improved as well . moreover ,",
    "the value of the casimir energy parameter @xmath10 required for the `` best '' fit is close to its theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "so , should we include the casimir energy in the bag model hamiltonian or not ?",
    "from theoretical point of view the answer seems to be `` yes '' . from phenomenological point of view",
    "the answer would be more modest : `` it depends '' .",
    "if one is interested in the mass spectrum only , one can use the simpler variant  _ 1 _ of the bag model and plausibly do not care about anything else .",
    "however , if for some reason we have decided to exploit the theoretically more consistent variant  _ 2 _ , or we are interested in the calculation of magnetic moments , then incorporation of the casimir energy in the bag model hamiltonian would be a reasonable choice ."
