    "scanning near - field optical microcopy ( snom ) has become an established and accepted method for this purpose @xcite . however , the presence of a physical probe , which disturbs the optical functionality of the structure and limits the spatial resolution , as well as the scanning nature of the method prompted the development of alternative experimental techniques @xcite .",

    "the measurements are accompanied by rigorous numerical simulations as well as analytical modeling of the interference of hankel plasmons and the illumination under ultrafast excitation conditions , which explain the experimental findings with very good agreement .",

    "a plasmonic nanoantenna generally consists of a small metallic nanostructure that can sustain a plasmonic mode which is able to oscillate in resonance .",
    "the resonance frequencies and other properties such as the field profile or emissivity of the nanoantenna are determined by the size , shape and material of the structure and can be tuned to fit a particular intended functionality @xcite .",

    "one can tune the periodicity such that the condition for resonant coupling of outward- into inward - propagating hspps is met .",

    "the grating increases the resonance strength in the central disc by enhancing the partial reflection of outward - propagating hspps at its circumference .",
    "this increase in modal reflectivity enhances the quality factor of the resonator and leads to a better performance of the nanoantenna .    a second possibility to employ the grating considers the excitation of the antenna by incident light .",
    "the bare disc can be excited from free - space illumination in the quasi - static regime thanks to its subwavelength size @xcite .",
    "such an approach does not require phase matching to the hankel modes and can be used to excite the disc at any wavelength within the bandwidth of its localized plasmonic resonance .",

    "the occurrence of a bragg resonance facilitates the interaction of the inward- and outward - propagating hankel mode which manifests itself by the formation of a bandgap .",
    "the hspps become evanescent in the grating region and a coupling between the two otherwise orthogonal modes is possible within the penetration depth of the modes into the grating .",
    "while the usually used first order bragg resonance is located at the band edges , the second order bragg resonance appears at the @xmath34-point , _ i.e._for a vanishing in - plane quasi - wavevector .",
    "this facilitates the interaction of both the in- and outward hspp mode with near - normal incident light .",
    "the coupling to inward propagating hspps will further enhance the resonance of the nanoantenna whereas the excited outward propagating hspp will be visible on the gold film surrounding the structure .",
    "we investigated the nanoantenna structure by means of multiphoton photoemission electron microscopy ( peem ) .",
    "samples for the ring - enhanced nanoantenna structure and also the bare nanodisc antenna were fabricated by evaporating a gold film on a fused silica substrate .",

    "the scanning electron beam provides the energy to permanently adsorb chemicals ( most likely carbon ) which are present .",
    "since peem is extremely sensitive to surface conditions , even a monolayer of adsorbed material can alter the effective work function .",
    "in our case , it is slightly increased in the scanned area which explains the darker region in the center .",
    "the outer region represents parts which were not scanned by the electron beam .",
    "although the effect seems disturbing it actually increases the signal - to - noise ratio of our measurements and provides the possibility to accurately overlay peem images with the sem image .",

    "photoemission is known to be very sensitive to the presence of an electric field component perpendicular to the surface @xcite . in the case of tm illumination",
    ", we thus find a strong excitation of the central disc .",
    "both polarizations were ensured to carry the same power and were measured using the same exposure time .",
    "apart from the strong resonance in the center , we also find a weaker lobe - like enhancement in the horizontal direction , which was the plane of incidence .",
    "this is consistent with hankel plasmon theory , which predicts that the excitation intensity drops as @xmath36 for tm modes , where @xmath2 is the angle to the horizontal direction .",
    "consequently , no excitation of hspps is observed in the vertical direction .",
    "it should also be noticed that the photoelectron yield is slightly increased at the positions of the rings .",
    "although there can not be electron emission from the gaps , sharp edges lead to a higher probability for electron emission due to confinement effects .",
    "this manifests itself in the increased yield at the ring positions since the gaps are too narrow to be accurately resolved .",
    "we were able to measure a weaker but noticeable yield also for te polarization .",
    "the reason for this is , that the excited hspps themselves provide for the necessary perpendicular electric field component .",
    "this argumentation is supported by the fact that we measured a much lower yield for the bare nanodisc sample in te polarization as well , where the excitation of hspps will be shown to be only very weak in section  [ bare_disc ] . in the ring - enhanced case ,",
    "a clear excitation along the vertical image direction is visible . for this polarization ,",
    "theory predicts a @xmath37 dependence of the intensity , which is in agreement with our experiments .",
    "however , we find that the picture has clear qualitative differences to the tm case .",
    "the central disc was not excited .",
    "instead , a larger dipolar hankel mode in vertical direction forms on the area between the disc and the first ring .",
    "we again observe a lobe - like spatial structure in polarization direction and an increased yield from the ring positions , similar to the tm case .",
    "we compared the experimental peem images to rigorous simulations using the finite - difference time - domain method ( fdtd ) .",
    "full 3d simulations were employed under incidence using the freely available fdtd software meep @xcite .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_peem_comparison ] .",
    "the left panel shows the intensity calculated close to the sample surface for both polarizations .",
    "it becomes evident that the qualitative difference we observed between the two polarization directions is inherent to the investigated structure .",
    "the tm simulation confirms that the central disc is the location of the highest intensity in this case whereas it is not excited in the te case .",
    "the symmetry of the system is broken by the incidence angle while the additional rings increase the angular sensitivity of the antenna .",
    "although the fdtd intensity results confirm in principle our peem measurement data , the images look quantitatively different .",
    "the background level within the ring area is much higher in the measurement and no pronounced two - lobe structure is seen for the te case . to explain this discrepancy",
    ", one must not forget that the photoelectron yield is not a direct measure for the electromagnetic fields .",
    "an accurate modeling is needed to connect the two quantities .",
    "we therefore employ a model which connects the photoelectron yield to the temporal integral of the sixth power of the instantaneous electric field .",
    "this is facilitated by the fact that the probability for three - photon photoemission should be proportional to the absolute value squared of the matrix element for three photon absorption , following a nonlinear generalization of fermi s golden rule @xcite .",
    "this matrix element involves the interaction hamiltonian @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an atomic dipolar moment and thus leaves us with the overall dependence on the electric field to the sixth power in the 3-photon case .",

    "either contains only a parallel component ( te case ) , or both components in phase ( tm case ) which are superimposed during the duration of the pulse .",
    "since we use just a single ultrashort pulse to perform the experiment , hspps are excited from the early parts of the pulse and interfere with later parts in a spatio - temporal coherent manner .",
    "this creates the interference patterns typical for multiphoton peem experiments .    to take this into account , we modeled the peem yield by coherently superimposing the nanoantenna near - field extracted from the fdtd data with the corresponding illuminating field components , allowing the amplitude and total phase of the latter as a free fit parameter .",
    "the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_peem_comparison ] shows the result of the modeling .",
    "the same fit parameters were used for both polarizations . a remarkable agreement with the measurement data",
    "is achieved .",
    "the te case shows the correct two - lobe structure now .",
    "additionally , background levels and even finer details are accurately reproduced qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "a peculiar difference is that the model overestimates the yield from the positions of the rings .",
    "the reason for this is the plasmonic field enhancement within small gaps , which is present in the fdtd data .",
    "since the gaps are not filled with metal , no enhancement of the photoelectron yield can occur at these positions apart from the sharp edges as discussed earlier .",
    "in addition to the antenna resonance , we observe outward - propagating hspps on the surrounding gold film in both polarization cases .",
    "they can be analyzed in detail since a full analytical theory is readily available @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that the measured hspps obeyed the predicted angular dependence of the intensity as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ( not shown ) .    to further investigate their properties , we extracted a cut through the horizontal ( tm ) or vertical direction ( te ) , shown as dashed areas in fig .",

    "<S> we report on the investigation of an advanced circular plasmonic nanoantenna under ultrafast excitation using nonlinear photoemission electron microscopy ( peem ) under near - normal incidence . </S>",
    "<S> the circular nanoantenna is enhanced in its performance by a supporting grating and milled out from a gold film . </S>",
    "<S> the considered antenna shows a sophisticated physical resonance behavior that is ideal to demonstrate the possibilities of peem for the experimental investigations of plasmonic effects on the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> field profiles of the antenna resonance for both possible linear polarizations of the incident field are measured with high spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , outward propagating hankel plasmons , which are also excited by the structure , are measured and analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our findings to measurements of an isolated plasmonic nanodisc resonator and scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom ) measurements of both structures . </S>",
    "<S> all results are in very good agreement with numerical simulations as well as analytial models that are also discussed in our paper . </S>"
