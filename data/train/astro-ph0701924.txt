    "deep galaxy surveys have found consistently that the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) depends strongly on both @xmath0 and redshift @xmath1 , with the bulk of star formation ( sf ) occurring earlier in massive galaxies than in less massive systems ( e.g. guzmn et al .",

    "values of @xmath0 and sfr are based on a kroupa ( 2001 ) imf , following recent results by hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) .",

    "we draw conclusions only where the sample is @xmath23 complete ( @xmath24dex @xmath25 for @xmath4 , see vertical lines in fig .",
    "1 ) . for galaxies with robust @xmath6 m detections ( @xmath26jy ) , sfrs were derived following le floch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) sed templates ; using templates from dale & helou ( 2002 ) yields no significant differences .",
    "we then add to the @xmath6m - based sfr the sfr estimated from deep2 emission lines ( h@xmath27 , h@xmath28 , or [ oii]3727 , depending on @xmath1 ) with no extinction correction , to account for sf from unobscured regions .",
    "this approach is similar to that employed by bell et al .",
    "2005 ; utilizing rest - frame uv continuum sfrs ( as they did ) in place of emission - line fluxes yields consistent results .",
    "galaxies below the @xmath6 m detection limit are not dominated by highly extincted sf ; for these , we use extinction - corrected sfr from emission lines ; these can probe to roughly @xmath29 lower sfr than the @xmath6 m data , and are slightly more sensitive at high @xmath1 and cover a larger area than galex data .",
    "emission line luminosities ( as calculated in weiner et al .",
    "2006 ) were transformed to an h@xmath27 luminosity using average line ratios measured from deep2 data ( h@xmath28/h@xmath30 , [ oii]/h@xmath31 ; weiner 2006 , private communication ) , and transformed to sfr using the h@xmath27 calibration of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the deep2 h@xmath28/h@xmath27 ratio corresponds to an extinction of 1.30mag at h@xmath27 assuming case b recombination , which was applied to correct the emission line sfrs .",
    "we use fixed rather than @xmath32-dependent line ratios ( a la weiner et al . ) , because these predict extinction corrected sfr slightly in excess of the @xmath6 m derived sfr for high mass galaxies .",
    "our simple but robust approach yields results in good agreement with sfr derived from galex data , extinction - corrected based on uv spectral slopes .    for objects with both @xmath33jy and emission - line @xmath34",
    ", we estimate a 2-@xmath35 upper limit on sfr from the most sensitive emission line available , by adding @xmath36 to the measured uncertain sfr , or , for non - detections , to the limit of @xmath37-detectable emission line sfr at the galaxy s redshift .",
    "we again apply @xmath38 for extinction corrections , certainly an overestimate since extinction is lower in more weakly sf galaxies ( hopkins et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we have performed a suite of tests of these sf estimates , finding that adopting different sfr tracers changes results moderately ( noeske et al 2007 , in prep . ) ; qualitative results are unaffected .",
    "random errors in our @xmath6m - based sfrs are @xmath39dex from photometry and @xmath40 dex from scatter in the f(@xmath6 m ) to l(ir ) conversion ( see marcillac et al .",
    "2006 ) , yet total random errors are expected to be 0.3 - 0.4dex ( see bell et al .",
    "2005 ) . for extinction - corrected emission line sfrs ,",
    "random errors are @xmath41dex , including scatter about the assumed mean extinction .",
    "[ ms ]    fig .",
    "1 shows sfr as a function of @xmath0 in four independent redshift bins .",
    "the following discussion refers only to the stellar mass range where the sample is @xmath23 complete , marked by the vertical dotted lines in each redshift bin .",
    "we identify three different categories of galaxies :    \\(1 ) the majority of galaxies show clear signs of sf , either robust @xmath6 m detections , or , at lower @xmath0 , blue colors and emission lines ( blue symbols in fig .",
    "1 ) . quantitative hst morphologies ( gini / m20 , lotz et al .",
    "2006 ; cas , conselice 2003 ) classify @xmath42 of these galaxies as early types ( e , s0,sa ) , and @xmath43 show visual signs of sf such as blue regions and dust lanes .",
    "most of them lie on the `` blue cloud '' , ( e.g. willmer et al .",
    "2006 ) , though some of the massive ones are red , likely dusty , star - forming galaxies ( bell et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this category ( blue symbols in fig .",
    "1 ) comprises 67(56)% of the sample at @xmath44 in the @xmath0 range where the sample is complete .",
    "( 2 ) clearly separated are galaxies without robust @xmath6 m ( @xmath45jy ) or emission line ( @xmath37 ) detections ( orange arrows in fig .",
    "1 ) . the upper limits on their sfr are conservatively high (  2 ) , such that the true separation between the sequence and the other galaxies is likely larger than it appears here .",
    "almost all ( @xmath23 ) of these galaxies are on the red sequence , and @xmath46 at @xmath44 have early - type quantitative morphologies including early - type mergers , while @xmath43 at @xmath47 have early - type visual morphologies with no hints of current sf .",
    "these galaxies contribute @xmath48 of the sample at @xmath44 .",
    "\\(3 ) scattered below the star - forming sequence are galaxies with robust emission line detections but no significant @xmath6 m emission , @xmath49 of the sample at @xmath44 .",
    "all of these galaxies ( green crosses in fig . 1 ) are on the red sequence and their @xmath50 emission line equivalent widths tend to be low ( few  ) .",
    "yan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and weiner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the bulk of the line emission in red galaxies out to intermediate redshifts is due to liner / agn emission , not sf .",
    "we find that @xmath51 of those galaxies with [ oii ] and h@xmath28 detections show liner - like line ratios , and @xmath52 at @xmath44 have early - type quantitative and visual morphologies that are typical for local liners ( yan et al .",
    "line emission in these red galaxies thus appears to be dominated by liners / agn , particularly at @xmath47 where they are more frequent .",
    "their sfr , derived from emission lines ( fig .",
    "1 ) , will mostly be overestimated . however , we find visual signs of sf in the hst images in @xmath53 of these galaxies , comparable to the fraction of non - early quantitative morphologies ; these may be dominated by sf .",
    "the star forming galaxies form a distinct sequence of sfr with @xmath0 , which we term the `` main sequence '' ( ms ) . the red lines in fig .",
    "1 enclose 34% of galaxies both above and below the median ( red points ) , and thus indicate the equivalent of @xmath54 for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the width of the ms measured in this way ( the range in sfr about the median at a given @xmath0 ) is about @xmath55 dex , and seems to remain approximately constant in our sample over the redshift range @xmath56 .",
    "subtracting a lower limit of non - systematic scatter in sfr ( @xmath57dex ,  2 ) in quadrature yields an upper limit of @xmath58dex on the _ intrinsic _ scatter , which is still broadened by the width of the @xmath1 bins , and by additional spread from combining different sfr tracers .",
    "errors in @xmath0 hardly affect @xmath59 .",
    "the slope of the ms is shallower than unity , @xmath60 for @xmath0 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "there is a trend for the slope to flatten to higher @xmath1 , but the completeness limits do not allow a robust quantification .",
    "a further important result is that the normalization of the main sequence evolves strongly over the redshift range of our sample ; the median sfr at fixed @xmath0 evolves downwards by a factor of 3 , measured at @xmath62 , from the our highest ( median @xmath64 ) to our lowest ( median @xmath65 ) redshift bin .",
    "importantly , it appears that the _ whole of the main sequence _ shifts downwards with time , rather than just the upper envelope decreasing , which was also reported by a recent galex study at @xmath66 ( zamojski et al .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of these observations is that normal star - forming galaxies possess a limited range of sfr at a given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is presumably set by whatever physical processes regulate sf in quiescent disks .",
    "galaxies that are not on the main sequence , in categories ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above , are observed during or after quenching of the sf activity , with either low - level or no current sf , or liner / agn activity .",
    "it is obviously crucial to determine whether the `` main sequence '' that we have identified is real , or could be caused by selection effects or observational biases .",
    "we address the following possible causes of incompleteness or bias in our sample , again restricting the discussion to the @xmath0 range where we claim that the sample is @xmath23 complete :    * ( 1 ) * could the optically selected deep2 parent sample be missing a significant number of galaxies , or are there galaxies in the deep2 sample that lack a successful redshift determination because of low s / n ? * ( 2 ) * could we be significantly underestimating the sfr in galaxies in our sample due to biases in our sf indicators ?    * ( 1 ) * the deep2 spectroscopic selection ( @xmath67 ) has been shown to be complete in the @xmath0 ranges indicated in fig .",
    "1 ( vertical lines ) , from comparisons to various surveys with spectroscopic and deep photometric redshifts , including in particular the @xmath17-selected @xmath68 survey , which should be less affected by extinction ( willmer et al .",
    "2006 , bundy et al .",
    "2006 , cimatti et al .",
    "2006 ) . for galaxies that are below our @xmath6 m detection limit , we expect the extinction to be moderate , and would expect these galaxies to be picked up in @xmath17-selected surveys , but no such population is found to be missed by deep2 .",
    "more obscured populations can be probed through the deep spitzer irac @xmath69 m data in aegis , which at a given redshift are a proxy for @xmath0 yet are barely affected by extinction .",
    "we have compared the distribution of @xmath70(@xmath6 m ) at a given @xmath70(@xmath69 m ) and @xmath1 in the deep2 @xmath71-selected sample and an irac @xmath70(@xmath69m)-selected sample with irac - based photometric redshifts .",
    "we find no evidence that deep2 misses a significant population of heavily obscured , star - forming galaxies at @xmath72 , which could populate the area above the upper boundary of the ms .",
    "this agrees with the results of houck et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and weedman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the large area ndwfs , which indicate that such missed @xmath70(@xmath6m)-bright , optically faint galaxies at @xmath73 would contribute @xmath74 of our sample .    *",
    "( 2 ) * the @xmath6 m completeness limit ( horizontal black dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) intersects the main sequence in each redshift bin . as discussed in  [ ms ] , most galaxies below the ms are red , early type , non - sf , and/or liner / agn dominated ( shown as orange arrows and green crosses ) .",
    "however , a fraction show spiral / late - type morphologies or visual signs of possible sf (  3 ) . in principle , these red galaxies could have dust - obscured sf , unrecovered by emission lines , yet lie below the @xmath6 m detection limit .",
    "their true sfrs could then be anywhere up to the @xmath6 m limit , in which case they may not be a distinct population , but rather a downward continuation of the ms .",
    "if this were the case , these galaxies would make up @xmath75 of the ms at @xmath44 .",
    "we can constrain the maximal effect of missed , dust - obscured sf in these galaxies on the 1@xmath35 range of sfr along the ms by including in the calculation of @xmath59 all red , @xmath6m - undetected galaxies with spiral / late - type morphologies , and h@xmath27,h@xmath28 , and/or [ oii ] line emission down to spurious detections ( i.e. , 100% error in ew ) . for the extremes of either only the emission line sfr or the maximal sfr , corresponding to the @xmath6 m limit , the measured width of the ms increases by @xmath76dex or not at all , respectively .",
    "thus we argue that the relatively sharp upper limit of the ms is real , as our selection does not miss obscured sources with high sfr .",
    "the sharpness of the lower limit is more uncertain with our current data , but we find that only a small fraction of galaxies that we placed below the ms could have underestimated sf rates which would `` blur out '' the lower edge of the ms .",
    "very deep 24@xmath77 data at @xmath12 from goods ( elbaz 2006 , private communication ) unambiguously confirm this result , particularly a well - defined lower boundary to the sequence .",
    "studies based on local samples ( brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 , salim et al .",
    "2005 for sdss ; lee 2006 ) have illustrated a relationship between sfr and @xmath0 , and have identified two populations : galaxies on a star - forming sequence , and `` quenched '' galaxies with little or no detectable sf . at higher @xmath1 , previous studies ( see  1 ) had merely described an upper envelope of sfr in the sfr- @xmath0 diagrams .",
    "we have employed a variety of sfr tracers and other evidence from aegis to show that the sf sequence persists out to @xmath12 , with a similar dispersion in log(sfr ) at fixed @xmath0 but with a decrease in normalization of a factor of 3 from @xmath64 to @xmath78 , measured at @xmath79 .",
    "the _ global _ star formation rate density has also decreased by a factor of 3 over this same interval ( hopkins et al .",
    "2004 , eq .",
    "3 ) . one possible physical explanation for this decline is a decreasing contribution from starbursts in gas - rich galaxy mergers . however ,",
    "if this were the dominant factor causing the decline , we would expect to see the upper envelope of the main sequence move downwards with time , with the region populated by `` normal '' galaxies maintaining the same normalization .",
    "this is contrary to what we see in aegis : the region of the sfr-@xmath0 space populated by main sequence galaxies at @xmath80 ( brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ) is nearly empty at @xmath811 , though these galaxies should be detectable in our survey .",
    "we can use our observed ms to quantitatively constrain the duty cycle of episodic variations of sfr around an average level .",
    "we adopt the densely populated peak of the sfr distribution ( the median ) as this baseline level .",
    "the @xmath82 ranges about the median of log(sfr ) , @xmath83dex , include 68(95)% of the galaxies .",
    "we can hence infer that sfr variations exceeding @xmath84dex , factors of 2(4 ) , have duty cycles @xmath85 .",
    "these correspond to total times of @xmath86gyr since @xmath10 .",
    "the amplitude of these variations ( @xmath87 ) is consistent with gas - poor or minor mergers , rather than the peak sfr of gas - rich major mergers ( springel 2000 , cox et al .",
    "excursions in sfr @xmath88 above the median are rare , @xmath89 , consistent with galaxies spending @xmath90 myr in such strong burst episodes since @xmath10 .",
    "of course these arguments are only valid in a statistical sense : a fraction of galaxies could have a lower average level of sf and undergo larger excursions , but at the expense of reducing the allowed range of sfr for the remainder of the population .",
    "previous studies have found that @xmath91% of sf at @xmath92 occurs in morphologically disturbed galaxies ( wolf et al .",
    "2005 ; bell et al . 2005 ) or close pairs ( lin et al .",
    "semi - analytic models predict that about 5% of the sf at @xmath81 is due to major mergers , with the contribution due to minor mergers being more uncertain , but ranging from @xmath9345 % ( somerville et al .",
    "2001 ; wolf et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these direct constraints and theoretical expectations are consistent with the conclusions that we have drawn here from the sfr-@xmath0 distributions .",
    "a related comment pertains to the nature of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath94 ) .",
    "lirgs at @xmath95 are rare , mostly interacting galaxies ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) with strong starbursts ( sfr @xmath96 above those of typical spirals ) . at @xmath12 ,",
    "lirgs seem to mostly represent the high level of sfr in almost all massive sf galaxies , rather then extreme starbursts ( fig .",
    "1 )  . in summary",
    ", we suggest a picture in which we are witnessing a gradual decline in the sfr of most galaxies since @xmath97 , accompanied by rapid quenching in a fraction of ( massive ) galaxies .",
    "presumably the regularity and constant dispersion of the main sequence out to @xmath98 means that the same physics that regulates sf in local disk galaxies is operating , indicating significant evolution either in the gas supply or sf efficiencies over this interval .    in the accompanying letter ( noeske et al .",
    "2007 , this volume ) , we show that the slope and evolution of the ms can be understood as gradual gas exhaustion in a model in which galaxy age and sf timescale are a function of galaxy mass , and the dispersion of the ms is interpreted as resulting from a spread in age and sf timescales at a given mass .",
