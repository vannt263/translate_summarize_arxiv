    "in recent years we have learnt a great deal about possible quantum phase transitions out of neel ordered phases of spin-@xmath2 quantum antiferromagnets in two spatial dimensions@xcite .",
    "much of the work have focussed on circumstances where the neel ordering is collinear ( _ i.e. _ , where all the spins align along a common axis , but , alternate in direction ) .",
    "it is now known that such collinear neel states can give way to paramagnetic valence bond solids ( vbs ) , which break lattice translation symmetry but not spin rotation symmetry , through generic second order quantum phase transitions . since the two phases ( neel and vbs ) break incompatible symmetries of the hamiltonian , a continuous transition between them , within the conventional paradigm of critical phenomena ( known as the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm @xcite ) , is not allowed except at _ fine - tuned _ multi - critical points .",
    "hence the above generic second order transition has been dubbed as _ landau - forbidden _ @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ deconfined criticality _ has been introduced in the context of this and other similar phase transitions @xcite .",
    "possible continuous phase transitions between the collinear neel phases and gapless spin liquids that do not break any symmetries have also been described @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quantum phase transitions out of the spiral ordered neel phase ( _ i.e. _ , with non - collinear spin patterns ) , that may occur on non - bipartite lattices , have not been as extensively studied . early theoretical",
    "works@xcite discussed continuous phase transitions from such a spiral state to a gapped @xmath1 spin liquid with fractionalized spin-@xmath2 spinon ( bosonic ) excitations and associated non - magnetic @xmath1 vortices ( dubbed visons @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have given rise to speculations that disordering spiral magnets naturally lead to deconfined spin liquids and the transition between the spiral phases and conventional paramagnets with valence bond order has remained unexplored .",
    "this is despite good theoretical motivations and some numerical evidence that exists for understanding such transitions as is reviewed below .",
    "quite generally one can view the nature of the transition out of the spiral from the perspective of its topological defects .",
    "these are the well - known point - like @xmath1 vortices in two spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "if the spiral is destroyed without proliferating these vortices a gapped @xmath1 spin liquid with fractionalized bosonic spinon excitations emerges and the resulting transition is rather well understood the transition is described in terms of the condensation of the bosonic spinons , while the visons remain gapped throughout ; the critical point belongs to @xmath3 universality class @xcite .",
    "however , the more conventional transition out of the spiral is driven by proliferating the @xmath1 vortices , such that both the spinons and the visons become critical at the transition . what is the nature of the resulting paramagnet and the associated transition",
    "this is the fundamental question that we will formulate an answer to in this paper .",
    "we will argue that the quantum berry phase effects lead to vbs order in such paramagnets and the associated transition may be generically second ordered . a schematic picture for a quantum phase transition between the spiral and the dimer is shown in fig .",
    "[ figlat ] . in this paper",
    "we shall outline the general structure of the field theory for a generic continuous transition between the two phases and work out an example in context of a lattice model .",
    "we emphasize that the theory developed here can capture similar transitions on other lattices .",
    "examples of such extensions are considered towards the end of this paper . as pointed out earlier , since the spiral and the vbs break different incompatible symmetries of the hamiltonian , a generic second order transition between them is an example of violation of the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson@xcite theory phase transitions .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin , in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , by briefly reviewing some of the motivations that exists for studying quantum phase transitions out of spiral magnets .",
    "there are a number of numerical studies of frustrated spin-@xmath2 quantum magnets on a square lattice .",
    "most pertinent to this paper are the exact diagonalization calculations on the  @xmath4 \" model on a square lattice @xcite . over a range of @xmath5 ( see below ) the system orders into a spiral pattern . in a different , though proximate , range a paramagnetic ground state apparently obtains .",
    "this later state is believed to have vbs order .",
    "similarly , as we argue below , the same model on a rectangular lattice possibly has a direct quantum phase transition between the spiral and the vbs .    to construct the critical theory",
    ", we find it convenient to start from the spiral phase and consider disordering it by proliferating its defects . to this end",
    "we discuss different aspects of the spiral order parameter in sec .",
    "[ sec2]the order parameter manifold and its topological defects , the @xmath1 vortices .",
    "it is known that such vortices carry non - trivial berry phases .",
    "the role of the vortices in the transition is effectively captured using the well - known spinon parametrization of the spiral order parameter .",
    "this is introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2b ] .",
    "the lattice field theory consistent with different symmetries of the problem is then written down in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and different limits of this theory are discussed .",
    "it is shown that in presence of the berry phase , the paramagnet obtained by proliferation of the @xmath1 vortices is indeed dimerized .",
    "the critical theory , containing both soft spinon and vison modes , is discussed in sec .",
    "the spinons and the visons see each other as source of @xmath6-flux ( mutual semions ) .",
    "this arbitrarily long range statistical interaction between them is implemented through a mutual ising chern - simmons interaction term . after a series of transformations",
    ", the final theory is written down in terms the spinons coupled to a @xmath7 gauge field .",
    "the gauge field is compact and the vbs order parameter is proportional to the monopole operator of the gauge field .",
    "the critical theory contains doubled - monopole operators where the gauge flux changes by @xmath8 .",
    "however , combining available analytical and numerical results , we argue that this doubled - monopoles are dangerously irrelevant right at the critical point , _ i.e. _ , while they are relevant in the paramagnetic phase , they are irrelevant at the critical point .",
    "thus the gauge field is rendered non - compact at the critical point .",
    "this field theory , expected to describe the critical point , is an anisotropic version of the @xmath9 field theories ( see below ) .",

    "the ellipses denote other spin rotation invariant interactions that may be tuned to drive the phase transition between the spin ordered and the paramagnetic phases . though our formulation is generically applicable to all cases of direct and continuous quantum phase transition between the spiral and the dimer , here , for concreteness , we consider a simple lattice model to illustrate our results .",
    "extensions of these ideas to other relevant lattice systems are quite straight forward and indicated towards the end of the paper .",

    "the presence of the latter leads to frustration of exchange interactions .",

    "one has decoupled spin chains with nearest and next nearest neighbour couplings , where , it is known that for @xmath24 there is power - law neel order , while above this true long range vbs order is obtained @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath25 represents an isotropic square lattice with nearest and third nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "numerical results @xcite suggest that this has at least three phases . for @xmath26",
    "the usual collinear neel state obtains while for @xmath27 the ground state shows non - collinear spiral order . at intermediate values",
    "one gets a paramagnet which possibly breaks lattice symmetry , _ i.e. _ a vbs state .",
    "imagine sitting in the spiral phase at @xmath28 ( by choosing @xmath29 ) . what happens if @xmath10 is decreased towards zero",
    "? clearly decreasing @xmath10 increases quantum fluctuations so that the spiral order will be destroyed below some critical @xmath30 .",
    "for very small @xmath10 the vbs order of the decoupled chains will persist as columnar dimer order with a 2-fold degenerate ground state .",
    "could this vbs state persist all the way up to @xmath30 ?",
    "if so could the resulting transition be second order ? while the first question can only be answered by detailed numerical studies of this particular microscopic model in future we will formulate an answer to the second one in this paper .",
    "having established the setting we now look at the spiral phase and consider disordering it through proliferation and condensation of its defects .",
    "consider a magnetically ordered phase where the average spin orientations are coplanar .",
    "such a spin pattern is characterized by @xmath31 where , @xmath32 is the ordering vector which may be commensurate or incommensurate with the underlying lattice structure . for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 being an integer )",
    "the spin order is non - collinear and the forms a spiral pattern ( as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 are two mutually orthogonal unit vectors , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37 here @xmath38",
    ". the main difference between the collinear and spiral order parameter is that in the former only a single unit vector ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) is sufficient , while the latter requires both @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the spiral order parameter is then given by an @xmath41 matrix @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this difference in the order parameter manifold has several important consequences , the foremost being three spin - wave modes in the spiral phase compared to two in the collinear phase .",
    "another feature , which is central to this paper , is the fact that topological defects of the spiral are distinct from that of the collinear neel order . for the spiral phase",
    ", the order parameter has the symmetry of three - dimensional rotation group @xmath41 .",
    "the order parameter manifold is isomorphic to @xmath43 , which is an unit sphere in 4-dimensional space whose antipodal points are identified .",
    "thus the order parameter space is _ compact _ and _ doubly connected _  @xcite .    in two spatial dimensions ,",
    "this allows topologically stable point vortices that are characterized by a @xmath1 quantum number@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denotes the first and second homotopy groups respectively @xcite .",
    "these @xmath1 vortices are distinct from the o(2 ) point vortices in a familiar two - dimensional @xmath47-model . in case of the @xmath1 vortices",
    ", they can have a winding number which is either 0 or 1 ( i.e. the winding number is defined modulo 2 ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that there are only two classes of closed path in the @xmath43 manifold and all closed paths can grouped in one of these two classes .",
    "hence , the @xmath1 vortices are characterized by an ising quantum number .",
    "two such vortices can annihilate each other .    in the ordered phase the energy of a single vortex diverges logarithmically with the system size and free vortices are absent .",
    "however the vortices play a crucial role when the spiral order is destroyed by condensing them . to this end",
    "it will be extremely useful to set up an effective description of the spiral and proximate paramagnetic phases that captures easily the role of the @xmath1 vortices .",
    "the formulation in terms of @xmath48 along with the constraints ( eq . [ eqnnconst ] ) is not convenient for this purpose .",
    "instead it is useful to introduce an alternative parameterization of the spiral order parameter .",
    "we introduce the well - known redundant description of the order parameter in terms of the spinon variables .",
    "specifically we write @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50s are the three pauli matrices and @xmath51 is the two dimensional completely antisymmetric matrix @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is the two component complex spinon field with unit norm , _ i.e. _ , @xmath54 the spinons are thus bosons that transform as spin-1/2 under spin rotations .",
    "we note that the spinons defined here are related to the caley - klein parameters ( which in turn are related to the euler angles ) used in describing the motion of a classical rigid body @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is useful to consider the global symmetries of the effective action written in terms of the spinon fields",
    ". the action must be invariant under global su(2 ) spin rotation under which the spinons transform as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an @xmath57 matrix .",
    "in addition there are several other discrete symmetries of the hamiltonian- various lattice transformations and time reversal . for a rectangular lattice ,",
    "the transformations of the spinon under these symmetries are given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents unit translation along * a * , @xmath60 denotes reflection about an axis of symmetry of the lattice , @xmath61 denotes inversion of the lattice and @xmath62 denotes time reversal .",
    "the translation symmetry implies that the continuum theory has an extra @xmath7 symmetry along with the spin @xmath57 and other discrete symmetries .",
    "the spinon parameterization is _ two - to - one _ and there is a discrete @xmath63 gauge symmetry corresponding to the change of sign of the @xmath64 fields _ independently _ at each site @xmath65 which leaves the order parameter invariant .",
    "this reiterates the fact , in terms of the spinons , that the order parameter manifold is @xmath43 .    around a vortex",
    "the order parameter fields @xmath66 are single valued .",
    "however the spinon fields , @xmath67 , changes sign .",
    "thus the spinon wave function changes its sign on going around a vortex .",
    "in other words the spinons and the @xmath1 vortices see each other as sources of @xmath6 flux .    following lammert _",
    "et al._@xcite , a fruitful description of the vortices is now achieved by introducing an ising gauge field @xmath68 , minimally coupled to the spinons , on the links of the direct lattice .",
    "the @xmath1-vortices are then associated with the magnetic flux of a @xmath1 gauge field @xmath69 where the product is taken over the links of the plaquette of the ising gauge field .",
    "@xmath70 indicates the presence(absence ) of a vison inside the plaquette .",
    "it is important to note @xcite that visons are well defined excitations even in the paramagnetic phase . here",
    ", the spinon fields fluctuate wildly and so does their corresponding paths in the order parameter space .",
    "however , for spinons describing a closed loop around a vison , the paths necessarily end at diametrically opposite points in order parameter manifold ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the above classical picture must be augmented with the correct quantum berry phase term .",
