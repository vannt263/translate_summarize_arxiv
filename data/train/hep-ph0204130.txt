    "it is well known that the observables in the lepton - lepton scattering have less uncertainties than in the lepton - hadron or hadron - hadron cases .",
    "this is because gauge models only specify the lepton - quark or quark - quark vertices , and some parton model assumptions of hadron structure must be invoked to relate the lepton - quark and quark - quark interactions with the lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron ones , and this implies in introducing some uncertainties in the calculation .    in particular , the appealing features for studying the parity - violating asymmetries between the scattering of left- and right - handed polarized electrons on a variety of fixed targets ( @xmath2 )",
    "were pointed out some years ago by derman and marciano  @xcite , and they were systematically studied in lepton - lepton scattering for both fixed target ( @xmath2 ) and collider ( @xmath3 ) experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the left - right asymmetry is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the differential cross section for one right ( left)-handed lepton @xmath6 scattering on an unpolarized lepton @xmath6 .",
    "another interesting possibility is the case when both leptons are polarized .",
    "we can define an asymmetry @xmath7 in which one beam is always in the same polarization state , say right - handed , and the other is either right- or left - handed polarized ( similarly we can define @xmath8 ) : @xmath9    we can define also an asymmetry when one incident particle is right- handed and the other is left - handed and the final states are right- and left or left- and right - handed : @xmath10 or similarly , @xmath11 .",
    "all of these asymmetries can be calculated for both fixed target and colliders experiments . for more details on the notation",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the appealing features of this type of measurement , following  @xcite , are : @xmath12 the asymmetry is manifestly parity violating : therefore its measurement determines the electron s parity violation weak neutral current interaction with the target or with the other beam in the case of colliders .",
    "@xmath13 because the effect investigated is due to the interference between the weak and electromagnetic amplitudes , the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath14 and hence larger than the usual weak interaction effects which are @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 since the asymmetry is a ratio , uncertainties ( theoretical and experimental ) which are common to both the numerator and denominator cancel out and therefore we can use them to perform precision measurements in the context of the standard model  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : precision ] ) .",
    "@xmath17 finally , this kind of interference measurements determines the relative sign between the weak and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "unified gauge theories give unique predictions for this algebraic sign ; therefore their determination provides an additional check on various models- i.e. some models may predict the correct magnitude for the asymmetries , but the wrong sign ! ( see section  [ sec : new ] ) . for fixed target experiments , in @xmath18 scattering a very intense polarized electron beam inciding on an unpolarized hydrogen target while in @xmath19 scattering it is considered an inciding unpolarized muon beam on polarized electron target .",
    "there are some advantages in considering asymmetries in @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering .",
    "firstly , although in fixed target experiment the value of @xmath20 asymmetry is small ( see below ) , the cross sections of these processes are large allowing for a good statistic and , on the other hand , in collider experiments the asymmetry is large but cross sections are small . secondly , in @xmath21 scattering",
    "the background contribution from @xmath22 scattering is less severe because one could trigger on a single scattered electron which could not have arisen from a @xmath22 collision .",
    "besides in the @xmath19 case that muon beams generally have energies at least one order of magnitude greater than the electron beams .",
    "we would like to point out that these asymmetries could be already measured in existing fixed target experiments like e158  @xcite and na47  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we have being interested in these asymmetries in collider experiments since in the future we hope that colliders like the so called next linear collider ( nlc )  @xcite or the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite could work in the @xmath18 mode and the first muon collider ( fmc )  @xcite could work in @xmath23 modes and hybrid collider could do well in @xmath21 scattering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the usefulness of the measurements of these asymmetries in collider and fixed target experiments are discussed briefly in section  [ sec : precision ] ; while `` new physics '' in section  [ sec : new ] .",
    "our conclusion are given in the last section , [ sec : con ] .",
    "at present only a couple of observables differ from the prediction of the standard model at the level of 3 standard deviations  @xcite : the value of the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath24 in @xmath25 , and the value of @xmath26 obtained from the ratios of the charged and neutral currents in neutrino - nucleon scattering  @xcite .",
    "hence a better measurement of the weak mixing angle in process different from @xmath25 and @xmath27 scattering has become mandatory .",
    "this could be the left - right asymmetries in @xmath18 .    in the standard electroweak model the @xmath28 asymmetry at the tree level in fixed target experiment",
    "is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "in the eq .",
    "( [ assi0 ] ) the approximation @xmath32 was used , and if @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) we obtain the following value  @xcite @xmath36 marciano and czarnecki , ref .",
    "@xcite have calculated the one loop electroweak radiative corrections and found a rather substantial @xmath37 reduction of the tree level prediction .",
    "we have also verified that @xmath38 , in fixed target experiments , is sensitive to the value of @xmath1 . in this case the @xmath20 asymmetry , for @xmath39 , is given by  @xcite : @xmath40 if we consider a fixed target experiment with @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 is the muon beam energy , a 0.5% change in the @xmath38 value corresponds to a 0.04% change in @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a change from @xmath44 to @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "this fact show that it could be useful for doing very precise electroweak studies in this kind of experiment too .",
    "more recently it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the asymmetry @xmath28 in colliders experiments can be used to measure @xmath46 rather precisely . here we will briefly discuss the @xmath20 asymmetry for colliders experiments , for more details see refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we plot the @xmath20 as function of @xmath47 to both @xmath48 and @xmath21 colliders .",
    "the results for other values of @xmath49 are shown in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "we see that the weak mixing angle is more sensitive to that asymmetry for the @xmath19 scattering .",
    "it is clear that in the case of @xmath48 we need to measure @xmath20 with more precision than in the case @xmath21 to have the same variation in @xmath47 at the energies @xmath50 and @xmath51 tev . in the case of @xmath52 tev",
    "we need the same precision in both experiments .",
    "we should stress that the results for @xmath23 scattering are the same as in the case of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "as we have shown on this section the standard model implies a predictable degree of parity violation in lepton - lepton scattering , ranging from low energy phenomena to high energy , and we can use them to do very precise tests of the model .",
    "of course , such sensitivity implies that a measurement of @xmath20 is also a good probe of `` new physics '' if it really exists , as we will show on the next section .",
    "in general the standard model is exceedingly successful in describing leptons , quarks and their interactions , it is in excellent agreement with the worldwide data  @xcite .",
    "however , the necessity to go beyond it , from the experimental point of view , comes at the moment only from neutrino data @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos are massive then new physics beyond the standard model is needed .",
    "on the other hand , any extension of the standard model implies necessarily the existence of new particles .",
    "we can have a rich scalar - boson sector if there are several higgs - boson multiplets  @xcite or have more vector and scalar fields in models with a larger gauge symmetry as in the left ",
    "right symmetric  @xcite and in 3 - 3 - 1 models  @xcite , or we also can have at the same time more scalar , fermion , and vector particles as in the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite , or in the supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite .",
    "recently dimopoulos and kaplan  @xcite take up again the weinberg s idea  @xcite that the observed value of the weak mixing angle @xmath53 suggests indeed an @xmath54 electroweak symmetry , for instance models with @xmath55 electroweak gauge symmetry at the 1 tev scale .",
    "the point is that in such models @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being an energy scale of @xmath54 breaking .",
    "this is very important since it means the possible existence of a new fundamental energy scale which is not related to supersymmetry , neutrino masses , unification , or superstrings  @xcite . at this energy",
    "scale new exotic quarks , doubly charged vector bosons and/or extra dimensions may exist .",
    "one way of considering the known quarks with the extra @xmath54 electroweak symmetry model is by embedding it in a pati - salam - type model  @xcite , with gauge symmetry @xmath58 , and with the known quarks transforming only through the first three factors  @xcite .",
    "there is a first symmetry breakdown to @xmath59 , and finally to @xmath60 .",
    "another interesting way to solve the introduction of quarks without invoking a @xmath61 factor as in the 3 - 3 - 1 models  @xcite , is to consider @xmath62 models in 5 dimensions  @xcite .    independently of this interesting fact",
    ", we recall that the @xmath54 symmetry among the lightest particles i.e. , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 could be the last symmetry involving the known leptons or @xmath66 if we add right - handed neutrinos  @xcite . if we impose this symmetry on the electron sector we must also to impose it upon all the other particles and if we do not want to introduce extra dimensions we must introduce extra exotic charged quarks . in this case",
    "it is also possible to have anomaly cancellation only if the number of families is three or a multiple of three  @xcite .",
    "if we accept that the observed value for the weak mixing angle is an indication of a @xmath54 symmetry at the tev level , it means that the respective supersymmetric model has also to have this @xmath54 symmetry , and supersymmetry has to be naturally broken at the same scale and it can also be embedded in theories of tev - gravity  @xcite . any way , all those sort of models involve doubly charged vector bosons .",
    "usually we have several particles contributing to a given observable , and for this reason it is very difficult to identify their contributions in both the usual and exotic processes . in some models  @xcite the contributions of the scalar - bosons",
    "are not suppressed by the fermion masses and they can have the same strength of the fermion  vector - boson coupling .",
    "however , for @xmath18 and @xmath67 scattering , in the @xmath68-channel , the contributions to the @xmath20 asymmetry of doubly charged scalars , like @xmath69 , cancel out .",
    "hence these parity violating asymmetries are only sensitive to the doubly charged vector bosons . in view of this",
    ", we will discuss in this section the role of @xmath20 asymmetry in finding signal for `` new physics '' : doubly charged and neutral vector bosons , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the left - right asymmetries in the lepton  lepton diagonal scattering are quite sensible to doubly - charged vector boson @xmath72 contributions .",
    "the main result obtained is    @xmath73    where @xmath74 .    in the model of the ref .",
    "@xcite there is also a @xmath75 neutral vector boson which couples with leptons .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the non - diagonal scattering ( @xmath21 ) the asymmetries are sensible to the existence of an extra neutral vector - boson @xmath75 , because    @xmath76    hence , both @xmath77 and @xmath75 vector bosons can be potentially discovered in these sort of processes by measuring the left - right asymmetries .",
    "here we should stress that although the results about the @xmath77 and @xmath75 were obtained in the context of the 3 - 3 - 1 model they are still valid in the supersymmetric version of the latter model  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the lagrangian of the interaction between leptons and gauge bosons are the same in both models  @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to stress that the @xmath48 collider is ideal for discovering and studying selectrons .",
    "this will allow to do precise measurements of the neutralino masses and the opportunity to observe and analyze cascade decays of the selectron  @xcite .",
    "we should remember that left - right asymmetries have played key roles in establishing the validity of the standard model .",
    "they will continue to provide valuable tools during the next generation of colliders doing precision studies of the standard model and even more exciting is the possible direct detection of new phenomena such as bileptons , @xmath78s , supersymmetry , and others . here in this work",
    "we have reviewed how the asymmetries , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to perform this kind of study .",
