    "the integration of low - power wireless networking technologies such as ieee 802.15.4-enabled transceivers with inexpensive camera hardware has enabled the development of the so - called _ visual sensor networks _",
    "( vsns)@xcite .",
    "vsns can be thought of as networks of wireless devices capable of sensing multimedia content , such as still images and video , audio , depth maps , etc . via the recent provisioning of an all - ipv6 network layer under 6lowpan @xcite and the emergence of collision - free low - power medium access control ( mac ) protocols , such as",
    "the time slotted channel hopping ( tsch ) of ieee 802.15.4e-2012 @xcite , vsns are expected to play a major role in the internet - of - things ( iot ) paradigm @xcite .          in comparison to traditional wireless sensor networks ,",
    "vsns are uniquely challenging because of their heavy computational and bandwidth requirements that stretch hardware and networking infrastructures to their limits .",
    "hence , an increasing number of vsn solutions were proposed recently , focusing on : new transmission protocols allowing for high - bandwidth collision - free communications @xcite@xcite , in - network processing techniques @xcite and optimized multimedia processing @xcite .",
    "also , several hardware solutions have been proposed , with the aim of finding a vsn platform that could be used for a broad range of multimedia tasks @xcite .",
    "most of these proposed hardware solutions can be abstracted as two tightly - coupled subsystems , shown in figure [ fig : system_model](b ) : a multimedia processor board and a low - power radio subsystem @xcite , interconnected via a push model . within each node of the vsn ,",
    "the multimedia subsystem is responsible for acquiring images , processing them and pushing the processed visual data to the radio subsystem , which transmits it to a remote location .",
    "for example , in a traditional surveillance application , the multimedia subsystem would compress or process ( e.g. , extract visual features @xcite ) the acquired images and push the resulting bitstream to the radio subsystem for transmission to a central controller , where the data would be analyzed or stored .    similar to traditional wireless sensor networks , vsn nodes are usually battery operated . hence , energy consumption plays a crucial role in the design of a vsn , especially for those applications where a vsn is required to operate for days or even weeks without external power supply . in the last few years , several proposals strive for lifetime maximization in vsns .",
    "specifically , solutions are available for energy - aware protocols @xcite , cross - layer optimization@xcite , application tradeoffs @xcite and deployment strategies @xcite . while existing work addresses transmission , scheduling and protocol design aiming for energy efficiency",
    ", it does not consider the impact of the spatio  temporal coverage in the energy consumption of vsns .",
    "this is precisely the focus of this paper .",
    "we consider wireless visual sensor networks comprising a cluster - tree topology , such as the one illustrated in figure [ fig : system_model](a ) , where each camera node processes and transmits visual data to the nodes of the higher tier , or to the low - power border router ( lpbr ) @xcite that can relay the streams to any ip address over the internet for analysis and processing .",
    "moreover , we focus on the case of a _ uniformly - formed _ vsn , i.e. a network of identical sensor nodes that , within each activation interval , are : _ ( i ) _ producing bitstream sizes with the same statistical characterization and _ ( ii ) _ connected to the base station via a balanced _ cluster - tree topology _",
    "@xcite , represented by a symmetric and acyclic graph with balanced bandwidth allocation per link .",
    "each node also relays streams stemming from @xmath0 other nodes of lower tier(s ) . within each node ,",
    "the multimedia and radio subsystems work in parallel [ figure [ fig : system_model](b ) ] : while the multimedia system acquires and processes data corresponding to the current video frame , the radio subsystem transmits ( or relays ) the multimedia stream stemming from the processing of previous video frame(s ) .",
    "let @xmath1 kilobit - per - second ( kbps ) be the average bandwidth at each node ( in transmit or receive mode ) , with @xmath2 indicating the bits consumed by each receiver / relay node over the vsn active interval of @xmath3 seconds .",
    "for example , for a 802.15.4-compliant vsn and @xmath4 second , the average consumption rate would be 250 kbps at the physical layer .",
    "the mac layer of the network is operating under a collision - free time - division ( or time - frequency division ) multiple access @xcite , so that each tier in the network can be configured in a way that simultaneous transmissions in the same channel are avoided .",
    "the number of frames captured by each camera during the operational time interval of the vsn , i.e. each node s temporal coverage , is controlling the frequency of the push operations . at the same time",
    ", the multimedia processing task itself ( e.g. , image / video compression or extraction of visual features ) controls the size of the bitstream pushed to the radio subsystem within each frame s duration . on the other hand , the number of sensors in the same tier of the cluster - tree topology , i.e. , the vsn s spatial coverage , and the number of nodes whose bitstreams must be relayed by each node ( if any ) control the bandwidth available to each sensor ( i.e. , its average transmission rate ) in each tier under a collision - free mac protocol . therefore , there is a fundamental tradeoff between the spatial and temporal coverage in a network : a large number of frames leads to high bandwidth requirement per transmitter , which in turn decreases the number of sensors that can be accommodated within each tier of the vsn .",
    "conversely , dense spatial coverage via the use of a large number of visual sensors per tier decreases the available bandwidth per sensor , which reduces the number of frames per sensor .      in this paper , we derive analytic results concerning energy - aware vsn design under the push model of figure [ fig : system_model ] . specifically , we are interested in the link of the aforementioned spatio ",
    "temporal tradeoff with the incurred energy consumption under well - known probability density functions modeling the pushed bitstream size of image and video applications , such as intra / inter - frame video coding and local visual features extraction and transmission , and make the following contributions :    * we derive an analytic model that captures the expected energy consumption in function of : _ ( i ) _ the number of visual sensors deployed at each tier of the cluster - tree topology , _",
    "( ii ) _ the number of frames captured by each camera sensor within the operational time interval and _ ( iii ) _ the statistical characterization of the bitstream data volume produced by each sensor after on - board multimedia processing . * the extrema of the derived energy consumption function are then analytically derived in order to provide closed - form expressions for the minimum energy consumption of each case under consideration . *",
    "the analytic results are validated within two applications : video coding and transmission based on differential motion - jpeg and visual feature extraction and transmission .    while our results are directly applicable to uniformly - formed vsns , we also indicate how they can be extended to non - uniformly formed vsns with varying statistical characterizations for the bitstream sizes of different sensors and unbalanced bandwidth allocation for the various links of each vsn tier during each activation interval .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : system model ] presents the proposed system model , while section [ sec : min_energy_analysis ] presents the theoretical results ; section [ sec : evaluation - of - energy ] presents real - world experiments that validate the proposed framework under controlled data production from each sensor , while section [ sec : applications ] presents results showcasing the accuracy of the proposed model under real vsn data ; finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "in the following sections we introduce the components of the proposed system model . the corresponding nomenclature is summarized in table [ tab : nomenclature - table.1 ] .",
    "this sets the context for the derivation of the expected energy consumption of each node of the uniformly - formed visual sensor network in function of the utilized spatio  temporal coverage settings .",
    "we consider that the visual sensor network is established under the following two application constraints :    * _ spatial coverage bounds _ ; the number of deployed nodes at each tier of the cluster - tree topology , @xmath5 , is upper- and lower - bounded , i.e. @xmath6 * _ temporal coverage lower bound _ ; the total frame acquisitions , @xmath7 , within a pre - defined time interval , @xmath3 , is lower - bounded , i.e. @xmath8    the bounds of the spatio  temporal coverage stem from application specifics , such as : the cost of installing and maintaining visual sensors , the minimum and maximum spatial coverage required for the area to be monitored , and the minimum number of frames that allows for visual data gathering and analysis with sufficient temporal resolution within @xmath3 seconds .",
    "since the multimedia subsystem of each visual sensor produces varying amounts of data depending on the monitored events and the specifics of the visual analysis and processing under consideration , the bitstream size produced by each sensor node in such multimedia applications is a non - deterministic quantity .",
    "therefore , the bitstream size produced when each visual node processes @xmath7 frames within an activation interval is a random variable ( rv ) , @xmath9 , characterized by its probability density function ( pdf ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "since the underlying processes deriving this bitstream may not be stationary and/or this data may include multi - rate channel codes ( or retransmissions ) to alleviate channel impairments due to propagation and other environmental effects of transmission , we assume marginal statistics for @xmath12 , which are derived starting from a doubly - stochastic model for the multimedia processing .",
    "specifically , such marginal statistics can be obtained by @xcite : _ ( i ) _ fitting pdfs to sets of past measurements of bitstream sizes transmitted by each sensor , with the statistical moments ( parameters ) of such distributions characterized by another pdf ; _ ( ii ) _ integrating over the parameter space to derive the final form of @xmath12 .",
    "for example , if the bitstream size is modeled as a half - gaussian distribution with variance parameter that is itself exponentially distributed , by integrating over the parameter space , the marginal statistics of the data rate become laplacian @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of using marginal statistics for the bitstream size of each node during each activation interval is the removal of the stochastic dependencies to its transient physical properties .",
    "however , in this work we are interested in the _ expected _ energy consumption over a time interval and not in the instantaneous _ variations _ of energy consumption .",
    "thus , a mean - based analysis using the marginal statistics of the produced bitstream sizes is suitable for this purpose .      following the push model of the camera node subsystem illustrated in figure [ fig : system_model](b )",
    ", each vsn node performs the following operations :    1 .",
    "_ acquisition , processing and transmission : _ a new frame is acquired by means of a low - power camera sensor and processed with a cpu - intensive algorithm , realized by the multimedia subsystem .",
    "each frame processing ( possibly including coding to mitigate channel impairments ) produces , on average , @xmath13 bits for transmission .",
    "these bits are pushed to the radio subsystem , which in turn transmits them to the higher tier or , eventually , to the lpbr .",
    "let @xmath14 joule ( j ) be the energy expenditure for acquiring a frame , @xmath15 be the average energy in joule ( j ) required for processing and producing one bit of information to be transmitted and @xmath16 the average energy required to transmit it to the lpbr or a relay node .",
    "different multimedia applications may incur different levels of energy consumption for the production of each bit to be transmitted , while the average transmission energy consumption per bit depends only on the specific radio chip used by each wireless sensor node .",
    "hence , the average energy consumed for acquisition , processing and transmission within the active interval of @xmath3 seconds is @xmath17 $ ] j , with @xmath18 $ ] bits comprising the statistical expectation of the data volume corresponding to @xmath7 frames . 2 .",
    "_ buffering and idling : _ as shown in figure [ fig : system_model ] , each tier of the sensor network consists of @xmath5 sensor nodes that communicate with the lpbr ( or the relay nodes of the higher tier ) .",
    "the set of all receivers ( sink nodes ) of each tier has predefined consumption rate of @xmath1 kbps . under balanced coupling",
    ", each sensor node can transmit @xmath19 bits during the analysis time interval of @xmath3 seconds .",
    "we thus identify two cases : if the amount of data generated by the processing phase and relayed from @xmath0 nodes of the lower tiers is less than @xmath19 bits , the sensor node enters an `` idle '' state , where @xmath20 j / bit is consumed for beaconing and other synchronization operations .",
    "the energy spent during the idle mode of the analysis time interval is : @xmath21 j , with @xmath22 the rv modeling the data rate of a node processing @xmath7 frames and relaying data from @xmath0 other independent and identical nodes [ with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "conversely , if the data generated is greater than @xmath19 bits , then the sensor node has to buffer the remaining data in a high - power , typically off - chip , memory .",
    "letting @xmath25 j be the energy cost of storing one bit of information , the energy spent for buffering during the active time interval is : @xmath26 j. this case introduces delay , as buffered data will be scheduled for later transmission .",
    "thus , the proposed model is suitable for delay - tolerant multimedia applications @xcite .",
    "receiving / buffering and relaying data : _ under a multi - tier cluster - tree topology , each node receives @xmath0 additional data streams from @xmath0 nodes positioned at the lower tier(s ) and relays them along with its own data streams ( see figure [ fig : system_model ] for an example with @xmath27 ) . over the analysis interval of @xmath3 seconds , the energy expenditure corresponding to this process is given by @xmath28 $ ] j , with @xmath29 j / bit the average energy required to receive and buffer one bit and @xmath30 $ ] the statistical expectation of the number of bits received from all @xmath0 nodes of the lower tier(s ) during the active time interval .",
    "in practice , this energy expenditure is dominated by the receiver power requirements , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath25 , @xmath20 and @xmath29 may also include fixed , rate - independent costs of the particular multimedia or transceiver hardware ( e.g. , visual sensor , transceiver or buffer startup and shutdown costs ) . ] . given",
    "that , for ieee 802.15.4-compliant transceivers , the transceiver power under receive mode is virtually the same regardless if the node is actually receiving data or not , it is irrelevant to the receiver power whether the transmitting node(s ) used their entire transmission intervals or not .",

    "<S> wireless visual sensor networks ( vsns ) are expected to play a major role in future ieee 802.15.4 personal area networks ( pan ) under recently - established collision - free medium access control ( mac ) protocols , such as the ieee 802.15.4e-2012 mac . in such environments , </S>",
    "<S> the vsn energy consumption is affected by the number of camera sensors deployed ( spatial coverage ) , as well as the number of captured video frames out of which each node processes and transmits data ( temporal coverage ) . in this paper , we explore this aspect for _ uniformly - formed _ vsns , i.e. , networks comprising identical wireless visual sensor nodes connected to a collection node via a balanced cluster - tree topology , with each node producing independent identically - distributed bitstream sizes after processing the video frames captured within each network activation interval . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic results for the energy - optimal spatio  temporal coverage parameters of such vsns under _ a - priori _ known bounds for the number of frames to process per sensor and the number of nodes to deploy within each tier of the vsn . </S>",
    "<S> our results are parametric to the probability density function characterizing the bitstream size produced by each node and the energy consumption rates of the system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results derived from a deployment of telosb motes under a collision - free transmission protocol and monte - carlo  generated data sets reveal that our analytic results are always within 7% of the energy consumption measurements for a wide range of settings . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , results obtained via a multimedia subsystem ( beaglebone linux computer ) performing differential motion jpeg encoding and local visual feature extraction from video frames show that the optimal spatio  temporal settings derived by the proposed framework allow for substantial reduction of energy consumption in comparison to _ ad - hoc _ settings . as such , our analytic modeling is useful for early - stage studies of possible vsn deployments under collision - free mac protocols prior to costly and time - consuming experiments in the field .    </S>",
