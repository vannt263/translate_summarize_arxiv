    "quantum information processing with gaussian continuous variables is a well - established subfield of quantum information sciences today , see e.g. @xcite . quantum key distribution , for example , can be carried out dealing with gaussian states and measurements only @xcite . nevertheless , non - gaussian quantum states and operations are indispensable to perform certain other continuous - variable quantum information tasks , such as quantum entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , or universal quantum computation @xcite . in addition , any bell test of quantum nonlocality that relies on gaussian measurements only necessarily requires the preparation of a non - gaussian entangled state @xcite , while a quantum bit commitment protocol that is secure against gaussian cheating must necessarily involve a non - gaussian resource state @xcite .",
    "deterministically producing a non - gaussian quantum optical state by using the kerr effect is unfortunately unfeasible today because it requires quite high ( called giant ) optical nonlinearities , which are not accessible in the laboratory .",
    "probabilistic degaussification schemes , however , have been shown feasible based on photon addition and subtraction . not being unitary , photon addition or subtraction",
    "can only be achieved probabilistically , that is , conditioned on a particular measurement outcome .",
    "one thus refers to it as _ heralded _ photon addition or subtraction .",
    "the effect of photon subtraction can be obtained by sending a small fraction of the optical beam on an avalanche photodiode and conditioning the use of the remaining fraction of beam upon photon - counting events @xcite .",
    "photon addition can be achieved as the result of a single - photon excitation of the light field produced by parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear medium , conditioning the use of the signal output mode on the detection of a photon in the idler mode @xcite .    in principle , an arbitrary single - mode state can be prepared by applying a sequence of photon additions @xcite or subtractions @xcite that are interleaved with displacement operations ; similarly , an arbitrary operation dependending only on the photon number operator can be generated by using appropriate superpositions of addition and subtraction @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the use of photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum state has been demonstrated in @xcite in order to generate low - amplitude coherent - state superpositions ( schrdinger kitten states ) of traveling light ( schemes that can be further developed to generate larger - size squeezed schrdinger cat states @xcite ) , while the use of photon addition combined with displacements has allowed to generate arbitrary superpositions of the first three fock states @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ability to superpose different sequences of additions and subtractions @xcite has enabled checking of the canonical commutation relations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the enhancement of quantum entanglement that results from adding or subtracting an arbitrary number of photons on the two beams emerging from a nondegenerate parametric down - conversion process , in an attempt to understand the generally admitted  but not systematically analyzed  notion that degaussifying the down - converted beams makes them more entangled @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we provide the basic equations describing the state obtained by adding @xmath0 and @xmath1 photons on the first and second beam of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state , respectively , or when similarly subtracting photons .",
    "section iii is focused on the case @xmath2 , where we can analytically prove that quantum entanglement is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "section iv treats the general case ( @xmath3 ) , and presents an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of entanglement enhancement as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that a subclass of these states ( @xmath4 ) has already been analyzed in @xcite . in sec .",
    "v , we investigate a measure of the non - gaussianity of these photon - added and photon - subtracted states , and show that the link between this measure and entanglement is rather subtle .",
    "section vi is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "we would finally like to remark that , even though we are focussing on addition and subtraction of photons in an optical mode , our analysis applies also to addition and subtraction of excitations in other platforms such as phonons in mechanical oscillators @xcite , or polaritons in atomic ensembles @xcite . in particular , atomic ensembles might offer several advantages over photonic systems @xcite : first , they act as a quantum memory , and hence , the state can be re - used if the addition or subtraction protocol does not succeed ; secondly , generating the two - mode squeezing interaction between an optical mode and the ensemble is not more challenging from the experimental point of view than generating the beam splitter interaction , which means that addition and subtraction are on an equal footing in the laboratory .",
    "our starting point is the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state .",
    "let us call _ a _ and _ b _ ( for alice and bob ) the involved modes , whose boson operators are respectively denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these boson operators satisfy the usual canonical commutation relations @xmath7=[\\hat{b},\\hat{b}^\\dagger]=1 $ ] .",
    "the tmsv state is obtained by applying the joint operation @xmath8 $ ] with @xmath9 , known as the two - mode squeezer , to the vacuum state of modes _ a _ and _ b _ , that is , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . here , @xmath13 denotes the number states defined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 for mode @xmath16 , and analogous expressions for mode _",
    "b_.    our aim now is to study how photon addition and subtraction affects the tmsv state when applied locally by alice and bob . to this end ,",
    "we consider the schemes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the first scheme ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , alice and bob add , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath1 photons to their mode .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the final , properly normalized state can be written as @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gauss hypergeometric function defined as a series expansion @xmath20 in the second scheme ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , photon addition is replaced by photon subtraction , and the output state can be written as @xmath21 with @xmath22 where we have assumed that @xmath23 ( exactly the same expression but interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 holds for @xmath24 ) .    note that here we treat photon addition and subtraction as ideal @xmath25 operations . in realistic schemes based on the beam splitter ( for subtraction ) or the two - mode squeezer ( for addition ) interaction with an auxiliary vacuum mode ,",
    "this is an approximation which becomes exact only in the unphysical limit of vanishing interaction ( e.g , for perfect transmissivity of the beam splitter ) .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the interaction is kept very weak  which then makes successful subtraction or addition events rare , but still frequent enough for applications ",
    "the idealized description is a good approximation @xcite . in any case , we refer the reader to @xcite for a rigorous treatment of photon addition and subtraction in experimentally realistic conditions .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze the entanglement of these states as a function of the number of photon additions or subtractions .",
    "being pure bipartite states , their entanglement is uniquely measured by the entanglement entropy @xcite , defined for an arbitrary state @xmath26 as @xmath27=\\mathcal{s}[\\mathrm{tr}_b\\{|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\}]$ ] , where @xmath28=-\\mathrm{tr}\\{\\hat{\\rho}\\log\\hat{\\rho}\\}$ ] denotes the usual von neumann entropy of the density operator @xmath29 . in our case , evaluating this quantity is straightforward because eqs .",
    "( [ add ] ) and ( [ sub ] ) are in schmidt form , so that the entanglement entropy of the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 is @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to carry out these sums analytically except in the trivial case @xmath34 , where we get the well - known expression for the entanglement entropy of the tmsv state @xcite , @xmath35 which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath36 . despite this absence of a closed expression for eqs .",
    "( [ eadd ] ) and ( [ esub ] ) , we are able to analytically derive their dependence on the parameter @xmath0 for @xmath2 in the next section .",
    "let us restrict to the case in which only one of the modes undergoes photon addition or subtraction operations , while the other is unchanged . in that case",
    ", we will be able to prove analytically that the entanglement entropy , either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , can only increase with the number of operations @xmath0 .",
    "the first thing to note is that the three schemes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] lead to the exact same state @xmath39 with @xmath40 note that this state follows from ( [ add ] ) by putting @xmath2 and using @xmath41 . using eq .",
    "( [ tmsv ] ) , it is easy to prove that @xmath42 implying that alice adding @xmath0 photons on the first mode ( solid - border pink box in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) has the same effect as bobs subtracting them from the second mode ( dashed - border green box in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , up to a normalization factor related to the success probability of the corresponding operation .",
    "( color online ) three equivalent degaussification schemes . starting with the vacuum state , each of these three single - mode operations results in the same output state @xmath43 up to a normalization factor ( i.e. , the probabilities of success are different ) : alice adding @xmath0 photons after the two - mode squeezer @xmath44 ( solid - border pink box ) , bob subtracting @xmath0 photons after @xmath44 ( dashed - border green box ) , or alice adding @xmath0 photons before @xmath44 ( yellow box with dashed - dotted border ) . ]",
    "secondly , it is also easy to check that @xmath45^k \\hat{s}(r ) |0,0\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\cosh^k r } \\left(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\right)^k \\hat{s}(r ) |0,0\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq .",
    "( [ prop1 ] ) as well as the relation @xmath46 . hence , adding @xmath0 photons before or after the two - mode squeezer is equivalent , except for a normalization factor again related to the probability of success of the non - unitary operation .        since eq .",
    "( [ psi_k ] ) is in the schmidt form , the entanglement entropy of state @xmath43 is easily evaluated as @xmath47 in order to prove that @xmath48 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 , we proceed as follows .",
    "the pascal identity @xmath49 allows us to write @xmath50 where we set @xmath51 for @xmath52 by definiteness .",
    "now , using the strict concavity of the function @xmath53=-x\\log x$ ] , we have @xmath54   > \\lambda^2 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty h\\left[p_{n-1}^{(k+1)}\\right ] + ( 1-\\lambda^2 ) \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty   h\\left[p_n^{(k)}\\right ] , \\label{eq : entropic_inequality}\\ ] ] for @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 is equivalent to @xmath57 up to a shift to the right in the fock basis , which does not change the entropy , i.e. , @xmath58 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty h\\left[p_n^{(k+1)}\\right]$ ] , the expression ( [ eq : entropic_inequality ] ) is simply equivalent to @xmath59 for @xmath55 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the entanglement can only increase with the number of photon additions or subtractions when acting on one mode only ( before or after the two - mode squeezer ) .",
    "the non - trivial expressions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 have prevented us from doing an exhaustive analytical study of the entanglement properties of states ( [ add ] ) and ( [ sub ] ) when operating on both modes , that is , when @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "indeed the only interesting property that we have been able to prove analytically is that @xmath64 , that is , for symmetric operation ( same number of operations on both modes @xmath4 ) , additions and subtractions lead to the exact same entanglement , a result already noted in @xcite in the @xmath65 case . in order to prove this , note that by renaming the summation index as @xmath66 , the subtracted state can be written as @xmath67 which implies that @xmath68 and @xmath69 have the same schmidt coefficients , hence the same entanglement .    in the reminder of the section",
    ", we analyze the entanglement of the states ( [ add ] ) and ( [ sub ] ) by numerically performing the sums ( [ eadd ] ) and ( [ esub ] ) , truncated at an upper limit that ensures that the distributions @xmath60 and @xmath61 are normalized up to an accuracy of @xmath70 .",
    "our numerical results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath71 and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath72 .",
    "the main tendency we can deduce from our numerical analysis is that it is always better to perform addition rather than subtraction in order to increase the entanglement , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "this is clearly visible when comparing the density plots in figs .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b .",
    "such a result could be linked to the fact that photon addition seems to increase the state s non - classicality faster than photon subtraction does @xcite .",
    "note , however , that for large squeezing the difference becomes less pronounced , i.e. , @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "it is also important to remark that the probabilities of success of the addition and subtraction schemes are different @xcite , and hence , even though addition performs better for the same number of operations , it might be preferable to perform more subtractions to achieve a given entanglement , depending on the particular experimental scenario .        for symmetric operation @xmath4 , where addition and subtraction perform equally , the entanglement increases with the number of operations , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "this is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , where we plot the entanglement @xmath77 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the studies performed in @xcite .",
    "we also observed that for a fixed number of operations @xmath78 , the entanglement increases when approaching the symmetric situation @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d , where we plot @xmath79 as a function of @xmath0 both for addition ( dark - blue line ) and subtraction ( light - red line ) .",
    "note , however , that the shapes of the curves are rather different for addition and subtraction .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that the optimal enhancement is obtained when the same number of operations are applied on both modes , where both addition and subtraction give the same entanglement enhancement .    by keeping the number of operations fixed on one mode ,",
    "the entanglement is an increasing function of the number of additions on the other mode , that is , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , by fixing @xmath1 to some value , say @xmath81 , the entanglement increases as alice adds more photons ; for @xmath82 this is exactly the analytical result that we found in sec .",
    "the case @xmath83 is illustrated in fig .",
    "the situation is a bit different for photon subtraction . while above some critical squeezing parameter @xmath36 ( depending on @xmath81 ) , the entanglement is a monotonically increasing function of the number of subtractions @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath84 , just as for additions , below this critical squeezing it is not",
    "this is made clear in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we plot @xmath85 for a smaller squeezing parameter @xmath72 .",
    "note fig .",
    "[ fig4]c , in particular , where we see that the entanglement decreases in some interval of @xmath0 above the symmetric point @xmath86 before going back to its normal increase . otherwise , the behavior of entanglement at @xmath72 as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]a and [ fig4]b is qualitatively similar to what we observed at @xmath71 in fig .",
    "the case of photon addition is also plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig4]b and [ fig4]c for comparison .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , we also observe that the entanglement enhancement effected by photon addition and subtraction is greater , in relative terms , when the squeezing parameter @xmath36 is low ( remember that @xmath87 and @xmath85 are normalized to the tmvs state in the figures ) .",
    "for example , at the symmetric point @xmath86 , the entanglement is enhanced by a factor about 3.7 with respect to the tmvs state at @xmath71 , while it reaches about 6.7 at @xmath72 .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the entanglement of the tmsv state is already very large and its schmidt coefficients approach a uniform , infinitely wide distribution ; hence , photon addition or subtraction can not improve much on this .",
    "finally , it is worth comparing the photon - added and -subtracted states , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , from the point of view of the energy cost for generating the same amount of entanglement . for this",
    ", we define the entanglement energy - efficiency of the photon - added state as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the total mean photon number of the state , and the function @xmath93 is the entanglement entropy of a tmsv state with @xmath94 mean photon number ( equal to the entropy of a thermal state of @xmath95 photons ) .",
    "of course , we use a similar definition for photon - subtracted states .    taking into account that the tmsv state provides the highest entanglement for a given average photon number ,",
    "the entanglement energy - efficiency as defined here is equal to one for a tmsv state and less than one otherwise . in other words ,",
    "the efficiency quantifies the degree to which the state s energy is optimally deployed in creating entanglement .    in fig .",
    "[ figeff ] , we plot the entanglement energy - efficiency as a function of the number of operations @xmath96 , for two values of @xmath36 . note that , even though photon addition leads to a larger entanglement amplification in absolute terms as shown before , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figeff ] tell us that photon subtraction is more efficient ( in general ) from the energy cost point of view .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the non - gaussianity of the photon - added and -subtracted states that we have introduced in the previous sections , and investigate the possible link with their entanglement properties . in a nutshell",
    ", we reach the conclusion that photon addition leads to a faster degaussification of the tmsv state than photon subtraction , which is reminiscent to the behavior of entanglement , but nevertheless the level of entanglement found in these states seems to have no direct relation to their non - gaussianity .",
    "we use here the non - gaussianity measure of a state that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this measure has already been used in a similar context , for example in @xcite . there , after a numerical analysis based on this measure , it was conjectured that , at least for the class of photon - number entangled states ( to which the states included in this work belong ) , the entanglement of gaussian states is more robust against lossy channel with thermal added noise than that of non - gaussian states .",
    "note , however , that this conjecture was recently proved wrong by showing that it does not hold when a different entanglement measure ( negativity under partial transposition ) is used @xcite , and that the entanglement of the n00n states and of a simple class of photon - number entangled states survive longer in a thermal environment than the entanglement of any gaussian state @xcite .",
    "let us first explain how this non - gaussianity measure @xmath97 $ ] works for a general state @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to evaluate the statistical distinguishability between @xmath29 and the gaussian state @xmath98 having the same first and second moments , which can be done by using the quantum relative entropy .",
    "thus , we define the non - gaussianity of state @xmath29 as @xmath99&=&\\mathcal{s}[\\hat{\\rho}||\\hat{\\rho}_\\mathrm{g } ] = \\mathrm{tr}\\{\\hat{\\rho}(\\log\\hat{\\rho}-\\log\\hat{\\rho}_\\mathrm{g})\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\mathcal{s}[\\hat{\\rho}_\\mathrm{g}]-\\mathcal{s}[\\hat{\\rho}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality follows from the fact that @xmath29 and @xmath98 have the same first and second moments . here",
    ", the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 we work with are pure , and hence their non - gaussianity is simply the entropy of the corresponding gaussian state , i.e. , @xmath97=\\mathcal{s}[\\hat{\\rho}_\\mathrm{g}]$ ] .",
    "now , let us define the vector operator @xmath100 built on the quadrature operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and similarly for the mode _",
    "b_. it is fairly simple to check that the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 have all zero mean , that is , @xmath103 .",
    "the elements of the covariance matrix are then evaluated as @xmath104 , and it is straightforward to check that both the photon - subtracted and photon - added states have a covariance matrix of the type @xmath105,\\ ] ] where we have defined the @xmath106 matrices @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in the case of the photon - added states @xmath89 ,",
    "the parameters are given by @xmath109 while , for the photon - subtracted states @xmath90 , one has @xmath110 while we have not been able to evaluate the sums in the @xmath111 s analytically , the sums in the @xmath112 s and @xmath113 s have the following closed expressions : @xmath114 where in the second expression we have assumed @xmath115 ( once again , exactly the same expression but interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 holds for @xmath24 ) .",
    "the two - mode covariance matrix ( [ covmat ] ) is in normal form @xcite , from which the entropy of the gaussian state ( and thus the non - gaussianity of the photon - added or -subtracted state ) can be directly evaluated as @xmath116 + g[\\nu_-^{(k , l)}],\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and where @xmath118,\\ ] ] are the symplectic eigenvalues @xcite of the covariance matrix ( [ covmat ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot the non - gaussianity @xmath119 for an arbitrary number of operations @xmath96 with @xmath71 ( upper row ) and @xmath72 ( lower row ) . in analogy with the behavior of entanglement , we observe that photon addition leads to a faster degradation of the gaussianity of the tmsv state than photon subtraction .",
    "in other words , @xmath30 ( dark - blue lines ) is more non - gaussian than the photon subtracted state @xmath31 ( light - red lines ) .",
    "this is clear for example in figs .",
    "[ fig5]a , d where we plot the increase of @xmath120 with @xmath0 for symmetric operations @xmath4 . extrapolating from the behavior of entanglement",
    ", one would be tempted to predict that the non - gaussianity @xmath119 is maximum for symmetric operations @xmath4 for both addition and subtraction .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of @xmath119 is radically different .",
    "while for a fixed number @xmath78 of photon additions ( dark - blue lines ) , its maximum is indeed reached for @xmath4 , for a fixed number @xmath78 of photon subtractions ( light - red lines ) , the non - gaussianity is actually minimum for @xmath4 , see figs .",
    "[ fig5]b , e .",
    "we observe a similar anomaly in figs .",
    "[ fig5]c , f , where we plot the non - gaussianity as a function of @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the non - gaussianity of photon - subtracted states exhibits , in some situations , a very different qualitative behavior from that of its entanglement .",
    "we have studied how local photon addition and subtraction affect the entanglement and gaussianity of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "this subject has become of recent interest , especially since these fundamental heralded non - gaussian operations have become available in the laboratory .",
    "first , we have analytically shown that the entanglement grows with the number of photon additions or subtractions when only one of the parties performs the operations .",
    "we have then numerically analyzed the case in which both parties add or subtract photons ; although addition and subtraction lead to the same entanglement enhancement when both parties perform the same number of operations , photon addition beats photon subtraction in general .",
    "we have also analyzed the efficiency with which the energy in photon - added and photon - subtracted states generates entanglement , showing that , in general , this can be close to perfect for photon subtraction , but not for photon addition .",
    "finally , we have numerically studied the degaussification of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state that is effected by photon addition or subtraction , showing that photon addition degrades the gaussianity of the state faster than photon subtraction . observing that the entanglement and non - gaussianity of photon - subtracted states have a radically different behavior ,",
    "we conclude that the relation between entanglement and non - gaussianity is not as simple as previously assumed .",
    "future directions might include analyzing how photon addition and subtraction affect the entanglement of more general ( possibly mixed ) states , such as the tmsv state degraded by losses in the channels through which the entangled modes are sent to alice and bob , which is a typical initial state of many distillation or concentration protocols @xcite .",
