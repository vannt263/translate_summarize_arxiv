    "during the inspiral and merger of an asymmetric black hole ( bh ) binary , the linear momentum that is emitted results in a reaction , a `` kick , '' to the final merged black hole .",
    "this kick can be strong enough to eject the merged final black hole from its host active galactic nucleus .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent work discussing astrophysical implications of black hole kicks .",
    "observational confirmations of the predicted `` runaway '' black holes are now starting@xcite .    theoretical predictions of kicks have been based largely on supercomputer numerical computations of the nonlinear equations of general relativity for black hole inspiral and merger .",
    "these codes are now capable of evolving almost any initial binary configuration .",
    "explorations and good guesses have been made that have led to `` superkick '' configurations with very large ejection velocities of the final hole@xcite .",
    "what is missing is a picture of the process simple enough so that physical insights can be used , as they usually are in physics .",
    "this has been a main motivation for the visualization project by the caltech - cornell group@xcite in which `` tendex and vortex '' lines are used for visualization of the relativistic gravitational fields .    here we give a simple and compelling picture of the generation of at least some aspect of kicks , a picture based on the idea that in binary inspiral main features of emission are to be understood as manifestations of the details of trajectories .",
    "what is perhaps most important about the success of this picture is that it suggests that `` trajectory dominance '' may be a key to a phenomenological understanding of binary inspiral emission more generally .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we briefly review the spin - dependent kick - antikick cancellation for equatorial orbits , along with our phenomenological explanation of the cancellation and its spin dependence . section  [ sec : orbits ] then looks at inspiral orbits .",
    "it is shown that the qualitative characteristics of these orbits correlate with black hole spin in a way that suggests that it is the orbital shapes that explain the different characteristics of linear momentum emission for prograde vs.  retrograde orbits , and for different spins . in this section",
    "it is also shown that the root of the different orbital characteristics ( and hence of the kick correlation with spin and orbital direction ) is the relationship of particle orbital angular momentum and angular velocity in the spacetime of a rotating hole . section  [ sec : tests ] then `` tests '' the hypothesis of trajectory dominance with two classes of numerical experiments .",
    "in the first , it is shown that a kerr particle trajectory placed in a schwarzschild spacetime gives substantially the same gravitational wave emission as it does in the kerr spacetime for which it is a geodesic .",
    "the second class of tests is limited to retrograde orbits in kerr spacetimes .",
    "it is shown that the burst of radiation from retrograde orbits arises from the reversal of angular velocity of the inspiral trajectory .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "during the bh inspiral - plunge - merger ( ipm ) the gravitational wave ( gw ) emission carries away linear momentum , and a net linear momentum emission builds up in some direction .",
    "a strange attribute of the linear momentum was noted by schnittman _",
    "et al._@xcite in their computational studies of the ipm of comparable mass bhs , with spin angular momentum perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "the net linear momentum in some direction would grow during the inspiral phase then start to decrease at the plunge . for certain models",
    "the decrease removed most of the momentum emitted earlier .",
    "subsequently , sundararajan _",
    "et al._@xcite studied the phenomenon further with the flexibility and efficiency of particle perturbation techniques .",
    "their results , for `` particles '' orbiting in the equatorial plane of a spinning black hole , included models in which 97% of the kick was cancelled by a late term antikick . it was noted in these studies that the extent of cancellation is strongly correlated with black hole spin and strongly dependent on whether the orbital motion is prograde ( orbital and spin angular momentum aligned ) or retrograde ( antialigned ) .",
    "we shall call this puzzling cancellation , along with its dependence on the orbit and the bh spin , the `` cancellation phenomenon . ''",
    "this phenomenon was somewhat a paradox .",
    "the early momentum emission comes from the nearly newtonian gradual inspiral , while the late emission is from the plunge and the quasinormal ringing of the merger .",
    "it seemed remarkable that the early process could somehow `` set up '' the late process to generate just the right amount of linear momentum so that for some models the late momentum emission almost completely cancelled the early emission .",
    "as is so often the case for an `` impossible '' coincidence , the explanation turns out to be simple , at least at one level . for prograde orbits the component of linear momentum flux in any direction ,",
    "let us say the @xmath0 in the @xmath1-direction , is an oscillating quantity .",
    "this oscillating quantity starts with negligible amplitude in the distant past , in effect at time @xmath2 ; it ends with zero amplitude at @xmath3 , when the quasinormal ringing dies out .",
    "thus , as a function of time , @xmath0 is an oscillation inside a modulation envelope that starts and ends at zero , and is largest around the plunge .    the net momentum @xmath4 radiated up to some time @xmath5 is the integral of @xmath0 from early time up to time @xmath5 .",
    "the total @xmath4 radiated for the entire ipm process , @xmath6 is the integral of an oscillating quantity . in that integral",
    ", the positive phases and negative phases of the oscillation will tend to cancel .",
    "due to the changing amplitude of the oscillations the cancellation will not be complete ; some net momentum can be radiated .",
    "the more rapidly the amplitude changes , the larger the result for the total momentum radiated .",
    "the total momentum in fact is easily shown to be a decreasing function of the characteristic time scale for the change in the amplitude divided by the characteristic period of the oscillations .",

    "the momentum flux is oscillatory inside an amplitude envelope that is moderately smooth .",

    "the jump in radiated momentum is more sudden than for @xmath8 in the case of the retrograde orbit , and the cancellation of the radiated momentum is more nearly total than for @xmath8 in the case of the prograde orbit .    in seeking an explanation for this cancellation",
    ", an important technical question must be asked .",
    "linear momentum can not be generated in a single multipole mode .",
    "its emission therefore depends on delicate amplitude and phase relations of different modes ( in fact , the relations of even modes with odd modes ) .",
    "we must ask whether the bh spin dependence , and the very different patterns for retrograde and prograde orbts are the results of subtly shifting mode interactions , or whether they are embedded more robustly in the gravitational wave emission .",
    "this question is answered in fig .  [",
    "fig : wave2s ] . here",
    "the @xmath17 part of the teukolsky function @xmath11 is shown for retrograde and prograde orbits both for @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear in these figures that what is seen in the linear momentum flux is also true for the gravitational waves themselves : for retrograde orbits the wave emission comes in a burst , while for prograde emission the emission is a smoothly modulated oscillation , and these characteristics increase with increasing values of @xmath18 .",
    "we emphasize that the observations above are phenomenological and hence our explanation in paper i of the kick / antikick cancellation is a phenomenological one , one that is clearly compelling , but that does not really _ explain _ the cancellation , since it does not explain why the prograde orbits have slowly changing oscillations and the retrograde orbits have rapidly changing oscillations .",
    "we offer such an explanation in this paper , and hence show the underlying physical explanation of the linear momentum cancellation phenomenon .",
    "the core of our explanation lies in the fact that a rotating hole drags spacetime along with it . in the schwarzschild spacetime ,",
    "the angular velocity @xmath19 of a particle of mass @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 , the particle s specific angular momentum ( @xmath22 ) , a constant of the motion . in the kerr spacetime ,",
    "however , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the particle s specific energy ( -@xmath25 ) , another constant of the motion . due to the terms linear in @xmath26 in this expression , a particle with no angular momentum can be rotating , i.e. , can have nonzero @xmath19 .",
    "it is of particular interest that for a particle with a nonzero @xmath21 that has sign opposite to that of @xmath26 , the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dphidt ] ) can vanish and , since the two cancelling terms have different @xmath27 dependences , can change sign as the particle moves inward . in short ,",

    "@xcite . for a particle of mass @xmath20 moving in the spacetimes of mass @xmath31 ,",
    "the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum are second order in @xmath32 .",
    "it is assumed that these losses are slow enough that the orbits can be described as geodesics in which the particle energy and angular momentum decrease slowly in accord with radiative losses . for all models reported in the current paper , the mass ratio is @xmath33 , so that the assumption of slow rate of change is justified .    due to this radiation reaction",
    ", the particle gradually spirals inward from the isco .",
    "once it has been driven well off the isco , radiation reaction is unimportant . following a short transition from the earlier adiabatic inspiral@xcite , the motion is negligibly different from an infalling geodesic as the particle moves inward on a spiral that ends at the horizon .",
    "this motion is associated with the gw emission at @xmath34 .",
    "it is striking in fig .",
    "[ fig : all6 ] that the particle moving in the prograde direction into the @xmath10 hole orbits many times and slowly moves inward .",
    "this characteristic is less dramatic in the @xmath35 case .",
    "the tendency is yet less in the @xmath36 case , the orbit for a schwarzschild hole .",
    "for the retrograde orbits , quite the opposite applies ; as the bh spin magnitude increases the orbit becomes less and less dominated by circumferential motion and more and more by radial motion .",
    "a simple quantitative exploration of this correlation is possible .",
    "since radiation reaction at and interior to the isco is much smaller than the secular gravitational forces ( i.e. , since the trajectories are negligibly different from geodesic orbits ) it is a good approximation to set the @xmath21 and @xmath24 parameters for infall to be those at the isco .",
    "these are known to give a ratio@xcite @xmath37 where the upper sign refers to prograde orbits and the lower to retrograde . with this ratio put into eq .",

    "if the angular velocity reversal occurs too close ( in some sense ) to the horizon , gravitational redshift effects dominate to suppress outgoing gravitational wave energy and momentum .",
    "a crude index of the importance of the angular velocity reversal is therefore the ratio of the reversed - motion radial span @xmath39 to the full radial span @xmath40 .",
    "this ratio is shown , for retrograde orbits , in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaratio ] .",
    "is @xmath39 , the radial distance from the turning point to the horizon , and @xmath41 is @xmath40 , the radial distance from isco to horizon . ]",
    "the implications of fig .",
    "[ fig : all6 ] are supported by the results in this figure ; the importance of the angular velocity reversal for retrograde infall increases dramatically with increasing bh spin .",
    "we have so far focused on the retrograde orbits , while it had been the high spin prograde orbits , that produced the most interesting cancellation phenomenon .",
    "we now understand this to be due to the gradual orbiting for prograde cases after the particle has detached from the isco and is spiralling in toward the horizon .",
    "this gradual spiralling is particularly clear for the prograde inspiral with @xmath10 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all6 ] . a suggestion of the physical basis for this can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dphidt ] ) : for prograde orbits , in which @xmath21 and @xmath26 have the same sign , the two terms in the numerator of @xmath19 have the same sign , while for retrograde orbits they would have opposite signs",
    ". this suggests that @xmath19 is larger in the prograde case and that it increases with increasing bh spin .",
    "the situation is actually rather more complicated .",
    "for one thing , @xmath19 for the inspiral depends on radius ; the particle whirls faster ( as measured in coordinate time ) as it approaches the horizon .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : progdphidt ] , along with the dependence of angular velocity on @xmath18 .",
    "we should not lose sight of the fact that @xmath19 by itself does not really determine the kick / antikick cancellation .",
    "rather , the important point is the way in which the amplitude of linear momentum flux changes slowly for particle motion after the plunge , i.e. , inside the isco .",
    "figure [ fig : progdphidt ] is therefore only mildly suggestive of the reason for the increase in cancellation with increasing @xmath18 .     as it spirals from the isco to the horizon .",
    "here we test the hypothesis that the nature of the kick , and of gravitational wave emission more generally , is dominated by the nature of the trajectory , rather than by the nature of the spacetime in which the gravitational waves are generated and through which they propagate .",
    "one way of investigating what dominates , trajectory or spacetime , is to take a trajectory from , say , spacetime a , put it as a source in spacetime b , and see whether the emerging radiation is characteristic of the trajectory or the spacetime .",
    "this procedure amounts to putting into spacetime b an orbit that differs dramatically from a geodesic orbit in spacetime a. this configuration , then , can not be considered to be the extreme mass ratio limit of a process in general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , it is mathematically consistent in linear particle perturbation theory , since the specification of the source in such calculations is an independent step .",

    ", one can start with the kerr trajectory for a hole of mass @xmath31 and nonzero spin parameter @xmath18 .",

    "the plot of momentum fluxes ( as in fig .",

    "what is telling is the time development of the angle of the radiated momentum .",
    "that angle increases monotonically to @xmath62 , which mirrors ( with an appropriate shift ) the time at which the reversal occurs .",
    "beyond this , the angle associated with the flux is roughly constant or even decreasing ( bearing in mind that the flux decays rapidly , and this angle is likely to be dominated by numerical noise as we go forward in time ) .",
    "figures [ fig : trajnflux06 ] and [ fig : trajnflux03 ] show analogous results for the retrograde inspiral into holes of @xmath8 and @xmath63 .",

    "this is due , in particular , to the angular velocity reversal , a feature of the orbit that can be directly connected to the pattern of radiation .",
    "an interesting working hypothesis is that in a broader class of ipm models the radiation from a particle in a bh background can usefully be broken down into spacetime @xmath64 trajectory @xmath64 radiation in which the spacetime plays a role in the last step only through the horizon cut off .",
    "although such a simplifying picture is most applicable to the emri limit , we note that the kick / antikick cancellations exhibited for comparable mass holes in the work of schnittman _",

    "<S> we showed that the puzzling partial cancellation of an early kick by a late antikick , and the dependence of the cancellation on black hole spin , can be understood from the phenomenology of the linear momentum waveforms . here </S>",

    "<S> this insight suggests that the details of plunge can be understood more broadly with a focus on inspiral trajectories . </S>"
