    "one of the central problems in contemporary theoretical physics is the unification of quantum theory with general relativity .",
    "this problem becomes manifest with respect to the question of the relation between relativistic quantum field theories being formulated on a given minkowski space time background and yielding the conceptual framework of the standard model of particle physics and the general covariant description of space time and gravity according to general relativity . in this paper there",
    "is made the attempt to derive the properties of the structure of space time according to general relativity from a fundamental quantum field theory of spinors .",
    "such a unified quantum field theory of spinors with a self interaction term of the fundamental spinor field being the origin of mass and interaction of particles has been suggested by heisenberg .",
    "we will start from this theory but formulate it in a setting being background independent in a rigorous sense . in heisenberg",
    "s original setting the theory was formulated on a given minkowski background .",
    "in contrast to heisenberg we will not presuppose an a priori metric structure of space time , not even in the sense of general relativity .",
    "the paper is structured as following .",
    "it consists of three parts . in the first part",
    "there is first presented the basic idea of the unified quantum field theory of spinors according to heisenberg .",
    "after this it is given a short introduction to a description of the space time metric in terms of twistors in the sense developed by penrose .",
    "with the help of these ideas introduced in the first part in the second part there is formulated a theory where the metric structure of space time appears as a consequence of a symplectic structure combined with a general connection within the abstract space of the fundamental spinor field .",
    "the action for the fundamental spinor field is formulated by using a metric constructed from a basis of spinor fields corresponding to this connection from which there is also built an action for gravity . in the third section there",
    "is made an attempt to perform a quantization of the gravitational field described in terms of the basis in the space of the fundamental spinor field .",
    "thus the quantum theoretical description of the tetrad field or the metric field respectively appears as a consequence of a quantization concerning spinors assumed to be more fundamental in this approach .",
    "in the framework of relativistic quantum field theories elementary particles are described by irreducible representations of the lorentz group @xcite .",
    "the simplest representation of the lorentz group is given within a space of spinors representing particles of spin one half .",
    "if we refrain from possible supersymmetric extensions , all the elementary matter fields of the standard model are described by spinor fields .",
    "all other kinds of fields like interaction fields with spin one can in principle be thought to be be composed from spinor fields .",
    "therefore heisenberg suggested a unified quantum field theory of a fundamental spinor field describing all matter fields and their interactions @xcite .",
    "the masses and interactions of particles in this theory are a consequence of a self interaction term of the elementary spinor field . in terms of weyl spinors",
    "the postulated fundamental field equation reads    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes a weyl spinor , @xmath2 the adjoint weyl spinor and the @xmath3 denote the pauli matrices with the unit matrix @xmath4 in two dimensions included . the quantity @xmath5 represents a fundamental constant of nature having the dimension of a length .",
    "it is important to mention that gravity was omitted in heisenberg s original setting of the theory which was founded on the postulate of symmetry with respect to the lorentz group and the @xmath6 symmetry group with respect to the weak isospin .",
    "vector bosons of spin one mediating the interactions within the standard model can be seen as states composed by a spinor state describing a particle and a spinor state describing an antiparticle .",
    "this is in accordance with the representation @xmath7 of the lorentz group . in the original",
    "setting of heisenberg the elementary spinor field was a dublett under the @xmath6 isospin symmetry group but not under the symmetry groups @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the strong interaction , which are only approximate symmetries according to heisenberg s theory .",
    "approaches to incorporate the symmetries of the strong interaction and supersymmetry to the theory can be found in @xcite . but",
    "this topic is of no interest here , because we are just dealing with its relation to the structure of general relativity .",
    "thus the spinor can be seen as a multiplett concerning any internal degree of freedom additionally to the spin structure .",
    "the field has to be quantized according to the quantization procedure for fermionic fields postulating anticommutation relations for the field giving rise to the exclusion principle in the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "thus one is led to the following anticommutation relations for the field @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "an interaction process where fermions exchange vector bosons , two electrons exchanging a photon for example , can be interpreted as a particle state interacting with an antiparticle state moving backwards in time and building a composed state before this state splits and there are two separated states representing free particles again ( see figure ( @xmath12 ) ) .",
    "the question if the fundamental constant @xmath5 in ( @xmath13 ) plays the role of a smallest length like the planck length will be considered later if we will have introduced a lagrangian for gravity .",
    "since the self interaction term is the origin of the masses and the interactions described by the standard model , it has in each case to be connected with the electroweak scale .",
    "we consider an abstract complex two dimensional vector space which elements are two component weyl spinors .",
    "the complex conjugated spinor to a spinor @xmath14 in this space shall be denoted with @xmath15 .",
    "an arbitrary spinor @xmath14 can be mapped to a vector in minkowski space according to    @xmath16    let us further assume the space to be endowed with a symplectic structure induced by a skew symmetric scalar product which shall be denoted by @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the property that @xmath17 $ ] is skew symmetric means that for two arbitrary spinors @xmath14 and @xmath18 the relation @xmath19=-[\\chi,\\varphi]$ ] is valid .",
    "the two form @xmath17 $ ] can be expressed by a matrix    @xmath20    implying that the skew symmetric scalar product of two spinors @xmath14 and @xmath18 looks as following    @xmath21=\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta } \\varphi^\\alpha \\chi^\\beta . \\label{symplectic_innerproduct}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath22 can be used to rise and lower indices of spinors .",
    "mapping a spinor @xmath23 to the adjoint spinor @xmath24 with respect to the skew scalar product ( @xmath25 ) means to map the contravariant vector in minkowski space @xmath26 obtained from ( @xmath27 ) to the corresponding covariant vector @xmath28 . the group @xmath29 leaving the skew scalar product ( @xmath25 ) invariant is isomorphic to the @xmath30 and thus to the homogeneous lorentz group giving rise to a relation to minkowski space time . from an arbitrary basis within the spinor space consisting of two spinors according to the two dimensions of the space ,",
    "call them @xmath14 and @xmath18 , a minkowski space time tetrad can be constructed in the following way    @xmath31    according to the relation    @xmath32    the tetrad ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to a metric tensor @xmath34 with signature @xmath35 . in ( @xmath36 ) we have used the fact that we can get @xmath37 from @xmath38 by using the dual spinors of @xmath14 and @xmath18 according to ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "remark that latin indices denote flat indices and greek indices denote curved indices .",
    "if we make the following choice for the basis of spinors    @xmath39    ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath36 ) yield the metric of flat minkowski space time @xmath40 . according to these considerations",
    ", there is a natural correspondence between a two dimensional spinor space endowed with a symplectic structure and minkowski space time .",
    "a more elaborated treatment of these concerns can be found in @xcite .",
    "according to heisenberg we suggest that matter and its interactions are described by a fundamental spinor field .",
    "heisenberg s theory in the original setting is formulated on a given minkowski background .",
    "approaches to incorporate gravity and to formulate the spinor field theory in a general relativistic setting can be found in @xcite .",
    "but there the metric structure of space time is presupposed and the theory is just formulated on a given space time background .",
    "a formulation of general relativity in terms of spinors is postulated in twistor theory @xcite .",
    "there space time vectors themselves are a consequence of a postulated underlying spinor structure . in this paper there",
    "is pursued another aim .",
    "an attempt is made to derive the properties of the gravitational field and thus the metric structure of space time from the properties of the abstract internal space of the fundamental spinor field . at the beginning",
    "we just assume that there exists a self interacting fundamental spinor field @xmath41 on a four dimensional manifold representing space time before the introduction of a metric structure .",
    "the corresponding spinor space shall be endowed with a symplectic structure according to ( @xmath42 ) and ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "if one wants to compare two values of the spinor field at two different space time points , one has to define a spin connection .",
    "such a spin connection , call it @xmath43 , gives a prescription how to do this and it represents the property that it is possible to choose at every space time point another basis of spinors being equivalent to the definition of a nontrivial connection . since there can be chosen arbitrary coordinates , one is led to the connection group @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath44 has the @xmath30 and thus the lorentz group as a subgroup . according to this connection",
    "one can define a covariant derivative @xmath45 with respect to the spinor space    @xmath46    defining a spin connection @xmath43 due to ( @xmath47 ) is equivalent to the definition of two independent spinor fields , call them @xmath14 and @xmath18 , depending on the space time point , building a basis of spinors and being constant with respect to the covariant derivative ( @xmath47 ) which means that they are defined by the following relations    @xmath48    it makes no difference if we assume the connection @xmath43 or the basis of spinors consisting of @xmath14 and @xmath18 to be more fundamental .",
    "both representations contain the information how to compare values of the fundamental spinor field @xmath41 at different space time points .",
    "therefore it is also possible to define the connection by ( @xmath49 ) in terms of the basis of spinors . if @xmath14 and @xmath18 are given , then the connection @xmath43 fulfilling the relations ( @xmath49 ) has the following shape    @xmath50    where we have used the symplectic expression @xmath22 introduced in ( @xmath42 ) defining the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this sense",
    "the covariant derivative ( @xmath47 ) depends on @xmath14 and @xmath18    @xmath51    if we transport a spinor from one point to another , we are according to ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath49 ) dealing with local basis transformations corresponding to a transition to a new value @xmath52 of the spinor field @xmath1 appearing in ( @xmath13 )    @xmath53    which is equivalent to the old value with respect to the nontrivial connection @xmath54 .",
    "the tetrad defined above ( @xmath33 ) leads for all spinors to a metric being proportional to the minkowski metric . in order to obtain general metrics we have to define an extended tetrad according to @xmath55 where an additional term appears being equivalent to the connection expressed with one minkowski space index instead of two spin indices . for the case of a constant basis of spinor fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 corresponding to a vanishing spinor connection the second term vanishes and the tetrad ( @xmath56 ) reduces to ( @xmath33 ) leading to the special case of a flat minkowski metric .",
    "according to ( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath36 ) from the basis of spinors we can construct a tetrad field @xmath57 and a metric field @xmath58 respectively having signature @xmath35 because of the assumed symplectic structure and thus are led to a gravitational field . since the metric is constructed from the connection respectively the basis of spinor fields and since they shall constitute the metric structure of space time in our theory , the general covariance principle of general relativity is related to the arbitrary coordinate transformations within the spinor space . in accordance with usual general relativity our covariant derivative",
    "is defined in such a way that it leaves the two spinor fields ( @xmath49 ) constant defining an independent basis of spinors at each space time point .",
    "since the spinor connection leads to a tetrad due to ( @xmath56 ) and to a metric with minkowski signature due to ( @xmath36 ) , the fact that matter is composed by spinor fields could be seen as the reason why space time has a lorentz structure and thus the covariant derivative ( @xmath47 ) also leaves the tetrad and the metric constant .",
    "this means that we can say that the spinor field is the origin of the metric structure .",
    "this hierarchy concerning the origin of the space time structure , where the tetrad and the metric are derived quantities from an underlying spin structure of a fundamental matter field , is illustrated in figure ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the idea that a connection is more fundamental than the tetrad and the metric respectively is also hold in ashtekar s new formulation of hamiltonian gravity @xcite and the corresponding approach for the quantization of gravity .",
    "but there the connection is not associated with a fundamental matter field being described by spinors .      in the usual gauge description of gravity",
    "( see @xcite for example ) one begins with a lagrangian of a matter field on minkowski space time being invariant under global transformations of the poincare group and postulates invariance under the corresponding local transformations . in @xcite",
    "there has been suggested a spin gauge theory of gravity with gauge group @xmath60 . according to this approach one begins with a spinor field and postulates invariance under local transformations within the space of weyl spinors .",
    "this leads to a spin connection and from this one can define a field strength and thus one obtains a theory being equivalent to the linear approximation of general relativity .",
    "but this theory is not background independent .",
    "it not even supposes that there are perturbations of the flat minkowski metric .",
    "according to the theory in @xcite gravity is a phenomenon completely independent of the space time metric and is instead formulated on a minkowski background given a priori . besides it does not presuppose a unified theory of spinors and thus the interaction with gravity of interaction fields mediated by spin one particles is not included .",
    "in contrast to heisenberg s theory @xcite and the spin gauge description of gravity @xcite we do not assume a minkowski structure of space time and no metric field at the beginning .",
    "it is just assumed that there exists a spinor field @xmath41 defined on a four dimensional differentiable manifold representing space time from which all other fields are assumed to be composed .",
    "this leads to a background independent theory of gravity in a rigorous sense , because the gravitational field is a consequence of the spin connection of the fundamental matter field .",
    "since in our theory we do not assume any a priori metric structure , we can not define an action and then use the gauge principle .",
    "we first have to define the general metric structure with the help of the properties of the spinor space and then we can build the action . thus the fundamental action corresponding to a general relativistic setting of ( @xmath13 )",
    "has directly to be formulated with incorporation of the covariant derivative ( @xmath47 ) containing the connection of the spinor field and on a background @xmath61 respectively @xmath58 derived from this connection respectively from the fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 directly related to the connection ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus we assume the action for the spinor field to look as following    @xmath62    where @xmath63 $ ] and thus @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "note that according to ( @xmath65 ) like @xmath61 and @xmath58 the connection @xmath66 within the covariant derivative @xmath45 depends also on @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "this action and the corresponding lagrangian are invariant under @xmath44 transformations .",
    "the action of the gravitational field has to be composed from the spin connection or the corresponding couple of spinor fields .",
    "in analogy to usual general relativity we can define a field strength tensor @xmath67 ( corresponding to the riemann tensor ) as the commutator of the covariant derivatives    @xmath68 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\partial_\\mu a_\\nu^{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi,\\chi)-\\partial_\\nu a_\\mu^{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi,\\chi)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ia_\\mu^{\\alpha\\gamma}(\\varphi,\\chi)a_\\nu^{\\gamma\\beta}(\\varphi,\\chi)-ia_\\nu^{\\alpha\\gamma}(\\varphi,\\chi)a_\\mu^{\\gamma\\beta}(\\varphi,\\chi),\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{fieldstrength}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 \\equiv ab - ba$ ] .",
    "remark that the connection @xmath54 appearing within the field strength tensor is defined by ( @xmath49 ) and ( @xmath70 ) . from this",
    "we can define a gravity action corresponding to the action formulated within the spin gauge theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned this theory is not background independent and it does not contain a self interacting spinor field assumed to be fundamental .",
    "however , we will use its dynamics in our approach which is shown to be equivalent to einstein gravity with respect to the linearized approximation in @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following gravity action    @xmath71    where g is a fundamental constant describing the strength of gravity and being proportional to the usual gravitational constant g according to the relation    @xmath72    as in the matter action there appear the spinor basis fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 from the connection in the gravity action , which build a basis in the space of the fundamental matter field and define the tetrad field and the metric field . using ( @xmath73 ) in ( @xmath74 ) , the gravity action can be written more elaborately    @xmath75}^{\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi,\\chi)\\partial_{\\rho } a_{\\sigma\\alpha\\beta}(\\varphi,\\chi)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\quad\\left .",

    "the dynamical behaviour of the tetrad field @xmath79 and the metric field @xmath58 is also completely determined by ( @xmath74 ) , since they are defined by @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "if we want to consider the interaction of the gravitational field with matter described by the fundamental spinor field according to our approach , we have to include the corresponding lagrangian ( @xmath80 ) . thus the complete action appears as the sum of the matter action of the fundamental spinor field ( @xmath80 ) and the gravity action ( @xmath74 ) related to the connection and the basis of spinor fields respectively . with this assumption",
    "the fundamental action of nature reads    @xmath81    it is obvious that besides the fundamental constants of special relativity and quantum theory , the speed of light c and planck s constant h namely , which are set equal to one as usual , the constant l and the constant g defining a hierarchy between the action of the fundamental matter field @xmath1 and the action of the gravitational field represented by @xmath14 and @xmath18 appear as the only fundamental constants in this theory .",
    "thus the hierarchy between the electroweak and the planck scale has to be a consequence of the relation between l and g , where l seems to play the role of a fundamental mass scale for particles and g is related to the usual gravitational constant g by ( @xmath82 ) . because of ( @xmath82 ) the planck length representing a smallest length is directly related to g. thus l can not be interpreted as a smallest length according to the unified spinor field theory of heisenberg . since the metric structure of space time is a consequence of the properties of the spinor space of matter , the fact that the action ( @xmath83 ) is invariant under arbitrary transformations of the @xmath44 reflects the general covariance of the matter and the gravity action .",

    "it is one of the central tasks of the search for a quantum theory of gravity to find a general relativistic setting of quantum field theories making allowance for this central principle .",
    "this topic is discussed elaborately in @xcite,@xcite for example .",
    "the gravity theory supposed here is background independent in an even more rigorous sense . in the usual",
    "setting of general relativity the metric structure of space time is not an absolute structure anymore like in special relativity .",

    "since all matter fields live on space time , they all couple to gravity in the same manner .",
    "this is the origin of the equivalence principle .",

    "space time connections are defined by the metric field representing gravity and defining its interaction with matter but being conceptually independent . in the theory suggested here",
    "there is only the fundamental spinor field at the beginning .",
    "the connection of this matter field respectively the corresponding basis of spinor fields are the origin of the tetrad and thus the metric and not a metric field defined a priori .",
    "this is the reason why the principle of background independence seems to appear in an even more rigorous sense .",
    "the metric structure of space time reflects the properties of elementary matter and is not just dynamically related to it due to the field equations for the metric field .",
    "this gives rise to a relationalistic attitude concerning the nature of space time , especially its metric structure .",
    "thus gravity can be seen as a gauge theory with respect to the fundamental spinor field of matter not presupposing a metric structure of space time but being the origin of it . as already mentioned",
    "this is in contrast to the usual gauge theoretic descriptions of gravity .    according to ( @xmath74 ) like matter the gravitational field itself",
    "can be described as a theory of spinors on a fundamental level in our theory .",
    "therefore not only matter but also gravity itself has its origin in a spinor formulation .",
    "this leads to a unification in a very radical sense which extends heisenberg s theory which does not refer to gravity in the original setting . in the sense of ( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath36 ) the tetrad description of the gravitational field although a consequence of an even more fundamental spinor description can be seen as more fundamental than the metric description anyhow .",
    "independent of these considerations the structure of space time as a four dimensional manifold has to be taken as a basic assumption in the approach presented in this paper .",
    "as already mentioned in the twistor approach of penrose the structure of space time as a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional manifold is itself connected to an underlying spin structure .",
    "but there the question of a unified description of matter fields is omitted . in von weizsaecker s",
    "reconstruction of physics @xcite there is even derived the existence of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space time from the quantum theory of binary alternatives leading to spinors also .",
    "it has its origin in deep philosophical reflections about the meaning of quantum theory as a fundamental theory of nature not presupposing the structure of space time as a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional manifold but having it as a consequence .",
    "in the framework of the canonical quantization of gravity ( see @xcite for example ) there is performed a foliation of space time @xmath94 by choosing a spacelike hypersurface @xmath95 and thus separating a timelike direction @xmath96 .",
    "then there is introduced an induced metric @xmath97 on the three dimensional submanifold @xmath95 , where a and b describe spatial coordinates .",
    "the definition of the time coordinate allows to define a canonical conjugated momentum @xmath98 corresponding to @xmath97 by referring to the usual einstein hilbert action expressed in terms of the new variables and thus one is led to a hamiltonian @xmath99 for gravity formulated in terms of @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the approach of quantum geometrodynamics based on these quantities there are postulated commutation relations between @xmath97 and @xmath98 and thus @xmath97 and @xmath98 become operators acting on quantum states @xmath100 $ ] depending on @xmath101 .",
    "after this quantization procedure there have to be implemented constraints to the states @xmath100 $ ] to get the space of real physical states . in the sense suggested by dirac",
    ", the constraints are implemented as conditions on the states @xmath100 $ ] . since in our approach the spin connection of the fundamental matter field",
    "is assumed to be fundamental for gravity and the tetrad and the metric respectively are a consequence of the combination of the spinors representing a basis within the spinor space , the quantization of the tetrad field and the metric field have to be a consequence of the quantization of the more fundamental spinor connection structure connected to the spinor fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to the quantization according to quantum geometrodynamics it makes no sense to consider an induced metric referring to the submanifold describing the spatial part of space time after a splitting of space time .",
    "the reason is that the fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 determine the complete metric whereas the component of the metric with the positive sign refers to the chosen time direction .",
    "therefore there can be specified a time direction @xmath102 without a splitting of the metric .",
    "thus the quantization conditions of @xmath14 and @xmath18 and the corresponding canonical momenta will imply quantum theoretical properties referring to the complete metric .",
    "the canonical conjugated momenta have to be defined according to ( @xmath74 ) in the usual way with respect to the chosen time coordinate    @xmath103    the choice of the time coordinate can be performed according to the usual formulation of hamiltonian gravity because the fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 representing the connection of the spinor field have a metric structure as a consequence with respect to which there can be performed a foliation into a spacelike hypersurface and a time direction .",
    "remark that the time coordinate has no absolute meaning in this context .",
    "it corresponds to this foliation of space time into cauchy hypersurfaces .",
    "the covariance of general relativity is maintained because of the equal status of all possible foliations of this kind ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "there arises the question how the fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 have to be quantized , with commutation or with anticommutation relations .",
