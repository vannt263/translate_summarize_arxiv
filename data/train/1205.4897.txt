    "the oscillations and instabilities of relativistic stars @xcite gained a lot of interest in the last decades because of the possible detection of their gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "especially neutron stars may suffer a number of instabilities which come in different flavors but they have a general feature in common , they can be directly associated with unstable modes of oscillation . in the present work we concentrate our study on the called r - mode instability .",
    "the r - modes are oscillations of rotating stars whose restoring force is the coriolis force . the gravitational radiation - driven instability of these modes has been proposed as an explanation for the observed relatively low spin frequencies of young neutron stars and of accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries as well @xcite .",
    "this instability can only occur when the gravitational - radiation driving time scale of the r - mode is shorter than the time scales of the various dissipation mechanisms that may occur in the interior of the neutron star .",
    "a very interesting problem is the consideration of the effect on r - mode instability due to the presence of a solid crust in an old neutron star .",
    "it is proved that the presence of a viscous boundary layer under the solid crust of a neutron star increases the viscous damping rate of the fluid r - modes @xcite .",
    "actually , the presence of a solid crust has a crucial effect on the r - mode motion and following the discussion of andersson and kokkotas @xcite this effect can be understood as follows : based on the perfect fluid mode - calculations we anticipate the transverse motion associated with the mode at the crust - core boundary to be large . however , if the crust is assumed to be rigid the fluid motion must essentially fall off to zero at the base of the crust in order to satisfy a non - slip condition ( in the rotating frame of reference ) .",
    "firstly , bildsten and ushomirsky  @xcite , found that the shear dissipation in the viscous boundary layer between the solid crust and the fluid core decreases dramatically the viscous damping time in cold old neutron stars as well as in hot young neutron stars .",
    "they concluded that the r - mode instability is unlikely to play a role in old , accreting neutron stars where in hot young neutron stars the boundary - layer damping mechanism limits the ability of the r - mode instability to reduce the angular momentum of the star and consequently to produce detectable amounts of gravitational radiation .",
    "@xcite used different neutron - star parameters to obtain significantly different results for the critical frequency of the onset of r - mode instability .",
    "they found the critical velocity to be about 40@xmath3 lower than the estimate of bildsten and ushomirsky and inferred that the r - mode instability is likely to be the mechanism that limits the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) spin periods and those of other millisecond pulsars as well @xcite .",
    "rieutord @xcite improved the model of the boundary layer and found that the critical velocity agrees rather closely with the original estimates of bildsten and ushomirsky .",
    "lindblom @xcite improved previous estimates of the damping rate by including the effect of the coriolis force on the boundary - layer eigenfunction , using more realistic neutron - star models .",
    "they concluded that if the crust is assumed to be perfectly rigid , the gravitational radiation driven instability in the r - modes is completely suppressed in neutron stars colder than about @xmath4 k and also found that the r - mode instability is responsible for limiting the spin periods of the lmxbs .",
    "recently , wen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the sensitivity of the neutron star r - mode instability window to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . employing a simple model of a neutron star with a perfectly rigid crust constructed with a set of crust and core equations of state that span the range of nuclear experimental uncertainly in the symmetry energy",
    ", they concluded that smaller values of the slope parameter @xmath1 of the symmetry energy help stabilize neutron stars against runaway r - mode oscillations .",
    "vidana  @xcite analyzed also the role of the symmetry energy slope parameter @xmath1 on the r - mode instability by using both microscopic and phenomenological approaches of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "he showed that the r - mode instability region is smaller for those models which give larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "alford  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the viscous damping of r - modes of compact stars and analyzed the regions where small amplitude modes are unstable to the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "they show that many aspects , such as the physically important minima of the instability boundary , are surprisingly insensitive to detailed microscopic properties of the considered form of matter .",
    "the motivation of the present work , in view of the above studies , is to study extensively the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) effect on the r - mode instability of neutron stars with a perfectly rigid crust @xcite .",
    "actually eos affects the time scales associated with the r - mode , in two different ways .",
    "firstly , eos defines the radial dependence of the mass density distribution @xmath5 , which is the basic ingredient of the relevant integrals ( see sec .",
    "secondly , it defines the core - crust transition density @xmath6 and also the core radius @xmath7 which is the upper limit of the mentioned integrals .",
    "we employ a phenomenological model for the energy per baryon of the asymmetric nuclear matter having the advantage of an analytical form . by suitably choosing the parametrization of the model",
    "we obtain different forms from the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy by varying the slope parameter @xmath1 on the interval @xmath8 .",
    "the calculated eos concerns the neutron star core ( from the center of the star up to the crust - core interface ) .",
    "for the neutron star crust we employed the eos taken from the previous work of feynman , metropolis and teller @xcite and also from baym , pethick and sutherland @xcite .",
    "the transition pressure at the edge of the core is calculated by employing the thermodynamic method .",
    "it is found that in a good approximation the quantities connected with the r - mode instability are related directly with the slope parameter .",
    "the effects of the stiffness of eos are studied on the variational and viscous time scales as well as on the critical angular velocity and critical temperature .",
    "finally we investigate the case whether the observed lmxbs should constraint the slope parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii we review briefly the stability of the r - modes .",

    "in addition , the location of the observed short - recurrence - time lmxbs @xcite , title=\"fig:\",width=306,height=268 ]    another issue worth examining is the connection between the observed neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries and the nuclear physics input via the equation of state .",
    "it is a very interesting problem , if it is possible to constraint the nuclear physics input ( for example the slope parameter @xmath1 ) from the related observation data . in general , this a very complex problem since the nuclear equation of state affects in different ways the possibility of an r - mode instability and consequently additional work is needed as well to illustrate further this point .",
    "it is well known that for high temperature @xmath193 k , which characterize mainly a newborn neutron star , the bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism .",
    "however such a kind of dissipation is not considered in the present work .",
    "actually , at high temperature , in a self - consistent treatment one has to consider also temperature effects on the nuclear equation of state .",
    "it is known @xcite that temperature influences not only the density dependence of the equation of state but in addition both the transition density and the proton fraction .",
    "actually the present mdim model can be extended to include also the temperature effect on equation of state @xcite .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "in the present work we consider the effects , on r - mode instability , due to the presence of a solid crust in a neutron star . by employing a phenomenological nuclear model we calculated the equation of state of @xmath0-stable matter which characterizes the neutron star core and",
    "is used for the location of the transition density at the inner edge between the liquid core and the solid crust .",
    "the stiffness of the equation of state parameterized via the slope parameter @xmath1 , was varied on the interval @xmath194 mev .",
    "the gravitational and the viscous times scales depend directly on the parameter @xmath1 as well as indirectly on the transition density @xmath99 . as a consequence",
    "the critical angular velocity as well as the critical temperature depend on the equation of state .",
    "we found also that the instability window drops by @xmath192 hz when the mass of a neutron star is raised from @xmath152 to @xmath195 .",
    "finally we compared the r - mode instability window for the five selected equation of states with those of the observed neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) for @xmath159 and @xmath158 . according to our",
    "finding one can presume that either the lmxbs masses are even lower than @xmath159 or a softer equation of state is more preferred .",
