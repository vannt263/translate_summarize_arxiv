    "the recently discovered state of matter called `` topological insulator '' ( ti ) currently represents one of the most active areas in condensed matter physics.@xcite tis are characterized by an insulating gap in the bulk but at the same time have an odd number of gapless surface modes protected against all time - reversal invariant ( and sufficiently weak ) perturbations.@xcite in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ti , these surface modes correspond to massless two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermions , where the spin direction is in the surface plane and perpendicular to momentum ( `` spin - momentum locking '' ) .",
    "a typical reference material is bi@xmath2se@xmath3 with a bulk gap @xmath4  ev .",
    "the helical dirac electron property of the ti surface state has been experimentally confirmed by spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes).@xcite transport experiments are more difficult in that respect since the surface contribution is often masked by the residual conductivity due to impurities or defects in the bulk.@xcite in thin films made of ti materials , however , the bulk contribution is largely suppressed relative to the surface contribution , rendering the latter easier to observe .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of both the temperature - dependent resistivity @xmath0 and the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath1 ( observable in arpes@xcite ) for a thin ti film .",
    "the approach taken here generalizes previous work for the semi - infinite geometry ( with only one surface ) by two of us@xcite to the film geometry .",
    "this brings about several important changes compared to ref .   that are discussed below .",
    "we model the electronic part by retaining only the dirac surface states obtained from the low - energy bandstructure,@xcite and our theory always assumes that the fermi level is located inside the bulk gap . we note in passing that ref .",
    "provides more accurate parameter estimates as the earlier paper by the same authors,@xcite and we here adopt their new parameters in our calculations using bi@xmath2se@xmath3 as example .",
    "a similar parameter set has been published in ref .  .",
    "in sufficiently thin films , the hybridization of the two surface states eventually causes insulating behavior , as has recently been observed experimentally from arpes for bi@xmath2se@xmath3 films.@xcite for bi@xmath2se@xmath3 , several calculations predicted@xcite a gap @xmath5 with ( as a function of the width @xmath6 ) oscillations superimposed on an exponential decay .",
    "similar calculations , however , found no oscillations , with a well - established ti phase already for @xmath7 quintuple layers ( qls).@xcite using the parameter set of ref .",
    ", we also find no evidence for oscillations in @xmath5 , see sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] below . for large width ,",
    "one then has ( upper and lower ) massless dirac fermion surfaces.@xcite    our working assumption below is that electron - phonon scattering is the dominant source of quasiparticle decay and backscattering .",
    "electron - electron interactions are indeed expected to give only subleading corrections to the resistivity as long as @xmath8  mk.@xcite disorder effects are more likely to compete with phonon - induced backscattering effects .",
    "however , for elevated temperatures , @xmath9  k , phonon effects dominate even for present - day samples , and anticipating higher purity films in the future , this crossover temperature may be lowered significantly .",
    "arpes setups allowing to test our predictions for the quasiparticle decay rate are basically available.@xcite other surface scattering techniques have also been applied to extract the phonon dispersions.@xcite we here follow ref .   and",
    "model the phonons using elastic continuum theory.@xcite since even at room temperature , one effectively probes low energy scales , we keep only long - wavelength acoustic phonon modes . for these ,",
    "previous work on related materials has shown@xcite that isotropic elastic continuum theory provides a reasonable approximation .",
    "the phonon eigenmodes in the thin film geometry and their coupling to electronic modes have previously been determined in the context of semiconductor quantum well structures.@xcite ( note that the semi - infinite case has been treated in ref .  .",
    ") we basically reproduce the phonon eigenmodes of ref .  , but the coupling to the helical electronic eigenstates in a ti film is different from the semiconductor case .",
    "note that piezoelectric couplings are suppressed by symmetry here,@xcite and spin - phonon type couplings@xcite are also expected to be subdominant to the deformation potential taken into account below .",
    "most ti experiments have so far addressed only optical phonons,@xcite cf .",
    "also the corresponding situation for bi surfaces,@xcite but very recently arpes studies reported phonon - induced broadening of the lineshape in tis.@xcite the observed bi@xmath2se@xmath3 electron - phonon coupling strength,@xcite which has been extracted from the prefactor in the high - temperature quasiparticle decay rate @xmath10 , is in good agreement with our theoretical estimates.@xcite this indicates that the low - energy approach indeed provides a reasonable starting point . to the best of our knowledge , no detailed measurements for the temperature dependence of the ti film resistivity have been reported so far .",
    "we mention in passing that for the related case of a 2d graphene monolayer , a similar comparison of theory@xcite to experiment@xcite has turned out to be successful .",
    "remarkably , the electron - phonon coupling observed in ref .   and independently estimated by us@xcite turns out to be quite large . under room temperature conditions , the resulting lifetime of helical quasiparticles is therefore short , and the resistivity is rather large .",
    "this behavior is substantially different from what is found in graphene .",
    "we suspect that this is ( partially ) due to the different debye temperatures in both materials .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
