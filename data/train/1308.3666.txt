    "one of the most robust signatures of pairing in nuclei is the odd - even oscillation in the one - neutron separation energies as a function of neutron or proton number .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 1 which shows the binding energies and one - neutron separation energies for the calcium isotopes .",
    "the figure also shows the results of a shell - model calculation in the @xmath4 model space with the gx1a hamiltonian ( also referred to as gxpf1a in the literature @xcite ) compared with experiment .",
    "the oscillation in the one - neutron separation energies can be quantified in terms of the energy differences @xmath5\\ ] ] @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the one - neutron separation energy .",
    "@xmath8 is the number of neutrons and @xmath9 is the number of protons .",
    "this quantity turns out to be always positive and reflects the fact that the even nuclei are always more bound on the average that the neighboring odd nuclei .",
    "i will distinguish the results for even and odd @xmath8 values denoted by , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . in the literature",
    "one commonly finds the related quantity known as the odd - even mass parameter or pairing gap @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "2.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "i use @xmath13 rather than @xmath14 because its values are more directly connected to simple underlying quantities associated with pairing and shell gaps .",
    "equivalent equations as a function of proton number are obtained by fixing @xmath8 and varying @xmath9 .     shell - model calculation with the gx1a hamiltonian relative to @xmath15ca with filled circles even @xmath8 and open circles for odd @xmath8 , all connected by a line .",
    "the crosses are the experimental data .",
    "the top panel shows the one - neutron separation energies for gx1a and experiment . ]     and e@xmath16(2@xmath17 ) for the calcium isotopes as a function of neutron number .",
    "@xmath13 values are shown by the filled circles for even @xmath8 and open circles for odd @xmath8 , all connected by a line .",
    "the e@xmath16(2@xmath17 ) values are shown by the crosses . ]",
    "2 shows values of @xmath18 for the calcium isotopes ( @xmath19 ) obtained from experiment and from two commonly used effective hamiltonians in the @xmath20 model space , kb3 g @xcite and gx1a @xcite and with a new ab - initio hamiltonian that includes three - nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "i also show the excitation energies for the lowest 2@xmath17 states of the even nuclei .",
    "the experimental data is from the 2012 mass table @xcite together with recent data for @xmath21ca @xcite .",
    "the new data provide a point for @xmath0ca in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 that turns out to the the lowest value for @xmath18 observed in all nuclei with even @xmath9 .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the kb3 g and gx1a shell model predictions . in this letter",
    "i use the shell model with schematic and realistic hamiltonians to understand the trends observed for @xmath13 , and in particular the low value for @xmath0ca .",
    "this will be used to qualitatively understand the trends for minima in the @xmath13 values for all nuclei .    to obtain insight into the reasons for the patterns observed in fig .",
    "2 , i start with the simple  surface - delta - function \" ( sdi ) model for the interaction @xcite .",
    "the sdi differs from the delta interaction by the replacement of the radial integrals by a constant .",
    "the results for @xmath13 obtained with sdi when the single - particle energies are degenerate are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 . the sdi @xmath22 , @xmath23 two - body matrix elements for orbitals @xmath24 and @xmath25 with spins @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath29 is chosen to give a value for @xmath13 that will turn out to be similar to that obtained with the effective @xmath30 shell hamiltonians for calcium .",
    "the excitation energies of the 2@xmath17 states are also constant with the sdi and degenerate single - particle energies .",
    "the results for @xmath13 would be the same if the @xmath30 orbitals were replaced by a single orbital with @xmath31 , but the constant 2@xmath17 energy would be higher ( 3 mev ) .",
    "the @xmath13 value is determined by the number of @xmath32 states that participate in the pairing .",
    "the interaction energies obtained with sdi are @xmath33 for even @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for odd @xmath34 , and thus @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the paired interaction strength for two particles with @xmath22 .",
    "all of the odd @xmath8 nuclei have four degenerate states with @xmath38 = 1/2@xmath39 , 3/2@xmath39 , 5/2@xmath39 and 7/2@xmath39 .",
    "3 shows the numerical results obtained as the shell gap between the @xmath41 orbital and a degenerate group of @xmath42 orbitals is increased from zero to four mev .",
    "the value of @xmath43 at @xmath44 begins to rise when the value of shell gap becomes greater than @xmath45 . in the infinite gap limit",
    "the total original value of 4 mev is divided between the lower group ( 1.6 mev for the @xmath41 ) and the upper group ( 2.4 mev for @xmath42 ) .",
    "when the shell gap is well formed the value of @xmath13 is nearly equal to that of the 2@xmath17 excitation energy . the experiment and calculations in fig .",
    "2 show clear signatures of shell gaps at @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "the gx1a calculation also shows a shell gap at @xmath47 in contrast to the kb3 g and nn@xmath483n models that do not show a gap at @xmath47 .",
    "mass measurements for the more neutron - rich calcium isotopes are required for the experimental value at @xmath47 .",
    "indirect evidence from prodiction cross section data indicates that the the shell gap at @xmath47 is about 0.5 mev smaller than that given by gx1a ( and gx1b ) @xcite .    in order to obtain a dip in the @xmath45 value one needs to make shell gaps below and above a low-@xmath2 orbital",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "4 where there are three groups of orbitals with @xmath3 in the middle split by one and two mev from the other orbitals . in the limit of a completely isolated @xmath3 orbital @xmath49 mev .",
    "the main defect of the sdi model is the lack of oscillations in the @xmath13 values that are observed in experiment . in the 1960 s this",
    "was recognized as a basic failure of the delta and sdi hamiltonians .",
    "it was empirically fixed by adding a constant to the interaction to make the so - called modified - delta interaction @xcite of the form @xmath50 . with the sdi form of the radial integral",
    "this becomes the so - called modified - surface - delta interaction ( msdi ) .",
    "the modern interpretation of this constant is that it comes from core - polarization corrections and three - body interactions .",
    "it is essential to obtain a good saturation property for the binding energies .",
    "the @xmath13 values obtained with @xmath51 mev and with a shell gap of four mev are shown at the top of fig .",
    "this constant simply adds a term @xmath52 to the all energies and @xmath53 for odd @xmath34 and @xmath54 for even @xmath34 .",
    "half the sum of neighboring even and odd @xmath13 gives the pairing contribution : @xmath55 = -v_{o }   $ ] , and half of the difference gives quadratic dependence : @xmath56 = b   $ ] .",
    "2 - 5 in bohr and mottelson @xcite is based upon the @xmath57 combination ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction between protons behaves like the addition of a long - range monopole term in the liquid drop model @xmath59 .",
    "there is also a small anti - pairing addition to @xmath57 of ( about @xmath480.10 mev for @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is useful for understanding the trends in @xmath61 compared to those for @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the msdi model with shell gaps gives a semi - quantitative understanding of all trends observed in @xmath63 .",
    "the low @xmath45 value for @xmath0ca observed in experiment and theory in fig .",
    "2 is due to occupation of the @xmath3 orbital at @xmath64 .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath0ca is @xmath65 mev compared to the calculated values ( in mev ) of 1.170 ( mbpt ) , 0.425 ( gx1a ) and 0.489 ( kb3 g ) .",
    "the key quantity for the effective hamiltonians is the @xmath66 effective two - body matrix element .",
    "it is 0.151 mev for kb3 g and 0.053 mev for gx1a compared to -0.20 mev with the msdi model .",
    "if the @xmath3 orbital was completely isolated its @xmath45 value would be negative for gx1a and kb3 g .",
    "the small positive @xmath45 values obtained with gx1a and kb3 g is due to mixing with the other orbitals .",
    "to go beyond the @xmath30 shell we need to consider global mass models such as the 31 parameter model of duflo and zuker ( dz31 ) @xcite , or the results from more microscopic calculations such as the energy - density functional method with the hfb-21 skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "the dz31 results shown in fig .",
    "5 are in rather good agreement with experiment , but it misses the dip at @xmath64 some parameters of the dz31 model are determined from this region , but grouping of orbitals considered for the pairing is not correct above @xmath44 .",
    "the hpf-21 predictions shown in fig . 6 are rather poor",
    ". this could be due to incorrect single - particle energies or an incorrect pairing interaction .     for all nuclei with even @xmath9 .",
    "values are plotted as a function of the number of neutrons @xmath67 and connected by lines for a given @xmath9 value .",
    "the vertical lines show the location of the magic numbers 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 and 126 . ]       for all nuclei with even @xmath8 .",
    "values are plotted as a function of the number of protons @xmath67 and connected by lines for a given @xmath8 value .",
    "the vertical lines show the location of the magic numbers 20 , 2 and 50 , 82 . ]",
    "the experimental @xmath11 values for all nuclei obtained from the 2012 mass table @xcite and the new calcium experiment @xcite are shown in fig . 7 .",
    "the value for the @xmath0ca at @xmath64 is the lowest value obtained for all nuclei and ties with that of @xmath68pb that has a value of 0.630 .",
    "but if one scales residual interaction strength roughly as @xmath69 , the scaled minimum is 50% lower in @xmath0ca as compared to @xmath68pb .",
    "another relatively low value occurs for @xmath70 at @xmath71zr and is associated with a relatively isolated @xmath72 orbital at that point .",
    "the minima at @xmath64 is only observed for calcium ( @xmath60 ) indicating that required shell gaps quickly disappear . for increasing @xmath9 the @xmath3 and @xmath73 orbitals cross over , and at @xmath74 there is a small minimum coming from small gaps around the @xmath3 orbital in @xmath75ni ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77zn ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "robust minima are observed for @xmath79 due to the @xmath80 orbital and @xmath81 due to the @xmath82 orbital .",
    "all of these nuclei have a @xmath83 spin .",
    "the @xmath84 - @xmath80 gap disappears for carbon ( @xmath85 ) @xcite , and the @xmath79 dip should be gone for @xmath86c .",
    "mass measurements of @xmath87c are required .",
    "the dip at @xmath70 is isolated at @xmath71zr .",
    "as @xmath9 increases the @xmath72 orbital crosses over the @xmath88 orbital and creates a small dip at @xmath89 in @xmath90sn .",
    "as @xmath9 decreases the @xmath72 orbital should cross over @xmath91 orbital creating a minimum at @xmath92 just below @xmath93ni .",
    "mass measurements of @xmath94ni are required .",
    "these experimental trends have been noted previously and compared some hfb models in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 values obtained from the dz31 and hfb-21 mass models are shown in fig .",
    "8 where they are plotted for the same range of @xmath9 and @xmath8 values known experimentally in fig",
    "the analytic behaviour of dz31 is much smoother than experiment .",
    "the hfb-21 results are more chaotic than experiment , but show some similarities in the location of the dips to experiment .",
    "niether of these models predicted a dip at @xmath64 .",
    "the complete set of comparisons experiment for these models is shown on my websige @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xmath95 values for all nuclei obtained from the 2012 mass table @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "9 . there are robust minima at @xmath96 ( nitrogen ) due to the @xmath97 orbital , at @xmath98 ( phosphorus ) due to the @xmath80 orbital , and at @xmath99 ( thallium ) due to the @xmath72 orbital .",
    "the robust minimum at @xmath100 ( copper ) is due to the isolated @xmath101 orbital .",
    "the minimum at @xmath102 ( yttrium ) starts at @xmath103 and is due to the @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath104y all have 1/2@xmath39 ground state spins .",
    "generally the shell gaps are smoothed out by the energy splitting of the nilsson orbitals in deformed nuclei .",
    "but the @xmath102 dip remains in @xmath105y which are presumably deformed and have uncertain ground - state spins .    in summary ,",
    "i have shown the oscillations in the neutron separation energy are described by the modified surface delta interaction .",
    "in particular the @xmath11 value obtained for @xmath0ca is the smallest value yet measured and it due to an isolated @xmath97 orbital .",
