    "seps are high energy particles associated with explosive phenomena occurring in the solar atmosphere , such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "sep events can significantly perturb the earth s magnetosphere producing a sudden increase in particle fluxes and , consequently , in the radiation levels experienced by spacecrafts and their possible crew .",
    "seps constitute a sample of solar material and provide important information about the sources of particle populations , and their angular distribution can be used to investigate the particle transport in the interplanetary medium .",
    "sep measurements are performed both by in - situ detectors on spacecrafts and by ground - based neutron monitors : while the former are able to measure seps with energies below some hundreds of mev , the latter can only register the highest energy seps ( @xmath0 1 gev ) during gles .",
    "new accurate measurements are being provided by the pamela experiment @xcite .",
    "the instrument is able to detect seps in a wide energy interval , bridging the energy gap existing between the two aforementioned groups of observations .",
    "in addition , pamela is sensitive to the particle composition and it is able to reconstruct the flux angular distribution , enabling a clearer and more complete view of the sep events .",
    "this paper reports the analysis methods developed for the estimate of sep energy spectra as a function of the particle asymptotic direction of arrival . as case study ,",
    "the results used in the analysis of the may 17 , 2012 solar event @xcite are discussed .",
    "pamela ( a payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) is a space - borne experiment designed for a precise measurement of the charged cosmic radiation in the kinetic energy range from some tens of mev up to several hundreds of gev @xcite .",
    "the resurs - dk1 satellite , which hosts the apparatus , was launched into a semi - polar ( 70 deg inclination ) and elliptical ( 350@xmath1610 km altitude ) orbit on june 15 , 2006 ; in 2010 it was changed to an approximately circular orbit at an altitude of about 580 km .",
    "the spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized ; its orientation is calculated by an onboard processor with an accuracy better than 1 deg .",
    "particle directions are measured with a high angular resolution ( @xmath2 2 deg ) .",
    "details about apparatus performance , proton selection , detector efficiencies and measurement uncertainties can be found elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the sep analysis reported in this work is based on the igrf-11 @xcite and the ts07d @xcite models for the description of the internal and external geomagnetic field sources , respectively .",
    "the ts07d is a high resolution dynamical model of the storm - time geomagnetic field in the inner magnetosphere , based on recent satellite measurements .",
    "consistent with the data - set coverage , the model is valid up to about 30 earth s radii ( re ) .",
    "solar wind and imf parameters are obtained from the high resolution ( 5-min ) omniweb database ( http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) .",
    "cosmic ray ( cr ) cutoff rigidities and asymptotic arrival directions ( i.e. the directions of approach before encountering the earth s magnetosphere ) are commonly evaluated by simulations , accounting for the effect of the geomagnetic field on the particle transport ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    ". using spacecraft ephemeris data ( position , orientation , time ) , and the particle rigidity ( @xmath3 = momentum / charge ) and direction provided by the pamela tracking system , trajectories of all detected protons are reconstructed by means of a tracing program based on numerical integration methods @xcite , and implementing the aforementioned geomagnetic field models . to reduce the computational time , geomagnetically trapped @xcite and most albedo @xcite particles",
    "are discarded by selecting only protons with rigidities @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 gv , where @xmath6 is the mcilwain s parameter @xcite . each trajectory is back propagated from the measurement location with no constraint limiting the total path - length or tracing time , until : it escapes the model magnetosphere boundaries ( solar or galactic crs  hereafter scrs and gcrs ) ; or it reaches an altitude of 40 km ( re - entrant albedo crs ) .",
    "protons satisfying the latter condition are excluded from the analysis .",
    "the asymptotic arrival directions are evaluated with respect to the imf direction , with polar angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting the pitch - angle and the gyro - phase angle , respectively . to improve the interpretation of results",
    ", the directions of approach and the entry points at the model magnetosphere boundaries can be visualized as a function of the particle rigidity and the spacecraft position .",
    "both geographic ( geo ) and geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinates are used .",
    "the factor of proportionality between flux intensities and counting rates , corrected by detector efficiencies , is by definition the apparatus _ gathering power _",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath10sr ) . in the case of pamela",
    ", @xmath9 is rigidity dependent due to the spectrometer bending effect on particle trajectories since particles with lower rigidity are more and more deflected by the magnetic field toward the lateral walls of the magnetic cavity , being absorbed before reaching the lowest plane of the time of flight system , which provides the event trigger . ] . in terms of the zenith @xmath11 and the azimuth @xmath12 angles describing downward - going directions in the pamela frame : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the flux angular distribution ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the apparatus response function in units of area and the @xmath17 factor accounts for the trajectory inclination .",
    "a technically simple but efficient solution for the calculation of the gathering power is provided by monte carlo methods @xcite . for isotropic",
    "fluxes @xmath9 does not depend on looking direction ( i.e. @xmath18 = 1 ) , and it is usually called the geometrical factor @xmath19 . the solid angle is subdivided into a large number of ( @xmath20 ) bins , with the angular domain limited to downward - going directions . for each rigidity , @xmath19 can be obtained as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the number of generated and selected trajectories in each ( @xmath20 ) bin , and @xmath24 is the area of the used generation surface ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "an accurate estimate of the pamela geometrical factor based on the monte carlo approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "conversely , in presence of an anisotropic flux exposition ( @xmath25 ) the gathering power depends on the flux angular distribution .",
    "specifically , scr fluxes can be conveniently expressed in terms of asymptotic angles @xmath7 ( pitch - angle ) and @xmath8 ( gyro - phase angle ) with respect to the imf direction : @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding gathering power can be written as : @xmath27 with @xmath11=@xmath28 and @xmath12=@xmath29 .",
    "the flux angular distribution @xmath30 is unknown a priori . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that scr fluxes depend only on particle rigidity @xmath3 and asymptotic pitch - angle @xmath7 , estimating the apparatus _ effective area _ ( @xmath10 ) as : @xmath31 by averaging the directional response function over the @xmath8 angle . in case of isotropic fluxes ( i.e. independent on @xmath7 )",
    "the effective area is related to the geometrical factor by : @xmath32    @xmath33 can be derived from equation [ differential_gf_tot ] by integrating the directional response function over the ( @xmath34 ) directions corresponding to pitch angles within the interval @xmath35 : @xmath36    the used approach is analogous to the one developed for the measurement of geomagnetically trapped protons @xcite , but in this case the transformation between local ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) and magnetic ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) angles can not be obtained by simple rotation matrices since it depends on particle propagation in the geomagnetic field ; thus , trajectory tracing methods are necessary . to assure a high resolution , @xmath372800 trajectories ( uniformly distributed inside pamela field of view - fov ) are reconstructed in the magnetosphere for 1-sec time steps along the satellite orbit and 22 rigidity values between 0.39@xmath14.09 gv , for a total of about @xmath38 trajectories for each polar pass ( @xmath3723 min ) . at a later stage ,",
    "results are extended over the full fov through a bilinear interpolation .",
    "since the pamela semi - aperture is @xmath3720 deg , the observable pitch - angle range is relatively small ( a few deg ) except in regions close to the geomagnetic cutoff , where trajectories become chaotic and corresponding asymptotic directions rapidly change with particle rigidity and looking direction ; this ends up increasing measurement uncertainties .",
    "consequently , these zones are excluded from the analysis .             the procedure is demonstrated in figure [ figure1 ] for 0.39 gv and 4.09 gv protons ( left and right panels , respectively ) , at a sample orbital position ( may 17 , 2012 , 02:07 ut ) .",
    "top panels report the distributions of reconstructed directions within pamela fov , with each point associated to a given asymptotic direction ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) ; middle panels show the calculated ( after interpolation ) pitch - angle coverage ; bottom panels illustrate the estimated effective area as a function of the explored pitch - angle range .",
    "effective area results for 22 rigidity values between 0.39@xmath14.09 gv ( color code ) are displayed in figure [ figure2 ] : the peaks in the distributions correspond to vertically incident protons .",
    "figure [ acce_cones2012 ] reports the asymptotic cones of acceptance evaluated for the first pamela polar pass ( 01:57@xmath102:20 ut ) during the may 17 , 2012 sep event @xcite .",
    "results for sample rigidity values are shown as a function of geo ( top panel ) and gse ( middle panel ) coordinates ; grey points denote the spacecraft position ( northern hemisphere ) , while crosses indicate the imf direction .",
    "finally , the pitch - angle coverage as a function of the orbital position is displayed in the bottom panel . during the satellite polar",
    "pass the asymptotic cones move in a clockwise direction and a large pitch - angle interval is covered , approximately ranging from 0 to 145 deg .",
    "in particular , pamela is looking at the imf direction between 02:14 and 02:18 ut , depending on the proton rigidity .",
    "02:20 ut ) during the may 17 , 2012 sep event.,width=398 ]    differential directional flux intensities are obtained at each orbital position @xmath39 as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of proton counts in the bin @xmath42 , corrected by the detector efficiencies , and the denominator represents the asymptotic exposition of the apparatus integrated over the selected rigidity bin @xmath43 . averaged fluxes over the polar pass @xmath44 are evaluated as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the exposition is derived by weighting each effective area contribution by the corresponding lifetime spent by pamela at the same orbital position .",
    "final scr fluxes are obtained by subtracting the gcr contribution from the total measured fluxes .",
    "the gcr component is evaluated by averaging proton fluxes during two days prior to the arrival of seps .",
    "we found that gcr intensities are approximately isotropic .",
    "consequently , the same flux @xmath47 is subtracted for all pitch - angle bins .",
    "statistical errors are obtained by evaluating 68.27% c.l .",
    "intervals for a poissonian signal @xmath48 in presence of a background @xmath49 .",
    "systematic uncertainties related to the reconstruction of asymptotic directions are estimated by introducing a bias in the direction measurement from the tracking system , according to a gaussian distribution with a variance equal to the experimental angular resolution .",
    "this paper reports the analysis methods developed for the estimate of sep energy spectra as a function of the particle asymptotic direction of arrival .",
    "the exposition of the pamela apparatus is evaluated through accurate back - tracing simulations based on a realistic description of the earth s magnetosphere . as case study ,",
    "the results of the calculation for the may 17 , 2012 event are discussed .",
    "the developed trajectory analysis enables the investigation of flux anisotropies , providing fundamental information for the characterization of seps .",
    "it will prove to be a vital ingredient for the interpretation of the solar events observed by pamela during solar cycles 23 and 24 .",
