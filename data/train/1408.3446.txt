    "one of the fundamental problems of quantum field theories in curved spacetime is the vacuum selection . unlike maximally symmetric spaces  such as the usual minkowski spacetime , for generic metrics there is no symmetry argument in order to single out a special , symmetric state .",
    "questions about the meaning of particle states and decoherence of vacuum fluctuations , all too important to cosmological studies , depend upon the solution to this problem to be truly answered .",
    "recently , afshordi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite made a proposal for a distinguished `` vacuum '' state of a scalar field for any globally hyperbolic spacetime .",
    "the physical idea behind the selection was based in the `` causal set program '' @xcite , in which the vacuum state is associated not with a spacelike slice of a globally hyperbolic spacetime , but with a causal set of finite size , parametrized by @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of a new parameter associated with the so - called sorkin - johnston ( sj ) state codifies beautifully the physical fact that measurements of quantum states are inherently finite in space and time , and thus questions related to entanglement and ( de)coherence can be studied from the sj perspective . in particular , the entanglement properties of the sj vacuum could shed new light to the reeh - schlieder theorem . in its original form",
    "the theorem states that the states constructed by local operators acting on the usual poincar invariant vacuum @xmath1 is dense in the whole hilbert space of the theory .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the sj state satisfy this `` highly entanglement '' property .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for details in this direction .    from the dynamical perspective",
    ", though , the proposal meets some technical difficulties .",
    "the green s function on this state does not satisfy the hadamard condition , and as such fluctuations and couplings are difficult to tame @xcite .",
    "backreaction properties should suffer severely from this fact , and the question on whether one could define interactions for the sj state seem now uncertain .",
    "this letter strives to that direction , by studying the coupling of the sj state to two dimensional gravity . in two dimensions , for massless scalar fields",
    ", one has the added structure of a conformal vacuum @xcite , with which one can easily compare the properties of the sj state .",
    "we make use of this structure , as well as the sj state constructed by @xcite to study the stress - energy tensor and the backreaction to gravity via the conformal anomaly .",
    "this will allow us to conclude that i ) the correction term @xcite plays an important role in the renormalized stress - tensor , almost reducing severely the casimir effect associated with the reflecting boundary conditions ; ii ) there is strong gravitational backreaction in the sj state ; and iii ) once backreaction is taken into account , the mirror behavior arises naturally as reflective boundary conditions in the asymptotic induced geometry .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sjprop ] we review the sj construction for the massless scalar field in two dimensions . in section [ sec : trenorm ] we use point - splitting techniques to derive a renormalized stress tensor , and in section [ sec : coupling ] we use the result to couple the field to gravity .",
    "we close with concluding remarks in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "usual constructions of quantum fields in curved spaces rely heavily on the symmetries of the spacetime in order to select a maximally invariant ( `` vacuum '' ) state @xcite",
    ". even when it is applicable , fock space  or highest weight  construction also suffers from the requirement of non - locality , since mode decomposition allows for arbitrarily delocalized eigenfunctions of the laplacian .",
    "these problems motivate the sorkin - johnston construction for a state which can pass as `` vacuum '' for arbitrary ( globally hyperbolic ) spacetimes .",
    "we will limit the discussion to scalar klein - gordon fields @xmath2 .",
    "the sj state @xmath3 is a covariant and uniquely assigned state defined for a real scalar field in a bounded region of a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xcite .",
    "much like the vacuum state in poincar invariant is the highest weight state for annihillation operators associated with the klein - gordon hamiltonian , the sj state is the highest weight state associated with the mode decomposition of a non - local linear operator : @xmath4 where the kernel @xmath5 is the pauli - jordan function , _",
    "i.e. _ , a causal distributional solution to the classical klein - gordon equation .",
    "the sj vacuum is defined in such a way that upon quantization , the relation @xmath6|sj \\rangle$ ] holds .",
    "the domain of integration @xmath7 is a causal set , which we will take to be a causal diamond . in usual",
    "fock space constructions , the pauli - jordan function is a c - number operator , set by classical dynamics : it is a green s function for the klein - gordon equation which vanishes outside the causal cone .",
    "the sj proposal promotes this lack of ambiguity of the pauli - jordan function to a guiding principle behind the definition of `` positive '' and `` negative '' frequencies .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that , for any finite region @xmath7 , the operator @xmath8 is self - adjoint .",
    "one can then obtain eigenmodes @xmath9 such that : @xmath10 with this at hand one decomposes the spectrum into `` positive '' ( @xmath11 ) and `` negative '' ( @xmath12 ) frequency modes @xmath13 , and define the sj wightman function as : @xmath14 given that the operator is self - adjoint , one can also impose the reality condition on the eigenmodes @xmath15^*=t_k^+$ ] .    the sj wightman function @xmath16",
    "thus defined satisfies these three conditions @xcite :    * comutator : @xmath17 * positivity : @xmath18 * orthogonal supports : @xmath19    the first two conditions are satisfied by the two - point function of any state , while the third acts as the ground state condition which can be interpreted as the requirement that the wightman function will be the `` positive frequency part '' of the pauli - jordan function , thought as an ( c - number ) operator on the hilbert space of square integrable functions @xmath20 .",
    "the splitting of the hilbert space between positive and negative frequency solutions is the grassmannian structure at the core of any quantum field theory .",
    "the spirit of defining a quantum field theory from its correlation functions , rather than the fock space construction , was anticipated by the old axiomatic approach , found an explicit representation in the conformal bootstrap @xcite and has been incorporated into recent formulations of quantum field theory .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for a discussion on the advantages and difficulties .",
    "the construction thus defines a unique state @xmath3 if @xmath21 has a unique square root .",
    "this is supposed to hold as long as @xmath8 is self - adjoint and there are no zero modes .",
    "this condition holds for any bounded region of a globally hyperbolic four - dimensional spacetime @xcite , while for a bounded region in a two dimensional spacetime the integral operator @xmath8 is self - adjoint and hilbert - schmidt , with finite trace squared @xcite .",
    "we will specialize to a single massless scalar field in @xmath22 dimensions , and chose for @xmath7 a causal diamond defined by lightcone coordinates @xmath23 .",
    "the metric and the klein - gordon equation is simply : @xmath24 the pauli - jordan function in these coordinates is given by : @xmath25\\ ] ] such that eigenfunctions for positive eigenvalues of the integral operator split into two families @xcite : @xmath26 with eigenvalues @xmath27 real .",
    "the sum of the squared eigenvalues is finite ( @xmath28 ) , as befitting to an operator of the hilbert - schmidt class .",
    "summing over the two sets of modes , one finds from the wightman function : @xmath29-\\log\\left[1-e^{-\\frac{i\\pi(v - v')}{2\\ell}}\\right ] + \\log\\left[1+e^{-\\frac{i\\pi(u - v')}{2\\ell } }   \\right ] \\\\ & + \\log\\left[1+e^{-\\frac{i\\pi(v - u')}{2\\ell } }   \\right ]   \\big\\}+\\epsilon(u , v;u',v').\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath30 term is a `` correction term '' , stemming from the fact that the values of @xmath31 are approximately given by odd multiples of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , for sufficiently large @xmath34 : @xmath35 }   -\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{g^0_n(u , v)(g^0_n)^*(u',v')}{4\\pi(2n-1 ) } , \\label{eq : correction - term}\\ ] ] with @xmath36+\\exp[-(2k-1)\\pi    i\\frac{v}{2\\ell}]$ ] is the limit of @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "this term contributes comparatively little for the sj function , but will contribute to the stress - energy tensor .",
    "it does have a well - defined coincidence limit @xmath39 and hence it can be studied independently of the divergent part .",
    "if we disregard the correction term , the expression for the sj wightman function becomes @xmath40 , \\label{sj - box}\\ ] ] exactly the expression for the two point function of a massless scalar field in a box with reflecting boundaries at @xmath41 in a conformal vacuum .    in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the sj wightman function approximates the usual minkowski expression , up to an additive constant , for values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 close to the center of the causal diamond . for values close to the corner",
    ", however , there is an interesting `` mirror behavior '' , where the reflecting boundaries become important .",
    "the consideration of this behavior , as well as a thorough numerical study of the correction term @xmath44 , is performed in @xcite .",
    "in the poincar vacuum , the expectation value for the stress tensor is infinite , and one usually deals with this by assuming normal ordering .",
    "physically , one could think of the normal ordering as imposing the constraint that the vacuum should have zero energy and momentum .",
    "when one considers gravity , however , the question of the vacuum energy is no longer so simple",
    ". the stress tensor sources gravity , and one has to resort to other means to be rid of the infinities .",
    "one such method is by adding a cosmological constant term @xcite , which sets some fiduciary , usually associated to the `` vacuum '' in curved space time , stress tensor @xmath45 , to zero .",
    "the physical stress tensor will then be : @xmath46 of course , once one could change the fiduciary metric or some other property of the spacetime , @xmath47 becomes observable .",
    "such effects would correspond , for instance , to the casimir effect or the dependence of the cosmological constant to some physical parameter .",
    "the procedure to define @xmath47 is as follows .",
    "one starts with the symmetric green s function , or the hadamard elementary function @xmath48 for a generic `` vacuum '' state @xmath49 , and takes the derivatives involved in computing the stress energy tensor before taking the coincidence limit : @xmath50 . \\label{tren}\\ ] ] in this way one bypasses the ambiguities involved in defining the product of local operators at coincident points , and take a symmetric view on the arguments . in our application ,",
    "the vacuum state is @xmath51 , and the differential operator @xmath52 will have the flat space expression .",
    "we will implement the renormalization by inspecting how changes with the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "because of scale invariance , this may mean changing the size of the causal diamond or changing the cosmological constant `` counterterm '' . we will delay the discussion about backreaction to the next section .    to compute with hadamard s elementary function associated with",
    ", we first check how the expression changes with @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath53 which can be split into the contributions coming from @xmath54 and the correction term , or @xmath55 .",
    "we can check that : @xmath56 with this expression , the limit @xmath57 diverges , but the derivative of the stress energy tensor is finite : @xmath58 thus the finite part of @xmath59 should be : @xmath60 it can be checked that @xmath61 has exactly the same value .",
    "the calculation is entirely similar , but with the roles of @xmath42 and @xmath43 interchanged .",
    "this non - zero value is nothing but the casimir energy associated with the fact that the sj wightman function @xmath54 behaves as if one has reflecting boundary conditions at @xmath41 .",
    "the coincident limit of the @xmath62 derivative tells us how the two - point function , and hence the effective action @xmath63 depend on a scale transformation @xmath64 , @xmath65 . by general considerations @xcite",
    "this is the expectation value of the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the coincident limit of the @xmath62 derivative of the hadamard function is : @xmath66 we note that it depends explicitly on the coordinates .",
    "again , this should not be a surprise given that the choice of the causal diamond explictly breaks poincar invariance .",
    "it diverges at the positions of the `` mirrors '' @xmath41 , a fact we will turn back to in the next section .    the @xmath30 term has a finite coincidence limit and its contribution to the @xmath67 and @xmath68 component of the stress - energy tensor can be readily calculated : @xmath69= \\frac{\\sigma\\pi}{96\\ell^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the n - th root of @xmath71 .",
    "a numerical estimate gives @xmath72 .",
    "one sees that its effect counters the contribution of the casimir energy from @xmath73 , even though the correction term is small and slowing changing over the causal diamond @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this apparent contradiction is that the fraction term in the sum above , coming from the @xmath74 norm of the eigenmodes @xmath75 enhances the energy for small @xmath76 , making it larger than the box contribution .",
    "we will call the total contribution a casimir energy .",
    "the trace correction due to the epsilon term is also expressed as a sum over the roots of @xmath71 : @xmath77 .",
    "\\label{eq : tracebox}\\ ] ] using that @xmath78 , the sum can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms .",
    "let us consider the first two terms of the summand : @xmath79 the potencially dangerous first term gives a sum of delta functions : @xmath80,\\ ] ] whose contribution for states constructed from @xmath3 with smooth test functions is zero .",
    "the next order term can be readily computed from the mode sum , using the taylor expansion of @xmath81 : @xmath82 which also depends on the coordinates .",
    "this term also diverges for @xmath41 , albeit logarithmically , even though the correction term is supposed to be small .",
    "terms of higher order will also display this behavior . using the identities :",
    "@xmath83 one can write the generic term as a polynomial times the combination of polylogarithms @xmath84 .",
    "the singular behavior of the trace stems from the expansion of the polylogarithm near @xmath85 @xcite : @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 analytic at @xmath85 .",
    "one should expect an logarithm divergence at @xmath41 for all terms in the expansion , and then the contribution of the correction term to the trace will be subdominant with respect to .",
    "its effect to will be felt near the divergent points @xmath41 by changin the @xmath89 term in front to a generic polynomial on @xmath90 .",
    "we will disregard the contribution of these subdominant terms from now on .    with this provision ,",
    "let us now sum the different contributions . in terms of coordinates",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 is given by : @xmath94 the off - diagonal term @xmath95 is zero .",
    "the result can be written in the form : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the minkowski metric and @xmath98 a constant time - like vector .",
    "the result displays not only the casimir energy , but also the contribution from the trace anomaly .",
    "its effect , even for small values of @xmath92 , overwhelms completely the casimir term .",
    "the divergence means that we can no longer disregard the coupling to gravity , at least for finite @xmath0 .",
    "as we take @xmath99 , the contribution vanishes as one should expect from the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the result shows that the expectation value for the stress energy in the sj state diverges for finite @xmath0 at the positions @xmath41 .",
    "this divergence comes from the non - zero value for the expectation value of the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "classically , the trace should vanish because of the scale invariance of the massless scalar field in two dimensions .",
    "the choice of sj state breaks this scale invariance , and thus we should have a coupling between the expectation value of the field and the metric .",
    "in other words , we should have induced gravity .    in order to find this metric ,",
    "let us recall that diffeomorphism invariance requires that the stress - energy tensor should be conserved @xmath100 .",
    "but as we can see with a direct calculation : @xmath101 with the flat metric expression . the way around it is to impose the constraint that , in the induced metric @xmath102 we will have conservation , with @xmath103 the covariant derivative associated with @xmath102 .",
    "any two dimensional metric is conformally flat , so we can write the ansatz for @xmath102 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the liouville field , and will set the induced scale . with @xmath106 as in , the following equation ensues from @xmath100 : @xmath107 the first equation above states that @xmath108 does nt depend on @xmath91 as expected , while the second can be readily integrated to : @xmath109 one should note that the @xmath99 limit is taken by a scaling procedure , where the line element @xmath110 goes to the proper minkowskian limit when one takes the size of the box to infinity .",
    "the riemann scalar @xmath111 is a complicated function of @xmath92 , but it asymptotes a constant curvature for @xmath41 : @xmath112 one can see that the induced metric is the consistency condition for the two dimensional trace anomaly @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath114 for the massless scalar field .",
    "the geometry of the induced metric is asymptotically that of two dimensional anti - de sitter space ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the patch of the causal diamond covers a part of @xmath115 , see fig .",
    "1 . the geometry has a conformal boundary at @xmath116 , which is spatial infinity . because of the nature of spatial infinity ,",
    "lightrays take a finite time , as counted by the observer sitting at @xmath117 to reach it .",
    "placing reflecting boundary conditions is natural from a broad perspective , since it allows for an unitary bulk and boundary dynamics @xcite . it is not by any means the unique choice @xcite .",
    "the mirror behavior found in @xcite is at any rate deeply tied with the induced metric .",
    "it would not be compatible with any other type of asymptotic geometry .",
    "and a light ray takes a finite interval of @xmath91 to cross from one boundary to the other.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : ads2 ]",
    "in this letter we conducted a study of the stress tensor renormalization for the sorkin - johnston state of a massless scalar field in two dimensions associated with a causal diamond .",
    "we have found that for the purposes of renormalization of the stress - tensor energy one can no longer disregard the correction function arising from finite size effect to the wave number of the modes .",
    "the correction function counteracts the casimir term , reducing severely its strength .",
    "moreover , one also finds a trace anomaly term , which diverges at the spatial coordinates at the tip of the causal diamond .",
    "subsequent backreaction shows that the induced metric is that of a asymptotically anti - de sitter space with a conformal boundary sitting at the tip of the causal diamond .",
    "this provides another view on the mirror behavior found previously , corresponding to reflective boundary conditions for the field in spacial infinity of ads space .    from this study",
    "one should expect a completely different behavior for non - zero mass fields : in this case , even classically , the trace is not expected to be zero , the value is proportional to the mass .",
    "it is not reasonable then to expect the same kind of mirror behavior , as renormalization effects can be absorbed by a mass redefinition .",
    "also , questions have been raised about the stability of the linear perturbations in anti - de sitter space with respect to backreaction ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "translated to the sj construction , these could mean instability of the sj state itself .",
    "perhaps this is the reason behind the large contribution of the correction - term , dominating over the `` box '' casimir energy .",
    "this should have implications even to the original purpose of defining the sj state as a `` vacuum '' which is associated with finite - time measurements .    in two dimensions ,",
    "many problematic aspects of the sj state do not appear , which actually makes the whole treatment of this letter possible .",
    "for instance , the treatment in section [ sec : trenorm ] guarantees that the sj state considered here satisfies the hadamard condition . for more generic settings , like the addition of a mass term",
    ", one may not be so lucky . at any rate",
    ", the coupling of massive fields will also have a crucial contribution from the correction term , but the analysis can be forced to include the modification term proposed by @xcite .",
    "the renormalized stress tensor will surely play a big impact on the understanding of the thermodynamics of the causal diamond , along with the entanglement entropy .",
    "we hope to address these points in future work .",
    "we would like to thank amlcar queiroz and fbio novaes for comments and suggestions .",
