    "the large @xmath0 limit constitutes a well - defined and systematic theoretical framework to address fundamental questions of qcd thooft , witten , reviewnc .",
    "recently , basic properties of the qcd phase diagram for @xmath3 have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and further investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein .    in this work",
    "we address the following question : does nuclear matter bind for @xmath4 it is interesting to investigate whether the existence of nuclear matter is a special phenomenon of @xmath1 or it is a general feature independent on the number of colors .",
    "it is not possible to answer this question by using qcd .",
    "in fact , the latter is not solvable , not even in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "thus , the only way to study nuclear matter at large @xmath0 is to use an effective lagrangian .",
    "the most convenient choice for this purpose is the walecka model @xcite , which has been widely used for studies at nonzero density .",
    "in fact , although this model is naive , we use it for several reasons : ( i ) regardless of the real model describing nature , nuclear matter saturation can be always described by using an effective walecka - like model including attractive scalar interactions and repulsive vector interactions .",
    "this means that the ( unfortunately unknown ) correct chiral model for low - energy hadrons must reduce , for densities close to nuclear matter and for small temperature , to a walecka - like model .",
    "( ii ) although the lagrangian does not embed important symmetries of qcd such as chiral symmetry and scale invariance , we are limiting our study to nuclear matter .",
    "this is a regime of baryon densities at which these symmetries are strongly broken .",
    "( iii ) the walecka model has the advantage of being simple , allowing a direct understanding of the large @xmath5 behavior of nuclear matter .    for @xmath1 the couplings",
    "are fixed to recover the usual nuclear density properties : saturation at @xmath6 @xmath7 and an energy per nucleon @xmath8 mev .",
    "we then rescale the couplings with appropriate powers of @xmath0 and perform the study at higher @xmath0 values : in this way it is possible to check if nuclear matter still exists when increasing @xmath9    we shall find that the binding of nuclear matter at large @xmath0 strongly depends on the nature of the lightest scalar resonance(s ) amslerrev , dynrec . in the ( old - fashioned ) assignment",
    "in which the lightest scalar resonance @xmath10 is predominantly a quark - antiquark state , nuclear matter binds indeed at each @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the binding energy increases for increasing @xmath0 .    however , the quark - antiquark scenario is regarded as unfavored by most recent works on the low - energy scalar sector dynrec , pelaeznc , pennington , denis .",
    "we thus study alternative assignments for the scalar resonances , which are in agreement with the phenomenology .",

    "bind for @xmath13 and indeed ceases to exist already for @xmath14    we also repeat our analysis for other assignments in the scalar sector : ( i ) even if the light scalar states are predominantly tetraquarks , scalar quarkonium states must exist .",
    "for this reason we study an enlarged scenario in which , besides the resonance @xmath10 interpreted as predominantly tetraquark , a second scalar field , identified with the resonance @xmath15 , is added and interpreted as predominantly quarkonium .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the outcome of ref .",
    "@xcite , where two scalar fields with similar masses are needed in order to describe nucleon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "( ii ) the role of two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) processes can be important for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "we thus test the scenario in which a scalar field describes effectively the tpe attraction in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "( iii ) the assignment in which the lightest scalar state @xmath10 is interpreted as a glueball is investigated .",
    "( iv ) the lightest scalar resonance @xmath10 can be also regarded as a ` dynamically generated resonance ' emerging from pion - pion interactions @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that also in all these cases nuclear matter does _ not _",
    "bind for in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the non existence of nuclear matter for large @xmath0 is thus not an artifact of a particular assignment for the light scalar states , but is a stable result as soon as the quarkonium interpretation is abandoned .",
    "note also that , while studies of nucleon - nucleon potentials in the large @xmath0 limit exist manohar , arriola , the different scaling properties for @xmath16 due to the non - quarkonium nature of the scalar attraction have not yet been ( to our knowledge ) systemically investigated .",

    "@xcite , it is found that the quark - antiquark scalar state @xmath33 corresponds to the resonance @xmath34 rather than to the resonance @xmath35 . nevertheless , due to its historical importance and the well - defined large @xmath0 behavior",

    "the reason for this property is easy to understand : since in this case @xmath19 and @xmath21 are both @xmath42 states , their couplings scale in the same way . therefore , the balance between attraction and repulsion among nucleons , leading to saturation , does not depend on the number of colors . as a consequence of the scaling , the value of the saturation density , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rho ] , reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath43 when @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",

    "we reach a domain of temperatures in which our present mean - field and walecka - based study should be regarded with care .",
    "moreover , for @xmath0 large enough , the critical temperature would also overshoot the deconfinement temperature @xmath46 which is a @xmath0-independent quantity .",
    "it is anyhow interesting to observe that in this scenario the nuclear - liquid transition line becomes longer on the @xmath47-direction , see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a van der waals approach to describe the nuclear - liquid phase transition is used .",
    "the results presented in this subsection lead  at first sight  to a strongly bound nuclear matter for large @xmath9 however , even in the quark - antiquark scenario for the light @xmath21 meson , the next - to - leading order corrections to the @xmath21 mass are non - negligible .",
    "namely , the function @xmath48 can be rewritten as@xmath49 this formula takes into account the fact that the mass for @xmath50 @xmath51 is reduced by meson loops with respect to the large @xmath0 asymptotic value @xmath52 @xcite . in the case of the light @xmath35",
    "meson this mass reduction is generated by the pion loops and is large , as the large width of this resonance confirms .",
    "numerically , one has @xmath53-@xmath54 mev@xmath55 which implies a meson - loop mass reduction of about 100 - 250 mev .",

    "this fact was already recognized in the original works by t hooft @xcite and witten @xcite : instead of a tetraquark one has in the large @xmath0 limit two ` standard ' quark - antiquark mesons .",

    "considering that our tetraquark for @xmath1 consists of two good diquarks , it should be asked what is a good diquark for @xmath37 .",
    "the answer is simple : a ` good diquark ' for @xmath37 is an object with @xmath61 quarks in a antisymmetric color wave function : @xmath62 this means that the generalization of a ` tetraquark ' for @xmath37 is a bound state of a @xmath63-quark object and a @xmath63-antiquark object @xcite : @xmath64 in this way also the ` tetraquark ' has a well - defined limit for @xmath65 whose mass scales as @xmath66 the interaction of the generalized tetraquark @xmath67 with mesons and with nucleons is different :    \\(i ) the formation of two quark - antiquark mesons requires the annihilations of @xmath68 quark - antiquark pairs . for this reason the amplitude for the process @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents a quark - antiquark state , is given by @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the annihilation probability of a quark from @xmath74 and an antiquark from @xmath75 the full decay width of the process @xmath76 as a function of @xmath0 reads : @xmath77^{2}\\sim\\frac{1}{n_{c}% } e^{-n_{c}}\\text { . }",

    "the reason is that the attraction in the @xmath167 channel is mediated by meson exchange ( such as the exchange of a @xmath168 meson ) , whose corresponding scattering amplitudes scale as @xmath169 for @xmath0 large enough the interaction strength fades out and the light scalar resonance ceases to exist .",
    "thus , even its effect for nuclear matter does not take place : no binding at large @xmath0 takes place in scenarios in which @xmath10 is dynamically generated . *",
    "the previous conclusion holds also when the light resonance @xmath170 emerges as a low - energy companion pole @xcite .",
    "in fact , these new poles disappear for @xmath16 .",
    "in this work we studied the formation of nuclear matter for @xmath171 we conclude that the present phenomenological information about scalar mesons implies that no nuclear matter exists for large @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the only case in which nuclear matter does not disappear by increasing @xmath0 is the naive quarkonium assignment for the lightest scalar resonance .",
    "this scenario is criticized by many recent and less recent studies of low - energy hadron phenomenology , which agree that the light scalar states below 1 gev are not predominantly quarkonium states . moreover , even in the quarkonium picture one should at least include the effects of the pion - pion dressing , which is expected to be large in view of the broad nature of the resonance .",
    "this property is enough to ` unbind ' nuclear matter for large @xmath9    the non existence of nuclear matter for large @xmath0 has been explicitly shown in alternative scenarios for the light scalar states .",
    "we first concentrated on the tetraquark interpretation , in which a peculiar large @xmath5 limit has been discussed .",
    "we then studied the cases in which the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the scalar channel is dominated by : ( i ) two scalar fields , ( ii ) tpe processes , ( iii ) a glueball state , and ( iv ) a pion - pion molecular state .",
    "the common feature of all these assignments is that nuclear matter does not bind for large @xmath9 numerically , the value @xmath172 is already enough to render nuclear matter unstable .",
    "the results of this work have been derived by using walecka - type models .",
    "we have limited the study to nuclear matter density and small temperatures , where the walecka model represents a well - defined and useful theoretical tool . moreover ,",
    "the main goal of the present work is not a precise numerical study of nuclear matter properties , but simply to assess its existence for @xmath173 : for this reason a simple and schematic model as the walecka one fulfills the desired requirements .",
    "however , it is surely an interesting task for the future to repeat the present study going beyond the mean field approximations used here",
    ".    obviously we do live in a world in which nuclear matter exists .",
    "the laws of nature must allow for nuclear matter , so that life as we know it might evolve ( anthropic principle ) .",
    "the subtle point is not ( only ) the existence of nuclear matter , but the fact that the binding energy per nucleon @xmath174 mev is much smaller than the natural scale of the system , @xmath175 mev .",
    "our outcome that nuclear matter exists only for @xmath176 and is thus a peculiar property of our world , is in agreement with the phenomenological realized smallness of the ratio @xmath177 .",
    "in fact , in the tetraquark ( or molecular ) scenario , the decreasing of @xmath0 favors the formation of nuclear matter . by decreasing @xmath0 from @xmath2 to @xmath178 an increase of the binding energy",
    "is obtained . in the framework of nuclear matter , @xmath1 is not large at all .",
    "it should be stressed that all this is not true when the lightest scalar state is a quarkonium state , for which the relation @xmath179 holds . in this ( unfavored ) scenario",
    "the smallness of the binding energy could not be understood .",
    "note that , while it is clearly not possible to investigate experimentally the ( non)binding of nuclear matter for @xmath180 this can be the subject of computer simulations of qcd , in which the number of colors is a parameter which can be easily changed .",
    "many studies have already shown that the conditions for the existence of complex life represent a small volume in the space of the free parameters ( coupling constants and masses ) of the standard model ( e.g.  @xcite and refs .  therein ) .",
    "the present study shows that these conditions are restricted also in the direction of @xmath9 the change of @xmath0 can be regarded as a change of the group structure of the standard model .",
    "the fact that the group of the strong interaction in our universe is @xmath181 with @xmath182 should not be a surprise .",
