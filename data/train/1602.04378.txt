    "the @xmath0 meson is a particularly interesting hadron for a variety of reasons .",
    "it is a non - strange particle composed of a @xmath5 pair of quarks , and is characterized by the narrow mass distribution centered at @xmath6  gev/@xmath7 , and decay width @xmath8  mev  @xcite .",
    "its suppressed decay modes have accompanied the discovery of the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of its production in the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion ( aa ) collisions has been interpreted as the result of fragmentation of gluons into q@xmath9 pairs in the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "calculations in the frame of the transport buu code suggest that @xmath0 mesons from the heavy - ion collisions at energies below threshold in a free nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collision may be produced on average even earlier than kaons , and due to relatively weak absorption and rescattering cross sections , a majority of @xmath0 s may survive the collision . therefore , @xmath0 mesons may be a good probe of earlier stages of the heavy - ion collision  @xcite .    in the proton - proton ( pp ) collisions , the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath10",
    "cross sections obtained near @xmath0 meson threshold was found to violate the ozi rule by about an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "studies of near - threshold @xmath0 meson production in pa collisions revealed the target mass dependence of a@xmath11  @xcite , and pointed to the momentum - dependent widening of the @xmath0 width in the nuclear medium , from where the @xmath0n absorption cross section of about 1520  mb was estimated  @xcite .    in the domain of heavy - ion collisions data on",
    "the subthreshold @xmath0 meson production is quite scarce . in the first measurement",
    "only @xmath12 events were found in the k@xmath13k@xmath14 channel and the reconstructed yield per event varied by the depending on the value of temperature parameter of the @xmath0 meson source assumed for the efficiency evaluation  @xcite .",
    "recently , three samples of about @xmath0 mesons were measured at quite similar values of the average number of participant nucleons ( @xmath15 = ) , and beam kinetic energies in the range of 1.751.9a gev  @xcite .",
    "production yields per triggered event were found to be @xmath16 .",
    "taking into account that the branching ratio equals @xmath17 ) = 48.9 %  @xcite , and comparing to the corresponding production yields of k@xmath14 , it was inferred that @xmath0 mesons were the source of about of negatively charged kaons .",
    "a determination of the size of this contribution , and tracing its dependency on the beam energy and collision centrality is important in the context of the investigation of in - medium modifications of k@xmath14 mesons from their emission patterns  @xcite . as the mean decay path of @xmath0 meson is 46  fm , it decays mostly outside the collision zone , and therefore the majority of daughter kaons are not produced in the medium .",
    "phase space distribution of negative kaons is thus composed of two contributions , and the extraction procedure of the kaon potential inside the medium should take into account the side feeding from @xmath0 meson decays .    in recent years",
    "there has been a considerable development on the side of transport models .",
    "earlier calculations in the frame of the buu code performed for the collisions of central ni+ni at 1.93a gev , and ru+ru at 1.69a gev favored the dominance of meson - baryon production channels ( @xmath18 , m = [ @xmath19 ,  @xmath20 , b = [ n ,  @xmath21 )  @xcite . however , further buu calculations employing the new effective parameterization of the @xmath22 channels ( n = [ p , n ] ) , performed for the central ni ( 1.93a gev ) + ni and semi - central ar ( 1.756a gev ) + kcl collisions suggested the bb production channels to be of equal strength as mb",
    ". an interesting study of @xmath0 meson production in ca ( 1.76a gev ) + ca collisions in the frame of the urqmd model has been recently published  @xcite . within this approach",
    "the decays of massive resonances [ @xmath23 have been pointed out as a dominant source of @xmath0 mesons ( cf .",
    "therein ) . in both types of calculations",
    "the ratio was predicted to be similar to the experimental findings in the ar+kcl and ni+ni systems .",
    "the buu model gave detailed predictions on the composition of production channels as a function of impact parameter , distribution of production times and kinematic variables , while the urqmd calculations predicted a specific profile of the excitation function of ratio with a maximum around the threshold energy , evolving around the ags beam energy region into the constant , lower value .",
    "thermal models also deliver predictions of the @xmath0 meson production yields in an event . in ref .",
    "@xcite the ratio is predicted to be centrality independent , and correlated only with the temperature of the system .",
    "calculations of the ratio shown in fig .  13 of ref .",
    "@xcite predict the strong enhancement around the threshold , sensitive to the suppression of the volume in which the open strangeness is produced ( @xmath24 parameter ) .",
    "however , there seems to be a strong disparity between the variety of predictions of subthreshold @xmath0 meson production and the scarcity of available experimental data .    in our work",
    "we address this gap by analysing @xmath0 mesons produced in the central ni+ni collisions at the beam kinetic energy of 1.93a gev , and decaying in the dominant k@xmath13k@xmath14 channel .",
    "while , as mentioned above , these mesons were already investigated within the similar centrality class , a relatively low number of @xmath25 acquired events in the experiment reported in  @xcite resulted in only @xmath12 events attributed to @xmath0 mesons . in the experiment described in this paper ,",
    "about 17 times more events were acquired for the central trigger ( defined in sect .",
    "[ sect : exp ] ) , giving a good chance to measure @xmath0 mesons at considerably better significance level .    as data on @xmath0 meson production at 1.9a gev",
    "was also published for the less central ni+ni collisions , as well as central al+al collisions , our investigation allows for the first time to gain insight into the centrality dependence of the subthreshold @xmath0 meson production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the s261 experiment was performed at the sis18 synchrotron in the gsi , darmstadt .",
    "@xmath26ni ions were accelerated to the kinetic energy of 1.93a gev , and were incident on the @xmath26ni target of the fopi modular spectrometer with the average intensity of @xmath27 ions per spill .",
    "the target had thickness of 360 mg/@xmath28 corresponding to 1.0% interaction probability .",
    "the innermost detector of the fopi setup is the central drift chamber ( cdc ) covering the wide range of polar angles ( @xmath29 , ) , and subdivided azimuthally into 16 identical sectors .",
    "the cdc was surrounded by the time - of - flight ( tof ) detector named plastic scintillation barrel ( psb ) , which covered the polar angles of @xmath30 .",
    "both detectors were mounted inside the magnet solenoid , which generated the field of 0.6  t. the plastic scintillation wall ( plawa ) was placed downstream of the cdc .",
    "more information on the geometry and performance of the fopi apparatus can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the on - line `` central '' trigger was based on the large number of hits in the plawa .",
    "after an additional off - line removal of events with vertex position outside the target , about @xmath31 events were selected , amounting to @xmath32% of the total reaction cross - section . assuming the sharp cut - off approximation between the total reaction cross section and maximum impact parameter , and the geometrical model of interpenetrating spheres , the number of participant nucleons averaged over the impact parameter was estimated to be @xmath33 .",
    "charged particles passing through the cdc detector activate the nearest sense wires , represented within the data acquisition scheme as `` hits '' .",
    "an off - line tracking routine collects them into `` tracks '' , and reconstructs the emission angles and specific energy loss of particles . for these particles which additionally generate hits in the psb detector ,",
    "the tof information is also obtained .",
    "a reconstruction of the collision vertex allows for the elimination of events not originating from the target .    to preselect the tracks with good reconstruction quality",
    ", these composed of few hits were rejected .",
    "the tracks with too large distance of closest approach to the vertex were also eliminated .",
    "the candidates for k@xmath13 and k@xmath14 mesons were searched from the tracks matched with hits in the tof barrel . for a good quality of matching , the extrapolation of the cdc track was required to pass close to the hit candidate in the psb detector . to minimize the edge effects , the range of accepted polar angles",
    "was trimmed down to @xmath34 , and k@xmath13 ( k@xmath14 ) candidates were required to have the transverse momentum @xmath35 of at least 0.18 ( 0.14 ) gev/@xmath36 .",

    "the @xmath0 mesons in the k@xmath13k@xmath14 decay channel were investigated in the invariant mass ( @xmath40 ) distribution of kaon pairs . as the resolutions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 distributions in fopi are well known to deteriorate with momentum , to limit the influence of particles with neighbouring masses ( pions and protons ) , the maximum momentum was set to 0.65  gev/@xmath36 . in the fopi analyses aiming at the selection of k@xmath13 and/or k@xmath14 using psb , a reasonable level of signal to background ( s / b ) ratio was usually kept if particles were limited to lower maximum momenta : about 0.55  gev/@xmath36 for k@xmath13 , and 0.38  gev/@xmath36 for k@xmath14  @xcite . however , for the @xmath0 meson reconstruction analysis an unambiguous selection of kaons is not so critical , as some admixture of misidentified particles is not expected to create a correlation around @xmath41 . to minimize possible distortions arising for the kaon pair candidates with small relative angles , pairs were required not to intersect in the active region of the cdc .",

    "distributions of the quality parameters for the experimental and simulated tracks were found to mostly overlap . to account for minor discrepancies ,",
    "the cut values for the simulated tracks were tuned such that a given cut filtered out the same fraction of tracks in the generated sample , and in the true ( measured ) one .",

    "it was also found that the efficiency obtained with @xmath59 was only 2% lower , while variations due to different assumed values of @xmath51 remained within @xmath60 range .    in the next step",
    "we have checked whether the simulation reproduced the efficiency of matching of tracks in the cdc with hits in the psb .",
    "as the statistics on kaons was too low for a reliable study of this issue , the effect for negatively charged particles was tested on @xmath61 tracks , and that for positively charged ones  on the sum of @xmath62 and protons . in the first step",
    "the ratio of cdc tracks with associated hit in the psb to all the reconstructed cdc tracks was inspected as a function of laboratory polar angle and transverse momentum .",
    "this ratio was obtained independently for the experimental and simulated data .",
    "subsequently , the ratio obtained for the experimental data was divided by that for the simulated data , to yield the correction factor for the matching efficiency ,    @xmath63    the meaning of this factor is : if the matching efficiency for a particle is worse ( better ) in the experiment than in the simulation , the factor is lower ( higher ) than 1 . the @xmath64 distribution of @xmath65 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bareff ] , shows that discrepancies between the simulated and experimental matching efficiencies remain mostly within a @xmath66 range .",

    "since none of the parameter combinations resulted in a significantly different value of the @xmath0 meson yield , the latter has been determined by averaging the contributions from these combinations , as detailed in eq .",
    "[ eq : yield_phi ] .",
    "this approach also allowed to choose the confidence level ( cl ) at which the systematic errors were to be extracted . in this work we took the range containing 68.3% of the abovementioned contributions , summed up around the mean value of the yield .      for the analysis of the centrality dependence of the multiplicity of @xmath0 mesons at 1.9a gev",
    ", we include the data from semi - central ni+ni collisions presented in  @xcite and from central collisions of al+al  @xcite .",
    "we have reanalysed the centrality determination procedure for the data published in  @xcite , and got a slightly corrected value of the cross section obtained with the used trigger : @xmath67% of the total reaction cross section . within the geometrical model of interpenetrating spheres",
    "this translates into the average number of participants of @xmath68 .",
    "in order to stay consistent with the method used to determine the yield value and systematic errors described in sect .  [ sect : detasysterr ] , the data from  @xcite and  @xcite had to be adjusted .",
    "for the ni+ni analysis reported in  @xcite , the `` cl = 68.3% '' systematic error was obtained by reanalysing the distribution of possible values of the @xmath0 meson multiplicity per event resulting from various combinations of the applied cuts . in case of the al+al analysis presented in @xcite ,",
    "we have shifted the value of yield slightly to remove the asymmetry of systematic errors .",
    "in addition , as the systematic errors for the latter analysis corresponded to range , we took the published value of this error divided by two as an upper estimation of the value .      to study the centrality dependence of the ratio we used the published values from  @xcite and  @xcite and applied slight corrections according to the prescriptions specified above in the appendix  [ sect : detacen ] . to reconstruct the centrality dependence of the ratio , for two samples of ni+ni data we interpolated the data points from the @xmath70 dependence of the @xmath62 yield per event , reported in fig .  1 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in case of the al+al collisions , the @xmath62 yield is not yet known . as an estimation of this yield we took the yield of positive pions from ni+ni at the same number of participant nucleons as for the al+al experiment .",
    "we motivate this substitution by three arguments :    * at beam energies of 1 and 1.5a gev the pion yield _ per number of participant nucleons _ as function of @xmath70 was found to be parameterized by one ( universal ) curve for a wide range of system sizes , as shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    ".  @xcite . *",
    "the n / z ratios for al+al and ni+ni systems are the same , * the pion yield per @xmath70 for the collisions of the moderate - size ni+ni system at 1a gev was found to be 15% higher than that for the collisions of large au+au system ( see p.  480 in ref .",
    "if we assume that the further drop of the system size from ni+ni to al+al generates the same rise of the pion yield per @xmath70 , it introduces a change of the value of the fitted @xmath71 exponent from 1.0 to 1.1 , which is minor compared to the fit error associated to this parameter .",
