    "in particular the global analysis of the parton densities requires many arbitrary free parameters . in spite of the fact that these densities allow us to describe many hard processes their arbitrariness impairs the predictive power of perturbative qcd .",

    "<S> exploration of the small @xmath0 kinematic region by the hera experiments led to a revival of some models which existed before the advent of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of the strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of these models for the deep inelastic structure functions are compared with those given by qcd . </S>",
    "<S> future experiments will concentrate on the large @xmath0-region and we will discuss some issues which are important for the test of qcd . in particular we emphasize the next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) order analysis of the structure functions and the determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also make some critical remarks about the relevance of so called large corrections in the small and large @xmath0-region . </S>"
