    "_ broken symmetry states can occur at integer filling factors when interactions dominate the energetic splitting of nearby landau levels . _",
    "the width of the ordered region tends to expand when the single - particle field parameters are small and all four single - particle landau levels are close to degeneracy .",
    "the intersection of this phase diagram with the @xmath7 plane recovers the results obtained originally by das sarma _ et al . _ and derived analytically in section iv . in the ordered region within the @xmath7 plane , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 while @xmath207 .",
    "when @xmath208 , interlayer phase coherence is not spontaneous so @xmath206 represents only the @xmath73-axis spin - rotation ( u(1 ) ) broken symmetry . in the ordered portion of the @xmath175 plane and for @xmath209 , @xmath210 , but @xmath188 .",
    "the order here involves spontaneous interlayer phase coherence and spin order ; as at @xmath14 we can expect interesting physics to occur for small @xmath3 in tilted fields in this region of the phase diagram .",
    "the ordered state has @xmath73-axis spin - rotation and @xmath69-axis pseudospin - rotation broken symmetries ( u(1)@xmath211u(1 ) broken symmetry ) so we expect two distinct goldstone modes to appear . at @xmath6",
    "the broken symmetry changes to su(2)@xmath211u(1 ) in the ordered region of @xmath5 plane .",
    "the phase diagram intersections with the @xmath6 and @xmath5 planes are in agreement with the analytic results presented in sections iii and v respectively . in the ordered region of the @xmath6 plane ,",
    "both @xmath106 and @xmath109 are non - zero and are indices of the same broken symmetry . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian is spin - rotationally invariant so we have a su(2 ) broken symmetry .    in experimental samples ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath3 can easily be made large but @xmath2 is usually small .",
    "since it is easy to tune the bias voltage @xmath1 over large ranges experimentally , we examine below the dependence of physical observables on this parameter with the other two parameters held fixed .    in figs .",

    "results are plotted here for @xmath215 , ( 0.02,0.02 ) , and ( 0.1,0.02 ) .",
    "these choices are motivated by the fact that it is difficult to fabricate samples with values of the zeeman coupling in interaction units @xmath98 which differ from 0.02 by more than a factor of two at @xmath0 , while it is relatively easy to vary @xmath3 from a large value to one which is immeasurably small , by changing the aluminum content in the barrier separating the quantum wells .",

    "[ numerical](a ) , confirm analytical results of section v : the order parameter @xmath188 while @xmath109 is non - zero for @xmath217 and @xmath218 ; the quasiparticle excitation gap @xmath212 is constant in the ordered region ; the charge is equally distributed between layers in the low @xmath1 disordered region , all electrons are in the top layer in the high @xmath1 disordered region and the charge is transferred between wells linearly with @xmath1 in the ordered region . in fig .",
    "[ numerical](b ) we show numerical results for @xmath219 .",
    "both low and high @xmath1 disordered regions are still present for this choice of external fields .",

    "[ numerical](c ) corresponds to large enough tunneling energy ( @xmath220 ) so that the @xmath7 point falls into the ordered region of the zero - bias plane of the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ dtdz ] ) .",
    "hence , only the high @xmath1 phase boundary is present and is shifted further to lower @xmath1 , qualitatively consistent with our previous analysis of the @xmath80 phase plane .",
    "the variational ansatz ( [ generalwf ] ) on which we have based the analytic portion our analysis carries only 3 parameters .",
    "one might wonder if more general wavefunctions with more parameters could unearth lower energy states .",
    "let us consider how many parameters at most can be involved in the most general translationally invariant lll state of bilayer electrons with spin , at a filling @xmath221 .",
    "such a state will correspond , at each spatial point or lll orbital , to some 2-fermion state where each fermion is described by a 4-spinor .",
    "more generally , consider n fermions , each a d - spinor .",
    "there are @xmath222 combinations for placing n fermions in d states .",
    "each such combination corresponds to an independent n - fermion state .",
    "these form a basis and a general state will be a linear combination of these with complex coefficients .",
    "since each complex coefficient carries two real parameters the total number of parameters in the most general state will be @xmath223 ,   where 2 parameters have been subtracted out which respectively account for normalisation and an overall phase . for our problem",
    "where d=4 and n=2 , @xmath224 ; much larger than the number ( three ) of parameters in our trial spinors .",
    "however not all these @xmath225 independent states can be written as a single outer product of two 4-spinors , as is required for the slater determinant form ( [ hfstate ] ) of the hartree - fock trial states .",
    "for example , the linear combination of 2-electron states @xmath226 for any values of the constants @xmath227 which would need to satisfy the conflicting conditions @xmath228 , while @xmath229 . whether such variational states which , for each spatial point , are of products of spinors ( as for instance in ( [ funny ] ) ) can be candidates for the ground state of different phases is an interesting question .",
    "@xmath230 they are not ruled out by any basic superselection rules .",
    "however , broken symmetry states with which we are familiar , for example superconducting and magnetic states , can be described using an order parameter field functional integral language in which a saddle point approximation to the order parameter functional integral corresponds to a hartree - fock approximation for the broken symmetry ground state .",
    "we assume that to be the case for double - layer quantum hall states as well@xcite .",
    "in particular , we believe that the set of possible broken symmetries can be identified by looking only at single slater determinant states . the positions of the phase boundaries will be altered by quantum and , at finite temperature , also thermal fluctuations in the order parameter field . we therefore are motivated to identify the number of parameters needed to characterize all possible hartree - fock states",
    ".    a product of n orthonormal d - plets will carry nd complex parameters to start with .",
    "this will be reduced by @xmath10 normalization constraints , @xmath231 complex orthogonality constraints , and @xmath232 symmetry constraints since unitary transformations among the @xmath10 the single - particle states will not yield a distinct n - fermion state .",
    "this leaves behind @xmath233 real parameters .",
    "notice that this is just the dimensionality of the coset space @xmath234 .",
    "( see arovas et al @xcite who also do this counting ) . for @xmath235 and @xmath236 the number of free parameters in hartree - fock states is @xmath237 ; for @xmath238 , the case relevant to double - layer systems at @xmath14 , @xmath239 . for our problem ,",
    "the number of free parameters is further reduced by symmetries of the interaction hamiltonian which is invariant under arbitrary ( 3-parameter ) rotations in spin - space and under ( 1 more parameter ) rotations about the @xmath69 axis in pseudospin space . of course",
    "these symmetries are partially broken by one - body terms in the hamiltonian . however",
    ", such breaking simply selects a known preferred direction for the total spin - polarization ( along the zeeman coupling direction ) and for the projection of the total pseudospin polarization onto the @xmath240 plane ( the @xmath73 direction . )",
    "the end result is that the number of free parameters is @xmath241 for @xmath0 .",
    "we have used 3 parameters based on the assumption that in the grounds state pseudospin projections in _ each _ layer will be in the @xmath242 plane .",
    "the richness of order - disorder physics in double - layer quantum hall systems at @xmath0 suggests that this should be an inviting system for experiment . to date , only transport@xcite and optical@xcite studies , which probe the state rather indirectly have been completed .",
    "we believe that capacitance studies of double - layer systems as a function of an interlayer bias potential will prove more interesting .",
    "in particular we expect the differential capacitance , an experimentally accessible quantity which is the analog for these zero - temperature phase transitions of the specific heat in thermal phase transitions , to be a very useful probe in studying changes in singular dependence on bias potential with temperature , zeeman coupling strength , and interlayer tunneling amplitude .",
