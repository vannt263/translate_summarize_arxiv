    "we verified this by calculating the scattered light for two different lattice spacings without coupling between the atoms , i.e. , without correlations .",
    "when we applied the scaling transformation to one set of data , we obtained exactly the data for the other distance .",
    "this scaling , however , fails if distant - dependent interactions and thus correlations between the atoms are present .",
    "then , the atomic expectation values entering eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) do depend on distance .",
    "the scaled data obtained with lattice spacing @xmath128 will therefore differ from the results of lattice spacing @xmath127 in those detection directions , in which correlations exist .",
    "thus next , we repeated the procedure with the interaction between the atoms switched on .",
    "now , the difference between the first data set and the scaled second data set is non - zero .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - exp](a ) .",
    "it can be seen that the differing parts reproduce the detection directions we predict in order to measure the atomic correlations to a good degree .",
    "this is not surprising , as the scaling is expected to fail exactly at those detection directions at which correlations modify the result . an experiment could thus measure the scattered light for two lattice spacings , and determine the positions in which correlations can be detected by searching for differences between the scaled first data set and the second data set .",
    "note , however , that the presence of correlations does not necessarily imply a difference between two measurements at different lattice spacings .",
    "therefore , there is no one - to - one correspondence between the theoretical contours and the positions determined using a measurement as outlined above .",
    "a different option is to make use of the angular dependence of the coupling in 1-d atomic arrangements .",
    "if the dipole moments are aligned at different angles with respect to the trap axis , then also the coupling changes  @xcite .    for rri atoms",
    ", it is even simpler to obtain two measurements to compare with in order to determine potential directions in which correlations can be measured .",
    "we found that it is sufficient to take the ratio of two measurements with different @xmath134 , without changing the atom positions or the interaction strength .",
    "[ fig - exp](b ) shows , again the ratio of the two measurements exhibit structures which resemble the detection directions predicted theoretically .",
    "next to the experimental determination of detection directions , this allows for a direct comparison of theory and experiment .",
    "it can be expected that higher - order correlation functions @xmath135 with @xmath136 enable one to detect @xmath0-atom correlations with @xmath137 in a straightforward extension of the present work . increasing the number of atoms , however , while still measuring @xmath4 ,",
    "would not provide direct access to higher order correlations , since only correlations between 4 atomic operators enter the expression of @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , measurements with larger structures are desirable , as a measurement of the scattered light in particular detection directions is required , such that count rates become important .",
    "an alternative could be to combine our method with strong laser driving in modified reservoirs  @xcite to increase photon scattering .",
    "in this work , we have presented results on regular structures of atoms , which could be realized , e.g. , by placing atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the regular structure essentially leads to the formation of interference maxima in particular directions of the light scattering , in which constructive interference of the paths via the different atoms appears .",
    "our results on the correlation measurements , however , are not associated with these interference maxima arising due to the regular structure of the atoms .",
    "therefore we expect that our method also works with random positions of the atoms . to substantiate this expectation , as an example , we have randomly modified the interparticle distances in the chain to @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 in the ddi case , and calculated the results correponding to fig .",
