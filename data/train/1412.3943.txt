    "as we known , galaxies harbor reservoirs of gas know as the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) . the interactions between galaxies and their surrounding media involve the accretion of material that is required to maintain star formation and the dynamical mechanisms that influence the galactic environment , and move the heavy elements ( metal - enriched gas ) produced in the stars of galaxies from their places of production into galactic halos , the cgm , and the intergalactic medium ( igm ; veilleux et al.2005 ; fumagalli et al .",
    "2011 ; heckman et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the latter role would enrich the material for future star formation .",
    "the two kinds of interactions are strongly affected by the galactic winds , filament infall , mergers , high velocity clouds , etc .",
    "( see putman et al.2012for a review ) .    due to the sensitivity of instruments",
    ", however , it is unrealistic to directly observe the fine structures and ingredients of the gaseous clouds harbored by the galaxies , especially for faint galaxies .",
    "fortunately , absorption features are often detected in the spectra of distant objects when their sightlines go through the foreground ( 1 ) high velocity clouds , ( 2 ) igm , ( 3 ) filament gas , ( 4 ) cgm , etc .",
    "these absorption features are a sensitive and unbiased tool for probing the gases of the universe from early periods ( meiksin2009 ) .",
    "absorption features imprinted in the quasar spectra provide us with an excellent opportunity to investigate the gaseous content ( e.g. , densities , ionization structures , metallicities , temperatures , and kinematics ) of extragalactic objects .",
    "these investigations do not depend on the luminosity and redshift of the corresponding quasar , or on the velocity and luminosity of the extra - galactic object which might otherwise be invisible .",
    "the destinies of the galaxies are ultimately connected to the fate of gas within them , and therefore studies of quasar absorption lines are helpful to our understanding of the properties of galaxies ( e.g. , zibetti et al .",

    "neutral- to high - ionization absorption lines have been observed in quasar spectra ( e.g. , misawa et al.2007 ; tombesi et al.2011 ; chen et al .",
    "2013a , 2013d ; chen & qin 2013c ; gupta et al.2013 ) .",
    "these absorption features have historically been divided into three classes according to their line widths : ( 1 ) broad absorption lines ( bals ) with line widths of no less than @xmath12 at depths>10% below the continuum , ( 2 ) narrow absorption lines ( nals ) with line widths of less than a few hundred @xmath13 , and ( 3 ) mini - bals with intermediate line widths between those of bals and nals ( e.g. , weymann et al.1979 ; rodrguez hidalgo et al.2011 ; filiz ak et al.2012 ; hamann et al.2013 ) .    using the quasar spectra of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al.2000 )",
    ", many authors have conducted campaigns to systematically search for narrow metal absorption lines ( e.g. , quider et al .",

    "the sdss program continued with the third sdss ( sdss - iii ) using the same 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al.2006 ; rossetal.2012 ) .",
    "this program collected data from 2008 to 2014 .",
    "the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) is the main dark time legacy survey of sdss - iii ( pris et al .",
    "2012 ) , which has obtained more than 150,000 quasar spectra with @xmath14 during its five year run time .",
    "the boss spectrograph has a wavelength range of 3600  10400    at a resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "the sdss data release nine ( sdss - dr9 ) , which is the first spectral data release of boss to the public , includes 87,822 quasars detected over an area of @xmath16 ( p aris et al .",

    "this paper is the second part in a series aiming to analyze absorption lines in the boss quasar spectra .",

    "chen et al . ( 2014a , 2014b ; hereafter , the two papers are referred to aspaper i ) , we focused on narrow c iv absorption doublets .",
    "paper i concerned those quasars with @xmath18 and a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s /",

    "these criteria limit the detection to 15,278 appropriate quasars for the detection of narrow c iv absorption features . of these 15,278 quasars , 6291 quasars",

    "readers can refer to paper i for more details .    in order to avoid the confusions from @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 absorptions and the noisy region of the spectra , the spectra regions shortward of 1310 in the rest frame or shortward of 3800 in the observed frame are not considered .",
    "in addition , to detect as much of the intervening c iv absorption doublets as possible , we constrain our analysis to the data range within @xmath23 blueward of the quasar system .",
    "these cuts reduce the number of sdss dr9 quasars from 87,822 to 70,336 .",
    "each quasar spectrum has a value of the median s / n ( median s / n ) . based on the median value of the median s / n of these 70,336 quasars ,",
    "median @xmath24 is adopted to alleviate the noise confusion superposed on the spectra with low values of s / n .",

    ", we detect civ absorption on the spectra of the quasars with @xmath26 and @xmath28.,width=7,height=6 ]    for each quasar , a combination of the cubic spline function and gaussian functions was invoked to derive a pseudo - continuum in an iterative fashion ( e.g. , nestor et al.2005 ; chen et al.2013a,2013d,2013b ; chen & qin2013c ) .",
    "civ absorption doublets were detected on the pseudo - continuum fitting normalized spectra .",

    "second , bals are disregarded by the program searching for candidate absorptions . third , in this program , a gaussian function is adopted to fit each absorption feature , while the absorption figures with fwhm greater than @xmath30 are ignored .",
    "fourth , measurements of the equivalent widths at rest - frame ( @xmath8 ) of the candidate absorptions are based on the gaussian fittings , and estimations of their flux uncertainties are performed via @xmath31 where , as a function of pixel , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the line profile centered at @xmath35 , the wavelength , and the normalized flux uncertainty , respectively .",

    "based on the value determined by formula ( 2 ) , we can obtain the signal - to - noise ratio of the candidate absorption line via @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the largest depth within an absorption trough with respect to the pseudo - continuum fitting in the normalized spectra .",
    "fifthly , all absorption features with @xmath46    and @xmath47 for both lines of the doublet are kept in the catalog .    using the same method as in paper i",

    "<S> as the second work in a series of papers aiming to detect absorption systems in the quasar spectra of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey , we continue the analysis of paper i by expanding the quasar sample to those quasars with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a sample of 21,963 appropriate quasars to search for narrow @xmath1 absorptions with @xmath2    for both lines . </S>",
    "<S> there are 9708 quasars with at least one appropriate absorption system imprinted on their spectra . from these spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we detect 13,919 narrow civabsorption systems whose absorption redshifts cover a range of @xmath3  @xmath4 . in this paper and paper 1 , </S>",
    "<S> we have selected 37,241 appropriate quasars with median @xmath5 and @xmath6 to visually analyze narrow @xmath1 absorption doublets one by one . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 15,999 quasars are found to have at least one appropriate absorption system imprinted on their spectra . from these 15,999 quasar spectra , </S>",
    "<S> we have detected 23,336 appropriate @xmath1 absorption systems with @xmath2 whose absorption redshifts cover a range of @xmath7  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the largest values of @xmath8 are 3.19    for the @xmath9 absorption line and 2.93    for the @xmath10 absorption line , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only a few absorbers show large values of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> about 1.1% absorbers of the total absorbers have @xmath11  . </S>"
