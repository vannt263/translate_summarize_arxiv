    "ever since their discovery , the behavior of high - t@xmath5 materials in a magnetic field has seemed mysterious@xcite . unlike the conventional low - t@xmath5 type - ii materials ,",
    "high - t@xmath5 superconductors ( htsc s ) show a broad region in the magnetic - field / temperature ( h - t ) plane where the abrikosov lattice has apparently melted into a _ liquid _ state@xcite .",
    "considerable recent evidence now suggests that flux lattice ( fl ) melting is a _ first - order _ phase transition . on the experimental side ,",
    "a local magnetization jump has been measured by network of hall microprobes@xcite on and has been associated with the melting transition .",
    "the transition thus observed seems to lie quite near the melting curve as determined from low angle neutron diffraction@xcite and @xmath6sr experiments@xcite .",
    "more recently , schilling _",
    "et al_@xcite have directly observed the latent heat of the transition in along a line @xmath7 in the @xmath8 phase diagram which agrees well with mechanical and transport measurements@xcite .",
    "numerical evidence for a first order melting transition has been obtained from simulations based on a frustrated @xmath1 model@xcite , and from a lowest landau level model which is expected to be most accurate at high magnetic field@xcite .",
    "first order melting has also been observed numerically in a system of unbreakable flux lines described by a lawrence - doniach model@xcite .",
    "all these simulations are based on a large density of flux lines ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "an anomalous feature of the local hall probe measurements is that the apparent first order transition line seems to terminate at a critical point above which the latent heat vanishes@xcite . since on symmetry grounds",
    "a first order `` melting '' line can not terminate in a critical point@xcite , this critical point may suggest that the first order melting line is instead intersecting another phase transition line related to the disorder . a related issue is the entropy released per vortex per layer across the transition line .",
    "this entropy increases very rapidly as the field decreases .",
    "such behavior is difficult to accounted for within a model based only on the field induced vortices .    in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the lattice becomes unstable at high fields against proliferation of quenched - in topological defects@xcite , possibly through a first order phase transition across a horizontal ( constant h ) line in the h - t plane .",
    "this line then may meet the temperature - driven melting line , causing it to terminate .",
    "somewhere along this line , the melting transition may be converted into the universality class of the continuous vortex glass transition@xcite , characterized by divergent correlation lengths and times .",
    "another unresolved issue regarding the phase diagram is the possibility of reentrant melting at low fields .",
    "reentrant flux lattice melting is expected because of screening of the widely - separated vortex lines at low fields@xcite .",
    "it has been recently reported in single - crystal @xmath10 sample@xcite , based on tracking of the so - called `` peak effect''@xcite .",
    "such reentrance behavior has been observed only at the limited field range by ling _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the melting curve tracked by the micro - hall probe@xcite seems to monotonically approach the zero - field superconducting transition at @xmath11 even for fields as low as a few gauss .",
    "fl melting can also be probed by transport measurement .",
    "but since such measurements are non - equilibrium , they offer only an indirect means of studying _ equilibrium _ fl melting . in real materials with disorder",
    ", the interpretation of transport measurement is further complicated by the many competing energy scales . in single - crystal ,",
    "the in - plane resistivity exhibits a discontinuous jump and hysteresis which have been identified with a first - order melting transition@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the peak effect in the critical current occurs at slightly lower temperatures than the resistivity jump , leading some workers to postulate that there is a `` premelting '' phenomenon@xcite in this material , in addition to melting . in ,",
    "simultaneous transport and local magnetization measurements@xcite show that the jump in local magnetization @xmath12 coincides ( at high fields ) with a jump in the resistivity @xmath13 from zero to a finite value , or ( in low fields ) the continuous development of a finite @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , at high fields , the jumps in @xmath14 and @xmath12 are accompanied by hysteresis .",
    "together , these phenomena strongly suggest first order flux lattice melting at high fields . at low fields ,",
    "the experiments are more ambiguous .",
    "fl melting has been widely studied numerically .",
    "the possibility of _ two stage _",
    "melting was first suggested by li and teitel@xcite for a model with infinite penetration depth @xmath15 , and later for a system with finite @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the calculations of li and teitel are based on the so - called frustrated xy model with fairly low flux per plaquette of @xmath16 ( in units of the flux quantum @xmath17 ) on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "they find that the three - dimensional flux line lattice ( 3d fll ) melts first into a `` line liquid '' characterized by disentangled flux lines , which become entangled at a second , higher-@xmath18 phase transition .",
    "current - voltage ( iv ) measurements in the so - called `` flux transformer '' geometry@xcite provide some support for this picture .",
    "specifically , they suggest that fl melting is signaled by the onset of finite in - plane resistance , while in an applied current , phase coherence is lost in the @xmath19 direction only at a distinctly higher temperature . on the other hand , simulations of dense ( f=1/6 ) flux lines on a stacked triangular grid favor a single transition@xcite .",
    "dynamical calculations@xcite on a triangular lattice at @xmath20 suggest that if there are two separate transitions , they arise from pins , either intrinsic to the discrete cubic grid , or put in by hand .",
    "yet more recent studies based on a london vortex loop model on a simple cubic lattice show that superconducting order disappears apparently in two steps , the sequence of which depends on the lattice anisotropy@xcite , although it is argued to be a finite size effect by the same authors@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to resolve some of these issues by considering the frustrated @xmath1 model over a _ wide range of flux densities _ , using both static and dynamic simulations but with no quenched disorder . by examining this model on a stacked triangular lattice",
    ", we minimize the unphysical periodic pinning due to the lattice . by working at relatively low densities ,",
    "we focus on the regime , now being probed experimentally , where the xy phase fluctuations ( vortex loops ) are as important as those of _ field induced _ vortex lines@xcite .",
    "our main conclusion is that there are , in fact signatures of two separate transitions at low fields , which are not artifacts of pinning by the discrete grid .",
    "the transition at lower temperature is unambiguously associated with vortex lattice melting .",
    "the second transition may be a sharp crossover rather than a true phase transition . nevertheless , it is responsible for several experimental features ( such as sharp increases in local magnetization and in resistance ) which are often identified as evidence for a first order melting transition .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ modelsec ] , we describe our model and its numerical solution .",

    "the most obvious approach to the dynamics of this model would be to use free boundary conditions , injecting current into one face of the lattice and extracting it from the opposite , with periodic transverse boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "but this has the following disadvantage .",
    "once the flux lattice is depinned from its underlying periodic pinning potential , it will drift along _ as a whole _ under the influence of the lorentz force provided by the driving current .",
    "since this occurs equally in the solid and the liquid state , such a geometry may not distinguish clearly between flux lattice and flux liquid ( in the absence of spatially inhomogeneous pinning centers ) .",
    "this problem may be even more conspicuous in our stacked triangular geometry , since the critical current @xmath106 for depinning a single vortex pancake from the underlying triangular grid at zero temperature ( t = 0 ) is smaller ( @xmath107 ) than in a square grid ( @xmath108)@xcite .",

    "thus @xmath160 somewhat resembles a bond - percolation transition , although @xmath160 does not correspond to the percolation threshold , but to a point where connected cluster first forms a @xmath174 dimensional manifold if the system is in dimension @xmath175 .",
    "because such infinite clusters occur , it appears that the behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ f0plfig ] is not a consequence of the finite simulation cell , but persists in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "evidently , just at the xy transition , the system becomes filled with thermally generated vortex segments , _ one per grain , or elemental cell_. below @xmath176 , while there may exist vortex loops of arbitrary size , the number of these , @xmath183 , falls off exponentially for large clusters ( cf .",
    "[ f0plfig ] ) .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath184 @xmath183 diminishes algebraically with @xmath185 .",
    "this subtle change in @xmath183 implies that the average size of the connected vortex tangle remains finite for @xmath172 , but diverges above it@xcite .",
    "we find that there are numerous _",
    "finite _ vortex loops at temperatures as low as 0.5@xmath160 . moreover , at any given temperature , we find that a large bias current further enhances both their number and their size .",
    "a simple argument suggests that the dissipation below @xmath176 may be exponentially activated .",
    "the effective energy for a vortex loop of radius @xmath186 oriented normal to a uniform driving current density @xmath187 is @xmath188 - c \\cdot \\pi r^2 j$ ] , where @xmath15 is the penetration depth .",
    "thus , there is a barrier to loop expansion with a critical radius @xmath189 and height @xmath190 for sufficiently small j , only those vortex loops of size @xmath191 will expand and contribute to dissipation . from our simulations , for @xmath172 , @xmath183 decays exponentially .",
    "therefore , the small dissipation involving the expansion of thermally nucleated vortex rings should have an activated temperature - dependence for @xmath172 , resulting in highly nonlinear iv characteristics .",

    "both quantities vanish close to @xmath204 , the melting temperature as determined from the double peaks in the energy histogram@xcite .",
    "the apparent melting @xmath205 , slightly higher than inferred from the energy histogram , seems to be due to a superheating effect .",
    "the occurrence of only a single phase transition at @xmath20@xcite is not surprising : at this field , there is one vortex pancake for every three grains , and hence , only three phase degrees of freedom per pancake .",
    "thus , most potential vortex excitations are already exhausted by the lateral fluctuations of field - induced vortex lines in the liquid phase .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[f6linesfig ] , where we show two typical vortex configurations , one slightly below and the other above the melting transition .",
    "clearly , the transverse line fluctuations quickly dominate the thermodynamics above @xmath199 .",
    "the strong first order transition at @xmath206 can be then understood by the close connection between the lateral line fluctuations and incipient vortex loops .",

    "as we pointed out earlier@xcite , @xmath206 with @xmath586 ( @xmath587 ) represents a situation where the interlayer decoupling sets in right at the melting transition . from our numerical results with @xmath588 varying from @xmath542 to @xmath34 ,",
    "we believe that there is a universal crossover value of scaled density @xmath588 between @xmath542 and @xmath589 which separates a _ low field _ regime from the _ high field _",
    "regime for which @xmath590 koshelev@xcite made a numerical observation that @xmath591 however , it is again made for @xmath592 , i.  e.   @xmath593 , equivalent to an extremely dense limit .",

    "the technical difficulty of simulating the very low field limit @xmath598 with large number of field induced vortex lines remains largely unsurmounted . to minimize the artificial grid pinning effect , one is required to choose a fairly small value of @xmath52 ( @xmath599 for the square grid , @xmath600 for the triangular grid )",

    "may still be considered superconducting in the sense that a superconducting path , however narrow , may exist across a macroscopic distance along @xmath295 , which defines a tiny , but finite critical current .",
    "this may be enhanced by collective pinning of the single lines , but resistance measured with a large driving will show a non - linear iv characteristics and hysteresis as current has to distribute itself among the superconducting paths and normal channels .",
    "the field induced lines in the low field limit , if we take the world - line analogy , are equivalent to extremely massive bosons and eventually drop out of the thermodynamics .",
    "they become localized charges which tend to polarize the underlying vacuum and induce a _",
    "dielectric breakdown _ as the xy medium become more and more polarizable as t increases toward @xmath579 .",
    "it is somewhat similar to a _ metal - insulator _ transition in a narrow band - gap semiconductor in which local field gradient(due to the field induced vortices ) and shrinking band gap ( as @xmath603 ) conspire to a massive generation of screening dipole pairs ( vortex loops ) leading to a metallic state .",
    "to summarize , we confirmed the existence of a single first order melting transition at high vortex densities .",
    "we also showed that upon melting the local vortex density increases due to the screening effect of thermally generated vortex loops .",
    "more significantly , however , we observed that , in the absence of disorder , destruction of phase coherence in a superconductor may proceed by two separate transitions at low magnetic fields : a quasi - long range phase coherence parallel to the field disappears at a temperature @xmath4 higher than @xmath199 at which the lattice periodicity disappears and true long range phase coherence is lost . in this low - field regime , the lattice first melts into a liquid of lines with a finite entanglement length along the applied field .",
    "these lines eventually disappear through increasing entanglement , and through their interaction with thermally induced vortex and antivortex loops . while the melting transition is best characterized by the disappearance of bragg peaks for the vortex lines and a delta function peak in the specific heat",
    ", there is a narrow region above @xmath199 where we observe dramatic changes in dissipation tensor which coincide with jump in the local vortex density and disappearance of the longitudinal phase rigidity , @xmath604 . instead of being a gradual crossover",
    ", we propose that a possible transition at @xmath605 sets in at low densities .",
    "it tracks the broad peak in specific heat as b increases , obeying the behavior of 3d zero field xy system confined to a semi - infinite slab of finite thickness @xmath606 it can alternatively described in terms of appearence of connected vortex tangle which effectively leads to decoupling of neighbouring layers . within this picture ,",
