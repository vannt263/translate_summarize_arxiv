    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary systems hosting a main - sequence secondary ( sometimes a slightly evolved star ) and a primary component , a white dwarf ( wd ) ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the accretion process occurs mainly through an accretion disc in cases where the wd does not have substantial magnetic field to channel the accretion flow onto the wd via the field lines .",
    "these systems are typically categorized by their eruptive behavior like classical novae , recurrent novae and dwarf novae ( z cam type , u gem type , su uma type etc ) . in nonmagnetic systems",
    "x - rays are produced in the shocks at the inner disc boundary layer ( patterson @xmath13 raymond 1985 ; verbunt et al .",
    "1997 ; baskill , wheatley @xmath13 osborne 2005 ) .",
    "these systems show hard x - ray spectra with 3 - 10 kev temperatures . in magnetic cv systems ( mcvs )",
    "accreting matter is funneled by the magnetic field of the wd onto the magnetic poles forming a strong shock .",
    "the mcvs are classified into two categories where synchronized / almost synchronized systems are called polars ( cropper 1990 ; ramsay @xmath13 cropper 2004 ) with magnetic fields in a range of 10 - 530 mg , these systems are characterized as being discless .",
    "the spectra of polars may show the hot ( above 10 kev temperature ) hard x - ray tails if the accreting flow is dense and the magnetic fields are low ( @xmath1410@xmath15 m@xmath16 yr@xmath11 ) whereas more rarified streams and stronger magnetic fields favor cyclotron cooling where the hard x - ray tails are suppressed .",
    "soft x - ray emission ( via reprocessing ) is enhanced once the accretion rate is @xmath1710@xmath18 m@xmath16 yr@xmath11 ( schmidt et al . 2005 ) .",
    "highly asynchronous systems are called intermediate polars ( patterson 1994 ; hellier 1996 ; norton , wynn & somerscales 2004 and references therein ) with magnetic fields in a range less than 10 mg where a truncated disc exists .",
    "these systems show hard x - ray bremsstrahlung spectra with 10 - 30 kev temperatures .",
    "classical nova rr pic had an outburst in 1925 as a slow nova ( expansion speed @xmath14 400 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the shell shows `` equatorial ring and polar cap / blob '' geometry .",
    "there are similarities and important differences between the spectra in the ring and blob regions ( in c and o lines ) with a shell size of 30@xmath19x21@xmath19 and expansion rate of 850 km s@xmath11 for the ring ( gill @xmath13 obrien 1998 ) .",
    "the distance of the nova is measured to be 600@xmath160 pc ( gill @xmath13 obrien 1998 ) .",
    "the point source rr pic has an orbital period of p@xmath20@xmath14 0.@xmath2114502545(7 ) ( kubiak 1984 ) .",
    "a different periodicity of 15 min is detected by kubiak ( 1984 ) and accounted for the white dwarf period ; hence making the source a candidate for intermediate polars .",
    "however , haefner and schoembs ( 1985 ) could not find the 15 min period with high - resolution photometry and concluded that the 15 min period is a transient event in the disc rather than the period of the white dwarf .",
    "warner ( 1986 ) also confirms the absence of this 15 min period .",
    "additionally he also finds flickering activity independent of the orbital phase coming from the disc itself rather than the hot spot and the system .",
    "another period of 0.1577 days is also found interpreted as the superhump period of the system ( schmidtobreick et al .",
    "furthermore , the source has a hardness ratio similar to polars and the source spectrum in general differs compared with the non - magnetic cvs ( van teeseling , beuermann @xmath13 verbunt 1996 ) .",
    "polarization measurements indicate the existence of two components of emission , one associated with a hot spot in the disc and the other in the preceding side of the disc opposite of the hot spot ( haefner @xmath13 metz 1982 ) .",
    "kubiak ( 1984 ) stated that the main optical light source in the system and the optical eclipse is due to the eclipse of the hot spot by the secondary .",
    "however , schmidtobreick , tappert @xmath13 saviane ( 2003 ) conclude that the eclipse is due to occultation of the emission from the preceding side rather than the hot spot .",
    "[ 1 ]    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , < , > , < , > \" , ]",
    "the @xmath0 acis - s spectrum of rr pic fits well with two spectral models .",
    "first one is a composite model of single bremsstrahlung , photoelectric absorption , two absorption lines and 5 gaussian lines at 2 - 3@xmath7 confidence level .",
    "another good fit is with vmcflow model with enhanced abundances of he , c , n , o and ne .",
    "the good fitting models are consistent with each other since the gaussian lines of the composite model are also in accordance with the abundances of vmcflow",
    ".    the x - ray luminosity can be calculated as ( 1.1@xmath10.2)@xmath410@xmath12 erg s@xmath11 ( using the relation l=4@xmath22d@xmath23f ) .",
    "assuming the accretion luminosity is half the total luminosity ; taking the mass and the radius of the white dwarf to be 1 m@xmath16 and 10@xmath24 cm , respectively ; the accretion rate @xmath25 is 1.7@xmath410@xmath26 g s@xmath11 ( using the relation l = g@xmath25m/2r ) . these values are consistent with those of the nonmagnetic cvs in quiescent state ( baskill et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the fit residuals , in general , show some excess ( particularly with vmcflow model ) on the harder energy part of the spectrum . in order to understand the nature of the excess , spatially resolved spectra around the position of the source",
    "was extracted from the south - southeast and north - northwest regions of the source in accordance with the results of balman 2002 and 2006 .",
    "both regions fit well with the composite model noted in table 1 of bremsstrahlung and emission lines .",
    "however , a 2 - 3 @xmath7 hard excess in the south - southeast region needs an additional bremsstrahlung component to be added to decrease the reduced @xmath27 values down to desirable levels below 2 .",
    "this component has very high absorption around 50@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath10 and plasma temperature in a range 0.36 - 0.70 kev .",
    "this excess emission can be attributed to emission from the shocked nova shell . in order to investigate this",
    "using the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions one can derive a relation between the post - shock temperature and expansion speed of the material ( nova ejecta or the ring ) as kt@xmath28=(3/16)@xmath29m@xmath30(v@xmath31)@xmath32 .",
    "taking v@xmath31 as 400 - 850 km s@xmath11 range for rr pic ( see introduction ) , the shocked nova shell temperature is 0.31 - 1.4 kev consistent with our derived fit result suggesting a component from the nova shell .",
    "moreover , the high absorption towards this component can be expected if it is of the reverse shock , high absorption in the reserve shock was also detected for the shell of gk persei ( balman 2005 ) .",
    "the abundances of he , c , n and o derived from the fits to the source spectrum with the vmcflow model are significantly enhanced , where fits with solar abundances are ruled out with reduced @xmath27 larger than 2 .",
    "this means that the x - ray emitting region in the point source consists of enhanced abundances of these elements which can be explained by the mixing that has occurred in this system .",
    "prior to the thermonuclear runaway in a classical nova explosion , diffusion by convection takes place between the hydrogen rich boundary layer and the white dwarf where heavier elements such as he , c , n and o are present ( livio 1994 ) .",
    "hence , as heavier elements diffuse into the boundary layer , the abundances are increased .",
    "what we observe in the spectrum of rr pic can be a very rare example of diffusive mixing in a classical nova .",
    "the light curve of the source shows variation folded on the orbital period with a modulation amplitude of 0.02 counts s@xmath11 with @xmath3333 statistical error . comparing the spectra of the orbital maximum and minimum of the source reveals that the x - ray modulation could be due to the change in the difference in photoelectric absorption between the two phases . in order to explain this",
    ", an analogy to the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be used . in some lmxbs",
    ", the x - ray intensity shows dipping behaviour during the orbital motion , caused largely by the obscuration of the x - rays by the region where the accreting material impacts the disc ( white @xmath13 swank 1982 ) .",
    "thus in our case , the x - ray modulation can be due to the obscuration by a warm / cold region on the disc , similar to lmxbs . as parker , norton and mukai ( 2005 ) states ,",
    "a similar orbital modulation is also present in some cvs .",
    "their work suggests that decrease of modulation depth with increasing energy implies photoelectric absorption due to material at the edge of the disc for the systems they have studied .",
    "furthermore , according to the doppler tomography analysis of rr pic by schmidtobreick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a strong emission region is detected at phase 0.3 opposite the bright hot spot ( i.e. , accretion impact region ) . using their radial velocity ephemeris",
    ", we find that the x - ray eclipse / dip corresponds to the same orbital phase 0.3 .",
    "therefore this supports the idea that the x - ray modulation is due to an absorbing region on the disc .",
    "the two absorption features that are detected in the spectrum of rr pic around 1.1 - 1.2 kev are not accounted for before in any cv .",
    "we also checked the data against any instrumental feature or processing differences between software versions and the features are persistent.they can be fitted with absorption lines corresponding to ne ix and fe ( transitions between xvii  xxii ) for the first , and ne x and fe ( transitions between xiv ",
    "xxvi ) for the second feature .",
    "these features could be caused by a region on the disc or the shell itself in the line of sight .",
    "further investigation of the spectrum could prove useful in finding the origin of these features .",
    "we present the first broad x - ray spectrum of rr pic in the 0.2 - 10.0 kev range using chandra acis - s3 observations .",
    "the spectrum of the source shows a bremsstrahlung temperature in the range 1 - 1.6 kev that is consistent with the temperature range of the non - magnetic cvs of 1 - 5 kev ( kuulkers et .",
    "al 2006 ) .",
    "emission lines of the elements fe ( transitions between xvii and xxiv , ( fe l complex ) ) , s ( xiv and xvi ) , ca ( transitions between xv and xvii ) , ne ( ix , x ) , o ( vii , viii ) , c vi ; and absorption lines of elements fe ( transitions between xvii and xxiv ) , ne ( x , ix ) and na x are consistent with the spectrum . in order to determine the exact transitions of the emission and absorption lines , observations with higher sensitivity and resolution",
    "is needed .",
    "the absorption features detected in the spectrum are particularly important since no absorption feature at these energies were detected before in any cv .",
    "so a secure detection / confirmation of the absorption lines would be a novel discovery if further observations are carried out .",
    "the spectrum clearly fits well with vmcflow model rather than the @xmath34 model which implies that the x - rays from the system arises from a shocked cooling flow plasma . from the vmcflow fit ,",
    "we derive temperature range with hight=1.8@xmath35 kev and lowt=0.14@xmath36 kev .",
    "the fit also reveals high abundance ratios with respect to the solar abundances such as 18.4@xmath37 , 1.7@xmath38 , 8.7@xmath39 and 1.9@xmath40 for he , c , n and o respectively .",
    "these abundance enhancements indicate existing mixing in the boundary layer .",
    "the high he and n abundances indicate hydrogen burning which would be a consequent result of a nuclear burning stage of a classical nova explosion . so the spectrum of rr pic demonstrates a very rare example of diffusive mixing prior to and after the thermonuclear runaway in a classical nova detected long years after the explosion .",
    "we also find excess emisison in the spectra ( 2 - 3@xmath7 ) that we attribute the origin to be the shocked nova shell with a temperature of 0.3 - 0.7 kev .",
    "we clearly detect the orbital modulation of rr pic in the x - ray wavelengths . using the ephemeris given by schmidtobreick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the phase of the x - ray eclipse of the system overlaps with the phase of the emission region from the disc opposite of the bright spot .",
    "we also find that the neutral hydrogen column density differs for orbital minimum and orbital maximum spectra with values ( 0.25@xmath3)@xmath410@xmath5 and ( 0.64@xmath6)@xmath410@xmath5 at 3@xmath7  confidence level .",
    "therefore we favor a model where a possible warm / cold absorbing region on the disc or line of sight , the nova shell , modifiying the spectrum .",
