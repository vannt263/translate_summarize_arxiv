    "for many years , it was thought that fermi statistics were fundamental , in the sense that one could only obtain a theory with fermionic excitations by introducing them by hand ( via anti - commuting fields ) .",
    "then , over the past two decades , this view began to change .",
    "a number of real world and theoretical examples showed that fermions and anyons could _ emerge _ as low energy collective modes of purely bosonic systems .",
    "the first examples along these lines were the fractional quantum hall states .",
    "@xcite usually we think of the fqh states as examples of anyonic excitations emerging from interacting fermions .",
    "however , from a purely theoretical point of view , the same effects should occur in systems of interacting bosons in a magnetic field.@xcite there were also indications of emerging fermions in the slave - boson approach to spin-1/2 systems@xcite and in the study of resonating valence bond ( rvb ) states.@xcite unfortunately , the rvb picture and the slave boson approach both rely on approximate or mean - field techniques to construct and analyze these exotic states .",
    "more recently , a number of researchers have introduced exactly soluble or quasi - exactly soluble models with emerging fermions .",
    "@xcite these models allow for a more well - controlled analysis , albeit in very specific cases .    the mean - field approach and the exactly - soluble examples both provide clues to the structure and basic properties of bosonic models with fermionic excitations .",
    "they indicate , among other things , that fermions never appear alone in lattice spin systems .",
    "instead they always come together with a nontrivial gauge field and the emerging fermions are associated with the deconfined phase of the gauge field.@xcite the deconfined phases always seem to contain a new kind of order - topological order,@xcite and the emerging fermions and anyons are intimately related to the new order .",
    "this was particularly apparent in the context of the slave - boson approach . in this technique",
    ", one expresses a spin-1/2 hamiltonian in terms of fermion fields and gauge fields.@xcite clearly , the presence of fermion fields does not , by itself , imply the existence of fermionic quasi - particles - the fermions appear only when the gauge field is in the _ deconfined _ phase .",
    "constructed several deconfined phases where the fermion fields do describe well defined quasi - particles .",
    "depending on the properties of the deconfined phases , these quasi - particles can carry fractional statistics ( for the chiral spin states ) @xcite or fermi statistics ( for the @xmath2 deconfined states).@xcite    although it was less evident initially , a similar picture has emerged from the study of rvb states and the associated quantum dimer models . originally proposed that fermions ( spinons ) could emerge from a nearest neighbor dimer model on a square lattice .",
    "later , it was realized that the fermions couple to a @xmath2 gauge field , and the fermionic excitations only appear when the field is in the deconfined phase.@xcite it turns out that the dimer liquid on square lattice with only nearest neighbor dimers is not in the deconfined phase ( except at a critical point).@xcite however , on a triangular lattice , the dimer liquid does have a @xmath2 deconfined phase.@xcite the results in are valid in this case and fermionic quasi - particles do emerge in a dimer liquid on a triangular lattice .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to clarify these observations and to put them on firmer foundations .",
    "we give a general argument which shows that emerging fermions always occur together with a nontrivial deconfined gauge field .",
    "in addition , we derive an algebraic formula that allows one to calculate the statistics of a lattice particle from the properties of its hopping operators .",
    "we feel that this formula both elucidates the fundamental meaning of statistics in a lattice system and simplifies their computation .",
    "this approach has the added advantage that it works in any number of dimensions - unlike the flux binding picture@xcite developed in fqh theory .",
    "we would like to point out that all the previously mentioned examples of emerging fermions are two dimensional models .",
    "the emerging fermions in those models are related to the flux binding picture in .",
    "our algebraic approach allows us to establish the emergence of fermions in an exactly soluble 3d bosonic model .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we give a definition of the statistics of a lattice particle . in the second section",
    ", we derive the algebraic statistics formula discussed above . in the third section , we apply the formula to the case of fermionic ( or anyonic ) excitations in a lattice spin system .",
    "the formula demands that the fermions always come in pairs , and that their pair creation operator has a string - like structure with the newly created particles appearing at the ends .",
    "we show that the strings represent gauge fluctuations , and the fermions carry the corresponding gauge charge . after presenting the general argument",
    ", we devote the last two sections to exactly soluble examples of this phenomenon in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the above result suggests a very interesting picture of emerging fermions .",
    "fermions and gauge fields appear to be two sides of the same coin : in some sense , fermions are the ends of strings and gauge fields are the fluctuations of strings",
    ". extended string - like structures seem to be the key to understanding both fermi statistics and gauge fields .",
    "what do we mean when we say that a particle is a `` boson '' or a `` fermion '' ?",
    "the most common way to define statistics is to use the algebra of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "if these operators satisfy the bosonic algebra , the corresponding particles are said to be bosons ; if they satisfy the fermionic algebra , the particles are said to be fermions .    in this paper , we will use another , equivalent , definition based on the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics . given any @xmath3 particle system with short - range interactions",
    ", we can write down the corresponding multi - particle action @xmath4 . the most general action @xmath4 has two components : @xmath5 the first term , @xmath6 , can be any local expression .",
    "typically , it s just the usual classical action .",
    "the second term , @xmath7 , is less familiar . in general",
    ", it can be any expression which only depends on the topology ( e.g. homotopy class ) of paths . in @xmath1 or more dimensions , the form of @xmath7",
    "is highly constrained . the amplitude for a closed path @xmath8 must be of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of particle exchanges that occur in @xmath8 .",
    "the statistics of the particles are defined by the sign in this expression .",
    "if this sign is positive , we say the particles are``bosons '' , if the sign is negative , the particles are `` fermions '' . in @xmath0 dimensions , there are other , more complicated possibilities for @xmath7 .",
    "these particles are called `` anyons . ''",
    "according to this definition , the statistics are completely determined by the topological term @xmath7 in the action .",
    "one way to isolate this term is to compare the amplitude for two paths which are the same locally ( this will be made more precise in the next section ) but differ in their global properties . in particular , we can compare the amplitude for a path which exchanges two particles with another path which is the same locally , but does nt exchange the two particles .",
    "the difference between the phases of the two amplitudes is then precisely @xmath11 , the statistical phase .",
    "we now reformulate this ( theoretical ) test of statistics so that it can be applied to particles on a lattice .",
    "the prescription is as follows : we take a two particle state @xmath12 , and consider a product of hopping amplitudes along a lattice path which exchanges the particles @xmath13 each hopping amplitude in this expression involves one of the two particles moving to a neighboring site while the other particle remains fixed . at the end",
    ", the two particles have exchanged places : @xmath14 .",
    "now we construct another path which is the same locally , but does nt exchange the two particles , and take a product of hopping amplitudes along this path .",
    "the claim is that the difference between the phases of these two expressions is precisely the statistical phase of the particles .",
    "that is , the particles are bosons , fermions , or anyons depending on whether the phase difference is @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or something else .    one way to see this is to remember the derivation of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "according to the standard derivation , the amplitude @xmath17 for a two particle path @xmath18 is given by a product @xmath19 in the limit that @xmath20 .",
    "now , in the discrete ( lattice ) case , the above expression can be further simplified . since @xmath21 , we can rewrite it as @xmath22 successive states @xmath23 must either be identical , or",
    "must differ by a single particle hop .",
    "the matrix elements between identical states do nt contribute to the phase .",
    "thus , we can drop them without affecting our result .",
    "we are left with : @xmath24 where the @xmath25s are all distinct .",
    "now , as we discussed earlier , the statistical phase can be obtained by comparing the phase of this amplitude with another amplitude which is the same locally but does nt exchange the two particles .",
    "when we make this comparison , the factors of @xmath26 drop out ( since they contribute equally to the two products ) .",
    "thus , it suffices to compare products of the form : @xmath27 this is precisely the expression in .",
    "in this section we derive a simple algebraic formula for the statistics of a particle hopping on a lattice .",
    "this formula is completely general and holds irrespective of whether the particles are fundamental or are low energy excitations of an underlying condensed matter system ( e.g. quasi - particles ) .",
    "we begin with a hilbert space which describes @xmath10 hard - core particles hopping on a @xmath28 dimensional lattice .",
    "the states can be labeled by listing the positions of the @xmath10 particles : @xmath29 .",
    "the particles are identical so the states @xmath29 do not depend on the order of @xmath30 .",
    "for example , @xmath31    a typical hamiltonian for this system is of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 are `` hopping operators '' with the property that @xmath34 we assume that the hopping is local , _ i.e _ @xmath35=0 \\label{loc}\\ ] ] if @xmath36 are all different .",
    "our goal is to compute the statistics of the particles described by this hopping hamiltonian @xmath37 . in the following ,",
    "we show that the statistical angle can be derived from the simple algebraic properties of the hopping operators .",
    "more precisely , we show that the particles obey statistics @xmath38 if @xmath39 for any three hopping operators @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are ( distinct ) neighbors of @xmath42 ( ordered in the clockwise direction in the case of @xmath0 dimensions ) . the orientation convention in @xmath0 dimensions is necessary for the anyonic case .    the simplest examples where we can apply this formula are the cases of noninteracting hard - core bosons or fermions .",
    "in these cases the @xmath10 particle hamiltonian can be written as @xmath43 where the @xmath44 s are the boson or fermion annihilation operators .",
    "the hopping operators are just @xmath45 .",
    "a little algebra confirms that the boson and fermion hopping operators do indeed satisfy with @xmath46 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we now give a general derivation of the formula .",
    "we begin with the state @xmath47 which contains particles at sites @xmath48 and other particles far away .",
    "imagine that we exchange the two particles at @xmath48 using an appropriate product of hopping operators .",
    "one expression for the final swapped state is @xmath49 here , we ve grouped the hopping operators into 5 terms .",
    "each of these terms moves a particle along some path on the lattice .",
    "the cumulative effect of all 5 terms is to exchange the particles ( see fig .",
    "[ stat]a ) .",
    "similarly , we can construct a path which does nt swap the two particles .",
    "one expression for the final unswapped state is @xmath50 once again , we ve grouped the hopping operators into 5 terms . in this case , the cumulative effect of these terms is simply to move the two particles along independent loops without any swapping taking place ( see fig . [",
    "stat]b ) .    .",
    "the numbers label the order in which the paths are traversed .",
    "( b ) the path of the particles in the unswapped state @xmath51 .",
    "notice that the two states only differ in the ordering of the paths .",
    "however , in one case the particles switch places , while in the other , they do not.,width=240 ]    intuitively , we expect that the phase difference between the swapped and unswapped states is related to the statistical phase of the particles .",
    "in fact , the special way we ve constructed our states allows us to make a much stronger statement .",
    "notice that the two states involve the same product of hopping operators .",
    "the only difference is the order of these operators .",
    "this means that , in the swapped and unswapped states , the two particles trace out the same total path in configuration space .",
    "this is important because it implies that any phase which comes from gauge fields or other berry phases contributes equally to the swapped and unswapped states .",
    "the phase difference between the swapped and unswapped states is therefore exactly equal to the statistical phase of the particles .",
    "this intuitive argument can be made rigorous using the discussion in the previous section .",
    "indeed , it s not hard to see that the two space - time paths traced out by the swapped and unswapped states are exactly the same locally - they only differ by a reordering .",
    "furthermore , the phase difference between the swapped and unswapped states can be written as a phase difference between two expressions of the form ( [ prod ] ) .",
    "thus , taking the phase difference between the swapped and unswapped states is completely equivalent to the procedure derived in the previous section .",
    "we now compute this phase difference .",
    "we use the assumed algebraic relation @xmath52 applying this relation to the swapped state and reordering the hopping operators using locality , we find @xmath53 the phase difference is @xmath38 , so the particles obey statistics @xmath38 , as claimed . a similar formula can be derived for the relative statistics of distinguishable particles .",
    "this formula , together with its derivation , is given in the appendix .",
    "in this section we consider the properties of a lattice spin system with fermionic or anyonic excitations .",
    "we argue that the excitations are always created in pairs , and the creation operator for a pair of particles has a string - like structure , with the new particles located at the ends .",
    "one interpretation of this is that fermions never appear alone - they always come with some kind of gauge field .",
    "we now make these statements more precise .",
    "suppose we have a lattice spin system with fermionic excitations ( the anyonic case is completely analogous ) .",
    "the total hilbert space of the lattice spin model is a direct product of local hilbert spaces @xmath54 , each associated with an individual lattice site @xmath55 .",
    "we expect that the total hilbert space contains a low energy subspace which is spanned by @xmath10 fermion states .",
    "the corresponding low energy effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath56 where @xmath8 is a projection operator onto the @xmath10 fermion subspace .",
    "typically , @xmath57 can be written as a sum @xmath58 where the @xmath33 are hopping operators .",
    "we expect that the @xmath33 are local in the underlying spin degrees of freedom .",

    "] we would like to point out that the lattice on which the fermion hops ( labeled @xmath42 ) may not be the same as the lattice formed by the local hilbert spaces ( labeled @xmath55 ) .",
    "now , consider the string - like product of hopping operators @xmath62 this operator destroys a fermion at site @xmath63 and creates one at site @xmath42 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are low - energy states with fermions at @xmath63 , @xmath42 , ( and possibly other fermions far away ) . furthermore",
    ", this operator clearly has a string - like structure : it is made up of a string - like product of operators , each of each is local in the underlying spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the only issue is that this string operator might be trivial .",
    "that is , @xmath67 might act trivially on all the intermediate spins at @xmath68 , and only have a nontrivial effect near @xmath42 and @xmath63 . in that case",
    ", @xmath67 is nt really a string at all .",
    "this is a legitimate concern , since the string operator typically is trivial in the case of _ bosonic _ quasi - particles .",
    "consider , for example , a lattice of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field : @xmath69 .",
    "the ground state has @xmath70 for all @xmath42 .",
    "the excitations are obtained by flipping one spin : @xmath71 for some @xmath59 .",
    "if we perturb the hamiltonian by a term @xmath72 , these excitations acquire dynamics .",
    "the corresponding hopping operators are then @xmath73 and the string operator is @xmath74 the operator @xmath67 clearly creates a particle at position @xmath42 and destroys one at position @xmath63 . however , as we see above , it is trivial and has no string - like structure .",
    "the particle creation and annihilation operators are completely local .",
    "our claim is that this can never happen in the case of emerging fermions .",
    "that is , the string operator @xmath67 can never be written as a product @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 are operators which act only within the local hilbert spaces near sites @xmath42 , @xmath63 .",
    "physically , this means that the fermion creation and annihilation operators are never local in the underlying bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "instead , they naturally appear in pairs , with a string - like structure connecting them . can not be written as a product @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the projection operator onto the @xmath10 fermion subspace with no particles at any of the intermediate sites @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are local operators commuting with @xmath8 .",
    "this statement is slightly stronger then the one made in the text , but the same proof applies . ]    _ proof : _ we wish to use the algebraic formula ( [ swap ] ) from the previous section .",
    "that formula relied on the locality of the hopping operators ( [ loc ] ) . here",
    "we would like to use a weaker locality condition : @xmath35 = 0 \\label{weakloc}\\ ] ] if @xmath42 , @xmath59 , _ are far _ from @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "one can make a similar argument using this weaker assumption .",
    "one arrives at a slightly weaker algebraic relation : @xmath84 if @xmath42 , @xmath83 , @xmath82 are sufficiently far from each other . since @xmath85",
    ", we can rewrite this as @xmath86    condition ( [ fermi ] ) is a direct consequence of the fermionic nature of the quasi - particles .",
    "we will now show that it implies that the strings are nontrivial .",
    "indeed , if the @xmath67 could be written as @xmath87 , then @xmath88 but the @xmath89 s and @xmath90 s are local operators , so they commute with each other when they are well separated .",
    "we can therefore rearrange the operators in these two equations to obtain @xmath91 this directly contradicts the fermion condition ( [ fermi ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the string operator is always nontrivial .",
    "@xmath92    the presence of this nontrivial string indicates that fermions always appear together with some kind of gauge field .",
    "one way to see this is to consider a closed loop of hopping operators @xmath93 .",
    "this string can be interpreted as a wilson loop operator , since its phase is precisely the accumulated phase of the particle when it traverses a loop .",
    "the fact that it is nontrivial ( that is , not equal to the identity operator ) means that the particle is coupled to a nontrivial gauge field .",
    "in this section , we present an exactly soluble lattice spin model with fermionic excitations .",
    "the exactly soluble model provides a concrete realization of the string picture discussed above .",
    "the emerging fermions turn out to be coupled to a @xmath94 gauge field .    in this spin-1/2 system , proposed by kitaev@xcite , the spins live on the _ links _ of a square lattice ( fig .",

    "@xmath100 are drawn as dotted diamonds , and are labeled with @xmath101 s or @xmath1 s according to whether the corresponding term in the hamiltonian involves @xmath102 s or @xmath103 s .",

    "the ground state satisfies @xmath104 for all sites @xmath55 , and @xmath105 for all plaquettes @xmath98 .",
    "there are two types of ( localized ) excited states .",
    "we can have a site where @xmath106 or we can have a plaquette where @xmath107 we call the first type of excitation a `` charge '' and the second type of excitation a `` flux . '' static charge and flux configurations are exact eigenstates of the above hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the charge and flux quasi - particles have no dynamics .",
    "this lack of dynamics is a special feature of the above model .",
    "however , we are interested in the properties of a _ generic _ hamiltonian in the same quantum phase .",
    "thus , we need to perturb the system , and analyze the resulting dynamics .",
    "the simplest nontrivial perturbation is @xmath108 it s not hard to see that the first term allows the fluxes to hop from plaquettes to adjacent plaquettes , while the second term allows the charges to hop from sites to neighboring sites .",
    "we now calculate the statistics of the fluxes . to do this ,",
    "we restrict our hamiltonian to the low energy subspace with @xmath10 fluxes and zero charges . within this subspace",
    ", our hamiltonian reduces to @xmath109    to make contact with our previous formalism , we write this as @xmath110 where the sum is taken over adjacent plaquettes , @xmath111 , @xmath112 is defined by @xmath113 , and @xmath96 the link joining @xmath98 and @xmath114 .    to calculate the statistics , we need to compare @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "well , it s obvious from the definition that all the hopping operators @xmath112 commute with one another .",
    "therefore , @xmath117 we conclude that the fluxes are bosons . in the same way",

    "next , we consider the bound state of a flux and a charge .",
    "that is , we consider excitations with a flux through some plaquette @xmath98 and also a charge at one of the sites @xmath97 adjacent to @xmath98 .    these bound states are not actually stable for the above hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) - the charge and flux will separate from one another over time .",
    "however , one can imagine modifying the hamiltonian so that charges and fluxes prefer to be adjacent to each other . in this case",
    ", the bound state is a true quasi - particle .",
    "suppose we ve made such a modification .",
    "we can then consider the statistics of the bound state .",
    "if we restrict our hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) to the low energy subspace with @xmath10 bound states , then our hamiltonian reduces to @xmath118 to understand the effect of these terms , imagine we have a bound state with a flux at @xmath98 and a charge at @xmath97 .",
    "it s not hard to see that the first term allows the flux to hop to the two neighboring plaquettes which are also adjacent to @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , the second term allows the charge to hop to the two neighboring sites , adjacent to @xmath98 .",
    "all other hopping destroys the bound state and is therefore forbidden for energetic reasons .",
    "thus , the perturbation gives rise to @xmath119 types of hopping operators - @xmath0 corresponding to fluxes and @xmath0 corresponding to charges .",
    "( see fig .",

    "any set of @xmath1 hopping operators involving @xmath127 must contain exactly @xmath0 which anti - commute .",
    "thus , exactly @xmath0 of @xmath128 anti - commute .",
    "this implies that    @xmath129    we conclude that the bound states are fermions . of course , this result is not that surprising once we notice that the charges and fluxes have relative statistics @xmath130 .",
    "we can easily check that the charges and fluxes have relative statistics @xmath16 .",
    "normally , we would just use the formula ( [ rel ] ) derived in the appendix .",
    "however , this relation assumes that the two types of particles both hop on the same lattice . in our case ,",
    "the charges hop on the square lattice , while the fluxes hop on the dual lattice .",
    "it s not hard to see that in our case the formula ( [ rel ] ) needs to be modified to @xmath131 where @xmath132 are neighboring sites , @xmath111 are neighboring plaquettes , and the links connecting @xmath132 , and @xmath111 are the same . from our previous calculations we know that @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 , @xmath135 anti - commute , and the relative statistics are @xmath130 .",
    "we now see why the two particles were called `` charges '' and `` fluxes '' - they have the same statistics and relative statistics as @xmath94 charges and fluxes .",
    "it turns out that this connection with @xmath94 gauge theory extends beyond the low energy regime - in fact , all the way to the lattice scale .",
    "one can show that the kitaev model is exactly equivalent to standard @xmath94 gauge theory coupled to a @xmath94 higgs field .",
    "we argued earlier that whenever fermions or anyons occur in a bosonic system , they are always created in pairs , and the pair creation operator has a string - like structure .",
    "the above exactly soluble model ( [ hkit ] ) provides a good example of this phenomenon .",
    "we begin with the charges .",
    "we can construct the string operators associated with these particles by taking products of their hopping operators along some path @xmath136 on the lattice .",
    "we find @xmath137 where @xmath138 are the links along the path ( see fig . [ string ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath139 is nontrivial - it acts non - trivially on the spin degrees of freedom along the string @xmath8 .",
    "it is also a pair creation operator : if we apply @xmath139 to the ground state , the resulting state is an exact eigenstate with two charges - one located at each endpoint of @xmath8 .",
    "one way to see this is to notice that @xmath139 commutes with everything in the hamiltonian except @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the string anti - commutes with these two operators , so when we apply it to the ground state , we get a state with two charges located at @xmath142 .",
    "the case of the flux quasi - particles is very similar .",
    "we take the product of the flux hopping operators along some path @xmath143 on the dual lattice .",
    "we find @xmath144 where @xmath138 are the links along the path ( see fig . [ string ] ) . just as before , one can show that the string @xmath145 is a creation operator which creates two fluxes at the endpoints of @xmath146 .",
    "finally , consider the case of the bound state of the charge and the flux .",
