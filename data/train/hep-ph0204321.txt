    "compton scattering provides a unique tool for studying hadronic structure .",
    "the compton amplitude probes the hadrons through a coupling of two electromagnetic currents and thus can be regarded as a generalization of hadron form factors . for the compton amplitude , when the initial photon is highly virtual but the final one is real , one arrives at the kinematics of deeply virtual compton scattering(dvcs ) . according to the quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) , the amplitudes at large momentum transfer factorize in the form of a convolution of a hard scattering amplitude which can be computed perturbatively from quark - gluon subprocesses multiplied by process - independent distribution amplitudes containing the bound - state nonperturbative dynamics for each of the interacting hadrons .",
    "thus , the most important contribution to dvcs amplitude is given by the convolution of a hard quark propagator and a nonperturbative function describing long - distance dynamics which is known as ",
    "generalized parton distributions(gpds ) \" and also known as ",
    "skewed parton distributions(spds ) \"  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been studied extensively in searching for possible new physics(see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gpds serve as a generalization of the ordinary ( forward ) parton distributions and provide much more direct and sensitive information on the light - front(lf ) wave function of a target hadron than the hadron form factors .",
    "in particular , the momentum of the  probed quark \" in gpds is not integrated over , but rather kept fixed at longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 , while for the form factor it is integrated out ( due to the nonlocal current operator @xmath1 for the gpds in contrast to the local vertex @xmath2 for the form factor ) .",
    "the form factors are then just moments of the gpds . at the expense of being generalized amplitudes ,",
    "the gpds always involve the nonvalence contributions due to the nature of longitudinal asymmetry @xmath3(so called  skewedness \" parameter ) between initial(@xmath4 ) and final(@xmath5 ) hadron state momenta .",
    "while the kinematic region where the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 of the probed quark is greater than the skewedness parameter @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath7 ) is called  dglap region\"@xcite , the rest of the longitudinal momentum region @xmath8 is called  erbl region\"@xcite .",
    "the dglap and erbl regions have also been denoted as the valence and nonvalence regions in the lf dynamics , respectively , because the parton - number - changing nonvalence fock - state contributions can not be avoided for @xmath8 while only the parton - number - conserving valence fock - state contributions are needed for @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it has been a great challenge to calculate the nonvalence contributions to the gpds in the framework of lf quantization .",
    "although many recent theoretical endeavors  @xcite have been made in describing the gpds in terms of lf wave functions , the task has not yet been satisfactory enough for practical calculations . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the nonvalence contributions to the gpds have been rewritten in terms of lf wave functions with different parton configurations . however , the representation given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite requires to find all the higher fock - state wave functions while there has been relatively little progress in computing the basic wave functions of hadrons from first principles . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the gpds were expressed in terms of lf wave function but only within toy models such as the t  hooft model of @xmath9-dimensional qcd  @xcite and the scalar wick - cutkosky model  @xcite , respectively .",
    "while these toy model analyses are helpful to gain some physical insight on the properties of the gpds ( especially , the time reversal invariance , the continuity at the crossover between the dglap and erbl regions , and the sum rule constrained by the electromagnetic form factor ) , the real @xmath10-dimensional qcd motivates us to come up with the more realistic model for the application to the analysis of gpds .",
    "in an effort toward this direction , we have presented an effective treatment of handling the nonvalence contributions to the gpds of the pion @xcite using our lf constituent quark model(lfqm ) , which has been phenomenologically quite successful in describing the spacelike form factors for the electromagnetic and radiative decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons  @xcite and the timelike weak form factors for exclusive semileptonic and rare decays of pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "our effective treatment of handling the nonvalence contributions is based on the covariant bethe - salpeter(bs ) approach formulated in the lf quantization@xcite which we call lfbs approach and has been previously applied to the exclusive semileptonic and rare decays of pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite providing reasonable results compared to the data .    however , an artifact of discontinuity at @xmath11 occured in our previous calculation of gpds@xcite .",
    "as we provided the reasoning@xcite , the discontinuity is caused by the different @xmath11 behavior between the gauge boson vertex and the hadronic vertex if the wave function for the gauge boson vertex is taken differently from that for the hadronic vertex .",
    "the similar observation was made recently in ref.@xcite using a different model(scalar wick - cutkosky model ) .",
    "such discontinuity at @xmath11 may cause a divergence in the dvcs amplitude .    in this work ,",
    "we improve our previous analysis@xcite by taking the same lfbs approach for both vertices of meson and gauge boson and explicitly show that our reasoning presented in ref.@xcite is correct ; i.e. the continuity of gpds at the crossover(@xmath11 ) is ensured by this consistent treatment of vertices .",
    "we also discuss the value of gpds at @xmath11 in conjunction with the single spin asymmetry ( ssa)@xcite and calculate the scattering amplitude contributing dominantly to the compton scattering of the pion in the deeply virtual region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the gpds as a nonperturbative formulation of the light - front dominated deeply virtual compton scattering(dvcs ) @xmath12 of the pion and introduce the necessary kinematics following the notation employed by radyushkin  @xcite . in section iii , we discuss the lfbs approach and present the consistent treatment of the gauge boson and hadron vertex functions in handling the nonvalence contributions to the gpds .",
    "the implication of the vector meson dominance(vmd ) at the gauge boson vertex in this improved analysis and the gpd value at @xmath11 are also discussed . in section iv",
    ", we show our numerical results for the gpds of the pion that satisfy the continuity at the crossover and in turn give the finite scattering amplitude for dvcs of the pion .",
    "the frame - independence of our model is checked by the sum rule between the gpds and the pion form factor .",
    "we also comment on the polynomiality conditions associated with the d - term contribution@xcite in erbl region .",
    "conclusions follow in section v.",
    "we begin with the kinematics of the virtual compton scattering ( see fig .  [ handbag ] ) of the pion [ vcs ] ^*(q ) + ( p ) ( q ) + ( p ) , where the initial ( final ) hadron state is characterized by the momentum @xmath13 and the incoming spacelike virtual and outgoing real photon momenta by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "[ handbag ] , the parton emitted by the pion has the momentum @xmath28 , and the one absorbed has the momentum @xmath29 .",
    "as in the case of spacelike form factors , we choose a frame where the incident spacelike photon carries @xmath30 : @xmath31 and @xmath32 $ ] .    in deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) where @xmath33 is large compared to the mass @xmath23 and @xmath34 , one obtains @xmath35",

    ", the allowed range of @xmath6 is given by [ range ] 0 ( -1 ) .    in the leading twist ignoring interactions at the quark - gauge boson(photon in this case ) vertex , the amplitude contributing dominantly to compton scattering in the deeply virtual region is given by    [ mmn ] m^=m^_s + m^_u , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the @xmath38- and @xmath39-channel amplitudes(see fig .",

    ". the @xmath45-channel amplitude can be easily obtained by @xmath46 .    in deeply virtual @xmath47 limit ,",
    "one obtains @xmath48 in the trace term of eq .",

    "although the continuity of gpds at @xmath11 is assured in our formulation presented in the last subsection ( section iii b ) , the value of @xmath162 vanishes in our model calculation as we shall see in our numerical results ( section iv ) .",
    "the reason why this occurs in our model calculation for the meson target is because the final state meson ( depicted in fig.[highfock](b ) and fig.[eff_photon ] ) shares the total longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath163 only between the two constituents so that , as @xmath164 ( _ i.e. _ the struck constituent loses its longitudinal momentum completely ) , the single spectator - constituent carries the total longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath163 and the final state two - body wavefunction at this kinematical point ( @xmath11 ) is zero .",
    "however , the situation is entirely different for the three - body wavefunction such as in the proton target because even at @xmath11 the two spectator - constituents can still share the total longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath163 between themselves and the final state three - body wavefunction does not vanish at @xmath11 . as discussed in the literature@xcite and mentioned in section",
    "ii , the value of gpds at @xmath11 is directly related to the ssa that can be measured in the scattering on an unpolarized target by the lepton polarized parallel or antiparallel to its direction .",
    "the recent measurements by hermes and clas collaborations showed that the ssa is indeed non - zero for the proton target and our observations based on the three - body wavefunction are not inconsistent with these experimental evidences for the non - zero gpds of proton at @xmath11 .    by the same reasoning ,",
    "if one includes the quark - antiquark - glue three - body state ( and any other multi - constituent - states ) beyond the ordinary two - body ( @xmath165 ) constituents in our model calculation , then it is in principle possible to get a non - zero @xmath166 . in the chiral - quark - soliton model@xcite",
    ", it is shown that @xmath166 is non - zero .",
    "thus , if the experiment on the pion is possible at all , then the ssa measurement would be crucial to discreminate different models and also find how much percentage of multi - constituent - component is necessary beyond our current @xmath165 state for the more realistic model construction",
    ". however , it is interesting to note that our current model calculation still satisfies the polynomiality conditions ( see eq.([sum - mom ] ) ) and our result on the isosinglet gpd of the pion is qualitatively very similar to the result obtained by the chiral - quark - soliton model satisfying the soft pion theorem , as we comment in the following section ( section iv ) .",

    "it is not surprising to see that @xmath140 becomes very large as @xmath68 , however , this does not cause a significant error in our calculation because the nonvalence contribution in the very small @xmath6 region is highly suppressed .",
    "also , a rather large fluctuation of black data for a rather large momentum transfer region @xmath175 gev@xmath174 ( even exhibiting a sign change near @xmath176 ) is neither unexpected nor troublesome because the nonvalence contribution is significantly suppressed in this large momentum transfer region where the gaussian wave function is also exponentially reduced . in order to check the reliability ( i.e. frame - independence ) of our constant @xmath140 approximation",

    "the dotted line represents the nonvalence contributions to the form factor for @xmath180 case , which increase ( decrease ) as @xmath6 gets larger ( smaller ) . also , there are @xmath181 values for nonzero @xmath6 due to @xmath25 ( see eq .",

    "[ sqd01 ] , the most dramatic change in our updated result of the pion gpds is that the solutions with the gaussian type gauge boson wave function show the continuity at the crossover(@xmath11 ) , while the solutions with the monopole type@xcite gauge boson wave function show discontinuity at the crossover . as we discussed before , such discontinuity at @xmath11 with the monopole type gauge boson wave function is just an artifact due to the different @xmath188 behavior between the gauge boson vertex ( @xmath103 ) and the hadronic vertex ( @xmath189 functions ( see eq.([wfi ] ) ) .",
    "this discontinuity problem of the gpds appeared in our previous analysis  @xcite is now resolved by realizing that the same type of bound state wave function should be used for both hadron and gauge boson .",
    "furthermore , we can obtain finite results for the scattering amplitudes for the dvcs region given by eq .",

    "thus , we do not show those figures in duplication but have confirmed that the polynomiality conditions are satisfied in our current model and our result on the isosinglet gpd of the pion is qualitatively very similar to the result ( fig.5 of ref.@xcite ) obtained by the chiral - quark - soliton model including the d - term in the erbl region .",
    "the d - term generates the highest power in the polynomial , _",
    "e.g. _ the second moment of the pion isosinglet gpd is given by @xmath193 , where @xmath194 in the chiral limit@xcite in ref.@xcite is related to @xmath6 by @xmath195 .",

    "it leads us to have a vector meson dominance picture at the gauge boson vertex within our constant approximation of @xmath140 in eq .",
