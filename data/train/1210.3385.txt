    "a common model@xcite of teaching considers the student as an apprentice learning from a master , the teacher .",
    "this model seems particularly apt in discussions of post - secondary education .",
    "it is essentially exactly right when discussing graduate students and still seems reasonable when the students are juniors and seniors taking major classes .",
    "this model is not so clearly extendable to introductory classes because many of the students are not aiming at eventual expertise in physics but , instead , are aiming at other expertise such as in engineering , biology , etc .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper i will use this model of post - secondary education to frame the discussion of the results of a trial comparing different ways of organizing the material in a physics class .",
    "one reason for using the apprentice - master model of teaching in this paper is that psychologists@xcite have studied and compared the thinking processes of experts and of novices in various fields of study ( including physics@xcite ) and have developed ideas on what distinguishes these two kinds of thinker .",
    "although the expert knows many more facts than the novice , the more important distinction between expert and novice is that these facts are organized in the mind of the expert into patterns that are hierarchical . for physics",
    "the lowest level of this heirarchy includes all of the specific detailed physical processes and situations that one remembers ( or can construct ) and the highest level includes the main overarching models that physicists use to give both qualitative and quantitative explanations of physical processes .",
    "this expert cognitive structure allows@xcite an expert physicist to `` see '' a physical situation differently than a novice ( understand the important features of the physical situation ) , analyze the physical situation differently ( more effectively use qualitative thinking ) , and so solve problems more efficiently .",
    "a student needs to learn the overarching models ( i.e. construct the higher levels of the mental framework of an expert ) as well as learn to connect them to specific phenomena that are new to the student . for the intro - physics classes discussed in this paper ,",
    "the overarching models include galilean relativity , newtonian mechanics , conservation of energy , conservation of momentum , and conservation of angular momentum .",
    "a student initially learns the meaning of these ideas by seeing the words and equations defined and used in discussions of various physical phenomena and then strengthens their understanding through practice in qualitative and quantitative analysis of either simple or complex physical situations .",
    "examination of the `` difficult '' problems in almost any standard introductory - physics textbook suggests that physicists especially prize a student s ability to analyze a complicated physical situation using one or more of these overarching physical models to derive a quantitative result .",
    "this ability is thus , apparently , one of the distinguishing abilities of an expert in the field .",
    "the question addressed in this paper is `` can we change the normal order of presentation of material in way that leads to increased student proficiency in the understanding that physicists prize ? '' . in the last 30 years research in the field of physics education",
    "has shown@xcite that standard lectures , problem solving , and performing standard laboratory experiments do not lead to excellent student understanding of the highest level of ideas in the hierarchical mental structure of an expert physicist .",
    "this research has also shown@xcite how to dramatically increase that understanding of the highest hierarchical level , largely by devoting classtime specifically to student - student discussions of these ideas so that students can work very directly toward building an expert conception of the ideas .",
    "this research also generally shows@xcite that , even with an increased understanding of the ideas in the highest level of the expert s mental hierarchy , students _ usually do not perform better _ on the standard problems that physicists prize . that is the puzzle that is addressed by this study .",
    "finally , though there are many excellent discussions@xcite of which types of problems a student should be practicing in order to make the best progress toward expert physicist , this paper is agnostic as to this question .",
    "rather , in measuring problem - solving ability , this paper uses what might be termed standard exam problems graded in the standard way .",
    "uc davis offered four lecture sections , sections i through iv , of physics 9a ( classical mechanics ) in the spring quarter of 2012 .",
    "a student in physics 9a has three hours of lecture , one hour of discussion section , and 2.5 hours of laboratory each week .",
    "the textbook and the laboratory experiments of all four sections were exactly the same but the lectures , discussion sections , and homework are under the control of the instructor assigned to teach that section .",
    "the material in section i ( the treatment group ) was organized so that students worked to learn the classical ideas connecting forces and motion ( mostly newtonian mechanics of pointlike objects and/or rigid bodies ) over the first 6 weeks of the 10 week quarter and then used the final 4 weeks to apply those principles to solve the algebraically complicated physical problems that physicist prize .",
    "the other three sections ( control groups ) learned ideas at the same time as calculations over the entire 10 weeks of the quarter .",
    "sections i and ii were both taught by the author and had identical homework problems , discussion section problems , lab problems , and lecture questions .",
    "sections iii and iv were taught by two other instructors who each had more than 20 years of experience teaching at uc davis , were excellent teachers , and had taught this specific course several times in the past few years .",
    "the students had no knowledge of how any of the sections would be taught when they enrolled .",
    "in addition , each class was completely full and almost no students could switch sections after they heard how the class would be taught , so this is a rough approximation of a randomized trial .",
    "the average student demographics at the beginning of the quarter are shown in table [ enteringdemographics ] ( the errors shown are standard error in the mean ) .",
    "fci refers to the force concept inventory@xcite which is a 30-question multiple - choice survey of the student s understanding of forces , motion , and their newtonian relationship .",
    "this survey was given to all students at the beginning of the quarter ( pretest ) and again ( posttest ) in the 8th week of the 10-week quarter at least 3 weeks after every section had finished working on the newtonian physics of point - like objects .",
    "we take the fci pretest to be a measure of the initial newtonian understandings that the students bring to the class .",
    "the student s gpa is their uc davis gpa at the beginning of the quarter and we take this to be a measure of their general academic ability . `` semesters physics '' refers to the number of semesters of previous physics classroom experience and was self - reported by the students .",
    "each of the sections had 15 - 20 more students who did nt take the fci pretest and so are not included in the table or in later analysis .",
    "an anova analysis shows that fci pretest distributions for the four sections were statistically indistinguishable but that section iii has an incoming gpa distribution that is distinctly different from the other three lectures .",
    "section iii also has a large number , 25 , of students who were enrolled in special extra - physics - help courses ( only 1 such student was in section ii and 4 each in sections i and iv ) and a slightly different female fraction . due to these differences in the student population in section iii , we leave section iii out of the quantitative analysis from now on but note that our various conclusions would either be unchanged or strengthened if section iii were included .",
    ".[enteringdemographics]student demographics upon entering the class .",
    "quoted errors are standard error of the mean . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this paper presented some results that are standard , in that they had been seen by many researchers , as well as the first report of a controlled study showing a new result .",
    "the fact that the final exam scores of sections ii and iv are indistinguishable from each other even though the fci posttest scores differ at the 99.9% confidence level is a result that is often seen in physics education research .",
    "learning the overarching ideas that make up the highest level of an expert s knowledge hierarchy seems to require special curricular focus on those ideas and some kind of interactive engagement by the students with the ideas ( to our knowledge there is no evidence of this size conceptual learning gain in a class without explicit curricular focus on interactive engagement ) .",
    "however , in the past , learning those ideas has generally not been shown to change exam scores when the exam problems are the standard problems that physicists prize .",
    "this paper presents the first controlled parallel study whose results are consistent with significantly increased exam scores on these standard problems .",
    "the result of this study suggests that students are better problem solvers if they have spent considerable time at the beginning of the quarter ( or semester ) on qualitative thinking before progressing to more computationally complicated problems later in the quarter .",
    "we should note that there are glimpses of this general kind of result in education literature@xcite .",
    "almost every physics class includes important overarching ( largely qualitative ) ideas and and computationally complicated applications of those ideas so the curricular materials in almost any physics class could be organized in roughly the same way as the treatment group discussed in this paper .",

    "grading studies we have done suggest systematic grading differences of at most about 2 points in the 80-point total if the graders do not talk to each other so we suggest a conservative estimate of 1 point possible systematic error for graders who are collaborating .",
    "errors of this size will change our numbers slightly but does not seriously affect the statistical signifigance that we quote ."
