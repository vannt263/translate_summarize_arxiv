    "recall that a hyperbolic manifold is a quotient of hyperbolic space @xmath14 by a torsion - free discrete subgroup of the lie group , @xmath15 , self - isometries of @xmath14 .",

    ". then since it is a closed subgroup of a lie group , it contains a one - parameter subgroup @xmath24 . since @xmath25 is cofinite , its limit set in the ideal boundary of @xmath14 is dense .",
    "it follows that the group generated by the conjugates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , act transitively on @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , @xmath23 acts transitively and so @xmath22 is constant .    if @xmath16 is an eigenfunction of the laplacian that vanishes on a totally geodesic hypersurface @xmath28 , then the reflection @xmath29 about @xmath3 belongs to @xmath23 .",
    "this is a well - known variant of the schwarz reflection principle .",
    "here is a sketch of the proof : since the laplacian commutes with the action by isometries , the function @xmath30 is an eigenfunction of @xmath31 with the same eigenvalue .",
    "define @xmath32 by setting @xmath33 equal to @xmath22 on one component of @xmath34 and equal to @xmath35 on the other component . because both @xmath22 and @xmath35 vanish on @xmath3 , the function @xmath33 belongs to the first sobolev space and @xmath33 is a weak solution to the laplace eigenvalue problem . a well - known argument using elliptic regularity",
    "gives that @xmath33 is a strong solution .",
    "but @xmath22 and @xmath33 agree on an open set and hence @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "finally , we consider the dependence of @xmath45 on the volume of @xmath0 when @xmath58 is finite . by a result of gelander @xcite , there is a constant @xmath60 such that for each discrete subgroup @xmath61 the number of generators of @xmath62 is at most @xmath63 . in particular , since @xmath62 has at least one generator , the covolume of @xmath62 is at least @xmath64 .    if @xmath58 is finite , then @xmath65 , and the group @xmath56 is generated by at most @xmath66 elements .",

    "if an endpoint does lie at the end of a cusp , then it enters @xmath7 and if both endpoints lie in the closure of horoballs , they lie in distinct horoballs , and hence must enter @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that @xmath72 is an infinite sequence of distinct totally geodesic immersed hypersurfaces with @xmath73 for each @xmath67 .",
    "since each @xmath72 intersects @xmath7 , there exists an orthonormal frame @xmath74 above some point in @xmath7 such that the first @xmath75 vectors in the frame belong to @xmath76 .",

    "let @xmath110 denote the maximal cardinality of a collection of disjoint , nonparallel , essential , nonperipheral simple closed curves on @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , @xmath110 is the number of curves needed to divide @xmath0 into pairs of pants . if @xmath0 is an @xmath111 times punctured genus @xmath112 surface , then @xmath113 .",
    "[ lem : eulerbound ] let @xmath0 be a topological surface with @xmath114 .",

    "if a graph @xmath24 and a curve @xmath117 intersect transversally , then @xmath118 indeed , using an orientation of @xmath117 , one can map the new edges that lie in @xmath117 onto the set of intersection points @xmath119 .",
    "in particular , to each intersection point that was not a vertex in @xmath24 , there is at least one new edge .",
    "if an intersection point @xmath120 is not a vertex of @xmath24 , then @xmath120 bisects an edge of @xmath24 .",

    "therefore , the euler characteristic decreases by at least @xmath121 .",
    "we prove the claim by induction on the number of connected components of @xmath24 . if @xmath24 is connected , then an inductive argument using ( [ eqn : jump - down ] ) gives @xmath122 . thus , if @xmath123 , we have ( [ eqn : euler ] ) and if equality holds , then @xmath124 and hence @xmath0 is homeomorphic to either a once punctured torus or a four times punctured sphere .",
    "any closed curve with a self - intersection point has negative euler characteristic , and any two closed curves on these two surfaces must intersect at least once .",
    "thus , using induction on @xmath67 , equality implies that each closed curve in @xmath24 is simple .",
    "any essential nonperipheral simple closed curve divides these surfaces into pairs of pants .    if @xmath125 , then @xmath0 is homeomorphic to a pair of pants . in this case",
    ", each essential nonperipheral closed curve @xmath126 has at least one self - intersection and thus @xmath127 .",
    "an induction argument using ( [ eqn : jump - down ] ) then shows @xmath128 .",
    "suppose that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is connected .",
    "if @xmath130 consists of a simple closed curve , then @xmath131 lies in a connected component @xmath132 of @xmath133 . by the inductive hypothesis , we have @xmath134 .",
    "if equality holds , then by the inductive hypothesis subset @xmath135 of @xmath131 divides @xmath132 into pairs of pants , and therefore @xmath136 divides @xmath0 into pairs of pants .",
    "if @xmath130 is not a simple closed curve , then there exist disjoint subsurfaces @xmath137 and @xmath132 so that @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "thus , by the inductive hypothesis , @xmath140 .",
    "note that @xmath141 and so equality can not hold in this case .",
    "not every totally geodesic component of a nodal set is the fixed point set of a reflection isometry . to see this , we construct here a closed hyperbolic surface @xmath0 of genus two and an eigenfunction on @xmath0 such that vanishes on a closed geodesic with a point of self - intersection .",
    "because the self - intersection is transversal , it can not be the fixed point set of a reflection .",
    "let @xmath142 be a regular geodesic octagon in the hyperbolic plane such that the angle at each vertex is @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "see the figure below .        choose two geodesics that intersect orthogonally in the center of the octagon and that bisect opposing sides .",
    "these geodesics divide the octogon into four right - angled pentagons . for one of these pentagons solve the eigenvalue problem with dirichlet conditions on the interior geodesics and neumann conditions on the exterior geodesics .",
    "then extend to the other pentagons via schwarz reflection .",
    "because of the neumann conditions on the exterior sides , we may identifiy the oriented red sides together and the oriented green sides to obtain an eigenfunction on a pair of pants such that the eigenfunction vanishes on a closed geodesic with one intersection point . by doubling the surface",
    ", we obtain an eigenfunction on a genus two surface with the desired properties .",
    "one can also construct hyperbolic surfaces with simple closed geodesics that lie in the nodal set of an eigenfunction but that do not belong to the fixed point set of a reflective isometry .",
    "for example , let @xmath103 be a hyperbolic pair of pants with equal boundary lengths @xcite . solve the eigenvalue problem for the laplacian on @xmath103 with dirichlet conditions on one boundary component and neumann boundary conditions on the other two boundary components .",
    "glue four copies of @xmath103 together as indicated in the figure below .",
    "in particular , we use schwarz reflection to extend the eigenfunction on @xmath103 to the entire genus three surface .",
    "the eigenfunction vanishes on the simple geodesics colored red in the figure above .",
    "although in the examples above the closed geodesic is not the fixed point set of a reflection isometry , each surface does have a finite covering such that the lift of the geodesic is the fixed point set of a reflection .",
    "more generally , we have the following .    [",
    "prop : cover ] let @xmath0 be a hyperbolic manifold with finite volume . if @xmath22 is an eigenfunction that vanishes on an immersed totally geodesic hypersurface @xmath46 , then there exists a finite cover @xmath144 and a lift @xmath145 of @xmath3 such that @xmath145 is the fixed point set of a reflection isometry and the lift of @xmath22 to @xmath13 vanishes on @xmath145 .",

    "we have @xmath146 where @xmath1 is the reflection through a lift @xmath105 of @xmath3 to @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath25 is cofinite , the index @xmath147 $ ] is finite .",
    "hence the intersection @xmath148 has finite index in @xmath149 .",
    "we have @xmath150 and hence @xmath1 descends to a reflection isometry on @xmath151 whose fixed point set is @xmath152 . since @xmath43 vanishes on @xmath105 , the lift of @xmath22 to @xmath153 vanishes on @xmath152 .",
    "in the introduction we observed that if the isometry group of a compact riemannian manifold contains a one parameter subgroup @xmath7 , then @xmath2 may be infinite .",
    "recently , in @xcite it was proven that given @xmath154 and an isotopy class @xmath101 of a hypersurface in a compact topological manifold @xmath3 one can construct a riemannian metric @xmath112 on @xmath3 and an eigenfunction @xmath4 of the laplacian @xmath155 such that @xmath4 vanishes on @xmath111 disjoint hypersurfaces each belonging to the homotopy class @xmath101 .",
