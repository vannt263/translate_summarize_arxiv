    ", the set of all possible broken symmetries is determined by symmetry alone ; each is labeled by an allowed irreducible representation ( irrep ) of the symmetric normal state .",
    "when symmetry allows for higher dimensional irreps , unconventional phases that combine these representations are possible",
    ". some of these can spontaneously break time - reversal and/or spin rotation symmetry .",
    "examples include a @xmath6 superconductor in a tetragonal system , or the @xmath7-phase of helium-3 in a cubic crystal .",
    "the former breaks time - reversal , whereas the latter represents a phase with broken spin rotation symmetry , i.e. an example of dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling .    here ,",
    "we study systems with hexagonal symmetry where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 irreps are degenerate , forming a two - component irreducible representation .",
    "@xcite this allows for the possibility of @xmath4 superconductivity , which spontaneously breaks parity and time - reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite however , superconductivity is not the only prospect : hexagonal systems can also naturally allow for _ particle - hole _ condensates which combine @xmath2-wave representations .",
    "we find that when such a system preserves lattice translation symmetry , a @xmath4 particle - hole condensate known as the @xmath5 phase  @xcite can form : it is an electron nematic state in the spin channel that spontaneously breaks time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry . in this phase",
    ", spin orbit coupling is generated dynamically .",
    "@xcite conversely , when the particle - hole condensate breaks translation symmetry , a @xmath8 density wave phase can form .",
    "this can occur either in the spin singlet or triplet channel ,  @xcite and accompanies a conventional charge density wave phase .",
    "@xmath2-density wave states were first proposed in a different context , as candidates for the enigmatic pseudogap phase in the under - doped cuprate superconductors.@xcite    in this paper , we demonstrate the existence of both the @xmath3 density wave , and the @xmath5 phase on a triangular lattice .",
    "we show here that both phases are stablilized in the weak - coupling limit when the fermi surface is tuned to cross a van hove singularity .",
    "in such a regime , there is an instability to each of these phases allowing the use of an unrestricted hartree - fock treatment . although this fine tuning is required to access the instabilities in a controlled fashion , it is plausible that such phases survive away from the van hove filling in the experimentally relevant intermediate coupling regime .",
    "we also study the transition between the two phases as the degree of fermi surface nesting is altered . since both represent particle - hole condensates of higher relative angular momentum , they require longer range interactions in order to be stabilized over their zero angular momentum counterparts - namely ferromagnetism and spin density wave phases , respectively .",
    "@xcite since the considerations below are based solely on symmetry , these results are also appropriate on other hexagonal lattices such as the honeycomb and kagome , as has been confirmed by recent studies .",
    "@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the extended hubbard model used in our analysis , and describe how instabilities corresponding to different irreps of the triangular lattice are obtained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] we provide a mean field description of these phases , before obtaining exact expressions for the rpa susceptibilities in sec .  [ sec : analyst ] .",
    "these are used along with the hartree - fock variational results of sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] to discuss the various phases present in this model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lg ] we explain how landau - ginzburg theory justifies these mean field solutions , before discussing these results in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we consider spinful fermions hopping on a triangular lattice , with nearest and next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping strengths , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and repulsive on - site and nearest neighbor density - density interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density operator for electrons of spin @xmath13 , at site @xmath14 .",
    "we have used @xmath15 , where the dispersion is @xmath16   \\quad - 2t_2\\left [ \\cos{\\sqrt{3}k_y } + 2\\cos{(3k_x/2)}\\cos{(\\sqrt{3}k_y/2)}\\right ] $ ] .",
    "there is a logarithmic divergence in the density of states at the van hove filling of @xmath17 , which corresponds to @xmath18 filling when the second neighbor hopping is zero .",
    "when this is the case , the fermi surface is perfectly nested in three inequivalent directions as shown in fig.[fig : fermisurface ] .",
    "however this is not generic , and further neighbor hopping destroys the perfect nesting .",
    "the fourier transformed interaction can be written as @xmath19 which is attractive in the particle hole channel , with the nearest neighbor interaction suggesting instabilities in non - zero angular momentum channels .",
    "there is an implicit sum over @xmath20 here , with the identity @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the usual pauli matrices in spin space . from symmetry considerations",
    ", it follows that @xmath23 can be written as a sum of separable interactions in each of the distinct irreps of the normal state point group . these can be thought of as lattice analogs of landau parameters . for hexagonal systems with a @xmath24 point group ,",
    "this sum can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the explicit form of the @xmath27 or extended @xmath28-wave representation etc .",
    "the other irreducible representations present are @xmath29-wave , and the two doubly degenerate representations relate to @xmath2-wave and @xmath30-wave . for the @xmath31 correlations which are of interest here ,",
    "the explicit @xmath32 form factors are @xmath33 .",
    "for purely repulsive interactions , there is no superconducting instability to first - order in the interactions - _ i.e. _ at mean field level - since there are no negative eigenvalues of the interaction matrix .",
    "we therefore examine instabilities in the particle - hole channel towards the formation of phases with order parameters @xmath34 , where @xmath35 labels the irrep .",
    "having decomposed the interaction into separate irreps , we see that in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) the effective interaction will not mix different representations .",
    "the effective interaction in rpa , @xmath36 , will have the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the non - interacting susceptibilities , and the sum is over _ distinct _",
    "irreps @xmath35 as in eq .",
    "[ eq : sumirrep ] .",
    "the free susceptibility for each irrep diverges logarithmically at the van hove filling so the instabilities exist at infinitesimal bare coupling .",
    "the dominant instability is then determined by the irrep whose logarithm has the largest pre - factor .",
    "_ mean field hamiltonians_- when the fermi surface is perfectly nested , @xmath39 will be most divergent at the three inequivalent nesting vectors @xmath40 , and we expect density wave order .",
    "this order forms in all three directions simultaneously , expanding the unit cell to four sites in real space . a trial hamiltonian that allows for charge density waves ( cdw ) ,",
    "spin density waves ( sdw ) and @xmath2-density waves ( @xmath2dw ) in all three directions is @xmath41 there is a sum over the three vectors @xmath42 , with cdw s denoted by @xmath43 , sdw s by @xmath44 and @xmath2dw s by @xmath45 .",
    "the lattice forms of the @xmath2-wave irreps are @xmath46 , and we have allowed the @xmath2-density wave to be in either the @xmath47 singlet , or triplet ( @xmath48 ) channels . without loss of generality , we have chosen the sdw to be uniaxial , as was determined from a landau - ginzburg analysis in ref .  .",
    "while we can expect density wave order when there is perfect nesting , the generic scenario of finite second neighbor hopping destroys this condition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermisurface ] .",
    "we may therefore expect @xmath49 ( pomeranchuk ) orders to be favored beyond some critical value of @xmath10 .",
    "we will see that an @xmath50 pomeranchuk instability ( i.e. a nematic state ) becomes dominant for large enough @xmath51 and @xmath10 . while such instabilities can occur in the charge channel , there is the more exotic possibility of realizing a @xmath4 nematic phase in the spin channel .",
    "this is favored because it utilizes both irreps , thus gaining condensation energy .",
    "this so called @xmath5 phase has a trial hamiltonian of the form @xmath52 @xmath53 is the magnitude of the @xmath5 phase order parameter , while @xmath46 are the @xmath2-wave form factors as before . by diagonalizing this matrix , we see that the fermi surface splits into two parts , with the spin winding twice in momentum space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : winding ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates how spin orbit coupling has been generated _",
    "in order to determine the mean field phase diagram , we calculate the rpa susceptibilities for each of the phases outlined above . for a given irrep @xmath35 , the static susceptibility in the non interacting system",
    "is given by the expression @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the usual fermi function , and the integral runs over the first brillouin zone .",
    "since the zero temperature integral is dominated by the saddle points in the dispersion we can obtain analytic expressions for the nematic and density wave susceptibilities .",
    "we then explain how these connect to a numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "[ eq : suscepty ] at finite temperature .    for @xmath49 orders ,",

    "we set @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and so , the @xmath60 integral can be transformed into integrals over @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    , [ eq : did ] , [ eq : dw ] and [ eq : diddw ] .",

    "[ eq : zerotsus ] , we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "this shows the correct logarithmic divergence at the van hove filling of @xmath66 .",
    "note the van hove points disappear at @xmath67 when the @xmath68 point is no longer a saddle , so we restrict our analysis to the range of parameter range @xmath69 .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath2-wave pomeranchuk susceptibility , the six van hove points are no longer equivalent .",
    "when summed over the six saddle points , the extra factor in the integrand gives @xmath70 .",

    "[ eq : suscepty ] can be exactly rewritten as @xmath73 for the uniform density wave at any of the nesting vectors @xmath74 , a similar expansion in polar coordinates around each van hove point with a cutoff to ensure @xmath75 as dictated by the fermi function gives the result @xmath76 } \\,\\log{\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right ) } , \\label{eq : dw}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the angle between arcs of the fermi surface at the @xmath68 point , given by @xmath78 .",
    "this also has the requisite logarithmic divergence at the van hove filling , but with a different coefficient to the density of states .",
    "note that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 dw susceptibilities are no longer degenerate since the point group symmetry is broken by a finite ordering vector .",
    "this @xmath31 susceptibility is a matrix in general , and transforms as such under the point group symmetry .",
    "however , the trace of this matrix is the same for all three nesting directions , and explicit evaluation gives @xmath79 which represents the same relation between @xmath2-wave and @xmath28-wave susceptibilities as for @xmath49 orders .",
    "these analytic results at zero temperature provide valuable insight into the finite temperature values of the susceptibility . at finite temperatures",
    "the logarithmic divergences are tamed , but the susceptibilities are still peaked strongly at the van hove filling .",
    "a numerical evaluation shows that the trend in those peak values mirrors the trend of pre - factors in fig .",
    "[ fig : coefficients ] .",
    "we can therefore determine the dominant instabilities for a given set of parameters ( @xmath80 ) by using both the bare interaction strength for a given irrep ( @xmath81 ) , and the pre - factors of these diverging susceptibilities .",
    "the instability with the largest product of these factors has the highest transition temperature according to the generalized stoner criterion .    for the extended hubbard model we have considered here , the stoner criteria for the sdw and cdw phases",
    "are @xmath82 respectively , while for the @xmath2-density wave state we have @xmath83 thus , for small nearest neighbor interactions @xmath51 ( compared to on - site @xmath84 ) , a spin density wave develops at all three nesting vectors .",
    "however for @xmath85 , the cdw state in all three directions becomes dominant . despite the multidimensional @xmath31 representation",

    "at low values of @xmath86 , the uniform or zero angular momentum particle hole condensates dominate , while @xmath50 condensates are possible above a critical @xmath86 .",

    "[ eq : stoner1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : stoner2 ] , is a variety of phases in the plane of @xmath86 vs. @xmath10 .",
    "however , while the analytic results of this rpa analysis provide the dominant instabilities and the boundaries between them , they do not give the exact combination of order parameters in each phase .",
    "we must therefore use a hartree - fock variational approach to determine this combination .",
    "to supplement the rpa results , we numerically solve the hartree - fock variational equations by minimizing the free energy @xmath89 .",
    "the trial hamiltonian is a combination of eq .",
    "[ eq : htr1 ] and  [ eq : mfham ] , which allows for all possible order parameters , and all averages are taken with respect to the trial hamiltonian .",
    "we obtain a set of self consistency equations for all order parameters , and numerically iterate these equations until convergence is achieved .",
    "the result of this analysis along with the rpa results , is the schematic phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] . for small @xmath86 , and depending on the degree of nesting present ,",
    "the conventional sdw and ferromagnetic ( i.e. @xmath28-wave or @xmath90 orders ) are stable .",
    "however , higher angular momentum @xmath50 particle hole condensates are possible when longer range interactions are significant .",
    "there is however , a distinction between phases which preserve and break translation symmetry .",
    "when translation symmetry is broken , there is a real superposition of @xmath2dw s of the form @xmath91 , which coexist with the charge density wave .",
    "the cdw has equal magnitude for all three ordering vectors , while the @xmath2dw components transform as a vector .",
    "there is a first order transition into this mixed phase as temperature is lowered .",
    "conversely , when translation symmetry is preserved with @xmath51 significant compared to @xmath84 , the two irreps acquire a phase difference of @xmath92 thus breaking time - reversal and spin rotation symmetry and forming the @xmath5 phase .",
    "this transition is continuous as temperature is lowered . to provide further insight into these results",
    ", we can turn to a landau - ginzburg analysis .",
    "in order to understand why the nematic phase is @xmath4 , but the @xmath2dw contains a real superposition of irreps , we must look at the landau - ginzburg ( @xmath93 ) free energy expansions up to fourth order .    starting with the nematic phase ,",
    "our numerical calculations confirm that these transitions are continuous as a function of temperature , so we can safely truncate a @xmath93 free energy expansion at low order .",
    "the presence of a two component ( vector ) order parameter along with the @xmath24 symmetry , dictates that the expansion for the translation symmetry preserving order parameters must be of the form ,  @xcite @xmath94 up to fourth order , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the order parameter .",
    "the sign of the coefficient @xmath97 determines which combination of the order parameters is present ; for @xmath98 , the sum @xmath99 minimizes the free energy , whereas for @xmath100 either a @xmath1 or @xmath0 order results .",
    "these coefficients can be determined microscopically ,  @xcite and in a manner exactly analogous with superconductivity ,  @xcite we get @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a trace over four green functions .",
    "thus , a @xmath4 pomeranchuk state , i.e. the @xmath5-phase is favored at the transition .    on the other hand , when translation symmetry is broken , with cdw and @xmath2dw order parameters in three directions the @xmath93 free energy expansion is more complicated .",
    "we can separate the expansion into three parts which involve pure cdw , pure @xmath2dw and coupling terms : @xmath104 since there are order parameters in three directions , with @xmath105 , and twice any vector is the same as a reciprocal lattice vector i.e. ( @xmath106 ) , we have @xmath107 note that in general we expect the ( real ) order parameter to have the same magnitudethough not necessarily the same signin all three directions , so that both fourth order terms above can be written as one . because we have three ordering directions , a cubic invariant is allowed in the expansion resulting in a first order transition into the cdw phase ;",
    "this is indeed observed in the numerical hartree - fock results .",
    "since the @xmath2dw has a multidimensional representation , its order parameter is a vector and no cubic term is allowed .",
    "the invariant free energy up to fourth order is therefore @xmath108 as with the nematic case , the sign of @xmath109 determines whether there is a real or imaginary superposition of @xmath2dw components at each ordering vector . in the absence of a cdw ,",
    "this coefficient is positive so a @xmath4 density wave results ; this is exactly analogous to the @xmath110 orders .",
    "however , a non - zero cdw couples to a @xmath2dw bilinear in the form @xmath111 at lowest order .",
    "there are several higher order coupling terms which we have omitted . from the rpa susceptibilities and hartree - fock minimization",
    ", the cdw has a higher transition temperature than the @xmath2dw .",
    "thus the quadratic @xmath2dw term becomes @xmath112 , where the dots represent higher order terms in @xmath113 .",
    "provided @xmath113 is negative and sufficiently large , the coefficient of this quadratic term will immediately become negative , allowing the @xmath2dw to form . by a similar argument , there is a coupling of the form @xmath114 which changes the sign of @xmath109 , and results in a real superposition @xmath2dw s .",
    "we therefore see that these simple symmetry arguments justify the coexistence of a cdw and the real @xmath91 dw .",
    "we have shown on analytical footing how higher angular momentum particle hole condensates can be realized from models with extended interactions on hexagonally symmetric lattices .",
    "the symmetry protected degeneracy of the @xmath2-wave representations means that unconventional phases which combine both irreps can form , in a manner that is analogous to superconductivity .    the full phase diagram in the plane @xmath51 vs. @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] .",
    "this provides a unified view of the effects of longer range interactions as bandstructure effects are tuned .",
    "when the fermi surface is approximately perfectly nested , commensurate density wave order is dominant . for low values of @xmath51 , a uniaxial spin density wave forms in all three nesting vectors simultaneously .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , when longer range interactions dominate , a simple cdw phase emerges .",
    "however this immediately induces the higher angular momentum @xmath3 density wave .",
    "this can be either a singlet or triplet density wave ; the singlet state corresponds to a modulation of hopping strengths ( i.e. bond order ) , while the triplet states are accompanied by a goldstone boson due to the broken spin rotation symmetry .",
    "however , as the perfect nesting condition is weakened by finite @xmath10 , the @xmath49 orders are favored , with a crossover from @xmath90 ferromagnetism to an @xmath50 chiral nematic phase as the interaction strength is increased .",
    "the latter is the @xmath5 phase - a @xmath4 pomeranchuk instability which occurs in the spin channel .",
    "this is a metal with dynamically driven spin orbit coupling , i.e. one that spontaneously breaks time reversal and @xmath115 spin rotation symmetries .",
    "such pomeranchuk phases have been observed as same sub - lattice instabilities in recent frg studies of kagome lattices when very large extended interactions are present .",
    "@xcite while these results suggest that the @xmath5 phase may be present at intermediate coupling , we caution that results of perturbation theory can be unreliable when extrapolated to larger interactions .",
    "we also note that while at mean field level we find no instability towards superconductivity at the van hove filling , other studies have found the singlet pairing channel to be competitive as nesting is reduced upon moving away from the saddle point .",
    "@xcite    while we have considered here the particular case of hexagonal systems , it is likely that non - trivial particle hole condensates can occur in cubic lattices which allow for three dimensional @xmath116 representations .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that the @xmath5 phase , which makes use of each of the irreps in the spin channel will be the favored ground state at a pomeranchuk instability .",
