    "in @xcite kauffman defines an extension of classical knot diagrams to virtual knot diagrams , motivated by gauss codes on the one hand and knots in thickened surfaces on the other hand .",
    "several classical knot invariants can be generalized to the virtual theory without much effort , e.g. , the knot group and derived invariants such as the alexander polynomial , the bracket and jones polynomials , and vassiliev invariants ( which can be introduced in different ways , see @xcite and @xcite ) .    the present paper deals with a polynomial invariant that is derived from an invariant of links in thickened surfaces introduced by jaeger , kauffman , and saleur in @xcite .",
    "the determinant formulation of the polynomial immediately generalizes to virtual link diagrams .",
    "it is a laurent polynomial in two variables with integral coefficients that vanishes on the class of classical link diagrams but gives non - trivial information for diagrams that represent non - classical virtual links .",
    "especially , examples can be given that the invariant is sensitive with respect to changes of orientation of a virtual knot .",
    "furthermore , the polynomial fulfills a conway - type skein relation in one variable and thus it is denoted by the term conway polynomial .    in the same way as in the classical case ,",
    "the one - variable alexander polynomial of a virtual link can be derived from the virtual link group , but the skein - relation for ( a normalized version of ) the classical alexander polynomial can not be extended to the class of virtual links . therefore , this alexander polynomial is different from the conway polynomial mentioned above in a non - trivial way  in contrast to the classical case ( and certain generalizations to links 3-manifolds , see for example @xcite , theorem 5.2.11 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after , in section [ virtknots ] , a short introduction into the field has been given , the determinant formulation of the conway polynomial for virtual links is described in section [ invariant ] .",
    "some properties of the polynomial are deduced , especially , that the invariant fulfills a conway - type skein relation , and several example calculations are given .",
    "then , in section [ alex ] , the alexander invariants derived from the link group , namely , alexander matrix , alexander ideal , and alexander polynomial , are defined and it is shown that the alexander polynomial does not fulfill any linear skein relation",
    ". finally , in section [ conrem ] , general problems in extending certain invariants of classical links to the virtual category are described and the direction of further investigations is indicated .",
    "in classical knot theory , knots and links in 3-dimensional space are examined . as a main tool ,",
    "projections of such links to an appropriate plane are considered , namely , the so - called _ link diagrams _ ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of virtual knot theory is to consider link diagrams where an additional crossing type is allowed .",
    "thus , for an oriented diagram , there are three types of crossings : the classical positive or negative crossings and the virtual crossings ( see fig . [ crossings ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     since the changes of sign corresponding to reidemeister moves of type i are compensated by the factor @xmath0 in @xmath1 and since the definition of @xmath2 and @xmath3 does not depend on the virtual crossings of the diagram , the statement on @xmath4 follows immediately .",
    "@xmath5    a normalization of the polynomial @xmath1 using rotation numbers , as done in @xcite , is not possible in the case of virtual link diagrams because of reidemeister move i. but due to the change of the variable `` @xmath6 '' to `` @xmath7 '' in comparison with @xcite , at least the sign of the polynomial is determined .",
    "define the _ normalized polynomial _ @xmath8 as follows .",

    "@xmath5    since a skein relation as in theorem [ skeinrel ] is fulfilled , in the following @xmath1 and @xmath8 will be called _ conway polynomial _ and _ normalized conway polynomial _ , respectively .",
    "a more familiar version of the conway skein relation can be achieved by setting @xmath30 and defining @xmath31 .",

    "then the following skein relation holds : @xmath33    @xmath5    applying the skein relation of theorem [ skeinrel ] is , of course , very helpful for calculating the conway polynomial . for example , the virtual link depicted in fig .",
    "[ balance ] can immediately be seen to have vanishing conway polynomial since changing an arbitrary crossing in the diagram yields the diagram of a hopf link and cutting open the same crossing gives a diagram of the trivial knot . for the diagram that arises from changing the orientation of one link component",
    ", the corresponding skein tree has a branch that ends in a diagram with two virtual and two classical crossings which can not be simplified by any changes of the classical crossings .",
    "therefore , latter diagram has to be calculated by using the definition of the conway polynomial .    [ basis ]",
    "let @xmath13 be a virtual link diagram .",

    "@xmath5    by theorem [ basis ] , @xmath40 $ ] is an invariant of virtual links that is invariant with respect to changes of classical crossings , too .",
    "thus @xmath36 can give information to distinguish those `` basic links '' whose conway polynomials must be calculated by the determinant formulation instead of applying the skein relation , i.e. , generating elements of the virtual skein module related to the conway skein relation . for example , the value of @xmath36 for the non - trivial diagram at the leaf of the skein tree that has been mentioned in the previous remark is non - zero .",
    "therefore , the corresponding generating element is different from the trivial knot .    for a virtual link diagram @xmath13 ,",
    "let @xmath41 denote the _ mirror image _ of @xmath13 , i.e. , the diagram that arises from @xmath13 by changing the over - under information of every classical crossing .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath41 are equivalent then @xmath13 is called _ amphicheiral _ and otherwise _",
    "chiral_. furthermore , let @xmath42 be the _ inverse _ of @xmath13 , i.e. , the diagram with inverse orientation for every component of @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath42 are equivalent then @xmath13 is called _ invertible _ and otherwise _ non - invertible_.    in the case of classical links , it is known that kauffman and homfly polynomials , and therefore the conway polynomial too , are insensitive with respect to invertibility of a knot or link ( indeed , this is true for any invariant derived from quantum groups , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "in the same way as for classical links , the _ ( virtual ) link group _ can be defined via the wirtinger presentation of a virtual link diagram , i.e. , a group generator is assigned to each arc of the diagram and a group relation can be read off at each classical crossing corresponding to the rules shown in fig .",

    "the link group is an invariant of virtual links .",
    "the above definition of the link group is a purely combinatorial one and it has , in general , nothing to do with the complement of a link in 3-space as in classical knot theory . indeed , it can be shown that there exists a virtual knot group which is not the fundamental group of any 3-manifold . related work on virtual knot groups can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the _ alexander matrix _ corresponding to a group presentation can be calculated via a differential calculus . for a presentation with @xmath50 generators and @xmath51 relations ,",
    "it is a @xmath52 matrix with entries from the ring @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the _ ( first ) alexander ideal _ @xmath54 of a diagram @xmath13 is generated by the @xmath55 minors of the alexander matrix for the corresponding link group and the _ ( first ) alexander polynomial _ @xmath56",
    "$ ] is the greatest common divisor of @xmath54 .",
    "the alexander ideal is an invariant of virtual links and the alexander polynomial is an invariant up to sign and up to multiplication by powers of @xmath57 .    in @xcite alexander polynomials derived from an _ extended alexander group _ of a virtual link diagram",
    "are considered .",
    "indeed , the conway polynomial @xmath58 is related to the _ 0th virtual alexander polynomial _ of @xcite , see remark 4.2 therein .",
    "in contrast to the classical alexander polynomial , the alexander polynomial for virtual links does not fulfill any linear skein relation as stated in the next theorem .",
    "therefore it is crucially different from the conway polynomial defined in section [ invariant ] .",
    "[ noskein ] for any normalization @xmath59 of the polynomial @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 with some @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the equation @xmath64\\ ] ] has only the trivial solution @xmath65 .",
    "assume the above skein relation has a non - trivial solution .",
    "consider the skein triples @xmath66 where @xmath13 is a classical knot diagram with one crossing and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a standard diagram , with arbitrary orientations of the components , of the hopf link ( the latter triple corresponding to an arbitrary of the diagram s two crossings ) .",
    "then the related alexander polynomials have values , up to normalization , as follows .",
    "@xmath69 inserting these values , each multiplied by a factor @xmath70 , into the skein relation immediately shows that , up to normalization , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus the skein relation is equivalent to the classical alexander skein relation : @xmath73 finally , let @xmath74 be the virtual link diagram arising from @xmath68 by changing an arbitrary classical crossing to a virtual crossing",
    ". then @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "inserting these values , each multiplied by a factor @xmath77 , into the alexander skein relation yields a contradiction .",
    "@xmath5    the proof of theorem [ noskein ] shows that the classical alexander skein relation is , up to a factor , the unique one that holds for the alexander polynomial of classical links , and this skein relation can not be extended to the class of virtual links .    the virtual knot with diagram @xmath13 which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ notinv ] can not be distinguished from its inverse by alexander polynomials since the alexander ideals are identical : @xmath78    c    the virtual knot with trivial knot group and trivial jones polynomial investigated in @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ kaufex ] , has non - vanishing normalized conway polynomial @xmath79 and therefore it does not represent a classical knot .",
    "this is a result that could not be achieved with the means of @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the alexander - conway polynomial for links in thickened surfaces can be defined in the multivariable case as well and the construction analogously yields a multivariable conway polynomial for virtual links . also the multivariable alexander polynomial can be derived from the virtual link group and it is an invariant that is different from the conway polynomial as has been seen above for the one - variable case .",
    "it is quite natural to consider generalizations of homfly and kauffman polynomials to virtual links next .",
    "besides the definition of these polynomials via skein relations , there are several state models for them , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and also @xcite and citations therein .",
    "but , when trying to generalize any of these approaches , one meets with at least one of the following three obstacles .",
    "first , a virtual link diagram in general can not be unknotted by classical crossing changes .",
    "therefore it is necessary to find a basis for the virtual skein module corresponding to the homfly and kauffman skein relations , respectively , which is not yet known .",
    "secondly , some models make use of the signed graph corresponding to a black - and - white colouring of the plane , but it is not clear how to handle virtual crossings in a generalized model . and finally , state models mostly rely on rotation numbers which are not invariant with respect to reidemeister moves of type i.    it should be mentioned that missing invariance under reidemeister moves of type i and i is a more serious problem when defining virtual link invariants than missing invariance under reidemeister moves of type i when defining classical link invariants . for example , having in mind theorem [ noskein ] , it is not possible to derive a linear skein relation for the alexander polynomial from the virtual link group .",
    "the proof that is given by hartley @xcite for the classical case can not be extended to virtual link diagrams because it intrinsically uses a normalization of the alexander polynomial via rotation numbers during the proof .",
    "observe that in classical knot theory a result by b. trace @xcite assures that a regular isotopy invariant can always be made to an ambient isotopy invariant using writhe and rotation number of an oriented link diagram .    a more general class of invariants that may be generalized to virtual links",
    "are _ quantum link invariants_. in @xcite it is described how to define such invariants via @xmath80-matrices and the abstract tensor approach , see also @xcite .",
    "again , the invariance under reidemeister moves of types i and i causes difficulties and thus the virtual quantum link invariants under consideration are only invariant with respect to _ virtual regular isotopy _ ,",
    "i.e. , the two troublemaking moves are avoided .",
    "the conway polynomial for virtual links that has been introduced in the present paper also arises from a quantum link invariant ( see @xcite ) but it is not difficult to get control over its behaviour with respect to reidemeister moves of types i and i. it is left to further investigations which ( quantum link ) invariants have similar properties and can be extended to full invariants of virtual links .",
    "the author would like to thank saziye bayram for finding an error in a calculation , and dan silver for informing him about his results ."
