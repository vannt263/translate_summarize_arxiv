    "the a5v star @xmath1 pictoris ( hd 39060 = hr 2020 ) at a distance @xmath9 possesses a spectacular edge - on debris disk imaged in scattered light and thermal emission that extends to radii @xmath101400@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "an age of @xmath1212 myr has been estimated for for the central star based on the properties of late - type members of the @xmath1 pic moving group @xcite .",
    "the dust in this system is believed to be replenished from a reservoir , such as collisions between parent bodies or sublimation of comets because the estimated lifetime for the dust under radiation pressure , poynting - robertson drag , and grain - grain collisions is a few orders of magnitude shorter than the age of the system @xcite",
    ". there may be evidence for the presence of large bodies in the @xmath1 pictoris disk that perturb dust grains and parent bodies and instigate collisional cascades between them .",
    "a 5@xmath13 warp at radii @xmath480 au has been observed in scattered light using stis on _ hst _ and may be generated by either a brown dwarf close to the star ( at distances @xmath43 au ) or a 0.17@xmath14 planet at larger distances from the star ( 50@xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 pictoris disk may also possess infalling , sublimating , refractory bodies .",
    "time - variable , high velocity , non - periodic , red - shifted atomic absorption features have been observed toward @xmath1 pictoris at ultraviolet ( uv ) and visual wavelengths that vary on timescales as short as hours .",
    "the velocity of the atoms , typically 100400@xmath15 , is close to the free fall velocity at a few stellar radii , suggesting that the absorption is produced as stellar photons pass through the comae of infalling bodies at distances @xmath46@xmath11 from the star @xcite .",
    "the origin of the micron - sized dust grains required to account for the observed scattered light and thermal emission is currently not well - constrained . the broad 9.7@xmath2 silicate emission feature and",
    "the narrow 11.3@xmath2 crystalline olivine emission feature observed toward @xmath1 pictoris appear grossly similar to those observed toward comets halley , bradford 1987s , and levy 1990 xx @xcite , suggesting that the grains may be cometary .",
    "models of cometary grains , idealized as fluffy aggregates of interstellar silicate cores with carbonaceous organic refractory mantles ( and additional ice mantles at distances larger than the snow - line ) , in radiative equilibrium with the central star are able to reproduce the observed 10@xmath2 silicate feature and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at ir through millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "spatially - resolved studies of the silicate emission feature , obtained using comics on the subaru telescope , suggest that the shape of the 10@xmath2 feature changes as a function of position in the disk , with large and crystalline grains concentrated at the center and small grains located in ring - like bands at 6.4 , 16 , and 29@xmath11 from the central star @xcite .",
    "the rings of small grains may be explained by collisions between large orbiting bodies .",
    "high - resolution , mid - ir imaging of @xmath1 pictoris , obtained with trecs on the gemini south telescope , has resolved a prominent clump on the south - west side of the disk at 52@xmath11 from the central star which may also indicate that a recent collision has occured in the @xmath1 pictoris disk @xcite .    spatially resolved visual spectroscopy of @xmath1 pictoris has revealed a disk of atomic gas in keplerian rotation , observed via scattered emission from , , , , , , , , and .",
    "the atomic gas possesses a ne / sw brightness asymmetry and an inner warp similar to that observed in the dust disk although the gas extends to larger heights than the dust @xcite .",
    "estimates of the radiation pressure acting on fe and na atoms suggest that these species should be not be in keplerian rotation but should be accelerated to terminal outflow velocities @xmath12100s1000s km / sec @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a ring of neutral hydrogen at distance 0.5 au could slow down the radial flow of gas .",
    "however , @xcite have recently proposed that the gas will not be radially accelerated if the carbon is overabundant ; their model does not require a population of undetected atomic hydrogen .",
    "since carbon does not experience strong radiation pressure ( @xmath16 = @xmath17 @xmath18 0 ) and also has a large ionization fraction ( @xmath120.5 ) , they suggest that coulomb interactions between and other ions reduce the effective radiation pressure on the bulk gas . in this case , the ions and neutral atoms in the disk couple together into a fluid , with an effective radiation pressure coefficient , that is bound to the system and that brakes the gas if @xmath19 @xmath4 0.5 .",
    "in particular , they suggest that if the carbon abundance is @xmath1010@xmath20 solar , then all the atomic gas will be retained .",
    "measurements of the column density of the stable component of atomic carbon ( with zero velocity relative to the star ) via absorption from ( @xmath21p ) @xmath221613 @xcite and absorption from @xmath221036 and @xmath23 @xmath221037 superimposed on chromospheric @xmath221038 , suggest that the bulk of the atomic gas is composed of carbon with a c / fe abundance ratio that is 16 times the solar value and an ionization fraction of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "we report the results of a _ spitzer _",
    "irs study of the dust and gas around @xmath1 pictoris , building on the model for the composition and spatial distribution of the grains by @xcite and placing 3@xmath3 upper limits on the line emission from h@xmath6 s(2 ) , s(1 ) , s(0 ) and [ ] , , and gas .",
    "based upon the similarity in the spatial distribution of the dust and gas observed in scattered light , we hypothesize that the dust and gas in this system are physically associated and that the observed gas is secondary ; it has been produced from circumstellar material since the star formed . we quantitatively show that the observed , seen in keplerian rotation around the star , can be produced via photon - stimulated desorption in a time that is shorter than the residence time of the gas in the disk .",
    "we obtained ir spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite spectral mapping mode observations of @xmath1 pictoris using the short - low ( sl ; 5.214 @xmath2 ; @xmath24 ) , short - high ( sh ; 9.919.6 @xmath2 ; @xmath25 ) , and long - high ( lh ; 18.737.2 @xmath2 ; @xmath25 ) modules on the _ spitzer space telescope _",

    "both the low and high resolution observations were made with the spectrograph long slits aligned along the position angle of @xmath1 pictoris disk to within 5@xmath13 .    the sl2 ( aor key : 8972288 ) and sl1 ( aor key : 8972544 ) spectra were obtained on 16 november 2004 by stepping the slit in 7 and 11 1.8@xmath27 intervals perpendicular to the disk , respectively , with the center position centered on the disk .",

    "each sh and lh map position was observed using 25 and 24 cycles , respectively , of 30 and 14 second ramps .",
    "high accuracy peak - up , with the blue ( 13.318.7@xmath2 ) array , on the nearby star hd 38891 ( located 12@xmath28 north of @xmath1 pictoris ) , was used to center the disk in the sl2 , sl1 , and sh slits ; high accuracy peak - up , with the red array ( 18.526@xmath2 ) , on hd 38891 was used to center the disk in the lh slit .",
    "the raw data were processed into calibrated ( flat - fielded , stray light corrected ) 2-dimensional spectra with version s11.0.2 of the ssc pipeline .",
    "we removed masked and rogue pixels from the basic calibrated data by interpolating between their nearest neighbors , coadded the resulting images , and extracted 1-dimensional spectra using the irs team s smart program @xcite .",
    "since separate nod observations of the sky were not made when @xmath1 pictoris was observed , we approximated the sl sky background as a constant at each wavelength and subtracted this value from each pixel in the spatial direction across the source .",
    "since the sl slits are long enough to sample the psf in the spatial direction , we fit 1-dimensional gaussians to the sl spectra in the spatial direction to determine the positions of the source in the slits .",
    "we extracted our low resolution spectra by summing over a window whose width varied as a function of wavelength to account for the changing size of the point spread function and was centered on the source position .",
    "finally , we multiplied the resulting spectra with an @xmath29 lac relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) , obtained by dividing an @xmath29 lac template spectrum with an observed @xmath29 lac sl spectrum @xcite .",
    "since point sources fill the high resolution slits , we extracted our high resolution spectra ( without background subtraction ) by summing over all of the pixels in the sh and lh slits .",
    "the extracted high resolution spectra were multiplied by a @xmath30 dra high resolution rsrf .",
    "we constructed a spectrum that is consistent with the lh slit , the largest slit we used to observe @xmath1 pictoris , centered on the disk . since the source is extended in our irs observations , we added multiple sl measurements together to construct an aperture equal to the lh aperture .",
    "since our sh map was not large enough to cover the lh central slit position , we scaled our sh spectrum by a factor of 1.068 to match the sl and lh spectra , using the ll spectrum at 5.1939 @xmath0 m to 9.9232 @xmath0 m , the sh spectrum at 9.9461 @xmath0 m to 19.3179 @xmath0 m , and the lh spectrum at 19.2636 @xmath0 m to 35.9892 @xmath0 m .",
    "the final spectrum of @xmath1 pic ( shown in figure [ fig : sedobs ] ) is that of a 11@xmath27@xmath2022@xmath27 region centered on the star and oriented along the disk .",
    "the signal : noise in our spectrum is very high . over spans of many spectral resolution elements , the sensitivity of our spectrum is limited by flat - fielding errors to 1 - 2% of the continuum flux density . over smaller spans , @xmath31 10 spectral resolution elements or so , the sensitivity is limited only by photon noise from the background and target , and is significantly better : 0.1 - 0.5% of the continuum flux density in sh and lh , and 0.05 - 0.2% in sl , consistent with the point - to - point scatter in the spectrum over such small spans , and ( perforce ) consistent with the _ spitzer_-irs facility sensitivity tool , spec - pet .",
    "thus , every spectral feature visible in our @xmath1 pic spectrum that is at least as wide as the spectral resolution is real , and the upper limits on weaker spectral lines are significantly smaller than 1% of the continuum .",
    "for simplicity we have calculated such upper limits directly from the point - to - point variation of the continuum - subtracted spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : sedobs ] plots the 5.236@xmath2 irs spectrum and the phoenix model stellar atmospheric spectrum with effective temperature @xmath32 and surface gravity log@xmath33 = 4.2 .",
    "figure [ fig : sedobs ] clearly shows that the dust excess emission above the stellar atmospheric radiation is even seen at wavelengths as short as @xmath3458@xmath2 , indicating that there may exist a population of hot dust ( @xmath12400600@xmath8 ) at a distance of @xmath410@xmath11 from the central star [ see figure 1 of @xcite ] .",
    "mostly prominent in figure [ fig : sedobs ] are the broad 10@xmath2 feature ( which reveals the presence of both amorphous silicates and crystalline silicates in the @xmath1 pictoris disk ) , and the 28@xmath2 and 33.5@xmath2 crystalline olivine emission features ( see the inset in figure [ fig : sedobs]a ) which closely resemble the @xcite model spectrum ( see their figure 6c).fe@xmath35sio@xmath36 grains also have a rich set of features in the mid - ir .",
    "but their peak wavelengths and relative feature strengths are inconsistent with the irs spectrum ( e.g. see chihara et al .",

    "we adopt the refractive indices of mg@xmath42fe@xmath43sio@xmath39 ( mukai & koike 1990 ) .",
    "although in principle it is possible to infer the mg : fe ratio from the locations and strengths of the ir features ( e.g. see koike et al .",
    "1993 , 2003 , fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) , neither the irs spectrum reported here reveals a large number of crystalline silicate features nor does it cover a sufficiently broad wavelength range for constraining the exact crystal composition . as shown in figure 2 , the dust model consisting of crystalline mg@xmath42fe@xmath43sio@xmath39 olivine reproduces the ir features reasonably well .",
    "] this is the first time that the silicate bands at wavelengths longer than 10@xmath2 have ever been detected in the @xmath1 pictoris disk .    for comparison",
    ", we also show in figure [ fig : sedobs ] the iras broadband photometry of @xcite , the photometry of @xcite at 8.8 , 10.3 , 11.7 and 12.5@xmath2 obtained using the _ big mac _ spectral filters at the nasa _ infrared telescope facility _ ( irtf ) , the irtf @xmath44 band ( 10.1@xmath2 ) and @xmath45 band ( 20@xmath2 ) photometry of @xcite , the irtf 2.613.5@xmath2 intermediate resolution ( @xmath46 ) spectrometry of @xcite , and the _ kuiper airborne observatory _ ( kao ) 47 and 95@xmath2 photometry of @xcite .",
    "while the photometry of @xcite and the irtf @xmath44 band photometry of @xcite agree with the spectrometry of @xcite very well , they are below the irs spectrum by a factor of @xmath121.94 ( see figure [ fig : sedobs]b and figure [ fig : sedmod]b ) .",
    "this difference is much larger than the calibration uncertainty of irs and is attributed to the fact that the spitzer apertures ( @xmath47 for sl , @xmath48 for sh , @xmath49 for lh ) are much larger than the apertures of ground - based observations [ e.g. @xmath50 diameter of @xcite , @xmath51 of @xcite , @xmath52 diameter of @xcite ] , and therefore spitzer detects more flux from extended material than in previous observations.3.6@xmath53 , approximately the same as @xcite s spectroscopic observation ) is close to that of @xcite . ]    the nature ( e.g. size , composition , and morphology ) of the dust and its spatial distribution in protoplanetary and debris disks is mostly revealed through the interaction of the dust with the electromagnetic radiation of the central star : absorbing , scattering and polarizing the stellar radiation and re - radiating the absorbed uv / visible photons at longer wavelengths , ranging from the ir to submillimeter and millimeter . since the disk around @xmath1 pictoris subtends more than 100@xmath27 , it has been studied in great detail",

    "it is found that , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we are able to obtain a reasonably good fit to the overall sed and the spitzer irs spectrum including the silicate emission features at 10 , 28 and 33.5@xmath2 ( see figure [ fig : sedmod ] ) . )",

    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the oversimplification of the assumed dust spatial distribution is also reflected by the model - predicted ir emission from the dust within a 3.6@xmath53 diameter ( corresponding to @xmath1235@xmath11 ; see figure 2a ) : the model - predicted emission from the inner 35@xmath11 region accounts for almost all the observed @xmath22@xmath415@xmath2 emission for the entire disk .",
    "although this is consistent with the previous spatially resolved mid - ir spectroscopy which show that 10@xmath2 silicate emission originates from the inner @xmath1220@xmath11 @xcite , it appears to contradict the irs detection of an appreciable amount of silicate emission from the outer @xmath1235@xmath11 ( see figure 1a ) . this will be investigated in detail in a subsequent paper ( see a. li et al .  2007 , in preparation ) .",

    ", we actually have only 2 free parameters @xmath29 and @xmath74 left ( see  3 for details ) . in so doing , 2 assumptions have been made : ( 1 ) all grains have the same spatial distribution ; and ( 2 ) the grains producing the irs emission spectrum are also responsible for the optical scattered light or their spatial distribution follows that of the dust responsible for the optical scattered light . admittedly , the former assumption is oversimplified since the response of the grains to the stellar radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag varies with grain size and therefore the simple radial power law is probably not all that representative of the actual grain distribution uniformly with size . to justify the latter assumption , a simultaneous modeling of both the scattered light and ir emission is required .",
    "nevertheless , the general conclusion for the dust ( the presence of crystalline silicates and an inner warm dust component in the disk ) remains valid .",
    "we have presented a model for the production of circumstellar sodium gas around @xmath1 pictoris from dust via photon - stimulated desorption .",

    "our estimate for the time required to desorb the observed sodium is a function of ( 1 ) the circumstellar grain temperature , ( 2 ) the circumstellar gas temperature , and ( 3 ) the gas carbon : sodium abundance ratio .",
    "the photon - stimulated desorption rate of sodium from orbiting dust grains is dependent on the grain temperature with sodium more efficiently desorbed from warmer surfaces .",

    "we also consider how changes in the gas temperature profile affect our estimates for the sodium neutral fraction and therefore the total number of sodium atoms in the disk",
    ". the estimated neutral fraction of sodium is weakly dependent on the gas temperature and composition .",
    "the radiative recombination coefficients for carbon and sodium decrease by factors of @xmath125 if the gas temperature increases from 10 k to 100 k or 100 k to 1000 k. if the gas has a temperature profile similar to small grains or black bodies ( instead of 1 @xmath0 m olivine spheres ) , then we estimate that the @xmath1 pictoris disk possesses either 7.0@xmath2010@xmath117 or 5.4@xmath2010@xmath117 sodium atoms , respectively , similar to the 4.6@xmath2010@xmath117 sodium atoms expected if the gas has the temperature profile expected from 1 @xmath0 m amorphous silicate grains .",
    "the assumed abundance of sodium relative to carbon also affects the total number of sodium atoms inferred from the neutral sodium observations . in our model , we have assumed that the gas has a solar composition ; however , a recent inventory of the circumstellar atomic gas around @xmath1 pictoris suggests that carbon is enriched compared to iron and oxygen by factors of 16 and 18 , respectively @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath1 pictoris disk is enriched in carbon relative to sodium by a factor of 16 , then the disk possesses 1.7@xmath2010@xmath117 sodium atoms , somewhat less than the number inferred if the gas has a solar composition .",

    "no h@xmath6 , [ ] , , or emission is detected .",
    "our 3@xmath3 upper limits suggest that @xmath417@xmath5 h@xmath6 remains in the disk significantly less than the previously reported detections of h@xmath6 s(1 ) and s(0 ) emission .",
    "the circumstellar disk around @xmath1 pictoris has too little gas to support the formation of giant planets .",
    "some of the observed resonantly scattered , observed at visual wavelengths , may be produced via photon - stimulated desorption ; the timescale to generate all of the inferred circumstellar sodium is 13000 yr , approximately the residence time of the gas in the disk if the gas is braked by coulomb forces .",

    "<S> we have obtained _ spitzer _ irs 5.535 @xmath0 m spectroscopy of the debris disk around @xmath1 pictoris . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the 10@xmath2 silicate emission feature originally observed from the ground , we also detect the crystalline silicate emission bands at 28@xmath2 and 33.5@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that the silicate bands at wavelengths longer than 10@xmath2 have ever been seen in the @xmath1 pictoris disk . </S>",
    "<S> the observed dust emission is well reproduced by a dust model consisting of fluffy cometary and crystalline olivine aggregates . </S>",
    "<S> we searched for line emission from molecular hydrogen and atomic [ ] , , and gas but detected none . </S>",
    "<S> we place a 3@xmath3 upper limit of @xmath417@xmath5 on the h@xmath6 s(1 ) gas mass , assuming an excitation temperature of @xmath7=100@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there is less gas in this system than is required to form the envelope of jupiter . </S>",
    "<S> we hypothesize that some of the atomic gas observed in keplerian rotation around @xmath1 pictoris may be produced by photon - stimulated desorption from circumstellar dust grains . </S>"
