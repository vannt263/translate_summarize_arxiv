    "according to theoretical considerations , a  field - effect transistor ( fet ) can act as a detector of the electromagnetic radiation@xcite . depending on material parameters , the length of the channel and the electron scattering time",
    ", the detection can be resonant or non - resonant . in the resonant case ,",
    "plasma waves excited by the incident radiation reflect from the drain and source ends of the channel and create a  standing wave in an analogy with sound waves in an acoustic resonator . in theory , the frequency of the resonance depends on the electron concentration and can be tuned with the gate polarization . in the non - resonant case , the scattering time is too short to allow for generation of standing plasma waves and damped plasma oscillations develop only at the vicinity of the fet source .",
    "a  detailed discussion of these issues has been recently presented in ref .  .",
    "the theoretical proposal @xcite stimulated a  large number of experiments starting from the first demonstration of thz detection with a  fet a  decade ago @xcite ( for a  review , see ) . although the general concept of a  fet as a  thz detector was confirmed in a  large number of experiments , neither of known types of fet showed , up to now , plasma resonances at room - temperature .",

    "the research on low - temperature detection with fets is far less developed .",
    "there exists a  huge volume of theoretical and experimental results related to a  two - dimensional ( 2d ) plasma investigation which started in 1977 with a  low - temperature fourier spectroscopy on a  si - mosfet @xcite .",
    "no doubt , from this perspective , different types of plasmon resonances in 2d systems seem to be perfectly well understood and analyzed .",
    "a  comprehensive review on this topic can be found in ref .  .",
    "however , developments of thz techniques , concepts and applications which have been created during last 20 years for room - temperature fet - based devices do not find their equally abundant counterpart in a low - temperature research .",
    "the present work aims to answer a  few questions which are related to the construction and performance of thz detectors fabricated for a  low - temperature thz magnetospectroscopy .",
    "the basic idea of the study was to investigate devices in which plasmon resonances could give a  strong and tunable signal .",
    "this led us to fabrication of fet - like devices with the design of the gate metallization formed as a  meander and an ungated reference sample of the same dimensions .",
    "next , the detectors were tested in two different experiments : a  fourier magnetospectroscopy and a  thz - laser magnetospectroscopy .",

    "generation of plasmons in samples without a  grid seems to contradict the general idea that a  grid coupler ( i.e. , a periodic structure ) is necessary to couple incident photons with 2d plasma excitations , but the phenomenon is know for more than 20 years@xcite .",

    "the peak is moving with the magnetic field towards higher frequencies and corresponds to the cyclotron resonance transition modified by magnetoplasmon excitations .",
    "the peak is broad enough to observe subsidiary maxima which appear with the period of ( 7.24@xmath460.22 )  @xmath16 ( see the insets to figs .  [ h1-abs ] and [ h2-abs ] ) .",
    "since the period of these oscillations corresponds to interferences in the gaas substrate , they are neglected in the  further analysis . for each spectrum",

    "we observe that the resonance frequency of the gated hall bar is higher than that of the ungated one by a  few @xmath16 .",
    "this results from the excitation of a  magnetoplasmon which blue - shifts the resonance frequency in the gated sample .",
    "fitting eq .",
    "[ mps ] to the gated sample data gives the plasmon frequency at zero magnetic field equal to ( 13.2@xmath460.5 )  @xmath16 which coincides with the frequency of @xmath47 mode obtained from the thz laser experiment , shown in fig .",
    "[ dyspersja - gated ] .",
    "contrary to the thz laser spectroscopy results , we do not observe higher ( @xmath48 ) magnetoplasmon modes in the fourier spectroscopy experiment which is caused by a  much smaller thz radiation power incident on the sample and its wide spectrum .",
    "we do not observe signatures of magnetoplasmon excitations in the ungated sample .",
    "this is related to the spectral resolution of the measurements which is discussed in fig .",
    "[ resolution ] .",
    "the experiments were carried out with the resolution equal to 0.2  @xmath16 and 0.5  @xmath16 in the case of ungated and gated samples , respectively .",

    "[ dyspersja - gated ] and [ dyspersja - ungated ] ) .",
    "one can notice , that with given experimental resolution , it is not possible to discriminate the plasmon from the cr for magnetic fields higher than about 4.5  t and 6.5  t for ungated and gated samples , respectively .",

    "[ resolution ] approximately recalculates @xmath49 into the magnetic field scale @xmath56 which shows that the resolution of 0.005  t in the laser experimental system allows to discriminate between the cr and plasmon peaks even at high magnetic fields .",
    "the amplitude of the resonance present in fourier spectra show a  non - monotonic dependence on the magnetic field . to analyze this dependence",
    "we refer to a  model described in refs .  .",
    "its essence lies in an assumption that absorption of a  thz radiation changes the electron distribution function .",
    "this can be approximately described as a  change of the electron temperature @xmath57 , which becomes higher than the lattice temperature @xmath58 . in a  gated sample , there is a  strict correspondence between the gate potential and the electron distribution function ( it just reflects the fact that the electron concentration can be changed with the gate polarization ) .",
    "for this reason , changes in the electron temperature can be observed as changes of the gate  to  channel potential , as it was done in ref .   where the gate  to  channel photovoltage was investigated . in our case ,",
    "typically a  drain  to  source photovoltage was measured ( see the inset to fig .",
    "[ lamp ] to recall the names of the sample s contacts ) which was proved to be essentially identical to that of a  gate  to  source , as fig .",
    "[ pvudsug ] shows .",
    "this similarity must exists since in gated samples gate  to  source and drain  to  source potentials are dependent under the open drain conditions , as it is the case of a  pv measurements .",
    "to explain the origin of a  pv signal in an ungated sample we note that an asymmetry must be present in the sample which allows for a  charge separation and generation of a  pv under the incidence of thz radiation .",
    "since the process of charge separation depends on the electron diffusion , it is influenced by the electron distribution function , hence @xmath57 .",

    "[ wzor ] . in the experiment ,",
    "only the amplitude of the photovoltage was measured .",
    "for this reason , the modulus of the function  [ wzor ] was fitted to the data .",
    "our measurements were done for magnetic fields corresponding , approximately , to @xmath67 .",
    "for this reason , the fitting function was composed of a  sum of two contributions , one corresponding to @xmath68 and the other  to @xmath69 .",
    "we estimated @xmath57 in two ways .",
    "first , we assumed that @xmath57 is constant , i.e. , it does not depend on the magnetic field .",
    "this is an approximation since heating of the electron gas is the most efficient with photons of the energy close to that of the cr and the spectral intensity of the thz source in the fourier spectrometer is not constant .",
    "that is why , we assumed that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a  normalized power of the thz source , shown in fig .",
    "[ lamp ] , with the argument @xmath0  determined according to @xmath72 , where @xmath73  is the photon energy . this model gives the maximal heating efficiency at the magnetic field equal to about 3.7  t which corresponds to the cr at @xmath74  @xmath16 .",
    "finally there were two fit parameters only : @xmath75  the difference between temperatures of electrons and the lattice ( 4.2  k ) and @xmath61  a  scaling factor for the function ( [ wzor ] ) .",
    "results of both fitting procedures are shown in fig .",
    "one can notice that the model describes the experimental data with a  reasonable accuracy .",
    "also , a  better fitting results are obtained with an assumption of a  @xmath0-dependent electron temperature ( dashed lines ) than with a  constant one ( solid lines ) .",
    "fitted values of @xmath76 are equal to 21.0  k and 3.0  k for the ungated and gated samples , respectively .",
    "the same value of @xmath61  was used for both samples .",
    "taking into account that the pv signal was observed for the source intensity higher than 0.2 of the maximum value , the electron temperature changes between ( 4.2 + 0.2 * 21.0 )  k = 8.4  k to 25.5  k for the ungated sample and between 4.8  k and 7.2  k for the gated one .",
    "an analysis of eq .",
    "[ wzor ] shows that a  sharp feature in @xmath77 should be expected at @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , such abrupt changes are clearly visible in the data presented in fig .",
    "since transport measurements were not done during the fourier spectroscopy measurements , we estimated the value of the filling factor by assuming that @xmath79 corresponds to @xmath0 = 5.6  t and 5.0  t in the case of ungated and gated samples , respectively .",
    "this leads , correspondingly , to @xmath80  @xmath4 and @xmath81  @xmath4 .",
    "these values are by about 10 - 15% less than obtained at the thz laser spectroscopy and magnetotransport measurements ( @xmath82  @xmath4 and @xmath83  @xmath4 ) which can result from the dependence of @xmath10 on a  particular cooling cycles in these two separate experiments .",

    "[ h1-abs ] and [ frequency ] , is suitable for application at high enough @xmath0 . at lower fields one can observe a  deviation from the linearity related to excitation of magnetoplasmons .",
    "thus , designing a  detector one should be aware of magnetoplasmons that can be generated by the radiation . according to our analysis ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the range of magnetic fields at which the separation of the magnetoplasmon from the cr position is lower than the experimental resolution ( see fig .  [ resolution ] ) . on the other hand , oscillations of the resonance intensity with the electron filling factor , observed also by other groups@xcite ,",
    "can limit the applicability of the detector since one can not trace the investigated signal in a  broad range of @xmath0  with the same sensitivity .",
    "it is not obvious to determine by theoretical considerations the wave vector of the fundamental plasmon mode in a  given sample .",
    "the thing is that in a  real detector one always finds some metallization pads or signal - conducting paths which can trigger plasmon excitation with a  wave vector determined by a  geometrical detail of the structure .",
    "this is clearly seen in the investigated samples where under the same conditions of laser excitations , plasmons were generated according to the geometry of the grid - gate or side signal paths ( in this case , paths leading to hall voltage pads ) .",
    "the energy difference between the fundamental modes in these two cases is equal to about 7  @xmath16 which is far more than the spectral resolution of measurements .",
    "testing the same detectors at much lower frequencies , in the range 0.1  0.6  thz , we found that we were able to excite plasmons with the wave vector of the fundamental mode equal to the width of the mesa , i.e. , 65  @xmath7m.@xcite taking all these observations into account we conclude that the spectrum of plasmons generated depends both on the range of the radiation frequency used and geometrical details of a  given detector design .",
    "this variety of possible plasmons generated in one sample can be considered as discouraging , but we rather see in this observation a  chance to control plasmon resonances by a  proper design of the detector geometry . for instance , if in the ungated sample investigated the fundamental mode of the plasmons corresponds to the width of a  side path , one could propose a  device with tens of such paths positioned at the circumference of the mesa .",
    "such a  design should lead to a  strong amplification of the plasmonic response .    summing up",
    ", in a  fourier spectroscopy experiments , the detectors investigated showed a  clear and narrow spectral response but the amplitude of the signal strongly depends on the magnetic field . the narrow spectral width results from the fact that only one magnetoplasmon mode was generated in the fourier experiment .",
    "since the variations of the amplitude of the detection signal result from basic physical properties of a  2deg , we consider this drawback as hard to eliminate . in a  thz laser spectroscopy ,",
    "the signal is spectrally much broader and dominated by a  number of plasmon resonances triggered according to the geometrical details of the detector design and the range of thz frequency radiation used .",
    "we suggest that the geometry of a  properly designed detector could stimulate generation of only one plasmon mode which could lead to a  narrow response in thz laser spectroscopy experiments .",

    "excitation with a  thz laser allowed to determine dispersion relations of plasmons . in the case of the gated sample ,",
    "magnetoplasmons were generated with the wave vector of the fundamental mode equal to the period of the grid .",
    "for the ungated sample , it was determined by details of the geometry of the mesa .",
    "fourier spectroscopy showed that the amplitude of the magnetoplasmon resonance was an oscillating function of the electron filling factor which can be described by a  model assuming an increase of the electron gas temperature .",

    "<S> it was also found that the magnetoplasmon spectrum depended on the gate geometry which gives an additional parameter to control plasma excitations in thz detectors . </S>",
    "<S> fourier spectra showed a  strong dependence of the cyclotron resonance amplitude on the conduction - band electron filling factor which was explained within a  model of the electron gas heating with the thz radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the study allows to define both the advantages and limitations of plasmonic devices based on high - mobility gaas / algaas heterostructures for thz detection at low temperatures and high magnetic fields . </S>"
