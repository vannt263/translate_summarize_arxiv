    "since its introduction by karoski , scheinerman , and singer  cohen @xcite the random intersection graph model and its generalisations have proven to have many applications . to mention just a few :  gate matrix layout  for vlsi design ( see e.g. @xcite ) , cluster analysis and classification ( see e.g. @xcite ) , analysis of complex networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) , secure wireless networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) or epidemics ( @xcite ) . for more details",

    "we connect vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 by an edge if sets @xmath3 and @xmath12 intersect .    in the course of last years various properties of random intersection graph were studied .",
    "however still little is known about algorithms which might efficiently construct or find structures in random intersection graphs . in this article",
    "we address the problem of efficiently finding a hamilton cycle in @xmath0 .",
    "the problem of determining a threshold function for the property of having a hamilton cycle in random intersection graph has already been studied by several authors , for example : efthymiou and spirakis @xcite , rybarczyk @xcite ( both for the model considered in this paper ) , and bloznelis and damarackas @xcite ( for the uniform random intersection graph model ) .",
    "here we analyse algorithmic aspects of the problem of finding a hamilton cycle in @xmath0 . in @xcite raptopoulos and spirakis",
    "proposed a randomised algorithm which with probability tending to 1 as @xmath13 in polynomial time finds a hamilton cycle in @xmath0 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 tending slowly to infinity .",
    "our aim is to show that there exists an algorithm which efficiently finds a hamilton cycle in @xmath0 for a wider range of parameters @xmath17 . to this end",
    "we take algorithm ham introduced by bollobs , fenner , and fieze in @xcite and analyse its performance on @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the minimum degree at least 2 with probability close to 1 guarantees that ham successfully finds a hamilton cycle in @xmath0 in polynomial time .",
    "all limits in the paper are taken as @xmath18 . throughout the paper",
    "we use standard asymptotic notation @xmath19 if @xmath20 as @xmath13 and @xmath21 if there exists a constant @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , for large @xmath24 . by @xmath25 we denote the binomial distribution with parameters @xmath24 , @xmath26 .",

    "theorem  [ twierdzeniehamiltongp ] together with the probability of the event that the minimum degree of @xmath0 is at least 2 , @xmath44 , gives the probability of the property that ham finds a hamilton cycle in @xmath0 .",

    "namely , in section  [ sectionproperties ] we study the properties of @xmath0 , which are crucial for the analysis of algorithm ham on @xmath0 and we discuss the notion of deletable sets . in section  [ sectionproof ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ twierdzeniehamiltongp ] in the case @xmath54 and @xmath55 using facts proved in the first part of the article . in section  [ sectionsmallm ]",
    "we explain how to adjust the proof to the case where @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
