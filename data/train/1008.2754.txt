    "recently , various peculiar fast - evolving sne have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the type ib sn 2002bj .",
    "they showed its rise time ( @xmath1 day ) and following decay ( @xmath4 ) was much faster than type ib sne as well as regular type ia sne ( @xmath5 ; e.g. @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : b15 ] ) , and even faster than the faint ( typically m@xmath6 mag ) and fastest sn 1991bg - like events ( @xmath7 ; e.g. @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : b15 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it reached a peak luminosity of m@xmath8 mag , i.e. it was not a faint sn .",
    "the total inferred mass in its ejecta was found to be at most @xmath9 m@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite described a class of type ib events ( with the prototypical sn 2005e ) , also inferred to have @xmath10 m@xmath3 of ejecta , and likely associated with old environments .",
    "however , these sne differ from sn 2002bj as they show faint peak luminosities ( typically m@xmath11 mag ) , they have a slower evolution ( @xmath12 , although the rise time is unknown ) and are calcium rich",
    ".    such properties for supernovae of type ib are remarkable .",
    "type ib sne , i.e. showing evidence of helium ( but not hydrogen ) in their spectra , are generally thought to originate from the core - collapse explosion of massive ( stripped ) stars of at least a few solar masses , and show much slower evolution .",
    "the old environments found for the class of sn 2005e - like events , and the low ejected mass , found for both types of sne ( sn 2005e - like sne and sn 2002bj ) , therefore suggest different explosion model(s ) for them .",
    "one suggested mechanism is helium - shell detonations on white dwarfs ( wds ; @xcite ) .",

    "data shown for type ia sne ( @xmath14 signs ; taken from @xcite , table 1 ) , including faint fast sne similar to sn 1991bg ( e.g. sne with @xmath15 ) , as well as estimated @xmath13 for sn 2005e , interpolated from its light curve ( @xmath16 sign ; @xcite ) . these can be compared with the @xmath13 measured for sn 2002bj ( @xmath17 sign ; @xcite ) and sn 1939b ( @xmath18 sign ) , and the estimated @xmath13 for sn 1885a , which has a range of possible peak magnitudes ( solid line , connecting the @xmath19 signs ) . the specific peak magnitude and @xmath13 values for sne",
    "sn 1885a are unknown , as no direct b - band data are available . limiting values for the peak magnitude",
    "are obtained under two possible assumptions ; ( 1 ) a constant @xmath20 in the 15 days epoch post - peak ( bottom triangle ) , corresponding to the inferred values for sn 1885a assuming a similar evolution as found for sub - luminous sn 1991bg - like sne @xcite and suggested from visual observations @xcite , or ( 2 ) a constant @xmath21 ( top triangle ) corresponding to a similar evolution to that observed for sn 2002bj .",
    "the photographic magnitudes of sn 1939b are taken to be similar to b - magnitudes @xcite .",
    "error bars are not shown ; typical error bars on @xmath13 are @xmath22 ; typical error bars on peak luminosity are @xmath22 , not including error bars from distance modulus ( typically @xmath23 ) .",
    "detailed discussion on the error estimates and the @xmath13-peak luminosity relation can be found in @xcite . ]    the existence of thermonuclear helium - detonation sne from the explosion of helium - accreting sub - chandrasekhar mass wds was theoretically predicted a few decades ago @xcite .",
    "variants of these models ( including helium deflagration ) predicted faint sne , ejecting @xmath10 m@xmath3 of material ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied the production of fast evolving sne with low ejected mass ( so called .ia sne ) .",
    "they initially suggested their light curves evolve even faster than observed for sn 2005e @xcite , e.g. @xmath24 , possibly as fast as observed in sn 2002bj .",
    "however , detailed light curve modeling by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that the expected light curves from their helium - detonation sn models , some of which peak at similar luminosities , decay more slowly than sn 2002bj @xcite , while lower luminosity models are possibly similar to sn 2005e , under appropriate conditions .",
    "the rise time of these sne , however , is comparable with that expected from these models @xcite .    in the case of sne",
    "similar to sn 2005e , a larger sample ( 8 sne ) and several independent properties support the wd helium - shell detonation scenario ( including their old stellar environments and their calcium rich spectra ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is not the case for sn 2002bj .    in the following",
    "we present the study of two other sne with bright but fast - evolving light curves ( sne 1885a and 1939b ) similar to 2002bj in the observed b / v - band .",
    "these historical sne were previously suggested to originate from helium - shell detonations @xcite , but were not considered in the study of sn 2002bj . in this study",
    "we would like to remedy this and give additional data to complement the picture .",
    "the data for these sne are of course less complete than could be obtained with modern instruments .",
    "however , we do not find evidence of any systematic errors or biases , suggesting that the data quality is sufficient to reveal the intrinsic properties of the sne .",
    "the sne we discuss provide additional clues to the origin of the fastest evolving sne .",
    "in particular , they provide direct evidence for old , non - star forming environments for at least some of these sne ( sne 1885a and 1939b ) , likely excluding young massive progenitors and pointing to low - mass , old progenitors such as wds .",
    "they also provide further evidence for the low ejecta mass ( much lower than the chandrasekhar mass ) of such sne , and possibly the importance of other elements and/or processes beside @xmath25ni decay in driving the sn light curves at early epochs .",
    "in addition , the low ejecta mass inferred for sn 1885a is consistent with the low x - ray luminosity of the observed sn remnant ( snr ) in m31 , as we will show , thus providing a light - curve - independent constraint on the sn ejecta .",
    "these events also provide us with further data on the frequency of such sne . finally , the lack of clear evidence for helium in the spectrum of sn 1939b could give an additional , although puzzling , clue to the origin of these sne and the processes involved in their explosions .",
    "this recently studied sn was shown to be an unusually fast - evolving type ib sn @xcite . here",
    "we reproduce some of its observations to serve as context for the discussion of the two additional fast - evolving sne described below .",
    "sn 1885a ( s andromeda ) , discovered in the bulge of m31 , was the first sn reported in the modern era of astronomy .",

    "similarly , sn 1885a does not show signs of leveling , and continuously becomes much fainter at late times after the break . ] .",
    "the slope of sn 1885a at this epoch ( @xmath34 mag per day ) is similar to that observed for type ia sne at late epochs ( see the non - stretched sn ia template light curve in fig . [",
    "fig : the - light - curves ] , and the light curve of sn 1991bg ) .",
    "the light curve of sn 1939b , however , decays more slowly after the break ( @xmath35 mag per day ) .",
    "the late time exponential decay behavior of sn 1885a may suggest a similar origin as for regular type ia sne at this epoch , namely the radioactive decay of @xmath25co .",
    "the resemblance between sne 1885a and 1991bg at this epoch is in stark contrast to their early behavior , showing a large difference between their peak luminosities . in type ia sne the peak luminosity",
    "is thought to be driven by the energy deposition from @xmath25ni decay , whereas the late decay is thought to be driven by its product ( @xmath25co ) . at early epochs the @xmath36-rays ( emitted as @xmath25ni decays to @xmath25co and then to @xmath25fe )",
    "are still trapped in the ejecta and deposit their energy there through successive compton scatterings . at later times , however , and especially for the case of low ejecta mass ( as is likely the case for the fast evolving sne ) the column density of the ejecta may may not be thick enough to trap the @xmath36-rays and they may escape without depositing their energy into the ejecta . in principle , this could explain the difference between the luminosities of the sne at different epochs , as sn 1885a seems to have much lower mass of ejecta .",
    "however , when estimating the difference in the fraction of @xmath36-rays absorbed inside the ejecta we find that it could only account for a small fraction of the observed difference , as we now show .    the electron ( thompson ) optical depth is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the atomic number , @xmath39 is the mass number , m@xmath40 is mass of proton , @xmath41 is the thompson cross - section and @xmath42 is the radius at time @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the optical depth at the epoch of peak luminosity is sufficient to trap most of the @xmath36-rays . assuming a similar energy source from radioactive decay",
    ", we expect the ratio between the luminosities of sne 1885a and sn 1991bg to reflect the ratio between their @xmath25ni ejecta mass , m@xmath44 .",
    "next , following @xcite we use a fitting formula ( as given in @xcite ; equation 47 ) to estimate the fraction of @xmath36-rays that are effectively absorbed inside the ejecta , @xmath45 . at late times",
    "( 100 days ) we find @xmath46 to be @xmath47 m@xmath3 and @xmath48 m@xmath3 for sn ejecta of @xmath49 m@xmath3 ( corresponding to the mass estimate derived below for sn 1885a ) and @xmath50 m@xmath51 ( for a typical type ia sn ) , respectively . at this epoch",
    "the radiation is dominated by the energy deposition from the radioactive decay of @xmath25co rather than the @xmath25ni decay ( which has a half life time of only @xmath26 days ) , and therefore @xmath52 where l@xmath53 is the radioactive power released by the decay of @xmath25co ( following @xcite , where the kinetic energy of positrons is 3.5 % of l@xmath53 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the difference in @xmath36-rays absorption between the two sne changes their relative luminosities by only a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - light - curves ] the ratio between the sn luminosities at peak vs. late epoch can not be accounted for by this factor . even if the effective optical depth is ten times larger than the simple thompson optical depth we use ( e.g. @xcite find few to ten times larger depth ) the ratio we find changes only by order unity ( 0.4 instead of 0.5 ) .",
    "we note that the estimated thompson optical depth we use is calculated at the bottom of the ejecta , where as not all of the @xmath36-rays is emitted from there .",
    "it is therefore possible that a large fraction of the @xmath36-rays may not be trapped even at peak luminosity .",
    "this issue is more likely to affect the less massive ejecta of sn 1939b , in which case the observed peak luminosity of sn 1939b is even lower than it would have been if all the @xmath36-rays were trapped .",
    "the inconsistency between the peak and the tail ratios for sn 1939b and sn 1991bg which we discuss might therefore be even larger than we calculated .",
    "we conclude that one requires a different / additional mechanism to drive the light curve at an early epoch .",
    "one possible explanation is that sn 1885a had other radioactive elements with short lifetime which contributed to the early light curve generation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that an additional data point at day 20 ( post - maximum ) exists for sn 2002bj in bands other than v ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) , possibly suggesting a steeper slope than sn 1885a and sn 1939b at this epoch .",
    "this is seen in the b and r bands , which likely bracket the v band to a similar magnitude .",
    "the i band behavior , however , shows a less steep slope , and is quite unique ; we see an @xmath55 for sn 2002bj at this epoch , which is much larger than found for any type of sne ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "the color evolution of sn 1885a and sn 1939b is unknown , as no filtered data are available .",
    "color descriptions summarized by @xcite suggest a value of @xmath56 for sn 1885a at peak , much larger than the @xmath57 observed for sn 2002bj .",
    "sn 1885a is one of the very rare cases where both the sn and its snr could be observed .",
    "after several failed attempts to find optical , radio , and x - ray emission at the location of sn 1885a , the snr was finally discovered _ in absorption _ against the bulge of m31 @xcite and later studied in detail using hst @xcite .",
    "the lack of direct emission from this 125 yr old snr is remarkable .",

    "the thermal x - ray emission from a young snr is determined mainly by the density of the ambient medium and the mass and kinetic energy of the sn ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have analyzed the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission in the central arcminute of m31 ( which includes the position of sn 1885a ) , and find an average density of @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "this gas density is low , as befits the bulge of a spiral galaxy , but only an order of magnitude lower than the ambient medium density around the tycho snr @xcite , and only a factor 2 - 3 lower than around the remnant of sn 1006 @xcite , which are prototypical type ia snrs .",

    "sn 2002bj is found at the outer region of a nearly face - on barred spiral galaxy ( ngc 1821 ; @xcite ) . as mentioned by @xcite ,",
    "the diverse stellar population of such galaxies preclude any strong inference on the progenitor system .",
    "we note that the old environment found for two out of the three sne in the sample ( where the properties of the close environment of third , sn 2002bj , are not known ) suggest the progenitors for these sne are old , possibly older than those of regular type ia sne .",
    "this may be similar to the case of sn 1991bg - like and sn 2005e - like events ; 70 % and 50 % of which , respectively , are found in early type galaxies ( e and s0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the progenitors of these sne are therefore most likely to be wds .",
    "many calculations of sn rates have been reported in the literature , some of which included the sne discussed in this paper . although these studies did not discuss the fast - evolving sne specifically ( except for those using the loss survey data ; @xcite ) , they can be used to estimate how common these objects are . in table 1",
    "we summarize the relative fraction of such sne , based on various sn rate estimates .",
    "poisson statistics are used to derive uncertainties .",
    "based on these calculations , we conclude that the various estimates are generally consistent with a fraction of @xmath102 % of all observed sne being bright and fast - evolving sne . given the typically much shorter timescale of these sne ( 2 - 3 shorter than typical type ia sne ) , the actual fraction could be twice as large for large cadence surveys , and therefore our estimate likely serves as a lower limit , with an upper limit of @xmath103 @xmath104 .",
