    "<S> we describe the present status of the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) as it originates from several sources : ( i ) a nonperturbative approach based on qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates , ( ii ) an @xmath0 qcd analysis of the cleo data on @xmath1 with asymptotic and renormalon models for higher twists , and ( iii ) recent high - precision lattice qcd calculations of the second moment of the pion da . </S>",
    "<S> we show predictions for the pion electromagnetic form factor , obtained in analytic qcd perturbation theory , and compare it with the jlab data on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss in this context an improved model for nonlocal condensates in qcd and show its consequences for the pion da and the @xmath3 transition form factor . </S>",
    "<S> we include a brief analysis of meson - induced massive lepton ( muon ) drell  yan production for the process @xmath4 , considering both an unpolarized nucleon target and longitudinally polarized protons . </S>"
