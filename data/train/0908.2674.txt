    "in quantum field theory , the concept of negative energy physics has attracted considerable attention for a long time .",
    "quantum interference can produce various states containing regions of negative energy , although the total energy remains nonnegative @xcite .",
    "the concept of negative energy plays important roles in many fundamental problems of physics , including traversable wormhole @xcite , cosmic censorship @xcite , and the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , its physical application to quantum optics has been discussed @xcite .",
    "recently , negative energy physics has yielded a quantum protocol called quantum energy teleportation ( qet ) in which energy can be transported using only local operations and classical communication ( locc ) without breaking causality and local energy conservation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "qet can be theoretically considered in various many - body quantum systems including 1 + 1 dimensional massless fields @xcite , spin chains @xcite and cold trapped ions @xcite . based on developing measurement technology with sensitive energy resolution for the systems",
    ", the qet effect might be observable in future",
    ". it may be also possible to enhance the amount of teleported energy by preparing a large number of parallel qet channels , performing a qet protocol for each channel and accumulating each teleported energy so as to achieve desired amount of total energy .",
    "after future experimental verification of qet , amazing possibility would be open in principle for nano - technology application of qet .",
    "for example , it may be imagined that , without heat generation in the intermediate subsystems of the qet channels , energy is transported in nano - machines at a speed much faster than the evolution speed of excitations of the channels .",
    "this technology , if possible , helps future development of quantum computers in which energy distribution and quantum tasks in the devices are completed before heat generation in the system .",
    "qet is also expected to provide insights on unsolved problems in gravitational physics .",
    "in fact , a qet process has already been analyzed in black hole physics , and from the measured information of zero - point oscillation of quantum fields , it can be regarded as controlled black hole evaporation if we consider the protocol near the horizon of a large - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "energy transportation usually requires physical carriers of energy such as electric currents and radiation waves .",
    "energy is infused into the gateway point of a transport channel connected to a distant exit point . then , energy carriers of the channel excite and propagate to the exit point . at the exit point",
    ", energy is extracted from the carriers and harnessed for many purposes . on the other hand , in the qet protocols , energy can be extracted from the exit point even if no excited energy carriers arrive at the exit point of the channel .",
    "we locally measure quantum fluctuation around the gateway point in the ground state of the channel system and announce the measurement result to the distant exit point with zero energy density , where we can extract energy from the channel .",
    "a key feature is that this measurement result includes information about the quantum fluctuation of the channel around this distant point via quantum correlation of the ground state of the channel system .",
    "therefore , we can infer details about the behavior of a distant fluctuation from the result of the local measurement . to compensate the extraction of this information",
    ", some amount of energy must be infused into the channel system at the measurement point ; this is regarded as input energy to the gateway point of the channel . by choosing and performing a proper local operation based on the announced information at the distant point",
    ", the local zero - point oscillation around the distant point can be suppressed relative to the ground - state one , yielding a negative energy density . during the operation , respecting local energy conservation , positive amount of surplus energy",
    "is moved from the channel system to external systems .",
    "this is regarded as output teleported energy from the exit point of the channel .",
    "one of the important unresolved problems in qet is the theoretical clarification of the properties in 1 + 3 dimensions .",
    "protocols in 1 + 1 dimensions have already been extensively analyzed in  previous studies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , 1 + 3 dimensional models have not yet been analyzed .",
    "in addition , all the protocols proposed thus far adopt quantum measurements for discrete - variable information .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to investigate not only a protocol with discrete - variable information but also one with continuous - variable information . in this study",
    ", we carry out a detailed analysis of two qet protocols for 1 + 3 dimensional electromagnetic field in the coulomb gauge .",
    "local measurements of quantum fluctuations in the vacuum state of the field require energy infusion to the field .",
    "the infused energy is diffused to spatial infinity at the velocity of light and the state of the field soon becomes a local vacuum with zero energy around the measurement area .",
    "obviously , this escaped energy can not be taken back to the measurement area by local operations around this area if we do not know the measurement result of the fluctuation .",
    "however , if the measurement result is available , we can effectively take back a part of this energy to the measurement area by applying the qet mechanism . by carrying out a local unitary operation dependent on the measurement result for the measurement area with zero energy density ,",
    "the fluctuation of zero - point oscillation is squeezed and a negative energy density appears around the area , accompanied by the extraction of positive energy from the fluctuation to external systems .",
    "needless to say , without the measurement result , it is impossible to extract energy from the zero - energy fluctuation .",
    "one of the two qet protocols we will consider is a teleportation in which discrete - variable information about a fluctuation is obtained using a measurement with a 1/2 spin ( a qubit ) , and the other is a teleportation in which continuous - variable information is obtained using a measurement with a harmonic oscillator . the discrete - variable protocol is a straightforward extension of the protocol for a 1 + 1 dimensional field proposed in @xcite .",
    "the measurements are generalized ( povm ) ones that use probe systems ( 1/2 spin and harmonic oscillator ) strongly interacting with local electric field fluctuations during a short time .",
    "we prove that for a large energy input , the continuous - variable teleportation is more attractive than the discrete - variable teleportation . in the discrete - variable case ,",
    "the amount of teleported energy is suppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of energy infused by the measurement increases .",
    "meanwhile , this suppression factor becomes power damping in the continuous - variable case .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that obtaining more information about the quantum fluctuation leads to teleporting more energy .",
    "this result suggests a new profound relation between energy and quantum information .",
    "so far , relationship between energy and information has been extensively discussed only in the context of computation energy cost @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the qet viewpoint may shed light on a new relationship between amount of teleported energy and amount of quantum information about ground - state fluctuations which would be characterized by various informational indices including mutual information and entanglement .",
    "the explicit analysis about this relationship is beyond the scope of this paper and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a brief review of the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the coulomb gauge is presented in order to clarify our notations , and the emergence of negative energy density is explained . in section 3 , we discuss a discrete - variable protocol . in section 4 , a continuous - variable protocol is analyzed . in section 5 ,",
