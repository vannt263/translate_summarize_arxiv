    "thermal photons emitted from the hot fireball created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is a promising tool for providing a signature of quark - gluon plasma @xcite ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "since they participate only in electromagnetic interactions , they have a larger mean free path compared to the transverse size of the hot and dense matter created in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore these photons were proposed to verify the existence of the qgp phase @xcite .",
    "spectra of thermal photons depend upon the fireball temperature and they can be calculated from the scattering cross - section of the processes like @xmath1 , _ bremsstrahlung _ etc .",
    "time evolution of the temperature can be calculated using hydrodynamics with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "thus the spectra depend upon the equation of state ( eos ) of the medium and they may be useful in finding a signature of the quark - gluon plasma@xcite .",
    "recently thermal photons are proposed as a tool to measure the shear viscosity of the strongly interacting matter produced in the collisions@xcite .",
    "understanding the shear viscosity of qgp is one of the most intriguing aspects of the experiments at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "analysis of the experimental data collected from rhic shows that the strongly coupled matter produced in the collisions is not too much above the phase transition temperature @xmath2 and it may have extremely small value of shear viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "the ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath3 to the entropy density @xmath4 i.e. @xmath5 is around @xmath6 which is the smallest for any known liquid in the nature@xcite .",
    "in fact the arguments based on ads - cft suggest that the values of @xmath5 can not become lower than @xmath6 .",
    "this is now known as kovtun - son - starinets or kss- bound @xcite .",
    "thus the quark - gluon plasma produced in rhic experiments is believed to be in a form of the most perfect liquid@xcite .",
    "no wonder ideal hydrodynamic appears to be the best description of such matter as suggested by comparison between the experimental data@xcite and the calculations done using second - order relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .    however there",
    "remain uncertainties in understanding the application and validity of the hydrodynamical procedure in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "it is only very recently realized that the effect of bulk viscosity can bring complications in the hydrodynamical description of the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "generally it was believed that the bulk viscosity , @xmath7 does not play a significant role in the hydrodynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it was argued that that since @xmath7 scaled like @xmath8 at very high energy the bulk viscosity may not play a significant role because the matter might be following the ideal gas type equation of state@xcite .",
    "but during its course of expansion the fireball temperature can approach values close to @xmath2 .",
    "recent lattice qcd results show that the quark - gluon matter do not satisfy ideal eos near @xmath2 and the ratio @xmath9 show a strong peak around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity contribution in this regime can be much larger than that of the the shear viscosity .",
    "recently the role of bulk viscosity in heating and expansion of the fireball was analyzed using one dimensional hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "another complication that bulk viscosity brings in hydrodynamics of heavy - ion collisions is phenomenon of cavitation@xcite .",
    "cavitation arises when the fluid pressure becomes smaller than the vapour pressure .",
    "since the bulk viscosity ( and also shear viscosity ) contributes to the pressure gradient with a negative contribution , it may be possible for the effective fluid pressure to become zero .",
    "once the cavitation sets in , the hydrodynamical description breaks down .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that cavitation may happen in rhic experiments when the effect of bulk viscosity is included in manner consistent with the lattice results .",
    "it was shown that the cavitation may significantly reduce the time of hydrodynamical evolution .    keeping the above discussion in mind",
    ", we aim to study the effect of bulk viscosity and cavitation on the thermal photon production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "as far as we know no such study exists in the literature . furthermore , the calculations for the photon production rates in the absence of viscous effects , are done using thermal distribution function of the particle species ( e.g. , quark , anti - quark etc.)@xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that viscous effects can lead to the modification of the thermal distribution functions@xcite .",
    "this may have observational effect on the photon spectra@xcite . in this work",
    "we incorporate the viscous modification in the distribution function arising due to bulk and shear viscosities .",
    "finite @xmath7 effect can either significantly reduce the time for the hydrodynamical evolution ( by onset of cavitation ) or it can increase the time by which the system reaches @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the _ non - ideal _ gas eos can also significantly influence the hydrodynamics . in",
    "what follows , we use equations of relativistic second order hydrodynamics to incorporate the effects of finite viscosity .",
    "we take the value of @xmath9 same as that in ref.@xcite and keep @xmath10 .",
    "further we use one dimensional boost invariant hydrodynamics in the same spirit as in refs.@xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of this approach is that the effects of transverse flow can not be incorporated .",
    "as the boost - invariant hydrodynamics is known to lead to under - estimation of the effects of bulk viscosity@xcite , we believe that our study of the photon spectra will provide a conservative estimate of the effect .",
    "however it should also be noted that the effect of transverse flow could remain small as cavitation can restrict the time for hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "we represent the energy momentum tensor of the dissipative qgp formed in high energy nuclear collisions as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy density , pressure and four velocity of the fluid element respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath15 acts as a projection perpendicular to four velocity .",

    "if one ignores the cavitation effect , then the hydrodynamical code can allow for temperature to evolve upto @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we have also observed that @xmath116 contribution dominates over @xmath115 contribution for @xmath1861.5 gev ( a similar behaviour is reported in the ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let us first note that for @xmath187 , the photon flux without cavitation is higher as compared the same with cavitation at the starting @xmath109 ( @xmath188 gev ) .",
    "this feature also continues when @xmath189 as can be seen in fig.[[fig10b ] ] .",
    "the negative contribution of @xmath116 on the curve without cavitation ( solid curve ) makes it plummate faster than the curve with cavitation with increasing @xmath109 ( dashed curve ) and both the curves intersect at @xmath1901.1 gev . beyond this , the shear viscosity starts becoming more effective and prevents this faster plummation of the solid curve .",
    "moreover , @xmath116 contribution dominates at @xmath191 gev thus in the regime @xmath191 , ignoring the cavitation effect can lead to over - estimation of the photon flux ; e.g. , at @xmath109 = 0.5 gev over - estimation is 150@xmath167 . whereas there is an under - estimation of the photon flux when the effect of cavitation is not included in the high @xmath109 regime .",
    "e.g. , for the following @xmath109 values 1.5 , 2.0 and 3.0 ( in gev ) under - estimations are around 50@xmath167 , 65@xmath167 and 30@xmath167 respectively .        in fig.[[fig11 ] ] we plot photon production rates for various cavitation times obtained by varying @xmath74 ( with @xmath192 is fixed ) . here",
    "the enhancement in the photon production when @xmath74 is reduced to half of its base value is about 75@xmath167 at @xmath182 gev and about 55@xmath167 at @xmath179 gev .",
    "a further reduction of the parameter value to @xmath193 is enhancing the photon production by about 120@xmath167 at @xmath182 gev and about 85@xmath167 at @xmath179 gev .",
    "the reason is a reduction in @xmath74 amounts to increase in the cavitation time ( see e.g. , fig.[[fig5 ] ] ) , which in turn increases the time interval over which photon production is calculated .",
    "therefore this increases the photon flux .        in fig.[[fig12 ] ] we show the effect of viscous corrections to the distribution function on photon production .",
    "here we consider the cavitation scenario with @xmath74 ( @xmath177 ) and @xmath73 ( = 0.901 ) .",
    "the solid curve shows the case @xmath187 .",
    "we can see from the figure that when we include only the shear viscosity correction ( @xmath194 ) , it enhances the photon production particularly in high @xmath109 regime@xcite .",
    "next we consider the corrections arising due to bulk viscosity @xmath195 only .",
    "the effective pressure due to @xmath20 is negative and we have seen that it is crucial for the cavitation to occur ( see eq.[[pressures ] ] ) . as a result number of particle with higher",
    "momenta are decreasing and therfore there is a reduction in photon rate as compared to the case without the viscous correction@xcite . as it is clear from the figure , the effect of bulk viscosity is to oppose the contribution from the shear viscosity .",
    "the combined effect of both shear and bulk viscosity corrections ( @xmath196 ) can be seen in the graph just below the top - most curve .",
    "it is clear from the graph that effect of viscous corrections to the distribution functions increases in the high @xmath109 regime .",
    "using the second order relativistic hydrodynamics we have analyzed the role of non - ideal effects near @xmath2 arising due to the equation of state , bulk - viscosity and cavitation on the thermal photon production from qgp .",
    "since the experiments at rhic imply extremely small values for @xmath5 , we take the value @xmath6 for shear viscosity .",
    "we have shown using non - ideal eos from the recent lattice results that the hydrodynamical expansion gets significantly slow down as compared to the case with the massless eos .",
    "this , in turn , enhances the flux of hard thermal photons .",
    "bulk viscosity plays a dual role in heavy - ion collisions : on one hand it enhances the time by which the system attains the critical temperature , while on the other hand it can make the hydrodynamical treatment invalid much before it reaches @xmath2 .",
    "another result we would like to emphasize is that if the viscous correction @xmath117 to the distribution function is not included , then ignoring cavitation can lead to a significant over - estimation of the photon production rate .",
    "but when the viscous corrections are included the situation can become more complex . in the low @xmath109 regime ( @xmath1971.1 gev )",
    "there is a significant over - estimation in the photon flux if cavitation is ignored . on the other hand , in the high @xmath109 regime ( @xmath1981.1 gev )",
    "the photon flux is under - estimated when the cavitation is ignored !",
