    "the model suggested by sakai and sugimoto ( ss ) @xcite offers a specific holographic realization that includes @xmath8 flavors and is chiral . for @xmath9 , chiral qcd",
    "is obtained as a gravity dual to @xmath8 @xmath10-@xmath11 branes embedded into a d4 background in 10 dimensions where supersymmetry is broken by the kaluza - klein ( kk ) mechanism .",
    "the ss model yields a holographic description of pions , vectors , axials and baryons that is in good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the ss model at finite temperature has been discussed in  @xcite and at finite baryon density in  @xcite . the finite baryon chemical potential problem in d3/d7 model",
    "was discussed in @xcite and isospin chemical potential and glueball decay also has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "cold and dense hadronic matter in qcd is difficult to track from first principles in current lattice simulations owing to the sign problem . in large @xmath6 qcd baryons",
    "are solitons and a dense matter description using skyrme s chiral model  @xcite was originally suggested by skyrme and others  @xcite",
    ". at large @xmath6 and high density matter consisting of solitons crystallizes , as the ratio of potential to kinetic energy @xmath12 is much larger than 1 .",
    "qcd matter at large @xmath6 was recently revisited in  @xcite .",
    "the many - soliton problem can be simplified in the crystal limit by first considering all solitons to be the same and second by reducing the crystal to a single cell with boundary conditions much like the wigner - seitz approximation in the theory of solids . a natural way to describe",
    "the crystal topology is through @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions . in",
    "so far , this problem can only be addressed numerically .",
    "a much simpler and analytically tractable approximation consists of treating each wigner - seitz cell as @xmath14 with no boundary condition involved .",
    "the result is dense skyrmion matter on @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the energetics of this phase is only few percent above the energetics of a more involved numerical analysis based on @xmath13 .",
    "skyrmions on @xmath14 restore chiral symmetry on the average above a critical density . while skyrmions on @xmath14 are unstable against @xmath13 , they still capture the essentials of dense matter and chiral restoration in an analytically tractable framework .",
    "cold dense matter in holographic qcd is a crystal of instantons with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fermi velocity .",
    "( in contrast hot holographic qcd has @xmath17 ) .",
    "when the wigner - seitz cell is _ approximated _ by @xmath14 , the pertinent instanton is defined on @xmath18 . in this paper , we investigate cold qcd matter using instantons on @xmath18 in bulk . as a result the initial d4 background is _ deformed _ to accomodate for the @xmath14 which is just the back reaction of the flavour crystal structure on the pure gauge theory .",
    "holographic dense matter can be organized in @xmath19 at large @xmath6 . in our model",
    "the baryon density is uniform while the chiral condensate is p - wave over a cell .",
    "however , the chiral condensation is averaged to be zero over a cell so that the chiral symmetry is effectively restored in long wavelength limit .",
    "we will show that as the average density goes up , it approaches to uniform distribution while the chiral condensate approaches to p - wave over a cell .",
    "the energy density in dense medium varies as @xmath2 , which is the expected power for non - relativistic fermion .",
    "this shows that the pauli exclusion effect in boundary is encoded in the coulomb repulsion in the bulk .    in section 2 , we define this deformation and discuss the d8 brane embedding structure .",
    "the instantons on @xmath18 in the flavour d8 brane is discussed in section 3 . in section 4,5,6",
    "we derive the equation of state of cold holographic matter using the small size instanton expansion and in general . in section 7",
    "we show how the holographic small instantons in bulk transmute large size skyrmions on the boundary .",
    "the comparison to other models of nuclear matter is carried in section 8 .",
    "our conclusions are in section 9 .",
    "we consider crystallized skyrmions at finite density in the wigner seitz approximation .",
    "spatial @xmath20 is naturally converted to @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions . as a result",
    "the d4 background geometry is deformed .",
    "the baryons are then instantons on @xmath21 .",
    "most solutions are only known numerically on the lattice .",
    "a simpler and analytically tractable analysis that captures the essentials of dense matter is to substitute @xmath13 by @xmath14 in bulk with no boundary conditions altogether . as a result",
    ", the d4 background dual to the crystal is modified with the boundary special space as @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , the 10 dimensional space is that of @xmath22 .",
    "the ensuing metric on d4 is therefore @xmath23 while this compactified metric is not an exact solution to the general relativity ( gr ) equations for small size @xmath14 , it can be regarded as an approximate solution for large size @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , in this case , the gr equations are seen to be sourced by terms wich are down by the size of @xmath14 . here , ( [ d4sol ] ) can be regarded as an approximation to the stable metric with @xmath13 for a dense matter analysis . clearly , the former is unstable against decay to the latter , which will be reflected by the fact that the energy of dense matter on @xmath14 is higher than that on @xmath13 .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the skyrmion analysis shows that the energy on @xmath14 is only few percent that of @xmath13 .",
    "so we expect the current approximation to capture the essentials of dense matter in holographic qcd .",

    "furthermore our action is the nonlinear dbi action and not a yang - mills action .",
    "however it can be shown that the yang - mills instanton in the space ( [ rwmetric ] ) is the leading order solution of @xmath50 expansion of the full metric and the dbi action as shown in @xcite .",
    "so the solution can be used in the leading order calculation .",
    "we summarize here the ( anti ) self dual instanton solution obatained in @xcite . using the ansatz , @xmath51 we get the field strength , in terms of vielbein whose relation to the coordinate @xmath52 is specified in @xcite , @xmath53 \\ e^b \\wedge e^c \\ , \\label{field.strength}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath54 .",

    "the units of mass and lengths are @xmath225 the point @xmath226 is the @xmath19 corrected mass ( [ next ] ) in these units . finally , it is interesting to note that the holographic skyrme model on @xmath14 yields _ naively _ the following equation of state @xmath227 as first noted in the context of the canonical skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath228 for the skyrmion stems from the universal current algebra @xmath229 term which is attractive and scales as @xmath230 as opposed to @xmath231 from the finite size instanton in bulk .",
    "the @xmath232 for the skyrmion stems from the repulsive coulomb contribution per unit 3-volume @xmath233 from the skyrme term as opposed to the repulsive coulomb contribution per unit 3-volume @xmath234 in the instanton in bulk .",
    "we recall that coulomb s law in 1+d dimensions is @xmath235 .    at high density",
    "the _ naive _ scalings in ( [ es.density ] ) obtained at the boundary differs from ( [ deos ] ) obtained in bulk in two essential ways : i ) @xmath236 and @xmath237 are of order @xmath238 on the boundary while their bulk contributions are of order @xmath239 ; ii ) the scaling with @xmath118 appears to differ by an extra ( spatial ) dimension , @xmath240 on the boundary and @xmath241 in bulk .",
    "these differences can be understood by noting that the size of the holographic skyrmion is @xmath131 .",
    "this means that the chiral gradients @xmath242 are nearly zero on the boundary with @xmath243 , except on an the shell @xmath244 of thickness @xmath109 to ensure that the topological baryon charge is finite   the skyrmion obeys the faddeev - bogomolnyi bound since the classical equations of motion are fulfilled . ] .",
    "this renders @xmath236 and @xmath237 in ( [ es.density ] ) effectively of order @xmath19 as noted in bulk .",
    "in fig.([fig : eint ] ) we compare the interaction energy ( [ eos1 ] ) and ( [ deos1 ] ) with other hadronic models including skyrme s chiral model .",
    "holographic matter is subtantially stiffer as explained through the energy budget in ( [ budget ] ) .",
    "the reason can be traced back to the fact that for a _ single _ baryon the repulsion already dwarfs the attraction in holographic qcd        at high densities @xmath94 in ( [ deos1 ] ) is approximated as @xmath245 and whatever @xmath8 since the flavoured instanton in bulk is always @xmath246 .",
    "this behaviour is different from that of free massless quarks in @xmath240 ( @xmath247 ) but similar to _ massive _ quarks in @xmath240 ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath249 so at strong coupling @xmath250 independently of @xmath251 and @xmath6 .",
    "as chiral symmetry is restored in the high density phase , the comparison to the the free massive quark phase in @xmath240 suggests that the mass @xmath252 is a chirally symmetric screening mass . while the chiral transition restores chiral symmetry it still confines baryons .",
    "we have provided a holographic description of dense and cold hadronic matter using the brane model put forward by sakai and sugimoto  @xcite . at large @xmath6",
    "the matter crystallizes and can be treated in the wigner - seitz approximation on @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    ", the wigner - seitz cell was further approximated by @xmath14 in space leading to a simple instanton configuration on @xmath18 with @xmath253 the conformal space .",
    "the resulting equation of state at next to leading order in @xmath214 shows a free quark behavior at high density , although the overall coefficient is cutoff sensitive and large resulting into a stiff euation of state .    at high densities",
    "the gauge gradients are of order @xmath254 so the dbi action may not be enough to fix the brane dynamics at order @xmath111  @xcite",
    ". also our simplification of @xmath13 by @xmath14 while justified at low density , involves curvature corrections at high densities .",
    "however , we believe that the essentials of dense matter in holographic qcd are already exposed on @xmath14 with a small attraction leading @xmath120 and a large coulomb repulsion leading @xmath2 , where 5/3 is the power of non - relativistic fermion .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the coulomb interaction in the bulk counts the fermi statistics in the boundary .",
    "the repulsion is @xmath115 times the attraction resulting into a very stiff equation of state .",
    "changing @xmath14 to @xmath13 will not affect the outcome quantitativaly we believe .",
    "indeed , this is the case for dense skyrmions  @xcite .",
    "the present work expands on the original ideas developed in  @xcite .",
    "our calculations with finite size instantons are closer to those presented in reference @xcite where finite size and homogeneous instantons were used through a variational estimate in @xmath255 .",
    "their arguments yield @xmath118 instead of the @xmath120 we have reported in the equation of state at next to leading order with our @xmath18 instanton .",
    "the inhomegeneous @xmath18 description of the crystal suggests that at high density , chiral symmetry is restored on the average . indeed , since the dual of the instanton cell is the skyrmion cell with a pion field restricted to @xmath14 in space .",
    "high density matter corresponds to small size @xmath14 where the pion field becomes just the unit map  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding chiral condensate on @xmath14 is seen to vanish as half of @xmath14 carries positive chiral condensate , while the other half carries negative chiral condensate so that on the average the chiral condensate is zero .",
    "this restoration of chiral symmetry is due to the formation of the crystal in the spatial direction in holographic qcd even though the @xmath10-@xmath11 configuration is still attached . in other words ,",
    "the left and right d8 branes cease to talk to each other through the spatial directions not the conformal direction when they _ crystallize at large @xmath6_.    the present crystal analysis is classical in bulk . a quantum analysis including vibrational and rotational motion is needed .",
    "these corrections are subleading in @xmath256 and should be estimated for a more thorough phenomenological discussion .",
    "also , the inhomogeneous phase can be probed approximatly by a dilute gas of instantons on @xmath13 allowing for a lower energetics than on @xmath14 .",
    "these issues and others will be discussed elsewhere .",
