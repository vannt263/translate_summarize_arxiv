    "field theoretical descriptions of hadronic two - body processes at large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 , based on the idea that strong interactions are mediated by colored gluons exchanged between color singlet states , have a long history .",
    "the identification of the pomeron with two , or more , gluon exchanges  @xcite , gave rise to the bfkl equation  @xcite whose asymptotic solution is the so - called `` lipatov pomeron '' .",
    "the born approximation to the pomeron , used also recently in many calculations of high energy processes , developed in a conformal field theory , at least in the leading - log approximation .",
    "0.3 cm at large momentum transfer squared , the perturbative approach will give sensible results for the observables of any hadronic exclusive process .",
    "non perturbative effects can however be important at small @xmath4 , surely they are present in the born approximation , and corrections to the pomeron pole in perturbative qcd are larger than expected in the next - to - leading approximation  @xcite .",
    "it could be interesting , at this stage , to consider a phenomenological model where , first , the pomeron is exchanged as a regge pole between off - shell gluons and , then , off - shell gluons couple to a color singlet , e.g. a @xmath5 state .",
    "a more sophisticated model , where quark and many - gluon components of the pomeron are considered , would be more realistic , but far more involved .",
    "the quark component , however , can be taken into account , in the simplest case , and this will be done in the following . 0.3 cm covariant reggeization  @xcite provide us with a differential technique that generates reggeized scattering amplitudes free from kinematical singularities and satisfying automatically factorization .",
    "the most important properties of this approach were its direct relation with toller poles  @xcite and the possibility to include easily spins of the particles coupled to the pomeron ensuring , for the latter , pure spin @xmath1 exchange where @xmath1 is its regge trajectory  @xcite .",
    "it could seem , at first sight , that this method does not have any predictive power since the couplings depend on a large number ( five for the gluonic component ) of unknown functions of @xmath0 .",
    "as will be seen later , constraints on the coupling of two off - shell gluons to `` white '' hadrons , yielding even c exchange , simplify noticeably this picture  @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm unless a specific choice of the partonic wave functions for the interacting hadrons and of the pomeron couplings to off - shell gluons is made , only formal properties of the scattering amplitude can be derived with the aforementioned technique .",
    "it turns out , however , that these properties are interesting enough to justify the general treatment of section * 2 * , where conditions on the scattering amplitude , frequently required on phenomenological grounds , are derived with a limited number of assumptions . in section",
    "* 3 * , a model will be considered for the pomeron as a double regge pole and formal constraints on the @xmath0 dependence of the amplitude will be derived . in this step a possible treatment of the non - perturbative region",
    "is proposed based on a suitable regularization procedure . in section * 4 * , the new amplitude is compared with the standard regge formalism by considering a particular example , proton - antiproton scattering at high energy .",
