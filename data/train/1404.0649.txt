    "uncertainty quantification in dynamic continuous models is an emerging area @xcite . because of the numerous complex factors that usually involve social behavior",
    ", it is particularly appropriate the consideration of randomness in this kind of models . in practice",
    ", the introduction of randomness in continuous models can be done using different approaches .",
    "stochastic differential equations of it - type consider uncertainty through a stochastic process called white noise , i.e. , the derivative of a wiener process . as a consequence ,",
    "this approach limitates the introduction of uncertainty to a gaussian process whose sample trajectories are somewhat irregular since they are nowhere differentiable .",
    "a more convenient approach in social modelling is to permit that input parameters can become random variables and/or stochastic processes and , therefore can follow other type of probability distributions apart from gaussian .",
    "this approach leads to continuous models usually referred to as random differential equations ( r.d.e.s ) . in dealing with r.d.e.s ,",
    "generalized polynomial chaos ( gpc ) is likely one of the most fruitful methods @xcite .",
    "most of the existing methods and techniques , start with the assumption that the model parameters follow a known standard probability distribution . in general",
    ", setting the probability distribution of the model parameters , standard or empirical , is a crucial and difficult task currently under study which is required for model uncertainty approaches .",
    "also , the computation is an important issue in dealing with uncertainty .",
    "for instance , gpc technique may not be affordable when the number of model parameters with uncertainty increases , or the interval where the mean and the standard deviation are valid may be very short @xcite .",
    "it may turn these techniques inappropriate for modelling real problems .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider that no information is available for setting the model parameters probabilistic distribution , techniques as bootstapping @xcite or bayesian @xcite are other useful approaches .",
    "related to these statistical techniques , in this paper we propose a computational approach where the data , retrieved from surveys , play a fundamental role to introduce the uncertainty , in estimation and prediction , from the very beginning .",
    "this probabilistic approach is applied to a model describing the evolution of the attitude of the basque population towards the revolutionary organization eta @xcite presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we summarize the model building described in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we propose a technique which will allow us to obtain a set of model parameters that provide @xmath1 confidence intervals for each time instant such that the data uncertainty is captured .",
    "we will call this technique _ probabilistic estimation_. with the set of parameters obtained in section 3 , in section 4",
    "we obtain a _",
    "probabilistic prediction _ of the attitude towards eta of the people of the basque country over the next four years . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the results and present the conclusion .",
    "in @xcite , the deterministic mathematical model was introduced , and series data were retrieved from the euskobarometro of november 2012 on the attitude of the basque country population towards eta ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 20 ) .",
    "the eight types of attitudes towards eta that appear in the euskobarometro ( total support ; justification with criticism ; goals yes / means no ; before yes / not now ; indifferent ; eta scares ; total rejection ; no answer ) were simplified to only three ( support ; rejection ; abstention ) and allowed us to divide basque country population into the following three subpopulations , time @xmath2 in years ( see @xcite for more details ) :    * * supporters . *",
    "@xmath3 , the percentage of people in the basque country which have an attitude of support towards eta at time instant @xmath2 , * * rejectors .",
    "* @xmath4 is the percentage of people in the basque country which have an attitude of rejection towards eta at time @xmath2 , * * abstentionists .",
    "* @xmath5 is the percentage of people in the basque country whose attitude towards eta is not defined ( indifferent ) , abstain or simply they do not want to declare their opinion , at time @xmath2 .    data grouped in these three groups appear , in percentages , in figure [ datos ] from may 1995 until nov 2012 . in",
    "may 2005 the spanish parliament approved the possibility the government to support dialogue with eta what has been considered as a substantial change in the anti - terrorist policy .",
    "this policy is still in force and it justifies we choose this time instant as our model initial condition . in table [ tabla1 ] we present the figures in percentages of each subpopulation from may 2005 to nov 2012 .",
    ".percentage of people in the basque country with respect to their attitude towards eta from may 2005 to nov 2012 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing data in table [ tabla6 ] to results in tables [ tabla3 ] , [ tabla4 ] and [ tabla5 ] , we can see that the data uncertainty in euskobarometro may 2013 is captured by our predictions in the three tables .",
    "in this paper , it is presented a computational technique to deal with uncertainty ( in parameter estimation and output predictions ) in dynamic social models based on systems of differential equations .",
    "this technique takes data from surveys to introduce the uncertainty into the model from the very beginning and returns @xmath1 model confidence interval bands that capture the data uncertainty and predict what will happen over the next future .    in order to present the possibilities of this technique ,",
    "it is applied to a mathematical model to study the evolution dynamics of the attitude of basque population towards eta . once the model is stated , we determine a probabilistic estimation in order to find out if the model captures the euskobarometro data evolution .",
    "we observe that the model captures the data uncertainty only partially from may 2005 to may 2007 , but from nov 2007 the probabilistic estimation improves perceptibly .",
    "anyway , the model estimation is non - rejectable using the @xmath0-test .",
    "then , we provide a probabilistic prediction of the attitude towards eta of the population of the basque country over the next four years .",
    "the predicted results point out that , if the political scenario does not change , the current situation will remain fairly stable .      * if we consider the model parameters as random variables , the technique presented here as probabilistic estimation allows the estimation of samples of these model parameters ( steps 3 , 4 and 5 of the procedure described in section [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "this fact is of paramount interest because one of main challenges in modelling real problems using random differential equations is to determine the distribution function of model parameters .",
    "therefore , if we use the probabilistic estimation to obtain some samples of the model parameters , in our case @xmath6 parameter samples , we can use these samples and statistical hypothesis testing or kernel functions in order to find distribution functions of the model parameters . *",
    "other aspect that should be mentioned and it could be interesting for survey prediction estimations is the fact that table [ tabla3 ] ( [ tabla4 ] and [ tabla5 ] ) may be considered as an estimation of the results of the coming euskobarometro surveys ( mean and @xmath1 confidence interval ) .",
    "this idea may be applied to this and other type of surveys where a reliable underlying dynamic model can be built . as a consequence ,",
    "some surveys may not be carried out with the corresponding saving of money .",
    "therefore , we consider that this approach may be an interesting tool for social behavior studies .",
