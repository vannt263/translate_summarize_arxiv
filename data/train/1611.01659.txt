    ", researchers have detected the validity of power laws , for a number of characteristic quantities of complex systems @xcite .",

    "is a fact of paramount relevance , along with the exploration of more grounding concepts .",
    "the literature dealing with the rank - size rule is rather wide : basically , papers in this field discuss why such a rule should work ( or does not work ) . under this perspective ,",
    "pareto distribution and power law , whose statement is that there exists a link of hyperbolic type between rank and size , seem to be suitable for this purpose . in particular , the so - called first zipf s law @xcite , which is the one associated to a unitary exponent of the power law , has a relevant informative content , since the exponent can be viewed as a proxy of the balance between outflow and inflow of agents .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the zipf s law has been the focus of a large number of important contributions @xcite .",
    "however , the reason why zipf s law is found to be a valid tool for describing rank - sizes rule is still a puzzle . in this respect",
    ", it seems that no theoretical ground is associated to such a statistical property of some sets of data @xcite .",
    "generally , zipf s law can not be viewed as a universal law , and several circumstances rely on data whose rank and size relationship is not of hyperbolic nature .",
    "such a statement is true even in the urban geography case , - the one of the original application of the zipf s law , for the peculiar case of cities ranking .",
    "remarkable breakdowns has been assessed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "a further example is given by the number @xmath0 of cities ( @xmath1 ) per provinces ( @xmath2 ) in italy ( @xmath3 8092 ) , see the log - log plot of the data from 2011 in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotnogood9zmppwldexp ] : the ( 110 ) provinces are ranked by decreasing order of `` importance '' , i.e. their number of cities .",
    "fits by ( i ) a power law , ( ii ) an exponential and ( iii ) a zipf - mandelbrot ( zm ) function @xcite    @xmath4^{\\omega},\\ ] ]    @xmath5 being the rank .",
    "the fits are , the least to say , quite unsatisfactory in particular in the high rank tail , essentially because data usually often presents an inflection point .    therefore , no need to elaborate further that more data analysis can bring some information on the matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ alternative ] , an alternative to a hyperbolic rank - size law and its above `` improvements '' are discussed : the data can be better represented by an ( other than zipf s law ) analytic empirical law , allowing for an inflection point .    next , we introduce a universal form , allowing for a wider appeal , in sect .",
    "[ universal ] , based on a model thereafter presented in sect .",
    "[ modelbeta ] .",
    "such a general law can be turned into a frequency or probability distribution .",
    "thus , the method suggests to consider a criterion of possibly optimal organization through the notion of relative distance to full disorder , i.e. , a ranking criterion of entity distributions based on the entropy ( section [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "section [ conclusions ] allows us to conclude and to offer suggestions for further research lines .",
    "in the context of best - fit procedures , rank - size theory allows to explore the presence of regularities among data and their specified criterion - based ranking @xcite .",
    "such regularities are captured by a best - fit curve . however , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotnogood9zmppwldexp ] , the main problem strangely resides in missing the distribution high rank tail behavior .",
    "no doubt , that this partially arises because most fit algorithms take better care of the high values ( on the @xmath6-axis ) than the small ones .",
    "more drastically , a cause stems in the large rank @xmath5 tail which is usually supposed to extend to infinity , see eq .",
    "( [ pwlwithcutoff ] ) , but each system is markedly always of finite size .",
    "therefore , more complicated laws containing a power factor , like the stretched exponential or exponential cut - off laws should be considered inadequate .",
    "we emphasize that we are in presence of data which often exhibits an inflection point .",
    "the presence of an inflection point means that there is a change in the concavity of the curve , even if the slope remains with the same ( negative ) sign for the whole range .",
    "thus , one could identify two regimes in the ranked data , meaning that the values are clustered in two families at a low and high ranks . in such cases ,",
    "the finite cardinality @xmath7 of the dataset leads to a collapse of the upper regime at rank @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , the yule - simon distribution @xcite , @xmath9 could be arranged in an appropriate way , according to a taylor expansion as in @xcite .",
    "( [ pwlwithcutoff ] ) can be then rewritten as @xmath10 as discussed by martinez - mekler et al .",

    "[ fig : plotliloncp3f ] .",

    "the rank - size relationship appears to follow a flipped noid function around some horizontal mirror or axis .",
    "notice that similar behaviors are observed for different years , although the number of @xmath0 yearly differs .",
    "incidently , note that , in this recent time , the official data claims a number of 103 provinces in 2007 , with an increase by 7 units ( bt , ci , fm , mb , og , ot , vs , in conventional notations ) thereafter , leading to 110 provinces .",
    "the number of municipalities has also been changing , between 2009 and 2010 , whence the rank of a given province is not constant over the studied years .      in view of taking into account a better fit at low and high rank",
    ", one can generalize eq .",
    "( [ lavalette3a ] ) to a five parameter free equation    @xmath16    where the parameter @xmath17 takes into account mandelbrot generalization of zipf s law at low rank , see eq .",
    "( [ zmeq3 ] ) , while @xmath18 allows some flexibility at the highest rank .",
    "in particular , the shape of the curve in eq .",
    "( [ lavalette5 ] ) is very sensitive to the variations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as the parameter @xmath17 increases",
    ", the relative level of the sizes at high ranks is also increased .",
    "this means that the presence of outliers at high ranks is associated to high values of @xmath17 .",
    "if one removes such outliers from the dataset and implements a new fit procedure , one obtains a lower level of the calibrated @xmath17 and a flattening of the curve at low ranks . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have found something similar in a different context ; they have denoted the major ( upsurging ) outlier at rank @xmath19 by `` king '' and called the other outliers at ranks @xmath20 as `` viceroys '' .",
    "the removal of outliers necessarily leads to a more appealing fit , in terms of visualization and @xmath21 , when such a procedure is implemented through power laws . in this respect , the introduction of a further parameter",
    "@xmath17 , in this case  serves as adjustment term at high ranks , and represents an improvement of the previous theory .",
    "indeed , the parameter @xmath18 acts analogously to @xmath17 , but at a low rank . in particular , an increase of @xmath18",
    "is associated to a flattening of the five parameter curve of eq .",
    "( [ lavalette5 ] ) at medium and low ranks .",
    "such a flattening is due to sizes at low ranks which are rather close to those at medium ranks .",
    "this phenomenon has been denoted in @xcite as `` queen '' and `` harem '' effect , - to have in mind the corresponding `` king '' and `` viceroys '' effects at low ranks .",
    "the queen and harem effect is responsible of the deviations of the power law from the empirical data at a low rank .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath18 also constitutes an adjustment term at low ranks and is an effective improvement of the performance of the fitting procedure .",
    "substantially , the specific sense of @xmath18 should be also read in terms of `` generalization '' and `` in view of best fit '' .",
    "usually , one is not sure about the 0 at the origin of axes .",
    "our @xmath17 corresponds to the @xmath22 of mandelbrot ( see eq . ( [ zmeq3 ] ) ) , for which mandelbrot gives no interpretation : it is only a mathematical trick .",
    "thus , by `` symmetry '' , we introduce a @xmath18 at high rank .",
    "it allows some flexibility due to possible sharp decays , due to outliers at high ranks .",
    "this also allows to move away from strict integers , and open the functions to continuous space as done in sect .",

    "indeed , such an assumption contrasts with the availability of resources , and the growth of the number of settlements is then bounded .",
