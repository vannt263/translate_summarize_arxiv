    "water is one of the most important liquids in the world .",
    "its relevance to life and to the industrial processes are a consequence of many of its anomalous properties .",
    "one example is the density anomaly .",
    "while for most liquids density decreases monotonically as temperature increases at constant pressure , this is not the case of liquid water",
    ". for high temperatures the density decreases with the increase of temperature , but at approximately @xmath0 at @xmath1 atm density reaches a maximum and decreases monotonically @xcite .",
    "this water property is responsible for keeping the water liquid inside lakes and rivers at subzero temperatures while the surface is frozen .",
    "this is one of the 70 known water anomalous properties @xcite .",
    "another peculiar water behavior is that it can diffuse faster in a more dense state . for normal liquids",
    "we expect that the diffusion coefficient , @xmath2 , at constant temperature increases with the decrease of pressure , since mobility is enhanced in a less dense medium . however , for water there is a range of pressures in which diffusion exhibits a non monotonic behavior with pressure and it increases as water gets more dense @xcite . + the diffusion coefficient of water exhibits another anomalous behavior : it changes from a non - arrhenius diffusion to an arrhenius diffusion when temperature is decreased at constant pressure in the region of pressure _ vs _ temperature phase diagram where the response functions have a large increase .",
    "water is fragile ( non - arrhenius ) at room and moderately supercooled temperatures @xcite , but has been shown to be a strong liquid ( with arrhenius behavior ) by dielectric relaxation measurements near the glass transition temperature @xcite for confined water .",
    "experiments using nmr and quasi - elastic neutron scattering @xcite and with nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite confirm the fragile - to - strong transition in the `` no - man s land '' .",
    "this is the region of the pressure _ vs _ temperature phase diagram where no liquid phase is found since homogeneous nucleation takes place .",
    "however , crystallization can be avoid in confined systems .",
    "recently , the existence of a fragile - to - strong transition is associated with the presence of a liquid - liquid transition as follows .",
    "experiments and simulations show that a fragile - to - strong transition occurs when the continuation of the liquid - liquid phase transition , the so called widom line , is crossed at constant pressure @xcite .",
    "+ water can form hydrogen bonds and this interaction between molecules has been considered the main mechanism for anomalies @xcite . due to the hydrogen bonds water molecules organizes themselves into arrangements of four bonded molecules , the tetramers .",
    "they can form two types of structures , one more rigid and open in which all molecules are bonded and another more malleable and close in which only part of the molecules are bonded .",
    "these two structures are present in the formation of hydrogen bond network in percentages that vary .",
    "while the open structure occupies less volume and requires less pressure , the closed structure has lower energy .",
    "this competition is responsible for the density and diffusion anomaly @xcite and to the reentrant multiple solid phases @xcite .",
    "+ recognizing that the competition between two structures is related to the mechanism for the presence of anomalies , a number of effective two length scales models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of these models is based on the lattice gas structure @xcite . in these cases",
    "the directionality of the hydrogen bonds is incorporated to the occupation variable with the addition of an arm variable @xcite and in some cases with the ad hoc increase of volume when the arm values are ordered @xcite .",
    "recently a couple of lattice models have been proposed in which no arm variable is presented . instead of the directionality",
    "the anomalies of water are obtained by the competition between two length scales : one attractive and one repulsive @xcite . in both models",
    "the presence of attraction is fundamental for the existence of anomalies .",
    "the existence of density and diffusion anomalies in lattice models with no directionality indicates that the anisotropy in this system is not fundamental for the existence of these anomalies .",
    "then the question arises if the attractive interaction is relevant or not for a system to exhibits anomalies . in order to answer to this question ,",
    "in this paper we study the phase diagram of a triangular lattice gas model that presents only repulsive interactions : a infinity repulsive hard - core interaction with the nearest neighbors and a finite repulsive interaction with the next to nearest neighbors .",
    "our basic assumption is that these two repulsive length scales can reproduce a competition between two ordered structures as presented in water , that we believe is responsible for the anomalies .",
    "hence , we test if this model exhibits the density and diffusion anomalies .",
    "in addition we also verify if in the vicinity of the anomalous region multiple liquid phases are presented .",
    "finally we also verify if the criticality is followed by a dynamical fragile - to - strong transition , particularly in the vicinity of the diffusion anomalous region in the chemical potential _",
    "vs _ temperature phase diagram .",
    "+ this article is divided in sections as follow . in section 2",
    "we present the model , in section 3 the monte carlo simulations are described . in section",
    "4 results are shown and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we considered a two dimensional triangular lattice gas model with @xmath3 sites . each lattice site",
    "thus can be empty or occupied by a particle , has six nearest neighbors with a distance @xmath4 and six next to nearest neighbors with distance @xmath5 where @xmath4 is the length scale of the model .",
    "the particles interact by a two - scale repulsive potential : an infinite repulsive hard core interaction with its nearest neighbors and a finite repulsive interaction @xmath6 with its next to nearest neighbors . therefore",
    ", if a site is occupied , its six nearest neighbors must be all empty and this particle will interact with its six next to nearest neighbors if they are occupied too @xcite .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian for this model can be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 indicates the interaction of next to nearest neighbor pairs of sites . if a site @xmath9 is empty @xmath10 , and",
    "if it is occupied : @xmath11 and @xmath12 for nearest neighbors and @xmath13 for the next to nearest neighbors . in the grand canonical ensemble , we can write an effective hamiltonian , namely @xmath14 and the grand potential will be defined as :    @xmath15    this model was originally proposed by almarza _",
    "et al _ @xcite and the full phase diagram was obtained by an improved mean field approach and simulations .",
    "+ at @xmath16 it is possible to observe three different structures , depending on the value of the chemical potential @xmath17 . for negative values of chemical potential ,",
    "the grand potential is minimal for the empty lattice , so we classified it as a gas phase . for intermediate values of chemical potential ,",
    "positive but not too high , there is competition between the chemical potential and the free energy .",
    "+ the positive chemical potential tends to fill the lattice , but the energy , that is repulsive , tends to empty it . due to this competition , for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 )",
    "only the third - nearest neighbors are occupied , generating an organized structure where a quarter of the lattice is occupied and there is no interaction between pairs of next to nearest neighbors , because they do not exist .",
    "this phase is called @xmath20 @xcite . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the gas and the @xmath20 phases coexist at first order phase transition . for high enough chemical potential values , @xmath22",
    ", the chemical potential term is more relevant and the system is in its maximum occupation , where a third of the lattice is occupied and each particle has its six next to nearest neighbors occupied , and they interact repulsively .",
    "this phase is called @xmath23 @xcite . at @xmath24 the @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath23 phases coexist at a first order phase transition .",
    "figure [ redest3t4 ] illustrates the phases @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "+    as the temperature is increased a new disordered phase appears . in order to understand the behavior of this model for different chemical potential and temperature conditions , we made use of numerical tools , such as monte carlo simulations . in the next section",
    "we describe the method used to study this model .",
    "in order to obtain the chemical potential _ vs _ temperature phase diagram and the density at all state points , monte carlo simulations , particularly the grand canonical monte carlo algorithm ( gcmc ) @xcite was used .",
    "systems with size @xmath25 were analyzed .",
    "equilibration times were @xmath26 monte carlo steps . + in order to find the order of the transitions the energy fourth order cumulant of energy  @xcite was computed : @xmath27 this fourth order cumulant identifies a first - order transition for a negative peak in the @xmath28 value and a continuous transition for a @xmath28 that vanishes at the criticality . usually in this case",
    "the transition is in between a small positive peak and a small negative peak . considering these tools , it was possible to obtain the chemical potential _",
    "vs _ temperature phase diagram .",
    "the monte carlo method is considered atemporal , however , in order to analyze the dynamical properties for this model , we considered each monte carlo step as a time unit . in order to calculate diffusion in this model using a monte carlo simulation , we employed a two - stages simulation . in the first part , using the grand canonical ensemble , the simulation started with fixed temperature and chemical potential .",
    "it was initialized and iterated until its equilibrium state was reached at @xmath29 equilibration time .",
    "then , in a second stage , in the nvt ensemble , we fixed the equilibrated number of particles and we observed how the particles diffuse inside the lattice as a function of time ( monte carlo steps ) .",
    "+ therefore , for a fixed temperature and number of particles , at the @xmath30 ensemble , at each monte carlo step the following procedure was repeated @xmath31 times , where @xmath31 is the number of particles in the lattice .",
    "a particle of the @xmath31 occupied sites is chosen randomly .",
    "next one of the six nearest neighbors is chosen .",
