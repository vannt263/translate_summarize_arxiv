    "<S> pattern formation often occurs in spatially extended physical , biological and chemical systems due to an instability of the homogeneous steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the type of the instability usually prescribes the resulting spatio - temporal patterns and their characteristic length scales . </S>",
    "<S> however , patterns resulting from the simultaneous occurrence of instabilities can not be expected to be simple superposition of the patterns associated with the considered instabilities . to address this issue we design two simple models composed by two asymmetrically coupled equations of non - conserved ( swift - hohenberg equations ) or conserved ( cahn - hilliard equations ) order parameters with different characteristic wave lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns arising in these systems range from coexisting static patterns of different wavelengths to traveling waves . </S>",
    "<S> a linear stability analysis allows to derive a two parameter phase diagram for the studied models , in particular revealing for the swift - hohenberg equations a co - dimension two bifurcation point of turing and wave instability and a region of coexistence of stationary and traveling patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dynamics of the coupled evolution equations is investigated by performing accurate numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these reveal more complex patterns , ranging from traveling waves with embedded turing patterns domains to spatio - temporal chaos , and a wide hysteretic region , where waves or turing patterns coexist . for the coupled cahn - hilliard equations </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an weak coupling is sufficient to arrest the coarsening process and to lead to the emergence of purely periodic patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the final states are characterized by domains with a characteristic length , which diverges logarithmically with the coupling amplitude .    * some chemical and biological systems exhibit competing pattern forming instabilities with different characteristic wave numbers </S>",
    "<S> . often such a phenomenon is caused by the presence of different physical processes that appear on different length scales and cause patterns with different wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> here , we investigate two coupled swift - hohenberg ( ch ) equations as well as two coupled cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equations as minimal models for such multiscale pattern formation . </S>",
    "<S> the ch and the sh equations are partial differential equations describing the evolution of a conserved and a a non - conserved order parameter , respectively . while the spatial domains in the sh equation self - organize into stationary periodic structures , for the ch equation the domains exhibit a coarsening dynamics that finally yield a single large domain . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between two instabilities with different wavelengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 is analyzed for coupled sh equations as well as for coupled ch equations . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of equations with stationary instabilities ( turing or phase separation ) can lead to wave dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , coupled sh equations exhibit a region of coexistence of turing and traveling patterns as well as more complex patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of two ch equations leads to the arrest of coarsening and to the emergence of spatially periodic patterns . * </S>"
