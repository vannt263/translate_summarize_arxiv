    "the existence of the black hole horizon is essential to the hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the horizon causes an extremely large redshift on an outgoing wave of a matter field during propagating from a vicinity of the horizon to the asymptotically flat region .",
    "this redshift results in the planckian distribution of quantum mechanically created particles at the future null infinity .",
    "although the hawking radiation has not yet been confirmed observationally , it has been pointed out that the similar phenomenon appears on phonons in a transonic flow of a fluid .",
    "this theoretical phenomenon in the fluid is called the sonic analogue of hawking radiation , and the transonic fluid flow on which the sonic analogue of hawking radiation occurs is called the acoustic black hole @xcite . in the transonic flow , the boundary between a subsonic and a supersonic region is the sonic point .",
    "the sonic point corresponds to the black hole horizon and called the sonic horizon .",
    "the region apart form the sonic point in the subsonic region corresponds to the asymptotically flat region in a black hole spacetime .",
    "the sound wave which propagates from a vicinity of the sonic point to the subsonic region receives the extremely large redshift and the sonic analogue of hawking radiation appears on phonons .",
    "the hawking temperature @xmath0 of the acoustic black hole is given by the gradient of the fluid velocity at the sonic point @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the sound velocity and the fluid velocity , respectively .",
    "for an ordinary system with typical size @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m / s , we obtain @xmath7 k. thus , in a practical experiment in a laboratory , it is very difficult to detect the sonic analogue of hawking radiation with such an extremely low temperature .",
    "while it is very hard to detect the sonic analogue of hawking radiation on phonons , which is a quantum origin , a classical sound wave with a sufficiently large amplitude can be available for detecting the effect of the acoustic black hole on a propagation of sound waves in practical experiments .",
    "indeed , the thermal nature of hawking radiation is not a quantum origin ; it comes from a large redshift on the wave propagating from a vicinity of the horizon to the asymptotically flat region , and has nothing to do with the quantum effect ( see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , if we can construct a classical quantity from sound waves which shows the thermal distribution , then such a quantity can be interpreted as a classical counterpart to hawking radiation . a candidate for the classical counterpart",
    "has already been introduced in the references @xcite by using a fourier component of an outgoing wave from a vicinity of the horizon .    by the way , since a realistic fluid is composed of molecules , the effect of the molecule size discrepancy of the fluid becomes one of the important issues of the acoustic black hole .",
    "this effect appears in the modified dispersion relation at high energies of phonons .",
    "however , in the expansion by the molecule size discrepancy , the zeroth order form of the quantum expectation value of the number operator @xmath8 of phonons results in the thermal spectrum at least not so high energy region .",
    "that is , the effect of the molecule size discrepancy is not dominant in the sonic analogue of hawking radiation . therefore , before proceeding to the issue of the molecule size discrepancy , it is necessary to detect the ordinary hawking radiation ( thermal spectrum ) by a real experiment in laboratory , and the molecule size discrepancy is not in the scope of this paper .",
    "hence we concentrate on the construction of the practical procedure to extract the evidence of the hawking radiation ( thermal spectrum ) from the experimental data .",
    "to do so , we make use of the classical counterpart to hawking radiation",
    ".    we should emphasize here that the hawking temperature ( [ eq : h - temp ] ) includes the planck constant @xmath9 and we can not consider the temperature @xmath0 in discussing the `` classical '' counterpart to hawking radiation .",
    "however we can consider the surface gravity @xmath10 of the black hole horizon which is a purely classical quantity and relates to the hawking temperature as @xmath11 .",
    "hence , for the acoustic black hole , we consider the surface gravity @xmath12 of the sonic horizon instead of the hawking temperature , @xmath13    in this paper , we aim to construct a practical procedure of the data analysis to obtain the classical counterpart to hawking radiation in a realistic setting of the acoustic black hole .",
    "to do so , we perform a numerical simulation of a fluid flow in a practical experimental setting , and demonstrate that our procedure works well to detect the classical counterpart to hawking radiation .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in the section [ sec :",
    "counterpart ] , we review the acoustic black hole in a laval nozzle and define the classical counterpart to hawking radiation . the section [ sec : numerical ] is devoted to the introduction of our numerical method to simulate a transonic flow , and to the construction of the practical procedure of the data analysis . in the section [ sec :",
    "result ] , our numerical results are presented and we determine the surface gravity of the sonic horizon .",
    "finally the summary and conclusion are in the section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider an acoustic black hole with a fluid in a laval nozzle as proposed in @xcite . the laval nozzle , as shown in the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] , has a throat where the cross section of the nozzle becomes minimum . the fluid is accelerated from the up stream to the down stream and the flow has the sonic point at the throat when a sufficiently large velocity is given at the inlet of the nozzle . even if we prepare an initial flow which has no sonic point ( e.g. the lower part of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] ) , the flow can settle down to a stationary transonic flow ( e.g. the upper part of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] ) with appropriate boundary conditions at the inlet and the outlet of the nozzle .",
    "this is the sonic analogue model which corresponds to the gravitational collapse .    here",
    "we note that , if a stationary transonic flow is prepared from the beginning ( which corresponds to the eternal black hole ) , we can not expect to obtain the classical counterpart to the hawking radiation ; for the eternal case , the tunneling of phonons across the sonic point can result in the hawking radiation and this is the purely quantum effect .",
    "hence , when we are interested in the `` classical '' counterpart to hawking radiation , it is necessary to consider the situation of the sonic point formation in course of the dynamical evolution of the fluid flow .",
    "as seen below , the sound wave which is prepared on the fluid flow before the formation of the sonic point becomes the classical counterpart to the quantum fluctuation which causes the classical counterpart to hawking radiation .",
    "we consider a perfect fluid and treat the flow in a laval nozzle as one dimensional for simplicity .",
    "the basic equations are the mass conservation equation and the euler equation :    [ eq : fluid ] @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 is the fluid velocity , @xmath17 is the pressure of the fluid and @xmath18 is the cross section of the laval nozzle .",
    "we assume the adiabatic ideal gas type equation of state @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the adiabatic index . the sound velocity @xmath3 is given by @xmath21 for a stationary background flow , we can obtain the sound velocity @xmath3 and the cross section @xmath22 of the nozzle as a function of the mach number @xmath23 of the flow : @xmath24 where quantities with subscript `` in '' represent the values at the inlet of the nozzle .",
    "the spatial derivative of the mach number at the sonic point @xmath25 is @xmath26 and this value relates to the surface gravity of the sonic horizon by eq .  .",
    "figure  [ fig : mach ] shows the structure of the stationary flow for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . here we set that the inlet is at @xmath29 , the throat at @xmath30 and the outlet at @xmath31 . that is , the fluid flows downward from @xmath29 to @xmath31 , then @xmath32 and fig .",
    "[ fig : mach ] shows the absolute value of @xmath33 .",
    "the boundary condition is given by the mach number @xmath34 at the inlet of the nozzle , and each line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mach ] corresponds to a different value of @xmath34 .",
    "the blue line which passes the sonic point @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 and represents the stationary transonic flow .",
    "for the case @xmath37 , we find @xmath38 and the surface gravity given by eq .",
    "is @xmath39 here it should be emphasized that , because the cross section of the nozzle is set @xmath28 with @xmath40 , the spatial scale is normalized by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the length of the nozzle , and that the temporal scale is normalized by @xmath43 , where we set @xmath44 .",
    "we have not considered the perturbation of the fluid flow so far . in the following sections , the perturbation ( sound wave )",
    "is introduced on the fluid flow , and the classical counterpart to hawking radiation is defined . then in the section  [ sec : result ]",
    ", we compare this surface gravity ( [ eq : temp - th ] ) with the surface gravity of the sonic horizon which is obtained through the observation of the classical counterpart to hawking radiation in our numerical simulation .    .",
    "each line represents the stationary solution of the flow with different boundary value @xmath45 .",
    "the blue lines represent transonic flows . ]",
    "as originally shown in the reference @xcite , the perturbation of the velocity potential for the transonic fluid flow obeys the same equation as a massless free scalar field in a black hole spacetime .",
    "therefore the classical counterpart to hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in the laval nozzle should be observed by the sound wave on the transonic fluid flow .",
    "the most important sound wave is the one which starts to propagate against the stream from the outlet of the nozzle before the formation of the sonic point ( the lower part of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] ) and passes through the throat just before the moment of the sonic point formation to reach the inlet of the nozzle ( the upper part of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] ) .",
    "this sound wave receives the extremely large redshift which will cause the classical counterpart to hawking radiation .",
    "when the fluid flow is irrotational and we introduce the velocity potential @xmath46 which relates with the fluid velocity as @xmath47 , the evolution equation of the perturbation @xmath48 of @xmath46 is obtained from eqs .",
    ", @xmath49\\left(\\frac{s\\,\\rho}{c_s^2}\\right)\\left[{\\partial}_t+v{\\partial}_x\\right]\\phi      -\\frac{1}{s\\,\\rho}{\\partial}_x\\!\\left(s\\,\\rho{\\partial}_x\\phi\\right)=0.\\ ] ] this corresponds to the klein - gordon equation @xmath50 with the acoustic metric @xmath51,\\ ] ] where the location of the sonic horizon ( sonic point ) @xmath1 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "here we should note that , because we consider the one dimensional flow along @xmath53-axis as mentioned at the beginning of the previous section [ sec : counterpart : basic - eq ] , the two dimensional section of @xmath54 coordinate is omitted in obtaining eq .   from @xmath50 . in the following analysis ,",
    "we omit the two dimensional section of @xmath54 coordinate .    in order to describe the extremely large redshift which causes the classical counterpart to hawking radiation , we introduce the following null coordinates for the first , @xmath55 and the acoustic metric becomes @xmath56 , which has a coordinate singularity at @xmath1 . in order to eliminate the coordinate singularity ,",
    "we introduce the new null coordinates @xmath57,\\quad     w=\\frac{1}{c_{s0}'+v_0'}\\exp\\left[(c_{s0}'+v_0')w\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and quantities with subscript @xmath59 denotes values at the sonic point @xmath1 .",
    "then the acoustic metric and the evolution equation of the perturbation @xmath48 become @xmath60\\,du\\,dw         \\equiv -f\\,du\\,dw , \\label{eq : metric2 } \\\\    \\square\\phi&=\\frac{1}{f}{\\partial}_{uw}\\,\\phi=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the form of this metric near the sonic horizon is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is used .",
    "this denotes explicitly that the coordinate @xmath63 does not have coordinate singularities and corresponds to the kruskal - szekeres coordinate of the schwarzschild spacetime . here",
    "it should be recalled that , in the spacetime of the gravitational collapse ( the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] ) , the kruskal - szekeres coordinate is appropriate to describe the rest observer at the spacetime region before the formation of the black hole @xcite .",
    "hence the outgoing normal mode of the sound wave which corresponds to the zero point fluctuation of the quantized matter field before the formation of the black hole ( i.e. the mode function on the flat spacetime ) is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the initial frequency and @xmath66 is the amplitude of this mode . in the original coordinate @xmath67",

    "one may think it is strange that the initial frequency @xmath65 does not appear in the power spectrum .",
    "it is the fact that the initial frequency @xmath65 does appear in the power spectrum in the context of the quantum field theory , because the amplitude @xmath66 is determined by the normalization condition for the mode functions to be @xmath76 .",
    "however , in the calculation for the classical counterpart to hawking radiation , the initial frequency @xmath65 appears only in the phase of the fourier component @xmath77 and the power @xmath78 does not explicitly depend on @xmath65 .",
    "the power spectrum has the planckian distribution for @xmath79 and this is the classical counterpart to the quantum hawking radiation @xcite . for the quantum hawking radiation , the magnitude of the power",
    "is determined by the zero point oscillation of the quantized field .",
    "however , for the classical counterpart to hawking radiation , the magnitude of the power depends on the amplitude @xmath80 of the input signal and it is expected that we can detect the thermal distribution of the power spectrum for the sound wave of a sufficiently large amplitude in practical experiments .",
    "as long as concerning one dimensional fluid flow , the amplitude of the sound wave does not decrease during propagating from the outlet to the inlet of the nozzle .",
    "the one dimensional transonic fluid flow corresponds to the two dimensional black hole spacetime in which no curvature scattering occurs .",
    "the theoretically expected power is equivalent to the formula of the hawking radiation for black holes derived ignoring the curvature scattering .",
    "our purpose is to observe this thermal spectrum via the numerical simulation of a transonic flow in the laval nozzle , and to construct the practical procedure of the data analysis . because the observable sound wave is a real valued one , we prepare the following real valued input mode at the outlet of the nozzle before the formation of the sonic horizon : @xmath81 , \\label{eq : real - input}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the initial phase of the wave , @xmath83 is given by eq .  , and @xmath84 is the location of the outlet of the nozzle .",
    "here we should note that , although the outlet of the nozzle is the `` exit '' of the background fluid flow , the sound wave can propagate against the background flow from the outlet to the inlet of the nozzle . then , since the amplitude of the sound wave on one dimensional fluid flow does not decrease , the input mode of eq .",
    "causes the following sound wave in the fluid flow , @xmath85.\\ ] ] the effect of the redshift due to the formation of the acoustic black hole gradually appears on the observed sound wave .",
    "the temporal evolution of the observed sound wave is affected by the formation of the acoustic black hole .",
    "that is , the information of the classical counterpart to hawking radiation is encoded in the observed sound wave .",

    "therefore , in order to obtain the planckian distribution in the power spectrum @xmath78 of the observed sound wave from real valued input signals , we have to combine at least two output modes of which the input phases differ by @xmath95 .",
    "our numerical simulation is designed to generate a one dimensional transonic fluid flow from the initial configuration with no sonic point .",
    "we prepare the input signal at the outlet of the nozzle and observe the sound wave at the inlet of the nozzle . at the same time , the practical procedure of the data analysis is constructed .      for the numerical calculation",
    ", we rewrite the fluid eqs .   using @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,    @xmath96    this set of equations is not suitable for a numerical simulation of wave propagation in a transonic flow .",
    "we transform these equations to the advection form .",
    "we introduce the riemann invariants @xmath97 as follows @xmath98 then the basic equations become    [ eq : num ] @xmath99    where @xmath100 the left hand side of eqs .",

    ", the perturbation of the velocity potential ( sound wave ) corresponds to the scalar field in a black hole spacetime as shown by eq .  .",
    "therefore , in a practical experiment of an acoustic black hole , we should calculate the velocity potential by integrating the observed velocity of the fluid : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the observation point of sound waves and @xmath109 defines the origin of the velocity potential .",
    "however , since our experimental setting is designed to observe the sound wave at a fixed spatial point @xmath110 , the observational data is a temporal sequence of @xmath111 and we must devise the other method to obtain the velocity potential at the observation point . in the upstream subsonic region of the transonic flow where the effects of the sonic horizon is negligible and the flow is stationary , the sound wave propagates along the `` null '' direction as indicated by eq .",
    "@xmath112 and we can obtain the value of the velocity potential at @xmath108 by integrating the velocity with respect to time @xmath113 where @xmath114 defines the origin of the potential .",
    "we use this formula to evaluate the velocity potential at the observation point .",
    "we use the laval nozzle with the cross section of the following form , @xmath115 we make the fluid flow against @xmath53-axis and assume @xmath116 .",
    "the inlet of the nozzle is at @xmath117 , the throat at @xmath118 and the outlet at @xmath119 .",
    "the input wave is prepared at the outlet of the nozzle and the wave propagates against the flow from @xmath119 to @xmath117 .",
    "after the flow settles down to a stationary transonic flow , since @xmath120 at the inlet , the set of eqs .",
    "gives @xmath121 at the inlet .",
    "this means that the inlet of the nozzle corresponds to the asymptotically flat region in the gravitational collapse spacetime .",
    "hence we make the observation of the sound wave at the inlet and set @xmath122 .",
    "we prepare a flow with a homogeneous velocity distribution as the initial configuration , @xmath123 this initial configuration of flow has no sonic point and corresponds to the flat spacetime region before the formation of a black hole .",
    "since our evolution equations are of the advection form , it is enough to set the boundary conditions for @xmath103 at the outlet and @xmath105 at the inlet : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a constant that represents the amplitude of the perturbation of @xmath103 at @xmath31 , and the values @xmath126 and @xmath127 are determined consistent with eq .   and eq .  .",
    "these boundary conditions mean that sound waves of constant amplitude continue to emerge from the outlet toward the inlet of the nozzle all the time of the numerical simulation . here",
    "recall that the perturbation @xmath48 of the velocity potential @xmath46 plays the role of the scalar field in the ordinary hawking radiation .",
    "the second term in @xmath128 at the outlet @xmath129 causes perturbations of the velocity potential and results in the classical counterpart of hawking radiation at the inlet of the nozzle .",
    "because the amplitude of the sound wave in one dimensional fluid flow does not decrease , the amplitude of the input mode of the velocity potential is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are respectively the sound velocity and the fluid velocity at @xmath29 , and the relation of the perturbations @xmath133 at the outlet is used ( see eqs .   and ) .    in order to extract the perturbation part @xmath48 from the `` full '' velocity potential @xmath46 of eq .   which includes the `` background '' flow of the fluid",

    "[ fig : final - mach2 ] .",
    "this discontinuity is due to the shock formed in the transonic flow .",
    "the formation of the shock is peculiar to our boundary condition which determines the riemann invariants @xmath190 at the inlet and the outlet of the nozzle .",
    "however , since the shock occurs in the supersonic region after the formation of the sonic point , the effect of the shock never propagate into the subsonic region after the formation of the sonic point .",
    "hence the shock never affect the sonic analogue of hawking radiation , and we do not have to pay attention to the effect of the shock formation .",

    "the second point is the deviation of the numerical power from the theoretical one in the high @xmath200 range .",

    "the input sound wave emerges from the outlet of the nozzle toward the inlet of the nozzle , and the observation is done at the inlet . before the formation of the sonic point , the input sound wave comes from the outlet to the inlet without receiving a large redshift .",
    "then , as the fluid flow evolves in time , the redshift on the observed sound wave becomes larger , and the observed frequency continues to decrease until the sonic point appears , as denoted by eq .  .",
    "hence , although the input sound wave is a monochromatic wave at the outlet of the nozzle ( the starting point of the propagation ) , the observed sound wave at the inlet of the nozzle has a broad power spectrum after the formation of the sonic point because of the stimulated effect of the redshift before the formation of the sonic point .",
    "the peak of this broad spectrum appears obviously in fig .",
    "[ fig : power3 ] around @xmath213 .",
    "this broadness in the power spectrum is the origin of the deviation of the numerical power from the theoretical one in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ]",
    ". the perfect thermal spectrum should be realized at the infinite future , and that the theoretical power spectrum is the form evaluated at the infinite future .",
    "however we have to make the observation in a finite temporal interval .",
    "therefore , when we plot the numerical result in an appropriately large range of @xmath200 , it is impossible to avoid some deviation of the numerical power from the theoretical one .",
    "if we carry out the numerical calculation longer and longer , a better agreement have to be obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] .    from above discussions",
    ", we conclude that fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] shows the good agreement between the numerically obtained power and the theoretically expected form of the classical counterpart to hawking radiation .",
    "for the acoustic black hole , the classical counterpart to hawking radiation is given by the power spectrum of the perturbation of the velocity potential of the fluid and detectable in practical experiments .",
    "to demonstrate its detectability , we performed the numerical simulation of the acoustic black hole in the laval nozzle and observed the classical counterpart to hawking radiation .",
    "we obtained the good agreement of the numerically observed power spectrum with the theoretically expected one .    through our numerical simulation ,",
    "we have obtained two noteworthy points for data analysis of the experiments of the acoustic black hole : the first one is that a single input wave can not give us necessary information of the classical counterpart to hawking radiation . we need to carry out several independent observations of the sound waves with different initial phases to retrieve the thermal distribution of the power spectrum .",
    "the second one is that we can evaluate the velocity potential at the observation point by integrating the fluid velocity at that point with respect to time ( see eq .  ) .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to observe the sound wave at every spatial points in the fluid .    in our calculation",
    "presented here , we have considered the sound wave with small amplitude .",
    "however our numerical code is applicable beyond perturbation , in which the non - linear effect of the sound wave becomes important . by analyzing such a situation , we may be able to discuss the backreaction effect on the classical counterpart to hawking radiation . as the next step",
    ", we are planning to extend our simulation of transonic flows in a laval nozzle to include quantum effects .",
    "then , we expect to obtain implications for quantum aspects of hawking radiation using the sonic analogue model of black hole .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to satoshi okuzumi and masa - aki sakagami .",
    "their numerical calculation of the perturbation equation ( not a full order calculation ) of the velocity potential was very impressive for us and we were led to refine our numerical simulation .",
    "we briefly review the hawking radiation in a spacetime of a gravitational collapse forming a schwarzschild black hole , and clarify the distinction between the quantum effects and the classical effects in the occurrence of the hawking radiation . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a massless free scalar field @xmath46 as a representative of the matter field , and set @xmath214 .",
    "for the first , we start with the classical effects . because the spacetime is dynamical ,",
    "the positive frequency modes and the negative frequency modes of the scalar field are mixed as the system evolves in time .",
    "this mixing is represented by the bogoliubov transformation between the positive frequency mode @xmath215 of @xmath46 at the past null infinity and that mode @xmath216 at the future null infinity @xmath217 \\ , , \\label{eq - cc.bogo.trans}\\ ] ] where @xmath218 is the negative frequency mode at the future null infinity .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath219 and @xmath220 are obtained by solving the classical wave equation @xmath221 with appropriate boundary conditions at the past and future null infinities and with the following relation , @xmath222 = \\delta_{{\\omega}_1{\\omega}_2 } \\,,\\ ] ] which comes from the normalization condition @xmath223 with respect to the klein - gordon inner product of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this means that the derivation of @xmath219 and @xmath220 is purely classical .",
    "next , in the classical framework , we consider the wave mode which propagates from the past null infinity to the future null infinity via a vicinity of the black hole horizon ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nozzle ] ) .",
    "this wave mode is ingoing at the past null infinity and becomes outgoing at the future null infinity . the ingoing positive frequency mode @xmath215 at the past null infinity",
    "is given by @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the ingoing null coordinate appropriate for the rest observer at the past null infinity .",
    "when this wave mode @xmath226 propagates to the future null infinity via a vicinity of the horizon , it evolves to be @xmath227 at the future null infinity under the geometrical optics approximation , where @xmath228 is the outgoing null coordinate appropriate for the rest observer at the future null infinity .",
    "the function @xmath229 expresses the extremely large redshift which the mode @xmath226 receives during propagating from the past null infinity to the future null infinity .",
    "this redshift effect can be decomposed into two parts : one is the redshift during the propagation from the past null infinity to the vicinity of the horizon , and the other part is the redshift after passing through the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "the first contribution is not so large and the mixing of positive and negative frequency modes does not occur .",
    "however , the second contribution is large enough to make the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath230 non zero . by",
    "matching the null coordinates @xmath225 and @xmath228 along a null geodesic which connects the past and future null infinities via the vicinity of the horizon , the function @xmath229 is obtained @xcite : @xmath231 where @xmath10 is the surface gravity of the black hole horizon , @xmath232 is an arbitrary constant denoting the freedom of choosing the origin of @xmath225 , and the constant @xmath233 is determined by the first part of the redshift .",
    "the exponential form @xmath234 in the eq",
    ".   comes from the second part of the redshift and implies that the wave length of the outgoing wave is exponentially stretched during propagating from a vicinity of the horizon to the future null infinity .",
    "that is , the wave @xmath227 is no longer a pure positive frequency mode but becomes a superposition of positive and negative frequency modes at the future null infinity . in order to calculate the superposition , we need the outgoing positive frequency mode @xmath235 at the future null infinity : @xmath236 then , using the definition of the bogoliubov transformation , the wave @xmath237 at the future null infinity is decomposed as @xmath238",
    ". \\label{eq - cc.mode.future}\\ ] ] the bogoliubov coefficients are obtained using the inner product @xmath239 and @xmath240 , and we find @xmath241 the square of the bogoliubov coefficients do not depend on the constants @xmath233 and @xmath232 , and the following relation holds : @xmath242 all the above phenomena are the classical effects .",
    "finally we proceed to the quantum effects . when @xmath46 is quantized , the harmonic operators @xmath243 and @xmath244 with respect to the past mode @xmath215 are related to those @xmath245 and @xmath246 with respect to the future mode @xmath235 as follows@xcite : @xmath247=\\hbar\\,\\delta_{\\omega_1\\omega_2},\\quad [ \\tilde a_{\\omega_1},\\tilde a^{\\dagger}_{\\omega_2}]=\\hbar\\,\\delta_{\\omega_1\\omega_2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the number of particles at the future null infinity is obtained @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the vacuum state at the past null infinity , @xmath250 .",
    "therefore , for the mode @xmath215 which passes a vicinity of the horizon and propagates to the future null infinity , using eqs .   and an appropriate regularization method @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath251 it is concluded that a black hole emits a thermal radiation of @xmath46 with the hawking temperature @xmath252 .",
    "it should be emphasized that , although the creation of particles is just the quantum effect , however the planckian distribution ( [ eq-cc.hr ] ) of the emitted particles is purely the classical effect due to eqs .  .",
    "the thermal nature of the spectrum comes from the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath253 which has the planckian distribution with respect to @xmath254 .",
    "that is , the thermal nature of the hawking radiation comes from the extremely large redshift for the wave mode @xmath215 which passes the vicinity of the horizon . if we take the classical limit @xmath255 , the number of created particles and the hawking temperature become zero but @xmath256 is not affected ."
