    "the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) of the milky way galaxy were discovered over 40 years ago by @xcite , and have been extensively studied in  emission ,  emission , and absorption , but their nature remains puzzling .",
    "these clouds of  gas , deviating from the disk velocity by up to 300 , exhibit a tremendous variation in size , morphology and velocity .",
    "the largest complexes span many degrees on the sky and possess complicated spatial structure , while the compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs ; * ? ? ? * ) are of small angular extent .",
    "the distances to the hvcs remain largely unknown , except for a few with direct determinations ( _ e.g. _ , absorption against background halo stars , * ? ? ? * ) or indirect determinations ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a number of formation theories posit either galactic or extragalactic origins for the hvcs , predicting different physical and dynamical properties . among the galactic models ,",
    "the most favored is the galactic fountain , a cyclic phenomenon whereby hot ( @xmath0 k ) gas is ejected by supernova explosions into the lower halo , where it cools and falls back down as observable  @xcite .",
    "models which point to an extragalactic origin include stripping from companion galaxies , accretion from the inter - galactic medium ( igm ; _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a population of gaseous , dark - matter - dominated mini - halos , either concentrated within @xmath1 kpc of our galaxy or scattered throughout the local group ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the inferred mass of a 21cm - emitting  cloud goes as the distance squared , the mass distribution of the hvc ensemble is quite different under the various scenarios , as summarized in table [ tab : scenarios ] .",

    "mass depends on distance , however , and hvc distance is difficult to determine for clouds of primarily neutral hydrogen .",
    "this problem can be largely overcome by observing external galaxies of known distance and of similar type to the milky way .",
    "evidence of anomalous  sources in spiral galaxies has been observed for over a decade ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a recent study has revealed for the first time an extensive population of discrete  clouds around an external galaxy ( m31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this contribution describes the first results of a study of nearby spiral galaxies to search for hvc counterparts and other anomalous .",
    "deep vla observations of m 83 and m 51 have revealed several discrete  sources .",
    "comparison of the derived source mass distributions to the expected galactic hvc distribution allows us to discriminate between the various hvc production scenarios .",
    "full details of the analysis are presented by @xcite and in papers currently in preparation .",
    "the project requires observations of large , late - type spiral galaxies located nearby to increase  mass sensitivity and spatial resolution . orientation effects limit the visibility of anomalous clouds ; while edge - on galaxies allow discrimination of features in the galactic @xmath15 direction , nothing can be known about the @xmath15 velocity .",
    "in contrast , galaxies viewed face - on reveal vertical velocity structure , but line - of - sight positions are degenerate , and high-@xmath15 sources merge with the disk emission if they are sufficiently low in @xmath15 velocity .",
    "inclined galaxies avoid these effects to some extent , as has been demonstrated with ngc 2403 ( * ? ? ? * and elsewhere in these proceedings ) , although the parameter space probed is somewhat lessened . overcoming these degeneracies",
    "requires a sample covering a range of inclinations .",
    "we have begun this project by observing two bright , nearby , face - on spiral galaxies , m 83 and m 51 .",
    "the  21-cm emission line observations were taken in 1999 with the vla in d array , with a spatial resolution of about 40 , an effective bandwidth of @xmath16  ( centered on the systemic velocity ) , and a velocity resolution of 5.2  after processing .",
    "the primary beam hpbw of 30  provided an effective field of view of diameter 40 kpc for m 83 ( 4.5 mpc distant ) and 75 kpc for m 51 ( 8.4 mpc distant ) .",
    "the dirty image cubes , with effective exposure times of about 12 hr , were deconvolved with the multi - resolution clean of @xcite .",
    "deep optical observations were taken with the curtis schmidt telescope ( m 83 , in 1999 ) and mdm 1.3 m telescope ( m 51 , in 2002 ) to search for stellar streams associated with anomalous .",
    "the inner regions of both galaxies exhibit  structure and kinematics typical of spiral galaxies , with a central hole in the  distribution and a `` spider diagram '' velocity map ( see figure [ fig : moments ] ) .",
    "both galaxies also contain  well outside of the optically - defined disk , with 80% of the  in m 83 found here @xcite and with m 51 exhibiting long arcs of  emission unassociated with starlight ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while these are extreme cases , spiral galaxies often possess extended disks of .",
    "removal of the thin , kinematically cold  disk is helpful in searching for anomalous material .",
    "we did this by fitting a gaussian to the peak of the velocity profile along every line - of - sight in the data cube and subtracting this model .",
    "the residual cube contained  projected on the disk but at much different velocities , as well as  emission found in the wings of the disk profile . a position - velocity ( ) cut for the full m 83 data cube and the residual cube",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : beard ] with the slice taken along the major axis ( as shown in figure [ fig : moments ] ) .",
    "measurable  is found in the residual cube at velocities between systemic and the rotation velocity .",
    "the total intensity map of the residual cube shows that this material is structured into a clumpy disk , and a map of the difference between the mean disk velocity and the mean residual  velocity shows that it is rotating in the same sense as the thin disk , but 4050  more slowly in projection ( see figure [ fig : beard ] ) . if the rotation axes of the two components are aligned , then the anomalous  is rotating at about 100 , or half the speed of the thin disk",
    ". the total  mass of this extended feature is 6 , about 1% of the total  mass of the galaxy .",
    "m 51 shows a similar anomalous disk containing about 3% of the total  mass .",
    "the slowly rotating anomalous  disk is similar to features seen in ngc 891 and ngc 2403 . in the former",
    ", @xcite found a vertically extended layer of  rotating 25100  more slowly than the thin disk . in ngc 2403 , @xcite identified the `` beard '' , a layer of  thought to be rotating 2050  more slowly than the thin disk .",
    "radio astronomy suffers from a lack of robust , statistical , 3-d source detection software . in response to this",
    ", we developed a suite of algorithms to search a data cube of semi - independent pixels ( as is the case for radio synthesis imaging ) , borrowing heavily from the methods developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the software applies a matched velocity filter to the data cube , enhancing velocity features with widths similar to the filtering kernel ( a gaussian ) .",
    "statistically significant peaks are identified and delineated into sources by a 3-d contouring scheme , down to some specified threshold .",
    "the bright  disk is subtracted and/or masked to prevent detection of the profile wings .    using this technique",
    ", we discovered 14 anomalous - velocity clumps ( avcs ) in m 83 and 23 avcs in m 51 .",
    "these discrete emission sources , shown in figure [ fig : moments ] , range from being unresolved to spanning several synthesized beams .",
    "some are projected over the stellar disk ( typically the extended ones ) , while some are found in regions free of starlight down to 27 r magnitudes per square arcsec ( typically the compact ones , although m 51 has several large  features at large radii ) .",
    "the  masses are calculated from the 21-cm luminosities , and these range from 5 to 1  with most in the  range .",
    "the deviation velocities range from 50  ( the lowest we can detect ) to 200",
    ".    some of these detections are likely spurious , and we can use the detection algorithm to determine the completeness and false discovery rate with simulated datasets . using noise and data cube characteristics similar to the real data",
    ", we simulated 9000 sources of nine different  masses and processed them with the detection software .",
    "all sources were detected down to a mass of 6  assuming a distance for m 83 ( 2  for m 51 ) .",
    "we constructed 400 data cubes of gaussian noise and processed them with the software to obtain the false discovery rate .",
    "several spurious sources were detected below 1 , with detections above 1.5  being real hvcs at the 95% confidence level for m 83 ( 5 for m 51 ) .",
    "three of the 14 avcs in m 83 and 15 of 23 avcs in m 51 are above this threshold and likely to be real .",
    "the mass distributions of the low - mass avcs were compared to the mass distribution of false detections with a k - s test .",
    "the m 83 avcs were found to be consistent with spurious detections ( k - s probability of 61% ) , while the m 51 avcs were inconsistent with purely false detections , to the 99% confidence level ( k - s probability of 1% ) . while nothing can be concluded about the verity of the m 83 detections , there is a statistically significant excess of low - mass sources in m 51 compared to what is expected by chance .",
    "knowledge of the hvc mass distribution in other galaxies allows us to constrain the mass distribution ( and more importantly the spatial distribution ) of the hvcs observed around our own galaxy .",
    "we must assume the hvc population of the milky way is similar to these other galaxies in mass , space , and kinematics .",
    "in addition , we must assume a spatial distribution for the galactic hvcs , and here we use a uniform spherical distribution for simplicity .",
    "using fluxes tabulated in the all - sky hvc catalog of @xcite , we construct expected mass distributions for a number of average hvc distances @xmath17 by randomly assigning distances to each avc .",
    "four such distributions are shown in figure [ fig : massdist ] along with the mass distribution for the m 83 hvcs , corrected for false detections . while the errors are large , the m 83 mass distribution is consistent with that of the milky way hvcs only if the average hvc distance is less than 25 kpc .",
    "if the milky way hvcs are much further away than that , and if the population is similar to that in m 83 , they would be generally more massive and we would have detected significant numbers in m 83 .",
    "discovery of a `` beard '' and limits on the hvc mass distribution in m 83 and m 51 constrain the formation models , but as one might expect , multiple scenarios remain viable , and perhaps required . under a galactic fountain , the slowly rotating and ( presumably )",
    "vertically - extended  disk would represent condensing material beginning to fall back on to the star - forming disk .",
    "the lagging rotation is in line with expectations of the model , as material ejected from the disk would flow outward in radius and slow in rotation . a possible radial inflow discovered by @xcite in ngc 2403",
    "supports this condensing argument as well .",
    "in addition , a simple estimate of the mass exchange rate from an assumed cooling time is @xmath18 yr@xmath19 , a value similar to the star formation rates of the galaxies under study .",
    "the discrete  sources are consistent with a galactic fountain .",
    "the on - disk hvcs , which are real sources of mass @xmath20  in both galaxies , could be condensed , free - falling clouds or cool gas entrained in superbubbles breaking out of the galaxy .",
    "the appearance of holes in the cold  disk at some of these locations @xcite supports the latter idea , unless the infalling clouds are sufficiently dense to punch through the disk .",
    "tidal stripping clearly is active in m 51 , with large tidal tails of and streams of stars .",
    "some of the hvc candidates to the west of m 51 might result from this as well , as it is difficult to reconcile these with a galactic fountain . the extended disk and arms of m 83 could be relics of a recent encounter , of which there is evidence in the form of a faint , arc - like optical companion @xcite .",
    "the other extragalactic scenarios remain viable , although this study has placed constraints on them . the anomalous  disk could be accretion from the igm ; metallicity estimates would be invaluable to determine this",
    ". the discrete avcs could be dark matter mini - halos , although we detect only a handful at the @xmath21  level .",
    "if they are about 50 kpc from the galaxy , we would have seen nearly five times as many detections in m 83 and m 51 .",
    "much farther than this , however , and many would have fallen outside of our field of view .",
    "one thing made clear by this meeting is that most galaxies are found to contain `` anomalous '' gas upon deep observation .",
    "warps , extended disks , and extra - planar clouds are typical of spiral galaxies , and it is the completely quiescent and regular systems that are the anomalies ."
