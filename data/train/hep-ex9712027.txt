    "now , 25 years on from the first developments of qcd , at the 25th slac summer institute we can discuss a series of diffractive measurements that have been made in the intervening period at hera and the tevatron .",
    "_ hera kinematics : _ the diffractive processes studied at hera are of the form : @xmath4 where the photon dissociates into the system @xmath5 and the outgoing proton , @xmath6 , remains intact , corresponding to single dissociation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the measurements are made as a function of the photon virtuality , @xmath7 the centre - of - mass energy of the virtual - photon proton system , @xmath8 , the invariant mass of the dissociated system , @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath9 and the four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , given by @xmath10 .",
    "= 8.cm    _ signatures of diffraction : _ the processes studied build upon the basic elastic scattering process @xmath11 which is constrained through the measurement of the corresponding total cross - section @xmath12  anything , via the optical theorem .",
    "the diffractive processes measured are then @xmath13 @xmath14 where the systems @xmath5 and @xmath15 have a limited mass compared to the overall energy available , @xmath16 .",
    "the process is thought of as being mediated by the exchange of an object with vacuum quantum numbers ( in particular , no colour is exchanged in the process ) .",
    "a signature for diffraction is via the momentum fraction carried by the exchanged colour singlet state .",
    "when this fraction is less than 1% of the momentum of , say , particle @xmath17 ( in the infinite momentum frame of @xmath17 ) we can interpret this as being largely due to pomeron exchange .",
    "the kinematics of producing two low - mass outgoing states ( @xmath5 and @xmath17 or @xmath5 and @xmath15 ) with a small momentum fraction exchanged between them therefore leads to a rapidity gap .",
    "the high energy available at hera provides a large rapidity span , @xmath18 , of @xmath19 12 units ( here , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a typical @xmath23  gev ) .",
    "a colour singlet exchange of reggeons ( dominating at lower @xmath16 ) and the pomeron ( dominating at higher @xmath16 ) can be used to interpret the data on single dissociation and double dissociation reactions .",
    "fluctuations from processes where colour is exchanged may also generate low - mass states .",
    "however , these will be exponentially suppressed : the ( poisson ) probability of @xmath24 producing a given particle in the rapidity gap @xmath25 when the two systems are colour connected is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mean particle density for a given @xmath25 interval .",
    "this exponential fall - off reflects the plateau in the corresponding ( non - diffractive ) multiplicity distribution as a function of @xmath28 which increases relatively slowly ( logarithmically ) with increasing @xmath16  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ tsps ] , the @xmath29 distributions of @xmath30 elastic scattering data are illustrated as a function of the longitudinal momentum ( @xmath31 ) of the outgoing proton transformed to a fixed - target rest frame .",
    "the patterns are similar to the diffraction patterns observed when light is scattered from an aperture and exhibit an exponential fall - off for values of @xmath29 below @xmath32  1  gev@xmath33 .",
    "this characteristic fall - off increases with increasing energy , a property known as shrinkage , and differs for different incident and outgoing systems . in order to characterise the @xmath29-dependence ,",
    "a fit to the diffractive peak is performed . in the most straightforward approach ,",
    "a single exponential fit to the @xmath29 distribution , @xmath34 for @xmath35gev@xmath33 is adopted .",
    "physically , the slope of the @xmath29 dependence in diffractive interactions tells us about the effective radius of that interaction , @xmath36 : if d@xmath37 , then @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "= 10.cm    _ regge trajectories : _ the subject of diffraction is far from new : diffractive processes have been measured and studied for more than thirty years  @xcite .",
    "their relationship to the corresponding total cross - sections at high energies has been successfully interpreted via the optical theorem and regge theory . at lower energies the colour singlet exchange of virtual mesons , called reggeons , contribute to the fall of the cross - section with increasing energy . at higher energies ,",
    "the introduction of an additional trajectory , known as the pomeron trajectory , with a characteristic @xmath40 and @xmath29 dependence is necessary  @xcite .",
    "the energy behaviour of the total cross - sections can then be described by the sum of two power - law dependences on the centre - of - mass energy , @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath16 is measured in gev , @xmath43 and @xmath28 is defined to be positive such that @xmath44 . here ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are the pomeron and reggeon intercepts ( i.e. the values of the parameters at @xmath29  =  0  gev@xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "a wide range of total cross - section data are used to determine the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath28 .",
    "the fall - off at low energy due to reggeon exchange constrains the value of @xmath48 .",
    "the slow rise of hadron - hadron total cross - sections with increasing energy indicates that the value of @xmath49 i.e. the total cross - sections increase as @xmath50 , although the @xmath3 data from cdf at two @xmath51 values indicate @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "recent fits using all @xmath30 and @xmath53 data are consistent with a value of @xmath54 which will be used here to characterise this behaviour  @xcite .",
    "= 8.cm    in a regge analysis ,",
    "the diffractive data are interpreted via exchanges with spin @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . at lower energies ,",
    "these correspond to reggeon ( i.e. approximately degenerate @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) exchanges . at the highest energies ,",
    "where the pomeron contribution dominates , the optical theorem relates the total cross - sections to the elastic , and hence diffractive , scattering amplitude at the same @xmath40 . in fig .",
    "[ regge ] , the trajectories , @xmath62 , are shown as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the diffractive data probe the region of negative @xmath29 . given the dominance of the pomeron contribution at large @xmath16 and an approximately exponential behaviour of the @xmath63 distribution with slope @xmath64 ,",
    "whose mean @xmath65 value is given by @xmath66 at the mean @xmath67 of a given data sample , the diffractive cross - section rise is moderated from @xmath68 to @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71gev@xmath72 reflects the shrinkage of the diffractive peak as a function of @xmath29 with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "the observed shrinkage of the diffractive peak therefore corresponds to a relative reduction of the diffractive cross - section with increasing energy .",
    "this value may be compared with the corresponding parameter @xmath73  gev@xmath72 for reggeon exchanges .",
    "_ maps of the pomeron : _ whilst these regge - based models gave a unified description of pre - hera diffractive data , this approach is not fundamentally linked to the underlying theory of qcd .",
    "it was anticipated that at hera and tevatron energies if any of the scales @xmath74 , @xmath9 or @xmath29 become larger than the qcd scale @xmath75 , then it may be possible to apply perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) techniques , which predict changes to this power law behaviour . qualitatively , the @xmath16 dependence could be ascribed to the rise of the gluon density with decreasing @xmath2 determined from the large scaling violations of @xmath76 , where @xmath2 is the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath77 .",
    "qcd factorisation into a long - timescale and short - timescale process , where this timescale is characterised by @xmath78 or @xmath79 or @xmath80 , leads to the following approaches .    * for exclusive final states , e.g. vector meson production , with a hard scale the approach is very simple @xmath81 i.e. two - gluon exchange where @xmath82 is the square of the gluon density of the proton at a representative value of @xmath2 and @xmath83 represents the hard scattering process .",
    "the rise of @xmath84 with decreasing @xmath2 , which constrains the gluon density , corresponds to an increase in the effective value of @xmath47 .",
    "this brings us from the regime of dominance of the slowly - rising  soft \" pomeron to the newly emergent ",
    "hard \" behaviour and the question of how a transition may occur between the two .",
    "the qcd expectation is that the cross - sections should approximately scale as a function of @xmath29 , corresponding to a weak dependence of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath29 and therefore a decrease of @xmath85 for the perturbative pomeron . * for inclusive diffraction with a hard scale @xmath86 i.e. leading - gluon exchange where @xmath87 is the gluon density of the proton",
    ", @xmath83 represents the hard scattering process and @xmath88 represents the hadronisation process . here",
    ", the final state with a leading proton is seen as a particular hadronisation process  @xcite . for processes involving one incoming hadron ,",
    "the above approaches can be tested and compared with experimental data .",
    "* finally , one can break the process down further and invoke regge factorisation where a flux of pomerons , @xmath89 lead to partons from the pomeron , @xmath90 , which interact and hadronise @xmath91    for processes involving two incoming hadrons , this approach has been generalised to @xmath92 where @xmath93 represents the partons from the hadron which has not diffractively dissociated .",
    "this regge factorisation approach can therefore be experimentally tested when diffractive data from hera and the tevatron are compared .    precisely where the regge - based approach breaks down or where pqcd may be applicable is open to experimental question .",
    "in addition , once we observe  hard \" diffractive phenomena , we can ask whether the pqcd techniques applied to inclusive processes also apply to these exclusive colour singlet exchange reactions .",
    "the emphasis is therefore on the internal ( in)consistency of a wide range of measurements of diffractive and total cross - sections . as an experimentalist navigating around the various theoretical concepts of the pomeron , it is sometimes difficult to see which direction to take and what transitions occur where  ( fig .",

    "similarly , the production cross - section can be explored as a function of @xmath74 , using a virtual photon probe .",
    "the observation of a significant fraction of events ( @xmath96 ) with a large rapidity gap between the outgoing proton and the rest of the final state in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has led to measurements of the internal structure of the pomeron .",
    "in addition , the leading proton spectrometer data , where the diffracted proton is directly measured , enable the @xmath29 distribution as well as the structure function to be determined simultaneously . these results are discussed in section  3 .",
    "studies of the hadronic final state in events with a large rapidity gap , including transverse energy flows , event shape distributions and high-@xmath97 jets , have been used to provide complementary information on this structure .",
    "also , the observation of rapidity gaps between jets , corresponding to large-@xmath29 diffraction , are presented in section  4 .",
    "many of these hadronic final state investigations were initiated at @xmath3 colliders . in section  5 ,",
    "the latest results from the tevatron on diffractive dijet and @xmath0 production , rapidity gaps between jets and first observations of hard double - pomeron exchange are presented .",

    "a recent review of the hera data can be found in ref  @xcite .",
    "the relevant components of the h1 and zeus detectors are the inner tracking chambers which measure the momentum of the decay products ; the calorimeters which allow identification of the scattered electron and are used in the triggering of photoproduced vector mesons ; and the outer muon chambers used to identify muonic decays of the @xmath103 and @xmath95 .",

    "photoproduction processes have been extensively studied in fixed - target experiments , providing a large range in @xmath16 over which to study the cross - sections .",
    "the key features are the weak dependence of the cross - section on @xmath16 , an exponential dependence on @xmath29 with a @xmath64 slope which shrinks with increasing @xmath16 and the retention of the helicity of the photon by the vector meson .    in fig .",

    "the soft pomeron does not describe @xmath310 diffractive data measured at hera . as the photon virtuality or the vector meson mass increase a new dependence on @xmath40 emerges . as we investigate the pomeron more closely",
    ", a new type of dynamical pomeron may begin to play a rle ; a dynamical pomeron whose structure is being measured in dis .",
    "these data are consistent with a partonic description of the exchanged object which may be described by pqcd .    the cross - sections for hard diffractive processes at hera can be compared to those observed at the tevatron .",
    "all data are consistent with a significant gluon contribution of the partons within the pomeron i.e. qcd factorisation appears to be observed .",
    "however , a universal pomeron flux does not describe the observed rates i.e. regge factorisation does not apply .",
    "this is qualitatively expected from qcd corrections to the rates , but the effects are large and non - perturbative .",
    "the experimental work focuses on extending the lever arms and increasing the precision in @xmath29 , @xmath9 , @xmath40 and @xmath74 in order to explore this new structure .",
    "before more precise tests can be made , further theoretical and experimental input is required to reduce the uncertainties due to non - diffractive backgrounds and proton dissociation as well as the treatment of @xmath204 and radiative corrections .",
    "the results presented in this talk are a summary of significant developments at hera and the tevatron in the study of diffraction .",
    "the financial support of the desy directorate and pparc allowed me to participate in this research , whilst based at desy , for which i am very grateful .",
