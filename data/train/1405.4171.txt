    "for two decades , investigations of intense laser pulses interacting with dielectrics have revealed key features in the nonlinear propagation of light and the relatively high robustness of irradiated materials .",
    "an intriguing phenomenon is the filamentation of powerful beams in transparent solids , stemming from the interplay between diffraction , chromatic dispersion , kerr self - focusing and generation of free carriers  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "an important issue is the accurate modeling of materials like silica glass ( sio@xmath3 ) , potassium dihydrogen phosphate ( kh@xmath3po@xmath4 or kdp ) and its deuterated analog ( kd@xmath3po@xmath4 or dkdp )  @xcite .",
    "routinely used in high - power laser systems devoted to , e.g. , inertial confinement fusion , these materials are exposed to intense radiation .",
    "the precise knowledge of their inherent ionization properties and of the nonlinear light - matter interaction is thus essential to understand how and where laser damage initiated by plasma generation takes place . in particular , the strong increase in laser intensity which occurs during filamentation can be a potential source of damage , because photo - induced ionization produces an electron plasma in the wake of the optical field .",
    "while sio@xmath3 glasses and kdp crystals are mostly exploited in the fusion context for nanosecond long pulses , laser - induced damage has recently been examined for shorter femtosecond pulses , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "one motivation is the understanding of the influence of precursor defects , which may locally generate non - uniform damage zones over nanometer sizes . in kdp",
    ", precursors are suspected to be connected with the proton transport in the hydrogen bond network , which induces defects , e.g. , oxygen vacancies , leading to hole trapping . for an accurate modeling of the interaction",
    "it is important to incorporate the particular band structure of kdp .",
    "for instance , it was recently shown that electronic _ states located in the band gap _ ( slg ) can serve as intermediate transition states to transfer carriers ( electrons ) from the valence band to the conduction band , and such transitions involve lower photon numbers than a direct multiphoton process  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the trapping rates increase with the laser excitation density , and hole trapping precedes electron trapping  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for silica glass , electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band are direct and the kinetics of electron trapping ( self - trapped excitons ) does not depend on the laser intensity .",
    "the goal of this paper is to compare the filamentation of 800-nm femtosecond pulses in silica and kdp .",
    "filamentation is an omnipresent phenomenon in high - intensity pulse propagation and hence of utmost importance for the understanding of possible laser induced damage . in particular , the maximum intensity occuring inside a material is given by the so - called clamping intensity , determined by the self - channeling dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , the clamping intensity in solids is not accessible by direct experimental measurements",
    ". therefore , estimates extracted from numerical simulations usually provide valuable information .",
    "this clamping intensity is an important parameter for the interaction of laser pulses with crystal defects  @xcite and possible dopants  @xcite .",
    "the quantitative reliability of simulation results crucially depends on the material models , in particular the accurate description of the free carrier densities .",
    "our selected ionization models consider either direct transitions from the valence band to the conduction band only ( silica ) or additional transitions due to the presence of slgs ( kdp ) .",
    "different photo - ionization descriptions are used , from the complete keldysh rate with tunnel ionization  @xcite to purely multiphoton ionization ( mpi ) rates .",
    "the growth of the electron density in the conduction band is limited by electron relaxation , whose associated time scale depends on the trapped - hole population and their ability to trap free electrons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] recalls the propagation model and ionization schemes , with emphasis on kdp crystals .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] compares the filamentation dynamics of short 50-fs pulses in silica glass and in kdp . despite the comparable size of band gaps in silica and kdp , we report significant differences in the ionization rates leading to three times higher clamping intensities in kdp and a longer plasma channel .",
    "the former effect is caused by a weak 5-photon ionization cross - section ; the latter is supported by transitions from the slg states . at the same time",
    ", we identify very similar spatio - temporal filamentation dynamics in both silica and kdp after rescaling the pulse power .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] examines longer pulses , for which we expect to enhance the impact of defect states over longer relaxation times , since the associated electron recombination time lies in the picosecond timescale .",
    "most of the filamentation characteristics for short pulses are , however , retrieved .",
    "we integrate the following axial - symmetric pulse propagation model for filamentation  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the propagation variable , @xmath7 is the retarded time in a frame moving with group velocity @xmath8 at center frequency @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the dispersion operator formally involving the derivatives @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath17 denotes the time - response function of the kerr nonlinearity , @xmath18  @xmath2 is the critical plasma density at 800  nm , and @xmath19 is the electron density produced in the conduction band .",
    "our modelling of the optical properties of fused silica follows ref .",
    "linear dispersion is included via the sellmeier formula @xmath20 ) = 1+\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^3 \\frac{b_j \\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-\\lambda_j^2 } , \\label{eq : sellsi}\\ ] ] whose parameters are summarized in table  [ table : sellmeier ] .",
    "we can evaluate the linear refraction index @xmath21 and the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) coefficient @xmath22 fs@xmath23/cm at wavelength @xmath24 nm .",
    "the response function @xmath25 contains a raman - delayed contribution with ratio @xmath26 , rotational delay time @xmath27 fs and resonance frequency @xmath28 fs@xmath29 .",

    "the choices of @xmath35  tw/@xmath0 and @xmath36  tw/@xmath0 are reasonable clamping intensities for silica and kdp , respectively ( see below ) .",
    "we can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] three characteristic intensity regimes . at relatively low intensities up to @xmath37  tw/@xmath0",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a , b ) ] electron densities in the conduction band of kdp are much higher than in silica thanks to the contributions of the slgs ( see red [ light gray ] and blue [ dark gray ] solid lines )",
    ". however , such density levels are not sufficient to stop kerr self - focusing . at higher intensities around @xmath35",
    "tw/@xmath0 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c , d ) ] we find that direct ionization from the valence band in silica becomes much more efficient , while contributions from the slgs in kdp saturate due to the limited densities of the defect states .",
    "electron densities in the conduction band of silica are then about 10 times higher than in kdp for this intermediate regime , and we will see below that they are sufficiently high to clamp the laser intensity around @xmath35  tw/@xmath0 in silica . at even higher intensities",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](e , f ) ] direct mpi from the valence band ( black dashed curve ) , even though the cross section @xmath38 is small , becomes the dominant transition process in kdp and elevates the conduction band densities for intensity clamping .",
    "we can notice from fig .",

    "we consider gaussian input pulsed beams with @xmath43  fs and @xmath44 m . because the filamentation dynamic intrinsically depends on the ratio of the input peak power over critical , we will compare simulation results for two energy values ensuring similar power ratios . since fused silica has a nonlinear kerr index @xmath45 about twice that of kdp ,",
    "this leads us to double the pulse energy content in kdp simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a , b ) shows the behavior of the maximum intensities versus propagation distance for pulse energies between @xmath46 and 2  @xmath47j , i.e , with powers up to seven times the critical power .",
    "first , we clearly observe that the maximum clamping intensity in kdp is about three times higher than in silica .",
    "this directly follows from comparing the ionization cross - sections .",
    "indeed , considering that above 50  tw/@xmath0 direct 5-photons transitions prevail in kdp , we can make use of the following easy estimate , valid in the mpi regime  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the photon number , to evaluate the clamping value @xmath50  tw/@xmath0 in kdp , assuming an efficient plasma defocusing over short times @xmath51  fs  @xcite .",

    "[ fig3](c , d ) is characterized by peak values in kdp being around twice those in silica ( e.g. , @xmath58 @xmath2 at @xmath59 cm for the most energetic pulses ) .",
    "also , this figure reveals the underlying action of the slg transition mechanisms : at low intensities @xmath60  tw/@xmath0 a postionization regime occurs in kdp after the main mpi range developing at distances @xmath61 cm . beyond this distance , a residual plasma channel of density @xmath62  @xmath2",
    "is maintained over a propagation length of 1  cm .",
    "pulses in kdp seem able to preserve a longer self - guided state , as is visible from the 1/e@xmath23 pulse diameter shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](e , f ) .",
    "moreover , the temporal on - axis dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](e , f ) evidence rapid dispersion of the pulse around each nonlinear focus , which is typical of normal dispersion in transparent solids  @xcite .",
    "strong dispersion takes place over @xmath63  cm in silica and @xmath64  cm in kdp ( @xmath65 ) . by using these distances as typical values for the dispersion length of self - focused pulses",
    ", we can expect occurrence of light structures as short as @xmath66  fs durations .",
    "as far as dissipation is concerned , we report energy losses in kdp higher ( @xmath67 ) than in silica ( @xmath68 ) , which are probably associated with higher clamping intensities and more ionization channels involved .    figures  [ fig4](a , b ) illustrate two snapshots of on - axis temporal profiles , detailing in particular those with maximum compression in time , i.e. , 6.4  fs at @xmath69  mm in silica ( 1  @xmath47j pulse energy ) and 6.2  fs at @xmath70  mm in kdp ( 2  @xmath47j pulse energy ) .",
    "corresponding high - frequency electric fields are presented as insets .",
    "we also report an already compressed waveform down to 7.1 fs in kdp at @xmath69 mm ( not shown ) .",
    "basically , the pulse temporal profile follows the well - known dynamic spatial replenishment scenario  @xcite relying on the formation of a two - peaked profile after refocusing of the rear pulse , once the latter has been anteriorily defocused by plasma generation .",
    "we can notice the shock structures occurring in the trailing edges of the pulses at the shortest distances , which signals a significant action of self - steepening .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table  [ table : para ] , ionization dynamics in kdp crystals feature low relaxation times , i.e. , free electron lifetimes extend over the picosecond range for the slg2 defect state transitions and even over almost 10 ps for direct mpi transitions and impact ionization .",
    "it is thus instructive to repeat the previous simulations for much longer pulses , in order to see whether the pulse length may interact with the different ionization channels in kdp .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates the same pieces of information as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but for a 500-fs gaussian pulse with same initial width and power ratios , i.e. , 5  @xmath47j energy in silica and 10  @xmath47j in kdp .",
    "comparable maximum clamping intensities , namely @xmath71  tw/@xmath0 in silica and @xmath72  tw/@xmath0 in kdp are retrieved .",
    "this finding is not suprising because the balance between kerr self - focusing and plasma defocusing is not determined by the initial pulse duration , but by the effective pulse length undergoing ionization at nonlinear focus .",
    "therefore , similar peak density values emerge near the first focus , i.e. , @xmath73 @xmath2 at @xmath74 cm .",
    "in contrast , the initial pulse duration affects the number of focusing - defocusing events , dispersion and the filament length .",
    "we report up to 15  @xmath75 losses in silica and @xmath76 in kdp over the main filament range , along which multiphoton absorption more severely decreases the pulse power as many time slices participate in the ionization process . from fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) we again retrieve an extended plasma channel in kdp ( @xmath77 @xmath2 ) that prolongs self - channeling at low intensities @xmath78  tw/@xmath0 [ fig .  [ fig5](b ) ] , as for the 50-fs pulses .",
    "the red dashed curve plots the peak intensity and electron density obtained when only accounting for the 5-photon mpi process in the ionization of kdp . as expected , we can see that the slg contributions are crucial for supporting this extended plasma range .",
    "figure  [ fig5](e , f ) details the on - axis pulse dynamics for the two materials .",
    "each focusing - defocusing event spans a dispersive sequence extending over slightly longer distances , which does not prevent the pulse from reaching very short durations after several splitting events .",

    "long pulses decay into multi - peaked structures along the optical path , some of which can reach fwhm durations as short as 5.6 fs at @xmath80 mm in silica and 5.3 fs at @xmath70 mm in kdp .",
    "such self - compression events are expected to produce important supercontinuum generation .",
    "figure  [ fig7](a , b ) presents maximum spectral broadenings reached by the 50-fs and 500-fs pulses in silica and their counterparts in kdp .",
    "close to the peak intensities , strong plasma generation and self - steepening effects blueshift the wings of the spectra  @xcite .",
    "note the strong blueshifts caused by steep trailing edges  @xcite and oscillations in the spectra , which come from the development of multiple peaks in the temporal profiles  @xcite .     and as solid curves in fig .",

    "furthermore , enhancing the input pulse length does not proportionally increase the influence of collisional ionization , as the most intense pulse peaks are supported by very short optical structures @xmath82 fs .",
    "despite the fact that collisional time in kdp is 5 times greater than that in silica , we indeed checked that impact ionization does not alter the overall electron density by more than @xmath83 @xmath75 in silica and by @xmath84 @xmath75 in kdp near their first nonlinear focus .    to end with",
    ", we also did not observe significant differences in the fluence evolution [ @xmath85 in silica or in kdp ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "typically , 50-fs pulses in kdp reach the maximum fluence level of 2  j/@xmath0 and about half this value in silica . using 10 times longer pulses",

    "@xcite , we expect ablation processes to start at fluences close to 4 j/@xmath0 with @xmath87-fs 800-nm pulses",
    ". this damage threshold can only be very locally attained with our long pulses and remain unexceeded with the short ones .",
    "the same conclusion applies to fused silica , for which , according to fig .",
    "@xcite and related definition of damage thresholds , the fluence threshold is @xmath88 j/@xmath0 for 50-fs pulses and about 5 j/@xmath0 for 10 times longer pulses .     and fig . [ fig5 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated numerically the influence of different ionization scenarii in glass ( fused silica ) and in crystal ( kdp ) on the filamentation dynamics of femtosecond and subpicosecond pulses .",
    "we reported fluence levels remaining below expected damage thresholds in solids .",
    "inside the filaments we observe significantly higher clamping intensities in kdp and higher peak electron densities in the conduction band .",
    "this finding may be important with respect to crystal defects or dopants with lower damage thresholds . despite the increased intensities during propagation , the filamentation dynamics are very similar in both materials if one takes into account the higher critical power in kdp .",
    "we provided evidence of the possibility to compress efficiently femtosecond pulses and develop wide supercontinua in both media .",
    "electronic states located in the band gap of kdp increase electron densities in the conduction band at low intensities and thus prolong the plasma channels in a postionization regime .",
