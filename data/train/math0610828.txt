    "when we started revising @xcite , it turned out that we needed similar localisation theorems in other situations . at this stage it was becoming desirable to understand these localisation theorems more abstractly , and indeed we got two non - overlapping , technical ( and very ugly ) statements .",
    "the first author then discussed these results with georges maltsiniotis , and they arrived at corollary [ c2 ] below . using proposition [ p1 ] below , one can easily see that the hypotheses of corollary [ c2 ] are verified in the case of theorem 3.8 of @xcite .",
    "however , they are not verified in some of the other geometric situations mentioned above .     catching \"",
    "the latter situations led to theorem [ t0 ] .",

    "* hypotheses ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) of corollary [ c2 ] ;    to crown all , maltsiniotis gave us an argument showing that @xmath20 : this is the content of theorem [ t1 ] a ) and the proof we give is essentially his .",
    "in the same period , jol riou proved a localisation theorem of a similar nature ( theorem [ riou ] ) .",
    "it turns out that hypotheses ( 0 ) , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are implied by riou s hypotheses ( and actually by less ) : see theorem [ p3 ] .    after stating and proving the main theorem , theorem [ t0 ]",
    ", we prove a  relativisation \" theorem , theorem [ t1 ] which leads to corollary [ c2 ] mentioned above .",
    "we then give a number of conditions which imply the hypotheses of theorem [ t0 ] in  [ 5 ] . in  [ 6 ] we show that the fact that @xmath10 is an equivalence of categories in is stable under adjoining products and coproducts .",
    "we then give some algebro - geometric applications ( hyperenvelopes , cubical hyperresolutions ... ) in  [ 7 ] , and finally , in ",
    "[ 8 ] , the birational applications we alluded to : those will be used to simplify the exposition of the revision @xcite of @xcite .    even though maltsiniotis did not wish to appear as a coauthor of this note , we want to stress his essential contributions in bringing the results here to their present form .",
    "let us also mention that hypotheses ( 0 ) , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) imply much more than theorem [ t0 ] : they actually yield the existence of an  absolute \" derived functor ( in the sense of quillen ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) ) associated to any functor @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is invertible .",

    "let us check the conditions :    * ( d1 ) , ( d2 ) and ( d3 ) and ( d4 ) are clear ( see proof of proposition [ p3.5 ] ) .",
    "* it remains to check ( d5 ) : if @xmath529 is a morphism in @xmath545 , then @xmath532 is contained in the smooth locus @xmath446 of @xmath267 , hence @xmath546 is in good position with respect to @xmath31 .",

    "the case of @xmath547 has been seen in proposition [ p3.6 ] and the case of @xmath548 in proposition [ p3.5 ] .",
    "the case of the other functors is then implied by the previous propositions ( the reader should draw a commutative cube of categories in order to check that enough equivalences of categories have been proven ) .",
    "\\a ) note that even though proposition [ p8.1 ] says that @xmath550 induces an equivalence of categories on localisations , where @xmath521 is the functor of proposition [ p3.5 ] , @xmath551 does not satisfy the ( dual ) simplicial hypotheses of theorem [ t0 ] .",
    "indeed , let @xmath267 be a non - quasiprojective variety over @xmath414 that we assume algebraically closed for simplicity .",
    "by kleiman s theorem @xcite , there exists a finite set @xmath552 of closed points of @xmath267 which is contained in no affine open subset , hence also in no quasi - projective open subset .",
    "thus , if @xmath553 and @xmath554 is the map defined by the @xmath555 , then @xmath87 is empty .",
    "this shows that the simplicial hypotheses are not preserved by finite product envelope .",
    "+ b ) also , while @xmath556 satisfies the dual simplicial hypotheses , it does not satisfy the dual of hypothesis ( 1 ) of corollary [ c2 ] : this is obvious from chow s lemma .",
    "this shows that the hypotheses of corollary [ c2 ] are strictly stronger than those of theorem [ t0 ] .          on the other hand ,",
    "the functor @xmath561 is neither full nor faithful , even under resolution of singularities .",
    "indeed , take @xmath414 of characteristic @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath267 be a proper irreducible curve of geometric genus @xmath562 with one nodal singular point @xmath563 .",
    "let @xmath564 be its normalisation , @xmath565 , @xmath566 , @xmath567 and @xmath568 , @xmath569 the two inclusions .",
    "we assume that @xmath570 consists of two rational points @xmath571 .",
    "finally , let @xmath572 be the map given by @xmath573 .",
    "@xmath574^{f_1}\\ar@<-2pt>[r]_{f_2 } & \\tilde x\\ar[r]^{\\bar \\pi}&x\\\\ & \\tilde u\\ar[u]^{\\tilde \\jmath}\\ar[r]^\\pi & u\\ar[u]_j } \\ ] ]    in @xmath575 , @xmath576 is an isomorphism so that @xmath577 .",
    "we claim that @xmath578 in @xmath579 .",
    "otherwise , since @xmath423-equivalence is a birational invariant of smooth proper varieties ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) , we would have @xmath580 .",
    "but this is false since @xmath581 has nonzero genus .",
    "we thank a. chambert - loir for his help in finding this example .",
    "more generally , it is well - known that for any integral curve @xmath522 and any two closed points @xmath582 there exists a proper birational morphism @xmath583 such that @xmath584 ( _ cf . _",
    "iv ,  1 , no 3 ) when @xmath25 is algebraically closed ) .",
    "this shows that any two morphisms @xmath585 such that @xmath586 and @xmath587 are closed points become equal in @xmath575 .",
    "this can be used to show that the functor @xmath588 _ does not have a right adjoint_.    non fullness holds even if we restrict to normal varieties .",
    "indeed , let us take @xmath589 and let @xmath267 be the affine cone with equation @xmath590 ( for @xmath591 this is a normal variety ) .",
    "let @xmath581 be a desingularisation of @xmath267 ( for example obtained by blowing up the singular point ) and @xmath513 a smooth compactification of @xmath581 .",
    "then @xmath592 by a valuation argument , hence @xmath593 by remark [ r3.2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath594 , hence @xmath595 we are indebted to mah for pointing out this example . for @xmath596 ,",
    "this singularity is even terminal in the sense of mori s minimal model programme , as beauville pointed out ( which seems to mean unfortunately that we can not insert this programme in our framework ... )    let @xmath186 .",
    "replacing all the subcategories @xmath19 of @xmath473 used above by their full subcategories @xmath597 consisting of schemes of dimension @xmath598 , one checks readily that all corresponding equivalences of categories remain valid , with the same proofs .",
    "this raises the question whether the induced functor @xmath599 is fully faithful for some ( or all ) choices of @xmath19 .",
    "it can be proven @xcite that this is true at least for @xmath600 in characteristic zero , hence for the other @xmath19s which become equivalent to it after inverting birational morphisms as in remark [ r3.2 ] .",
    "however , the proof is indirect and consists in observing that the morphisms are still given by the formula of remark [ r3.2 ] .",
    "it is an interesting question whether such a result can be proven by methods in the spirit of the present paper .",
