    "the years 1990 s started with the seminal paper presenting the ekert91 protocol  @xcite , relating quantum nonlocality to secure communication .",
    "this changed the world as far as quantum nonlocality is concerned ; the study of bell inequalities became respectable .",
    "so far not much was known beyond the famous chsh inequality  @xcite .",
    "here it is noteworthy to mention that bell s original inequality published in 1964  @xcite is not a bell inequality in the modern sense , because it relies on the additional assumption of perfect anti - correlation when both sides perform the same measurement .",
    "in particular , little was known when the parties perform measurements with more than two possible outcomes .",
    "kaszlikowski and co - workers performed numerical searches for experimental scenarios more resistant to noise  @xcite ; this effort led dan collins , then at geneva university , and colleagues to find the family of inequalities behind kaszlikowski et al .",
    "finding , today known as the cglmp inequalities  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , pitowski and svozil , building on their understanding that the set of local correlations constitues a polytope , could find all the inequalities corresponding to the facets of two scenarios of interest  @xcite .",
    "in a subsequent work , sliwa  @xcite and collins - gisin  @xcite grouped the results of pitowski and svozil into families of inequalities equivalent under relabelings .",
    "in particular sliwa found all the families corresponding to the scenario with 3 parties and binary inputs and outcomes , while collins - gisin found , among others , the family known as @xmath0 .",
    "avis , imai , ito and sakasi found many more bell inequalities using specialized cut - polytopes  @xcite .",
    "and so the field expanded very significantly , though it would still be nice to have more families of inequalities valid for arbitrary number of parties , measurement settings and outcomes  @xcite . also , experiments on bell s inequalities went out of the lab and entered applied physics  @xcite .    another trend that started was the use of bell - like inequalities to study the resources required to reproduce quantum correlations .",
    "such resources should involve all parties at hand , as highlighted by the inequality proposed by svetlichny back in 1987  @xcite , first violated in 2009  @xcite . considering a bipartite situation , bacon and toner derived in 2003 some inequalities satisfied by all correlations that can be reproduced with shared randomness ( as standard bell inequalities ) augmented by one single bit of communication  @xcite . the fact that their two inequalities could not be violated by two entangled qubits motivated them to find a model of maximally entangled pairs of qubits using a single bit of communication , the nowadays famous toner - bacon model  @xcite .",
    "a bit later brunner and gisin found inequalities valid for all correlations that can be simulated with one pr box  @xcite ; this shows that some correlations corresponding to very partially entangled pairs of qubits can definitively not be simulated with a single pr - box , though the problem remains open both for medium entangled qubits and for the case of a single bit of communication and arbitrary entanglement .",
    "recently , bell - like inequalities were also used in several contexts worth mentioning .",
    "the first context is the one of entanglement witnesses ( ew ) .",
    "it is well - known that any violation of a bell inequality witnesses entanglement ( at least according to today s physics ) .",
    "conversely , in the bipartite case , all ew written in a form independent of explicit observables  that is written in a device - independent manner  are also bell inequalities .",
    "hence , for two parties bell inequalities are equivalent to device - independent entanglement witnesses ( diews ) .",
    "but for more parties this is no longer true : all bell inequalities are not diews  @xcite , see also the recent experimental demonstration  @xcite .",
    "second , in the context of randomness analysis , bell inequalities can certify intrinsic randomness  @xcite .",
    "third , the tool of bell - like inequalities can be used to study hypothetical models of quantum correlations based on `` hidden influences '' propagating at finite - but - supraluminal speeds  @xcite . finally , in the context of self - testing ,",
    "violation of a bell inequality can provide certification for the proper behavior of a device without relying on previous calibration  @xcite .",
    "these recent developments show the relevance of finding a common language for our community to discuss its findings , as presented in this paper .",
    "while it is quite straightforward to write down a bell inequality , a number of parameters make this writing not unique .",
    "thus , two inequalities with similar properties can look superficially very different .",
    "this degeneracy can hide obvious facts , and thus constitutes a practical obstacle in the study of bell inequalities . as an example , the inequality a1 , given in 2012 by grandjean et al  @xcite , is equivalent to an inequality published 8 years before as eq . 4 in  @xcite , yet",
    "this fact was not noticed at the time of publication .",
    "we present here a scheme to deal with these redundancies , which allows each family of inequalities to be referenced by its index in a list of canonical inequalities .",
    "an open - source library implements our scheme .",
    "it can be freely used by researchers to automate the computations .",
    "thanks to this tool , we launched a growing interactive library of bell inequalities , available at the url _",
    "our paper is structured as follows : we first clarify in section  [ sec : bell - stuff ] the concept of bell inequalities and bell expressions , before describing in section  [ sec : redundancies ] several degeneracies that can appear in the description of a bell inequality . in section  [ sec : cure ] , we show how to remove with each of these degeneracies individually .",
    "this leads us to propose in section  [ sec : decomposing ] a method to decompose bell inequalities into a canonical form . in section  [ sec : compendium ] , we describe the tools we are making available to decompose and classify bell inequalities .",
    "in a bell experiment , @xmath1 parties each hold a system that they measure successively with one of several measurement settings , each time recording one out of several possible measurement outcomes . in general",
    ", the number of available measurements might differ from one party to another one , just like the number of outcomes that these measurements can produce .",
    "these numbers of measurement settings and outcomes , together with the number of parties taking part in the experiment , define a _ bell scenario_. for simplicity , we consider in the main text that all parties have the same number of possible settings and outcomes , respectively @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we call these scenarios _ homogeneous _ , and refer to them with the triple @xmath4 . except for one additional step that needs to be taken into consideration ( c.f",
    ". appendix  [ app : nonhomogeneous ] ) , all the results contained in the main text extend straightforwardly to non - homogeneous scenarios .     and @xmath5 ) .",
    "upon measurement , the systems provide outcomes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the estimation of the conditional probability @xmath8 characterizing the response of the devices requires no knowledge of their inner workings  @xcite.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    in a situation in which only information about the measurement settings and outcomes used by the parties is available , the conditional probability @xmath8 with which outcomes @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the different parties ( here two parties ) are observed when they use measurement settings @xmath9 and @xmath5 respectively ( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ) , is of particular interest .",
    "these probabilities ( or _ correlations _ ) can indeed be estimated in principle simply by repeating the experiment a sufficient number of times , and without further assumption on the measured systems or measurement procedure ( i.e. in the so - called device - independent manner  @xcite ) .",
    "these correlations form a list of @xmath10 real numbers that can be conveniently represented as a vector or point in the vector space @xmath11 .",
    "properties of these points can be highlighted with the aid of _ bell expressions _ , i.e. linear forms @xmath12 any such expression can be defined by its coefficients @xmath13 , which also form a vector in the dual vector space @xmath14 .",
    "a bell expression taking a definite value @xmath15 defines a hyperplane in the space of correlations which divides the space into two distinct regions .",
    "such hyperplane can thus always be used to demonstrate that a point @xmath16 does not belong to some convex set @xmath17 , whenever it is the case  @xcite .",
    "this is conventionally done by writing a _ bell - like inequality _",
    "@xmath18 with bound @xmath19 , and showing that the inequality is violated for the considered point of probabilities , i.e. @xmath20 .    a set of particular interest in the space of conditional probabilities is the local set , given by all correlations which can be decomposed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is positive and normalized  @xcite .",
    "inequalities satisfied by this set are referred to as _",
    "bell inequalities_. since this set is a polytope  @xcite , it can be described with a minimal number of such inequalities : the facets of this polytope .",
    "these bell inequalities are thus of special interest .",
    "note that with respect to a given convex set , every bell expression @xmath23 can give rise to two bell - like inequalities : one bounding the expression from below , and one from above .",
    "in general , these the two inequalities can have different natures .",
    "for instance , one might be a facet of the local polytope , while the other one is not ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : froissart ] ) .",
    "we thus wish to distinguish between these two inequalities .     scenario .",
    "the horizontal axis is the value of the @xmath24 bell expression  @xcite .",
    "this bell expression has different properties with respect to the sets displayed here depending on the orientation considered . on the right side of the figure ,",
    "the @xmath24 expression gives rise , through an upper bound , to a facet of the local polytope ( dotted line ) , which admits a quantum violation . in the opposite direction , however , the same expression ( dotted line ) gives not rise to a facet , and shows no quantum advantage . ]    at the same time , several other sets of correlations than the local one , and their associated bell - like inequalities , have proven useful in various contexts ( e.g. to demonstrate genuine multipartite nonlocality or entanglement , non - simulability , etc  @xcite ) .",
    "a given bell expression can then have various upper and lower bounds of interest .",
    "when comparing two inequalities given by coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath25 and , say , upper - bounds @xmath19 , @xmath26 , it is thus important to recognize not only if they describe the same bell - like inequality , but also if they represent the same expression with different bounds .",
    "we thus wish to identify identical expressions with different bounds , but distinguish between expressions bounded from above or from below . for this purpose",
    ", we define an _ oriented bell expression _ to be the combination of a bell expression @xmath23 with an inequality sign . by convention",
    ", we choose to consider only oriented bell expressions bounded from above , i.e. with inequality sign `` @xmath27 '' .",
    "all upper bounds on @xmath23 can then be seen as properties of this object , while lower bounds , which are upper bounds on the bell expression @xmath28 , are dissociated from it .",
    "geometrically speaking , an oriented bell expression can be understood as describing a direction of interest in the space of correlations .",
    "opposite directions can have different properties ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : froissart ] ) .",
    "note that , since it describes a direction in probability space , an oriented bell expression needs not come with a bound per se . at the same time , an oriented bell expression with bounds can be understood simply as a collection of bell - like inequalities . with respect to one",
    "chosen set of correlations , a bell expression has a unique tight upper bound , so it only gives rise to one tight bell - like inequality .",
    "the sets of correlations one can wish to consider in a bell experiment typically satisfy several constraints .",
    "each constraint introduces freedom in the way that a bell inequality can be written while yet performing the same test .",
    "here we describe such constraints and the degeneracies they induce on the description of bell - like inequalities . in the next section",
    "we propose a solution to lift these degeneracies .",
    "all the constraints considered here are satisfied by the local , quantum and no - signaling sets of correlations .",
    "maybe one of the most trivial constraints expected to be satisfied by all physical probabilities is that they are normalized .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath29 in the bipartite case ( which we use by default in the rest of this paper for the sake of the example ) . whenever the probabilities one wants to consider satisfy this constraint",
    ", we can rewrite any bell expression in infinitely many different ways . as an example , consider the positivity constraint @xmath30 , with coefficients @xmath31 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 define the same inequality through @xmath33 , for any @xmath34 . therefore we see a first degree of freedom in the way one can write the simple positivity constraint .    apart from considering normalized probabilities",
    ", we may also wish to restrict our attention to correlations satisfying the no - signaling condition .",
    "all correlations predicted by quantum theory indeed satisfy this constraint , and together with the normalization conditions , these constraints define the smallest affine probability subspace @xmath35 , of dimension @xmath36 , which contains the set of quantum correlations .",
    "these conditions take the form @xmath37 and similarly for the sum over the first party s outcomes .",
    "just like with normalization , the no - signaling condition again defines infinitely many variations in the way one can write a given bell expression .",
    "let us point out an example of two famous inequalities which are equivalent over all normalized no - signaling probabilities : the chsh inequality  @xcite was first described as @xmath38 is a correlation function .",
    "choosing sign @xmath39 for the absolute value , this inequality can be described by the coefficients @xmath40 and bound @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ch inequality  @xcite reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the parties marginal probabilities .",
    "writing @xmath45 and @xmath46 , this expression can be described by the coefficients @xmath47 and bound @xmath48 .",
    "these coefficients and bounds are clearly different from the chsh ones and so do not appear to be related to those of ch at first sight .",
    "however , adding the following expression to it : @xmath49/8 = { \\alpha}^\\text{chsh}_{abxy}/4 - { \\alpha}^\\text{ch}_{abxy } - \\frac{1}{8},\\ ] ] which vanishes for probabilities satisfying  , reveals the affine transformation that relates both expressions .",
    "the two inequalities thus define a test along the same hyperplane for all normalized no - signalling correlations .    here",
    "we choose to consider as equivalent inequalities which act identically on the space of normalized no - signaling correlations .",
    "we thus wish to eliminate this kind of redundancies .",
    "note that this might not be desired in some specific situations in which , for instance , communication between the parties is allowed .      in a bell experiment , it is often the case that no preferential importance is attached to any particular party , measurement setting or outcome .",
    "indeed , the value of a particular party , measurement setting or outcome is often used simply as a label , attributed for the sake of distinguishability , but with a level of arbitrariness .",
    "therefore , any permutation of parties , settings or outcomes which is compatible with the bell scenario transforms probabilities @xmath8 into @xmath50 which can be obtained from the same data , by relabeling the parties , settings or outcomes . in turn",
    ", the same permutation can be applied to any bell expression whenever the considered set of correlations is also invariant under such permutations .    as an example , consider the inequality @xmath51 .",
    "it describes a different half - space than @xmath52 in @xmath53 . yet ,",
    "any experiment whose correlations violate one of these inequalities can also violate the other one if the labels of bob s outcomes @xmath54 and @xmath55 are attributed in an opposite manner ( say @xmath54 to horizontal photon polarization and @xmath55 to vertical polarization instead of the opposite , e.g. ) .",
    "since most sets one is concerned with are invariant under relabeling of parties , settings and outcomes , we wish to analyse these inequalities independently of such relabelings .",
    "all sets of correlations need not satisfy this constraint , though ( see  @xcite for an example ) .",
    "having considered conditions that apply to sets of correlations in a fixed bell scenario , we now consider conditions that one can expect to hold in the relation between different scenarios . in this context , we refer to a rule that generates sets of correlations for various scenarios as a _",
    "model_. for instance , the local model , defined by eq .  , generates distinct sets of correlations in each bell scenario .",
    "all the constraints considered here are again satisfied by the local , quantum and no - signaling sets of correlations .",
    "first , consider an inequality which does nt involve certain parties , even though they are available in the considered scenario .",
    "this would be the case if one were to test the chsh inequality in a tripartite experiment for instance .",
    "clearly , the coefficients of this inequality are not identical to the ones of the chsh inequality for two parties ( they even belong to different spaces ) . yet , the test performed is arguably physically identical .",
    "one is thus tempted to neglect the third irrelevant party from the scope , and rewrite the inequality in a bipartite scenario only .",
    "this simple operation brings us back to analyze an inequality in a simpler scenario .",
    "while this operation sounds trivial , it is justified to carry the bound of the inequality through it only when the respective sets of correlations defined by the tested model in both scenarios satisfy some constraints .",
    "namely , they must be such that the set @xmath56 of @xmath1-partite correlations produced by the model in an @xmath57-partite situation , where @xmath58 , coincides with the set @xmath59 of @xmath1-partite correlations it produces in presence of @xmath1 parties , i.e. @xmath60 this is of course the case for most sets of interest .",
    "we thus wish to neglect parties of a bell scenario which do not intervene in a bell test .",
    "when the value of a bell expression does not depend on which result a party chooses to output for some setting @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 , then it should be clear that an experiment evaluating it could in principle be achievable without using this measurement setting @xmath61 at all .",
    "thus , we also consider removing such setting to simplify the scenario . again , this is valid whenever the tested model satisfies the condition @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the set of correlations produced by the considered model with @xmath2 possible settings , and @xmath65 the set achieved when @xmath66 settings are used , but the statistics of the @xmath67 additional settings are neglected .      when no setting is superfluous , but yet two outcomes play the same role in a bell - like inequality , i.e. @xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath61 , such that @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , one might as well not distinguish between them and just assign a single outcome for both cases .",
    "indeed , arbitrarily many different inequalities can be generated by increasing the number of outcomes which together share the same probability weight , while the test performed by the corresponding inequality remains the same because it does not distinguish between them .",
    "we thus wish to avoid such degeneracy as well .",
    "this is possible whenever the considered set satisfies @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the set of correlations produced by the considered model with @xmath3 possible outcomes , and @xmath74 the set achieved when the model can produce @xmath75 outcomes , but some are grouped together to form only @xmath3 of them .",
    "as we just argued , the bound of an inequality is unaltered in presence of superfluous parties , inputs or output distinction , provided the tested model satisfies the corresponding constraint . in some cases , however ,",
    "more can be said about the relationship between inequalities created by adding artificial parties , settings or outcomes distinction .",
    "one such observation was presented in  @xcite , where it was shown that the property of an inequality being ( or not ) a facet of the local polytope is preserved when adding irrelevant settings or distinction between outcomes , an operation also known as _ lifting _ an inequality .",
    "this property is however not kept when extending the experiment to another party in the way we just described ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : liftings ] ) .",
    "rather , lifting an inequality to more parties in such a way that its facet property is preserved ( with respect to the local polytope ) can be accomplished by conditioning the test that this inequality performs to some outcome observed by the additional parties  @xcite .",
    "this operation is a special case of the one we introduce now .          here",
    ", we describe a way of adding parties in a bell scenario which preserves the facet property for the local polytope .",
    "the inequality obtained is tight for all models satisfying the constraint given below .",
    "this immediately implies that the local , quantum and no - signaling bounds are inherited from this construction .",
    "as mentioned , adding a passive party to a bell test does nt result in an optimal test in the new extended scenario ( see figure  [ fig : liftings ] ) , but conditioning the test to an outcome of the additional party does , and is known as a lifting  @xcite .",
    "let us thus consider models which satisfy the constraint that the correlations they produce in an @xmath1-partite scenario coincide with the @xmath1-partite correlations produced in an @xmath57-partite scenario , with @xmath58 , whenever these correlations are conditioned to the @xmath76 remaining parties outcomes .",
    "we denote this condition as : @xmath77 in other words , this condition states that any @xmath1-partite correlations can be prepared in an @xmath57-partite scenario upon heralding from the results of measurements performed by the @xmath76 remaining parties ; and that any such preparation produces valid @xmath1-partite correlations .    we show in appendix  [ compositeappendix ] that if two expressions with coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath78 are bounded above by @xmath79 and @xmath80 and below by @xmath81 and @xmath82 for such models ( satisfying ) , then the tensor product of the two inequalities satisfies : @xmath83 as an illustration , consider bounding the tensor product of two chsh expressions with respect to the local set .",
    "the corresponding expression reads @xmath84 where we use the fact that correlations are no - signaling .",
    "since the set of local correlations satisfies  , one has that @xmath85 , which is bounded between @xmath86 and @xmath87 . the local bound of   is thus @xmath88 in agreement with  .    in appendix  [ compositeappendix ]",
    "we also show that any two bell - like inequalities defining facets with respect to a model can be compose to produce a new facet for this model .",
    "thus arbitrarily many bell inequalities can be generated again in this way by composing bell inequalities involving fewer parties .",
    "since this construction carries through significant properties for the local , quantum and no - signaling sets , and provides insight into inequalities that can be seen as products of simpler expressions , we choose also not to consider composite inequalities as canonical .",
    "this includes not considering liftings of an inequality to more parties as fundamental , since these can be seen to be compositions with the positivity constraints ( construction   generalizes to compositions involving different number of parties . ) .",
    "note that expressions with superfluous parties are also composite , as compositions with a constant .",
    "they are thus also detected as non - canonical here .",
    "examples of properties which are not inherited from rule   include for instance svetlichny and biseparable bounds  @xcite , because their corresponding sets do nt satisfy  .",
    "we now describe a cure for each degeneracies mentioned in the last section . taken together , this allows us to identify bell - like inequalities and expressions independently of any such degeneracy . in the next section  [ sec : decomposing ]",
    "we will use this to define families of bell - like inequalities and write down a decomposition for any oriented bell expression in terms of canonical representatives .      an original way to deal with the degeneracies induced by the normalization and",
    "no - signaling conditions was provided in  @xcite : it consists in parametrizing the space of probabilities with joint and marginal probabilities , but without monitoring the last outcome .",
    "every coefficient involving the last outcome of some parties can then be computed from the normalization and no - signaling condition , and any bell expression is described by a unique set of coefficients .",
    "we refer to this as the collins - gisin parametrizations .",
    "while it solves part of the problem , this solution does not treat all outcomes similarly . as a result ,",
    "computing the effect of relabelings that involve the last outcomes require the use of arithmetic , and this would complicate significantly the search for a particular representative under relabelings .    to avoid this complication ,",
    "we choose instead to keep all the coefficients in , such that relabeling parties , settings or outcomes only amounts to permuting the coefficients of @xmath89 .",
    "the normalization and no - signaling redundancies can then be eliminated in a way which is compatible with these permutations by choosing a parametrization of bell expressions acting on normalized no - signaling subspace @xmath53 in @xmath90 which treats all parties , settings and outcomes on an equal footing .",
    "to construct such a parametrization , we start by identifying components of the dual space @xmath91 that are symmetric under relabellings and capture the normalization and no - signaling conditions .",
    "we eventually wish to extend our construction to an arbitrary number of parties , so we choose to consider bases that are tensor across the parties .",
    "we thus only need to define a basis for single parties . in these terms , the normalization can be written as : @xmath92 here the value of the components @xmath93 is fixed by the constraint that it must be symmetric under permutation of the inputs .",
    "we thus have isolated the component of @xmath91 which will encode the normalization .",
    "adding @xmath94 times @xmath95 to a bell expression shifts its value by the constant @xmath94 on all normalized correlations .",
    "we now proceed with the no - signaling equations , which can be rewritten as : @xmath96 and similarly for no - signaling from bob to alice .",
    "this time , the individual components @xmath97 are not invariant under permutation of settings .",
    "however , one can verify that the subspace @xmath98 they generate is invariant : any permuted @xmath99 can be re - expressed as a linear combination of @xmath100 only .",
    "together , @xmath101 and @xmath93 define a basis for an @xmath2-dimensional subspace of @xmath91 which is invariant under permutations of settings and outcomes for alice . to form a complete basis , @xmath102 additional elements",
    "@xmath103 are needed , and the subspace spanned by these elements should also be invariant under relabelings .",
    "a simple form for these elements is : @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this choice generalizes the correlators already used in the literature in the case of scenarios with binary outcomes .    a bipartite bell expression",
    "can then be expressed in terms of a complete basis @xmath107 as @xmath108 where @xmath109 are the components of the expression in the new symmetric basis .",
    "expressed in the basis that isolates no - signalling terms , and is compatible with the bell permutations .",
    "we write @xmath110 the coefficient @xmath111 corresponding to the basis elements @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "terms describing marginals and no - signaling conditions are isolated .",
    "the latter are shaded in gray .",
    "the projection shifts the normalization coefficient to the bound , and removes coefficients corresponding to no - signaling constraints . ]    since adding any terms of the form @xmath114 or @xmath115 to the expression does not change its value for no - signaling correlations , we can always choose to add such terms so that their coefficients disappear in the expression ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : coefficientsmatrix ] ) .",
    "similarly , adding @xmath95 shifts the whole expression by a constant .",
    "we thus define an expression independently of such shifts by setting this element to zero .",
    "re - expressing the projected coefficients in terms of probabilities , this defines new coefficients @xmath116 which are not subject to normalization or no - signaling redundancies , and behave well under permutations or parties , settings and outcomes : @xmath117 the inequality @xmath118 can then be rewritten as : @xmath119    a last degeneracy is given by multiplying both sides of by some factor . for inequalities with rational coefficients , this can be dealt with by multiplying the coefficients @xmath116 by a positive number so that the resulting coefficients are integers with greatest common divisor 1 .",
    "this allows one to identify any oriented bell expression uniquely within the normalized no - signaling subspace .",
    "moreover , by construction this identification is compatible with bell permutations : a permutation of parties , settings or outcomes applied on the coefficients @xmath116 never re - introduces terms of the form @xmath114 , @xmath115 or @xmath95 .",
    "the construction above generalizes readily to multipartite scenarios , by repeating the basis construction for the additional parties . in the appendix  [ app : nonhomogeneous ]",
    ", we give an example of this construction for a non - homogeneous scenario .      to illustrate our construction , and the uniqueness of the bell expression it produces , let us take the coefficients @xmath120 for the ch expression  , and decompose them on the basis @xmath121 : @xmath122 and using the same construction for bob s basis .",
    "let us take the bell expression for the ch inequality in  , and let us decompose : @xmath123 such that : @xmath124    when considering the chsh inequality  , we observe that the correlators @xmath125 , and thus : @xmath126 which is already in the no - signaling subspace and of the form @xmath127 .",
    "the two expressions are thus recognized as equivalent , with coefficients @xmath128 .",
    "given coefficients @xmath13 for an arbitrary oriented bell expression ( for instance as obtained after the projection and renormalization presented above ) , equivalent representatives can be obtained by relabeling parties , settings or outcomes . for a finite number of parties , settings and outcomes ,",
    "the number of possible relabelings is finite as well .",
    "we notice that relabelings permute the coefficients of this vector , defining an orbit in the space @xmath91 , the size of this orbit being finite .",
    "we choose to select a canonical representative from this orbit by using lexicographic ordering .    to do so",
    ", we first define an enumeration of the coefficients @xmath13 using a bijection @xmath129 , with @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath132 and @xmath133 be two relabelings of the bell expression @xmath134 ; we order them lexicographically by defining :    @xmath135    the _ minimal _ representative is then the first one under the lexicographic ordering @xmath136 . as the definition depends on the enumeration of coefficients , we prescribe the following : for a quadruplet @xmath137 , the next element is found by incrementing first alice s outcome @xmath6 , then by incrementing alice s setting @xmath9 , then by incrementing bob s outcome @xmath7 , finally by incrementing bob s setting @xmath5 ( as seen in figure  [ fig : coefficientsorder ] ) .",
    "this defines the bijection @xmath138 uniquely .",
    "as seen in appendix  [ app : group : faster ] , grouping the outcomes and settings of each party individually in the enumeration enables the construction of fast algorithms to select the minimal lexicographic representative .",
    "we choose to increment alice indices first to be compatible with the column - major order used to store multi - dimensional arrays in e.g. matlab .",
    "having defined this order , a particular member of the orbit can be identified either by the permutation that has to be applied to the minimal representative to retrieve the member , or by specifying the rank of this member in the lexicographic order .",
    "computing the first lexicographic representative of the orbit an inequality belongs to , or computing its rank in the sorted list can be performed , in principle , by enumerating this list completely . however , this approach is not practical for scenarios involving more than a handful number of parties , settings or outcomes . in appendix  [ app : group ] , we show how a first representative can be computed quickly by using computational group theory .",
    "we also give a fast algorithm to find the index of a representative in the list and obtain the @xmath139 representative .",
    "this allows for the identification of every oriented bell expression by writing the minimal representative of its orbit , and its rank in the lexicographic order of its orbit .    for the most complex inequalities in  @xcite ,",
    "our algorithm can find the first representative by lexicographic order in a list of about @xmath140 relabelings in a few seconds on a standard computer .      as mentioned in  [ sec : redundancies : superfluous ] , duplicating an outcome , or introducing irrelevant settings or parties produces valid inequalities in scenarios that are larger than strictly needed to express the constraint at hand . in the case of superfluous settings or outcomes distinctions , we call such inequalities _ i / o - lifted_. to avoid multiple definitions of equivalent bell - like inequalities , we write every bell expression in the smallest scenario",
    "in which it is relevant , i.e. such that it is _ non - i / o - lifted_.    note that the coefficients corresponding to irrelevant settings or outcomes playing the same role might not vanish in an expression involving full probabilities .",
    "for instance , the positivity @xmath141 expressed with one irrelevant input and a duplicate outcome then reads : @xmath142 where all inputs and outcomes intervene .",
    "however , they are easily spotted by checking conditions given in section  [ sec : redundancies : superfluous ] , or by examination of invariance of the inequality under permutation of settings or outcomes .",
    "the inequality can then be rewritten in a simplified scenario .",
    "following observation  , we say that a bell expression @xmath13 is _ composite _ if it can be written in a tensor form , i.e. if @xmath68 @xmath94 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 such that @xmath145 otherwise , we call the expression _ non - composite_. here @xmath93 and @xmath146 identify constant terms ( c.f .",

    "this decomposition generalizes straightforwardly to cases involving more than one party on each side , and can result in decompositions of the form @xmath147 with constants @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "when @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are non - composite , we refer to them as being the _ components _ of @xmath153 .",
    "we show in appendix  [ compositeappendix ] that when the bell expressions @xmath154 only have rational coefficients , such decomposition is unique up to the sign of the individual expressions .",
    "this guarantees that this decomposition can be found by using recursively the following method :    1 .",
    "given a bell expression @xmath89 , examine for each separation of the parties into two groups of parties whether a constant @xmath94 can be added to the expression in order to allow the expression to be written as a tensor product across this separation .",
    "2 .   when such a biseparation is found , repeat step 1 for each new bell expression found .",
    "if such biseparation does not exist , the expression is non - composite .    note that whether a bell expression is composite or not does not depend on the considered bound , or on the side on which one wishes to bound it .",
    "it is thus a property of the expression .",
    "still , in some instances , bounds on an expression can be transmitted through the composition or decomposition operation .",
    "we described in section  [ sec : redundancies : composite ] the condition under which this is possible for composition ( proof in appendix  [ compositeappendix ] ) .",
    "appendix  [ compositeappendix ] also describes cases in which a bound @xmath19 on an expression like   can be transmitted to one of its components .",
    "in the previous section we showed that any of the following degeneracies in bell - like inequalities can be dealt with :    * the orientation ( @xmath155 ) is fixed by choosing oriented bell expressions bounded from above , * the degeneracy given by the no - signaling constraints is dealt with using the parametrization of section  [ sec : cure : no - signaling : basis ] , * in non - homogenous scenarios , parties and measurements settings are ordered as described in appendix  [ app : nonhomo : canonicalscenarios ] , * the arbitrary constant present in the bell expression because of the normalization of probability distributions is extracted , and the expression is multiplied by a non - negative factor such that it can be written down using relatively prime integers , as described in eq .  , * the degeneracy due to relabellings is lifted by looking for the minimal lexicographic representative of the inequality , as described in section  [ sec : cure : relabelings ] .    used in this order ,",
    "each degeneracy removal operation needs only to be applied once .",
    "the two operations below can require some of the above operations to be repeated , but only need to be applied a finite number of times :    * superfluous outcomes or measurements settings are removed by transposing the inequality into a simpler scenario , as described in section  [ sec : cure : superfluous ] , * composite expressions are decomposed as described in section  [ sec : cure : composite ] .",
    "we say that a non - composite oriented bell expression is in _ canonical form _",
    "when no redundancies are left .",
    "furthermore , we say that two non - composite oriented bell expressions are _ equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other one by using the transformations above .",
    "any non - composite oriented bell expression with rational coefficients can thus be described by its canonical form and a transformation associated to each level of degeneracy .",
    "this description also applies to every oriented component of a composite bell expression .",
    "any composite bell - like inequality can thus be _ decomposed _ as a combination of the form   of non - composite oriented bell expressions , which have , each , one canonical form .",
    "thus , any oriented bell expression involved in a given bell - like inequality can be identified in this way . as discussed in section  [ sec : cure : composite ] , this combination is in general not unique because of the freedom left in the choice of sign for its components .",
    "however , the two orientations of a bell expression can sometimes be equivalent to each other thanks to some of the degeneracied described above . when this is the case for all components of a composite bell - like inequality , its decomposition is unique .",

    "for pedagogical reasons , the main text focuses on the elimination of redundancies for _ homogeneous _ scenarios , where the number of measurement settings @xmath2 and outcomes @xmath3 is the same everywhere .",

    "thus , non - homogenous scenarios have intrinsic restrictions on the relabelings that can be performed .    still ,",
    "the non - homogeneous scenarios @xmath161 $ ] and @xmath165 $ ] describe essentially the same physical system , and inequalities can be transfered from one scenario to the other one by applying a _ reordering _ of the parties and measurement settings ( not to be confused with relabellings which do not affect the bell scenario ) .",
    "thus , before looking for the minimal lexicographic representative of an expression , we have to reorder the expression so that its scenario is in a _",

    "this definition naturally extends to bell expressions involving more parties , by letting @xmath330 and @xmath331 describe expressions for two disjoint subset of parties . in this appendix",
    "@xmath252 should thus be understood as the settings and outcomes of a group of parties , and similarly for @xmath332 .",
    "we then refer to a and b as two ( non - overlaping ) groups of parties .    as discussed in the main text , the coefficients @xmath13 of an arbitrary bell expression",
    "are not uniquely defined due to the normalization and no - signaling conditions .",
    "this opens the possibility for an expression which does nt satisfy eq .   to be equivalent over the set of no - signaling correlations to another one , @xmath25 , which might admit such decomposition",
    "let us show that this degeneracy can be dealt with through the choice of parametrization provided in section  [ sec : cure : no - signaling ] because any bell expression which can be written as composite for no - signaling correlations must appear so in this parametrization .",
    "[ propositionsig ] if a bell expression @xmath13 can be decomposed into two expressions @xmath143 , @xmath144 , then its parametrization @xmath116 ( described in eq .",
    "[ eq : cbar ] ) can also be decomposed into two expressions @xmath333 , @xmath334 .",
    "tensor product structures are independent of particular choices of bases .",
    "let us thus use the basis @xmath335 of section  [ sec : cure : no - signaling ] for each group of parties .",
    "this basis contains three types of elements : @xmath336 , @xmath337 and @xmath338 ( for groups involving more than one party , any basis element containing a @xmath338 vector for one of its party is of type @xmath338 ) . in this basis",
    ", identity   thus takes the form ( written here in a table form similar to figure  [ fig : coefficientsmatrix ] ) @xmath339 where the different @xmath111s might denote vectors or matrices when their arguments include either @xmath337 or @xmath338 .",
    "clearly , setting the last lines and columns to 0 on the lhs and rhs of   preserves equality .",
    "this also defines expressions @xmath116 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 through eq .  , thus concluding the proof .",
    "the previous proposition ensures that when checking for the decomposability of a bell expression , one does not need to consider the adjunction of terms containing elements of the type @xmath338 to the expression .",
    "the addition of a constant , however can be necessary to decompose a bell expression .",
    "for instance , @xmath340 is only a tensor product after addition of the constant 1 .",
    "thus exactly one parameter needs to be chosen in order to verify whether an expression can be decomposed as a tensor product : a shift by a constant .",
    "let us show that an expression admits a decomposition only for one value of this constant .",
    "[ propositionsingleconstant ] consider a non - i / o - lifted multipartite bell expression .",
    "if the addition of a constant @xmath94 allows one to factor a group of parties from this expression , and the addition of a constant @xmath341 allows one to factor another group of parties , then one must have @xmath342 .",
    "the statement is trivial in the bipartite case since factoring one party then automatically factors the other one , and a party can be factored only for one value of the constant .",
    "let us thus consider a bell expression @xmath343 with three groups of parties .",
    "following the parametrization of section  [ sec : cure : no - signaling ] , this bell expression can be written as a tensor of @xmath111 components which we denote by @xmath344 : here each index corresponds to one group of parties .",
    "thanks to proposition  [ propositionsig ] , we know that we can choose all free components of @xmath344 equal to zero , except possibly the normalization @xmath345 .",
    "that one group of parties , say a , can be factored in @xmath344 after addition of the constant @xmath94 means that there exist some tensors @xmath346 and @xmath347 such that @xmath348 simliarly , one has @xmath349 and @xmath350 such that @xmath351 if c can be factored out after addition of the constant @xmath341 .    the fact that @xmath352 is not a lifting under input and outputs implies that there exist an index , denote it @xmath353 such that @xmath354 .",
    "let us write @xmath355 since @xmath354 , we find that @xmath356 . moreover , if @xmath357 then @xmath358 and we directly obtain @xmath342 . similarly if @xmath359 .",
    "so we are only interested in the case @xmath360 , which has @xmath361 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath362 and thus @xmath363 compared to the first equation of  , this shows that @xmath342 .",
    "one consequence of this proposition is that when writing an expression in a table form across a bipartition ( like in the lhs of eq .  ) , it is only possible for an expression to be a product across this bipartition if the rank of this matrix is smaller or equal to 2 .",
    "proposition  [ propositionsingleconstant ] also guarantees that the order of groups of parties according to which one tests for a tensor structure does not matter : all give the same result .",
    "thus , after the identification of its tensor structure , a composite bell expression must be of the following form : @xmath364 where we made the tensor product explicit and indices on the bell expressions indicate the parties they involve .",
    "note that in this decomposition , expressions are only defined up to a constant , which is arbitrary : changing @xmath365 for @xmath366 and @xmath367 for @xmath368 keeps eq .",
    "the magnitude of these constants can however be fixed when dealing with rational bell expressions by requiring that the coefficients of all expressions be integers with greatest common divisors equal to 1 .",
    "the only remaining freedom then lies in the choice of sign : @xmath369 is equaliy valid as @xmath370 .",
    "bell expressions can be bounded with respect to convex sets of correlations .",
    "let us show that when these sets satisfy condition   of the main text , the bound of a composite expression is inherited from the bounds of its sub - expressions .",
    "[ propositionbound ] if the following bounds hold for bell expressions @xmath143 and @xmath144 with respect to a no - signaling model satisfying eq .  : @xmath371 then expression @xmath372 satisfies @xmath373 moreover , these bounds are tight if the bounds on @xmath143 and @xmath144 are .",
    "let us consider the value of the expression defined by @xmath13 : @xmath374 where we used the no - signaling condition .",
    "now because of condition   and  , we must have that @xmath375 for all @xmath376 .",
    "moreover , these bounds must be tight if the ones for unconditioned correlations are .",
    "this gives the lower and upper bound of by considering any possible combination of bounds on this expression together with bounds on @xmath143 .",
    "these combined bounds are achievable by construction .    from proposition  [ propositionbound ] and",
    "the fact that condition   is satisfied for the sets of local , quantum and no - signaling correlations , we deduce that the local , quantum and no - signaling bounds of composite inequalities are inherited from the corresponding bounds on each of their component expression .    on the other hand , given a bound @xmath19 on @xmath89 for models satisfying  , eq .   also puts constraints on the possible bounds that @xmath330 and @xmath331 can have . for instance , if the bounds on one of the sub - expressions are known ( because it is a single - party expression for instance ) then bounds can be deduced for the second expression .",
    "a particular example of this is when @xmath82 and @xmath80 are known and strictly positive . in this case , it is clear that @xmath377 , which allows one to deduce the value of @xmath378 .        to demonstrate the facet property of the composite inequality",
    ", we construct a set of @xmath382 linearly independent probability vectors which saturate the inequality . here",
    "@xmath383 denotes the dimension of the normalized no - signaling subspace @xmath384 for the first group of @xmath385 parties , i.e. @xmath386 for a homogeneous scenario , and @xmath387 denotes the dimension of @xmath388 for the second group of parties .",
    "the dimension of the normalized no - signaling space @xmath53 is @xmath389 .",
    "the fact that @xmath379 is a facet in @xmath384 implies that there exist @xmath383 linearly independent probability vectors @xmath390 which belong to the first set of correlations and saturate this inequality . since @xmath384 satisfies the normalization condition , it lives in an affine subspace of the full proobability space .",
    "the set @xmath391 can thus be completed by one vector from the set of correlations allowed by the model for the first @xmath385 parties to form a basis @xmath392 of a space containing @xmath384 .",
    "similarly , we can define sets @xmath393 and @xmath394 of respectively @xmath387 and @xmath395 linearly independent probability vectors .",
    "all these vectors belong to the set of correlations for the second group of @xmath396 parties , and every @xmath397 saturates the second inequality , i.e. satisfies @xmath398 .    since the considered model satisfies condition  , conditional probabilities for the second group of parties @xmath399 in @xmath53 can take any value that @xmath400 is allowed to take within the set @xmath388 .",
    "therefore , the tensor product of any two points @xmath401 defines a valid point for the set of correlations in @xmath53 , for all @xmath167 and @xmath234 .",
    "one can check that the inequality is saturated by any strategy of the form @xmath402 or @xmath403 .",
    "this thus define @xmath404 points saturating   in @xmath53 .",
    "since all points @xmath401 are linearly independent ( they form a basis of a @xmath405 dimensional space ) , these vectors are all linearly independent except for duplicates .",
    "there are @xmath406 duplicates , of the form @xmath407 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath408 linearly independent points in the allowed set of correlations which saturate  .",
