    "the _ geodesic growth function _ of a group @xmath0 with respect to a finite generating set @xmath1 counts , for each positive integer @xmath2 , the number of geodesics of length @xmath2 starting at @xmath3 in the cayley graph of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the _ geodesic growth series _ is the formal series that takes the values of the geodesic growth function as series coefficients ( see definition [ defgrowth ] ) .",
    "one of the first beautiful results in this area states that the geodesic growth series of a hyperbolic group , with respect to any finite generating set , is a rational function .",
    "this follows from the fact that the language of geodesics is regular @xcite .",
    "such behaviour also appears in other important classes of groups : artin groups of large ( @xcite ) and spherical ( @xcite ) type , coxeter groups ( @xcite ) , garside groups over the garside generators ( @xcite ) , or orientable surface groups of finite genus ( @xcite ) , to name just a few .",
    "however , unlike standard ( spherical ) group growth , geodesic growth is highly sensitive to the generating set . by an example due to cannon ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark ) , there is a group @xmath0 and generating sets @xmath1 and @xmath4 such that @xmath0 has a regular set of geodesics with respect to @xmath1 , and non - regular with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , some inroads have been made into understanding those groups that posses generating sets for which the geodesic growth is polynomial @xcite .",
    "the groups that we treat in this paper , right - angled and even coxeter and right - angled artin groups , are known to have a regular language of geodesics , and therefore rational geodesic growth series , with respect to the standard generating sets ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.8.3 ) , for proofs of these facts ) .",
    "our goal here is to give more qualitative information on the geodesic growth .",
    "more precisely , this paper was motivated by the following question :    ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 1 ) can two different right - angled artin groups have the same geodesic growth series ?    the answer , stated in corollaries [ cor : sameggc ] and [ cor : samegga ] , is positive :    _ let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two right - angled artin or coxeter groups based on link - regular graphs that have the same @xmath7-polynomial and the same size link for each clique of a given dimension . then @xmath5 and @xmath6 have the same geodesic growth series . _",
    "this is one of our main results , and it is proved in section [ mt ] .",
    "there we analyze the automata that recognize the geodesic languages of the two given groups and make use of their properties to reach the criteria in the hypothesis . this result and its proof",
    "was inspired by an analogous statement for automatic growth of right - angled coxeter groups in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 14 ) , where a different definition of link - regularity is used . in section [ relation ]",
    "we prove that the two definitions of link - regularity are in fact equivalent .",
    "when one sets the additional condition that the graphs that determine the groups be triangle - free , the result also follows from employing the growth formula for languages defined by ` forbidden words ' , as introduced in @xcite .",
    "this line of proof can then be generalized to even coxeter groups , which is the topic of section [ evencoxeter ] .",
    "the rigid chains of forbidden words for triangle - free even coxeter groups are described in lemmas [ lem : rigidsequence1 ] and [ lem : rigidsequence2 ] and this characterization is used to obtain the main result of section [ evencoxeter ] :    * theorem 6.15*.    _ let @xmath8 be an even coxeter system with graph @xmath9 suppose that @xmath10 is triangle - free , and star - regular , that is , the stars of any two vertices in @xmath10 are isomorphic as graphs .",
    "then the geodesic growth function depends only on @xmath11 and the isomorphism class of the star of the vertices .",
    "_    in particular , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are triangle - free , star - regular , even coxeter systems with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 have the same geodesic growth .    while we found sufficient conditions for two right - angled artin or coxeter groups to have the same geodesic growth , we have not found necessary conditions for this to happen . for example , it is not clear whether a pair of groups based on two non - isomorphic trees can have the same geodesic or same automatic growth .",
    "we discuss some of the connections between the spherical , automatic and geodesic growth of right - angled coxeter groups in section [ relation ] , and give a formula for the geodesic growth of the key players in this paper , the right - angled coxeter groups based on regular triangle - free graphs , in section [ sec : formula ] .",
    "the appendix contains a description of the geodesic words that represent elements in the centralizers of generators in even coxeter groups .",
    "this is used in the proof of theorem [ thmevencoxeter ] , and is basically a result of bahls and mihalik @xcite .",
