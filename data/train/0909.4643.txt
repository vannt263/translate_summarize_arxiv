    "hybrid stars are main - sequence variables which show two different types of oscillations : ( i ) low - order acoustic and gravity modes of @xmath1cephei type with periods of about @xmath4 hours , and ( ii ) high - order gravity modes of the spb type with periods of about @xmath5 days",
    ". pulsations of both types of variables are driven by the iron opacity bump located at temperature of about @xmath2  k ( z  bump ) . in the hr diagram",
    ", the overlapping region of the @xmath6cep and spb type variables is very sensitive to the opacity data ( figs.3 and 4 in @xcite , see also @xcite ) , therefore the modelling of hybrid star pulsations allows to test the opacity of the stellar matter .",
    "it was suggested by @xcite that an opacity enhancement around the z bump could help solving the problems in seismic modelling of the hybrid variable @xmath7eri .",
    "we tested this possibility in @xcite .",
    "there is also another iron opacity bump , referred to as deep opacity bump ( dob ) , at a temperature of about @xmath3  k , which may be responsible for the excitation of g - modes in hot massive wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "an opacity enhancement in the dob temperature region ( more exactly , at the base of the solar convection zone ) was suggested recently to achieve agreement between new solar models and helioseismic inferences @xcite .",
    "here , we construct seismic models of the hybrid variable @xmath0  pegasi , using the opal  @xcite and op  @xcite data on stellar opacities for two heavy element mixtures : gn93  @xcite and a04  @xcite .",
    "we show that some opacity enhancements around the z bump and deep opacity bump may be required to achieve a better agreement between the theoretical frequency range of unstable modes and the observed pulsations , and also to achieve a better fit of the computed individual frequencies to the observed values .",
    "recent photometric and spectroscopic observations of @xmath0  pegasi @xcite revealed 6 frequencies of the spb type and 8 of the @xmath1cep type pulsations .",
    "two modes were definitively identified : the radial fundamental mode at @xmath8  cd@xmath9 and the dipole mode @xmath10 at 6.0162  cd@xmath9 .",
    "preliminary seismic model from @xcite fits these two modes . in our study",
    "we suggested that the observed peak at 6.9776  cd@xmath9 corresponds to the acoustic dipole mode @xmath11 .",
    "our seismic models were constructed to fit these three frequencies by a suitable choice of stellar mass , @xmath12 , heavy element abundance , @xmath13 , and effective temperature .",
    "this method was used also in our studies of @xmath7eri @xcite .",
    "the position of the seismic models built with standard opacity data is shown on fig.1 .",
    "standard models do nt solve all the problems , which are similar to those encountered in the modelling of @xmath14eri @xcite : * ( i ) *  the theoretical frequency range of the unstable high - order gravity modes of lowest degrees does not fit the observed range . in op models",
    "only quadruple modes are unstable in the observed frequency range , whereas the observed frequency spacings argue mainly in favour of dipole modes . in the opal case ,",
    "spb type pulsations are not excited at all . *",
    "( ii ) *  in models within the observational error box in the hrd ( the opal model and preliminary model from @xcite ) , the theoretical frequency of the dipole mode @xmath15 is noticeably higher than the observed value 9.109  cd@xmath9 .",
    "op models fit this value much better but they are located outside the observational error box in the hrd . * ( iii ) *  all observed frequencies higher than 8  cd@xmath9 are outside the theoretical frequency range of unstable modes . * ( iv ) *  observations suggest rather low metallicity ( up to @xmath16 ) , whereas one needs much higher @xmath13 values to explain the mode excitation in the whole observed frequency range .",

    "the position of the modified seismic model in the hr diagram is almost the same as that of the standard model ( see fig.4 below ) .",
    "however , the opacity enhancement results in an extension of the unstable frequency range because just the z bump is responsible for the driving of both spb and @xmath1cep type pulsations , see fig.2 .",

    "to explain the observed frequency spectrum of the hybrid variable @xmath0  pegasi , the stellar matter seems to be still more opaque around the iron opacity bumps at temperatures of about @xmath2  k ( z bump ) and @xmath3  k ( dob ) than given by the standard models constructed with the opal or op data . a model with an opacity enhancement ( over the op a04 data ) of 50% in the z bump region and of 16% in the dob region",
