    "there are certainly many other possible choices that lead to integrable systems on spaces of non - constant curvature with deformed @xmath0 coalgebra symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , the explicit form of such a general hamiltonian can be restricted by taking into account the following requirements : ( i )  the kinetic energy is quadratic in the momenta , ( ii )  the limit @xmath2 of the underlying deformed spaces leads to @xmath166 , ( iii )  dimensions of the deformation parameter are @xmath167=[j_-]^{-1}=[q_i]^{-2}$ ] , and ( iv )  the potential only depends on the coordinates . under these assumptions",
    "the most general integrable hamiltonian is just ( [ ahaa ] ) ; notice that the case @xmath168 is transformed into a particular case of ( [ ahaa ] ) through the casimir @xmath13 .",
    "hence the ( deformed ) kinetic energy and potential of the resulting hamiltonian , @xmath169 , turn out to be & & t_z = 12 ( e^z q_2 ^ 2 p_1 ^ 2 + e^-z q_1 ^ 2 p_2 ^ 2 ) f(z(q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2 ) ) [ zb ] + & & v_z =( e^z q_2 ^ 2 + e^-z q_1 ^ 2 ) f(z(q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2 ) ) + ( z(q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2 ) ) . [ zc ]",
    "we remark that the general expression for the gaussian curvature of the 2d space associated with the kinetic energy ( [ zb ] ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "then it can be checked that in order to obtain a space of constant curvature from @xmath170 the choice is quite singular ( e.g. , @xmath171 ) , and in general one obtains very involved spaces of non - constant curvature for which the simplest choice is the one we have developed in this paper with @xmath172 . however other deformed spaces underlying ( [ zb ] ) and particular potentials contained in ( [ zc ] ) could be worth to be studied .",
    "other approaches to superintegrability on 2d spaces of variable curvature can be found in  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "we stress that by introducing a second parameter @xmath38 , that determines the signature of the metric , we have been able to obtain integrable potentials on relativistic spacetimes of non - constant curvature ; in this context , the deformed kc potential could be of interest in classical gravity .",
    "furthermore the known superintegrable sw potential on riemannian spaces have also been implemented on the three classical relativistic spacetimes of constant curvature .",
    "notice that we have avoided the contraction @xmath173 , which is well defined on both metrics ( [ cg ] ) and ( [ ee ] ) , since this would give rise to degenerate ( newtonian ) metrics , whose dynamical contents are not so interesting .",
    "finally , we recall that the existence of an underlying coalgebra symmetry for all these two - particle hamiltonians ensures that they can be generalized to @xmath174-dimensional spaces through the coproduct .",
    "in fact , the corresponding expressions in terms of the initial phase space @xmath100 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the geometrical and physical description of the corresponding hamiltonians on @xmath174d curved riemannian and relativistic spaces ( thus including a proper study of sectional curvatures ) remains as an open problem which is currently under investigation .",
