    "since more than ten years , interference phenomena in open quantum systems are studied theoretically in the framework of different models .",
    "common to all these studies is the appearance of different time scales as soon as the resonance states start to overlap ( see @xcite and references in these papers to older ones ) .",
    "some of the states align with the decay channels and become short - lived while the remaining ones decouple to a great deal from the continuum of decay channels and become long - lived .",
    "the wavefunctions show permanent changes : they are mixed strongly in the basic wavefunctions of the corresponding closed system .    in many - body systems",
    "the interaction is caused , above all , by two - body forces between the constituents of the system . the additional interaction connected with avoided level crossings",
    "is believed , usually , to lead only to an exchange of the wavefunctions but not to permanent changes of their structure .",
    "this conclusion results from many spectroscopic studies on closed systems with discrete states .",
    "recent investigations in the framework of a schematical model @xcite showed however that , in the case of collective resonance states , permanent changes in the wavefunctions occur due to the interplay between the real and imaginary parts of the different coupling matrix elements .",
    "the mixing of the resonance states of a microwave resonator is not caused by two - body forces .",
    "a mixing of the states may occur only as a result of avoided level crossings .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question whether or not some permanent mixing in the wavefunctions of a microwave cavity can arise . in @xcite ,",
    "the changes in the structure of the wavefunctions at avoided crossings in a strongly driven ( closed ) square potential well system are studied .",
    "the avoided crossings are shown to lead , in some cases , to temporary and , in other cases , to permanent changes as a function of driving field strength .",
    "the avoided level crossings are related to exceptional points in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the coupling induced by avoided level crossings is therefore surely connected with the coupling matrix elements of the discrete states of the closed system to the continuum . in the continuum shell model ,",
    "these coupling matrix elements are complex @xcite .",
    "interferences appear when more than one channel are open .",
    "it is possible therefore that interferences of different type may provide eventually a permanent mixing of the wavefunctions of the resonance states .",
    "a similar study for microwave cavities does not exist .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to study the resonance picture of an open microwave resonator in detail .",
    "we show that its characteristic features are the same as those which are known from open many - body quantum systems .",
    "this means that not only two - body forces play a role for the interaction among the resonance states but also the interaction @xmath2 via the continuum is important .",
    "neither @xmath9 nor @xmath4 can be neglected , generally .",
    "they are important near avoided crossings in the complex plane and their interplay can not be neglected when @xmath9 and @xmath4 are of the same order of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "permanent changes in the structure of the wavefunctions appear , as a rule .",
    "the basic assumptions of the statistical theory ( random matrix theory ) are fulfilled only when the interferences caused by the hermitian and anti - hermitian parts of the hamiltonian can be neglected to a good approximation . this is the case e.g. for a gaussian orthogonal ensemble coupled weakly to the continuum .    in section 2 of the present paper ,",
    "the hamiltonian of an open quantum system and the relation of its eigenvalues to the poles of the @xmath6-matrix is considered .",
    "the formalism can be applied to a many - body system as well as to a microwave resonator .",
    "the hamiltonian is non - hermitian and the eigenvalues provide the energies as well as the widths of the states . in section 3 , the avoided crossing of two resonance states is traced .",
    "the differences between the mixing of the states due to the hermitian and the anti - hermitian part of @xmath0 are the central point of discussion .",
    "the hermitian part causes an equilibration of the states in relation to the time scale which is accompanied by level repulsion along the real axis ( energy ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the anti - hermitian part leads to an attraction of the levels in energy and to a bifurcation of the widths ( formation of different time scales ) .",
    "these processes are characteristic for the interplay among resonances which takes place locally in more complicated systems @xcite .    in section 4 ,",
    "the resonance structure of a rectangular microwave resonator coupled to one lead is studied . inside",
    "the resonator is a circular scatter .",
    "level repulsion in the complex plane appears . it can be seen sometimes as level repulsion along the real energy axis . in other cases",
    ", a bifurcation of the widths occurs .",
    "the changes in the structure of the wavefunctions are permanent , as a rule .",
    "collective states are formed at strong coupling to the lead .",
    "the structure of their wavefunctions has almost nothing in common with the structure of the wavefunctions of these states at small coupling .",
    "together with the collective states , long - lived trapped states appear .",
    "the conductance of the microwave resonator is studied after coupling it to a second lead .",
    "the conductance peaks are determined by the poles of the @xmath6-matrix , which move as a function of the coupling strength between cavity and leads .",
    "the results are discussed in section 5 and some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the function space of an open quantum system consists of two parts : the subspace of discrete states ( @xmath14-subspace ) and the subspace of scattering states ( @xmath15-subspace ) .",
    "the discrete states are the states of the closed system which are embedded into the continuum of scattering states . due to the coupling of the discrete states to the continuum",
    ", they can decay and get a finite lifetime .",
    "let us define two sets of wavefunctions by solving first the schrdinger equation @xmath16 for the discrete states of the closed system and secondly the schrdinger equation @xmath17 for the scattering states of the environment .",
    "note that the closed system can be a many - particle quantum system or a system like a microwave resonator .",
    "the only condition is that it can be described quantum mechanically by the hermitian hamilton operator @xmath18 . in the case of the flat microwave resonator ,",
    "this is possible by using the analogy to the helmholtz equation .",
    "then , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 operators can be defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in order to perform spectroscopic studies , we do not use any statistical assumptions ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath21 , we can determine a third wavefunction by solving the scattering problem @xmath22 with source term .",
    "the source term is determined by the coupling matrix elements @xmath23 between the two subspaces .",
    "further , we identify @xmath18 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the schrdinger equation in the total function space @xmath26 .",
    "then , the solution @xmath27 in the total function space is @xcite @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the effective hamilton operator appearing in the @xmath14-subspace due to the coupling to the continuum , @xmath30 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath0 and @xmath31 its eigenvalues .",
    "they provide the wavefunctions , energies and widths , respectively , of the resonance states .",
    "the @xmath23 are the coupling matrix elements between the discrete states @xmath32 and the continuum of scattering states @xmath33 , while the @xmath34 are those between the resonance states @xmath35 and the continuum .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath2 consist of the principal value integral and the residuum @xcite , @xmath36 here , @xmath37 are the channels which open at the energies @xmath38 .",
    "they describe the external mixing of two states via the continuum of decay channels . as a rule ,",
    "both parts @xmath9 and @xmath4 are non - vanishing .",
    "note , the expressions ( [ eq : wf1 ] ) , ( [ eq : heff ] ) and ( [ eq : extmi1 ] ) follow by formal rewriting the schrdinger equation @xmath25 with the only condition that @xmath14 and @xmath39 are defined in such a manner that the channel wavefunctions of the @xmath15 subspace are uncoupled @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath0 have no physical meaning . the @xmath40 and @xmath35 are energy dependent functions , generally .",
    "the resonance part of the @xmath6-matrix is @xcite @xmath41 we underline that the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath35 are functions which are calculated inside the formalism .",
    "they contain the contributions of @xmath4 and of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are complex .",
    "in order to illustrate the mutial influence of two neighboured resonance states , we consider the following hamilton operator @xmath44 which describes two resonance states lying at the energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these two states have the widths @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , and are coupled by @xmath49 ( where @xmath49 is real ) .",
    "the eigenvalues are : @xmath50 when @xmath51 , the coupling @xmath49 of the two states leads to level repulsion along the real axis .",
    "numerical results for @xmath52 are shown in figure [ fig : eigenwf].a .",
    "let us now consider the hamiltonian with the coupling @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is real ) of the two states via the continuum , @xmath55 in this case , the eigenvalues are : @xmath56 for @xmath57 , the coupling via the continuum due to @xmath53 leads to repulsion along the imaginary axis ( bifurcation of the widths ) , i.e. to resonance trapping .",
    "numerical results for @xmath58 are shown in figure [ fig : eigenwf].d .    as it is well known and can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : avoi2 ] ) , two interacting discrete states ( @xmath59 ) can not cross . in the complex plane , however , the conditions for crossing of two resonance states may be fulfilled . from @xmath60",
    ", it follows @xmath61 for the general case of a complex interaction @xmath62 .",
    "these conditions define the critical values of the coupling strength ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively ) at which the @xmath6-matrix has a branch point @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that two resonance states cross along the real or imaginary axis while the crossing is avoided along the other axis .",
    "the conditions for such a case with @xmath65 are @xmath66 for crossing along the real axis and @xmath67 for crossing along the imaginary axis .",
    "the crossing in the complex plane is avoided , in any case .",
    "the trajectories for the motion of the eigenvalues in the complex plane as a function of the interaction @xmath49 and @xmath54 , respectively , ( figures [ fig : eigenwf].a and d ) show the avoided crossing of the two resonance states in the complex plane .",
    "it occurs at a certain critical value of the coupling strength . here and in its neighbourhood",
    "a redistribution between the two states takes place .",
    "it is accompanied by the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions @xmath68 of @xmath0 , @xmath69 .",
    "the wavefunctions of the two resonance states become mixed : @xmath70 where the @xmath71 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath72 , which is the hamilton operator with vanishing non - diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively ) . in figures [ fig :",
    "eigenwf].b , c and e , f , the coefficients @xmath75 are shown as a function of the coupling strength @xmath49 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the results can be summarized in the following manner .",
    "+    * weak interaction @xmath76 or @xmath77 : + the resonance states are isolated , their positions and widths are almost independent of the value of @xmath49 and @xmath78 , respectively",
    ". + @xmath79 . + * starting at a certain critical value of the coupling strength , the behaviour of the system is different for the two cases with @xmath49 and @xmath54 .",
    "+ @xmath80 : the states start to repel in energy and to attract each other along the imaginary axis ( if their widths at small @xmath49 are different ) .",
    "+ @xmath81 : the widths bifurcate and the levels attract each other along the real axis ( if their positions in energy at small @xmath54 are different ) .",
    "+ in both cases @xmath82 .",
    "the wavefunctions of the two states become mixed . + * @xmath83 : the widths are almost independent of @xmath49 : ( equilibration in relation to the time scale ) and the states repel each other along the real axis ( level repulsion ) .",
    "+ @xmath84 : the energies are almost independent of @xmath54 ( the two states remain close to one another in their position ) and resonance trapping occurs ( the width of one of the states increases with increasing @xmath54 , while the width of the other state decreases ) . + in both cases @xmath85 .    from a mathematical point of view , the properties of the system at an avoided crossing in the complex plane ( i.e. in the region of the critical coupling strength @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively ) are almost the same : repulsion of the eigenvalues along one axis and attraction along the other axis .",
    "the physical meaning is , however , very different : @xmath49 causes equilibrium ( in relation to the lifetime ) and level repulsion along the real axis while @xmath53 creates different time scales ( bifurcation of the widths ) and level attraction along the real axis .",
    "when the coupling contains both @xmath49 and @xmath53 , then it depends on the ratio between the two parts whether level repulsion or attraction along the real axis dominates . in any case",
    ", the crossing of states is avoided in the complex plane and results in a complicated interference picture .",
    "the wavefunctions of the resonance states are mixed permanently in the set of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath72 of the corresponding closed system .      in @xcite , the behaviour of poles of the @xmath6-matrix in an open two - dimensional regular microwave billiard connected to a single waveguide",
    "is studied . as a function of the coupling strength between the resonator and the waveguide ,",
    "the position of the correponding resonance poles , the wavefunctions of the resonance states and the wigner - smith time delay function are calculated .",
    "the poles are calculated on the basis of the exterior complex scaling method .",
    "the energy of the incoming wave is chosen so that only the channel corresponding to the first transversal mode in the lead is open .    in @xcite",
    ", the bifurcation of the widths ( resonance trapping ) can be seen very clearly , indeed .",
    "in particular , the contraintuitive result that the lifetimes of certain resonance states increase with increasing coupling to the continuum can be traced not only in the motion of the poles of the @xmath6-matrix in the complex plane .",
    "it can be seen also in the wavefunctions of the resonance states and , above all , in the measurable time - delay function . in the case of three interfering resonance states ,",
    "the wavefunction of ( at most ) one of the long - lived trapped states may be pure in relation to the bound states of the closed resonator @xcite . more exactly : @xmath86 at small and large coupling strength .",
    "some mixing of all three wavefunctions appears in the critical region where the wavefunctions are biorthogonal ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "another example is the motion of the poles of the @xmath6-matrix by varying the coupling strength between the states of an atom by means of a laser . in @xcite ,",
    "the positions and widths of two resonances in the vicinity of an autoionizing state coupled to another autoionizing one ( or a discrete state ) by a strong laser field are considered . for different atomic parameters , the trajectories in the complex energy plane",
    "are traced by fixing the field frequency @xmath88 but varying the intensity @xmath89 of the laser field .",
    "the states are coupled directly as well as via a common continuum and the ratio of these couplings is defined by the fano parameter @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "most interesting is the region of avoided resonance crossing where the motion of each eigenvalue trajectory is influenced strongly by the motion of the other one .",
    "this occurs at a certain critical intensity @xmath90 . when furthermore the frequency is equally to the critical value @xmath91 , then laser induced degenerate states arising at the double pole of the @xmath6-matrix are formed .",
    "the strong correlation between the two states for intensities around @xmath90 reflects itself in the strong changes of the shape parameters of the resonances in the cross section .",
    "it can therefore be traced .    in the limit of vanishing direct coupling ( @xmath92 ) ,",
    "the widths bifurcate at @xmath93 as in other open quantum systems .",
    "that means , the width of one of the resonance states increases with increasing @xmath94 while the width of the other decreases relatively to the first one . in the limit @xmath95 , the ratio between the width of the long - lived and short - lived state approaches zero ( resonance trapping ) .",
    "this corresponds to the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenwf].d . in the other limiting case , the coupling via the continuum vanishes ( @xmath14 value large ) . here , the levels repel in their energetic positions when @xmath96 .",
    "this corresponds to fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenwf].a .    in any case",
    ", i.e. for _ all _ @xmath14 values , the two resonance states start to repel each other in the _ complex _ energy plane at @xmath97 .",
    "the repulsion of the eigenvalues in the complex plane is an expression of the strong mutual influence of one state on the other one in the critical region around @xmath98 . in the transition region ( @xmath14 values of the order of magnitude 1 ) , the trajectories show a complicated behaviour . here , population trapping may appear , i.e. the width of one of the resonance states may vanish at a certain finite intensity @xmath99 .",
    "it appears , generally , if the process is neither pure level repulsion on the real axis nor pure resonance trapping but the amplitudes of both processes ( i.e. the direct coupling of the two states and their coupling via the continuum ) are of comparable importance and interfere .",
    "thus , the results obtained in @xcite for two interacting atomic levels confirm qualitatively the results of the schematical study represented in section 3.1 , although not only the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath100 but also the width @xmath47 itself depends on @xmath89 .",
    "these results and those for the microwave cavity discussed above show very clearly that individual resonance states can mix not only due to the two - body forces between the substituents of the system _ but also _ as a consequence of avoided resonance crossings .",
    "other realistic cases are considered in @xcite .",
    "these are the resonance doublet @xmath101 in the nucleus @xmath102be and the @xmath103 doublet of mesons .",
    "the calculations are performed for a rectangular flat resonator coupled to a waveguide . inside the cavity , a circular scatter is placed .",
    "we use the dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath104 , on the border of the billiard and of the waveguide .",
    "the waveguide has a width equal to @xmath105 and is attached to the resonator through a slide with an adjustable opening ( which is described also by the dirichlet boundary condition ) . for @xmath106",
    "the resonator and the waveguide are disconnected , while @xmath107 represents the maximal coupling ( opening ) .",
    "the cavity has a minimum area @xmath108 which is determined by @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( compare figure [ fig : cavity ] ) .",
    "the area is varied by varying @xmath111 or @xmath112 while both the position of the lead and the scatter inside the cavity remain unchanged .",
    "we solve the equation @xmath113 inside the waveguide , the wavefunction has the asymptotic form @xmath114 here @xmath115 is the transversal mode in the waveguide , @xmath116 is the wave number and @xmath117 is the reflection coefficient .",
    "the energies and widths of the resonance states are given by the poles of the coefficient @xmath117 analytically continued into the lower complex plane .",
    "they are identical to the poles of the @xmath6 matrix when the fixed point equations for the @xmath118 and @xmath119 are solved ( see section 2 ) .    to find the poles we use the method of exterior complex scaling @xcite",
    ". for details see @xcite .",
    "we studied the motion of the poles of the @xmath6 matrix as a function of the area of the resonator by changing both its length @xmath120 and width @xmath121 .",
    "the changes of the corresponding wavefunctions @xmath122 are traced .",
    "we studied the energy region between the two thresholds at @xmath123 and @xmath124 where only one channel is open .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eigenxy ] , the eigenvalue picture is shown for @xmath125 ( aperture partly closed by the slide ) and @xmath107 ( aperture fully open ) for different values of the length and width of the resonator . in all cases ,",
    "oscillations of the widths as a function of @xmath112 or @xmath111 in the energy region considered can be seen .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations are larger for larger widths . at @xmath125 , all states corresponding to different @xmath126  ( @xmath127 ) and lying around 24 have small widths .",
    "this is caused , obviously , by certain symmetry properties of the wavefunctions in relation to the channel ( since this energy is in the middle between the two thresholds ) .",
    "the minimum in the widths vanishes when the wavefunctions are strongly mixed via the continuum ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this shows that the coupling to the channel washes out some spectroscopic properties of the closed system .    for @xmath125 ,",
    "the energies and widths of the states lying in the energy region around 24 are shown in figure [ fig : eigen10y ] as a function of @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath128 show typical avoided crossings while the picture of the @xmath129 is more complicated .",
    "for the three states denoted by diamonds , stars and circles , respectively , the wavefunctions are shown in figure [ fig : wf10y3 ] for 10 different neighboured values of @xmath112 .",
    "two states ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) cross freely in the energy at @xmath132 .",
    "the wavefunctions of the two states @xmath130 and @xmath131 are very different from one another and the interaction due to @xmath9 between them is obviously small .",
    "the wavefunctions of both states do almost not change in the crossing region . only in the widths",
    ", some repulsion can be seen caused obviously by @xmath4 .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ fig : free ] where the results are shown from a calculation with smaller steps in @xmath112 around the free crossing .",
    "around @xmath133 , the state @xmath130 avoids crossing in energy with the other state ( @xmath134 ) at some value @xmath135 ( around -3.63 ) . in this region ,",
    "the wave functions of both states become strongly mixed , their widths become comparable and cross . the repulsion in their energies",
    "can be seen .",
    "the avoided crossing is caused mainly by @xmath9 . beyond the critical region ,",
    "the wavefunctions of the two states remain mixed although some hint to their exchange can be seen .",
    "these results show that avoided level crossing in the complex plane can be seen in the projection onto the energy axis or in the projection onto the width axis . in the first case",
    ", @xmath9 dominates while in the second case , the mixing of the states occurs mainly due to @xmath4 .",
    "according to the oscillations of the widths and the varying number of states as a function of the length or width of the resonator , the sum of the widths of all states , lying between the two thresholds , fluctuates as a function of these values . in figure",
    "[ fig : gasum ] ( bottom ) , we show the number @xmath136 of states as a function of @xmath112 ( for @xmath137 ) .",
    "this number increases since the number of states moving from above into the energy region considered is larger than the number of states leaving it to get bound . on the average , @xmath138 is constant for a fixed value of @xmath139 with fluctuations smaller than 10 % .",
    "this can be seen from the example with @xmath137 shown in figure [ fig : gasum ] ( top ) . the coupling of the cavity to the lead is therefore characterized by @xmath139 but not by the area of the cavity .      in figure",
    "[ fig : eigenw ] , we show the eigenvalue picture obtained by varying @xmath139 from 0.4 ( almost closed aperture ) to 0 ( fully open aperture ) .",
    "the width of the resonator is determined by @xmath140 and the length by the two neighboured values @xmath141 ( figure [ fig : eigenw ] top ) and @xmath142 ( figure [ fig : eigenw ] bottom ) . in both cases ,",
    "collective states are formed .",
    "they are formed in regions where the level density is comparably high . even at full opening of the aperture",
    ", the collective states belonging to the different groups do not overlap .",
    "thus , they scarcely mix via the continuum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wf3y ] , we show the wavefunctions of the collective states from the lower part of figure [ fig : eigenw ] .",
    "although the wavefunctions of the collective states are very different from one another at small opening of the aperture @xmath143 , they are similar at full opening @xmath144 ( figures [ fig : wf3y].d , f ) where they have large amplitudes near to the aperture . the state shown in the middle ( figure [ fig : wf3y].e )",
    "is trapped by the state to the left ( figure [ fig : wf3y].d ) at a comparably large opening ( compare figure [ fig : eigenw ] bottom ) .",
    "the wavefunctions of the collective states at @xmath107 in the long and in the broad resonators ( @xmath145 ) are also similar to those shown in figures [ fig : wf3y].d and [ fig : wf3y].f .",
    "the conductance of the resonator is described by the matrix elements @xmath146 , equation ( [ eq : smares ] ) , where @xmath147 is the channel of the incoming wave and @xmath148 that of the outgoing wave . in our calculations ,",
    "the second lead is on the lower right corner of the cavity , symmetrically to the first lead on the upper left corner .",
    "it is @xmath140 and @xmath110 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : condw ] , the conductance at three different coupling strengths to the leads is shown together with the eigenvalue picture . in the eigenvalue picture",
    ", one can see the formation of two short - lived states at large opening ( small @xmath139 ) in each group .",
    "this corresponds to the coupling of the resonator to two leads .",
    "it can be seen from the wavefunctions of the states that _ both _ short - lived states of each group are coupled strongly to _ both _ leads .",
    "the conductance is therefore large at large opening .    at low opening ( @xmath149 ) , the conductance peaks coincide with the resonance peaks . at larger opening ( @xmath150 and 0 )",
    ", the conductance is an interference picture created by the overlapping resonances .",
    "the influence of the short - lived resonances onto the conductance can clearly be seen .    in figure",
    "[ fig : condint ] , the conductance is integrated over the energy of each group ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) and plotted as a function of @xmath139 .",
    "the conductance at the higher energy increases quite rapidly in a small region of @xmath139 which corresponds to the critical region around @xmath153 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "as demonstrated in sections 3 and 4 , the wavefunctions of a quantum system mix under the influence of the hermitian as well as the anti - hermitian part of the hamiltonian .",
    "if the hermitian part of the hamiltonian is dominant then avoided crossing can be seen along the energy axis ( _ level repulsion _ ) .",
    "if the anti - hermitian part of the coupling via the continuum becomes important , then resonance trapping ( _ bifurcation of the widths _ ) appears . in general",
    ", both types of mixing appear and may interfere .",
    "note that this interaction between different states of a quantum system via the continuum does not require two - body forces between the constituents of the system .",
    "the states whose wavefunctions are shown in figure [ fig : wf10y3 ] lie in the energy region around 24 where the coupling to the continuum is small .",
    "the mixing of the states is varied by means of varying the area of the resonator . in the upper part of the related figure [ fig : eigen10y ]",
    ", we see typical avoided level crossings in the energies @xmath128 . here , the widths of the two states become comparable with one another .",
    "this implies that @xmath9 is decisive for the process . in this case , the results are similar to those known very well from studies on closed systems with discrete states ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "we see , however , also the opposite case : the crossing of the states @xmath130 and @xmath131 in figure [ fig : eigen10y ] is free along the real axis while the widths repel each other . in this case , @xmath9 is obviously small ( the wavefunctions of the two states are very different from one another , figure [ fig : wf10y3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 is decisive , and the levels can , according to section 3.1 , cross along the real axis .",
    "the variation of the widths of the resonance states as a function of the coupling strength to the continuum is traced in figure [ fig : eigenw ] . in each group of overlapping states ,",
    "one collective state is formed whose structure is determined by the channel wavefunction .",
    "this can be seen very clearly by comparing the wavefunctions of the different collective states which are similar to one another but have almost nothing in common with the original wavefunctions of these states at small opening of the aperture ( figure [ fig : wf3y ] ) . here",
    ", the variation of the external mixing occurs mainly in the @xmath4 : the approaching of the states of a group in their positions as well as the trapping of all but one state inside each group due to enlarging @xmath4 can be seen very clearly in figure [ fig : eigenw ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare figure [ fig : eigenw ] with the results for a slightly changed geometry of the cavity . in @xcite ,",
    "the disk is smaller and all states between the two thresholds belong to one group . according to this , only one broad state is formed at full opening of the slide .",
    "the avoided crossing of the two broad states in the lower part of figure [ fig : eigenw ] occurs according to the schematical picture with @xmath53 ( figure [ fig : eigenwf].d , level attraction and width bifurcation ) with the only difference that not only the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath0 depend on the coupling strength determined by @xmath54 , but also the diagonal ones .",
    "this case is studied in detail analytically and numerically in the framework of a schematical model in @xcite .    in @xcite , avoided level crossings in a closed resonator under the influence of a driving field are studied .",
    "the results show avoided level crossings with and without permanent mixing of the wavefunctions in a similar manner as in the open resonator studied by us .",
    "the relation between the peaks in the conductance , the wigner delay times and the positions of the states in the closed resonator is studied in @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper show that the conductance peaks are related to the positions of the resonance states in the _ open _ resonator .",
    "the peaks are , generally , the result of interferences between the resonance states .    altogether , the interplay between @xmath9 and @xmath4 leads , as a rule , to permanent mixings of the wavefunctions .",
    "level repulsion along the real axis is caused by @xmath9 while bifurcation of the widths ( resonance trapping ) is caused by @xmath4 .",
    "both processes may interfere . as a result",
    ", different time scales may appear and the energy dependency of the conductance changes with the degree of opening of the system in a non - trivial manner .",
    "the interaction @xmath2 of resonance states via the continuum of decay channels consists of the hermitian part @xmath9 and the anti - hermitian part @xmath4 .",
    "both terms have to be considered not only in a many - body system @xcite but also in the micro - wave billiard as shown in the present paper .",
    "some results show the dominance of @xmath4 , others the dominance of @xmath9 .",
    "the avoided crossing of the resonance states in the complex plane may appear , under certain conditions , as a free crossing along the real axis or along the imaginary axis .",
    "the interplay between the hermitian and anti - hermitian parts of the coupling operator between two resonance states via a common continuum may lead , in some cases , to a bifurcation of the widths ( resonance trapping ) .",
    "in other cases , it may lead to a repulsion of the states along the real energy axis .",
    "the interaction @xmath2 introduces , as a rule , permanent changes in the wavefunctions of the resonance states . under certain conditions ,",
    "the system may be stabilized dynamically @xcite .",
    "the resonance picture of a microwave resonator shows all the characteristic features which are known from open quantum systems with two - body forces between the constituents .",
    "this result means that the interaction between the resonance states at the avoided level crossings in the complex plane plays an important role for the mixing of the wavefunctions . as an example , the wavefunctions of the collective short - lived states are strongly mixed in the set of wavefunctions of the closed system .",
    "they are quite different from those of the original states at small coupling to the continuum .",
    "the statistical theory ( random matrix theory ) describes resonance states of an almost closed system .",
    "the poles of the @xmath6-matrix are near to the real axis and @xmath4 is small .",
    "the effective hamilton operator is @xmath154 where the @xmath155 are the coupling vectors between discrete and scattering states @xcite .",
    "the level repulsion along the real energy axis is embodied in @xmath156 by choosing , e.g. , the gaussian orthogonal ensemble . under these conditions ,",
    "the effects caused by the interplay between @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be neglected to a good approximation .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper show , however , that the situation is different when the system is really open , i.e. when @xmath8 and @xmath7 are of the _ same _ order of magnitude . in this case , the interplay between the two parts of @xmath0 causes _ non - negligible _ effects which are not considered in the statistical theory .",
    "the avoided crossing of resonance states in the complex plane embodies the interplay between resonance trapping and level repulsion along the real axis .",
