    "coloured quarks and gluons are the main objects in the fundamental theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which are not directly observed in experiment . at intermediate and low energies",
    "the laws governing interactions of these fundamental particles bring about complex rearrangements inside a quark - gluon system which eventually result in two - quark and three - quark colourless formations ",
    "a second transition appears at a comparable scale , namely the spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown , leading to the pseudo - goldstone boson octet .",
    "these phenomena can not be consistently described within perturbation theory in the strong coupling constant @xmath3 which is no longer small at the typical hadronic energy scale .",
    "therefore , it is mandatory to develop nonperturbative methods to solve these problems .",
    "there are few nonperturbative methods employed in particle physics .",
    "noteworthy are lattice field theory , quantization on the light cone , and qcd sum rules . despite all their advantages , these approaches have not yet lead to a unified description of confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown @xmath4 .",
    "both phenomena are supposed to arise from colour gauge interactions . yet",
    ", the complex process of hadron formation remains obscure .",
    "this stimulates numerous attempts to construct models aimed at describing individual major features of the process .",
    "one can find explanation of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in the nambu  jona - lasinio model , chiral quark model , approaches with stochastic vacuum fields , dual qcd , etc .",
    "a large class of such models involve path integral methods for calculation of green functions that approximate qcd in the infrared region .",
    "the guiding principle is iterative integration first with respect to rapidly varying fields and then with respect to slowly varying ones , an idea borrowed from the general theory of phase transitions .",
    "according to this idea , slow modes mainly determine the asymptotic behaviour of the system at small energies and momenta ( infrared asymptotics ) and require thorough study in terms of collective variables .",
    "the contribution from `` fast '' fields is less substantial and can be taken into account by perturbation theory .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite , on which we concentrate below , is one of these schemes .",
    "the boundary between `` slow '' and `` fast '' fields is largely conventional being dictated by physical considerations .",
    "the chiral @xmath5 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian is broken at energies of the order of @xmath6gev if small quark masses are ignored .",
    "this is what allows one to relate @xmath7 to the boundary between `` large '' and `` small '' momenta when looking into infrared qcd asymptotics from the symmetry point of view .",
    "chiral symmetry breakdown is a fundamental issue because it is related to the problem of elementary particle masses and chiral symmetry lends itself to a controlable expansion ( in energy ) at energies below @xmath7 . at these energies",
    "the qcd vacuum becomes highly non - perturbative due to the condensation of quark - antiquark pairs as a consequence of the spontaneous symmetry violation .",
    "it is believed that any serious model of the strong interactions has to account for these facts .",
    "this is the case for the celebrated njl model which was originally formulated not in terms of quark but rather nucleonic degrees of freedom . in what follows we",
    "will be concerned with a modern extension based on the quark description .",
    "assuming that the njl model in the form that involves all essential qcd symmetries may be a reasonable approximation of qcd in the intermediate energy range , we develop a new theoretical method .",
    "it allows arbitrary n - point functions describing strong and electroweak interactions of basic meson states to be calculated through the effective four - quark interaction of the njl model @xcite .",
    "now there are two approaches to the problem .",
    "one is based on the classical treatment of four - fermion lagrangians ( the hartree ",
    "fock approximation plus bethe  salpeter type equations for bound states ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the other involves explicit separation of collective degrees of freedom in the functional integral of the theory ( bosonization ) @xcite-@xcite . in this framework one",
    "usually derives the lagrangian based on a derivative expansion instead of directly calculating the green functions . for technical reasons , such a derivative expansion can only be performed to the first few orders .",
    "_ we have constructed such a formal scheme that at the same time incorporates bosonization and has all advantages of the pure fermionic approach . _",
    "it allows to combine the advantages of both of the abovementioned methods .",
    "the results of our more general method can be directly compared with the ones based on standard bosonization by performing a chiral expansion based on the nonlinear bethe ",
    "salpeter equations .",
    "originally formulated in terms of boson variables linearly transforming with respect to the chiral group action , the method can be extended to nonlinear realization of symmetry .",
    "this is one of the significant advantages of the approach as compared with hartree and fock s classical technique , which is linear is this sense .",
    "now chiral symmetry consequences are often investigated via nonlinear chiral lagrangians .",
    "they are a series in energy @xmath8 , which is equivalent to normal expansion with an increasing number of derivatives . as a rule",
    ", investigations are mostly confined to the @xmath9 approximation . recently",
    "a program like this was used for the extended njl model @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show how one can generalize these results without any reference to an expansion in @xmath10 .    apart from pure theoretical developments to generalize the results of @xcite",
    ", we carry out explicit calculations .",
    "our primary concern is the @xmath0 scattering amplitude .",
    "we shall calculate it both in the linear and nonlinear approaches using the standard lagrangian of the extended njl model with scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector four - quark interactions .",
    "we show that there is no difference between these two approaches .",
    "the expressions for the total amplitude @xmath11 are the same in both cases .",
    "it has to be so because the same lagrangian is used .",
    "we consider this point in detail to show the self - consistency of our method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the lagrangian and notation as well as review the main steps of the momentum - space bosonization technique .",
    "we then consider the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "we shall show that in this case equations for masses of bound states coincide with analogous equations in the linear approach .",
    "the expression for the weak pion decay constant @xmath1 does not change either .",
    "all this allows us to get common rules for constructing chiral expansions in the linear and nonlinear approaches . in section 3",
    "we derive the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes and the main low - energy characteristics of the process in question .",
    "theoretical derivations of the previous section will be the starting point .",
    "at first we shall use the model with linear realization of chiral symmetry . in this section",
    "our calculations are an extension of earlier investigations [ 2 , 15 ] .",
    "the corresponding amplitude includes the exchange of scalar and vector mesons as well as quark box diagrams .",
    "we give explicit expressions for this amplitude in terms of a few standard integrals .",
    "we obtain the low - energy expansion for the scattering amplitude and recover weinberg s @xcite formula ( to lowest order in the energy expansion ) . examining the model arising from classification of collective excitations based on nonlinear representations of the chiral group , we arrive at the same expression for the @xmath0 scattering amplitude .",
    "we demonstrate this point by direct calculations and comparing the different contributions . in this part of the paper we not only generalize the known result of @xcite",
    ", we also prove the equivalence of this approach with the other known results .",
    "our method looks like a bridge between different njl models .",
    "finally we present our results , comparing different variants of the njl model with experiment and chiral perturbation results . in section 4",
    "we calculate the scalar form factor of the pion .",
    "we pay particular attention to its relation to the value of the constituent quark mass .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "in ref.@xcite the extended njl model was investigated and it was shown how to calculate fourier transforms of @xmath12-point green functions by a simple method which was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this calculation was done in the linear realization of chiral symmetry . in this section",
    "we are developing the method to apply it to the extended njl model with nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "to describe collective excitations we shall use induced representations of the chiral group .",
    "calculations of quark loop diagrams will involve renormalization of collective variables , as is typical of our approach . as a result , we are able to calculate amplitudes of physical processes to any accuracy in @xmath10 in models with nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry .      in this section",
    "we summarize previous results ( see also paper @xcite ) .",
    "the reader who is familiar with the momentum - space bosonization method can use this section as a collection of our notation and main formulae to be found in this paper .",
    "the main idea of this method consists in the construction of special bosonic variables to be used for the description of the observable mesonic states . as a result",
    ", it extends the usual treatment of bosonized njl models , which was formulated in @xcite and developed in [ 9,10,12 ] . the standard approach is essentially linked to the derivative expansion of the effective meson lagrangian .",
    "the momentum - space bosonization method does not use this approximation .",
    "it involves the bosonization procedure and has all the advantages of the pure fermionic approach ( hartree - fock plus bethe - salpeter approximation ) . instead of step - by - step construction of the effective lagrangian describing the dynamics of collective excitations",
    "we develop a method that allows direct calculation of amplitudes for particular physical processes .",
    "the amplitudes derived accumulate the entire information on the process under investigation , just as if we had a total effective meson lagrangian of the bosonized njl model ( in the one - loop approximation ) .",

    "there is a sum of two contributions to the scalar pion form factor in the njl model : one is the direct coupling of the operator @xmath312 ( double - dashed line ) to the two pions via a quark triangle ( we call it bare coupling ) , and the other corresponds to rescattering of quarks into the scalar meson @xmath313 , which in turn couples to the pions .",
    "in fig.7a we show these contributions , with the pion legs amputated . after solving the bethe  salpeter equation for this vertex , @xmath314 , one obtains the scalar pion form factor by attaching the pion legs , fig.7b . with eqs .",

    "these higher order effects are essentially accounted for by the low constituent quark mass in agreement with the findings of ref.@xcite .",
    "we stress again that alternatively one might want to consider pion loop effects , which , however , goes beyond the scope of the present manuscript .",
    "in the present paper we have developped a method which allows for the calculation of @xmath12-point functions within the extended nambu  jona - lasinio model with nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry @xcite . this extends the ideas described in @xcite . using the path integral technique and the hartree approximation , we work in momentum space to circumvent the standard way of employing the heat kernel expansion for constructing an effective meson lagrangian . with the heat kernel method ,",
    "one manages to get only the first few terms of the lagrangian ( in general the @xmath9 approximation ) and faces growing difficulties when calculating terms of yet higher orders .",
    "examining the one - loop approximation for the effective action in momentum space , we find transformations of collective variables which permit to calculate these higher order terms in a straightforward manner .",

    "we have demonstrated explicitely that the @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xmath11 obtained in both approaches is completely equivalent .",
    "we have carried out the chiral expansion for this amplitude and calculated the pertinent scattering lengths and range parameters .",
    "in addition we have obtained the corresponding low - energy @xmath334 phase shifts .",
    "all these calculations have been performed for two sets of parameters , the first and the second one having a large ( @xmath335 mev ) and a small ( @xmath336 mev ) constituent mass , respectively . in general",
    ", the conclusion is that the corrections derived by considering terms of the effective meson lagrangian with higher derivatives are small for s and p  waves but are significant in the d  waves .",
    "agreement with the experimental data is of comparable quality than in the model ignoring vector modes for the low constituent quark mass case .",
    "this conclusion has been sharpened further by studying the scalar pion radius .",
    "only for low constituent masses one can describe this quantity within the hartree approximation of the ( extended ) njl model @xcite .",
