    "figure  [ fig : lift ] explains the lift .     of @xmath450 into @xmath817 . ]",
    "we choose a path @xmath851 from @xmath480 to @xmath450 and follow it by the straight line from @xmath450 to @xmath852 .",
    "call @xmath853 this path from @xmath480 to @xmath852 .",
    "then @xmath854 is a lift of the coordinate neighborhood to a neighborhood about @xmath851 .",
    "the connection @xmath6-form on @xmath846 is @xmath174 on @xmath855 and so is @xmath189 on @xmath856 .",
    "now @xmath857 .",
    "hence the @xmath6-form on @xmath0 is @xmath858 in the trivialization we used . with our choices",
    "the @xmath290 part of the connection is @xmath859 , which we denote by @xmath304 in section  [ sec - diff ] .",

    "when we trivialize @xmath821 as above , @xmath861 becomes @xmath862 .",
    "another trivialization would transform @xmath124 by @xmath863 so that if we choose a metric on @xmath0 and choose @xmath299 as the harmonic forms of type @xmath290 , then @xmath124 is determined up to translation by @xmath300 as expected . the identification @xmath860 with @xmath864 works for each @xmath469 on at most a fundamental domain in @xmath300 .    with any trivialization @xmath865 ,",
    "the connection @xmath6-form @xmath831 becomes a @xmath6-form @xmath91 on @xmath0 which is closed because the curvature is @xmath174 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath866 so that @xmath91 is determined as a closed @xmath6-form up to integral @xmath6-cocycles .",
    "since we have not specified the trivialization , @xmath91 is determined only up to a gauge transformation , i.e. , as an element of @xmath867 .",
    "we could choose @xmath868 with @xmath304 the harmonic representative in @xmath299 .",
    "choosing another representative in the coset @xmath869 amount to choosing another trivialization of @xmath821 . in any case , @xmath861 becomes @xmath870 .",
    "we conclude this appendix with the following theorem about the operator @xmath871 .",
    "let @xmath872 be a character and let @xmath304 be the associated flat connection . if @xmath873 then @xmath874 . if @xmath875 then @xmath876 .",
    "proof : since @xmath877 we have @xmath878 .",
    "now the index of @xmath879 equals @xmath880 . to complete the proof of the theorem we need only show that @xmath881 .",
    "but @xmath882 and we have shown that @xmath883 is @xmath884 , for some character @xmath469 .",
    "now @xmath885 because @xmath886 is flat .",
    "so any holomorphic section of @xmath886 has no zeroes .",
    "thus a nonvanishing holomorphic section of @xmath886 would give a holomorphic isomorphism with @xmath887 which is not possible if @xmath888 .",
    "hence @xmath889 .",
    "we now compute @xmath729 of @xmath802 and show that the space of holomorphic sections is one dimensional .        _",
    "proof : _ the chern character of the index bundle over @xmath310 is @xmath892 where @xmath893 is the vector bundle over @xmath894 which is @xmath895 and is independent of @xmath310 .",
    "its todd class is @xmath896 .",
    "following convention we define @xmath897 .",
    "further @xmath898 .",
    "since the first chern class of the family is given by the @xmath47-form term in ( [ ch - l ] ) , we want the @xmath899-form in the integrand which is of total degree  @xmath47 in the @xmath0 direction . if we write @xmath900 as @xmath901 , the decomposition of @xmath900 along @xmath0 , @xmath902 and @xmath310 respectively , we find the desired @xmath899-form to be @xmath903 . since @xmath821 is flat , @xmath904 ; so @xmath905    we now compute @xmath906 and show that @xmath907 .",
    "we do so using the fact that @xmath908 where @xmath909 is a local holomorphic section of @xmath340 and @xmath910 is the norm for the hermitian metric on @xmath340 .",
    "let @xmath911 be a neighborhood of @xmath912 , and let @xmath913 be a coordinate neighborhood of @xmath914 . because @xmath299 covers @xmath310 , we can identify @xmath913 with a neighborhood of the appropriate @xmath915 .",
    "in fact we can take @xmath916 where @xmath917 is a neighborhood of the origin in @xmath299 .",
    "fix a path @xmath918 from @xmath480 to @xmath450 .",
    "if @xmath919 , let @xmath853 be the path from @xmath480 to @xmath852 which is @xmath918 followed by the straight line from @xmath450 to @xmath852 ( see figure  [ fig : lift ] ) . for @xmath920 let @xmath921",
    ". for each @xmath922",
    ", @xmath909 is actually a function on the lift of @xmath911 to @xmath817 ; it transforms correctly under @xmath737 to give a local section of @xmath923 .",
    "we leave the reader to check that @xmath909 is a holomorphic section of @xmath340 over @xmath924 .    now @xmath925 and @xmath926 of this expression is @xmath927 .",
    "hence @xmath928 and @xmath929 . since @xmath930 is ( real ) linear in @xmath124 , @xmath931 for @xmath932 .",
    "hence @xmath933 while @xmath934 furthermore linearity implies @xmath935 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath907 and @xmath936 and @xmath937 .",
    "hence for @xmath938 .",
    "@xmath939 is the @xmath6-form on @xmath0 equal to @xmath940 and the two form @xmath941 on @xmath310 evaluated at @xmath942 , @xmath943 equals @xmath944 finally we recall that the metric on @xmath310 is given by the inner product on @xmath299 : @xmath945 thus @xmath946 .",
    "moreover , @xmath947 with @xmath124 the basic khler form on @xmath310 .",
    "hence the first chern class @xmath948 of the determinant line bundle for @xmath949 equals @xmath124 .",
