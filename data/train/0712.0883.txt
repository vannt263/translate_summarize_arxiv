    "a number of papers  @xcite have used chemical adsorption models to analyse data from two well - known affymetrix latin - square spike - in experiments  @xcite , known as the u95 and u133 datasets .",
    "the immediate aim of these papers has been to study the physical processes responsible for converting concentrations of specific target rna in prepared solutions hybridised onto microarrays to measured fluorescence intensities .",
    "their ultimate aim has been to provide biologists with a practical algorithm for estimating absolute specific target concentrations in the presence of a complex non - specific background from fluorescence intensity data .",
    "even though there are a number of existing algorithms ( or `` expression measures '' ) of varying degees of statistical sophistication currently available to and widely used by biologists , such algorithms pay little attention to the detailed physics and chemistry of hybridisation at the microarray surface . as a result",
    "they are prone to underestimating fold changes at high target concentrations because saturation effects are not modelled , and at low target concentrations because of a failure to account adequately for non - specific hybridisation  @xcite .",
    "furthemore , the measures reported are not target concentrations as such , but surrogates derived directly from fluorescence intensities . at best , they could be described as an unknown increasing function of specific target concentrations , modulo statistical noise .    before a reliable algorithm for inferring target concentrations",
    "can be developed , an accurate model of the physics and chemistry of the process is needed .",
    "in a recent review of chemical adsorption effects at the microarray surface  @xcite , binder has described in detail a number of processes influencing fluorescence intensity measurements , including bulk dimerisation of target molecules in solution , non - specific hybridisation and probe folding at the microarray surface , and partial zippering of duplexes .",
    "analyses of the affymetrix spike - in data have provided strong evidence that these effects can not be ignored .",
    "for instance , binder and preibisch  @xcite have isolated the effects of specific and non - specific binding , carlon and heim@xcite and heim et al .",
    "@xcite have stressed the importance of bulk hybridisation and target folding in solution , and by analysing other data sets , matveeva et al.@xcite have produced evidence for the importance of probe folding .",
    "more recently , analyses of the u95 dataset  @xcite and subsequent experimental evidence  @xcite have demonstrated the significant influence of the post - hybridisation washing step in determining fluorescence intensities .",
    "although the washing step has an important scaling effect over the whole range of target concentrations , it is particularly noticeable as a probe sequence dependent scaling of the asymptote of the measured intensity isotherm at saturation concentrations .",
    "because adsorption theories of the hybridisation step which neglect the post - hybridisation washing predict a common asymptote for these isotherms , many adsorption - model - based analyses of the affymetrix latin square data sets have forced the data to fit a common asymptote  @xcite , in spite of strong statistical evidence to the contrary  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reanalyse both the u95 and u133 datasets , and a third dataset which is analogous to the u95 dataset , but without the complex background .",
    "our analysis uses a chemical adsorption model which includes a number of chemical reactions occurring during the hybridisation and post - hybridisation washing steps .",
    "details of the datasets are summarised in section  [ sec : datasets ] , and all three datasets are shown to be consistent with the empirical observations previously observed for the u95 dataset , namely that measured fluorescence intensities follow a hyperbolic isotherm with probe - sequence dependent parameters  @xcite .",
    "our physico - chemical model is described in section  [ sec : model ] and demonstrated to be quantitatively consistent with these observations in section  [ sec : qualitative ] . a quantitative analysis of how well the model fits the three datasets",
    "is given in section  [ sec : quantitative ] .",
    "an analysis in section  [ sec : prediction ] gives some indication of how intensity measurements over a whole microarray might be used to infer some of the isotherm parameters for each feature on the microarray , which in turn has the potential to contribute towards development of a practical algorithm for estimating target concentrations .",
    "concluding comments are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "three datasets are analysed in this paper , the two publicly available affymetrix latin - square spike - in experiments  @xcite , known as the u95 and u133 datasets , and a version of the u95 dataset without the complex human pancreas background , kindly made available to us by affymetrix",
    ". we will refer to these datasets as numbers i , ii and iii respectively .    in the manufacture of affymetrix genechip  arrays , single strand dna probes , 25 bases in length",
    "are synthesized base by base onto a quartz substrate using a photolithographic process .",
    "they are attached to the substrate via short covalently bonded linker molecules roughly 10 nanometres apart .",
    "a microarray chip surface is divided into some hundreds of thousands of regions called features , commonly 11 to 20 microns square , and with the single strand dna probes within each feature being synthesized to a specific nucleotide sequence .",
    "the main step in the laboratory process of gene detection with microarrays is the hybridization of crna target molecules , fractionated to lengths of typically 50 to 200 bases and with biotin labels attached to their u and c bases , onto the single strand dna probes .",
    "the hybridisation is performed at @xmath0c for 16 hours .",
    "the microarray is then washed to remove excess crna target , the biotin labels stained with fluorescent dye , and the density of hybridized probe - target duplexes in each feature detected via intensity measurements of the fluorescent dye .",
    "each gene or est is represented by a set of pairs of features ( 16 pairs in the case of the u95 dataset and 11 pairs for u133 ) using sequences of length 25 selected for their predicted hybridization properties and specificity to the target gene .",
    "the first element of the pair , termed the perfect match ( pm ) , is designed to be an exact match to the target sequence , while the second element , the mismatch ( mm ) , is identical except for the middle ( 13th ) base being replaced by its complement .    in the affymetrix spike - in experiments ,",
    "rna transcripts were spiked in at cyclic permutations of a set of known concentrations together with a complex background of crna extracted from human pancreas ( dataset i ) , human adenocarcinoma cell line ( dataset ii ) , or no background ( dataset iii ) .",

    "dataset ii also contains data from a further 4 bacterial gene probe sets each containing 20 probe pairs , which we do not include in the current analysis .    in a previous paper  @xcite it",
    "was demonstrated that the dataset i is consistent with the empirical observation that the measured fluorescence intensities @xmath1 at spike - in concentration @xmath2 are sampled from a gamma distribution with constant coefficient of variation about a mean given by a hyperbolic response curves of the form @xmath3 importantly , it was further shown using a thorough statistical analysis that each of the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is feature ( i.e. probe - sequence ) dependent , and that the asymptote , @xmath7 , is almost invariably lower for the mm feature than the neighbouring perfect - match pm feature within any pm / mm pair .",
    "on the assumption that by far the greatest proportion of the intensity signal across a whole microarray in either dataset i or ii comes from the complex background , we have preprocessed the data by carrying out a quantile normalisation across each of these two datasets  @xcite .",
    "thus all microarrays within a particular dataset have a common distribution of fluorescence intensities after preprocessing . because of the absence of a complex background , we have not carried out this step for dataset iii .",
