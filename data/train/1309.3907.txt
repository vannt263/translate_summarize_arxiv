    "sufficiently large there exists a third critical angular frequency value @xmath99 at which the total energy per unit charge is larger than the one of a single baby skyrmion and the breakup into charge-1 baby skyrmions is energetically favorable .",
    "this pattern of critical behaviour has been unobserved in previous work @xcite on isospinning charge-1 and -2 baby skyrme solitons ; mainly because the authors did not take into account deformations which break the rotational symmetry and only investigated relatively low mass values .",
    "our numerical calculations clearly show that stable , rotationally symmetric skyme solitons with mass parameter @xmath119 for angular frequencies @xmath55 are simply an artefact of the hedgehog approximation . even for lower mass values ( @xmath120 )",
    "we find that the hedgehog ansatz can be a very poor approximation ; the charge-2 baby skyrmion solution can spontaneously break its rotational symmetry when isospinning .",
    "further , we observe that for the conventional mass parameter choice ( @xmath65 ) the symmetries of the static , nonspinning soliton solutions are not significantly modified when isospin is added .",
    "this is in contrast to recent results on internally rotating soliton solutions @xcite in the 3d skyrme - faddeev model , where it was found that the model allows for transmutations , formation of new solution types and a rearrangement of the spectrum of minimal - energy solitons in a given topological sector when isospin is added .",
    "however , although the soliton s geometrical shape is largely independent of the rotation frequency @xmath4 , the soliton s size increases monotonically with increasing @xmath4 . in general , the rigid - body formula predicts for the solutions considered here total energies which for large angular momenta are roughly @xmath121 larger than those obtained for the deformed , isospinning solutions .",
    "naturally , the accuracy of the rigid rotator approximation improves with increasing soliton mass and topological charge @xmath3 .",

    "we observe , for isospinning soliton solutions in the conventional baby skyrme model , the same pattern of critical behaviour ( see figs .  1 and 2 in @xcite ) and our results can be seen as complementary .",
    "differences are the investigated mass range @xmath2 and the choice of initial conditions : whereas we relax the absolute minima ( especially nonrotationally symmetric configurations for @xmath125 ) at @xmath58 to find solutions for nonzero angular frequencies @xmath4 , the authors in @xcite choose rotationally invariant anstze as their starting configurations .",
