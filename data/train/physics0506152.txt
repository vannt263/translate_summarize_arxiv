    "the chemical potential is a central quantity underpinning many physical and chemical processes , such as phase equilibria , osmosis , thermodynamic stability , binging affinity and so on @xcite .",

    "while @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be evaluated from averages over mechanical properties of molecules ( forces , velocities and positions ) , the chemical potential is a thermal average and therefore it requires sampling the phase space of the system . indeed ,",
    "computing the chemical potential is a special case of the more general problem of computing a free - energy difference @xmath2 between two states ( labelled as 0 and 1 ) , a problem for which the inherent difficulty is well understood @xcite .",
    "free energy perturbation ( fep ) is an important category of methods for free energy calculation ; we refer to the recent works by lu _",
    "_ @xcite and by shirts and pande @xcite for review and comparisons . as explained by lu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the general working equation for fep methods can be cast as @xmath3=\\frac { \\langle w(u ) \\exp[-\\beta u/2]\\rangle_0 } { \\langle w(u ) \\exp[-\\beta u/2]\\rangle_1},\\ ] ] with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the energy difference between both systems ; @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the angular brackets denote ensemble averages performed on the system labelled by the subscript `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' .",
    "the weighting function @xmath7 is arbitrary and differs for each method introduced in the literature .",
    "the chemical potential is the free energy difference between two thermodynamic states differing by the presence of a single molecule .",
    "in other words , the chemical potential is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the helmholtz free energy of the system which depends on the number of molecules n , the volume @xmath12 and temperature of the system . in order to express the averages of eq .",
    "( [ freedif ] ) in terms of one - dimensional integrals of the energy difference @xmath13 one can then introduce the following distribution functions @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dirac delta function . in eq .",

    "@xcite , multiple staging provides much better efficiency . the efficiency is generally defined as the reciprocal of the product of the variance of the estimator multiplied by its cost @xmath27 ( that is , the total number of energy evaluations performed by the algorithm ) @xmath28)^{-1}.\\label{efficiency}\\ ] ] bennett @xcite showed that the variance of eq .",

    "the value of @xmath31 providing the minimum variance and maximum overlap is @xmath33 and to evaluate @xmath34 using the optimum @xmath35 one requires to use a self - consistent procedure , iterating the value of @xmath31 in eq .",

    ", this step only requires a small number of iterations .",
    "recent publications @xcite demonstrate that the bennett method remains the best general method to compute the chemical potential for many applications .",
    "note that the bennett method is a two - stage fep and therefore it also requires sampling of the system `` 1 '' . in the case of the determination of the chemical potential this system has n+1 molecules and @xmath20",
    "is obtained from its single - molecule energy distribution .",
    "however this extra requirement is not really a drawback .",
    "@xcite showed that , provided @xmath37 , the @xmath38average can be evaluated in the same simulation as is used to sample the @xmath23 distribution ( system `` 0 '' ) without any noticeable loss in accuracy .",
    "the @xmath24 distribution ( constructed from the energy of the real particles ) is thus a byproduct of the simulation so the average @xmath39 does not demand any extra computational cost .",
    "another group of methods for determination of the chemical potential are based on _ biased _ instead of uniform sampling . in particular ,",
    "cavity - biased methods first select spherical cavities of minimum radius @xmath40 ( a free parameter ) in which to insert the test - molecule .",
    "this accelerates the evaluation of the ensemble average in dense phases because the low - energy configurations of the test - molecule ( with large boltzmann factors ) are usually located in larger cavities with less steric hindrance .",
    "variations of this method have been proposed by several authors ; these include the cavity insertion widom method ( ciw ) due to mezei and coworkers @xcite , the excluded volume map sampling by deitrick _",
    "_ @xcite and the method proposed by pohorille and wilson @xcite .",
    "the cavities are located by a grid search over the whole simulation cell .",
    "a cavity centre is assigned at each grid point whose distance to the closest particle is greater than @xmath40 . in order to correct the bias introduced in sampling only inside the cavities one also has to calculate the probability of finding a cavity , which is obtained in the same grid - search step .",
    "a drawback of the cavity - biased method is that it is only indirectly related to the test - particle energy via the excluded volume .",
    "this fact introduces a certain inaccuracy in the estimation of the chemical potential , as it can depend on the value of the cavity radius @xmath40 selected .",
    "for instance , the ciw has recently been used to calculate the chemical potential of several species across a lipid bilayer @xcite . as a test calculation the authors estimated the chemical potential of water in water and reported variations of about 1 kcal / mol as @xmath40 was varied from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "also , using @xmath43 \\aa$ ] resulted in uncertainties of about 2 kcal / mol in estimates of the excess chemical potential of some species across the lipid layer .",
    "note that the important region of the cavity - biased method is constructed over the translational degrees of freedom of a `` coarse - grained '' spherical molecule with an effective radius .",
    "this means that it can only be applied to small solutes with spherical or roughly spherical shapes @xcite .    in this work we present an energy - biased method for the estimation of the chemical potential and reconstruction of the energy distribution @xmath19 in dense phases",
    "the idea is to restrict the sample to an important region defined by the set of bounded domains in the configurational space of the test - molecule where the energy @xmath13 is smaller than a given free parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we denote as an _ energy - well _ each compact subdomain within the test - molecule energy - landscape for which @xmath45 .",
    "note that the present approach retains the main benefit of the cavity - biased method , but provides an exact evaluation of the energy distribution @xmath19 and the chemical potential , because the energy - wells are defined directly in terms of the energy landscape .",
    "moreover our energy - biased method does not assume any particular molecular shape and therefore it may be used for non - spherical molecules and can coherently sample over rotational degrees of freedom as well .",
    "we also note that the number of stages are not limited to two . when systems 0 and 1 are very different it may be impossible within the simulation time to sample the importance region of the two systems . in this case",
    "it is more efficient to compute the total free energy difference by using a set of intermediate states .",
    "the energy bias method can be applied on each of these intermediate state transitions at the cost of performing independent simulations for each state .",
    "other approaches include , for instance , slow and fast growth methods where the system is changed from one state to another within a certain simulation time @xmath46 ( large for slow growth ) .",
    "the fast growth method consists of sampling rapid transformation from many simulations which are then combined by using jarzynski nonequilibrium work relation @xcite to obtain the total free energy difference .",

    "as stated in the introduction , energy - biased sampling consists of uniform sampling of the importance region defined by the set of subdomains in the test - molecule configurational space where its potential energy is less than @xmath47 .",
    "the probability density is therefore given by @xmath48 where the normalisation factor @xmath49 is the cumulative probability of the unbiased distribution @xmath19 and @xmath44 is an arbitrary energy ( free parameter ) .",

    "the simplest procedure for locating energy wells in step ( 1 ) is to perform a random search over the whole configurational space until a fixed number of cavities is found .",
    "this procedure , however , does not avoid the probability of exploring the same well more than once , and we observed that it can easily lead to highly correlated data . instead we perform step ( 1 ) by choosing points on a grid within the whole configurational space of the test - molecule . in the case of the lennard - jones fluid , the three - dimensional configurational space is probed at the nodes of a cartesian grid of size @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of nodes along the coordinate @xmath71 .",

    "we ensure that we are sampling different cavities for each explored configuration ( snapshot ) of the system .",

    "the search requires an average of @xmath73 energy evaluations to locate one well ( i.e. one configuration with energy @xmath45 . ) during this same step ( 1 ) one can calculate the cumulative probability @xmath74 from the estimator @xmath75 , with @xmath76 being the total number of samples ( bernoulli trials ) and @xmath77 the number of successful trials with @xmath45 , i.e. , the total number of energy - wells found .",
