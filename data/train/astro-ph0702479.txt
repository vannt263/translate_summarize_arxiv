    "the presence and origin of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) at the centre of globular clusters , are still being debated inside the astrophysical community .",
    "there are essentially two main formation theories : they could be population iii stellar remnants ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or could form in a runaway merging of young stars in sufficiently dense clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the imbhs existence is suggested primarily by an argument of plausibility : they would fill the ` embarrassing ' gap between stellar black holes ( bhs ; with mass @xmath10 ) and super - massive bhs that are believed to reside in the nucleus of most galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) . by exploiting the accurate kinematical measurements of gas and stars in nearby galaxies , important correlations between the mass of super - massive bhs and various global properties of their hosting galaxy",
    "have been deduced for instance , extrapolating the @xcite relation ",
    "@xmath11 times the mass of the host system  to globular clusters , these would contain bhs with an intermediate mass @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "indirect observational evidences come from the detection of ultra - luminous x - ray sources radiating at super - eddington luminosity ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 ) and thought to originate from matter infall on bhs considerably more massive than stellar bhs .    in globular clusters",
    ", however , direct kinematic observations are seriously obstacled by crowding and by the relatively small number of stars inside the bh gravitational influence region ( hereafter bhir ) , which can not be well resolved in many cases .",
    "thus , so far , only very few clusters have been the object of accurate kinematic studies so as to infer about the possible presence of massive objects in the central regions .",
    "we just remind the cases of the core - collapsed clusters m15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and 47 tuc , in which such a presence is not confirmed yet by the latest observational data ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) , and the highly concentrated and massive cluster g1 ( in m31 ) , where a central @xmath16 imbh has been claimed to reside @xcite , while a recent deep photometric analysis of the core region of @xmath17 cen seems to be consistent with an imbh with mass @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that for both m15 and g1 , direct and accurate @xmath19-body simulations reproduce the observed mass - to - light ratio without the need of an imbh @xcite , other , less direct , insights can be gained from the time behaviour of the period of millisecond pulsars sited in clusters central region , which permits to deduce the local acceleration .",
    "this occurs in the intriguing case of ngc 6752 where there are indications of the existence of an underluminous and compact component with mass @xmath20 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above - mentioned individual studies concerned globular clusters that are supposed to host imbh because of their ( present ) high central density and ( presently ) high rate of stellar collisions in their compact cores .",
    "nevertheless , present conditions may be drastically different from those at the early epochs of clusters life .",
    "more importantly , as firstly argued by @xcite , their dynamical status could be even inconsistent with the long - term effects that a imbh actually produces on the cluster internal evolution . using collisional @xmath19-body simulations",
    ", @xcite found that the high stellar density in the vicinity of the central imbh enhances the rate of close encounters that , in turn , induces a rapid expansion of the central region , giving rise to a medium - concentration , king - like profile , whose features are almost independent of the bh mass .",
    "they argued that an observable fingerprint of the imbh presence is just a slight slope of the density in the core region , thus suggesting as probable candidate clusters hosting imbh , those having a surface brightness logarithmic slope @xmath21 in the core ( while the typical projected profile of core - collapsed systems goes like @xmath22 ) .",
    "similar conclusions have been recently reached by @xcite who conducted direct @xmath19-body experiments of clusters with imbhs and realistic fractions of primordial binaries : the expansion of the core is further enhanced and the formation of the density cusp is confined in the immediate vicinity of the bh .",
    "this leads to density profiles with a core to half - mass radius ratio significantly higher than when the imbh is absent @xcite .",
    "all these studies are telling us that a imbh represents a ` heat ' source in the central region , acting in a way similar to hardening binaries in contrasting gravothermal collapse ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , besides these global morphological hints , other fingerprints of the imbh presence could be revealed .",
    "as known , one of the most important effect of the gravitational influence of the imbh on the surrounding stars , is the tidal erosion and disruption they undergo during close passages ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "besides complete disaggregation , this may lead to a loss of envelope mass of passing - by giants .",
    "the mass loss from stellar outer layers is also one of the possible explanation for the not yet ascertained origin of ` blue subdwarfs '  also called extreme horizontal branch stars , see @xcite and , for a review on this subject in the context of dense galactic nuclei , also @xcite , section 3.4 .",
    "these are stars heavier and bluer than turn - off stars , and they are located at the lower - left end of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , in the region of the color - magnitude diagram referred to as extreme hb ( hereafter ehb ; see the discussion in @xcite , sect .",
    "9.7 , and the recent review in @xcite ) .",
    "given the cuspy behaviour of the stellar density in the bhir and the relatively high ratio between @xmath1 and the single stellar mass , it is reasonable to expect that the above - mentioned mechanism of blue subdwarfs formation is significantly enhanced by the presence of the imbh .",
    "thus , the possibility to find some connection between this presence and that of an abundant population of ehb stars naturally emerges and , to our knowledge , has never been explored so far .",
    "this is one of the aim of the present paper .    while the direct investigation of the dynamical evolution of a cluster harbouring a massive compact object is still at the beginning  because of the recent development of sufficiently advanced computational tools  the study of the stellar phase - space distribution function ( df ) around a massive bh in the quasi - steady regime is a classical subject in stellar dynamics tackled by several authors since the early 70s @xcite . if a time much longer than the cluster relaxation time is passed since the bh formation and accretion , dynamical and ` thermal ' equilibrium can take place and a maxwellian df @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the total energy and @xmath25 a velocity parameter , should be established .",
    "nevertheless , close enough to the compact object , stars are either disrupted , because of the strong tidal interaction , or swallowed by the bh , thus generating an outward flux of positive energy that , in stationary conditions , must be constant and uniform through the central region .",
    "this precludes the maxwellian distribution being valid in the bh vicinity .",
    "simple scaling arguments @xcite or treatments based on the ` heat - transfer ' equation @xcite show , indeed , that a realistic space density behaviour is @xmath26 .",
    "such a power - law density ( or ` cusp ' ) corresponds to a df @xmath27 , as was first found , through approximate solutions of the fokker - planck equation , by @xcite and more recently confirmed with the help of more accurate methods including relaxation effects , such as : monte - carlo codes @xcite , gas - dynamical methods @xcite and direct @xmath19-body simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".    however , equilibrium self - consistent models of stellar systems including massive bhs are not so numerous .",
    "we just mention the @xcite paper on m15 employing spherical non - parametric models and the papers by @xcite and @xcite , in which axisymmetric models of , respectively , m15 and @xmath17 cen are generated to infer the radial behaviour of the @xmath28 ratio , by means of a generalization of the @xcite orbit superposition method .",
    "a further generalization of this technique has been also recently presented in @xcite to model triaxial galaxies with dark matter and a central density cusp .",
    "it is worth noting , finally , that @xcite , in order to derive hints about the presence of an imbh in 47 tuc , applied a single - mass and isotropic king model , even if in a not fully self - consistent way .    in the present study ,",
    "a self - consistent parametric model is constructed and used to estimate the mass of possible imbhs in clusters and their influence on the cluster density profile , as well as on the presence of ehb stars .",
    "it basically consists of a multimass king model appropriately extended to incorporate the df inside the bhir .",
    "the model is spherical , isotropic ( in the present version ) and relatively easy to construct and use .",
    "its multimass nature makes straightforward the inclusion of central energy equipartition , which is suggested to play a non - negligible role in the presence of a massive bh , too ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the model will be described in section [ descr ] , while in section [ profiles ] the observable features of the generated surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles will be illustrated , also with respect to the debated structural properties of clusters hosting imbh . then , in section [ massest ] , the model will be employed to deduce the mass of possible imbhs from the central density profiles provided by the recent @xcite analysis of wfpc2 _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations of 38 galactic globulars ( g1 in m31 is considered as well ) . in section [ ebtconnection ] ,",
    "finally , the connection between the existence of imbhs and the presence of ehbs will be investigated .",
    "conclusions will be drawn in section [ concl ] .",
    "in the following , given the length- , velocity- and density - scale parameters , @xmath29 , @xmath25 and @xmath30 , respectively , it is convenient to deal with dimensionless quantities , namely :    radius @xmath31 ;    velocity @xmath32 ;    mean _ total _ potential @xmath33 ;    energy ( per unit mass ) @xmath34 ;    density @xmath35 ;    cluster mass in stars inside the radius @xmath36 , @xmath37 .    bh mass @xmath38 .    a suitable df can be given by generalizing the @xcite lowered maxwellian , so as to include the df below a proper ` transition ' energy , i.e. f(e)=\\ {    ll c ( -e)^1/4 , & + ( 2)^-3/2(^-e-1 ) , & + 0 , &    .",
    "[ df ] where the coefficient @xmath39 assures the @xmath40 continuity and @xmath41 is defined so to have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the model ` limiting radius ' . the ` transition ' potential @xmath44 is considered to be the potential on the surface of the sphere , with radius @xmath45 , coinciding with the bhir .",
    "the bhir can be defined as the largest sphere , centered at the bh position , in which the motion of the stars is dominated by the field generated by the compact object .",
    "this definition is coherent with the assumption of maxwellian behaviour just outside this region ( i.e. , for @xmath46 ) .",
    "then , a reasonable condition for @xmath45 is that the enclosed mass in stars is a small fraction of the bh mass , i.e. ( ) = 0.1 , [ xbh0 ] even if this forces to solve ( as we will see later ) an implicit equation that involves a mass profile that is only a - posteriori known .",
    "this condition is similar to that adopted in @xcite ; nevertheless we chose a smaller fraction ( @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 ) to ensure the validity of the power - law behaviour for @xmath49 .",
    "the usually adopted formula @xmath50 (; @xcite ) is not a - priori compatible with this bhir definition , because it gives a radius that yields typically @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , even if the bhir has to be sufficiently small for the bh gravitational field to dominate the dynamics inside , on the other hand it must be large enough to make plausible the hypothesis of isothermal distribution outside it",
    ". this latter condition would not be realistic in an environment in which the bh still exerts a strong influence on the dynamics .",
    "the df of equation  ( [ df ] ) guarantees the ` dynamical equilibrium ' of the system , in the sense that , according to the jeans theorem , it is a solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "the presence of a massive bh , assumed to be located _ at rest _ in the cluster centre , makes that the potential time - independence is preserved and thus the df of equation  ( [ df ] ) is still a valid equilibrium solution , because @xmath24 remains an integral of motion .",
    "therefore , one can proceed in the same manner as in obtaining usual king models , that is  as required by the self - consistency  just by solving , for @xmath52 , the dimensionless poisson s equation in spherical symmetry + = -(4gr^2 ^ -2 ) ( w ) ,",

    "@xmath45 itself as a bhir radius .",
    "this is found iteratively , evaluating the ` new ' radius @xmath68 through equation ( [ xbh0 ] ) with @xmath67 generated employing the previous value of @xmath45 .",
    "the process starts with an initial guessed @xmath69 and is halted when the difference between two subsequent values stays within a given tolerance      the continuum stellar mass spectrum of the real cluster can be represented by a set of @xmath70 stellar components , each one having a star mass @xmath71 , a total mass @xmath72 and a velocity parameter @xmath73 .",

    "a more rigorous treatment would require @xmath77 to explicitly depend on @xmath71 through the exponent of @xmath24 in the df inside the bhir , as a consequence of mass segregation .",
    "this dependence was quantified by @xcite and then confirmed ( at least partially ) by means of fokker - planck @xcite , @xmath19-body @xcite and monte - carlo @xcite simulations .",
    "nevertheless , the small gain in ` theoretical coherence ' might be vanified by the use of a discrete set of stellar masses instead of the real continuous mass spectrum . furthermore , the model would be complicated by the need of separate numerical quadratures in equation  ( [ dens ] ) for each mass class . for these reasons , we simplified the model construction by considering the same @xmath78 energy exponent in @xmath79 , regardless of the stellar mass .",
    "however , the energy equipartition , responsible of mass segregation , can be still reproduced at the border of the bhir by a suitable choice of @xmath80 ( see below ) .",

    "then , since the set of @xmath75 are constrained by the given set of @xmath72 , the solutions of the poisson equation are determined just by the boundary conditions ( [ boun ] ) at @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , the set of @xmath84 can be fixed by the requirement of energy equipartition in the central region . to do that ,",

    "in practice , once given @xmath25 and @xmath85 , we have _ k=^-1 ^ -1 , with @xmath86 the function defined in equation ( 8) of @xcite , and @xmath87 .",

    "let us assume that the loss of envelope mass is the dominant effect suffered by a giant during a close passage around the imbh ( ` tidal stripping ' ) , and that it becomes an ehb star because of its uncovered underlying hotter layers @xcite .",
    "let @xmath97 be the distance from the imbh below which the tidal interaction with a star ( with radius @xmath98 and mass @xmath99 ) significantly perturbs its internal structure ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "incidentally , this population could have an integrated luminosity ( @xmath113  @xmath13 l@xmath103 , mainly in the @xmath114 band ) compatible with the far - uv excess showed by some  even metal - rich  clusters ( e.g. ngc 6388 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while , on the contrary , it would be insufficient if one considered stripping events due to close encounters between _ stars _ only , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that the existence of an ehb is favoured by the presence of an imbh .    to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we rely on the classification made in the harris catalogue ( revised on february 2003 ) .",
    "this author re - analysed various set of cmd observations ( mainly those by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the intent of updating the @xcite hb type , introducing a new type ( @xmath115 ) to account for clusters having a prominent ehb .",
    "thus , clusters with the hb type @xmath115 are considered as having ehb ( they are marked in the ehb@xmath116 column of table  [ tab_noyo ] ) .",
    "then , we study the probability distribution of finding a given number , @xmath117 , of clusters with an ehb , in a set as large as our candidate clusters set .",
    "a large number of subsets made up of 6 clusters each , were extracted _ at random _ from the list .",
    "then , @xmath117 was evaluated for each subset and a frequency distribution was computed ( see the solid histogram in fig .  [ p_di_b ] ) .",
    "the result is that the probability to get _ by chance _ a set of 6 clusters with @xmath118 ( i.e. with @xmath117 equal to or greater than that in our candidate clusters subset ) is @xmath119 .",
    "this , from a statistical point of view , means that the hypothesis of the _ independence _ between the presence of an imbh and the presence of an extended hb blue tail can be rejected at a confidence level @xmath120 percent .",
    "however , the harris new hb type was assigned to clusters with an high relative proportion of blue subdwarfs population in comparison with that at the redder side of the rr lyrae region of the hb ( harris , private communication ) , whileas the determination of the presence of the ehb _",
    "regardless _ of the other hb peculiarities would be more appropriate to our purposes .",
    "the various parameters defined by @xcite to characterize the hb morphology are unsuitable as well , because their sample contains only very few clusters of the list .",
    "for these reasons , we chose considering the maximum effective temperature , @xmath121 , evaluated by @xcite for the hb stars of a clusters set that includes a significant part of the sample ( see their table  1 ) .    in this case ,",
    "an ehb was considered as present when @xmath122 ( i.e. @xmath123 @xmath124k , see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . ehb clusters classified this way",

    "the visual inspection of the @xcite cmds  which the @xcite evaluations are based on  confirms how in these clusters the ehb stars are clearly visible and reach downward a @xmath126 magnitude as faint as the turnoff point .",
    "while a fraction of the clusters with such an ehb have an harris hb type @xmath115 , further clusters can be considered as owning ehbs .",
    "if one includes these clusters too , our candidates set has @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( see fig .  [ p_di_b ] , dashed histogram ) , consequently the confidence level rises to @xmath129 percent .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the two candidate clusters ( apart from g1 ) considered not to posses an ehb , show significant peculiarities in their hb . in particular ,",
    "ngc 6388 shows an over - luminous blue hb @xcite and , similarly to what observed in m54 @xcite , a blue hb extending anomalously beyond the theoretical zero - age hb @xcite .",
    "it can be also noticed that in the sample , there are 7 non - candidate clusters that possess ehb .",
    "this suggests that there might be other mechanisms  not related to the interaction with imbhs  at work for the formation of ehb stars",
    ". however , 4 of those clusters are highly concentrated ( @xmath130 ) or core - collapsed .",
    "this confirms that , whatever the formation mechanism is , it is favoured by an high density environment @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of such an environment at the present time is not a sufficient condition for the formation of an imbh , which is closely linked to the _ initial _ central density instead .",
    "gravothermal oscillations and collapse may have changed rapidly the former dynamical state , thus erasing the link with the initial environment .",
    "all this could explain the rather weak correlation found by @xcite between @xmath121 and the collisional parameter they defined on the basis of the present dynamical conditions .",
    "furthermore , the velocity dispersion used in the definition could be not representative of the higher actual value in the inner ( not resolved ) cusp region .",
    "however , there are other alternative explanations for the presence of blue subdwarfs , which are not based upon tidal stripping ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  7.4 and references therein ) .",
    "clusters having an extended blue tail , in a subset of 6 clusters randomly chosen from the set .",
    "the solid line histogram refers only to clusters with hb type @xmath115 , while in the dashed one those having @xmath122 are also taken into account .",

    "in this paper , the multimass isotropic and spherical king model has been extended to include the @xcite distribution function in the central region , so as to account for the presence of a central intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "this self - consistent model generates surface brightness profiles that show a power - law behaviour around the centre and a core - like profile outwards .",
    "this latter is similar to a king profile with concentration @xmath2 , though slightly steeper in the core region .",
    "the following features are particularly relevant :    @xmath5 decreases monotonically with the imbh mass @xmath1 ;    imbhs with @xmath133 , with @xmath0 the cluster mass , are compatible only with non - collapsed distributions ( @xmath134 ) ;    the core surface brightness profiles exhibit a logarithmic slope @xmath3 for reasonably low imbh masses ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these features are in remarkable agreement with the results of recent collisional @xmath19-body simulations , which found that the imbh causes a quick expansion of the a cluster core because of the enhanced collisional rate of exchange of kinetic energy both between stars of different masses @xcite and between single stars and hard binaries in 3-body encounters occurring in the black hole vicinity @xcite . a grid of models",
    "is then generated to derive possible trends of the imbh mass with the morphological parameters .",
    "it is found that , in general , @xmath135 .",
    "this mass range estimate is applied to a set of 38 galactic globular clusters recently re - analysed by @xcite as well as to the case of g1 ( in m31 ) .",
    "it was found that clusters in this sample probably host an imbh , namely : ngc 2808 , ngc 6388 , m80 , m13 , m62 , m54 and among these , the m80 and m13 brightness profiles presented in @xcite show the typical appearance of the cuspy - core behaviour reproduced by the model .",
    "the scaling relations are satisfied by our candidate clusters .",
    "relation ( [ m - mbh ] ) is close to the @xmath136 law found in larger scale systems @xcite .",
    "none the less , relation ( [ v - mbh ] ) is significantly different for the analogous relation found in galaxies @xcite , but the discrepancy can be understood by noting that the scaling law between the total mass and the central velocity dispersion for galaxies is very different from that followed by globular clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties on the mass range estimates are in many cases rather large and , as a consequence , the presence of imbhs on other clusters can not be completely ruled out .",
    "they are mainly due to the uncertainties in the central observed projected velocity dispersion , and in the logarithmic slope measurements .",
    "for this reason , we plan to carry out individual studies on a representative cluster subset in the @xcite sample , to infer the imbh mass directly from the best parametric fit of their brightness profiles .",
    "nevertheless , this preliminary and ` collective ' approach , permits to achieve an intriguing result : the presence of an extreme blue horizontal branch  determined according both to the @xcite hb type index and to the maximum effective temperature of hb stars  is associated to the presence of the imbh at a statistically significant level of confidence ( @xmath137 percent ) . such a correlation is not surprising when one takes into account the high stellar density in the inner cusp region and the relatively high ratio between @xmath1 and the single stellar mass , in calculating the rate of tidal stripping event in giants - imbh close encounters .",
    "this firmly suggests that the mass of the imbh could be one of the ` hidden ' parameters that are being searched for to explain the strong variability of hb morphology in clusters with the same metallicity and similar cmds ( the so - called ` 2nd parameter ' problem ) .",
    "for instance , the presence of a central imbh imbhs should not reside in these latter .",
    "the author would like to thank e. brocato , g. raimondo , a. sills , g. piotto , f. dantona and w.e .",
    "harris for their helpful suggestions and discussion about extreme hb stars and morphology indicators .",
    "the author s acknowledgments go also to m. freitag for his valuable comments , and to the referee ( e. noyola ) for pointing out new data available on g1 and for a careful reading of the paper . finally , the author is grateful to all the staff at the osservatorio astronomico di teramo for the kind hospitality and the friendly atmosphere enjoyed during his stay .",
