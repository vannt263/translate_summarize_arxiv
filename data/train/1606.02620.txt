    "detecting and characterising periodic variations in the brightness ( and other properties ) of astrophysical sources is a cornerstone of observational astronomy .",
    "examples include the discovery of extrasolar planetary systems , using stellar pulsations to establish the cosmological distance scale , and the study of pulsars and interacting binary star systems .",
    "nearly sinusoidal modulations are usually the result of orbital motion or rotation .",
    "however , many other astrophysical sources  notably accreting sources such as interacting binary stars , young stellar objects , and active galactic nuclei ( agn )  show persistent , random ( aperiodic , stochastic , noise ) variations in their brightness driven by the complex and turbulent accretion process .",
    "see @xcite for a brief review of random time series in astronomy .",
    "the random variations in agn can be described as ` red noise '  meaning a random process with a broad power spectrum increasing smoothly in power density to low frequencies ( often with an approximately power law shape : @xmath1 , with @xmath2 ) .",

    "the discovery of short period binary black holes in quasars is of great importance to a number of research areas including accretion physics @xcite , hierarchical structure formation @xcite , and gravitational physics @xcite .    over the years",
    "there have been many reports of periodic or quasi - periodic variations from agn , spanning the range of agn types , from radio to gamma - rays , and on timescales from minutes to years .",
    "however , this field has a chequered history .",
    "many reports of periodic variations are based on very few observed cycles of the claimed period , and a failure to properly account for the random ( red noise ) variations which can produce intervals of seemingly periodic behaviour .",
    "see @xcite for a general discussion of this point , and @xcite for some specific examples of periodicity claims drawn just from x - ray observations of nearby agn @xcite , which showed @xmath9 ` cycles ' in a single , continuous x - ray observation . ] .",
    "further observations of the same targets usually fail to show the strictly repeating , coherent oscillations expected from a truly periodic process . as we enter the era of massive time - domain surveys capable of studying @xmath10 targets , it is becoming more important to carefully assess detection procedures in order to understand and control the number of false detections . in this paper",
    "we re - examine the case of pg 1302@xmath0102 , and we consider the broader problem of how different stochastic models can make it difficult to distinguish periodic modulation among light curves selected from large time - domain surveys .",
    "figure [ fig : examples ] ( top panel ) shows the eight years of crts photometric data for pg 1302@xmath0102 fitted with a sinusoidal model .",
    "the data comprise @xmath11 v - band magnitude estimates with a mean of @xmath12 mag .",
    "the data were taken with two very similar telescopes ( css and mls ; these provided @xmath13 and @xmath14 photometric points , respectively ) .",
    "the sampling pattern is irregular , comprising nine ` seasons ' each spanning @xmath15 months with gaps of @xmath16 months . within each season",
    "there are @xmath17 nights of data , each containing four closely spaced ( @xmath18 few minutes ) photometric measurements .",
    "the error bars provided by the crts pipeline processing are in this case overestimated by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "this effect can be seen by examining the short timescale variations in the data : the rms variation of the magnitude estimates within groups of nearby data ( each group spanning @xmath20 days , where intrinsic variability is expected to be weak , and only including groups with @xmath21 points ) is a factor @xmath22 smaller than the error bars .",
    "the data clearly show significant variations , with an rms @xmath23 mag .",
    "we fitted the data ( using weighted least squares ) with a model comprising a sinusoid plus a constant offset : @xmath24 ( this is equivalent to a model @xmath25 with amplitude given by @xmath26 and phase @xmath27 . )",
    "the best - fitting amplitude is @xmath28 mag and the best - fitting ( observer frame ) period is @xmath29 yr , slightly different from the @xmath30 yr found by .",
    "for fitting their sinusoidal model g15a included additional archival data  notably linear data @xcite  extending the observational baseline .",

    "examples ( b ) and ( c ) were randomly selected from the @xmath35 best candidates in runs of @xmath36 simulations of each process . ]",
    "it is also possible to fit the data using a stochastic model .",
    "however , is not meaningful to simply compare the @xmath37 values for these fits .",
    "when fitting stochastic models to individual time series , the @xmath37 fit statistic loses its simple meaning as a diagnostic of the ` goodness of fit ' .",
    "( this is because the variance of the process is itself a parameter to be fitted ; the standard @xmath37 statistic only makes sense as a likelihood proxy when the variance is fixed .",
    "in fact , @xmath38 is possible for any sufficiently flexible stochastic process .",
    "see also @xcite ) .    in order to compare a periodic model to a stochastic model ,",
    "we have performed a bayesian model comparison between the sinusoidal model and a simple stochastic process , the damped random walk model .",
    "we first computed the posterior densities for the parameters of each model using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we used a method based on the ensemble sampler proposed by @xcite with @xmath39 draws based on @xmath35 ` walkers ' after removing a ` burn - in ' period .",
    "we then computed the full marginal likelihoods ( often called ` evidence ' ) of each model using the methods described in @xcite and used by @xcite .",
    "the damped random walk ( drw ) is a stochastic process often used to describe quasar variability from survey data .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is among the very simplest continuous - time stochastic processes .",
    "the drw has an auto - covariance function @xmath40 , specified by two parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which determine the ( total ) variance and characteristic timescale , respectively .",
    "equivalently , the drw has a power spectrum ( the fourier transform of the @xmath43 ) that is flat ( power law index @xmath44 ) below @xmath45 , and smoothly bends to a power law with index @xmath46 at higher frequencies .",
    "we have fitted this model , with three parameters @xmath47 , to the mean - subtracted pg 1302@xmath0102 data .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 is a scale factor applied to the photometric error bars ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we assigned the following prior densities on these parameters .",
    "for @xmath42 and @xmath41 ( which are positive - valued ) we assigned lognormal priors , in both cases with @xmath49 ( corresponding to @xmath50 dex ) .",
    "the means of each lognormal prior were set based on the geometric mean @xmath42 of @xmath51 d from quasar samples in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and to give @xmath52 mag . for @xmath48 we assigned a uniform prior .",
    "the posterior and prior densities of these parameters are shown in figure [ fig : mcmc ] ( left ) and summarised in table [ tab ] .",
    "the posterior shows @xmath48 is low , consistent with the conclusion above ( section [ sect : obs ] ) that the error bars are a factor @xmath53 too large .",
    ".summary of prior and posterior distributions .",
    "[ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     [ tab ]    we also fitted a sine model with four parameters @xmath54 to the mean - subtracted pg 1302@xmath0102 data .",
    "the model is based on equation [ eqn : sin ] with an additional , @xmath48 , to rescale the error bars .",
    "the two amplitude parameters , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , were given zero - mean normal priors ( and @xmath57 chosen to give a prior mean @xmath58 mag ( the same mean prior variance as the drw model ) .",
    "the period @xmath59 was assigned a uniform distribution ( equivalent to using a pareto prior distribution for the frequency , @xmath60 ) .",
    "the @xmath48 parameter was given the same uniform prior as for the drw model .",
    "the posterior and prior densities of these parameters are shown in figure [ fig : mcmc ] ( right ) and table [ tab ] .",
    "we then estimated the marginal likelihood of each of these models , @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents all the parameters of model @xmath63 , @xmath64 is their combined prior density , and @xmath65 is the usual likelihood function given data @xmath66 .",
    "the ratio , @xmath67 , called the ` bayes factor ' , provides a way to weigh the probabilities of two models , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . here , the two model are the drw and sine models .",
    "marginal likelihoods are usually difficult to compute .",
    "we therefore used three methods to calculate @xmath70 draws , the laplace approximation of the posterior distribution , and the @xmath71-fold cross - validation method described in @xcite ] . using all the three methods we found @xmath72 , indicating a very strong preference for the drw over the sine model .",
    "this does not mean the drw provides an adequate description of the data , only that it is strongly favoured over the sine model .",
    "this may at first seem surprising , given the smooth nature of the light curve ( top panel of figure [ fig : examples ] ) .",
    "however , close inspection reveals that the sine model fails to capture structure in the light curve ( such as the different peak magnitudes of the two maxima ) that can be modelled by the drw .",
    "this is despite the fact that pg 1302@xmath0102 was chosen to be among the most periodic from @xmath73 light curves .",
    "in the above analysis we found the simple stochastic model to be strongly preferred over the sinusoidal model , despite the undulating appearance of the light curve of pg 1302@xmath0102 .",
    "we next study how often simple stochastic processes produce nearly sinusoidal light curves by producing a number of fake time series with the same sampling pattern as the pg 1302@xmath0102 crts + linear data but generated using    1 .   a gaussian noise process with a steep , bending power law ( bpl ) power spectrum , 2 .",
    "a damped random walk ( drw ) , 3 .   a sinusoidal process .",
    "we refer to the three types of process as the bpl , drw , and sine models , respectively .",
    "the bpl and drw are intended to simulate observations of normal ( single bh ) quasars , but with different assumptions about the typical quasar power spectrum .",
    "we initially set the drw timescale parameter @xmath74 d , the geometric mean of the quasar samples in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bpl model has a steep high frequency power spectrum .",
    "this choice of model is motived by the analysis of the high - quality _ kepler _ light curves of nearby agn which showed much steeper power spectra than the standard drw model allows @xcite , with power law indices @xmath75 .",
    "steep high - frequency power spectra are also common in rapid x - ray variability of nearby agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has the form given in section 3.5 of @xcite , with two bend frequencies , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we use power law indices of @xmath44 ( below @xmath76 ) , @xmath46 ( between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , and @xmath78 ( above @xmath77 ) .",
    "the frequencies were initially set to @xmath79 yr@xmath80 ( timescale @xmath81 yr ) and @xmath82 yr@xmath80 ( timescale @xmath83 d ) .",
    "this is based on the high quality optical power spectrum of zw 229 - 15 from _ kepler _ data @xcite with frequencies scaled down by a factor @xmath7 as expected for a @xmath84  quasar .",
    "the sine model simulations are intended to fake data as if from short - period binary quasars , with each simulation having a single modulation period randomly drawn from a uniform distribution over the range @xmath85 yr ( corresponding to a frequency distribution @xmath86 over the range @xmath87 yr@xmath80 ) .",
    "more details of the simulation procedure are given in the appendix ( section [ sect : simdets ] ) .",
    "we simulated @xmath36 time series using each of the three processes .",
    "we then fitted each with the sinusoidal model .",
    "we identified as ` periodic candidates ' all simulations for which ( a ) the fit is good ( @xmath88 ) and the improvement in the fit compared to a constant is large ( @xmath89 ) , and ( b ) the period is in the range @xmath90 yr .",
    "the first criterion is used to select data with significant variability that resembles a sinusoidal modulation ( @xmath89 is comparable to that found for pg 1302@xmath0102 above ) .",
    "the longest allowed period was chosen to match that of and who selected only periodic candidates with @xmath91 cycles in the @xmath92-year crts data .",
    "we found it necessary to impose a limit on the shortest allowed periods that is slightly longer than the typical spacing of the crts seasons . allowing shorter periods results in a large number of good fits with periods @xmath93 yr or shorter , where the quasi - periodic sampling pattern of the crts data occasionally aligns with local maxima or minima of the simulation .",
    "this is an aliasing effect also discussed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : examples ] ( b)-(c ) show examples of candidate periodicities drawn from simulations of the bpl and drw processes .    apart from our choice of the range of accepted periods , the above criteria are not intended to reproduce the period detection methods of and , or any other paper .",
    "we are simply selecting time series that have a sinusoidal shape ( those that give a good match , in a least squares sense , to a sinusoid , and a poor match to a constant model ) .",
    "any reasonable period detection algorithm should be able to identify the same time series as appearing to be periodic over at least @xmath94 cycles .",
    "a more general selection and fitting procedure that allowed for non - sinusoidal periodicities and for additional trends in the data will mostly likely identify additional false periods that were not selected by our fitting , and so our method is conservative .",
    "furthermore , we selected candidates based on fits to @xmath95 data points spanning @xmath96 yr ( appropriate for a combined crts + linear dataset )  this included more points and a longer baseline than most of the crts data used by  and so our criteria for selecting periodic variability are in this sense more strict .",
    "simulated data meeting our selection criteria were produced with a rate of @xmath97 per @xmath98 simulations for the drw and bpl processes , with parameters defined as above .",
    "the periods of the fitted sinusoids are long , most are in the range @xmath99 yr ( i.e. @xmath100 cycles over the simulated data ) , and the strongest cases have periods of @xmath101 yr , always near the lower limit of the allowed range",
    ". the distribution of periods is shown in figure [ fig : periods ] for the @xmath102 candidates identified by from the crts data , and from the @xmath35 strongest period detections in simulations of the bpl , drw , and sine processes . the steep spectrum ( red noise )",
    "random processes produce nearly - sinusoidal variations when sampled intermittently , and most of these ` phantom periodicities ' show only a few cycles , typically less than three .",
    "we have repeated the simulation experiments above with different choices for the bpl bend frequencies and the drw timescale .",
    "the rate of phantom periods is highest when @xmath103 d ( drw ) or @xmath104 yr@xmath80 ( bpl ) .",
    "the power spectra that show @xmath105 peaks ( @xmath106 for the drw model ) near the observable frequency range ( @xmath107 yr@xmath80 ) produce time series with strong , smooth variations on the timescales sampled , and are mostly likely to produce phantom periods . @xcite and @xcite found a geometric mean of @xmath108 d ( @xmath109 yr ) from their drw model fitting to large samples of quasars .",
    "this is the right order of magnitude for phantom periods to be most easily produced in data spread over @xmath110few years .",
    "if the drw spectrum is modified to have a high frequency slope of @xmath111 ( rather than @xmath112 ) , the rate of phantom periods is increased by a factor of @xmath110few , to @xmath113 in @xmath51 simulations .",
    "the reduction in the rate of phantom periods with higher / lower drw characteristic timescale can be understood as follows . if the timescale above which the power spectrum flattens to @xmath114 ( @xmath115 in the drw model , @xmath116 in the bpl model ) is shorter than the @xmath117 yr inter - season spacing of the data , phantom periods are rare . in such cases",
    "the inter - season variability is essentially white noise and this is unlikely to produce smooth undulations between seasons . on the other hand , if this timescale is considerably longer than the @xmath118 yr span of the observations , and the power spectrum remains steep far below the lowest observable frequencies ( longest timescales ) , the variations will be dominated by smooth , quasi - linear trends that get weaker as @xmath76 moves lower ( in our models the total power in the power spectrum is constant , so power moves out of the observed band as @xmath76 decreases ) .",
    "the chance of the variations being dominated by a succession of roughly equally spaced peaks ( and/or troughs ) is therefore reduced ( unless one applies ` detrending ' to the data , which then increases the rate of phantom periods ) .",
    "period candidates identified by .",
    "panels ( b)-(d ) show the frequencies of the @xmath35 best candidates from @xmath36 simulations of ( b ) red noise with bpl spectrum , ( c ) red noise with a drw spectrum , ( d ) sinusoids with uniformly distributed periods .",
    "the histograms show the density of periods , i.e. each is normalised such that its total area is unity .",
    "there is a clear tendency to find phantom periodicities with long periods ( @xmath81 yr ) while truly sinusoidal signals are most easily recovered at shorter periods ( a preference for periods of @xmath119 years is expected from sampling theory given the roughly annual spacing of the observing seasons ) . ]",
    "these simulation experiments demonstrate that when trying to detect periodic signals from a large pool of red noise time series sampled like crts data , ` phantom ' periodicities will be found , and their periods tend to be near the longest allowed period ( @xmath120 cycles over the available data , assuming obvious aliasing periods are ignored ) .",
    "this effect was previously discussed by @xcite and @xcite from large surveys of quasar light curves . by contrast , genuinely periodic variations are most easily detected with periods @xmath119 yr due to the seasonal sampling of the data .",
    "we stress that the precise number of phantom periods we find should not be directly compared to the survey of , , or of @xcite , and @xcite  our detection criteria are different , and our simulation experiment focusses on above - average data quality ( a bright , variable quasar ) .",
    "the key point is that light curves with a sinusoidal appearance are produced at a rate that is not insignificant , and this rate depends strongly on the power spectrum .",
    "our lack of knowledge ( or poor assumptions ) about the true range of power spectral shapes for normal quasars translates to uncertainty about ( or poor calibration of ) the rate of phantom periods in quasar surveys .",
    "that apparently sinusoidal time series are generated is not due to a problem with the analysis procedures , it is an intrinsic property of random processes with steep power spectra .",
    "time series from red noise processes , which span timescales over which the power spectrum is steep ( @xmath121 ) , will usually be dominated by smooth variations showing modulations occurring on timescales of order the length of the time series .",
    "intermittent time sampling and low signal / noise of the data make it easier to mistake a phantom periodicity for a real one .",
    "fundamentally they can only be distinguished by much longer time series spanning many cycles of the putative period ; truly periodic processes will continue to oscillate while red noise processes are progressively less likely to show further oscillations .",
    "( an intermediate possibility , beyond the scope of this paper , is that of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) which show drifts in period , phase or amplitude . )",
    "when searching for rare events in a very large survey of sources , it is particularly important to understand the false positive rate .",
    "once the false positive probability per source is higher than the true incidence of the event in the survey population there will ( on average ) be more false than true detections .",
    "the periodic candidate identified by , and the @xmath102 candidates identified by , were selected from @xmath122 quasars .",
    "the characteristic timescales and other properties of quasar power spectra are still only poorly understood , but are likely to depend on the mass and other properties of the agn @xcite .",
    "the quasars in any large sample spanning a range of @xmath123 and @xmath124 will likely include a range of power spectral shapes .",
    "those quasars with a high power density and steep spectra over the observed timescale range will be most likely to produce phantom periods , and a survey containing a few thousand such quasars should be expected to produce many phantom periods .",
    "used drw simulations to assess the significance of the pg 1302@xmath0102 detection .",
    "they performed two different tests , one was a simulation for each quasar in their survey , the other was an analysis of @xmath98 simulations of data like that of pg 1032@xmath0102 .",
    "the apparent significance in the latter test only demonstrates that their simulations are not good at reproducing particular properties of the data , they do not demonstrate that a period has been detected . if quasar power spectra are steeper than the drw model ( as indicated by e.g. the _ kepler _ studies cited above ) the simulation test based on drw simulations could underestimate the number of false positives . by the same argument",
    ", it is meaningless to quote  as and @xcite do  the detection significance of periodicities using periodogram statistics ( including the lomb - scargle periodogram ) that are calibrated against a white noise null hypothesis , when the alternative hypothesis is non - white noise .",
    "a small @xmath125-value in such cases simply rejects the white noise null hypothesis ( already known to be false ! ) , it does not necessarily support a periodic alternative .",
    "there are several other potential problems with the simulation test of .",
    "one is that the pg 1302@xmath0102 was selected to be among the most periodic of @xmath126 quasars , hence there is a large ` look elsewhere ' effect for the number of quasars searched .",
    "further , the wavelet method they used decomposes the data by time and frequency , increasing still more the ` look elsewhere ' effect .",
    "precise calibration of the survey - wide false positive rate would require one to simulate the entire distribution of quasars many times over , accounting for the plausible range of aperiodic power spectra for each quasar , and with sufficient statistics to determine the probability of a false positive to an accuracy of @xmath127 per object .",
    "another issue is the treatment of measurement errors in simulations .",
    "the crts photometric errors for pg 1302@xmath0102 are significantly overestimated ; simulating random measurement errors that are larger than the measurement errors of the real data ( as in @xcite ) will lead to unrealistic simulations . in this case , that means too much ` white noise ' in the simulations , which then reduces the probability of the simulations producing strong , smooth modulations .",
    "if we repeat our simulations tests adding random measurement errors with a standard deviation equal to the crts pipeline error bars , the number of phantom periodicities drops by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "( our selection procedure relies on obtaining a good fit , i.e. @xmath128 , which is much harder to achieve in the presence of increased white noise . )",
    "fortunately , in particular cases such as pg 1302@xmath0102 or pso j334.2028 + 01.4075 @xcite , the issue of stochastic or nearly - periodic variations can be resolved by further observations .",
    "if more ` cycles ' of data  ideally with a higher sampling rate and improved precision  match the extrapolation of the current sinusoidal model , that would strongly support the periodic model .",
    "the more future cycles that remain coherent with the model ( based on current data ) , the stronger the evidence for a true periodicity .",
    "if the light curve diverges from the model , and in an apparently random manner , that will be evidence against the periodic model .",
    "on the other hand a smooth and systematic period or phase drift could indicate the presence of an optical quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) , e.g. a strong resonance in the accretion flow not related to the orbit of a binary smbh .    in the short term , however , it is often more practical to ` go wide ' ( light curves from many more targets ) than to ` go deep ' ( longer , better quality time series of individual targets ) , so it is particularly important to calibrate the false positive rate of few - cycle periodicities in irregular and noisy data .",
    "if true periodicities are rare  as one might expect given than most quasars are powered by accretion onto a single bh and show stochastic variations , with only a small minority in every @xmath129 field quasars ( at @xmath130 ) may be expected to harbour a short period smbh binary system .",
    "] of spectroscopic quasars expected to be short period binary smbhs  a slight underestimate in the adopted value of the false positive rate could mean the false period detections outnumber the true detections .",
    "improving our understanding of the range of quasar noise power spectra would improve any search for outliers in samples of quasar variability .",
    "any true binary accreting black hole system likely undergoes stochastic variability in addition to periodic variations , so it is not yet clear that searches for the purely periodic signals are the best approach to finding these systems .",
    "we encourage further development of methods to identify periodic and mixed periodic / stochastic processes hidden among a range of stochastic processes , and to better identify the limitations of such methods when applied to sparsely sampled photometric data . in a preliminary investigation ( applying the bayesian analysis of section [ sect : bayes ] on sinusoidal simulations from section [",
    "sect : sims ] ) we found that even strictly sinusoidal variations were difficult to distinguish from a simple stochastic process when the number of cycles was @xmath131 , but relatively straightforward to distinguish with @xmath81 cycles .",
    "further work needs to be done to uncover the fundamental limitations of distinguishing periodic and stochastic signals , given a particular sampling strategy .    in 1978",
    ", bill press closed his article on _ flicker noises in astronomy and elsewhere _ with a note of caution about how easy it is for the eye - brain system to select ` three - cycle ' periodicities in random time series @xcite .",
    "we might note here that , as we enter the era of ` big - data ' time domain surveys , one might do well to also regard with caution few - cycle periodicities selected by machine methods when they come from large samples of noisy time series .",
    "one should not be too pessimistic , however .",
    "as our understanding of the variability of different source populations improves , we will be better able to calibrate detection procedures and realise the potential of machine learning methods for mining the large time series compendia for rare , exotic behaviour .",

    "<S> we then discuss some of the problems one encounters when searching for rare , strictly periodic signals among a large number of irregularly sampled , stochastic time series , and use simulations of quasar light curves to illustrate these points . from a few thousand simulations of steep spectrum ( ` red noise ' ) stochastic processes </S>",
