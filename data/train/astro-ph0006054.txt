    "seyfert galaxies are nearby active galaxies that have been traditionally classified into two types according to the presence or absence of broad optical / uv emission lines ( more than a couple thousand km s@xmath4 fwhm ) .",
    "however , after broad lines were discovered in the polarized spectrum of the typical seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc 1068 ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) , it became clear that broad - line region clouds can exist in seyfert 2 galaxies as well as seyfert 1s , although these clouds may be located inside ( and hidden behind ) an optically and geometrically thick disk . with the development of better instruments and techniques",
    ", spectropolarimetry has revealed the existence of polarized broad emission lines ( and hence hidden blrs ) from more than ten seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. miller & goodrich 1990 , tran , miller , & kay 1992 ) .",
    "based on these polarized seyfert 2 galaxies , a viewing - dependent unification scenario has been proposed that predicts the existence of a hidden active nucleus and broad line region in all seyfert galaxies , making seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are essentially identical .",
    "hard x - ray observations with the japanese x - ray satellite ginga revealed hidden luminous nuclei in several seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. awaki et al .",
    "1991 ) , demonstrating that hard x - ray observations are useful to reveal highly obscured nuclei . since nuclear x - rays pass though the thick matter , such galaxies are the best targets to investigate agn environments . in particular , it is crucial to reveal the origin of the weak excess emission in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. krupper , urry & canizares 1990 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the soft x - rays represent scattered light , similar to optical polarized broad lines ( netzer , turner & george 1998 ) .",
    "another possibility is that soft x - rays can come from starbursts ( e.g. , dahlem , weaver & heckman 1998 ) or agn - driven jets ( colbert et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if x - ray and optical / uv photons are scattered in the same way , there should be a relation between them . to investigate",
    "whether the soft x - ray emission in seyfert 2 galaxies is related to nuclear activity , we examine those known to have optical polarized broad emission lines .",
    "choosing objects with significant polarization maximizes the chance of detecting scattered x - rays from the agn as opposed to x - rays from the galaxy .",
    "the japanese x - ray satellite asca allows spectroscopy in the entire @xmath0 kev band , and so we can directly measure both the hard x - ray emissions from obscured nuclei and any associated soft x - ray emission . by comparing our x - ray results with those of optical spectropolarimetric observations , we can test the origin of the soft component and investigate the properties of the nuclei and scattering regions in seyfert 2 galaxies with polarized broad lines ( hereafter pbl seyfert 2 galaxies ) . the differences between the amount of polarization in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  compared to more typical seyfert 2 galaxies that have no detectable polarization , should affect their corresponding x - ray properties .",
    "we attempt to clarify this difference in our analysis .",
    "miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) and tran , miller & kay ( 1992 ) found about 10 pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "eight of these have been observed with asca .",

    "although this source is classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy at redshift of 0.307 , the x - ray characteristics are similar to that of a seyfert 1 galaxy or a qso , i.e. the spectrum is described by a single power - law model with a photon index of 1.30@xmath100.15 and an absorption column of less than 6@xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the x - ray flux is @xmath138@xmath1410@xmath15 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath12  in the @xmath1 kev band , which corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath134@xmath1410@xmath16 ergs s@xmath4 .",

    "we first analyze the two observations separately .",
    "table 1 shows the count rate in the @xmath0 kev band for each .",
    "since their count rates do not vary significantly and their hardness ratios of @xmath1 kev versus @xmath17 kev rate remain the same to within a 1 @xmath18 error , we conclude that their x - ray spectra do not change significantly between the two observations . as a result",
    ", the separate observations are added to produce one spectrum for each galaxy for analysis purposes .",
    "we combine energy bins to contain more than 40 counts in each bin and apply a @xmath19 method in the xspec package for spectral fitting .",
    "the x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies can be approximated by equation ( 1 ) , which represents a two - component continuum plus an fe k@xmath20 line ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "we apply this model , labeled model 1 , in our fitting procedure , with a power - law as the soft x - ray component to represent the contribution of scattered emission from the agn .",
    "some broadening of the fe k line is reported by turner et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , but it is unclear whether there is significant line broadening in our data .",
    "we thus assume that the fe k line is narrow for all cases .",
    "model 1 describes all sources well with a reduced @xmath211 .",
    "the fitting results are listed in table 2 , and the spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath22    @xmath23    where the soft component is a power - law in models 1 , 2 , and 3 and a raymond plasma in model 4 .    for model 1 , the observed @xmath1 kev fluxes for the hard components range from 3@xmath1410@xmath15 to 1.8@xmath1410@xmath24 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath12 , which correspond to observed luminosities ( @xmath25 ) of @xmath26 ergs s@xmath4  assuming @xmath27 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission with @xmath282 is often seen in normal galaxies ( e.g. okada 1998 ) and is thought to originate from a superposition of discrete sources ( e.g. low mass x - ray binaries and sne ; makishima et al .",
    "it is well known that the ratio of x - ray to blue band luminosities ( @xmath29 ) is about 4@xmath1410@xmath30 for normal and starburst galaxies",

    "since @xmath29 for our sample is order 10@xmath33 ( whittle et al . 1992 ) , we conclude that the hard x - ray emission is most likely to originate from nuclear activity .",
    "when applying model 1 , the photon indices of the hard component are poorly determined , ranging from @xmath34 to 2.22 .",
    "assuming the hard emission is related to the agn , we next fix the photon index of the hard component to be 1.7 ( model 2 ) , which is the canonical observed value for type 1 agns ( e.g. mushotzky 1982 ) .",
    "when the best fit value of @xmath35 is less than the galactic absorption , we set @xmath35 equal to the galactic column .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath20 line is the most important parameter to investigate the origin of the hard component ( e.g. awaki et al . 1991 and turner et al .",
    "1997b ) , and so we fix the center energy of the line at 6.4 kev ( in the rest frame ) , the energy of fe k@xmath20 fluorescence from cold matter .",
    "when fixing the hard x - ray photon indices ( model 2 ) , the values of @xmath36 increase because the overall spectra tend to be flatter than a @xmath281.7 spectrum .",
    "however , if our assumptions about the intrinsic spectral shape of the hard x - ray ( agn ) component are correct , then model 2 implies large column densities and large equivalent widths for the fe k@xmath20 line ( see table 2 ) .",

    "@xmath37 is useful to compare with results in the literature .",

    "matt et al . (",
    "1996 ) point out that , besides absorption , a flat spectrum can result from a significant compton reflection component . to test this idea , we apply a compton reflection model ( model 3 ) to the hard components of mrk 1210 , mrk 477 , was49b and ngc 7212 and find that the hard x - ray emission can be reproduced by compton reflection ( table 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath36 values are less than those for the absorbed power - law model ( models 1 and 2 ) , although iron line intensities are much weaker than predicted for reflection by reynolds et al .",

    "absorption in excess of the galactic column is not indicated for most galaxies .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for the soft components are listed in table 4 .    in order to test the origin of the soft component , we characterize it using the raymond - smith plasma model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) ( model 4 ) .",
    "we set the metal abundance free , because the thermal emission detected from starburst galaxies and ngc 1068 can be reproduced by a thin thermal plasma model with sub - solar abundances ( e.g. ueno et al .",
    "1994 for ngc 1068 , tsuru et al .",
    "1997 for m82 ) .",
    "we find the temperatures for ngc 7212 and mrk 477 to be greater than several kev , while the temperature and metal abundance for mrk 1210 and was 49b are 0.86 kev and 0.03 , and 0.72 kev and 0.02 , respectively .",

    "line - like features are apparent in the spectra of mrk 3 and mrk 477 ( table 5 ) .",
    "the detection of the line in the spectrum for mrk 3 is consistent with the result by griffiths et al .",
    "based on our spectral fits , we find hard x - ray emission associated with nuclear activities in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .",

    "we conclude that obscured nuclei are common in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .    using @xmath37",
    ", we can examine whether the estimated number of photons are sufficient to ionize the surrounding region .",
    "for seyfert 1 galaxies , the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath1 kev band ( @xmath40 ) is well correlated with the broad @xmath41 luminosity ( @xmath42 ) , with a ratio of @xmath40/@xmath43 @xmath44 ( e.g. blumenthal , keel , & miller 1982 ) .",

    "the discrepancy is similar for other indicators of nuclear activity ; @xmath37/@xmath47 for pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  are only 1/10 that of seyfert 1 galaxies ( figure 3a)/@xmath48 - 0.5 ) , which indicates that the dominant energy source of ir emission is agn activity . ] , and bassani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) point out a small ratio of @xmath37 to the luminosity of [ oiii ] .",
    "we conclude that correcting only for hard x - ray absorption results in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  having @xmath37 that is 10 times less than predicted if they harbor a seyfert 1 nucleus .      if models 1 or 2 do not represent the actual spectral form of the nuclear source , @xmath37 does not represent the true luminosity .",
    "we found that the x - ray spectra for some pbl seyfert 2s are well represented with the compton reflection models , although their iron emission lines are weaker than that for a pure reflection model ( e.g. matt et al . 1996 ) . since most of the iron emission in this scenario is attributed to the reflection component , the contribution of reflection to the hard component can be estimated from a ratio of the measured to predicted iron line intensities . assuming the equivalent width of 1.5 kev for a pure reflection component , the contribution is estimated to be @xmath49 . from theoretical considerations , the upper limit to the efficiency of the compton mirror in the 210 kev band is about @xmath50 for @xmath51 = 1.0 .",
    "if we assume an efficiency of 5@xmath6 , the true x - ray luminosity ( @xmath52 ) is described as    @xmath53    where ew and eff@xmath54 are the observed equivalent width of iron k@xmath20 line and the efficiency of the compton mirror in the 210 kev band respectively .",
    "figure 3b shows a plot of @xmath52 versus @xmath55 .",
    "pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  have the same ratio of @xmath56 as seyfert 1s .",
    "therefore , by accounting for the observed spectrum as reflected rather than absorbed emission , the intrinsic source would be ten times more luminous and pbl seyfert 2 galaxies   would be consistent with having powerful agn activity .",
    "tran 1995b pointed out the existence of strong nuclear activities in ngc 7212 and mrk 463e from the line ratio diagnostic of jet regions .",
    "the powerful activities inferred from the x - ray data after the correction of reflection efficiency are consistent with his claim .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies with x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath3 ergs s@xmath4  have variability time scales of 10000 seconds .",
    "if pbl seyfert 2 galaxies   possess obscured seyfert 1 type nuclei but we are seeing their hard x - ray emission directly , similar time variability is expected .",
    "however , mrk 1210 , mrk 477 and ngc 7212 show no significant time variability in periods of one month , one day and one week , respectively .",
    "this probably indicates that these galaxies do not have small variability time scale such as seyfert 1 galaxies , although we need more x - ray monitors in order to achieve the conclusion .",
    "mrk 3 has been monitored with the einstein , ginga , bbxrt , rosat and asca x - ray missions .",
    "figure 4 shows light curves in the soft and hard bands .",
    "as marshall et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) mentioned , the hard x - ray flux gradually decreases between the ginga and asca observations .",
    "the variability time scale is about 1 yr , which is similar to that of luminous qsos .",
    "a lack of short timescale spectral variability for pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  can be explained by more massive black holes with smaller accretion rates and/or the dominance of the compton reflection process for energies approaching 10 kev .",
    "the latter indicates more powerful x - ray activity , and so both possibilities suggest the existence of more massive black holes than those of seyfert 1 galaxies with the same apparent x - ray luminosity .",
    "this result is consistent with arguments by nishiura & taniguchi ( 1998 ) , who deduced large central black hole masses from analysis of line widths of polarized broad lines .",
    "we detect distinct soft x - ray components with x - ray luminosities in the @xmath17 kev band of about 10@xmath57 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "no associated strong absorption indicates that the x - rays originate outside the thick matter that absorbs the hard x - rays .",
    "the soft x - rays can be associated with circumnuclear starburst activities which are often seen in seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. maiolino & rieke 1995 ) . on the other hand , optical scattered light",
    "is observed by spectropolarimetry . from the analogy of these observations",
    ", it is naturally suggested that x - rays from nuclei are also scattered into our line of sight .",
    "we examine possibilities for the origin of the soft component using 1 ) the x - ray spectrum , 2 ) the correlation between lx and @xmath55 , and 3 ) the correlation between lx and luminosities of scattered @xmath41 lines .",

    "ngc 7212 , mrk 477 , mrk 3 , and mrk 348 have flat spectra represented by a power - law model with a photon index @xmath58 2.3 .",
    "this result , combined with little soft x - ray absorption , suggests that thermal emission due to starburst activity is not dominant in the soft x - ray band .",
    "in addition , we detect a line - like feature around 0.9 kev for mrk 3 and mrk 477 , which is one characteristic of a scattered light in a highly ionized plasma region ( netzer 1995 , griffiths et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , mrk 1210 and was 49b have softer spectra than those of the other targets .",
    "their soft components can be described as thin thermal emission with low metal abundances of @xmath580.1 and @xmath580.14 having @xmath590.86 kev and @xmath590.72 kev , respectively . for mrk 463e ,",
    "ueno et al ( 1994 ) report a thermal soft x - ray component with @xmath591 kev .",
    "since mrk 463e and was 49b are galaxy - margers , there is a possibility of on - going starburst activity .",
    "however , there are no reports on the existence of powerful starburst activities in their nuclear regions , and their infrared colors ( log @xmath60/@xmath61 ) in the iras band are about 0 .",
    "therefore , we consider that most soft x - rays are associated with their agn activities .",
    "we note that a possibility of the starburst origin can not be ruled out from our spectral analysis alone .",
    "@xmath55 vs @xmath40 : the x - ray luminosities of optically thin thermal emission from starburst galaxies and normal galaxies are well correlated with far infrared luminosity .",
    "david , jones & forman ( 1992 ) found the strong correlation with @xmath55/@xmath622000 in the 0.54.5 kev band from a detail analysis for a large number of galaxy samples observed by einstein .",

    "thus , the soft components for our target galaxies are most likely to originate from their agn activities rather than starburst activities .",
    "@xmath42 vs @xmath40 : it is known that the x - ray luminosities of seyfert 1 galaxies are well correlated with @xmath42 ( blumenthal , keel , & miller .",
    "1982 ) because broad @xmath41 lines are emitted from photoionized regions .",
    "if the broad @xmath41 lines and nuclear light are scattered in the same region , the luminosity of the scattered @xmath41 lines should correlate with that of the scattered x - ray component .",
    "figure 6 shows a correlation of the soft component and the scattered broad @xmath41 line luminosities ( @xmath63 ) for our sample .",
    "the @xmath63 were estimated using eq.(3.1 ) in tran ( 1995b ) .",

    "the objects in our sample lie in the area of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the consistency of properties between our sample and seyfert 1 galaxies indicates that most of the soft x - rays in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  can be explained by scattered light , and that electron scattering dominates dust scattering for our sample .",
    "this result is consistent with early work by tran ( 1995b ) .    from these relevant considerations ,",
    "we conclude that soft x - rays in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  originate mostly from scattered light .",
    "we note that heckman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) point out that mrk 477 has a powerful nuclear starburst with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath64 .",

    "we do not observe a low - energy cut off and so carbon and oxygen must be ionized in the scatterer .",
    "kallman & mccray ( 1982 ) pointed out that for log @xmath76 , the population of fully ionized carbon and oxygen is @xmath13100 @xmath6 and @xmath830@xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath77 is the ionization parameter with the relation of @xmath77=@xmath78/(@xmath79 ) . in log@xmath80 2 ,",
    "the electron temperature is greater than 10@xmath81 k ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) , which is roughly consistent with the prediction with spectropolarimetry ( e.g. tran 1995b ) .",
    "the ionization parameter,@xmath77 , is calculated from the observed value ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) , i.e. x - ray luminosity and column density of the scatterer .",
    "@xmath82    to obtain a large @xmath77 , the scatterer should be located within 0.3 pc for @xmath71=1 and within 30 pc for @xmath71=10 . for the most probable dusty torus model for seyfert nuclei ( e.g. murayama , mouri , & taniguchi 2000 ) ,",
    "the full height of the torus is estimated to be @xmath83 pc .",
    "assuming @xmath71=1 , the scatterer is located within the torus , while for @xmath71=10 , the scatterer is located outside the torus .",
    "since large @xmath71 is more likely from the analysis of the hard component , the scattering region should be larger than that of the dusty torus .",
    "variability restricts the size of an emitting region . for mrk 3",
    ", long - term monitoring for 10 years shows that although the hard component changed by a factor of 6 during 3 years , no decrease of the soft component was seen .",
    "if most of the soft x - rays from mrk 3 are scattered , the flux of the soft component should decrease within the light travel time from the nucleus to the scattering region .",
    "the large time lag indicates that the distance of the scatterer from the nucleus is comparable to 6 light years ( @xmath13 2 pc ) .",
    "this result supports a large scattering region .",
    "continuous monitoring of mrk 3 in the x - ray band is crucial to verify the location of the scattering region .",
    "ueno ( 1995 ) estimate a ratio of @xmath74 for seyfert 2 galaxies without reports of polarized broad lines using the ratio of the normalization of their soft and hard components ( table 4 ) . for comparison , we show a histogram of @xmath74 for seyfert 2 galaxies with and without reports of polarized broad lines ( figure 7 ) . for typical seyfert 2s ,",
    "the ratios tend to be less than those of pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this is explained either by a stronger soft component or a weaker hard component in pbl seyfert 2 galaxies . to examine which applies",
    ", we compare @xmath37-@xmath55 for both types , assuming that @xmath55 represents the real nuclear activities because their infrared colors are warm except ngc 1068 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "figure 8a shows a color - color diagram of @xmath74 and @xmath84 .",
    "closed circles and open circles represent pbl seyfert 2 and other seyfert 2 galaxies , respectively .",
    "when the absorption correction is applied , there is a clear separation of the two types of seyfert 2 galaxies . for the reflection correction , using @xmath85 in place of @xmath86 ( figure 8b ) , the data are all concentrated in the same region , since pbl seyfert 2s have larger @xmath87 ratios than those of other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this result indicates that the distributions of @xmath88 in figure 7 are due to underestimation of their nuclear activities , and that the scattering efficiencies of pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  are similar to those of other seyfert 2 galaxies , which is a few @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the ratios of @xmath84 of pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  are different from those of other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we propose that the difference is caused by viewing angle .",
    "first , about half of our pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  were selected among seyfert 2 galaxies with high polarization degrees as mentioned by miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) .",
    "if the scattering region is larger than the torus , most of the scattering region is not obscured .",
    "the polarization degree ( @xmath89 ) is described by the function of the viewing angle ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 , where @xmath20 is the value derived from cone angle of the torus ( see miller & goodrich 1990 in detail ) .",
    "the difference in the amount of polarization is explained as other seyfert 2 galaxies having smaller viewing angles than pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "next , the contribution of the compton reflection component in the @xmath1 kev band probably depends on the viewing angle , because most seyfert 2 galaxies with pure reflection in the @xmath1 kev band have an h@xmath92o maser line which is explained by their edge - on geometry ( e.g. matt et al .",
    "1999 for the circinus galaxy , ueno et al .",
    "for ngc 1068 , iwasawa et al . for ngc 4945 ) . furthermore , bassani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find an anti - correlation between iron line equivalent width and @xmath93/@xmath94}}$ ] for a large sample including seyfert 1 galaxies and seyfert 2 galaxies with the h@xmath92o masers .",
    "we suggest that the x - ray properties can be smoothly connected from seyfert 1 galaxies to seyfert 2 galaxies with the h@xmath92o masers lying between `` typical '' seyfert 2 galaxies and pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the separation seen in figure 8a results from smaller @xmath84 for pbl seyfert 2 galaxies , and that @xmath84 decreases as the viewing angle increases .",
    "our picture is consistent with the fact that the viewing angle of mrk 348 is smaller than the other pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  ( tran 1995b ) .",
    "heisler , lumsden , @xmath95 bailey ( 1997 ) proposed that pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  have smaller viewing angle than other seyfert 2 galaxies from the analysis of their extinction,@xmath96 .",
    "however x - ray properties suggest that the scattering region is larger than the torus , and that pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  have larger viewing angle than other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we consider two possibilities to explain the viewing angle dependence of @xmath84 ; 1 ) anisotropic radiation from the seyfert 2 nucleus due to x - ray beaming and 2 ) the existence of thick , clumpy clouds that block a considerable fraction of x - ray photons in the @xmath1 kev band ( figure 9 ) . in the former model , anisotropic radiation can result from a jet structure found in radio band ( ulvestad & wilson 1984 ) .",
    "the latter model is referred to as the dual absorption model ( weaver et al .",
    "1994 ) , in which absorption columns are @xmath9710@xmath39 and @xmath98 for pbl seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "since this model indicates the some fraction of the x - rays are not absorbed by a thick matter , the thick matter should be smaller than the size of x - ray emitting region . in ngc 4258",
    ", it is found that h@xmath92o vapor masing clouds are very small , thick clouds located in its central nuclear region ( miyoshi et al .",
    "thus the masing cloud is one candidate of the thick matter found in our observations .",
    "although we have proposed two possibilities , we have not obtained conclusive result on this issue , because we only obtained the @xmath0 kev spectra with poor statistics .",
    "this is a subject for future missions with large effective area and high energy resolution , such as xmm , astro - e , constellation - x , and xeus .",
    "we analyze the x - ray data for seyfert 2 galaxies which have polarized broad lines in the optical band .",
    "all galaxies show obscured nuclear activities with @xmath1 kev absorption - corrected luminosities of @xmath99 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "however , absorption corrected x - ray luminosities ( @xmath37 ) are less than expected based on predictions from @xmath55 , @xmath42 using relations found in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we examine whether the small x - ray luminosities are real or not , and find that this can be explained if the effects of compton reflection rather than absorption dominate the @xmath1 kev spectra . in this case , the intrinsic x - ray luminosities are consistent with the higher luminosities expected from the amount of reflection .",
    "soft x - ray emission is detected in all galaxies . the x - ray spectrum and correlation of @xmath55-@xmath100 and",
    "@xmath63-@xmath100 reveal that most x - rays in the soft component are scattered light by a warm scatterer .",
    "the typical scattering efficiency derived from the ratio of the soft to apparent hard band luminosity is about 10@xmath6 ; larger than that of seyfert 2 galaxies without polarized broad lines .",
    "this discrepancy can result from an underestimation of intrinsic activity .",
    "the scattering efficiencies deduced from real activities are similar to those of other seyfert 2 galaxies , which are a few @xmath6 .",
    "the small scattering efficiency supports the existence of a large scattering region , as opposed to the compact scattering region proposed by hisler , lumsden , & bailey ( 1997 ) .",
    "we suggest that pbl seyfert 2 galaxies  have larger viewing angles and are seen more edge - on than other seyfert 2 galaxies . for this case , the polarization and the contribution of scattered light in the hard component for seyfert galaxies are naturally explained .",
