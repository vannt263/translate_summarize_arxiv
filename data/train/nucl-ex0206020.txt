    "with the realization of quarks being the basic building blocks of matter and of qcd being the appropriate theory of the strong interaction , the idea emerged that the substructure of baryons should lead to new types of states in the system of two baryons in addition to the `` trivial '' deuteron ground state and @xmath13so virtual state .",
    "indeed , qcd inspired models in the early eighties @xcite predicted a large number of dibaryon states of basic 6q structure . despite a vast number of dedicated experiments in search of such states not a single one could yet be identified unambiguously ; for a review see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the bulk of these searches was devoted to dibaryons which by their quantum numbers could couple to the @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 channels . in these cases the dibaryon states can undergo a fall - apart decay and hence can not be expected to have narrow widths .",
    "their widths should rather be even larger than those of usual baryon resonances , which are in the order of 100 mev and larger .",
    "since such very broad dibaryon resonances would be difficult to sense in experiments , the failure of previous dibaryon searches could at least partly be explained in this way .    on the other hand dibaryon resonances , which by their quantum numbers are decoupled from the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels ,",
    "may be expected to be rather narrow , notably if close to the @xmath12 threshold . actually , such states with @xmath14 and @xmath15 had been predicted by mulders et al .",
    "@xcite at a mass as low as @xmath16 gev / c@xmath8  though more recent theoretical work taking into account proper antisymmetrization @xcite prefers the @xmath17 state at a somewhat higher mass .",
    "recently a candidate for such a decoupled dibaryon state has been proposed for the explanation of an otherwise peculiar , resonance - like structure in the energy dependence of the forward angle cross section of the pionic double charge exchange ( dcx ) on nuclei @xmath18 leading to discrete final states @xcite .",
    "this structure , systematically observed on a wide range of nuclei with peak cross sections at incident energies of @xmath19 - 60 mev , i.e. far below the @xmath20 excitation , has been sucessfully explained both in its energy and angular dependence by the assumption of the formation of a narrow @xmath12 resonance , the so - called @xmath21 , with @xmath22 even @xmath23 , @xmath24 gev / c@xmath8 and @xmath25 mev @xcite .",
    "however , since this reaction takes place in the nuclear medium , subtle medium effects can not be excluded as origin of this structure .",
    "in fact , there have been attempts to describe the observed resonance - like structures in special situations by conventional models @xcite , though a convincing description of the full observed systematics is still lacking .    in order to minimize the effects of the nuclear medium ,",
    "the dcx reaction has also been carried out on @xmath26he and @xmath27he @xcite , i.e. on the lightest nuclei , where this reaction is possible . however",
    ", contrary to the situation with heavier nuclei , there is no longer a bound nuclear state in the exit channel , and the process leads to the nuclear continuum only .",
    "unfortunately , this situation leads to a less pronounced signature of @xmath21 production , in particular , if collision damping of the @xmath21 resonance with the neighbouring nucleons is included @xcite .",
    "hence , the dcx measurements on the he isotopes finally have not been conclusive with regard to the existence of @xmath21 .",
    "also a search on the basic @xmath6 system has been carried out at mami with a high resolution and high statistics measurement @xcite of the reaction @xmath28 . in the range 2020 mev / c@xmath29 mev / c@xmath8",
    "no narrow structures had been found on the @xmath9 level with upper limits in the range of a few microbarn for the production of isoscalar or isovector dibaryons .",
    "however , this limit is still an order of magnitude above the prediction for @xmath21 production @xcite and hence not conclusive for this particular dibaryon candidate either .",
    "the only alternative reaction left in the basic @xmath6 system and simultaneously a potentially much more sensitive test of the @xmath21 hypothesis is the reaction @xmath30 , where @xmath21 can be produced associatedly in a fixed target experiment for projectile beam energies @xmath31 mev , when assuming a mass of @xmath32 gev / c@xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath33 reaction is particularly well suited for this search , since both invariant mass spectra @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be observed simultaneously .",
    "if a resonance shows up in both of these spectra , then its isospin has to be @xmath34 , if it shows up in @xmath3 only , then @xmath35 .",
    "to this aim we have carried out exclusive measurements of the @xmath4 reaction at @xmath5 and 775 mev using the promice / wasa setup @xcite with a hydrogen cluster jet target at the celsius ring .",
    "the ejectiles were detected in the angular range @xmath36 .",
    "protons and pions were identified by the @xmath37 method , @xmath38 particles were in addition positively identified by the delayed pulse originating from @xmath39 decay following the @xmath38 decay at rest .",
    "this way the two - pion production events could be clearly separated from the huge background of charged @xmath40-prong events due to single @xmath41 production with successive dalitz decay or @xmath42 conversion into @xmath43-pairs . as a test of the energy resolution we constructed the missing mass spectrum from identified @xmath0 tracks and obtained a clean single peak at the @xmath44-mass with a width of @xmath45 mev fwhm ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "the four - momenta of the full @xmath46 events were reconstructed by kinematical fits with one over - constraint ( 1c ) .",
    "a total of 1163 , 8016 and 9603 @xmath46 events have been obtained at 725 , 750 and 775 mev , respectively .    > from monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of the detector response we expect an energy resolution of a few mev in @xmath2 similar to that obtained for the @xmath44 peak in the 3-particle missing mass @xmath47 .",
    "note that in the absence of a magnetic field @xmath44 particles have not been detected , only reconstructed .",
    "hence the resolution in @xmath2 can not be improved by using the single - particle missing mass @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath3 the resolution is significantly better , since this spectrum being equivalent to the single - particle missing mass of the @xmath38 is determined by the four - momentum of the detected @xmath38 alone . for the region of @xmath21 ,",
    "i.e. near 2.06 gev / c@xmath8 , we expect in @xmath3 a resolution of fwhm = 3 - 4 mev / c@xmath8",
    "1 shows the @xmath3 spectra obtained from the measurements at @xmath49 and 775 mev .",
    "these spectra , which are not yet corrected for efficiency and acceptance , are compared to mc simulations including detector response .",
    "the dotted lines show the result , assuming pure phase space for the reaction mechanism .",
    "the shaded areas show the result of a model calculation , which quantitatively reproduces all differential cross sections of the @xmath33 reaction at @xmath49 mev @xcite . in this model",
    "the reaction is assumed to proceed via the excitation of the @xmath50 resonance with its subsequent decay into @xmath51 and @xmath52 channels . for a detailed discussion of the reaction process see ref .",
    "@xcite , where also the differential cross sections for other invariant mass systems and angular distributions are presented . within statistics the data are smooth , compare very favorably with the model calculations and , most importantly in the present context , show no narrow structures on the @xmath9 level . to increase the sensitivity to @xmath21 we next",
    "have imposed the condition @xmath53 mev / c@xmath8 on events selected in @xmath3 .",
    "this condition should enhance the events stemming from @xmath21 production relative to those from the conventional process , since @xmath21  if of dibaryonic nature  should be much smaller in volume than the interaction vertex of the conventional process . hence the protons originating from the @xmath21 decay should undergo a much stronger final state interaction , which in turn would lead to an enhancement of events at low @xmath54 masses @xcite . the thus constrained @xmath3 spectra",
    "are shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "again we do not observe narrow structures of statistical significance with the possible exception of a fluctuation at 2087 mev / c@xmath8 , which however is at the high energy end of the accepted range and hence dangerous to interpret .",
    "for a careful investigation of this excursion a measurement at some higher beam energy would be necessary .",
    "there is also still some small enhancement @xmath55 at 2.06 mev / c@xmath8 seen at the lower energy .    for @xmath56",
    "mev the expected location of a possible @xmath21 peak is already very close to the high - energy end of the @xmath3 spectrum , where kinematically the conventional 4-body phase space leads already to a peak - like structure ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this situation",
    "the resolution in @xmath3 and the accumulated statistics turned out to be too low for a meaningful search for @xmath21 , while the situation is more favourable at @xmath49 and 775 mev .    on the basis of roughly 1000 events obtained in a test run @xcite at @xmath49 mev preceeding the high statistics runs presented here",
    "we had found a 4 mev broad structure at 2.063 gev / c@xmath8 in @xmath3 with a statistical significance of @xmath57 to @xmath9 depending on the treatment of the background . in this data analysis",
    "only those @xmath38 events had been taken into account , for which a delayed pulse from the secondary @xmath39 decay was observed in the _ same _ detector element in which the @xmath38 particle was stopped . because of the layer structure of the promice / wasa forward range hodoscope this condition led to previously unknown inefficiencies of @xmath38 detection for distinctive @xmath38 ranges , and energies , respectively .",
    "this situation is reexamined in fig .",
    "2 , where we show the @xmath3 spectra from the present work at 750 mev with an order of magnitude more events than obtained in the test run .",
    "the spectrum is now decomposed into events with a delayed pulse recorded in the same detector element where the @xmath38 stopped ( triangles ) and events with a delayed pulse recorded in a neighbouring element ( open circles ) .",
    "note that positrons originating from @xmath39 decay have a range in plastic detectors of up to 25 cm .",
    "hence the chance of finding a delayed pulse in a neighbouring element and simultaneously none in the same element due to electronic thresholds is not negligible .",
    "we see that the correction due to delayed pulses in the neighbouring elements is largest in the mass range of 2065 to 2070",
    "mev / c@xmath8 corresponding to the transition region from the first to the second layer structure in the detector .",
    "the mc simulations now correctly reproduce these features . adding up the events with delayed pulses in the same and in the neighbouring elements results in the solid dots , where some structure at 2.063 gev / c@xmath8 still remains visible , however , strongly diminished as compared to that in the data denoted by triangles . the artifact nature of at least part of the possible signal reported in ref .",
    "@xcite becomes obvious from this analysis .",
    "we note that in another measurement @xcite aiming to search for @xmath21 in this reaction also a bump near 2.06 gev had been observed in @xmath3 , if a constraint on low @xmath54 masses was imposed .",
    "these measurements conducted at @xmath58 mev at itep had been carried out not on hydrogen but on c and ch@xmath59 targets .",
    "hence the events of interest had to be obtained by subtracting the c data from the ch@xmath59 data .",
    "no follow - up studies have been undertaken to resolve the nature of that bump .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the @xmath2 spectra for @xmath49 and 775 mev . again",
    "no structures of statistical significance are seen .",
    "recall , however , the lower energy resolution in @xmath2 which would wash out narrow structures . in fig .",
    "4 we finally show the differential cross sections for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 distributions following corrections for efficiency and luminosity , and acceptance extrapolated to @xmath60 . from the observed statistical fluctuations in these data we derive an upper limit ( 95% c.l . ) for the production cross section of narrow ( fwhm @xmath61 4 mev ) dibaryons of @xmath62 . with respect to @xmath21",
    "this upper limit is already more than one order of magnitude below the theoretical prediction @xcite of @xmath63 - 1000 nb .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have carried out exclusive measurements of the @xmath4 reaction , which is particularly well suited for the search for @xmath6 decoupled dibaryon resonances . with the exception of the fluctuation observed in @xmath3 at 2087 mev / c@xmath8 ,",
    "i.e. at the high energy end of the covered range , we find no narrow structures neither in @xmath2 nor in @xmath3 within @xmath9 of statistical significance , which could be indicative of dibaryon resonances in the mass range 2022 mev / c@xmath64 mev / c@xmath8 .",
    "we derive an upper limit of 20 nb for their production cross section in this reaction .",
    "in particular for @xmath21 this finding implies a number of consequences .",
    "either it does not exist at all , or its production cross section in this reaction is for some reason much smaller than expected , or its mass outside the nuclear medium is above the mass range investigated here , or it exists only in the presence of a nuclear medium .",
