    "the motivation behind studying these clusters comes from growth processes that arise in physics , such as diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite , anisotropic diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite and the eden model @xcite . in 1998 ,",
    "hastings and levitov @xcite formulated a conformal mapping approach to modelling laplacian growth of which dla and the eden model are special cases .",
    "they defined the family of growth models , @xmath32 , whose construction is described in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath47 version is a candidate for off - lattice dla . in this case , the diameters of the mapped particles are ( more or less ) the same .    the hastings - levitov model has been widely discussed in the physics literature . in the original paper @xcite , hastings and levitov studied the model numerically and found evidence for a phase transition in the growth behaviour at @xmath48 .",
    "further numerical investigations can be seen in , for example , the papers @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we give a brief review of the known results . in 2005 ,",
    "rohde and zinsmeister @xcite established the existence of limit clusters for @xmath50 when the aggregate is scaled by capacity , and showed that the hausdorff dimension of the limit clusters is @xmath11 , almost surely .",
    "they also considered a regularised version of @xmath32 for @xmath49 and estimated the growth rate of the capacity and length of the clusters . in 2009 , johansson and sola @xcite studied loewner chains driven by compound poisson processes .",
    "certain cases of these were found to correspond to @xmath0 clusters with random particle sizes , and the existence of ( one - dimensional ) limit clusters was established .",
    "the 2009 paper of norris and turner explored the evolution of harmonic measure on the boundary of @xmath0 clusters and showed that this converges to the coalescing brownian flow .",
    "we would finally like to mention the 2001 and 2002 papers of carleson and makarov ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where the loewner - kufarev equation is used to describe deterministic versions of laplacian growth . in this paper",
    "we have modified the setup of the hastings - levitov model in the @xmath50 case .",
    "the use of more general distributions for the angles is a way of introducing anisotropy or localization in the growth .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the work of popescu , hentschel , and family @xcite , who study numerically a variant of @xmath51 , where the angles are distributed according to a certain density with @xmath52-fold symmetry .",
    "they suggest that such anisotropic hastings - levitov models may provide a description for the growth of bacterial colonies where the concentration of nutrients is directional .",
    "we discuss their work further in the next section .",
    "allowing for non - uniform angular distributions results in scaling limits in which the anisotropy is reflected .",
    "we consider two different natural scaling limits where we scale the particle sizes .",
    "we prove a shape theorem that describes the global macroscopic behaviour of the cluster : in the case of uniformly distributed angles , the shape is a disk ( as was previously known @xcite ) ; but in the anisotropic case the limit shapes can be realised as non - trivial loewner hulls .",
    "for the anisotropic case we also show that the evolution of harmonic measure on the cluster boundary is deterministic with small random fluctuations , unlike in the uniform case where the behaviour is purely stochastic .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review some background material concerning the loewner equation and the coalescing brownian flow and describe the general framework of our paper .",
    "we also discuss some examples of angular distributions that lead to interesting anisotropic behaviour in the growth . in section 3 ,",
    "we establish continuity properties of the loewner - kufarev equation with respect to measures , and use this to prove a shape theorem for the limit clusters . in section 4 , we consider the evolution of harmonic measure on the cluster boundary . for general measures ,",
    "we first prove that the flow on the boundary is described by an deterministic ordinary differential equation , and then obtain a description of the stochastic fluctuations around this deterministic flow .",
    "finally , we show that uniformly chosen angles lead to purely stochastic behaviour , even if the particle sizes are chosen randomly .",
