    "the investigation of interacting electronic systems is one of the most intriguing , albeit difficult , subjects in condensed matter physics .",
    "the same is true for the study of disordered , non - interacting electrons . in view of the theoretical complexity of the two problems taken separately",
    "it is understandable that their combination , i.e.  the _ simultaneous _ presence of randomness and interactions , as found in many real systems ( e.g. doped semiconductors near the metal - insulator transition , high-@xmath0 superconducting materials close to @xmath0 , etc . ) , leads to new , fundamental questions to which only few secured answers are known .",
    "this is all the more true when the interaction and/or the disorder is strong , since there exist hardly any tractable , and at the same time controlled , theoretical method of investigation in this limit .",
    "an important starting point for the investigation of interacting , disordered systems was the field - theoretic approach developed for the treatment of non - interacting electrons , i.e.  the scaling theory of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this theory to finite interactions by finkelshtein @xcite provided essential new insight @xcite .",
    "however , the appearance of local magnetic moments in the renormalization group treatment discovered by him @xcite and castellani et al . @xcite turned out to be a fundamental obstacle for the study of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) itself @xcite . a microscopic origin of this instability towards the formation of localized moments",
    "can already be traced within hartree fock theory for the disordered hubbard model ( `` anderson - hubbard model '' ) with off - diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the above renormalization - group approach , as well as is starting point , i.  e. anderson - localization , are not appropriate when it comes to the investigation of three - dimensional disordered electrons with intermediate or strong interactions close to half - filling ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "after all , a mit occurs even without disorder in this case , and the lattice periodicity becomes essential .",
    "a non - perturbative and qualitatively quite different , but essentially uncontrolled , renormalization technique by which disorder and interactions can be treated on equal footing is the real space renormalization group approach .",
    "it was first applied by ma @xcite and recently used by yi et al .",
    "@xcite to investigate the anderson - hubbard model with diagonal disorder , i.e. random on - site energies , in dimensions @xmath2 at @xmath3 and in @xmath4 for @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "however , in these investigations the formation of antiferromagnetic long range order ( aflro ) which will always set in at large enough repulsion ( at least at @xmath3 ) was not considered at all .",
    "the strong coupling limit of this model was studied by zimanyi and abrahams @xcite using a slave - boson formulation of the corresponding @xmath6 model .",
    "the considerably simpler , but still highly non - trivial , case of disordered , _ spinless _ fermions in @xmath7 was also addressed recently @xcite .    to obtain a global picture of the properties of interacting , disordered systems",
    "it is desirable to know the solution of a simple , microscopic model which is valid for all input parameters ( interaction , disorder , temperature , band filling ) .",
    "since exact solutions are not available in @xmath8 one would like to construct , at least , a thermodynamically consistent mean - field theory that is valid also at strong coupling .",
    "such a ( non - perturbative ) approximation is provided by the exact solution of a model in @xmath9 .",
    "it is now known that even in the limit @xmath10 @xcite the hubbard interaction remains dynamical @xcite and leads to a highly non - trivial single - site problem @xcite with infinitely many coupled quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "this problem is , in fact , equivalent with an anderson impurity model complemented by a self - consistency condition @xcite and is thus amenable to numerical investigations within a finite - temperature quantum monte - carlo approach @xcite . in the absence of disorder",
    "this technique was already used by several groups to investigate the magnetic phase diagram @xcite , the mott - hubbard transition @xcite , transport properties @xcite , and lately also superconductivity in a two - band version @xcite of the hubbard model in @xmath9 .",
    "these investigations were also extended to the periodic anderson model @xcite and the holstein model @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory of interacting electrons obtained in the limit @xmath9 has many appealing features ; however , it also has its limitations which are due to the purely local nature of the theory .",
    "one effect which can not be described within the @xmath9 mean - field theory of disordered electrons is the phenomenon of anderson localization .",
    "that is , the electrons in infinite dimensions are delocalized for arbitrary strength of the disorder .",
    "the absence of localized states is caused by the above mentioned single - site dependence , i.e.  by the fact that momentum dependence enters the physical quantities only through the dispersion relation whereby vertex corrections to the conductivity vanish identically @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown @xcite that for vanishing interaction , when the anderson - hubbard model reduces to the anderson disorder model , the well - known and much - used `` coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) '' @xcite , which does not describe anderson localization , yields the _ exact _ solution in @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless it should be stressed that even in the absence of anderson localization the presence of disorder can have a significant , non - trivial effect on the properties of an interacting system .",
    "first results of a quantum monte - carlo study of the competition between disorder and interaction in the anderson - hubbard in @xmath9 with diagonal `` binary alloy '' disorder were recently reported by us @xcite .",
    "the importance of separable , off - diagonal disorder in the formation of local moments and the mott transition was investigated by dobrosavljevi and kotliar @xcite .    a good impression of how complicated the phase diagram and the dynamical properties of interacting electrons with and without disorder are may be inferred from the results for spinless electron in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the interactions reduce to their hartree - contribution in this case @xcite , i.e.  are no longer dynamical , does not at all imply that the properties of the model become trivial  quite the contrary .",
    "many details of this model can be obtained analytically in @xmath9 , thereby providing valuable insight into the effects of interactions @xcite , the interplay between interaction and disorder @xcite , and the @xmath9 limit itself @xcite .",
    "the correlations caused by interactions between electrons and by the scattering of electrons in a disordered medium , respectively , can be very different ; indeed , they may lead to opposite effects .",
    "for example , even an arbitrarily weak repulsive hubbard interaction between electrons on a bipartite lattice will induce aflro when the band filling is sufficiently close to @xmath3 ( at least in dimensions @xmath11 ) .",
    "by contrast , it is the very nature of a random potential to oppose order .",
    "hence interactions and disorder are expected to compete with each other .",
    "this conclusion may appear self - evident and almost trivial but is really only based on a simple - minded superposition of the two individual physical effects ( which may , in fact , be quite correct for weak interactions and disorder ) . when the interaction and/or disorder is strong , however , this picture looses its basis . in general the mutual interplay of those two effects",
    "can be expected to lead to _ novel _ , non - perturbative , quantum - mechanical many - body phenomena , e.g. new phases , which have no analog in non - random , interacting or disordered , non - interacting systems .    in view of the interplay between disorder and interaction",
    "there are a number of simple questions whose answers will be non - trivial , for example    1 .",
    "is there a _ finite _ disorder strength above which aflro ceases to exist ?",
    "( after all , the fluctuations of the ensembles around the average value @xmath3 induced by the disorder might become so large that aflro is made impossible ) .",
    "2 .   does disorder always _ reduce _ the critical temperature for aflro , as one might expect intuitively ?",
    "do interactions always drive a system _ away _ from metallic behavior into an insulating state ? 4 .",
    "how important is the choice of disorder distribution on the results ?",
    "these are questions which need to be answered by means of controlled investigations of a well - defined microscopic model .",
    "it is our intention in this paper to provide explicit , numerically exact answers to the above questions within the dynamical mean - field theory obtained in the limit of high spatial dimensions .",
    "a preliminary account was presented in ref .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the model and discuss the form of the corresponding averaged free energy in @xmath9 . in sect .  3 we calculate correlation functions , i.e.  the averaged compressibility and staggered susceptibility , to determine the thermodynamic stability of various phases .",
    "the details of the model ( input parameters , disorder distribution etc . ) are specified and the numerical procedure is discussed in sect .  4 .",
    "this leads to the construction of the magnetic phase diagram in sect .",
    "5 . in sect .  6",
    "the results on magnetic phase transitions are then complemented by those on metal - insulator transitions .",
    "a discussion of the combined phase transition scenario closes the presentation .",
    "the simplest microscopic hamiltonian for conduction electrons interacting via the local hubbard interaction in a disordered system is the so - called anderson - hubbard model , which can be written as @xmath12 here @xmath13 create ( annihilate ) a @xmath14-electron on site @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the chemical potential of the @xmath14-electrons . in general",
    "both the hopping amplitude @xmath18 and the atomic energies @xmath19 in ( [ gl1 ] ) depend on the configuration of the atoms distributed on the lattice . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of uncorrelated , diagonal disorder .",
    "hence we assume the hopping elements to be independent of the randomness ( with @xmath20 for nearest neighbor sites and @xmath21 otherwise ) while the atomic potentials @xmath19 are chosen as random , their distribution being purely local ; thus short - range order is neglected .",
    "the hamiltonian under investigation is then given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the usual hubbard model @xmath24 here the hopping matrix element was written as @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the number of nearest - neighbors on the lattice ( e.g. @xmath27 on hypercubic lattices in @xmath28 dimensions ) .",
    "this scaling ensures that ( [ gl3 ] ) remains non - trivial even in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "we can then write the averaged full energy ( grand potential ) as    [ gl5 ] @xmath30 where @xmath31 . here",
    "the average over the disorder is defined as usual as @xmath32 x ( \\epsilon_1 , \\ldots , \\epsilon_l ) \\label{gl5b}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the number of lattice sites , and @xmath34 is the distribution of the random potentials @xmath19 .",
    "the explicit form of the function @xmath34 will be specified later .    in realistic dimensions",
    "@xmath35 it is impossible to perform the trace over all fermionic states in ( [ gl2 ] ) exactly .",
    "however , in the limit of infinite coordination number or spatial dimensions significant simplifications occur in the evaluation of thermodynamic properties .",
    "two of us recently showed @xcite that the averaged grand potential of the disordered hubbard model in @xmath9 can be reduced to an expression where the averaging is performed only on a single site .",
    "the explicit expression for the grand potential in the paramagnetic phase is given by @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\[10pt ] & + &   \\beta^{-1 } \\sum_{\\sigma n } \\ln g_{\\sigma n}^{-1 } - \\beta^{-1 } \\big\\langle \\ln { \\cal z } \\ { { \\cal g}^{-1 } , \\epsilon_i \\ } \\big\\rangle_{av } \\quad , \\label{gl6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the density of states of non - interacting electrons , @xmath38 are matsubara frequencies and the generalized atomic partition function @xmath39 is represented by a grassmann functional integral    [ gl7 ] @xmath40 with the local action @xmath41 \\label{gl7b}\\ ] ]    here @xmath42 are grassmann variables that depend on the imaginary time @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are their fourier transforms into @xmath45-space . only the random potentials @xmath19 are configuration dependent .",
    "furthermore , @xmath46 is an effective local propagator of the electrons .",
    "the grand potential ( [ gl6 ] ) is a functional of the complex quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 which at this point enter as variational parameters .",
    "that is , the _ physical _ values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( namely , the local green function , @xmath49 , and the self - energy , @xmath50 , of the electrons , respectively ) correspond to those for which ( [ gl5 ] ) is stationary @xcite .",
    "each term of @xmath51 in ( [ gl6 ] ) has a clear mean - field interpretation , which allows us to outline a simple construction of @xmath51 on a mean - field level @xcite .",
    "we first introduce a homogeneous @xcite , effective , energy - dependent potential @xmath48 which is defined in such a way that in the thermodynamic limit the system of disordered , interacting electrons is equivalently described by a system of non - interacting electrons in the potential @xmath52 .",
    "the free energy @xmath53 is now constructed as follows @xcite : ( i ) we start with the free energy of non - interacting electrons in the potential @xmath48 ( first term in ( [ gl6 ] ) ) , ( ii ) then we remove the potential @xmath48 from site @xmath15 , i.  e. subtract its energy contribution ( second term in ( [ gl6 ] ) ) , and ( iii ) replace it by the potential @xmath54 , and finally average over @xmath55 ( last term in ( [ gl6 ] ) ) @xcite . to determine the potential @xmath48 we demand that the free energy obtained by this construction be stationary under variation of @xmath48 , i.  e. @xmath56 .",
    "this is a self - consistent equation for @xmath48 .",
    "the major advantage of the mean - field grand potential ( [ gl6 ] ) is the property that the variational parameters are not explicitly configuration dependent @xcite , i.e.  they are determined only by _",
    "averaged _ quantities which result from the averaging in ( [ gl6 ] ) .",
    "since the averaging is local , the disorder only leads to local correlations on the same site .",
    "different lattice sites are effectively decoupled and all the information about the surrounding sites is contained in the effective potential @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , @xmath48 is a generalization of the `` coherent potential '' known from the theory of random alloys @xcite .",
    "this may be seen as follows @xcite : if we neglect the hubbard interaction @xmath57 , the grassmann functional integral ( [ gl7a ] ) becomes gaussian and can be performed exactly , leading to @xmath58 \\nonumber \\\\[10pt ] & + & \\langle \\ln ( 1 + g_{\\sigma n } ( \\sigma_{\\sigma n } - \\epsilon_i ) ) \\rangle_{av } \\big\\ } \\label{gl9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is precisely the grand potential of a random alloy with non - interacting electrons within cpa , with @xmath48 as the coherent potential expressed in matsubara frequencies @xcite .",
    "hence ( [ gl6 ] ) can be understood as a field - theoretic generalization of the cpa to random alloys with _ interacting _ electrons which becomes exact for @xmath59 .",
    "it should be noted that the averaged grand potential ( [ gl6 ] ) does not contain the complete information about the equilibrium physics of random systems @xcite .",
    "for example , averaged _ products _ of green functions contain new , non - trivial correlations and can not be derived from ( [ gl6 ] ) .",
    "the averaged grand potential does , however , carry the full information about the equilibrium _",
    "thermodynamics _ of the model .",
    "we concentrate in our paper exclusively on the thermodynamics of the anderson - hubbard model .",
    "it is well - known that , for large enough @xmath57 , the hubbard model itself leads to aflro at ( or even close to ) half - filling .",
    "this type of long range order must therefore be considered even in the presence of disorder .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we investigate only aflro on bipartite lattices . in this case the breaking of symmetry is caused by a staggered magnetic field @xmath60 with ( @xmath61 on @xmath62- and ( @xmath63 ) on @xmath64-sites . to be able to study this type of order quantitatively",
    "we extend the averaged grand potential ( [ gl6 ] ) to the symmetry - broken phase .",

    "deviations from the square - root behavior of @xmath255 set in at lower temperatures .",
    "in the preceding section we found that at weak coupling the disorder suppresses the aflro . in the ground state",
    "the system is then a disordered paramagnet . whether it is metallic or not depends on the type and strength of the disorder . in @xmath9 , where anderson localization does not occur [ 38,39 ]",

    "@xmath141 , the exact result in @xmath9 ( obtained by cpa @xcite ) is @xmath257 .    for @xmath258",
    "there are two equivalent criteria to decide on whether the ground state in @xmath9 is metallic or insulating .",
    "they correspond to ( i ) a _ spectral _ definition of an insulator , based on the disappearance of the dos at the fermi level ( assuming that only extended electrons are present ) , and ( ii ) a _ thermodynamic _ definition , employing the disappearance of the compressibility @xcite .",
    "however , in interacting systems these two criteria need not coincide .",
    "hence we will investigate both . in fig .",
    "10a the averaged compressibility @xmath96 of interacting electrons in the presence of binary - alloy disorder is shown as a function of @xmath57 for @xmath259 .",
    "hence @xmath96 is calculated across the line @xmath260 in fig .  4a , i.e.  within the paramagnetic and the antiferromagnetic phase , respectively ( the transition points are indicated by arrows ) .",
    "for a given @xmath261 the curves display a common behavior as a function of @xmath57 : @xmath96 is ( exponentially ) small at @xmath141 , then increases and , at @xmath262 , approaches a maximum , beyond which it becomes ( exponentially ) small again for @xmath213 .",
    "this behavior has a clear physical interpretation : for @xmath242 , with @xmath261 , the double occupancy of lattice sites is at its maximum value ( @xmath263 ) , at the same time the kinetic energy can not delocalize these states .",
    "hence the system is insulating . at @xmath264 and @xmath141",
    "this is an exact property for @xmath265 ( split - band limit ) in @xmath9 . as @xmath57 increases the on - site coulomb repulsion forces the particles to separate from each other .",
    "as a consequence the particles become less localized . we then expect that , at some critical value @xmath266 , a macroscopic fraction of the electrons becomes extended and the system starts to be metallic .",
    "this real - space picture has its analogy in @xmath112-space ( or w.r.t .",
    "energy ) : as the interaction increases the previously separated bands change their shapes , i.e.  the interaction - induced energy exchange between particles leads to a transfer of states into the energy gap where the fermi energy is located . at the critical value",
    "@xmath266 the ( still algebraic ) band edges reach the fermi level , producing a finite dos there as well as a finite overall compressibility .",
    "( we can not rule out that @xmath267 , i.e.  that the dos at the fermi level is finite even at arbitrarily small @xmath57 ; however , this would require the bands to acquire exponential tails  a feature which can not be observed numerically ) .",
    "hence , in contrast to an interacting system without disorder the coulomb interaction in a disordered system is able to _ improve _ the metallicity of the system and may even turn an insulator into a metal . apparently the interaction - induced energy exchange smooths the energy spectrum of the disordered system , thus leading to an easier transfer of energy .    for @xmath268 the system is then expected to be a metal without fermi liquid properties ( since @xmath269 ) , at least in @xmath9 . as @xmath57 is further increased the dos and @xmath96 increase , reaching a maximum at @xmath262 .",
    "for even larger @xmath57 the effect of pushing states into the gap is reversed and @xmath96 decreases again .",
    "hence at some critical value @xmath270 a _ second _ transition occurs , back into an insulating state , where doubly occupied sites are almost completely suppressed , whereby the mobility is obstructed by the repulsive interaction .    in fig .",
    "10b @xmath96 for the continuous , semi - elliptic disorder distribution is shown . here",
    "@xmath96 behaves qualitatively as in the non - random case , i.e.  @xmath96 decreases monotonically since the dos does not split at @xmath271 .",
    "this reduction of @xmath96 occurs in two steps : for @xmath272 @xmath96 decreases almost linearly with @xmath57 , corresponding to the linear suppression of doubly occupied sites @xmath241 , or @xmath273 ( see fig .",
    "8a ) ; in this region the system is metallic but not a fermi liquid .",
    "then , for @xmath274 , when the number of doubly occupied sites is almost zero so that the local moments are almost saturated , @xmath96 approaches zero ( exponentially ) slowly . strictly speaking , at finite temperatures one has @xmath275 for @xmath276 .",

    "in this paper we presented a detailed , quantitative study of the physical effects caused by the simultaneous presence of interactions and randomness in a system of lattice electrons . to this end",
    "we investigated the anderson - hubbard model with diagonal disorder at half filling in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions , i.e.  within a dynamical mean - field theory , for three different disorder distributions .",
    "numerical results were obtained by employing quantum monte carlo techniques that provide an explicit finite - temperature solution of the model in @xmath9 .",
    "no further approximation were used .    to construct the thermodynamic phase diagram we derived and evaluated the appropriate averaged two - particle correlation function , i.e.  a dynamical response function , whose poles determine the magnetic instabilities of the disordered , interacting system . only this function  and not the averaged staggered susceptibility @xmath144 itself , which is only a weighted sum of the response function over the ( matsubara ) frequencies  fulfills a closed equation that determines the two - particle spectrum .",
    "the value of the response function at the lowest frequency is the most sensitive indicator for an instability of the system . in the temperature dependence of @xmath144 two distinct disorder regimes",
    "are observed : ( i ) for weak disorder the curie - weiss law holds , while ( ii ) at strong disorder @xmath144 acquires a maximum at a temperature below which a crossover from the temperature- to the disorder- dominated regime takes place .",
    "we demonstrated that at low temperatures and sufficiently strong interaction there always exists a phase with antiferromagnetic long - range order ( aflro ) .",
    "furthermore we discovered a new strong - coupling anomaly , namely that the nel - temperature @xmath194 is not always a monotonously decreasing function of disorder .",
    "indeed , at strong coupling and not too large disorder @xmath194 is always found to be an _ increasing _ function of disorder , i.e.  disorder favors the formation of aflro in this regime .",
    "this implies the existence of an unexpected _ disorder - induced _ transition to a phase with aflro . under the assumption that @xmath194 is proportional to the effective exchange coupling between spins even in the disordered system we proved that for diagonal disorder",
    "the anomalous behavior is generic , i.e.  is independent of the type of disorder distribution .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that for diagonal disorder the difference between the local energies of neighboring sites becomes _ smaller _ on average , thus leading to stronger effective exchange coupling .",
    "we then studied the existence of metal - insulator transitions in the anderson - hubbard model .",
    "although in @xmath9 anderson localization does not take place the presence of disorder may well have other strong effects .",
    "in particular , binary - alloy disorder is able to cause band - splitting ( thereby resembling the effect of genuine interactions ) and hence may induce a metal - insulator transition all by itself .",
    "special attention was given to the question whether or not the disorder allows for the stabilization of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) _",
    "metal_. to this end the average compressibility @xmath96 was evaluated both in the paramagnetic ( p ) and af phase .",
    "contrary to our expectation the presence of disorder was found to enhance the metallicity of the af - phase close to the p - af transition .",
    "this enhancement strongly suggests the existence of an af metal in the low - temperature phase of the anderson - hubbard mode . to investigate whether this af phase persists to be metallic down to @xmath320 , at least in @xmath9",
    ", we studied the frequency components of the one - particle green function and of @xmath96 , respectively , down to @xmath290 , our lowest temperature .",
    "however , a reliable answer to this question can only be found at still lower temperatures , which at present are beyond the reach of the finite - temperature monte carlo techniques used here . in any case , the transition scenario involving metal - insulator and p - af transitions obtained for the anderson - hubbard model is remarkably rich .",
    "for alloy - type disorder with @xmath265 ( split - band limit for @xmath324 ) at @xmath320 an increase of the interaction @xmath57 from zero will probably first lead to a transition from a paramagnetic insulator to a paramagnetic metal at @xmath266 , then , at @xmath277 , to an antiferromagnetic metal and finally , at @xmath270 , to an antiferromagnetic insulator .",

    "<S> numerical results are obtained for three different disorder distributions by employing quantum monte carlo techniques which provide an explicit finite - temperature solution of the model in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic phase diagram is constructed from the zeros of the inverse averaged staggered susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at low enough temperatures and sufficiently strong interaction there always exists a phase with antiferromagnetic long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> a novel strong coupling anomaly , i.e.  an _ increase _ of the nel - temperature for increasing disorder , is discovered . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit explanation is given which shows that in the case of diagonal disorder this is a generic effect . </S>",
    "<S>  the existence of metal - insulator transitions is studied by evaluating the averaged compressibility both in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase . a rich transition scenario , involving metal - insulator and magnetic transitions , is found and its dependence on the choice of the disorder distribution is discussed . </S>"
