    "we consider a finite flake of bernal stacked bilayer graphene with a quantum dot defined in its inside and edges of a zigzag and/or armchair form . since the study requires a careful description of the boundaries we use the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite instead of its continuous low - energy approximation.@xcite we account for the dots diameter up to 50 nm and the flakes of areas up to @xmath3 nm@xmath4 .",
    "we find that when the flake contains zigzag edges the localized states within the quantum dots are not separated by any energy gap from the external ones and evidence of coupling between these states is found in the energy spectra .",

    "we find that the coupling to the edges lifts the valley degeneracy of the dot - localized states .",
    "we also extract the smooth envelope functions from the rapidly varying tight - binding solutions near the fermi energy , and compare the symmetries of the calculated wave functions with the ones expected for the dirac hamiltonian of the continuum approximation for circular potentials and infinite graphene plane.@xcite",

    "@xcite in this work we assume that opposite potentials are applied to the two layers which allows for conservation of the electron - hole symmetry for carefully chosen shape of the flake . in experiments with bilayer graphene the potential within the two layers is routinely applied in an independent manner,@xcite to control both the width of the electric - field induced energy gap and its position with respect to the fermi energy .",

    "this is an evidence that proximity of the armchair edges also contributes to lifting the valley degeneracy of the dot - localized states .",
    "let us now consider a very large flake of a side length of 80 nm and consider the energy spectrum in function of the dot size ( see fig .",
    "[ stanyr ] ) .",
    "we find that : i ) the energies of dot - localized states decrease as @xmath60 in agreement with the dirac calculations @xcite ; ii ) the states localized outside the dot  which in this energy range corresponds to the states localized at the zigzag dangling edges  are completely insensitive to the size of the dot ; iii ) the avoided crossings between the dot and the edge are not resolved at this scale ; iv ) the valley degeneracy of the dot - localized states is nearly exact at this size of the flake .",

    ", we obtain the energy increase and hence the lowering of the gap with the increasing bias .    in fig .",
    "[ stanyt ] we notice , that the valley degeneracy of the dot - localized states is restored when the size of the triangle increases .",

    "only , the avoided crossings with states extending from the zigzag edges  visible for the rectangular flake  are no longer present for the triangular flake .",
    "we have seen that the zigzag edges mix the dot - localized states with the states in the rest of the flake .",
    "a natural question arises whether the atomic size defects would introduce a similar mixing . in order to answer this question we introduced the vacancies to the system considered in the triangular flake of fig .",

    "the vacancies introduce two energy levels at @xmath24 in the absence of the bias .",
    "we assumed a missing atom of the 2b sublattice of the upper layer and a missing atom of the 1b sublattice of the lower layer .",
    "the vacancy energy level of the lower layer which falls for increasing @xmath17 enters into an avoided crossing with the dot localized energy level near @xmath66 ev and thus lifts the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the energy level associated with removed 2b sublattice atom changes much strongly with @xmath17 , since the vacancy lifts the interlayer coupling .",

    "[ vacan](b ) we introduced a third vacancy inside the dot area in the lower graphene layer .",
    "this vacancy gives rise to an extra energy level @xmath67 mev localized inside the dot with no further consequences to the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the results presented above indicate that for large bilayer flakes containing zigzag edges the dot - localized and extended states appear in the same energy range . it does not imply that the idea for electrostatic confinement in bilayer graphene does not work . in fig .",

    "<S> zigzag boundaries the dot - localized energy levels appear interlaced with the energy levels outside the flake , so in a charging experiment the electrons will be added alternately to the dot area and to its neighborhood . we demonstrate that for flakes with armchair boundaries only , an energy window accessible uniquely to the dot - localized states is formed . </S>",
    "<S> then a number of electrons can be added to the dot before the external states start to be occupied . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss coupling of the dot - localized states to the edge - states in the context of the valley degeneracy lifting . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we extract smooth envelope wave functions from the tight binding solution and discuss their spatial symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the dot localized energy levels with reconstructed zigzag edges and atomic vacancies present within the layers is also considered . </S>"
