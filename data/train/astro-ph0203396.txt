    "m81 is an sab spiral galaxy hosting a low luminosity seyfert nucleus which shows the characteristics of a `` low ionization nuclear emission - line region '' ( liner , @xcite ) .",
    "it was first observed in x ",
    "rays with _ einstein _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) which resolved several discrete sources in m81 , the brightest of which is associated with its active nucleus .",
    "an apparently diffuse emission component associated with the bulge of m81 , spatially extended over a few arcminutes was detected first with _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) and later confirmed with chandra data ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectra from _ rosat _",
    "( @xcite ) , _ bbxrt _ ( @xcite ) , _ asca _ ( @xcite ) and _ bepposax _ ( @xcite ) suggested the presence of a soft ( @xmath3 1 kev ) thermal component in addition to an absorbed power law component from the nucleus . in this paper",
    "we present the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum of m81 at much higher resolution , from an observation with the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs , @xcite ) .",
    "m81 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ in april 2001 for a total of 138 ks .",
    "the rgs data were reduced using the _ xmm - newton _ standard analysis software ( sas ) version 5.2 .",
    "the source spectrum was extracted from a region centred on the nucleus , enclosing 90% of the point spread function in the cross dispersion direction .",
    "background regions were selected in the cross - dispersion direction so as to exclude 99% of the nuclear point spread function .",
    "figure  [ mpage - c2_fig : rgsspectrum ] shows the rgs spectrum . a number of prominent emission lines from h - like and",
    "he - like n , o , and ne as well as l shell lines from fe xvii and fe xviii are visible above the continuum ; these are labelled in figure  [ mpage - c2_fig : rgsspectrum ] .",
    "the lines are considerably broader than the rgs line spread function for a point source . for example , o viii ly@xmath4 at @xmath5   is expected to have relatively little contamination from neigbouring lines , but a gaussian fit to this line shows that it is inconsistent with @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "this broadening could be due to kinematic motions in the gas , for example if it is associated with the active nucleus .",
    "however a similar level of line broadening would result from the gas being extended over a region of @xmath8 2 arcminutes , because the rgs is a slitless dispersive spectrograph and its resolution is degraded for extended objects .    to distinguish these alternatives ,",
    "we have examined the spatial distribution of the emission line gas in the rgs cross dispersion direction by constructing spectra in @xmath9 wide strips at a range of distances from the nucleus of m81 .",
    "a background spectrum was constructed from the average of the two most off - axis strips .",
    "the emission - line rich 14 - 20   parts of these spectra are shown in figure  [ mpage - c2_fig : crosscuts ] .",
    "the emission line gas is extended over more than an arcminute implying that the excess broadening of the emission lines is due to their spatial extent rather than kinematic motions .",
    "we further investigate the nature of the emission line gas using plasma diagnositics from the he - like ovii triplet , as described in @xcite .",
    "taking the 21 - 23   portion of the rgs spectrum , we fitted the ovii lines as 3 gaussians with the relative wavelengths of the resonance ( w ) , intercombination ( x+y ) and forbidden ( z ) lines fixed at their theoretical ratios .",
    "the best fit has an acceptable @xmath10 , and is shown superimposed on the 21 - 23   rgs spectrum in figure  [ mpage - c2_fig : oxygenplots]a . in figure",
    "[ mpage - c2_fig : oxygenplots]b we show the confidence contour of the ( x+y+z ) against w line strength .",
    "the solid line shows the line ratio g ( = ( x+y+z)/w ) = 4 .",
    "plasmas in which photoionization is the dominant ionization mechanism are expected to have ratios to the left of this line ( i.e. g @xmath11 4 ) ; this is ruled out at 95% confidence in m81 . in plasmas with line ratios to the right of this line , such as that seen in m81 ,",
    "collisional excitation is important and may be the dominant emission mechanism .",
    "figure  [ mpage - c2_fig : oxygenplots]c shows confidence contours of the density diagnostic z against ( x+y ) . the line shown on the plot corresponding to ratio r ( = z/(x+y ) ) = 1 is excluded at @xmath12 along with all of parameter space to the right of this line , implying that the line emitting plasma has a density of @xmath13 .",

    "we obtained a ( @xmath41 ) for an intrinsic absorber with a column density of @xmath42 5 @xmath43 .",
    "the fit parameters of this fit , and subsequent fits , are given in table [ mpage - c2_tab : totalfits ] .",
    "we next attempted to model the emission line component .",
    "as shown in section [ mpage - c2_sec : emissionlines ] the o vii triplet is consistent with an origin in a collisionally ionized gas .",
    "we therefore began modelling the emission lines by adding a single temperature ` mekal ' thermal plasma to the absorbed power law model .",
    "this resulted in a significant improvement in the fit ( @xmath44 ) for a plasma temperature of @xmath45 kev .",
    "however , the emission lines are too narrow in this model , and some emission lines , most noticably those from ovii , have much lower intensities in the model than in the observed spectrum .",
    "we therefore added a second , lower temperature , mekal component to the model , and at both mekal temperatures we added components with positive and negative velocities of 1500 km s@xmath46 to reproduce the width of the lines caused by the spatial extent of the emission region .",
    "the relative normalisations of the rest , + 1500 km s@xmath46 and -1500 km s@xmath46 components were allowed to vary freely , but the temperatures were tied in the fit ; the fluxes given for these model components in table [ mpage - c2_tab : totalfits ] are the totals for all three ` velocity ' components .",
    "this resulted in a significant improvement in @xmath47 , reproducing most of the emission lines well , with the second plasma component at a best fit temperature of @xmath48 kev .",
    "however , the blend of ne x with fe xxii - xxiii at @xmath49   is still underproduced by this model , and so a third , higher temperature , mekal plasma was added . this resulted in another significant improvement in the fit , to a final @xmath50 , with a best fit temperature for the third mekal component of @xmath2 kev .",
    "the model reproduces the spectrum well , as shown in figure  [ mpage - c2_fig : rgsfit ] .",
    "in section [ mpage - c2_sec : emissionlines ] we showed that the soft x ",
    "ray emission lines in m81 come from an extended region .",
    "we also showed that the diagnostic ovii triplet is emitted by a low density region and is not powered by photoionization from the central agn .",
    "furthermore , in the previous section we showed that a 3 temperature thermal plasma model provides a good description of the emission line component of the m81 rgs spectrum in conjunction with absorbed powerlaw emission from the nucleus .",
    "two of the thermal plasma components have temperatures of @xmath36 kev and @xmath38 kev , which are too low to be produced by accreting binaries , and are instead more characteristic of the hot interstellar medium produced by supernova explosions ; in this case we would expect these emission lines to come from a genuinely diffuse region ( or regions ) in the bulge of m81 .",
    "the x  ray imaging study performed with _",
    "chandra _ does indeed find diffuse emission from the bulge of m81 .",
    "the luminosity of this unresolved bulge emission reported by @xcite is @xmath51 erg s@xmath46 ( 0.2 - 8 kev ) assuming a distance of 3.6 mpc to m81 .",
    "assuming the same distance , the 0.18 kev and 0.64 kev thermal plasma components from our best fit model in table 1 have luminosities of @xmath52 erg s@xmath46 and @xmath53 erg s@xmath46 respectively over the same energy range - sufficient to completely account for the unresolved bulge emission .",
    "if the emission associated with the highest of the three plasma temperatures ( @xmath2 kev ) were also produced by a hot interstellar medium , or by a large population of very low luminosity sources such as cataclysmic variables , it would also appear diffuse in the _ chandra _ imaging .",
    "however , the two lower temperature plasma components alone completely account for the unresolved emission , and hence the higher temperature emission must arise in part of the bulge population resolved by _",
    "chandra_. we propose x - ray binaries as the most likely origin of the higher temperature emission ."
