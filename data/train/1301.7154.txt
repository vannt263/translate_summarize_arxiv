    "* klee s measure problem ( * kmp * ) * asks for the volume of the union of @xmath0 axis - aligned boxes in @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is considered to be a constant .",
    "this is a classic problem with a long history  @xcite .",
    "the fastest algorithm has runtime @xmath13 for @xmath14 , given by overmars and yap  @xcite , which was slightly improved to @xmath15 by chan  @xcite .",
    "thus , for over twenty years there has been no improvement over the runtime bound @xmath16 . as already expressed in  @xcite , one might conjecture that no _ improved _ algorithm for kmp  exists , i.e. , no algorithm with runtime @xmath8 for some @xmath17 .",
    "however , no matching lower bound is known , not even under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions .",
    "the best unconditional lower bound is @xmath18 for any dimension",
    "@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "chan  @xcite proved that kmp  is @xmath6$]-hard by giving a reduction to the @xmath3-clique problem . since his reduction has @xmath19 , we can transfer runtime lower bounds from @xmath3-clique to kmp , implying that there is no @xmath7 algorithm for kmp  assuming the exponential time hypothesis ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , this does not determine the correct constant in the exponent .",
    "moreover , chan argues that since no `` purely combinatorial '' algorithm with runtime @xmath20 is known for clique , it might be that there is no such algorithm with runtime @xmath21 for kmp , but this does not rule out faster algorithms using , e.g. , fast matrix multiplication techniques .",
    "since no further progress was made for kmp  for a long time , research turned to the study of special cases . over the years , the following special cases have been investigated . for each one we list the asymptotically fastest results .    *",
    "* cube - kmp : * here the given boxes are cubes , not necessarily all with the same side length .",
    "this case can be solved in time @xmath22 for @xmath14  @xcite . in dimension @xmath23",
    "this has been improved to @xmath24 by agarwal  @xcite . in dimensions @xmath25 even the general case can be solved in time @xmath26 , the same bound clearly applies to this special case . as described in  @xcite , there are simple reductions showing that the case of cubes is roughly the same as the case of `` @xmath27-fat boxes '' , where all side lengths of a box differ by at most a constant factor @xmath27 . * * unitcube - kmp : * here the given boxes are cubes , all of the same side length .",
    "this is a specialization of cube - kmp , so all algorithms from above apply .",
    "the combinatorial complexity of a union of unit cubes is @xmath28  @xcite . using this , there are algorithms with runtime @xmath29  @xcite and @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "again , there is a generalization to `` @xmath27-fat boxes of roughly equal size '' , and any algorithm for unitcube - kmp  can be adapted to an algorithm for this generalization  @xcite . *",
    "* hypervolume : * here all boxes have a common vertex . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that they share the vertex @xmath31 and lie in the positive orthant  @xmath32 .",
    "this special case is of particular interest for practice , as it is used as an indicator of the quality of a set of points in the field of evolutionary multi - objective optimization  @xcite . improving upon the general case of kmp",
    ", there is an algorithm with runtime @xmath26 for @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the same paper also shows an unconditional lower bound of @xmath18 for @xmath33 , while @xmath34-hardness in the number of dimensions was shown in  @xcite .",
    "recently , an algorithm with runtime @xmath35 for @xmath36 was presented in  @xcite .",
    "* * @xmath3-grounded : * here the projection of the input boxes to the first @xmath3 dimensions is a hypervolume  instance , where @xmath37 , the other coordinates are arbitrary .",
    "this rather novel special case appeared in  @xcite , where an algorithm with runtime @xmath38 for @xmath36 was given for @xmath10-grounded .",
    "note that for none of these special cases @xmath6$]-hardness is known , so there is no larger lower bound than @xmath18 ( for constant or slowly growing @xmath12 ) , not even under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions .",
    "also note that there are trivial inclusions of some of these special cases : each special case can be seen as a subset of all instances of the general case . as such subsets ,",
    "the following inclusions hold",
    ".    * @xmath39 .",
    "* @xmath40 for all @xmath3 . * @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this allows to transfer some results listed above to other special cases .",
    "e.g. , the cube - kmp  algorithm with runtime @xmath22 also applies to unitcube - kmp .",
    "we present several reductions among the above four special cases and the general case of kmp .",
    "they provide bounds on the runtimes needed for these variants and , thus , yield some order among the special cases .",
    "our first reduction relates hypervolume  and unitcube - kmp .",
    "[ thm : hypuckmp ] if there is an algorithm for unitcube - kmp  with runtime @xmath43 , then there is an algorithm for hypervolume  with runtime @xmath44    note that if hypervolume  were a subset of unitcube - kmp , then the same statement would hold , with the constant hidden by the @xmath45-notation being  1 .",
    "hence , this reduction can nearly be seen as an inclusion .",
    "moreover , together with the trivial inclusions this reduction establishes hypervolume  as the easiest of all studied special cases .",
    "[ cor : nlogn ] for all studied special cases , hypervolume , unitcube - kmp , cube - kmp , and @xmath3-grounded ( for any @xmath37 ) , we have the unconditional lower bound @xmath18 for any @xmath33 .",
    "one can find contradicting statements regarding the feasibility of a reduction as in theorem  [ thm : hypuckmp ] in the literature .",
    "on the one hand , existence of such a reduction has been mentioned in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a newer paper  @xcite contains this sentence : `` better bounds have been obtained for the kmp on unit cubes ... , but reducing the hypervolume indicator to such problems is not possible in general . '' in any case , to the best of our knowledge a proof of such a statement can not be found anywhere in the literature .",
    "our second reduction substantiates the intuition that the special cases cube - kmp  and unitcube - kmp  are very similar , by showing that their runtimes differ by at most a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "recall that @xmath47 was one of the trivial inclusions .",
    "we prove an inequality in the other direction in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : uckmpckmp ] if there is an algorithm for unitcube - kmp  with runtime @xmath43 , then there is an algorithm for cube - kmp  with runtime @xmath48    our third and last reduction finally allows to show lower bounds for all special cases .",
    "we show an inequality between the general case of kmp  and @xmath49-grounded , in the opposite direction than the trivial inclusions . for this",
    ", we have to increase the dimension in which we consider @xmath49-grounded .",
    "[ thm : thereduction ] if there is an algorithm for @xmath49-grounded in dimension @xmath50 with runtime @xmath51 , then there is an algorithm for kmp  in dimension @xmath12 with runtime @xmath52    note that , if we set @xmath53 , the special case @xmath49-grounded in @xmath50 dimensions becomes hypervolume  in @xmath54 dimensions .",
    "since we established hypervolume  as the easiest variant , the above reduction allows to transfer @xmath6$]-hardness from the general case to all special cases .",
    "since the dimension is increased only by a constant factor , even the tight lower bound on the runtime can be transferred to all special cases .",
    "[ cor : wone ] there is no @xmath7 algorithm for any of the special cases hypervolume , unitcube - kmp , cube - kmp , and @xmath3-grounded , assuming the exponential time hypothesis .",
    "we immediately get more precise lower bounds if we assume that no improved algorithm exists for kmp  ( no algorithm with runtime @xmath8 ) .",
    "if there is no improved algorithm for kmp , then there is no algorithm with runtime @xmath9 for any of hypervolume , unitcube - kmp , cube - kmp , and @xmath3-grounded , for any @xmath17 .",
    "this shows the first lower bound for all studied special cases that is larger than @xmath18 .",
    "note that there is , however , a wide gap to the best known upper bound of @xmath22 for hypervolume , unitcube - kmp , and cube - kmp .",
    "furthermore , setting @xmath55 , theorem  [ thm : thereduction ] immediately implies that the recent algorithm for @xmath10-grounded with runtime @xmath38  @xcite is optimal ( apart from logarithmic factors and if there is no improved algorithm for kmp ) .",
    "[ cor : grnd2 ] if there is no improved algorithm for kmp , then there is no algorithm for @xmath10-grounded with runtime @xmath56 for any @xmath17 .",
    "to simplify our runtime bounds , in some proofs we use the following technical lemma .",
    "informally , it states that for any @xmath3-grounded algorithm with runtime @xmath4 we have @xmath57 .",
    "note that in this paper we hide by the @xmath45-notation any functions depending solely on @xmath12 .",
