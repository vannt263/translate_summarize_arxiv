    "recent discoveries of slow - moving objects beyond the orbit of neptune have radically changed our understanding of the outer solar system .",
    "these observations have revealed a large population of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) in orbits with semi - major axes of 3945 au ( @xcite , 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "kbos with reliable orbits have a cumulative size distribution that follows @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated population of @xmath13 kbos with radii @xmath16 50 km indicates a total mass , @xmath17 g ] , for reasonable assumptions about the albedo and distance distribution .    the small mass in kbos is a problem for current planet formation theories . in most theories , small planetesimals in the solar nebula",
    "grow by collisional accumulation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , 1984 ; @xcite , 1993 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this growth eventually produces one or more ` cores ' that accumulate most , if not all , of the solid mass in an annular ` feeding zone ' defined by balancing the gravity of the growing planetesimal with the gravity of the sun and the rest of the disk .",
    "large cores with masses of 110 @xmath18 can also accrete gas from the feeding zone ( @xcite ) .",
    "applied to the inner solar system , this model generally accounts for the masses of the terrestrial and gas giant planets ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; but see @xcite ) . at 3050 au , however , the timescale to produce planet - sized , @xmath19 1000  km , objects exceeds the disk lifetime , @xmath20 100 myr , unless the mass of the outer disk is @xmath21@xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite , 1984 ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of large kbos in a small mass kuiper belt is thus a mystery .    in kenyon & luu ( 1998 , hereafter kl98 )",
    ", we began to address this issue by considering planetesimal growth in a single annulus at 35 au .",
    "we showed that calculations including accretion and velocity evolution naturally produce several `` plutos '' with radii exceeding 1000 km and numerous 50 km radius kbos on timescales of @xmath23 20200 myr for a wide range of initial conditions in plausible solar nebulae .",
    "these timescales indicate that pluto can form in the outer solar system in parallel with the condensation of the outermost large planets .    in this paper , we extend kl98 by adding fragmentation to our planetesimal evolution code .",
    "the code generally matches published calculations at 1 au ( wetherill & stewart 1993 , hereafter ws93 ) and at 40 au ( davis & farinella 1997 ) .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that fragmentation and velocity evolution damp runaway growth to provide a self - limiting mechanism for the formation of kbos and pluto in the kuiper belt .",
    "these calculations produce several plutos and at least @xmath24 50 km radius kbos on timescales of 2100 myr in annuli with modest surface densities , 2.00.14 g @xmath25 , of solid material at 35 au .",
    "our analysis sets a lower limit on the intrinsic strength of kbos , @xmath19 300 erg g@xmath8 , and indicates that the initial size distribution , the initial eccentricity of the planetesimal swarm , and the details of the fragmentation algorithm have little impact on the resulting size distribution of kbos .",
    "our results appear to resolve the mystery of large kbos in a small mass kuiper belt .",
    "planetesimal evolution at 3550 au in a minimum mass solar nebula ( @xcite ) naturally produces large kbos in numbers close to those currently observed .",
    "most of the disk mass ends up in smaller objects , 0.110 km , that can be collisionally depleted over the age of the solar system .",
    "this depletion rate depends on the intrinsic strength and eccentricity distribution of kbos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1997b ) .",
    "future observations can place better constraints on these physical parameters and provide additional tests of our interpretation of kbo formation .",
    "we outline the fragmentation model and tests in sec .",
    "2 , describe calculations for the kuiper belt in sec . 3 , and conclude with a discussion and summary in sec .",
    "the appendix contains a complete description of the fragmentation algorithms and updates of the coagulation code from kl98 .",
    "as in kl98 , we adopt safronov s ( 1969 ) particle - in - a - box method , where planetesimals are treated as a statistical ensemble of masses with a distribution of horizontal and vertical velocities about a keplerian orbit .",
    "our calculations begin with a differential mass distribution @xmath26 ) in a single accumulation zone centered at a heliocentric distance @xmath27 with an inner radius at @xmath28 and an outer radius at @xmath29 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical velocity dispersions of these bodies are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we approximate the continuous distribution of particle masses with discrete batches having particle populations @xmath32 and total masses @xmath33 ( ws93 ) .",
    "the average mass of a batch , @xmath34 = @xmath35 , changes with time as collisions add and remove bodies from the batch .",
    "this procedure naturally conserves mass and allows a coarser grid than calculations with fixed mass bins ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to evolve the mass and velocity distributions in time",
    ", we solve the coagulation and energy conservation equations for an ensemble of objects with masses ranging from @xmath36  g to @xmath37 g. the appendix of kl98 describes our treatment of accretion and velocity evolution , and compares numerical results with analytic solutions for standard test cases . in this paper , we add fragmentation to the problem .",
    "we adopt a simple treatment of collision outcomes , following greenberg ( 1978 ; see also @xcite , 1994 ; ws93 ) :    4ex 1 .",
    "mergers  two bodies collide and merge into a single object with no debris ;    \\2 .",
    "cratering  two bodies merge into a single object but produce debris with a mass much smaller than the mass of the merged object ;    \\3 .",
    "rebounds  two bodies collide and produce some debris but do not merge into a single object ; and    \\4 . disruption  two bodies collide and produce debris with a mass comparable to the mass of the two initial bodies .",
    "4ex    we consider two algorithms for treating the cratering and disruption of planetesimals .",
    "both the ws93 and the davis ( 1984 ) algorithms estimate the amount of debris @xmath38 produced from impacts with velocities exceeding a threshold velocity @xmath39 .",
    "in general , @xmath38 scales with the impact energy .",
    "ws93 assume that the debris has the same relative velocity @xmath40 of the colliding bodies ; davis ( 1984 ) assume that the debris receives a fixed fraction @xmath41 of the impact kinetic energy .",
    "in both cases , we adopt a coefficient of restitution @xmath42 to allow for rebound collisions that produce debris but no single merged body .",
    "we follow greenberg ( 1978 ) and adopt separate values of @xmath42 for collisions with ( @xmath43 ) and without ( @xmath44 ) cratering .",
    "the appendix describes these algorithms in more detail .    to test our fragmentation procedures",
    ", we attempt to duplicate ws93 s calculations of planetary embryo formation at 1 au .",
    "their model begins with 8.33 @xmath45 planetesimals having radii of 8 km and a velocity dispersion of 4.7 m s@xmath8 relative to a keplerian orbit ( table 1 ; see also table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "table 2 summarizes our results using the ws93 initial conditions with mass spacing factors of @xmath46 = 1.12 , 1.25 , 1.4 , and 2.0 between successive mass batches .",
    "we adopt the analytic cross - sections of spaute ( 1991 ) , which yield results identical to the numerical cross - sections of ws93 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 shows our reproduction of ws93 for @xmath47 .",
    "this model produces twelve 37 @xmath48 g objects with velocity dispersions of 60100 m s@xmath8 in 1.15 @xmath49 yr .",
    "in contrast , ws93 produce seven 13 @xmath50 g objects ( see figures 13 in ws93 ) . despite this factor of two difference in the total mass contained in the most massive bodies ,",
    "our calculation has the same broad `` plateau '' in the cumulative number distribution @xmath51 at log @xmath52 = 2426 and a similar power law dependence , @xmath53 , at log @xmath52 = 2123 .",
    "our `` fragmentation tail '' at log @xmath52 = 718 has the standard power law dependence , @xmath54 ( @xcite ) , at large masses but flattens out more than the ws93 result at small masses .",
    "the evolution of particle velocities in our calculations generally agrees with ws93 ( figure 2 ; see figures 23 of ws93 ) .",
    "all velocities increase monotonically with time due to viscous stirring .",
    "the velocities of large bodies grow very slowly , because dynamical friction transfers their kinetic energy to small bodies .",
    "the model maintains a nearly constant ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity , @xmath55 0.53 , for all but the most massive bodies , which have @xmath56 ( figure 2 , right panel ) .",
    "this result agrees with previous calculations ( barge & pellat 1990 , 1991 ; @xcite ) . at late times , our velocities for small bodies , @xmath57 200 m",
    "s@xmath8 at @xmath58 g , are roughly a factor of two larger than those of ws93 .",
    "velocities for large bodies , @xmath57 100 m s@xmath8 at @xmath59 g , roughly equal those of ws93 .",
    "the higher velocities of our calculation lead to additional mass loss from gas drag and fragmentation .",
    "gas drag removes material from the annulus ; fragmentation produces bodies with masses less than the minimum mass , @xmath60 g , of our numerical grid .",
    "we typically lose @xmath19 25% of the initial mass to cratering and catastrophic fragmentation and another 20%25% to gas drag .",
    "ws93 lost a comparable amount of mass to fragmentation but only @xmath19 5% to gas drag .",
    "the agreement between our results and those of ws93 depends on the mass spacing factor @xmath61 . for @xmath62 30,000 yr , large @xmath61 models take longer to produce 10002000 km objects than small @xmath61 models .",
    "the ` lag ' relative to our @xmath61 = 1.12 model increases from 1%2% for @xmath61 = 1.25 up to @xmath19 10% for @xmath61 = 2 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; kl98 ) .",
    "the poor resolution of @xmath63 models delays the production of massive bodies that ` runaway ' from the rest of the mass distribution . in ws93 ,",
    "most runaway bodies are also ` isolated ' bodies that do not interact with one another but do interact with the rest of the mass distribution ( see ws93 and the appendix ) .",
    "delays in the production of isolated , runaway bodies lead to 10%20% increases in the velocity dispersion of all bodies .",
    "larger velocities reduce gravitational focusing factors and slow the growth of the largest bodies .",
    "the mass of the largest object thus increases from 78 @xmath64 g for @xmath61 = 1.251.4 to @xmath65 g for @xmath61 = 1.12 .",
    "this trend suggests that calculations with @xmath61 = 1.011.10 , as in ws93 , would improve the agreement between our results and those of ws93 .",
    "the coagulation results also depend on the treatment of low velocity collisions .",
    "our standard expressions for long - range gravitational interactions fail when the velocity dispersion is close to the hill velocity , @xmath66 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use ida s ( 1990 ) @xmath67-body calculations and adopt his simple expressions to derive the velocity evolution for collisions in the low velocity limit , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 = 25 is a constant ( see the appendix ) .",
    "this change slows down the velocity evolution , because it introduces a lower limit to the timescales for dynamical friction and the inclination component of viscous stirring ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath69 = 2 , following ws93 , for 1 au calculations .",
    "unlike ws93 , however , the small bodies in our calculation do not quite reach the low velocity limit and increase in velocity throughout the evolution .",
    "a modest increase in our low velocity limit , @xmath69 = 3.5 , leads to better agreement between the velocity behavior of our models and that of ws93 .    to test our procedures further ,",
    "we repeat the 1 au calculations using the davis ( 1984 ) fragmentation algorithm .",
    "table 3 lists our results for @xmath41 = 0.1 and @xmath61 = 1.25 , 1.4 , and 2.0 .",
    "these calculations yield solutions similar to our ws93 models .",
    "calculations with smaller @xmath61 produce larger bodies at earlier times than models with large @xmath61 ( table 3 ) . the mass of the largest object increases from @xmath70 g for @xmath61 = 2.0 to @xmath71 g for @xmath61 = 1.4 to @xmath72 g for @xmath61 = 1.25 .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the small bodies are a factor of 23 larger at @xmath73 30,000 yr because they receive a larger fraction of the fragmentation energy than in the ws93 algorithm .",
    "this trend reverses for @xmath74 50,000 yr , because the davis algorithm produces more debris for collisions between large objects than the ws93 algorithm .",
    "these large objects have small velocity dispersions , so the velocity dispersions of the small bodies increase more slowly than in the ws93 model . the mass lost from fragmentation , @xmath19 5% of the initial mass , and gas drag , @xmath19 20% of the initial mass , is also smaller .",
    "we conclude that our coagulation code with fragmentation and velocity evolution reproduces ` standard ' calculations .",
    "the results in tables 23 generally agree with published results , despite some differences in the evolution of the velocity dispersion and the radius of the largest object .",
    "these discrepancies probably result from subtle differences in the implementation of the algorithms .",
    "none seem significant , because the major results do not depend on the input parameters ( see also ws93 ) : all calculations produce several objects with @xmath75 g that contain most of the remaining mass in the annulus .",
    "as in kl98 , we rely on observations of other stellar systems and solar nebula models to choose appropriate initial conditions for our kuiper belt calculations .",
    "recent observations indicate lifetimes of @xmath19 510 myr for typical gaseous disks surrounding nearby pre  main - sequence stars and for the solar nebula ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our solar system ,",
    "neptune formation places another constraint on the kbo growth time , because neptune excites kbos through gravitational perturbations .",
    "recent calculations suggest neptune can form in 5100 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once formed , neptune inhibits kbo formation at 3040 au by increasing particle random velocities on timescales of 20100 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we thus adopt 100 myr as an upper limit to the kbo formation timescale at 3040 au .",
    "our starting conditions for kbo calculations are similar to kl98 .",
    "we consider an annulus centered at 35 au with a width of 6 au .",
    "this annulus can accommodate at least 10100 isolated bodies with @xmath76 g for @xmath77 . instead of the single starting radius used in kl98 ,",
    "the present calculations begin with @xmath78 bodies in a size distribution with radii , @xmath79 = 180 m. this initial population has a power law cumulative size distribution , @xmath80 .",
    "we usually adopt @xmath81 ; the final size distribution appears to depend very little on @xmath82 , as discussed below .",
    "the planetesimals have a small initial eccentricity ( @xcite ) that is independent of size and an equilibrium ratio of inclination to eccentricity , @xmath83 = 0.6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass density of each body is 1.5 g @xmath84 . to set the initial mass of the annulus , @xmath4 , we extend the minimum mass solar nebula to the kuiper belt and integrate the surface density distribution for solid particles , @xmath85 , across the 6 au annulus .",
    "the dust mass is then @xmath86 at 3238 au for @xmath87 = 1  au .",
    "most minimum mass solar nebula models have @xmath88 = 3060 g @xmath25 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which sets @xmath89 715 @xmath18 .",
    "we consider models with @xmath4 = 1100 @xmath18 to allow for additional uncertainty in @xmath88 .",
    "table 1 compares input parameters for kuiper belt models with initial conditions at 1 au ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our success criteria are based on available observations of kbos .",
    "the present day kuiper belt contains ( a ) at least one object ( pluto ) with radius @xmath3 1000 km and ( b ) @xmath19 70,000 objects with radii exceeding 50 km ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ) .",
    "a successful kbo calculation must satisfy both observed properties in @xmath20 100 myr .",
    "we quantify these criteria by defining @xmath90 as the radius of the largest object and @xmath91 as the radius where the cumulative number of objects is @xmath92 : a successful simulation has @xmath93 1000 km and @xmath94 50 km at @xmath62 100 myr . to provide another characteristic of these models ,",
    "we define @xmath95 such that 95% of the mass is contained in objects with @xmath96 . in models with a long runaway growth phase ,",
    "the largest objects contain most of the mass and @xmath97 .",
    "models with a limited runaway growth phase leave most of the mass in small objects , so @xmath98 .",
    "we end calculations with velocity evolution when @xmath90 exceeds @xmath19 1000 km .",
    "to evaluate the dependence of runaway growth on fragmentation , we extend calculations without velocity evolution to 5000 myr or to when @xmath90 exceeds @xmath19 20003000 km .      to isolate how fragmentation changes the growth of kbos",
    ", we begin with constant velocity calculations of accretion .",
    "the initial size distribution has @xmath81 , @xmath61 = 1.4 , and a maximum initial radius of @xmath99 = 80 m. the initial velocities of @xmath100 = 4 m s@xmath8 and @xmath101 = 2.1 m s@xmath8 correspond to an equilibrium model with @xmath102 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the davis ( 1985 ) fragmentation algorithm and assume that the collision fragments receive a kinetic energy per unit mass equal to one - half of the square of the relative velocity of the colliding bodies , @xmath40 .",
    "the bodies are strong , with a tensile strength @xmath103 erg g@xmath8 .",
    "tables 1 and 4 summarize the initial conditions and results for models with @xmath4 = 1100 @xmath18 , @xmath5 = @xmath104 , and the coefficients of restitution , ( @xmath44,@xmath43 ) = ( @xmath105,@xmath105 ) and ( @xmath106,@xmath104 ) .",

    "the low coefficients of restitution eliminate rebound collisions .",

    "these bodies reach @xmath109 10 km at @xmath107 135 myr and grow to 100  km sizes at 255 myr .",
    "the growth rate then increases considerably due to gravitational focusing . runaway growth ensues .",
    "the largest planetesimals reach @xmath110 200  km at @xmath107 265  myr ; @xmath90 exceeds 1000  km only 11  myr later . at @xmath107 280",
    "myr , a single runaway body with @xmath110 2000  km begins to sweep up lower mass planetesimals and contains nearly all of the mass in the annulus a few myr later .",
    "the cumulative size distribution of small objects with @xmath111 100 m slowly approaches a power law with @xmath112 throughout the evolution .",
    "the distribution is shallow , @xmath113 , for @xmath62 20 myr as growth produces many 50500 m objects .",
    "the distribution steepens as the largest bodies grow past 1 km and settles at @xmath112 for @xmath74 150 myr .",
    "this distribution is steeper than the theoretical limit of @xmath114 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , because growth and fragmentation never reach equilibrium .",
    "calculations with rebound collisions yield similar results . with larger coefficients of restitution , ( @xmath44,@xmath43 )",
    "= ( @xmath106,@xmath104 ) , rebound collisions occur for @xmath111 5 m. these collisions produce fragments but no mergers into larger bodies . as a result ,",
    "the size distribution is initially very steep for @xmath111 5 m and very shallow for @xmath115 5 m ( figure 4 ) .",
    "as the largest objects grow from 1 km to 10 km at @xmath116 = 16135 myr , bodies with @xmath111 5 m are swept up by the large bodies and replaced by collision fragments .",
    "this process smooths out the size distribution at @xmath109 120 m , although the slope still changes at @xmath109 5 m.    the evolution of the largest bodies is unaffected by rebounds .",
    "these objects reach sizes of 100 km only slightly later than models without rebounds , 258 myr _ vs _ 255 myr , and then begin to runaway from lower mass planetesimals .",
    "several objects reach radii of 1000 km in another @xmath19 20 myr and then begin to consume all of the material left in the annulus .",
    "fragmentation is not important in any of these low eccentricity calculations .",
    "catastrophic fragmentation produces no mass loss . because the velocities remain artificially low .",
    "these models lose only 1%3% of their initial mass due to cratering .",
    "the timescale to grow into a 1000 km object is nearly identical to models without fragmentation ( see kl98 ) : pluto forms in @xmath11 276280 myr ( @xmath117)@xmath8 for @xmath99 = 80 m. calculations with larger @xmath99 should have smaller growth times ( see kl98 ) .      to understand how fragmentation changes the velocity dispersions of colliding planetesimals , we consider calculations with ` limited ' velocity evolution .",
    "as in davis ( 1985 , 1994 ) , we assume that collision fragments receive a fixed fraction @xmath41 of the center - of - mass impact energy , but consider no other changes to the kinetic energy of the bodies . for most collisions",
    ", this assumption produces fragments with velocities larger than the relative collision velocity @xmath40 . to conserve kinetic energy , the merged bodies have a lower velocity dispersion after the collision .",
    "this redistribution of velocity mimics dynamical friction and should lead to more rapid growth than models with no velocity evolution .",
    "table 5 summarizes results for @xmath5 = @xmath104 , @xmath103 erg g@xmath8 , and coefficients of restitution , ( @xmath118 ) = ( @xmath119 ) , for our standard mass distribution with @xmath81 , @xmath61 = 1.4 , and @xmath99 = 80 m.    figure 5 shows how @xmath51 evolves with time for @xmath4 = 10 @xmath18 . during the first 1020 myr",
    ", the size distribution has two power laws , @xmath120 for @xmath111 5 m and @xmath121 for @xmath115 5 m. this break in the slope is due to rebounds , which prevent growth of the smallest objects . as the largest objects grow to sizes of 110 km , collision debris adds to the population of 5  m objects .",

    "collisions between the largest bodies , @xmath124 100500 m , add material with high velocity dispersion to batches with @xmath109 110 m. the horizontal velocity dispersions of these low mass objects increase from 4 m s@xmath8 to 1030 m s@xmath8 in 17 myr and reach a roughly constant value of @xmath19 20 m s@xmath8 after 200 myr ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this large velocity dispersion initially slows down the growth of the largest objects relative to models with no velocity evolution .",
    "it takes this model @xmath19 1 myr longer to produce objects with @xmath109 1 km , but these objects then have velocities @xmath19 1 m s@xmath8 smaller than the initial velocity of the planetesimal swarm ( see figure 6 ) .",

    "these models are nearly indistinguishable for @xmath125 10 km .",
    "the limited velocity evolution models then produce larger objects on shorter timescales .",
    "these models do not have a mass - dependent velocity evolution such as viscous stirring or dynamical friction , so the timescale to produce 1000 km objects is still inversely proportional to the mass in the annulus , @xmath9 = 216 myr @xmath126 for @xmath5 = @xmath104 .",
    "other than the accelerated growth rate at late times , there is little difference between models with limited velocity evolution and models with no velocity evolution ( see tables 45 ) .",
    "both sets produce comparable numbers of large kbos , @xmath115 100 km , that contain most of the mass in the annulus when the first pluto forms .",
    "these models also lose @xmath19 1%3% of their initial mass due to cratering .",
    "the mass loss depends solely on the total kinetic energy of all the bodies , which is a constant in these models .",
    "catastrophic fragmentation still produces no mass loss , because we assume relatively strong objects with @xmath103 erg g@xmath8 .",
    "we describe models with weaker bodies in the next section .",
    "we now consider a complete coagulation calculation with fragmentation and velocity evolution .",
    "in addition to velocity redistribution from fragmentation , these models include ( i ) gas drag , ( ii ) dynamical friction and viscous stirring from long - range ( elastic ) collisions , and ( iii ) dynamical friction and viscous stirring from short - range ( inelastic ) collisions ( see the appendix of kl98 ) . to approximate the disappearance of the solar nebula on reasonable timescales , we assume that the gas density decays exponentially with time , @xmath127 where @xmath128 g @xmath84 ( ws93 and references therein ) .",

    "as described in kl98 , our accretion model assumes that planetesimals are a statistical ensemble of masses in a cylindrical annulus of width @xmath188 and height @xmath189 centered at a radius @xmath27 from the sun .",
    "the particles have horizontal @xmath30 and vertical @xmath31 velocity dispersions relative to an orbit with mean keplerian velocity @xmath190 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we approximate the continuous distribution of particle masses with discrete batches having an integral number of particles @xmath32 and total masses @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average mass of a batch , @xmath34 = @xmath35 , evolves with time as collisions add and remove bodies from the batch .    to compute the evolution of particle numbers and velocities in kl98",
    ", we solved the coagulation equation and a set of velocity evolution equations for all mass bins @xmath191 during a time step @xmath192 .",
    "we assumed that bodies merge but do not fragment during collisions .",
    "we conserved kinetic energy in each collision and adopted a kinetic approximation to calculate velocity changes due to gas drag , dynamical friction , and viscous stirring .",
    "our explicit algorithm for solving these equations reproduced standard tests and other published calculations .          where @xmath195 is the cross - section , @xmath196 for @xmath197 and @xmath198 for @xmath199 .",
    "the four terms in a1a2 represent ( i ) mergers of @xmath52 and @xmath200 into a body of mass @xmath201 , ( ii ) loss of @xmath202 through mergers with other bodies , ( iii ) addition of @xmath202 from debris produced by the collisions of other bodies , and ( iv ) loss of @xmath202 by gas drag .",
    "we consider below the mass lost to small fragments @xmath203 .",
    "the second term in a1a2 includes the possibility that a collision can produce debris but no merger ( rebounds ) . as in kl98",
    ", we calculate the `` gravitational range '' of the largest bodies ",
    "@xmath204 ( @xcite )  where @xmath205 and @xmath206^{1/3}$ ] is the mutual hill radius . as in ws93 ,",
    "the isolated bodies are the @xmath207 largest bodies that satisfy the summation , @xmath208 .",
    "these isolated bodies can not collide with one another but can collide with other lower mass bodies .    as in kl98",
    ", we solve the complete set of evolution equations , a1a2 above and a7a8 from kl98 , using an explicit method that limits the time step automatically to prevent large changes in the dynamical variables .",
    "section 2 of the main text compares calculations at 1 au with results from ws93 . in the rest of this appendix",
    ", we describe fragmentation algorithms ( a.2 ) and updates to our velocity evolution algorithm ( a.3 ) .",
    "algorithms for collision outcomes rely on comparisons between the kinetic energy of the two colliding planetesimals @xmath209 and the binding energy of the merged planetesimal @xmath210 .",
    "the binding energy usually consists of an intrinsic tensile strength and the gravitational binding energy , @xmath211 .",
    "this ` energy scaling ' approach is sometimes replaced by other scaling laws to model the structure of the colliding bodies more accurately .",
    "for example , housen and collaborators ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1994 ) describe a strain - rate scaling model to express the collision energy needed to disrupt a body in terms of its size and impact velocity .",
    "davis ( 1994 ) showed that both types of model can match observations of the asteroid belt in our solar system ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we adopt an energy scaling model .",
    "energy scaling has two main advantages for calculating the fragmentation of kuiper belt objects .",
    "the wide use of this approach allows us to compare results with many previous calculations .",
    "other models also seem inappropriate for the low velocity collisions anticipated in the kuiper belt .",
    "these models have been scaled for conditions in the inner solar system , where collision velocities exceed 100 m s@xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the approximations made for these collision velocities fail when the impact velocity is smaller than 1001000 m s@xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite , p. 239 ) .",
    "we expect velocities of @xmath1 10 m s@xmath8 for most collisions in the kuiper belt ( kl98 ) , and thus can not apply the housen ( 1990 ) and other sophisticated models in our calculations .",
    "the output of any fragmentation algorithm is the mass of the merger remnant @xmath202 and the mass distribution of the fragments .",
    "we assume @xmath201 , where @xmath203 is the mass of fragments _ ejected _ from the merged planetesimal .",
    "we consider two approaches to compute @xmath203 . in the first case ,",
    "we follow ws93 and set the impact velocity as      where @xmath40 is the relative velocity of the two colliding bodies ( equation a12 of kl98 ) and @xmath213 = @xmath214 is the mutual escape velocity . the center of mass fragmentation energy @xmath215 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath216 per unit mass are            ws93 and most other studies assume that collisions produce debris when ( i ) the impact velocity exceeds a threshold velocity , @xmath223 , and ( ii ) the amount of ejected mass exceeds a threshold value , @xmath224 . the mass ejected in the collision is derived from simple energy considerations .",
    "the collision _ disrupts _ the merged object if the collision energy exceeds the binding energy , @xmath225 , where @xmath6 is the impact strength .",
    "in most of their calculations , ws93 further require that the mass fragmented by the impact exceed half of the mass of the merged object , @xmath226 , where the fragmented mass is ( @xcite , 84 ) :            if the conditions for catastrophic disruption are not met , the collision produces a large body with @xmath230 and numerous small fragments with total mass @xmath38 ( a6 ) .",
    "ws93 assume that the amount of the fragmented mass that escapes the merged body is              where @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 ( @xcite ) .",
    "tests show that this distribution produces results similar to those of ws93 when we assume that the velocity of the escaping fragments equals the relative velocity of the colliding planetesimals , @xmath40 ( see section 2 ) .    as a comparison to the ws93 fragmentation algorithm",
    ", we consider the davis ( 1985 ; @xcite , 1984 ; @xcite ) approach .",
    "we adopt their energy scaling formula and write the strength ( in erg g@xmath8 ) of a planetesimal as :      where @xmath241 is a constant .",
    "we adopt @xmath241 = 1 in the absence of any useful estimates for kuiper belt objects ; davis ( 1985 , 1994 ) consider @xmath241 = 1100 for collisional evolution in the asteroid belt ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "davis assume that the ejecta receive a fixed fraction @xmath242 of the impact energy and have a power law mass - velocity distribution ,      where @xmath244 is a reference velocity .",
    "the impact energy needed to disrupt the planetesimal and accelerate 50% of the fragments to escape velocity follows from integration of ( a12 ) and energy conservation ( @xcite ) :      davis assume that collisions produce debris when the impact velocity exceeds a threshold , @xmath223 .",
    "we also adopt the ws93 threshold for the ejected mass , @xmath224 .",
    "the collision disrupts the colliding bodies if @xmath246 .",
    "if this condition is met , the total mass lost is :          if the collision does not disrupt the merged planetesimal , the mass in fragments is simply @xmath38 from ( a6 ) . to estimate the fraction of this mass that escapes , we follow the davis ( 1985 ) derivation of @xmath143 and integrate the mass distribution over velocity :                with these definitions , collisions with @xmath253 produce mergers and debris ; collisions with @xmath254 produce debris but no merger .",
    "we assume that rebounds conserve energy and that the velocity difference between bodies after the collision is        in addition to the tests described in section 2 , we repeat the collisional evolution of kbos described in davis & farinella ( 1997 ) . with suitable modifications to our algorithms for the collision cross - section and velocity evolution ,",
    "we reproduce their results to @xmath19 10%20% .",
    "our procedure for treating the evolution of the horizontal @xmath100 and vertical @xmath101 components of the velocity dispersion follows the kinetic formalism developed by hornung ( 1985 ) and barge & pellat ( 1990 , 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "in kl98 , we adopted the ws93 expressions for dynamical friction and viscous stirring due to long range encounters and reformulated the barge & pellat ( 1990 , 1991 ) expressions for inelastic collisions in terms of @xmath129 and @xmath256 ( see equations a19a22 of kl98 ) .",
    "we verified that our algorithm for computing the velocity evolution achieved the equilibrium value for the ratio of the vertical to the horizontal velocity @xmath257 = 0.6 ( @xcite ) and generally reproduced the velocity evolution of the ws93 earth calculation .    in this paper ,",
    "we make two modifications to our treatment of the velocity evolution and clarify our treatment of velocity evolution at low velocities .",
    "we assume that rebound collisions do not contribute to dynamical friction and viscous stirring for inelastic collisions ( equations a21 and a22 of kl98 ) . with this assumption",
    ", the orbits of low mass objects do not circularize when their velocity dispersion exceeds the rebound velocity ( equation a17 above ) .",
    "this behavior slows down the growth time of massive objects , because the collision cross - section remains in the high velocity limit .",
    "although the kinetic prescription of hornung ( 1985 ) accurately represents dynamical evolution at high particle velocities , it fails as the particle velocity approaches the hill velocity @xmath258 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ws93 ) .",
    "ida ( 1990 ) used @xmath207-body calculations to derive the appropriate behavior at low particle velocities , @xmath259 25 @xmath260 .",
    "we generally reproduce ida s ( 1990 ) results if we adopt          for dynamical friction ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . in both equations , the ` hv '",
    "subscript indicates the appropriate high velocity expression from kl98 ( equations a19 and a20 ) and @xmath263 is the value of @xmath264 at @xmath265 .",
    "these equations yield constant timescales for dynamical friction and the inclination component of viscous stirring ( @xcite ; figure 10 ) .",
    "the timescale for the eccentricity component of viscous stirring varies as @xmath266 at low velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we describe the sensitivity of the velocity evolution to the choice of @xmath69 in sec .",
    "2 . any @xmath267 2 slows down velocity evolution significantly , because the most massive particles in our test calculations have @xmath268 0.30.5 @xmath260 .",
    "the velocity changes are then @xmath19 25 times smaller for viscous stirring and @xmath19 500 times smaller for dynamical friction ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". our results are not very sensitive to @xmath69 for @xmath269 : the velocity evolution slows down gradually as @xmath69 increases from 2 to 5 ( see sec .",
    "we adopt the middle of ida s ( 1990 ) range , @xmath69 = 3.5 , in our kuiper belt calculations . for comparison ,",
    "ws93 adopt @xmath69 = 2 ; @xcite adopt @xmath69 = 0.8 for viscous stirring and @xmath69 = 2.6 for dynamical friction .    in many of our kuiper belt calculations ,",
    "the velocity of the largest bodies approaches zero due to collisional damping , dynamical friction , and fragmentation . to avoid divergences in the stirring rates from long - range encounters ,",
    "we adopt a minimum horizontal velocity of @xmath104 m s@xmath8 and a minimum vertical velocity of @xmath270 m s@xmath8 .",
    "this ` floor ' to the velocity evolution maintains the appropriate @xmath271 for collisions with @xmath272 and allows larger time steps for the brief interval when growth is rapid and the viscous stirring rate is small .",
    "tests show that the growth rate of the largest bodies does not depend on the values for these limits .",
    "lower values for the ` floor ' result in somewhat higher velocities for the small mass objects , but these changes are small .",
    "once viscous stirring begins to dominate collisional cooling , the velocities of all bodies increase above our ` floor ' values .    finally , to reduce the computation time of our velocity evolution algorithm , we approximate the @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 integrals in equations a19a22 of kl98 with polynomial expressions derived using _ mathematica _ 1988 - 1997 wolfram research , inc . ]",
    "our results match the integral expressions to better than 1 part in @xmath276 for @xmath271 = 01 .",
