    "detailed knowledge of dust and its effect on the total bolometric luminosity of galaxies is essential for an unbiased study of the evolution of galaxies . for example , dust is often associated with star formation activity and , hence , any measurement of this requires correction for dust extinction @xcite . furthermore ,",

    "while the fir / mm spectral range is sensitive to the cold dust component ( t@xmath11100k ) mostly found in the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) , the hot dust ( t@xmath125001500k ) component , mostly emitting at @xmath1218@xmath1 m , is nearer to the heating source , thus being the front - line medium to absorb direct uv / optical light and trace the most active regions in galaxies .    here , we perform a statistical study of the contribution of hot - dust and 3.3@xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature to the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of different populations of galaxies and their evolution with redshift .",

    "the second completeness magnitude cut ( lower panels in figure  [ fig : magcut ] ) considers rest - frame 1.6@xmath1 m absolute magnitudes ( assumed to be dominated by stellar light alone ) and takes into account the fact that it is not always possible to simultaneously trace the rest - frame 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m for one galaxy .",

    ", one can only estimate an upper limit of the @xmath56 agn by considering all sources inside the ki region to be agn ( they can also be @xmath57 starbursts ) .",
    "this yields a 32% rejection of the ki population when applying the @xmath49 cut . as the redshift of the faint ki - selected sources is unknown ,",
    "we add in quadrature a 0.32 factor to the error budget while estimating agn source densities ( see below ) .",
    "this is a conservative value given not all ki sources with @xmath56 are agn at @xmath26 .",
    "when computing measurement - associated errors , we consider in quadrature poisson and @xmath58-induced errors ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ) , and a factor ( @xmath61 ) to account for photometric redshift outliers ( we adopt a conservative value of @xmath62 , i09 and appendix  [ sec : zphagn ] ) . in the case of the agn sample ,",
    "an additional factor ( @xmath63 ) , accounting for the agn with @xmath56 , ought to be considered .",
    "for instance , the error associated to source density for the agn sample is : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 represents the source density .",
    "we note that the reference irac photometry used to select our sample was measured using an aperture of 1@xmath669 and then scaled to total flux using a correction factor assuming a point source .",
    "however , such assumption is not always verified especially at low redshifts . at such distances ,",
    "the physical size traced by a 1@xmath669 aperture is small ( @xmath67kpc , table  [ tab : zrange ] ) , thus probing only the central region of a galaxy .",
    "hence , we apply a statistical correction to the four irac bands depending on redshift and spectral - type ( only for non - agn populations ) by comparing with the 4@xmath661 aperture ( ap4 ) photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : photcorr ] shows the magnitude difference between the two apertures versus the 1@xmath669 aperture ( ap2 ) magnitude .",
    "each panel refers to different redshift bins where the rest - frame 3.3@xmath1 m is traced by the irac bands .",
    "note , however , that the corrections are applied to all irac bands at each redshift bin and are different between bands .",
    "the discordance between the two apertures results from three factors : ( _ i _ ) flux being missed by the ap2 photometry ( shifting the whole distribution up ) ; ( _ ii _ ) contamination by neighboring sources ( producing the scatter to positive y - axis values ) ; ( _ iii _ ) and bright nearby sources affecting the background measurement , which produces a flux underestimate at large apertures ( producing the scatter to negative y - axis values ) .",
    "the correction aims at compensating for missing flux ( _ i _ ) , while being independent of artifacts ( _ ii _ and _ iii _ ) .",
    "only sources with @xmath68ab are considered , so that the correction value is unaffected by the large scatter at fainter magnitudes .",
    "it is clear that the lower the redshift , the larger is the correction .",
    "we finally refer that the agn sample is not corrected for this effect , as the emission from agn sources is assumed to come from the nuclear region , thus not being affected by aperture photometry .",
    "star - formation in the host - galaxy could in principle still produce such bias .",
    "however , we do not observe strong evidence for such a scenario in our ir - selected agn sample ( see section  [ sec : d2 t ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : rfwl ] we have mentioned the two rest - frame bands where hot - dust and pah emission is expected : 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m . however , at these wavelengths , one also needs to take into account stellar emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : cont33 ] shows the estimated 1.6@xmath1 m luminosities versus the observed  hence including both stellar plus non - stellar emission  3.3@xmath1 m ( left hand - side plot ) and 4.2@xmath1 m ( right hand - side plot ) luminosities for each galaxy population considered in this study .",
    "the observe fluxes include both stellar and non - stellar emission .",
    "the regions between the dotted lines represent the locus where the seds dominated by stellar emission alone are expected to fall ( see below ) .",
    "the elliptical data `` cloud '' tends to fall in this `` stellar region '' .",
    "any deviation from this region , clear in starburst and agn populations , is assigned to non - stellar emission ( hot - dust and pah ) .",
    "this is the emission excess we aim to extract .    in order to disentangle stellar from non - stellar emission",
    ", we first estimate the stellar emission at 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m for each galaxy .",
    "this is done in two steps .",
    "first we consider a reference wavelength where the observed flux is expected to come entirely from stellar emission . using this , we then estimate the stellar emission at 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m . the remaining flux is thus assumed to be due to contribution from non - stellar emission alone .    the reference wavelength used to estimate",
    "the stellar emission is the stellar bump at rest - frame 1.6@xmath1 m ( @xmath69-band ) .",
    "this emission bump is frequently observed in galaxy seds ( figure  [ fig : ellmod ] ) , being indicative of pure stellar contribution , as at @xmath70 m no significant dust emission is expected .",
    "this is because uv / optical ( stellar or agn ) emission is not enough to heat dust at the level for its cooling emission to dominate at such short wavelengths , or because any dust particle or pah molecule in a strong radiation field is dissociated .",
    "hence , at wavelengths below @xmath71 m , only emission from the wien tail of the spectrum due to the hottest dust grains ( e.g. , around thermally pulsating agb , tp - agb , stars or in a dust torus around an agn ) and from scattered agn light is expected .",
    "such emission can still be significant enough at 1.6@xmath1 m to induce a systematic overestimate of the stellar emission , and consequently underestimate the non - stellar contribution . at this stage",
    ", we avoid quantifying such bias either for individual galaxies or for the statistically large sample used here .",
    "the flux at rest - frame 1.6@xmath1 m is obtained through interpolation between the two wavebands which straddle this rest - frame wavelength at the source s redshift .",
    "however , interpolation is likely to underestimate the true rest - frame 1.6@xmath1 m flux value depending on the source redshift and sed shape .",
    "this is evident from figure  [ fig : interpol ] where discrepancies between estimated and true value ( always below the 20% level ) are shown for typical early ( red ) and late ( green ) galaxies , blue starbursts ( blue ) , and agn hosts ( magenta ) .",
    "these trends were used to correct the interpolated 1.6@xmath1 m flux for each galaxy at its respective redshift . due to the absence of the @xmath69-band from the i09 catalogue , at @xmath72 the ratio in figure  [ fig : interpol ] is @xmath73 , because @xmath74 and @xmath14 passbands were used to interpolate the 1.6@xmath1 m flux .",
    "the final corrected values are the ones shown in figure  [ fig : cont33 ] .    with the estimated stellar flux at 1.6@xmath1 m , the corresponding stellar contribution at 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m is obtained .",
    "this is done with a pure stellar model ( solid line in figure  [ fig : ellmod ] , corresponding to a 2gyr old elliptical from @xcite ) , the same used in figure  [ fig : cont33 ] to compute the stellar - dominated locus .",
    "the conversion from 1.6@xmath1 m stellar flux to that at 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m is slightly redshift dependent , because the considered filters will probe slightly different rest - frame wavelength ranges .",
    "hence , using the pure stellar model ( figure  [ fig : ellmod ] ) , a conversion table was generated by convolving that stellar model with the nir filters ( from @xmath74-band to 8@xmath1 m ) at redshift steps of @xmath75 .",
    "we consider the underlying shape of the galaxy sed at 1.64.2@xmath1 m , due to stellar emission alone , to be common to all galaxy populations referred in this study .",
    "this is a fair assumption for a universal initial mass function .",
    "the stellar emission in this spectral regime originates in cold stars , which live longer , thus producing a constant sed shape over a wide range of ages .",
    "such assumption may be affected by strong differential obscuration affecting the rest - frames 1.6@xmath1 m and 3.3 or 4.2@xmath1 m . however",
    ", this will only occur in extremely obscured systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are rare .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellmod ] supports this assumption , showing how similar the 1.64.2@xmath1 m stellar sed is between a 13gyr old elliptical and a 0.05gyr old starburst ( models from i09 ) .",
    "the next step is to separate the hot - dust emission from the pah emission at 3.3@xmath1 m . in order to do this ,",
    "we use the results from @xcite who find that a gray - body model of temperature 850k and with a dust emissivity index of 1 is optimal to fit galaxies continuum emission in the 35@xmath1 m spectral range . assuming this continuum shape",
    ", we normalize it to the 4.2@xmath1 m dust emission flux to estimate the flux at 3.3@xmath1 m . removing this from the total non - stellar 3.3@xmath1 m emission , one estimates the pah 3.3@xmath1 m emission flux .",
    "this procedure is only applied to non - agn sources , given that @xcite only considered non - agn sources . in the case of agn ,",
    "a dominant power - law continuum shape is more likely .",
    "hence , we estimate the 3.3@xmath1 m continuum emission in agn via interpolation of the two bands straddling the band tracing rest - frame 3.3@xmath1 m , assuming @xmath76 .",
    "henceforth , whenever `` pah emission '' is mentioned , we refer to the 3.3@xmath1 m pah emission flux estimated by the above procedure , while whenever `` hot - dust emission '' is mentioned , we refer to the estimated 4.2@xmath1 m non - stellar emission flux assigned to hot - dust emission alone .",
    "figure  [ fig : d2 t ] presents the evolution of the average dust - to - total ( left hand - side ) and pah - to - total ( right hand - side ) luminosity ratios .",
    "it is clear that the average contribution of hot - dust at 4.2@xmath1 m ir - selected agn remains constant with redshift around the 80% level .",
    "this constancy results from using ir agn selection criteria alone .",
    "the goal here is to independently trace different dust - heating mechanisms ( agn activity versus star - formation ) .",
    "note also the extremely low pah contribution in agn , consistent with pah - annihilation by the agn radiation or emission - dilution in the bright agn - dominated sed .",
    "the increase at the lowest redshift interval for the agn population may be explained by the aperture photometry adopted to estimate colors .",
    "with decreasing redshift , a fixed aperture will probe more nuclear regions , enabling the detection of lower luminosity agn .",
    "being less powerful , these agn allow for the existence of pah molecules as opposed to more luminous agn , the dominant population with increasing redshifts , which shows average pah - to - total luminosity ratios close to zero .",
    "while the dust - to - total luminosity ratio for early - type galaxies is consistent within @xmath77 to be constant ( @xmath78 ) with redshift , it increases with increasing redshift for late - type and starburst galaxies .",
    "the starburst and early - type populations present a constant pah - to - total luminosity ratio ( within the errors ) with redshift , while the late - type population shows a decrease at the lowest redshift interval .",
    "the pah - to - dust luminosity ratio seems to vary slightly .",
    "for instance , the ratio for the starburst sample is @xmath79 at @xmath28 , @xmath80 at @xmath31 , and @xmath81 @xmath33 . in the literature ,",
    "the 3.3-pah feature strength is compared to colder - dust ( emitting at 81000@xmath1 m ) instead , and there is no evidence for evolution : @xcite estimate for a sample at @xmath82 an average 3.3-pah to 81000@xmath1 m luminosity ratio of @xmath83 , while @xcite find the ratio to be @xmath84 in a @xmath85 source ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , being both values in agreement with those found for lower - redshift starburst galaxies @xcite",
    ".    the fact that we find an increase of the average dust - to - total luminosity ratio with redshift does not necessarily mean the sample is progressively incomplete at higher redshifts ( i.e. , missing pure stellar emission sources , @xmath86 ) . figure  [ fig : d2tlum ] ( bottom panel in left hand - side plot ) shows that higher redshift galaxies are indeed dustier in the luminosity range where all samples are complete .",
    "however , below the luminosity completeness cuts ( section  [ sec : sampsel ] ) , one can not assess the trends for the high-@xmath47 intervals .",
    "the decrease in the number of galaxies showing no dust emission ( @xmath86 ) with decreasing 1.6@xmath1 m luminosity is likely to be real ( top panel in left hand - side plot ) , as the slope of the relation is constant up to the brightest luminosities .",

    "is based on the flux limit of the sample and the @xmath87-correction , derived from the galaxy s own sed ( as given by the observed multi - wavelength photometry ) , and obtained through the @xmath88 method @xcite .",
    "the dust ldfs enable us to evaluate how much dust is contributing to the ir radiation at any given luminosity and redshift for each galaxy population .",
    "note that 1.6@xmath1 m luminosities can be taken as a proxy to stellar mass assuming 1.6@xmath1 m to be dominated by stellar emission .",
    "therefore , one could assume here , as a proxy , the dust contribution as a function of galaxy stellar mass . also , using a common luminosity discriminator , allows for a direct comparison between the dust and pah ldfs .",
    "although agn hosts are rare ( @xmath89 in our sample ) , this population clearly dominates the bright - end of the dust ldfs at least at @xmath90 .",
    "the opposite is seen in the pah ldfs , where the agn population is the weakest contributor at all redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf33dz ] shows evidence for a number - density evolution in dust ldfs for agn . if one assumes the dust - to - total luminosity ratio to be constant in ir - selected agn ( figure  [ fig : d2 t ] ) , then one would not expect to see any evolution with redshift at fixed luminosities in the dust luminosity density ( @xmath91 ) assuming a constant number - density . however , this seems to be the case , especially from @xmath33 to @xmath31",
    ". further confirmation of this result may be accomplished by extending this study to deep irac coverages available , e.g. , in the goods fields .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lf33dz ] , the major evolution in @xmath91 and pah luminosity density ( @xmath92 ) for the non - agn populations mainly appears at the highest luminosities .",
    "that is , the most massive galaxies present the strongest evolution with redshift in both @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    regarding the pah ldfs in figure  [ fig : lf33d ] ,",
    "the faint - end is always dominated by the starburst population , followed by the late - type , and then the early - type galaxies . at high luminosities ,",
    "the three non - agn populations seem to contribute at comparable rates .",
    "this , however , does not happen in the dust ldfs , where the early - type population is the weakest contributor , while late - type and starburst populations have the highest contribution .",
    "this is explained in figure  [ fig : d2 t ] , which shows that the higher the redshift , the larger is the difference in dust - to - total luminosity ratio between the early - type galaxies and late - type or starburst galaxies , while this is not the case for the pah - to - total luminosity ratios .",
    "the reason why this happens is not straightforward , but assuming the gray - body model scaling should instead more - or - less correlate to 3.3-pah strength , one can conclude the following scenarios : ( i ) extra flux in early - type galaxies at 3.3@xmath1 m unaccounted by pah emission ; ( ii ) or extra emission at 4.2@xmath1 m in starburst and late - type galaxies .",
    "the former could imply higher gray - body temperatures ( @xmath93850k ) in early - types , for instance , induced by low - luminosity agn , which were missed by the adopted agn selection , while ( ii ) could be explained by @xcite , who show evidence for extra emission in the 25@xmath1 m spectral range unaccounted by the same gray - body model we assume plus pah emission .",
    "they also find that this extra emission correlates with star - formation @xcite , thus explaining why we observe the enhancement in starburst and late - type galaxies and not in early - types .",
    "this reasoning also implies that the extra - emission heating mechanisms are in part different from those of the 3.3-pah feature .",
    "one source of extra - emission at @xmath94 could be the br@xmath95 emission line ( 4.05@xmath1 m ) .",
    "if present , it would imply an underestimate of the 3.3-pah flux .",
    "however , the star - forming sample gathered by @xcite shows that the luminosity ratio between br@xmath95 and 3.3-pah feature is @xmath96 , which is not enough to account for the difference pointed out in figure  [ fig : lf33d ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : zlum ] , we present the evolution of @xmath91 and @xmath92 since @xmath971 ( left and right hand - side , respectively ) .",
    "we also compare @xmath91 to the cold - dust luminosity density estimated from fir observations ( 70500@xmath1 m , dark gray shaded region , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , linearly translated to obscured star - formation . however , comparing the luminosity density at present time to that at @xmath33 , the drop in @xmath91 is more significant than that of the cold - dust luminosity density , by @xmath98dex .    such decrease is driven mostly by the non - starburst populations .",
    "while one may attribute part of the decay to the strong evolution shown by agn hosts , whose fir sed is related to star - formation and not to agn activity , the late - type population also plays a role shaping such difference between hot and cold @xmath91 evolution .",
    "however , even the starburst population shows a different rate of evolution compared to that of the far - ir evolution : the drop in @xmath91 is still greater by @xmath99dex compared to that of cold - dust .",
    "we recall that the faint population , gradually missed with increasing redshifts by our completeness cuts , is likely a significant contributor to the overall @xmath91 and @xmath92 given the higher hot - dust and pah contribution observed in their seds ( figure  [ fig : d2tlum ] ) .",
    "this implies that the discrepancy between the hot and cold dust regimes is likely larger .",
    "also , figure  [ fig : lf33dz ] shows a slower evolution in @xmath91 and @xmath92 at fainter luminosities . accepting this as true",
    ", one can then consider the faint - end shape of the ldfs ( i.e. , that below the completeness cut ) is unchanged from a redshift interval to a subsequent lower one and estimate a completeness correction .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] for the total and starburst populations . integrating a given ldf at luminosities fainter than the completeness cut will thus provide an estimate of the extra @xmath65 missed by our sample . applying this correction yields extra luminosity density represented as the empty regions shown in figure  [ fig : zlum ] ( only for the total and non - agn populations ) .",
    "these corrections are expected to provide upper - limits for the @xmath65 values .",
    "recent work on the 3.3@xmath1 m pah feature with _",
    "spitzer _ and _ akari _ out to @xmath100 does not show an evolution with redshift of the luminosity ratio @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "however , comparing with hot - dust , our study seems to support slight variation of the hot - dust - to - pah luminosity ratio with redshift .",
    "@xcite find evidence for the stellar nurseries ( birth clouds ) to be producing a higher fraction of obscuration than the diffuse inter - stellar medium at high - redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : zlum ] corroborates such finding when comparing our results with the cold - dust luminosity density evolution .",
    "this explains why high - redshift star - forming galaxies are more obscured @xcite , as also pointed out by @xcite .    some interpretations for this discrepancy between hot and cold - dust evolution",
    "may then be given : either the reduced star - formation at low redshifts is unable to heat enough quantities of dust for it to dominate at 3.34.2@xmath1 m , thus becoming diluted in the much brighter stellar flux ; or dust may be , with decreasing redshift , gradually farther from uv / optical sources ( e.g. , blown by strong radiation fields from an active nucleus or stellar winds ) , thus decreasing the relative contribution of the hottest spectral dust - components ; or , in the case of the agn population , different evolution of the heating mechanisms at play  agn activity dominating the hot - dust regime versus star - formation dominating the cold - dust regime  in agn hosts .",
    "table  [ tab : fracld ] shows , for each redshift interval , the contributions of each of the galaxy populations to the overall dust luminosity density at rest - frames 3.3 and 4.2@xmath1 m .",
    "these values refer to contributions down to the adopted luminosity completeness cut .",
    "ccrrrr dust & @xmath28 & 2 & 23 & 72 & 3 + & @xmath31 & 6 & 28 & 47 & 19 + & @xmath33 & 3 & 19 & 45 & 33 +   + pah & @xmath28 & 6 & 18 & 76 & 0 + & @xmath31 & 12 & 35 & 53 & 0 + & @xmath33 & 15 & 28 & 56 & 1",
    "in this work , the properties of hot dust ( @xmath12690k ) emission was explored using observations tracing rest - frame 4.2@xmath1 m .",
    "this wavelength is also used to infer the dust contribution at rest - frame 3.3@xmath1 m , and help assessing 3.3-pah strength .",
    "our approach considers stellar , dust , and pah emissions separately , as well as the separation of the ir galaxy population into early , late , starburst , and ir - selected agn .",
    "this allows the evaluation of the ir luminosity functions depending on galaxy - type and distance , as well as to estimate how much dust is contributing to the ir emission .",
    "we conclude :    * evolution with redshift of the hot - dust luminosity densities resembles that of cold - dust , but it drops more steeply ( at least 0.5dex more ) with decreasing redshift .",
    "the discrepancy is larger if one attempts to correct for sample incompleteness .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is probably a combination of : with decreasing redshift , the star - formation becomes gradually unable to heat dust to such high temperatures for it to significantly contribute to the galaxy sed at such short wavelengths ; dust is gradually located at increasingly larger distances from the heating sources ( stars or active nuclei ) ; and/or distinct evolution of different heating mechanisms at play in agn hosts .",
    "this trend gives support to the scenario where galaxy obscuration increases with redshift , as already proposed in the literature ( section  [ sec : ldz ] ) .",
    "* while the average dust - to - total luminosity ratio is observed to increase with redshift , the average pah - to - total luminosity ratio is consistent with being constant .",
    "the hot - dust - to - pah luminosity ratio also depends on galaxy spectral type .",
    "a plausible explanation may be related to the findings of @xcite , who observe increased extra emission at 25@xmath1 m with increasing star - formation rates ( section  [ sec : dlfs ] ) .",
    "* hot - dust and pah ldfs of the non - agn populations show that the hot - dust and pah emission in the most luminous galaxies at 1.6@xmath1 m ( i.e. , the most massive ) decreases faster ( with decreasing redshift ) than in less luminous galaxies ( section  [ sec : dlfs ] ) . *",
    "down to our luminosity limit , the agn population comprises only @xmath6 of the total galaxy population at @xmath102 , but its contribution to the overall hot - dust luminosity density increases from 3% at @xmath103 to 33% at @xmath104 , and it clearly dominates the bright - end of the total hot - dust ldfs at @xmath104 ( section  [ sec : dlfs ] ) .",
    "the main driver for this is the high dust - to - total luminosity ratio at rest - frame 4.2@xmath1 m found in ir - selected agn : @xmath120.8 ( section  [ sec : d2 t ] ) .",

    "a there are 18 sources with spectroscopy , all but three fall at @xmath125 ( only one at @xmath126 ) .",
    "the x - ray detection rate ( 58 sources among 1724 ) is rather low for a @xmath127 agn population , but acceptable for a higher redshift population including both agn and non - agn sources .",

    "in fact , considering s11 redshift estimates ( @xmath128 ) for the 58 x - ray detected sources , only two of them fall at @xmath7 . these evidences support the scenario where sample a is mostly composed by @xmath129 sources , and we thus assign the photometric redshifts from i09 to sources in sample a. we note however , that 37 of these sources ( 64% ) do require agn - like templates ( s11 ) . the difference between @xmath128 and @xmath111 is likely not just due to variability ( about 30% of those sources are non - variable , i.e. , variability below 0.25 ; s11 ) , but rather a result from not considering luminosity priors ( as used in s11 ) when computing @xmath111 .",
    "in sample b ( selected as sources with @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 ) we do not find such a clear trend , with both spectroscopic measurements and @xmath128 estimates showing equal evidence for a sample composed by sources at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "<S> this study is performed for different spectral types of galaxies : early - type , late - type , starburst , and ir - selected active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that : ( a ) the decrease of the hot - dust luminosity density since @xmath5 is steeper ( by at least 0.5dex ) compared to that of the cold - dust , giving support to the scenario where galaxy obscuration increases with redshift , as already proposed in the literature ; ( b ) hot - dust and pah emission evolution seems to be correlated with stellar mass , where rest - frame 1.6@xmath1 m luminous non - agn galaxies ( i.e. , massive systems ) show a stronger decrement ( with decreasing redshift ) in hot - dust and pah emission than the less luminous ( less massive ) non - agn galaxies ; ( c ) despite comprising @xmath6 of the total sample , agn contribute as much as a third to the hot - dust luminosity density at @xmath7 and clearly dominate the bright - end of the total hot - dust luminosity density function at @xmath8 ; ( d ) the average dust - to - total luminosity ratio increases with redshift , while pah - to - total luminosity ratio remains fairly constant ; ( e ) at @xmath9 , the dust - to - total and pah - to - total luminosity ratios increase with decreasing luminosity , but deeper data is required to confirm this result . </S>",
    "<S> future study is necessary to enlighten further the characterization of the different spectral components at play in 25@xmath1 m spectral regime . </S>"
