    "physical properties of single and multilayered graphene are remarkable and open interesting avenues for applications in the future.@xcite however , to realize its potential it is important to fully understand the elastic properties of graphene layers,@xcite the effect of external stresses on electronic properties@xcite , or conversely the effect of doping on mechanical properties,@xcite and the appearance of ripplings,@xcite corrugations , and other defects expected under actual conditions of cleanness , temperature , and growth .",
    "the understanding of any departure from the perfect 2d configuration ( e.g. , rippling and corrugation ) of very thin graphene layers , either in free suspension or deposited on a template substrate , is central for manufacturing processes.@xcite at t= 0 k , in the absence of defects , the carbon bond on the graphene layer is well understood in terms of the formation of three in - plane localized strong sp@xmath0 bonds , and a fourth delocalized , out - of - plane , @xmath1-like bond.@xcite the optimum geometrical configuration is achieved by a honeycomb lattice formed by two equivalent sublattices displaying p6/mmm symmetry .",
    "the corresponding electronic structure shows bands dispersing linearly around the fermi energy that are responsible for the fast and efficient transport of carriers .",
    "both experimentally and theoretically,@xcite it is shown that this kind of arrangement results in a material with the largest in - plane elastic constants known yet . therefore the 2d perfect flat layer makes the most stable configuration since deviations from a common plane requires a significant amount of energy .",
    "any departure from such a scenario affects greatly the atomic scale properties of the layer and must be understood in order to efficiently exploit graphene s properties .",
    "different reasons , however , might be invoked for a two - dimensional graphene layer to adopt a certain corrugation at different scales .",
    "first , at a non - zero temperature there is a thermodynamic argument that implies the impossibility for a perfect 2d layer to exist in 3d.@xcite second , defects like adsorbed impurities , vacancies , etc , create local corrugations at the atomic scale@xcite that propagate via the elastic properties of the lattice originating long - range correlations . finally , external applied stresses related to conditions on the boundary make graphene to bend and to corrugate ; an interesting point to study since the growth of graphene layers on different supporting substrates implies mismatches that introduce all kind of stresses that have been observed to originate a highly complex and corrugated landscape.@xcite research on these issues require atomically resolved techniques ; theoretical simulations performed with _",
    "ab - initio _ density functional theory ( dft)@xcite give an accurate picture of the interatomic interactions and can provide valuable information about geometry , vibrations , electronic effects , etc , down to the atomic level . indeed , _",
    "ab - initio _ dft has been successfully applied for many years now to describe the different allotropes of carbon , like graphite , diamond , fullerenes , organic molecules , nanotubes , etc ( e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here , we focus on the role of external stresses on the flexural modes ultimately responsible for the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of these layers",
    ". the frequencies of these modes are very sensitive to external compressive stresses and can be related , in turn , to the grneisen coefficients and the thermal expansion coefficient of graphene.@xcite the purpose of this paper is to use state - of - the - art _ ab - initio _ dft to compare atomic corrugations on graphene layers related to three different origins : ( i ) the presence of small adsorbed impurities ( hydrogen ) , ( ii ) thermal vibrational amplitudes ( t=300 k ) , and ( iii ) the long wavelength corrugation characteristic of flexural modes .",
    "we analyze the consequences of an isotropic compressive stress on these corrugations , the elastic constants and the phonons .",
    "since we are interested in elastic and vibrational properties we use accurate norm - conserving pseudopotentials to describe carbon valence band electrons ( 2s@xmath0 2p@xmath0).@xcite electronic wavefunctions have been expanded in a plane - wave basis set up to an energy cutoff of @xmath2ev , and a @xmath3 monkhorst - pack mesh has been used to sample wavefunctions inside the first brillouin zone .",
    "electronic bands were obtained using a smearing width of @xmath4ev .",
    "the choice of the exchange and correlation ( xc ) potential opens up various possibilities .",
    "we favor the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite because of its simplicity , excellent structural results for a wide range of carbon allotropes relevant for this work , and in particular because , even if somehow fortuitous , it predicts a reasonable value for the layer separation in graphite .",
    "lda presents a solid record reproducing many key features for a wide variety of carbonaceous materials , and it has been a standard choice in the literature for many authors .",
    "unfortunately , the use of lda can not be justified `` a priori '' on physical grounds by merely referring to the behavior of the next term on a gradients expansion ( gga ) ; different flavors of gga yield worse agreement with experiments ( e.g. for the distance between planes in graphite ) showing that the converge on such an expansion is not a trivial one .",
    "therefore , we are forced to justify the use of lda on the `` a posteriori '' reasonable structural results .",
    "its simpler formulation should also be taken as an advantage , since makes a better defined and more unique formulation .",
    "finally , it is known that lda may not be too accurate for absolute values of total energies , but it affords a good description of relative values ( e.g. , barriers ) , and it yields the correct dependence with stress after a single common offset correction.@xcite a periodic supercell with a vacuum gap in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath5  ) and several @xmath6 in - plane periodicities ( @xmath7 ) depending on the requirements of each model have been used .",
    "geometrical parameters have been optimized so residual maximum forces and stresses have been kept below @xmath8 ev /  , and @xmath9 gpa for the calculation of phonons and elastic constants , yielding a lattice parameter for the rhombohedral unit cell on a single graphene layer of @xmath10  ( fig .",
    "[ fgr : ucbz ] ) , and @xmath11  for graphite ( bernal stacking ) .",
    "calculations were performed with the castep code , as implemented in materials studio.@xcite the elastic tensor has been obtained by applying a series of strains on the @xmath12 unit cell ( maximum amplitude @xmath13  ) , and by computing the associated stress tensors.@xcite phonons have been computed using linear response theory.@xcite as a global benchmark to the elements included in our calculations ( pseudopotential , exchange and correlation model , different convergence thresholds , etc ) , we compare in table i our theoretical results for the five independent components of the elastic tensor for graphite to experimental values measured on pyrolitic graphite by ultrasonic resonance,@xcite and on single crystals by inelastic x - ray scattering.@xcite a comparison to a recent independent theoretical determination has also been included.@xcite the agreement is quite reasonable , except perhaps for @xmath14 that can not be described properly with a local choice for exchange and correlation .",
    "we notice that the basal in - plane theoretical poisson ratio , @xmath15 , and the young modulus , @xmath16 ( tpa ) , are in good agreement with experimental values , @xmath17 and @xmath18 tpa respectively;@xcite as expected these are very similar for a graphene monolayer ( @xmath19 for theory to be compared with a quoted experimental value @xmath20@xcite ) .",
    "values for the 2d elastic constants of a single graphene layer ( i),@xcite the bilayer with the usual ab bernal stacking , and a bilayer with direct aa stacking ( distance between layers @xmath21  ) display little variation in the main elements of the elastic tensor ( table ii , for reference 2d tensions for graphite are quoted ) .",
    "the main departure has been found for the aa bilayer in the _ metastable _ configuration ( distance between layers @xmath22 );@xcite the reduction of c@xmath23 is related to the gradual transformation of the in - plane c - c bond order from sp@xmath0 towards sp@xmath24 , since the 2d unit cell needs to be expanded to make the structure metastable under its own pressure .",
    "the increase in c@xmath25 implies a larger tendency against shear due to substitution of the weak van der waals - like interaction between both layers by stronger sp@xmath24-like chemical bonds .",
    "for the two - dimensional graphene layer , due to its 6-fold symmetry , we only need to determine two independent values in the elastic tensor ; these can be related to the two lame coefficients needed to characterize an isotropic system ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "an independent determination of @xmath28 , that should be equal to @xmath29 , holds fairly well in all the cases . therefore , simple analytical models based in the theory of elasticity that only need values for these two parameters make a good approximation and can be thoroughly analyzed.@xcite under a moderate compressive stress ( e.g. @xmath30 ) the main change happens in the value of @xmath31 that is reduced by @xmath32 .    fig .",

    "the optimized structure shows a computed vibrational spectra that agree well with previous calculations in the literature,@xcite as can be seen by comparing frequencies for the modes at selected high - symmetry points ( table iii ) . for @xmath33 ( no external stress , black circles ) ,",
    "all the frequencies are positive and behave as expected ; it is interesting to observe how the lowest acoustic mode ( za ) disperses quadratically , a characteristic feature for a 2d system ( e.g. , see eq .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic instability of the layer against compressive strain is demonstrated by the appearance of negative frequencies in a small region around the g point ; the za phonon softens and goes to negative values.@xcite it is worth noticing that because the extreme asymmetry between compression and tension for strain induced instabilities on graphene layers we have only considered compressive strains.@xcite other failure mechanisms for graphene under tension have been studied elsewhere.@xcite for some critical wavevector , @xmath34 , the mode becomes again positive , and the value of @xmath35 increases with the amount of stress .",
    "the value of @xmath35 defines a characteristic wavelength , @xmath36 , with an amplitude that depends directly on the strain .",
    "this lowering of the frequency of the za modes under compression is consistent with the negative grneisen coefficients reported in the literature.@xcite a fit to the results in fig .",

    "these strains are large enough for the wavelength determined by the @xmath45 supercell .",
    "it has been previously shown by zhang and liu@xcite that wavelengths of periodic undulations scale inversely with the square root of strain , setting a minimum value for a given wavelength that it is @xmath46 for the @xmath45 , therefore compatible with the values we use here . for @xmath47 - 3%",

    "larger stresses drives the non - linear behavior of the system , for @xmath47 - 5% we find an energy gain of @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 , @xmath53  .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the density of states at the fermi level ( e.g. , the tersoff - haman stm image ) for such a long - range rippling of graphene is symmetric with respect to the two sublattices , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fgr : stm ] , where the density of states has been drawn on each c atom for @xmath54 v. corrugations of this kind are expected to evolve smoothly into long wavelength deformations in larger unit cells , unlike the case for thermal or defect induced corrugations we study below .      to quantitatively compare corrugations on graphene layers originated from other effects , we investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations ( @xmath55 k ) .",
    "the relationship between stresses originated in free finite edges and thermal fluctuations has already been reported in the literature.@xcite . in our simulations , based in periodic models , stresses due to free edges do not naturally occur , but it is interesting to notice how our uniform compressive strain of @xmath56 yields results comparable to those simulations . to introduce a finite temperature in our simulations we use ab - initio molecular dynamics to follow the trajectories of carbon atoms in a @xmath57 unit cell in equilibrium with a nose - hoover thermostat at @xmath58 k. starting out from an equilibrium distribution the graphene layer is allowed to evolve in the canonical ensemble for @xmath59 ps using a @xmath60 fs step to integrate the equations of motion . as before , the same two statistical indicators , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "are computed averaging over all the configurations reached inside the time interval @xmath63 ( the shape of the layer at a time chosen at random , @xmath64 fs , is shown in the upper panel of fig .",

    "table iii shows values for three strains on the unit cell : @xmath65 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the last two strains correspond to stresses of @xmath66 ev / @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ev / @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the case @xmath33 allows a double check by comparing with the experimental debye - waller factor determined from low - energy electron diffraction on graphite ( 0001):@xcite 0.053  to be compared with a value of 0.069  as derived from the simulation .",
    "even for the small strain values considered here , it is clear the non - linear growth of corrugations vs the external strain .",
    "a further source for corrugations at the atomic level is the presence of defects . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider the adsorption of a light element ( hydrogen atom ) , which is known to originate a static distortion in the lattice that depends on the coverage , @xmath69 , and extends as a long - range elastic perturbation.@xcite for @xmath70 , a value where the interaction between periodic images of the adsorbate is already low and can be representative of the behavior for the isolated impurity , both the averaged and the maximum corrugation take values fairly similar to the ones obtained by heating the layer to @xmath58 k , except perhaps for the value of @xmath62 , that systematically takes lower values for the thermal case ( table iii ) .",
    "the corrugations studied here lead to partial @xmath71 hybridization of the carbon orbitals , enhancing the spin - orbit coupling.@xcite",
    "we find that averaged atomic corrugations of @xmath72  , and maximum corrugation values of @xmath73  are easily obtained under realistic conditions of cleanness and temperature on graphene layers .",
    "corrugations due to thermal vibrations of atoms at room temperature make a similar effect to the adsorption of a light atom ( h ) with a moderately small coverage ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "an external compressive stress increases corrugations in a non - linear way . due to the flexural mode ,",
    "the graphene layer becomes intrinsically unstable and shows a value for the maximum corrugation under compressive stress three or four times larger than values attained at @xmath75 k or because the adsorption of impurities . upon a 4% contraction ,",
    "the lo and to modes increase their frequencies by about 20 % ; while the main elastic constant affected is @xmath31 , that is approximately halved.@xcite on the other hand , the frequencies of the za and zo modes are reduced .",
    "these modes induce an effective @xmath71 coordination in the lattice , and their softening under strain leads to an enhancement of the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling@xcite , opening a way to observe topological insulator features in graphene.@xcite finally , these simulations have been useful to obtain the elastic constants needed to construct an analytical model of free standing membranes based in elasticity theory.@xcite such a simple analytical model yields negative grneisen parameters related to the bending modes , and a simple explanation for the negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene .",
