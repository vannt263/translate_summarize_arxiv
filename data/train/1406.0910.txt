    "since the discovery of cuprate high - temperature superconductors , @xcite electronic properties of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system near the mott transition have attracted considerable attention , because the high - temperature superconductors are obtained by doping layered - structure mott insulators with holes or electrons .",
    "@xcite the anomalously high superconducting - transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) is considered to be related to the anomalous features near the mott transition in a 2d system .",
    "@xcite because both hole - doped and electron - doped systems exhibit superconductivity , @xcite it is natural to consider that the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity is included in both cases .",
    "thus , a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of hole - doped and electron - doped systems is desired in order to elucidate the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity .    a remarkable difference in spectral feature between hole - doped and electron - doped systems near the mott transition is the location of the pseudogap in the momentum space : the spectral weights around the fermi level are considerably reduced around @xmath1 and @xmath2 in hole - doped systems , @xcite whereas those around @xmath3 are almost lost in electron - doped systems .",
    "@xcite although this difference has been more or less reproduced in the 2d hubbard and @xmath4-@xmath5 models with next - nearest - neighbor hopping , the interpretations are controversial . @xcite for the pseudogap around @xmath3 in electron - doped systems , the most widely accepted interpretation would be that it can be identified as the gap due to the band splitting caused by antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "@xcite there are also other interpretations , such as that it is the result of short - range antiferromagnetic correlations , @xcite renormalization of the fermi surface by interactions , @xcite or zeros of the green function . @xcite    the purpose of this paper is to interpret the spectral features of hole - doped and electron - doped systems in a unified manner from the viewpoint of the mott transition .",
    "recently , the spectral features near the mott transition of the 2d hubbard model without next - nearest - neighbor hopping have been explained by tracing their origins back to the characteristic modes of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model .",
    "@xcite this paper further extends the argument to the case where next - nearest - neighbor hopping is included , by considering how the spectral weights are shifted by next - nearest - neighbor hopping near the mott transition , and shows that the nature of complicated spectral features in hole - doped and electron - doped systems can be intuitively understood by tracing their origins back to the properties of the 1d and 2d hubbard models without next - nearest - neighbor hopping .    based on this picture , various spectral features observed in hole - doped and electron - doped high-@xmath0 cuprates near the mott transition can be interpreted in a unified manner as properties of the 2d hubbard model whose spectral weights are shifted by next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "in particular , the different locations of the pseudogap between hole - doped and electron - doped systems @xcite and the disappearance of the spectral weights of the in - gap states toward the mott transition observed in both hole - doped and electron - doped cuprates @xcite are naturally explained from the viewpoint of the mott transition .",

    "@xcite      in this paper , cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite is employed to calculate @xmath22 . in cpt , the green function is obtained by connecting cluster green functions calculated by exact diagonalization through the first - order single - particle hopping process without assuming long - range order . in the non - interacting case ( @xmath41 ) , cpt becomes exact .",
