    "in this paper , we present a study of the small - time ( near - maturity ) asymptotics for the asset price density @xmath3 , the call and put prices , and the implied volatilities , for the class of continuous - time black - scholes - merton - type models with brownian noise and independent gaussian self - similar volatility .",
    "the techniques borrow from a framework established in our prior work @xcite for general gaussian volatility models ; they use a tailored application of laplace s method requiring a delicate analysis of uniformity with respect to strike prices @xmath4 away from the money ( @xmath5 ) , and apply a general result from @xcite to translate asymptotics from call prices to implied volaltilities .",
    "model - free estimators of the self - similarity parameter @xmath0 result .",
    "away from the money , all asymptotic constants and powers are expressed explicitly in terms of @xmath0 and of the coefficients in the karhunen - love expansion of the volatility . at the money ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "a separate study is required .",
    "this introduction contains extensive details of general context of the small - time asymptotic problems mentioned above , our motivations , and a precise summary of all our results .",
    "it has been known for decades that the bachelier - black - merton - scholes framework , while extraordinarily fertile for explaining various basic features of financial markets and for helping define fundamental notions , including volatility as the relative scale of noise intensity , suffers from certain deficiencies , particularly the fact that volatility is not constant empirically . when coupled with the fact that non - random volatility , which implies normally distributed log returns , has difficulties in explaining certain extreme events because of excessively light tails , one quickly arrives at the vast class of stochastic volatility models , i.e. those continuous - time models where the relative noise intensity of returns is itself a stochastic process which is at least partially driven by exogenous noise .",
    "a large number of articles and monographs on stochastic volatility ( sv ) can be consulted for empirical and economic justification of these models ; we cite the classical text @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is sv models ability to reproduce some desirable market features of option prices , such as smiles  and other non - flat shapes of the implied volatility ( iv ) , i.e. the volatility which would be required of a constant - volatility model to explain a given call option price .",
    "one of the first mathematical treatments explaining empirically observed iv shapes was by renault and touzi in @xcite .",
    "recent studies have looked in detail at the question of iv asymptotics , that is to say the behavior of iv as important parameters such as strike price @xmath4 and maturity @xmath7 tend to extreme values . of note",
    "is the groundbreaking paper @xcite of lee , in which the large - strike ( the small - strike ) behavior of iv is described in terms of the largest ( the smallest ) non - exploding moment of the stock price .",
    "gaussian volatility models belong to the class of models with moment explosions . for more details and other references on iv shapes and extreme - strike asymptotics of iv",
    ", we refer to the introduction section in our prior work @xcite , where we examine the class of uncorrelated gaussian volatility models in its broadest possible sense .",
    "small - time asymptotic behavior of densities , option pricing functions , and implied volatilities has been a popular topic of study .",
    "there are various model - independent results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , explaining how the asymptotics of the iv depend on those of option pricing functions .",
    "there are also papers discussing small - time asymptotics of the functions mentioned above in the case of stochastic volatility or local - stochastic volatility models ( see @xcite ) , and for special models ( see @xcite ( models with jumps ) , @xcite ( heston model ) , @xcite ( stein - stein model ) , @xcite ( sabr model ) ) .",
    "the present paper follows up on our prior study in @xcite by attempting to elucidate the small - time behavior of iv for a subclass of gaussian volatility models , consisting of models with self - similar volatility processes .",
    "it turns out that establishing small - time asymptotics in a general gaussian context is significantly more demanding than determining large - strike behavior .",
    "this can be understood as a manifestation of the fact that there is no model - free analogue of lee s moment formulas in the small or large time regimes . in this paper , we illustrate the challenge by specializing to the case of self - similar volatilities ; we will see that the type of small - time behavior for both call price and iv is quite sensitive to the self - similarity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this is good news if one is to leverage these results to help determine @xmath0 , as we will see .",
    "indeed , our study also allows us to investigate the question of long - memory sv calibration , since long - range dependence and self - similarity are proxies for each other in many known models , via their common hurst parameter @xmath0 . based on a gaussian long - memory model for log - volatility pioneered by comte and renault in @xcite , the work in @xcite used an ad - hoc calibration method based on option prices to determine @xmath0 so as to best explain market prices .",
    "fractional volatility models also appear in bfg , ccr , jg1,jg2,gjrrough , fz , fu1,fu , gjr , mor , r . in the current paper , we show that calibration of @xmath0 near maturity can be given a stronger mathematical foundation under self - similarity assumptions for the volatility process .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 can also be a proxy for local regularity measurements , in the sense of their paths hlder continuity parameter .",
    "some recent papers and presentations , yet unpublished at the time of writing this article , appear to show that volatility is rough , in the sense that the log - volatility process is fractional and it is not hlder continuous for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a positive number ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xcite and many studies before it",
    "( see references therein ) indicate that @xmath10 in terms of memory length .",
    "this is a demonstration that the use of @xmath0 to measure self - similarity _ and _ long memory _ and _ path regularity / roughness , such as in the case of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , might be a misspecification in volatility modeling .",
    "the authors of @xcite indicate that classical long - memory tests detect this property in their gaussian rough volatility model , which is a geometric fbm or a geometric ou process with shorter memory ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the studies in @xcite show on the other hand that no consistent memory estimation results in practice from any classical method when used on the non - self - similar stationary long - memory model of @xcite .",
    "our current work could help in elucidating the differences between these points of view ; we do not comment on them further herein .",
    "an interesting discussion of long memory vs short memory problem can be found in section 1.2 of @xcite . in any case , the numerics which we include in this paper and will discuss at the end of this introduction show that our model class allows for a very sharp calibration tool .    before providing a summary of our results ,",
    "we discuss some classical gaussian self - similar models .",
    "general details about this class are given in section [ s : dva ] .",
    "these are the gaussian processes @xmath12 on @xmath13 $ ] such that for some @xmath14 and for any @xmath15 , the two processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same distribution ( law ) .",
    "the best known among them is the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xmath18 , the centered gaussian process whose law is defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 = \\left\\vert t - s\\right\\vert ^{2h}$ ] .",
    "it is the only ( continuous ) self - similar centered gaussian process with stationary increments .",
    "many texts can be consulted on @xmath18 , including , e.g. , @xcite . among the many other centered gaussian self - similar models , which are all necessarily non - stationary ,",
    "the easiest to construct is the riemann - liouville fbm , defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a standard wiener process ( see for instance lim ) .",
    "this process , which is @xmath0-self - similar , has properties close to those of fbm , and can be more amenable to calculations .",
    "the so - called bifractional brownian motion depends on two similarity parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 , has a more complex representation , as the sum of an fbm with parameter @xmath23 , and a process with @xmath24 paths which is not adapted to a brownian filtration : see @xcite , see also @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this process , which is @xmath25-self - similar , can model the effect of smoothly acquired exogenous information , and is an extension of the so - called sub - fractional brownian motion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "self - similar gaussian processes can also be obtained as the solutions of stochastic partial differential equations : a class which includes solutions to fractional colored stochastic heat equations is studied in @xcite , which has the interesting property that its discrete quadratic variation has fluctuations which become non - gaussian at a threshold of self - similarity which is lower than for fbm , and can be adjusted to be as low as desired .",
    "this can be helpful to model volatilities whose local behavior has heavier - tailed fluctuations than what standard fbm can allow , regardless of the volatility s self - similarity .",
    "it also allows the modeler to choose regularity and self - similarity properties independently of each other , which offers more flexibility than the models considered in @xcite .",
    "more examples of gaussian self - similar process can be found in bgt , dm .",
    "interestingly , many of the gaussian self - similar models share the same path regularity properties as fbm , because it can be shown that there are positive finite constants @xmath26 for which @xmath27 < c\\left\\vert t - s\\right\\vert ^{2h}$ ] , where the symbol @xmath0 stands for the self - similarity parameter of the model under consideration .",
    "finally , it bears noting that self - similarity implies that @xmath28 and that @xmath29 $ ] is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "this is a strong assumption on @xmath12 .",
    "an uncertainty level on volatility which increases with time is a reasonable conservative forecasting assumption .",
    "that the volatilty starts at @xmath31 is more restrictive , since , in our iv context , it corresponds to saying that the underlying risky asset s movements tends towards certainty near the derivative s maturity .",
    "such a behavior is characteristic of specific risky asset classes , such as fixed - income securities , e.g. treasury bonds , and the dividend streams in preferred stocks ; it is atypical of common stocks . to soften the assumption that @xmath28",
    ", one can add a constant mean to each centered self - similar @xmath12 .",
    "we have investigated this possibility ; it appears that this will require additional non - trivial tools not contained herein .",
    "given the length of the current article , we have opted to leave this improvement for another work .",
    "one may , however , include a non - zero mean for each @xmath32 which is proportional to @xmath33 ; this is the framework used herein throughout .      in @xcite , we studied gaussian stochastic volatility models .",
    "the asset price process @xmath3 in such a model satisfies the following linear stochastic differential equation : @xmath34where @xmath12 is a continuous adapted gaussian process on a filtered complete probability space @xmath35 , @xmath22 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath36 with respect to the filtration @xmath37 , @xmath38 a.s . ,",
    "and @xmath39 is the risk - free interest rate .",
    "we will assume throughout the paper that the processes @xmath12 and @xmath22 are independent . in the model in ( [ e",
    ": svm ] ) , the volatility is described by the absolute value of a continuous gaussian process .",
    "an important special example of a gaussian stochastic volatility model is the stein - stein model introduced in @xcite , where @xmath12 in ( [ e : svm ] ) is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "if @xmath40 , the call option on @xmath3 with maturity @xmath7 and strike price @xmath4 has price @xmath41 ; this price equals a price @xmath42 in the black - scholes model with the volatility @xmath43 depending on @xmath7 and @xmath4 . that value of @xmath43 is called the _ implied volatility _ ( iv ) and is denoted by @xmath44 . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the behavior of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for small @xmath7 when @xmath4 is fixed ; consequently , we typically drop the dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 on @xmath4 .    of particular importance",
    "is the density @xmath47 of the _ integrated variance _ @xmath48 .",
    "the centered version of this @xmath49 is a random variable in the second chaos of a wiener space independent of @xmath22 .",
    "the covariance function of @xmath12 acts as a compact self - adjoint linear operator on @xmath50\\right ) $ ] , with non - zero eigenvalues @xmath51 arranged in non - increasing order with repeats for multiplicities .",
    "this , and the corresponding eigenfunctions , are the basis for the so - called karhunen - love ( kl ) decomposition of @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and of a corresponding one for @xmath52 . in any case , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 near @xmath53 , which was established in @xcite , depends on specific kl statistics , including the top eigenvalue @xmath54 , its multiplicity @xmath55 , and the rescaled @xmath50\\right ) $ ] -orthogonal projection @xmath56 of @xmath54 s eigenspace on the mean function of @xmath12 ( see theorem [ t : gella ] below ) .",
    "when applied to the case of @xmath0-self - similar @xmath57 , via the simple scaling formula @xmath58 , the behavior of @xmath59 at @xmath60 translates into an expansion around @xmath61 of the density @xmath62 of the rescaled square - rooted version of @xmath49 which is precise up to a factor @xmath63 for any fixed @xmath64 : see asymptotic formula ( [ e : finnys ] ) in theorem [ t : mixx ] .",
    "[ r : kl ]    the independence of @xmath22 and @xmath12 imply that the density @xmath65 of @xmath66 is given by a mixing formula ( [ e : sic2 ] ) involving @xmath67 via the self - similar scaling property @xmath68 . a delicate use of laplace s method then allows to translate theorem [ t : mixx ] into small-@xmath7 asymptotics for @xmath69 for any @xmath70 which is out of the moneyin the context of call pricing , in the sense that the big @xmath71 term depends on a parameter @xmath72 to allow for @xmath73 ( future stock price parameter @xmath70 , which stands in for strike price @xmath4 when one computes an iv , exceeds initial stock price @xmath74 by a margin @xmath75 ) .",
    "we find ( theorem [ t : charc ] ) that for all for @xmath73 @xmath76where the repeated notation @xmath77 refers to kl elements for @xmath78 , and where @xmath79 is the multiplicity of the @xmath80th largest kl eigenvalue @xmath81 .",
    "the symbol @xmath71 depends only on the covariance of @xmath12 , but not on @xmath70 or @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath82 depends on the covariance of @xmath12 and on @xmath9 , but not @xmath70 .",
    "we prove formula ( [ dtconstant ] ) under the assumptions that @xmath83 and the volatility process @xmath84 is centered .",
    "the case where @xmath85 and the process @xmath84 is noncentered is more complicated and will be addressed in future publications .",
    "being able to establish the precise @xmath70-behavior of the error terms above is crucial to tranposing the behavior of @xmath69 to the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "specifically , we obtain the following for the out - of - the - money call as @xmath86 ( theorem [ t : call ] ) : for @xmath87,@xmath88where the big @xmath71 above does not depend on @xmath4 if it is away from @xmath74 , and the constant @xmath89 is explicit and proportional to the constant on the right - hand side of line ( [ dtconstant ] ) .",
    "a nearly indentical result is obtained for out - of - the - money put prices @xmath90 ( for @xmath91 using symmetries of the problem ( theorem [ t : put ] ) .    ultimately ,",
    "relying on a general result of gao and lee @xcite for computing the small - time asymptotics of iv based on those of @xmath45 , we obtain in theorems [ t : fiv ] and [ t : fivy ] that for @xmath92,@xmath93where the big @xmath71 is again uniform over @xmath4 in any compact interval away from @xmath31 and @xmath74 . the dominant factor in the expression ( [ cee ] ) for @xmath45 , and its analogue for @xmath94 , is the exponential one . in the expression ( eye ) for @xmath46 , there is only one candidate for a dominant term .",
    "consequently , one gets a way to estimate @xmath0 using call or put prices or ivs away from the money as empirical statistics:@xmath95where the first line holds for @xmath87 , the second for @xmath96 , and the third holds for all @xmath5 ( corollaries [ c : corrola ] , c : toyota , [ c : fiv ] , and [ c : fivy ] . )",
    "these expressions for @xmath0 do not depend on any of the model parameters and statistics , and are in this sense model free within the class of self - similar models .",
    "however , in practice , since the regime @xmath97 is limited by the ability to trade options in a liquid way sufficiently close to maturity , the full asymptotics in ( cee ) and ( [ eye ] ) will typically be needed to help control the estimation error .",
    "we notice that the above asymptotics for @xmath45 and @xmath46 formally lose information when @xmath6 , since the expression @xmath98 is zero and thus kills the dominant terms .",
    "hence the estimators for @xmath0 above are not longer valid in that case .",
    "we investigate this at - the - money situation in some detail .",
    "the delicate calculations are largely performed by hand .",
    "the resulting asymptotics seem to rely on model statistics which can not be related to the kl elements in any simple fashion , since they require computing the moments @xmath99 and @xmath100 of order @xmath101 and @xmath102 of the non - explicit integrated variance s law . as @xmath97",
    ", we get in corollary [ c : bis ] that@xmath103and in theorem [ t : aiv ] that @xmath104again , simple @xmath0-estimators can result , which do not rely on the moments @xmath99 and @xmath100 , such as theorem [ t : recover ] : @xmath105    to illustrate the usage of our various asymptotic formulas numerically , we provide simulated stock prices , with corresponding call prices and ivs , from the self - similar volatility model , using a classical a monte - carlo method . using market - realistic parameter choices ,",
    "we show how close prices and ivs are to our asymptotic formulas , noting that the fit is good in the call price case , and is excellent in the iv case , for time - to - maturity as large as 2 weeks .",
    "it is then not surprising when we show that our iv - based model - free calibration formulas for @xmath0 are accurate to @xmath106 decimal points up to 7 days in most cases , and 14 days in some cases .",
    "being able to use the longest - possible time to maturity is important in practice because of liquidity considerations .",
    "this is all explained in section [ num ] .",
    "the remainder of the article is structured as follows . some mathematical background on gaussian volatility models , taken largely from @xcite ,",

    "our first goal is to obtain an asymptotic formula for the implied volatility with error term of the order @xmath385 , by using formula ( [ e : erore ] ) in ( [ e : err ] ) . following this plan",
    ", we obtain @xmath386 as @xmath97 .",
    "now , it is not difficult to see that formula ( [ e : ft ] ) follows from ( [ e : c1 ] ) , ( [ e : c2 ] ) , and ( [ e : finni ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ t : aiv ] .",
    "[ r : intv ]    theorem [ t : aiv ] allows us to recover the self - similarity index @xmath0 knowing the small - time behavior of the at - the - money implied volatility .",
    "[ t : recover ] the following formula holds : @xmath105",
    "to illustrate the numerical potential of our asymptotic formulas in practice , we finish this article with a brief section comparing exact ( monte - carlo - simulated ) option prices and ivs with the asymptotics we have derived . formulas such as ( [ eye ] ) can be used to calibrate various parameters which might be linked explicitly or empirically to @xmath387 , assuming @xmath0 is known .",
    "we refer to the numerics in our prior work in @xcite for details on what can be done , leaving to the interested reader any details of how to translate the ideas therein which are for extreme strike asymptotics to the small time case .",
    "@xcite also contains a description of how to simulate the fbm - driven models of interest to us , for monte - carlo purposes , as alluded to in remark [ r : kl ] ; we do not repeat this information here .",
    "our results in the at - the - money case are presumably harder to exploit along these lines because they depend on moment statistics @xmath99 and @xmath388 ( remark [ r : intv ] ) , which are not explicitly related to model parameters .",
    "an exception to this observation is in the case of models with a volatility scale parameter @xmath43 , by which we mean that one replaces model ( [ e : svm ] ) with @xmath389here the parameter @xmath43 is rather inoccuous since , by self - similarity of @xmath390 , this @xmath43 can be absorbed as a linear time change , but it represents a convenient parameter for tuning a model to realistic time - scales and volatility levels .",
    "we will use this device in this section .",
    "in particular , at the money , it is easy to see from theorem t : aiv that one has@xmath391 + o\\left ( t^{5h+2}\\right)\\]]where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are given in remark [ r : intv ] .",
    "thus at - the - money iv asymptotics can be used to calibrate @xmath43 in model ( withsigma ) .",
    "we do not comment on this further herein .",
    "instead , we provide a numerical analysis of our results use in @xmath0 s calibration . indeed , the reference @xcite contains an effort to calibrate @xmath0 itself , when other parameters have been estimated by other means , but left some stones unturned .",
    "we found therein that @xmath0 calibration can be relatively successful in some cases in practice , though this is not necessarily backed up by any asymptotic theory . in this section",
    "we show instead how model - free results such as corollary [ c : fiv ] and theorem t : recover provide excellent calibration of @xmath0 in many cases .",
    "we choose to present this in the at - the - money case for two reasons .",
    "first , it illustrates the model - free framework , since the results we obtain are not sensitive to the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "second , in practice , liquidity is low for options away from the money near maturity , which all but dictates the use of at - the - money iv .",
    "the setup we use is that of model ( [ withsigma ] ) with @xmath392 fbm , @xmath83 , and @xmath393 . the choice of @xmath43 is tailored to provide a realistic volatility level after 1 or 2 weeks , with time measured in years",
    "specifically , a practicioner may simply select the desired magnitude of @xmath43 by matching it to the mean magnitude of volatility in ( withsigma ) via the formula@xmath394 = \\sigma t^{h}\\sqrt{2/\\pi } .\\]]for example , with @xmath395 and @xmath393 we get @xmath396 \\approx 0.22 $ ] after one week ( @xmath397 , ) and @xmath398 \\approx 0.34 $ ] after one week ( @xmath399 ) , which could represent a realistic scenario for a volatile short - term bond market .",
    "values of @xmath43 closer to unity result in much smaller volatility values near maturity ; these allow for an extremely sharp fit between theoretical call and iv values and our asymptotics , but would typically be unrealistically small , hence our choice of @xmath393 .    before using theorem [ t : recover ] , a first question might be whether it would not be sufficient to use an asymptotic theory for call prices to estimate parameters .",
    "the use of iv over option prices has been advocated in many articles , including many of the ones cited herein , but the question is still legitimate since one rarely sees evidence in the literature that this is indeed preferable in practice .",
    "the two images in figure 1 compare the fit between our asymptotic formulas ( corollary [ c : bis ] and theorem t : aiv ) and exact ( simulated ) call and iv values for times from 1 day to 2 weeks .",
    "we chose the extreme case @xmath402 because , as it turns out , the asymptotics accuracy increase as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we see from the above that the iv asymptotics are accurate at a roughly @xmath403-error level for more than 10 days , and remains fairly accurate up to 2 weeks , while the call asymptotics are only accurate at a @xmath403-error level for 2 days , and deteriorate significantly thereafter .",
    "other values of @xmath0 show similar pictures .",
    "the choice to use iv over call prices for calibration purposes in small time is clear .",
    "this can of course be verified rigorously on our formulas since our coefficients can be computed numerically as well ; this is omitted from our study .",
    "the four pictures in figure 2 show the extremely sharp fit of iv asymptotics over two weeks as @xmath0 increases , as we mentioned .",

    "this is evident from the last tables below , in which we show the result of the calibration of @xmath0 from exact ( simulated ) option prices , via theorem [ t : recover].@xmath411@xmath412@xmath413@xmath414 in all cases , even with a 14-day time to maturity , the error in @xmath0-calibration is no greater than one hundredth ( less than @xmath415 relative error ) .",
    "the only difficulty we experience appears to be in differentiating between a model with brownian scaling ( @xmath416 , no memory in the volatility ) and a model with @xmath417 , except for the very short times to maturity @xmath418 days .",
    "if liquidity at those levels is adequate , as it may be in heavily traded bond markets , then our calibration can be used with such short horizons .",
    "otherwise a maturity of one week is preferable , particularly for self - similarity indices which are not too close to @xmath419 .",
    "a maturity of two weeks will work in all cases for scenarios where one is satisfied with a possible error of one hundredth on @xmath0 calibration ; this could be a realistic accuracy level for many users of stochastic volatiltiy models who are currently not using any self - similarity or long - memory assumptions .",
