    "linguistic typology aims to distinguish between logically possible languages and actually observed languages .",
    "a fundamental building block for such an understanding is the _ universal implication _",
    "these are short statements that restrict the space of languages in a concrete way ( for instance `` object - verb ordering implies adjective - noun ordering '' ) ; , and provide excellent introductions to linguistic typology .",
    "we present a statistical model for automatically discovering such implications from a large typological database @xcite .",
    "analyses of universal implications are typically performed by linguists , inspecting an array of @xmath0-@xmath1 languages and a few pairs of features .",
    "looking at all pairs of features ( typically several hundred ) is virtually impossible by hand .",
    "moreover , it is insufficient to simply look at counts .",
    "for instance , results presented in the form `` verb precedes object implies prepositions in 16/19 languages '' are nonconclusive . while compelling , this is not enough evidence to decide if this is a statistically well - founded implication . for one ,",
    "maybe @xmath2 of languages have prepositions : then the fact that we ve achieved a rate of @xmath3 actually seems really bad .",
    "moreover , if the @xmath4 languages are highly related historically or areally ( geographically ) , and the other @xmath5 are not , then we may have only learned something about geography .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a statistical model that deals cleanly with these difficulties . by building a computational model ,",
    "it is possible to apply it to a very large typological database and search over many thousands of pairs of features .",
    "our model hinges on two novel components : a statistical noise model a hierarchical inference over language families . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no prior work directly in this area . the closest work is represented by the books _ possible and probable languages _",
    "@xcite and _ language classification by numbers _",
    "@xcite , but the focus of these books is on automatically discovering phylogenetic trees for languages based on indo - european cognate sets @xcite .",

    "we have presented a bayesian model for discovering universal linguistic implications from a typological database .",
    "our model is able to account for noise in a linguistically plausible manner .",
    "our hierarchical models deal with the sampling issue in a unique way , by using prior knowledge about language families to `` group '' related languages .",
    "quantitatively , the hierarchical information turns out to be quite useful , regardless of whether it is phylogenetically- or areally - based .",
    "qualitatively , our model can recover many well - known implications as well as many more potential implications that can be the object of future linguistic study .",
    "we believe that our model is sufficiently general that it could be applied to many different typological databases  we attempted not to `` overfit '' it to wals .",
    "our hope is that the automatic discovery of such implications not only aid typologically - inclined linguists , but also other groups .",
    "for instance , well - attested universal implications have the potential to reduce the amount of data field linguists need to collect .",
    "they have also been used computationally to aid in the learning of unsupervised part of speech taggers @xcite .",
    "many extensions are possible to this model ; for instance attempting to uncover typologically hierarchies and other higher - order structures .",
    "we have made the full output of all models available at http://hal3.name/wals ."

    "<S> a standard form of analysis for linguistic typology is the universal implication . </S>",
    "<S> these implications state facts about the range of extant languages , such as `` if objects come after verbs , then adjectives come after nouns . '' </S>",
    "<S> such implications are typically discovered by painstaking hand analysis over a small sample of languages . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a computational model for assisting at this process . </S>",
    "<S> our model is able to discover both well - known implications as well as some novel implications that deserve further study . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , through a careful application of hierarchical analysis , we are able to cope with the well - known sampling problem : languages are not independent . </S>"
