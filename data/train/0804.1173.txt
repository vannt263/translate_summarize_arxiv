    "richard rado studied the following problem : what is the largest @xmath7 such that , given any arrangement of unit - disks @xmath8 in the plane , we can always select a pairwise disjoint subset of disks that cover at least a fraction @xmath7 of the area of the union of @xmath8 ?",
    "clearly @xmath9 , corresponding to the case shown in figure  [ spirographs ]  ( left ) where a large number of unit - disks share a very small intersection  the common intersection prevents us from selecting more than a single disk , while the union area of all disks approaches @xmath10 .",

    "we will review rado s proof and prove the weaker result that @xmath20 , as formally stated in theorem  [ basicthm ] .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ motivation ]",
    "we present our motivation for exploring this problem and discuss some related problems .",
    "in section  [ thebasicbound ] we review rado s proof and prove theorem  [ basicthm ] . in section  [ weightedsection ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ weightedthm ] . in section  [ algorithmstuff ]",
    "we present an @xmath5 time algorithm to select a subset which achieves our @xmath6 bound from theorem  [ basicthm ] and prove that the lattice - positioning step in our algorithm is 3sum - hard .",
    "finally , section  [ extension ] discusses bounds for @xmath22-colours when @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we describe a wireless network deployment problem that motivates our 3-coloured disk packing problem , and discuss other disk packing results related to ours .",
    "wi - fi ( ieee 802.11 ) wireless networks are becoming a ubiquitous feature in modern businesses , universities , parks , etc . in a typical wi - fi deployment scenario , a set of candidate locations",
    "are determined for wireless access points ( aps ) .",
    "a subset of the candidate locations must be chosen along with a channel assignment for each installed ap in order to maximize the area covered by the wireless network while minimizing interference .",
    "interference occurs when two aps using the same channel are within range of one another , preventing users in range of both aps from communicating with either . for a more in depth discussion of wireless network deployment ,",
    "see the introduction to  @xcite .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the coverage area of each ap is a disk , though in practice coverage areas may be more irregular .",
    "we also assume that every ap uses the same power level  i.e .  that all the disks have the same radius .",
    "this is not entirely unjustified , as the problem of power control for wi - fi network devices is a complex research area in its own right  @xcite . finally",
    ", the set of potential locations for aps is limited to those that are physically possible and aesthetically acceptable .",
    "we model this as a finite set of disk center points . under these conditions ,",
    "the wireless network deployment problem becomes a @xmath22-coloured disk packing problem , where @xmath22 is the number of allowable channels . to justify @xmath24",
    ", we will discuss the constraints on channel selection in wi - fi networks .",
    "the ieee 802.11 standard establishes a number of requirements on the radio frequency characteristics of 802.11 hardware .",
    "the 2.4-ghz band used by 802.11 devices is broken into 11 channels for the north american domain and 13 channels for the european domain .",
    "unfortunately , the number of effective channels is much lower due to interference between channels with center frequencies close to one another .",
    "a study by wireless hardware maker cisco systems recommends that wireless network deployments only use three channels ( 1 , 6 , and 11 for the north american domain ) , finding that even a four - channel scheme can cause unacceptable degradation of service in systems with a high volume of users  @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated formalization of the deployment problem allows disks assigned to the same channel to overlap but only counts the area where there is no interference ",
    "i.e . the area of the set of points covered by only one disk on some channel . in terms of colouring ,",
    "the problem is to colour a subset of the given disks to maximize the area of @xmath25 for some colour , point @xmath26 is in exactly one disk of that colour@xmath27 .",
    "we call this the _",
    "1-covered area_. asano et al .",
    "@xcite proved that it is always possible to achieve approximately @xmath28 1-covered area using only one colour .",
    "this model has also been considered with respect to two other optimization problems . for the problem of maximizing the 1-covered area using one colour ,",
    "previous work has focused on approximation algorithms ( though no proof yet exists , it is suspected that this problem is np - hard ) . in @xcite , asano et al .",
    "present a 5.83-approximation algorithm with polynomial runtime . in @xcite , chen et al .",
    "show that the problem admits a polynomial time approximation scheme when the radius of the largest disk over the radius of the smallest disk is a constant .",
    "another well - explored optimization problem is _ conflict - free colouring_here the goal is to minimize the number of colours needed to 1-cover the whole area , i.e.  the union of the given disks .",
    "even et al .",
    "@xcite prove that @xmath29 colours are always sufficient and sometimes necessary for any given disks of general radii .",
    "alon et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that , if each disk intersects at most @xmath22 others , then @xmath30 colours are sufficient for a conflict - free colouring , improving the bound from @xcite when @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "there is also work on online algorithms for conflict - free colouring  @xcite , and on conflict - free colouring of regions other than disks  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind our proof of the basic bound is similar to that used by rado in  @xcite . in rado s",
    "proof , a regular triangular lattice of side length 4 is positioned over the set of disks @xmath8 and for each lattice point that falls in @xmath32 one disk containing that lattice point is selected .",
    "the side length of the lattice guarantees that disks selected in this manner will be pairwise disjoint ( see figure  [ twocirclesintriangle ] ) .",
    "thus , supposing we can prove a lower bound of @xmath22 on the number of lattice points intersecting any given set of disks , we immediately obtain a lower bound of @xmath33 .",
    "we get such a lower bound by applying lemma  [ radofundamentalcell ] which states that we can position the lattice to contain at least @xmath34 points in @xmath32 , where @xmath35 is the area of a triangle in the lattice .",
    "since @xmath36 for our lattice , we can position the lattice to contain at least @xmath37 points in @xmath32 and therefore @xmath38 .",
    "[ radofundamentalcell ] given a region of the plane @xmath39 with area @xmath0 , and a triangular lattice in which each triangle has area @xmath35 , the lattice can always be positioned such that it contains @xmath34 points in @xmath39 .",
    "rado s proof  @xcite uses the concept of the `` fundamental cell '' of a lattice  for a regular triangular lattice the fundamental cell @xmath40 consists of a pair of adjacent triangles ( see figure  [ 3coloursgrid ] ) . given an arbitrary placement of the lattice , each triangle of the lattice",
    "can be translated to @xmath40 along with whatever part of @xmath39 is contained in the triangle .",
    "the translated parts of @xmath39 may `` overlap '' in @xmath40there may be points on the fundamental cell intersecting multiple translated portions of @xmath39 . supposing a point @xmath26 in @xmath40 intersects @xmath22 translated portions of @xmath39 , then repositioning the lattice such that @xmath26 is a lattice point ensures that @xmath22 lattice points intersect @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", we refer to @xmath22 as the _ depth _ of point @xmath26 in the fundamental cell .",
    "since the area of @xmath39 is @xmath0 , the total area of all portions of @xmath39 translated to @xmath40 is clearly also @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we have portions of @xmath39 with total area @xmath0 translated to a region of area @xmath41 and a point of depth at least @xmath34 must exist .",
    "let @xmath8 be a collection of unit - disks in the plane with union area @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath15 a 3-coloured subset of @xmath8 with same - coloured disks pairwise disjoint , let @xmath17 denote @xmath15 s union area .",
    "we can always select a @xmath15 such that @xmath21 .    to solve our variation of the problem we use a finer triangular lattice with side length @xmath43 .",
    "the points of the lattice are 3-coloured such that no two lattice points of the same colour are adjacent . for any placement of the lattice , select a subset @xmath15 of @xmath8 as follows : for each lattice point @xmath26 in the union of @xmath8 , select a disk containing @xmath26 and assign the disk the colour of @xmath26 .",
    "the side length of the lattice ensures that no disk contains two lattice points so the selection and colouring are well - defined .",
    "it also ensures that disks assigned the same colour are pairwise disjoint ( see figure  [ 3coloursgrid ] ) .",
    "also observe that , by lemma  [ radofundamentalcell ] , we can position the lattice to intersect the union area of @xmath8 in at least @xmath44 points , so @xmath45 . while same - coloured disks in @xmath15 are pairwise disjoint , differently coloured disks may not be , so @xmath46 is only an upper bound on @xmath17 .    to derive a lower bound we will partition the union of @xmath15 using the triangular lattice s voronoi tessellation which has regular hexagonal cells of side length @xmath47 and vertices at the barycenters of the triangular lattice ( see figure [ tessellation ] ) .",
    "suppose disk @xmath48 contains lattice point @xmath26 which lies in hexagonal cell @xmath49 .",
    "if we count only the area of @xmath50 , and sum over all @xmath51 , this gives a lower bound on @xmath17 . thus if we establish a lower bound @xmath52 on the minimum possible area of @xmath50 then @xmath53 . in lemma",
    "[ lemma1 ] , which we will prove in section  [ mindiskhexint ] , we show that @xmath54 . from the lower bound on @xmath17",
    "we reach our desired lower bound on @xmath14 of @xmath55          [ lemma1 ] given a regular hexagon @xmath49 with center point @xmath56 and side length @xmath47 , and any unit - disk @xmath51 containing point @xmath56 , the minimum area of intersection @xmath52 between @xmath49 and @xmath51 is approximately @xmath57 , or more precisely @xmath58    we use elementary geometry to argue that the minimum area of intersection is achieved by a disk @xmath51 with @xmath56 on its boundary . then , parameterizing by the angle @xmath59 between the horizontal axis and the ray from @xmath56 to the center of @xmath51 , we use the symbolic geometry package geometry expressions to give a formula for the area of intersection and use maple to compute 0 s of the first derivative , finding that the minimum is as stated above , and occurs in the configuration shown in figure  [ tightboundtri ] .",
    "further details are included in appendix  [ theappendix ] .",
    "our proof of lemma  [ lemma1 ] also shows that the lower bound @xmath60 is tight , as shown by the example in figure  [ tightboundtri ] where the union of @xmath15 is exactly partitioned by the hexagons and each disk intersects its hexagon in the minimum area @xmath52",
    ". however , note that this does not mean that our bound on @xmath14 is tight .",
    "in particular , for the example shown in figure  [ tightboundtri ] we can capture the whole area by 3-colouring the disks .",
    "in our proof of theorem  [ basicthm ] we only counted the minimum intersection of a disk with its selecting voronoi cell ( the voronoi cell of the lattice point that selects the disk ) .",
    "suppose we commit to this accounting scheme .",
    "we can clearly maximize the intersection of the disk with its voronoi cell by centering the selecting lattice point in the disk .",
    "this suggests that we can use a weighting function that prefers placing a lattice point in the center of a disk , and do a more intricate analysis of the contribution of each disk .",
    "looking at this from another direction , in the proof of theorem  [ basicthm ] we optimized the number of disks selected , rather than the area of the intersection between selected disks and their selecting voronoi cells .",
    "this approach can be improved because , among all subsets of disks that can be selected using a lattice , the largest subset of disks does not necessarily cover the largest area ( e.g.  see figure  [ moreisnotbetter ] where selecting the three intersecting disks using the lattice shown gives a subset with union area @xmath61 , while an alternate lattice positioning that selects two disjoint disks gives a subset with union area @xmath62 ) .",
    "the above points suggest that we can improve our bound on @xmath14 by using a more sophisticated criterion for lattice positioning based on the area contributed by selected disks rather than the number of disks selected .",
    "we will use this approach to prove theorem  [ weightedthm ] .",
    "let @xmath8 be a collection of unit - disks in the plane with union area @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath15 a 3-coloured subset of @xmath8 with same - coloured disks pairwise disjoint , let @xmath17 denote @xmath15 s union area .",
    "we can always select a @xmath15 such that @xmath18 and thus @xmath16 .    to prove this better bound , we use a weighted version of lemma  [ radofundamentalcell ] . whereas lemma  [ radofundamentalcell ] proved that a lattice @xmath64 can be positioned to intersect @xmath32 in at least a certain number of points , we want to prove that @xmath64 can be positioned to intersect @xmath32 with at least a certain weight .",
    "we now define the weight function . for point",
    "@xmath26 , let @xmath65 be the regular hexagon of side length @xmath47 centered at @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath65 is the voronoi cell of @xmath26 if our triangular lattice is translated to include point @xmath26 . for @xmath66 , let @xmath67 be the disk containing @xmath26 whose intersection with @xmath65 has maximum area . now let @xmath68 for @xmath66 , @xmath69 otherwise",
    ". then @xmath70 measures the area contributed by including @xmath26 in the lattice ( given our method of choosing disks based on the lattice , and our accounting scheme of counting only the area of the disk in the voronoi cell ) .",
    "we want to choose a lattice @xmath64 to maximize @xmath71 .",
    "proving a lower bound on the maximum value of @xmath72 for lattices of the type used in our proof of theorem  [ basicthm ] will give us a lower bound on @xmath14 .",
    "as in the proof of lemma  [ radofundamentalcell ] we consider translating portions of @xmath32 onto a fundamental cell .",
    "after translation , each point @xmath26 on the fundamental cell is assigned the sum of the weights of @xmath26 s intersection with each translated portion of @xmath32 .",
    "supposing that a point @xmath26 on the fundamental cell has weight @xmath73 , then positioning @xmath64 such that @xmath26 is a lattice point ensures that @xmath74 .",
    "thus , if we can prove that the total weight of the portions of @xmath32 translated to the fundamental cell is @xmath75 , then a point in the fundamental cell ( and therefore a lattice positioning ) with weight at least @xmath76 must exist .     in terms of distance from @xmath26 to the nearest disk center.,width=115 ]",
    "we can not compute exactly the value of @xmath75 , which is the integral of @xmath70 over @xmath66 , but we can obtain a lower bound . our first step is to replace the true weight function @xmath70 by a lower bound , @xmath77 , in which we replace the hexagon by its inscribed circle ( see figure  [ simplerintfunction ] ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath77 is the area of the intersection of two discs : the disk of radius @xmath78 centered at @xmath26 , and the unit - disk in @xmath8 whose center is closest to @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath77 depends only on the distance , @xmath79 , from @xmath26 to the nearest disk center in @xmath8 .",
    "we will overload the notation and define @xmath80 , for @xmath81 $ ] , to be the area of the intersection of a unit - disk and a disk of radius @xmath78 whose centers are distance @xmath79 apart .",
    "we note that @xmath80 is a continuous , decreasing function , and that we can write an explicit formula for it :    @xmath82    we will express @xmath75 as an integral in terms of variable @xmath79 .",
    "note that the points on the boundary of @xmath32 are precisely the points at distance 1 from the closest disk center .",
    "more generally , we can capture the points that are distance @xmath79 from the closest disk center as follows .",
    "for unit - disk @xmath83 , let @xmath84 be a disk of radius @xmath79 at the same center .",
    "let @xmath85 be @xmath86 .",
    "then the points that are distance @xmath79 from the closest disk center are precisely the points on the boundary of @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 be the length of the boundary of @xmath87 .",
    "as @xmath89 , we obtain :    @xmath90    we prove a lower bound on the latter integral that eliminates @xmath88 .",
    "[ integral - bound ] @xmath91 .",
    "after this we are done : we plug in the expression for @xmath80 and evaluate the integral using maple to obtain a lower bound on @xmath75 of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore a lattice positioning with weight at least @xmath93 must exist , and we get our desired lower bound of @xmath94 .    it remains to prove the lemma .",
    "we want to prove @xmath95 , equivalently :    @xmath96 w_l(r)\\,dr \\ge 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let @xmath97 be the area of @xmath87 , which is related to the perimeter by the fact that @xmath98 .",
    "define @xmath99 . recall that @xmath100 is the area of @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath101 .",
    "now @xmath102 , and the inequality we want to prove is transformed into @xmath103 .",

    "thus @xmath109 for all @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "now @xmath80 is a decreasing function , so @xmath110 for all @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the integral of a negative function is negative , and this completes the proof .        [ bollobasextended ] given a collection of unit - disks with union area @xmath0 , if we scale the radius of each disk by @xmath81 $ ] then the union area of the scaled disks will be at least @xmath111 .",
    "we want to scale the radius of each disk by @xmath79 .",
    "we accomplish this in two steps .",
    "first we scale the whole plane by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "this reduces the area to @xmath111 .",
    "it also decreases the distance between the centers of any two disks by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "the second step is to translate each scaled disk back to its original position . during the translation the distance between the centers of any two disks increases continuously . by a result of bollobs  @xcite , the union area of a set of congruent disks moving apart from one another",
    "continuously can not decrease , and therefore the area of the final arrangement of scaled disks is at least @xmath111 .",
    "in this section we give an @xmath5 time algorithm to select and 3-colour a subset @xmath15 of a set @xmath8 of unit - disks so that the area bound given in theorem  [ basicthm ] is realized .",
    "the proof of our theorem is constructive , and the only algorithmic issue is positioning the lattice so that at least @xmath44 lattice points are in @xmath32 ( the union of all disks in @xmath8 ) .",
    "we give an @xmath5 time algorithm for this lattice positioning problem .",
    "we also prove that the lattice positioning problem is 3sum - hard , providing evidence that an @xmath5 time algorithm is the best we can expect with this approach .    to solve the lattice positioning problem we follow the constructive approach used to prove lemma  [ radofundamentalcell ] , initially positioning the lattice arbitrarily and then translating all triangles in the lattice along with portions of @xmath32 to a fundamental cell @xmath40 .",
    "thus the one remaining detail is how to capture the translated portions of @xmath32 so that we can compute a point of maximum depth .",
    "our basic idea involves translating all of the disks and then computing and traversing their arrangement .",
    "each disk @xmath51 intersects at most 4 translates of @xmath40 .",
    "we make 4 translated copies of @xmath51 , and record which translate of @xmath40 they come from .",
    "computing this set of translated disks @xmath112 takes @xmath113 time .",
    "computing the arrangement of @xmath112 , @xmath114 , takes @xmath5 time using the incremental insertion algorithm of chazelle and lee  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to traverse @xmath114 to compute maximum depth in @xmath112the depth increases when we enter a disk and decreases when we exit .",
    "however , this is not quite what we want ; we want depth with respect to @xmath32 translated to @xmath40 , which is different from depth in @xmath112 due to disks that overlap originally in @xmath8 .",
    "our solution is to traverse @xmath114 maintaining the depth @xmath115 in each translate @xmath116 of @xmath40 .",
    "note that there are @xmath113 translates of @xmath40 that intersect @xmath32 .",
    "we also maintain a count @xmath117 of the number of non - zero @xmath115 s .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath117 over cells of @xmath114 gives us what we want .",
    "we now prove that the lattice positioning problem discussed above is 3sum - hard .",
    "a problem is _ 3sum - hard _ if it is harder than the problem of determining whether a set @xmath118 of @xmath31 integers contains three elements @xmath119 such that @xmath120 .",
    "the best known algorithms for this problem take @xmath5 and it is an open problem to do better @xcite .    [ 3sumproof ] the following problem is 3sum - hard : given an integer @xmath22 , real number @xmath121 , and a set @xmath8 of @xmath31 unit - disks in the plane , determine whether a triangular lattice of side length @xmath121 can be positioned such that it intersects the union area of @xmath8 in at least @xmath22 points .",
    "we show that our problem is harder than the known 3sum - hard problem of determining whether there is a point of depth @xmath22 in a set of unit radius disks in the plane .",
    "the more general problem for variable radius disks is proved 3sum - hard in @xcite and the reduction is easily modified to produce unit radius disks .",
    "our reduction is as follows .",
    "given a set @xmath8 of unit radius disks in the plane , place an equilateral triangle @xmath122 large enough to contain all of @xmath8 .",
    "expand @xmath122 to a triangular lattice , and translate each disk of @xmath8 to a different cell in the lattice , with the same orientation .",
    "let the translated set of disks be @xmath112 .",
    "then there is a point of depth @xmath22 in @xmath8 if and only if the lattice can be translated to intersect @xmath112 in @xmath22 points .",
    "this reduction takes linear time .",
    "while we have focused on the case of 3 colours , since that is relevant for channel assignment in wireless networks , it is interesting to see what bounds can be derived for other numbers of colours . for 2 colours",
    ", we can use the techniques used to prove theorems  1  and  2 but with a 2-coloured square lattice of side length @xmath123 .",
    "this approach leads to a bound of @xmath124 analogous to the bound from theorem  [ weightedthm ] , and a weaker bound of @xmath125 for which an @xmath5 algorithm exists for selecting disks to satisfy the bound .",
    "full details are included in the thesis of benjamin lafreniere  @xcite .    for the more general problem of @xmath22-colours , theorem  [ kcolourbound ]",
    "presents some preliminary results , demonstrating a bound for all @xmath22 such that @xmath126 .",

    "thus we can partition @xmath64 into @xmath22 triangular lattices of side length @xmath131 and assign each a unique colour .",
    "we then scale @xmath64 such that distance 2 separates the enclosing disks of voronoi cells of same - coloured lattice points by applying a scaling factor of @xmath133 .",
    "now , each disk in @xmath8 is assigned to the voronoi cell containing its center .",
    "we select from each voronoi cell one associated disk ( if there are any ) and colour it to match the voronoi cell s lattice point .",
    "note that by our scaling , same - coloured selected disks can not intersect .",
    "if a point @xmath26 is in @xmath32 but is not in any selected disk , then the disk covering @xmath26 intersects another disk with center in the same voronoi cell , and the distance between their center points is less than the diameter of the voronoi cell @xmath134 .",
    "now , if all selected disks were blown up by a factor of @xmath135 , @xmath26 would be covered by some selected disk and the union of selected disks would cover at most @xmath136 . thus ,",

    "our first claim is that the minimum area of intersection is achieved by a disk @xmath51 positioned such that @xmath56 , the center point of hexagon @xmath49 , lies on its boundary .",
    "suppose this is not the case . by symmetry",
    ", it suffices to consider possible placements of @xmath137 , the center point of @xmath51 , within the intersection of wedge @xmath138 and the unit - disk centered at @xmath56 in figure  [ slide_outward_proof ] . for any position of @xmath137 , moving @xmath137 to the right along a line parallel to @xmath139 decreases the area of intersection , since the portion of @xmath140 lying above the supporting line of @xmath139 stays the same , and the portion of @xmath140 below the supporting line of @xmath139 strictly increases ( by containment ) .",
    "thus we can move @xmath137 to the right until it lies either on @xmath141 or the boundary of the disk centered at @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath137 on @xmath141 , moving @xmath137 toward @xmath142 decreases @xmath50 because when the diameter of @xmath51 parallel to @xmath143 lies strictly inside @xmath49 , the area of @xmath140 increases ( by containment ) , and when the diameter is not strictly contained in @xmath49 , the area of @xmath50 decreases ( by containment ) .",
    "thus we can restrict our attention to the minimum area of intersection with @xmath49 among disks whose boundary contains point @xmath56 . to find this minimum , we assume that @xmath144 and express the area of intersection @xmath145 in terms of angle @xmath59 between the center of a disk @xmath51 , the center @xmath56 of @xmath49 , and the @xmath146-axis .",

    "case  2 occurs when @xmath51 only contains a single vertex of @xmath49 ( e.g.  figure  [ intersection_on_point ] ) .",
    "note that in either case we can express the area of intersection as the sum of the area of a polygon and a circle sector .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ intersection_on_edge ] the area of intersection is the sum of the area of polygon @xmath147 and the area of the sector of @xmath51 interior to angle @xmath148 .        by symmetry",
    ", we need only consider the area of intersection for @xmath149 . as a result",

    ", we use the symbolic geometry package geometry expressions to derive formulas relating @xmath59 and the intersection points between the boundaries of @xmath51 and @xmath49 ( i.e. points @xmath0 and @xmath15 in figures  [ intersection_on_edge ] and [ intersection_on_point ] ) . the derived formulas for these points , along with formulas for the other points in figures  [ intersection_on_edge ] and [ intersection_on_point ] are given in appendix  [ appendix_for_edge ] and [ appendix_for_point ] respectively . from these formulas",
    "we express the area of intersection in terms of @xmath59 using standard formulas for the area of polygons and circle sectors .",
    "this gives us formula @xmath150 for the area of intersection for @xmath151 and formula @xmath152 for the area of intersection for @xmath153 ( see appendix  [ appendix_for_edge ] and [ appendix_for_point ] . by symmetry",
    ", we extend this to formula @xmath145 for @xmath154 given in appendix  [ appendix_for_full_circle ] .",
    "a plot showing @xmath145 for the interval @xmath154 is given in figure [ intersectionareagraph ] .",
    "using maple we find that @xmath155 ( the first derivative of @xmath145 ) is 0 for @xmath156 .",
    "thus , by symmetry , the minimum intersection occurs when @xmath56 , the center point of @xmath51 and a vertex of of @xmath49 are collinear .",
