    "since the early suggestion of pines@xcite that low - energy plasmons with sound - like long - wavelength dispersion could be realized in the collective motion of a system of two types of electronic carriers , these modes have spurred over the years a remarkable interest and research activity.@xcite    the possibility of having a longitudinal acoustic mode in a metal - insulator - semiconductor ( mis ) structure was anticipated by chaplik.@xcite chaplik considered a simplified model in which a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas is separated from a semiinfinite three - dimensional ( 3d ) metal .",
    "he found that the screening of valence electrons in the metal changes the 2d plasmon energy from its characteristic square - root wave - vector dependence to a linear dispersion , which was also discussed by gumhalter@xcite in his study of transient interactions of surface - state electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs at surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , acoustic plasmons were only expected to exist for _ spatially separated _ plasmas , as pointed out by das sarma and madhukar.@xcite the experimental realization of two - dimensionally confined and spatially separated multicomponent structures , such as quantum wells and heterostructures , provided suitable solid - state systems for the observation of acoustic plasmons.@xcite acoustic plasma oscillations were then proposed as possible candidates to mediate the attractive interaction leading to the formation of cooper pairs in high-@xmath0 superconductors.@xcite    recently , silkin _",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that metal surfaces where a partially occupied quasi-2d surface - state band _ coexists _ in the same region of space with the underlying 3d continuum support a well - defined acoustic surface plasmon , which could not be explained within the original _ local _ model of chaplik.@xcite this low - energy collective excitation exhibits linear dispersion at low wave vectors , and might therefore affect e - h and phonon dynamics near the fermi level.@xcite    in this paper , we present a model in which the screening of a semiinfinite 3d metal is incorporated into the description of electronic excitations in a 2d electron gas through the introduction of an effective 2d dielectric function .",
    "we find that the dynamical screening of valence electrons in the metal changes the 2d plasmon energy from its characteristic square - root behaviour to a linear dispersion , not only in the case of a 2d sheet spatially separated from the semiinfinite metal , as anticipated by chaplik,@xcite but also when the 2d sheet coexists in the same region of space with the underlying metal , as occurs in the real situation of surface states at a metal surface .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that it is the nonlocality of the 3d dynamical response which allows the formation of 2d electron - density acoustic oscillations at metal surfaces , since these oscillations would otherwise be completely screened by the surrounding 3d substrate .",

    "we have considered the two limiting cases in which the 2d sheet is located far inside and far outside the metal surface . in both cases , the dynamical screening of the valence electrons in the metal is found to change the 2d plasmon energy from its characteristic square - root behaviour to a linear dispersion , the sound velocity being proportional to the fermi momentum of the 2d gas . as this collective oscillation occurs in a region of 2d momentum space where 2d e - h pairs can not be produced , this is a well - defined acoustic plasmon .",
