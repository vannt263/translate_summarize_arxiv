    "the variability of v781 tau was first discovered by harris ( 1979 ) according to his two nights photoelectric observations .",
    "the light curve of v781 tau shows typical w uma type .",
    "two values of orbital period , 0.@xmath6 and 0.@xmath7 , were determined by harris ( 1979 ) , but he can not point out the more accurate one .",
    "later , berthold ( 1981 , 1983 ) analyzed his photographic observations and gave an ephemeris : min .",

    "the first radial velocity observations of v781 tau were started by lu ( 1993 ) , who reanalyzed the bv light curves of cereda et al .",

    "yang & liu ( 2000 ) investigated the orbital period variation of v781 tau and found that the period of v781 tau is secular decrease with a rate of @xmath10 .",
    "new radial velocities of v781 tau were obtained by zwitter et al .",
    "they simultaneously analyzed the hipparcos and tycho photometry and radial velocity data .",
    "recently , yakut et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and kallrath et al .",
    "( 2006 ) observed and analyzed v781 tau .",
    "they all obtained the basic physical parameters and the orbital period change behavior .",
    "it has been nine years since the last investigation of v781 tau , we started photometric and spectroscopic observations in order to determine the physical parameters and the orbital period variation .",
    "photometric observations of v781 tau were carried out using the 1.0-m telescope at weihai observatory of shandong university ( hu et al .",
    "2014 ) on november 4 , 2013 and december 24 , 2014 .",
    "the observation made in 2013 was using a back - illuminated pixis 2048b ccd camera attached to the cassegrain telescope , while an andor dz936 ccd camera was used in 2014 . both of the two ccd cameras have @xmath11 square pixels ( 13.5@xmath1213.5@xmath13 m pixel@xmath14 ) , resulting an effective ccd field of about 11.8@xmath15 @xmath12 11.8@xmath15 .",

    "gsc 01870 - 00514 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and 2mass j05502287 + 2654060 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) were chosen as the comparison and check stars , respectively .",
    "all the measured images were firstly corrected with bias and flat images and then processed using the aperture photometry ( apphot ) package in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the observations on november 4 , 2013 determined a time of minimum light only .",
    "complete light curves were determined on december 24 , 2014 , the corresponding phased light curves are displayed in figure 1 and the original photometric data are shown in table 1 .",
    "the phases are calculated using the following ephemeris : @xmath25 the period in this equation is taken from kreiner ( 2004 ) .",
    "three times of minimum light are determined during the two observing nights , they are : 2456601.3948@xmath40.0002 , 2457016.1504@xmath4 + 0.0002 and 2457016.3208@xmath40.0003 .",
    "b and v light curves of v781 tau derived by cereda et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , yakut et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , kallrath et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and us are shown in figure 2 . in order to derive the change of the light curves , we shifted other light curves to our observations at the primary minimum .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , the light curve of v781 tau is changed significantly and shows positive type of oconnell effect ( oconnell 1951 ) .",
    "the differences between the two light maximum of the four sets of light curves exhibit continuously variation .",
    "this may indicate that v781 tau shows very strong magnetic activity .",
    "we used the weihai echelle spectrograph ( wes ) to obtain spectra of v781 tau for radial velocity calculation .",
    "we obtained seven spectra of v781 tau and a spectra of hd50692 as radial velocity standard star with spectral type of g0v on february 4 , 2015 .",
    "the raw data were reduced using the echelle package .",
    "radial velocities of v781 tau were obtained using task fxcor in iraf , with the spectrum of hd50692 as the template .",
    "the spectra from wes has 107 orders because of echelle spectrograph configuration .",
    "we calculated the arithmetic mean value of radial velocities from different spectral orders , and set the standard deviation divided by the square root of numbers as configuration error .",
    "the determined radial velocities of v781 tau are listed in table 2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "new ccd light curves and radial velocities of v781 tau were determined by the 1.0-m telescope at weihai observatory of shandong university . analyzing the light curves and radial velocities using the w - d code",
    "simultaneously , we derived that v781 tau has a mass ratio of @xmath1 and a fill out factor of @xmath2 .",
    "the system velocity was determined to be @xmath26 km / s .",
    "combining the solution results and radial velocities of the two components , we can determined the absolute parameters of v781 tau , they are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    using all available times of minimum light , we investigated the orbital period changes of v781 tau .",
    "it is found that the orbital period of v781 tau is secular decrease at rate of @xmath3 d / yr , and has a cyclic modulation with a period of @xmath34 yr .",
    "normally , the secular orbital period decrease is caused by mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one or by angular momentum loss via magnetic stellar wind . assuming that the mass transfer is conservative , we can determined the mass transfer rate using the following equation , @xmath35 a mass transfer rate at @xmath36 yr@xmath14 was derived .",
    "the thermal timescale of the more massive component can be computed to be @xmath37 yr , which is about 8 times of the timescale of period decrease @xmath38 yr .",
    "so , the secular period decrease should be due to the angular momentum loss by magnetic stellar wind .    the cyclic oscillation in the orbital period change of v781 tau can be caused either by the applegate mechanism ( applegate 1992 ) due to magnetically active component(s ) or by the light travel time effect due to a third companion . using the oscillation period and the amplitude listed in table 5 and the relation @xmath39 ( lanza & rodon 2002 )",
    ", we can determine that the variations of the quadrupole moment for the primary component is @xmath40 g @xmath41 .",
    "this value is about two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values @xmath42 to @xmath43 g @xmath41 for active close binaries .",
    "applegate model failed to explain the cyclic modulation in the orbital period .",
    "therefore , liking many other contact binaries , e.g. , ep and ( lee et al . 2013 ) , mr com ( qian et al .",
    "2013 ) and li et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , cyclic period variation of v781 tau is caused by the light travel time effect due to a tertiary . using the mass function , @xmath44 we determined @xmath45 .",
    "then , we can calculated that the smallest mass and the greatest septation of the third companion are @xmath46 and @xmath47 au , respectively .",
    "no third signal was found during the spectral observations and the photometric solutions , so the third body should be a very cool dwarf star or a compact object . the orbital motion of the third body can also lead to a periodic variation of the radial velocity of the central eclipsing pair .",
    "lu ( 1993 ) first determined that the system radial velocity is 24.4 km / s , and zwitter derived a 30.44 km / s value , while our result is 26.3 km / s .",
    "it seems that the radial velocity values varied in some way .",
    "but only three data points can not support a precise study .",
    "more radial velocity observations are needed .",
    "v781 tau is a w - subtype contact binary .",
    "we shows the two components of v781 tau on the mass - luminosity diagram in figure 7 .",
    "42 w - subtype low - temperature contact binary systems ( ltcbs ) given by yakut & eggleton ( 2005 ) are also plotted in figure 7 , where open triangles and circles represent the primary and the secondary of these systems , respectively . in figure 7 , zero age main sequence ( zams ) and the terminal age main sequence ( tams ) which are constructed by the binary star evolution code ( i.e. , bse code ; hurley et al .",
    "2002 ) are displayed with continuous and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "as seen in figure 7 , the locations of the two components of v781 tau is similar with other w - subtype ltcbs .",
    "the more massive secondary component is under - luminous , while the less massive primary component is over - luminous and over - sized with the respect to their zams masses",
    ". this might be the consequence of the assumption that the more massive component is transferring energy to the less massive component ( e.g. , mochnacki , 1981 ; yakut & eggleton 2005 ) .",
    "according the period changes of 30 w - subtype contact binaries , qian indicated that systems with decreasing period usually have mass ratios @xmath48 , while those with increasing period usually have mass ratios @xmath49 .",
    "then , qian ( 2003 ) expanded his results to both w- and a - subtype contact binaries .",
    "based on the statistical investigation of period changes of contact binaries , qian ( 2003 ) confirmed that the period variation of w uma - type binaries are correlated with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "he also pointed out that the thermal relaxation oscillation and the variable angular momentum loss can result in w uma - type systems oscillate around a critical mass ratio .",
    "the mass ratio of v781 tau ( @xmath52 ) is around the critical mass ratio , this binary is a particularly important system and needed more intensive study .",
