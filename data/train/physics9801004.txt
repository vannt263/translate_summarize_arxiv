    "e@xmath0e@xmath1 reactions have particular advantages for the study of particle properties and interaction pecularities .",
    "that is the reason for the worldwide discussion about problems and possibilities of future e@xmath0e@xmath1 linear colliders in the energy range between 500  1500 gev @xcite .",
    "detectors at such colliders have to handle very short bunch crossing times and/or tremendous background rates originating from new sources due to the strongly collimated beams .",
    "all these questions were studied in detail during an joint ecfa / desy workshop in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the following considerations arised from discussions during this workshop .",
    "to investigate the capabilities of special detector configurations we simulated benchmark e@xmath0e@xmath1 reactions at 500 gev :    [ cols=\"<,<,^ \" , ]     due to multiple scattering and energy loss in the fiber material the described detector will naturally influence the precission in reach for a following outer tracker .",
    "that seems to be important only for particles with energies below 2 gev , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ bild6 ] .",
    "a fiber tracker and preshower was first successfully used in the ua2experiment @xcite .",
    "we will closely follow that concept using however only fibers in z  direction because no precise tracking in two coordinates is necessary .",
    "we suggest to build a fiber  lead sandwich cylinder with a radius of 1 m and a total length of 7 m splitted in two parts in the middle . using fibers of 1 mm diameter and",
    "3.5 m length arranged with a pitch of 1.05 mm this results in 6 000 fibers per layer and cylinder half .",
    "six staggered inner layers parallel to z would allow a resolution of @xmath3 r@xmath4 = 50 @xmath2 m .",
    "after 9 mm of lead corresponding to 1.6 radiation lengths , four staggered outer layers still would give @xmath3 r@xmath4 = 80 @xmath2 m .",
    "the very good two track resolution and electron identification of such a device allows excellent @xmath5/e/@xmath6 separation important for the precise measurement of many physical variables . adding up the signals of hitted fibers for the inner and outer preshower layers the corresponding difference of the number of detected photoelectrons is shown in fig [ bild7 ] for photons , electrons and pions .",
    "correcting for the different number of layers one finds integral values of @xmath3n@xmath7 of @xmath5/e/@xmath6 = 33/105/0 .    a typical tt  production event as seen by the preshower is shown in fig .",
    "[ bild8 ] . in fig .",
    "[ bild9 ] the position of tracks weighted with light amplitudes from the hitted fibers is plotted for sector 12 of fig [ bild8 ] .",
    "one clearly can see the resolving power of the detector .",
    "an open question is how to read out the 120000 channels of the preshower . keeping in mind the low rate of interesting events",
    "there is no need to do it fast .",
    "therefore image intensifier chains and ccd already applied for ua2 and now used for the 10@xmath8 channel tracker of the chorus experiment @xcite may be a todays solution also here .",
    "fiber technology provides various interesting detector applications for a 500 gev e@xmath0e@xmath1 collider .",
    "a very fast inner trigger could select e.g. top and higgs production events with high efficiency within about 10 nsec . extended to a two coordinate measuring inner tracker a space point resolution of @xmath3 r@xmath4 = 80 @xmath2 m and @xmath3z = 410 @xmath2",
    "m could be reached .",
    "a nearly complete suppression of background of beamstrahlung seems to be possible .",
