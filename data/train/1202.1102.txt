    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs )  detected in many nearby galaxies  are defined as ( non - nuclear ) systems with x - ray luminosities exceeding @xmath0 ( see @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "ulxs are fascinating sources for several reasons .",
    "one popular interpretation is that they host so called intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh ) , with masses in the range of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , they could  bridge the gap \" between the @xmath2 stellar mass black holes ( stmbh ) seen in the milky way @xcite and the super - massive black holes ( smbh ; @xmath3 ) in the centres of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "potentially , therefore , ulxs could help us understand how smbhs have grown to have their large masses @xcite",
    ". the most luminous ulxs  like eso 24349 hlx-1 ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) and ulx m82 x-1 ( @xmath5 , @xcite )  are also the best imbh candidates , as they show similar spectral components and spectral states as galactic stmbhs @xcite , but with luminosities and spectral properties consistent with an imbh .",
    "m82 x-1 and eso 24349 hlx-1 both reside near ( or within ) young star clusters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these sites are ideal for an imbh to form and for it to capture a stellar companion from which to accrete @xcite . however , the devil is in the detail .",
    "recent simulations show that imbhs are bound to these clusters , whereas a large fraction of stmbhs are ejected from them @xcite . because many ulxs tend to be located near , but not within , these young clusters ( see e.g. @xcite and poutanen et al . 2012 , in preparation ) this suggests that a majority of ulxs are not imbhs .",
    "furthermore , several studies now clearly indicate that the majority of ulxs are connected to recent star formation episodes @xcite and that ulxs are located near star formation regions within the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "a natural explanation to these findings  and to the high luminosities of ulxs  is very high ( super - eddington ) accretion rate onto stmbhs in high - mass x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "such an accretion regime is very challenging from a theoretical point of view , because at super - eddington accretion rates many effects  such as winds / outflows and advection  can strongly affect the accretion flow properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of a super - eddington disc can be very complex , and it is difficult to compare observational x - ray data of ulxs to these models as they usually lack clear identifiable predictions .    even though a majority of ulxs could be super - eddington stmbhs in high - mass x - ray binaries , some can still be imbhs , and population studies do not provide the means to differentiate between different alternatives for a given ulx . in the absence of black hole mass measurements through radial velocity studies of optical counterparts of ulxs ( see @xcite for such an attempt ) , indirect black hole mass proxies must be used instead . many of these attempts during the last decade are based on x - ray spectroscopic measurements using  or  observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "two common spectral features in ulxs ( with respect to simple power - law fits ) are typically used : the soft excess below 2 kev , and spectral curvature / breaks above 2 kev ( see e.g. @xcite and the review of @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the soft excess has been a matter of debate .",
    "it can be related to direct accretion disc emission ( imbh case , @xcite ) , but for several ulxs the soft excess temperature does not follow the expected luminosity scaling @xmath6 ( @xcite ) . in these cases the soft excess can instead be associated with an outflow @xcite or it can be emission from a cold outer disc around stmbhs @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that in some cases the soft excess is an artefact of ionized absorption below 2 kev and incorrect modelling of the continuum emission @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral curvature / breaks are less debated and controversial as regards to the imbh vs. stmbh debate .",
    "these features can be associated with high optical depth , low temperature coronae @xcite .",
    "the presence of these breaks in ulx spectra and the absence of them in stmbh or smbh spectra supports the fact that these ulxs are in a different accretion state .",
    "this thus fits in better with the idea that the bulk of ulxs are super - eddington stmbhs rather than sub - eddington imbhs .",
    "however , only a small fraction of ulx observations have sufficient data quality at the 510 kev range to see these breaks .",
    "therefore , additional high quality x - ray data are needed to study them , as these features could provide a method of distinguishing super - eddington stmbhs from imbh candidates . in this paper , we report on a new  observation of bright and well - studied ulx holmberg ii x-1 that shows this spectral feature .",
    "the irregular dwarf galaxy holmberg ii at a distance of @xmath7 mpc ( @xcite ) hosts an ulx ( hereafter ) that has been studied extensively in recent years .",
    "@xcite found in their joint _",
    "asca _ and _ rosat _ spectral modelling that several spectral components are needed to explain the data . during  monitoring in 2002 ,",
    "the system was seen in a peculiar `` low / soft '' state @xcite , which is also seen in ngc 5204 ulx and ngc 1313 ulx-1 @xcite . in 2004 , a 100ks  observation of this ulx was performed . based on these data @xcite argued that the lack of short term variability is inconsistent with the imbh scenario ( see @xcite , for comparison with other ulxs ) .",
    "this 2004 dataset has been extensively used in recent years @xcite , and it is one of the few ulx observations that show a spectral break at @xmath8 kev @xcite .",
    "has an extended emission line nebula around it , that is powered by photo - ionization @xcite .",
    "the line emission diagnostics require an x - ray photo - ionization source to have a luminosity of the order of @xmath9 , which suggest that the x - ray emission of  can not be strongly beamed @xcite .",
    "this is further strengthened by infrared line diagnostics @xcite and radio observations @xcite .",
    "thus , we are quite confident that the x - ray emission in  is roughly isotropic .    recently ,  was monitored with  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) for four months and the x - ray flux was seen to fluctuate by up to a factor of @xmath1014 during these observations ( see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : xrt_lc ] ) .",
    "the lowest flux values seen @xmath11 indicated that the luminosity dropped down to @xmath12 ( this estimation was made using the webpimms tool for the parameters : /xrt count rate 0.02 count s@xmath13 , photon index @xmath14 and the hydrogen column density @xmath15 @xmath16 , see @xcite ) . following the drop into a low luminosity state",
    ", we triggered an  target of opportunity ( too ) observation on 2010 march 26 ( mjd 55281 , obsid 0561580401 ) , because this luminosity level is comparable to the brightest galactic stmbhs . at such low luminosity regime , we could directly compare the spectral properties between this ulx and the galactic stmbhs , and possibly see if they are similar .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ fig : xrt_lc ] indicates , the initial goal of our observation was not reached because the source underwent a minor flare prior to the observation .",
    "fortunately , however , this long  observation provided the best quality spectrum of this ulx in its peculiar  low / soft \" state @xcite .",
    "we also re - analysed the long 2004 april 15 observation ( mjd 53110 , obsid 0200470101 ) as a reference for the higher luminosity state .",
    "we processed the observation data files ( odf ) with the xmm - sas version 11 and using methods recommended in xmm - sas data analysis threads .",
    "we used the epproc and emproc pipelines to produce the calibrated event files for epic - pn and epic - mos instruments , respectively .",
    "the event selection was done using flag@xmath170 and pattern @xmath184 for epic - pn and # xmmea_em and pattern @xmath1812 for epic - mos .",
    "we then produced light curves in the 1012 kev band for each instrument over the entire detector to look for background flares .",
    "for the 2004 data we included only the time periods where the count rates were below the recommended @xmath19 count s@xmath13 for epic - pn and @xmath20 count s@xmath13 for epic - mos instruments . for the 2010 data , we found that only the latter part of the observation was affected by background flaring .",
    "we ignored this part of the observation for all the instruments , even though in few occasions the background count rate dropped below @xmath20 count s@xmath13 for epic - mos .",
    "the resulting useful exposure times for the 2010 data were 20ks for epic - pn and 25ks for epic - mos1 and mos2 . similarly , for the 2004 dataset , the good exposure times were 35ks , 55ks and 56ks for epic - pn , mos1 and mos2 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum was very soft during both observations ( photon indices @xmath21 , see below ) and thus the count rate in the 510 kev spectral band was very low . as the spectral shape above @xmath22 kev is of significant importance to study the spectral breaks ( @xcite ) , we determined optimal source extraction radii by generating images for all the epic cameras in the 510 kev band ( from the calibrated and background flare filtered event files ) and then using the eregionanalyse tool to maximize the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio in this band . for the 2004 data",
    ", this procedure resulted in source extraction radii of 40 , 37  and 38  for epic - pn , mos1 and mos2 , respectively , and for the 2010 data 27 , 22  and 23 .",
    "we used a background region of 40  radius from a nearby source - free region that was located in the same epic - pn ccd chip as the source .",
    "we then used the especget tool to extract the spectral data and response files .",
    "the spectra were binned using the grppha tool to have a minimum of 20 counts per spectral bin .",
    "we fitted the spectral data in xspec v.12.6 using powerlaw based models and phenomenological thermal models , which are typically used for modelling ulx spectra .",
    "we tabulated these best fitting spectral parameters to table [ tab : bestfits ] and the quoted errors correspond to the 90 per cent confidence level for a single parameter .",
    "as many of the spectral parameters in these models are similar , we first introduce them here .",
    "we used a constant parameter to account for possible cross - calibration uncertainties between the three epic instruments .",
    "we fixed this parameter to unity for epic - pn , and allowed mos1 and mos2 normalizations to vary .",
    "for the 2004 data , the constant parameter values were @xmath23 and @xmath24 for epic - mos1 and mos2 , respectively , and for the 2010 data they were @xmath25 and @xmath26 , independent of the spectral models used .",
    "we used the tbabs model to account for the interstellar absorption using @xcite abundances , parametrized by the column density @xmath27 .",
    "the powerlaw model is determined by the photon index @xmath28 and its normalization @xmath29 .",

    "an extension to the diskbb model , the so called `` p - free '' model diskpbb , is determined by the inner disc temperature @xmath41 , normalization @xmath42 and the `` @xmath43-parameter '' , that describes the radial dependence of the disc temperature as @xmath44 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the standard diskbb model @xmath45 , while @xmath46 for super - eddington ( slim ) accretion discs with or without outflows ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also used a comptonization model comptt , that has four parameters ; the seed photon temperature for comptonization @xmath47 , electron temperature @xmath48 , optical depth @xmath49 and normalization @xmath50 .",
    "the crude estimation of the spectral hardness for the 2010 data ( using x - ray colours in the 0.32 kev and 210 kev bands ) in fig . [ fig : pn_lc_hr ] indicates that the spectral shape remains constant during the observation even though the flux decays by @xmath1050 per cent . as such short term flux variations of ulxs",
    "are not so commonly observed , we attempted to model this by splitting the observation into `` high '' and `` low '' flux parts as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn_lc_hr ] .",
    "however , the only confident conclusion from this analysis was that the spectral shape remains constant ( see table [ tab : bestfits ] and fig [ fig : spectra]a ) .",
    "in all the models we used the parameter variations are so subtle that the parameter errors do not permit clear and significant conclusions to be made .",
    "we therefore used the time - averaged spectrum to study which phenomenological models provide the best fits to the spectral data .",
    "we started our spectral analysis of the 2010 data with the simplest absorbed powerlaw model , and found that the photon index @xmath51 ( see fig .",

    "we instead find the break at @xmath278 kev .",
    "we can thus see that , at higher than 90 per cent confidence level , the spectral break in the 2010 data occurs at a lower energy than in the higher luminosity state  observation of 2004 .",
    "another interesting difference between the 2004 and 2010 spectra is the temperature increase of the cool thermal component with increasing luminosity .",
    "however , this trend is highly model dependent , to a point where it all together disappears when using the diskbb + comptt model .",
    "if the trend is real , it is clearly different from several ulxs where an inverse relation between the temperature and luminosity has been detected @xcite .",
    "the 2002 low / soft state observation of  also deviates from these trends @xcite , which raises an interesting question .",
    "if the cool thermal component is associated with the outflow , the correlation between temperature and the luminosity seems to contradict the model prediction of @xcite developed for highly super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "this might indicate a more complicated accretion disc structure at a mildly super - eddington state and that our current understanding of ulxs is far from complete .",
    "also , it is very likely that the phenomenological models we use to model ulx spectra are oversimplified , and they do not describe the complex nature of super - eddington accretion flows accurately enough .",
    "the fact that the temperature of the cool component depends so strongly on the other model components is a stark reminder that it is necessary to know the mechanisms that produce the harder emission above @xmath275 kev before we can address the nature of the soft spectral component .",
    "in the 2010  observation of , we have detected a significant spectral break at @xmath279 kev . by comparing this to an earlier  observation taken in 2004 , where a break has been detected at @xmath280 kev @xcite",
    ", we see that in this low flux state , the break occurs at a lower energy .",
    "we found in our analysis that the spectral break might not be caused by a low temperature corona as was suggested by the previous studies @xcite .",
    "instead , the spectrum  and the spectral break  can be modelled with a hot , advective slim disc model , with a contribution from an optically thick outflow radiating at energies below 2 kev . the flux@xmath32 correlation in",
    "can therefore be related to advection in the disc ; the spectral break moves to higher energies as the mass accretion rate increases .",
    "this behaviour is also seen when spectra of other ulxs are fitted with hot disc models ; the inner disc temperatures seem to increase with increasing luminosities @xcite and in fact even some ulx spectra can also be fitted with an advective disc model ( including holmberg ix x-1 , @xcite , see below ) .",
    "furthermore , the central parts of advective super - eddington accretion discs can `` overheat '' and the colour correction factor ( and therefore the colour temperature ) can be very large close to the black hole @xcite . also , according to this model , the colour temperature is a strong function of the viscosity parameter @xmath281 ( @xcite ) .",
    "small changes in @xmath281 could , therefore , cause the colour temperature to increase so that the spectral curvature could even move beyond the spectral range of .",
    "this mechanism could possibly explain the very high inner disc temperatures that have been detected in some ulxs @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the flux@xmath32 trend seems to be different to the ulx in holmberg ix , where @xcite has reported opposite behaviour ( see however @xcite , who come to a different conclusion using the same data ) .",
    "@xcite attributes the flux@xmath32 anti - correlation in holmberg ix ulx to increased accretion disc winds as the luminosity increases .",
    "they argue that the wind increases material in the corona , which in their view causes the ( unknown ) acceleration mechanism to share the energy among an increasing amount of particles , leading to a smaller equilibrium electron temperature .",
    "this mechanism could produce the trend of the break energy being anti - correlated with the observed flux , although clearly this trend does not always hold ( see @xcite ) . however , the detected flux@xmath32 correlation in  suggest that this mechanism is unlikely to be present in this particular case",
    ". we can speculate that in holmberg ix ulx the flux@xmath32 anti - correlation might instead be related to the outflow .",
    "if the outflows are intermittent @xcite  such that they can be replaced by stronger advection and weaker outflows  the hotter inner part of the accretion disc could either be visible or obscured , thus causing the spectral break to appear at different energies . on the other hand , this opposite flux@xmath32 trend might also be related to the accretion flow properties .",
    "if small variations in the @xmath281 parameter can be unrelated to changes in the mass accretion rate , then the colour correction factor can vary considerably independently of the luminosity .",
    "such variations can , in principle , also cause the spectral break to appear at different energies , and effectively eliminate any flux@xmath32 trend .",
    "what seems necessary is that we need at least three ingredients to explain the spectral properties of ulxs in the stmbh scenario ; outflows / winds , advection and coronae above the disc .",
    "obviously , by permutating all these components in the spectral modelling we can explain the data , but real understanding of the processes require good understanding of the underlying trends .",
    "discovery of such trends requires , however , frequent monitoring programs of ulxs with deep  exposures similar to /xrt monitoring ( @xcite ) .  observations are needed especially to increase spectral sensitivity at energies closer to 10 kev , to detect the spectral curvature / breaks . these trends ( if they are confirmed ) could then be used to compare with predictions from simulations of super - eddington accretion discs @xcite to infer the accretion flow properties .",
    "alternatively , by analysing a large sample of high quality  spectra of different ulxs , one might be able to infer these trends .",
    "however , if different ulxs show different flux@xmath32 trends ( as these results seem to indicate ) , such attempt might not yield much information about these spectral features . furthermore , if some ulxs are imbhs while others are perhaps super - eddington stmbhs any possible luminosity@xmath32 trend ( or the lack of it ) might not be visible in the whole ulx population .",
    "we have performed spectral analysis of an  observation of  taken in 2010 during its low / soft state . the observed flux decayed roughly by @xmath1050 per cent during the observation .",
    "we found that the spectral shape did not change significantly during the flux decay .",
    "the spectrum itself was complex , showing a soft excess and a high energy curvature / break .",
    "the spectral data could be best fitted with a model consisting of a black body plus a cutoff powerlaw model .",
    "the cutoff powerlaw model could also be replaced with a slim disc model .    by comparing the spectral break energy @xmath32 to earlier  data taken in 2004",
    ", we could determine that @xmath32 is correlated with the observed flux .",
    "we note that this behaviour is opposite to that in holmberg ix ulx , where anti - correlation between @xmath32 and flux has been claimed .",
    "we speculate that the reason for the apparent difference could be that in  the corona is replaced with a slim accretion disc , when the system is only mildly above the eddington limit .",
    "alternatively , this difference might arise from different geometries of the outflow and the inner parts of the accretion discs in these two ulxs .",
    "clearly these results are tentative and to better understand the nature of the spectral curvature / breaks and its flux dependence additional data spanning a much larger bandpass are required .",
    "thus , repeated simultaneous observations with  and the upcoming _ nustar _ mission ( with a combined bandpass of 0.380 kev ) could help to clarify the differences and the observed trends .",
