    "since their discovery more than 40 years ago , pulsars have proven to be incredibly useful and precise astrophysical laboratories , due in large part to our ability to time their exceptionally steady rotations .",
    "in particular , by timing a pulsar in orbit with a binary companion , we learn not only about the pulsar , but about the companion and how it affects the pulsar s orbit and radiation .",
    "this provides a unique method for probing properties of both the pulsar and the companion .    of the @xmath3170 radio pulsars known to be members of binary systems ,",
    "so far only four have been found whose companion is a main - sequence star .",
    "psr b1259@xmath063 orbits a type b2e companion @xcite , and psr j0045@xmath07319 has a b1v companion @xcite .",
    "the discovery of psr j1638@xmath04725 was reported by @xcite and was a result of the parkes multibeam survey for pulsars @xcite ; its companion spectral type has not yet been determined .",
    "psr j1740@xmath03052 , discovered by @xcite in the same survey , orbits a companion that has been identified as most likely a late o - type or early b - type star @xcite .",
    "a coincident late - type star has been shown not to be the companion @xcite .",
    "the pulsar has an orbital period of 231 days , spin period 570 ms , and characteristic age 0.35 myr .    in this paper",
    ", we present an updated timing model for psr j1740@xmath03052 using more than a decade of data collected at several observatories .",
    "these observations are outlined in section [ sec : datareduc ] , along with the updated timing model and an analysis of scattering and dispersion caused by a wind from the companion .",
    "we see that dispersion - measure ( dm ) variations agree very well with those predicted by a simple stellar wind velocity model . in section",

    "individual pulses are folded at the predicted topocentric pulse period to produce pulse profiles with high signal - to - noise .",

    "the dfb polarisations are summed to form total - intensity profiles before obtaining pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) .",
    "to obtain toas , a gaussian standard profile is first constructed from a fit to high signal - to - noise data from each different instrument , and for the various frequency ranges on each instrument , using the program @xcite .",
    "data with minimal scattering are used where possible , and is used to fit out the effects of scattering if necessary .",
    "each pulse profile is cross - correlated with the appropriate standard profile to produce a topocentric toa .",
    "data observed at low frequencies show significant scattering , particularly at frequencies @xmath71  ghz .",
    "this is seen as a decaying exponential tail convolved with the pulse profile , as seen in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the program ( written by mk ) can be used to read in scattered pulse profiles along with a gaussian standard profile and output both toas that account for the shifted peak induced by the convolution and scattering timescales .",
    "we believe the scattering timescales found by the fits to be reasonable estimates . however , the toas produced using are less reliable than toas that do not account for scattering , and are not ultimately used in the full timing solution , as discussed in the next section .",
    "toas are processed using the pulsar timing software , with barycentric corrections applied using the jet propulsion laboratory de405 solar system ephemeris @xcite and clock corrections applied using the utc(nist ) timescale .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the toas input into tend to be underestimates , and thus we increase the error on sets of data from different observatories and in different frequency ranges such that each set has a reduced @xmath8 of @xmath31 .",
    "the 1@xmath9 errors on parameters output by are also doubled , providing error estimates we consider to be conservative .",
    "-produced toas are used for the lower - frequency data which have scattering tails that are quite long , as discussed in section [ sec : scattering ] , but we find that it makes no significant difference to the parameter values or reduced @xmath8 of the fit ( prior to error - scaling ) for toas with frequency @xmath101  ghz and only serves to reduce their correlation with higher - frequency residuals that do not show scattering .",
    "for this reason , we do not use toas for data at frequencies @xmath101  ghz , which are the toas used in the full timing solution .",
    "variations in dispersion measure ( dm ) near periastron were detected by @xcite and taken as evidence for a wind from a nondegenerate companion .",
    "the wind velocity model of @xcite and references therein is used there to support the idea that the companion is an early b - type star rather than a late - type supergiant .",
    "variations in dm in this model can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass - loss rate of the companion in m@xmath13  yr@xmath14 and @xmath15 is the ratio of the wind velocity at infinity to the escape velocity , expected to be in the range 13 .",
    "@xmath16 is the integral along the line of sight to the pulsar from infinity , given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 the radius of the companion and @xmath19 the distance from the centre of mass of the star .",
    "we use this model to investigate offsets in dm over the entire orbit of the binary system given orbital parameters determined through timing and integrating numerically through the wind along the line of sight to the pulsar .",
    "we calculate dm offsets by looking at four consecutive orbits ( mjd 52046 to 52971 ) that have data spanning multiple well - separated frequencies and binning the toas into groups with multiple frequencies where possible , with lengths of five days or fewer .",
    "we run with dm arbitrarily fixed at 738.5  @xmath6  pc , allowing dm offsets to vary independently in each bin .",
    "the error bars are doubled , and , using the pymc markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm @xcite , we fit these offsets to the wind - model predictions . the orbital inclination angle is varied as a free parameter in order to find a best fit . from the inclination angle and the assumption of a 1.4  m@xmath13 pulsar , the companion s mass",
    "is calculated using the binary mass function , and this in turn is used to estimate the companion s radius , @xmath18 .",
    "this is done by interpolating over the relevant range of main - sequence masses in table 15.8 of @xcite .",
    "along with the inclination angle , we vary the quantity @xmath20 in equation [ eqn : dmoffs ] ( equivalent to scaling the height of the curve in figure [ fig : dmscatter ] ) and the baseline of the dm offsets ( shifting the vertical position of the curve ) .",
    "the results of this fit are shown in the first two panels of figure [ fig : dmscatter ] , with best fits of @xmath21  degrees , @xmath22  m@xmath13  yr@xmath14 , and 0.41@xmath23  @xmath6  pc for the orbital inclination , the quantity @xmath20 , and the dm baseline offset , respectively .",
    "@xcite have measured a neutron star mass of 2  m@xmath13 , and so we also ran the mcmc code assuming a pulsar mass of 2.0  m@xmath13 .",
    "all fit parameters were consistent within the error bars of the results listed above , and so we continue to assume a pulsar mass of 1.4  m@xmath13 .    3052 system , both as a function of mjd and orbital phase . the orbital inclination determined by this fit is @xmath24 degrees .",

    "the bottom panel shows average scattering timescales of bcpm data observed at 1190 mhz varying across orbital phase .",
    "the data have been binned so that each point represents five measurements , except for the final point before phase zero , which represents four .",
    "note the increase in scattering near the phase of maximum dm , at which we expect the beam of the pulsar to traverse more of the companion s wind than elsewhere along the orbit .",
    "in all panels , dotted vertical lines denote periastron . ]",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig : dmscatter ] that the model and observations agree well .",
    "the fit has a reduced @xmath8 of 1.04 .",
    "using all three output fit parameters , we numerically calculate a predicted dm offset for each toa .",
    "these offsets are applied to all toas in to remove the effects of a varying dm from the timing residuals , even for epochs with only single - frequency observations .",
    "we can use the fit parameters to estimate some further quantities . using the inclination angle obtained through this fit , and assuming a pulsar mass of 1.4  m@xmath13",
    ", we estimate the mass of the companion to be 20@xmath25  m@xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the early main - sequence star hypothesis of @xcite , and with the isochrones plotted in figure 3 of @xcite for a main - sequence companion younger than 10  myr , which fits with the pulsar s characteristic age of 0.35  myr .    allowing a @xmath15 value in the range 13 ,",
    "our measurement of @xmath20 gives a mass - loss rate in the range ( 0.63)@xmath26  m@xmath13  yr@xmath14 for the companion , assuming a completely ionized wind . while this is lower than models predict for radiatively - driven winds by at least an order of magnitude ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some galactic late o - type main - sequence stars have in recent years been observed to have unexpectedly low mass - loss rates in just this range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is known as the ` weak - wind problem ' .",
    "the cause of these weak winds is not established , but models that initiate winds using line acceleration in addition to radiative acceleration do appear to reproduce the weak - wind problem for late o - type stars @xcite . whatever the cause , unless the wind is only partially ionized , it appears as though the companion to psr j1740@xmath03052 may experience this phenomenon .",
    "the baseline offset is best interpreted in conjunction with the dm measured by , and so we withhold discussion of this parameter until the next section .    finally , we find evidence for orbital variations not only in dm , but in the scattering timescale of pulses . in the third panel of figure",
    "[ fig : dmscatter ] we plot scattering timescales for 1190  mhz data as a function of orbital phase , binned to increase signal - to - noise .",
    "it is clear that the amount of scatter increases where the pulses must traverse more of the stellar wind , which is the same phase at which the dm variations peak in the previous panel .",

    "the dm value output by represents the baseline from which our orbital - phase - dependent dm offsets are measured , and this allows us to estimate how much of the dm is due to the interstellar medium ( ism ) rather than the companion s wind .",
    "we expect it to be close to the arbitrary value of 738.5  @xmath6  pc we used as a baseline when determining the offsets , but there is no reason it should be the same , as we are now applying a model dm offset to our entire set of toas .",
    "indeed , we measure 738.73(8 )  @xmath6  pc . as stated in the previous section , the theoretical curve of figure [ fig : dmscatter ]",
    "was shifted up by 0.41@xmath23  @xmath6  pc to fit the measured dm offsets , and so our offsets are too high by this amount , or equivalently , our baseline dm value is too low by this amount . adding this value , therefore , to the dm output by",
    ", we obtain a value of 739.1(2 )  @xmath6  pc , which is an estimate of the dm resulting only from the ism .",
    "it should be noted that the companion wind s contribution should be included when observing psr j1740@xmath03052 , ideally with the orbital phase at the time of observation taken into account to dedisperse as accurately as possible .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : residuals ] that there remain some unmodelled systematics in our timing residuals , particularly a prominent quasi - periodic signal that is present in data acquired at various frequencies and observatories .",
    "figure [ fig : res_f4 ] shows a segment of the residuals for a fit using only four spin derivatives , rather than ten , to emphasize that we do not think these remaining systematics are merely an artefact caused by fitting out a high - order polynomial . using a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite , we measure the period of this signal to be 1.40@xmath66 years , or 2.22@xmath67 orbital periods , where the error bars are taken as the change in frequency ( subsequently converted to period ) required to reach half the peak value on the periodogram . this signal will be discussed further below .",

    "yr@xmath14 measured by @xcite , though they are consistent within twice the latter s 1@xmath9 error bars . following the calculation in equation 2 of that paper , but with @xmath70m@xmath13 and @xmath71m@xmath13 , general relativity predicts an advance of @xmath72  yr@xmath14 .",
    "this is approximately double the value measured here , suggesting that there is a counteracting classical contribution due to a mass quadrupole .",
    "conversely , if we assume our measured @xmath1 to be due entirely to general relativity , we can determine the total mass of the system using this value along with the measured orbital period and eccentricity .",
    "this provides a 3@xmath9 upper limit of 7.3  m@xmath13 , which is considerably smaller than the 8.7  m@xmath13 binary mass function .",
    "thus , without a counteracting classical contribution , we would require a _ negative _ pulsar mass .",
    "@xcite show that for a b - type main sequence star companion , a mass quadrupole due to tidal effects is negligible compared to a spin - induced quadrupole .",
    "following their methods , we find that the classical contribution to @xmath1 is approximately @xmath73  yr@xmath14 .",
    "using this and our measurement of the rate of change of the projected semi - major axis @xmath2 , for which there was previously only an upper limit , we find a greater angle between spin and orbital angular momentum vectors in the companion than was previously estimated .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : wexdiagram ] , which uses the model of @xcite , the companion s spin momentum differs by 40@xmath4887@xmath48 from being either aligned or anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary system .",
    "such a large relative tilt would likely have been induced by an asymmetry or ` kick ' in the supernova explosion that created the pulsar @xcite . making the assumption that the angular momenta in the pre - supernova system were aligned and that the orbit was circular @xcite",
    ", we find the kick velocity was at least 50  km / s .",
    "a known alternative mechanism for producing secular changes in @xmath2 and @xmath1 arises simply from the change in viewing geometry due to the proper motion of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "proper motion has not been measured in our system , but we can easily see that this effect may be disregarded . a transverse speed of 500  km / s , absurdly high for such a massive system , leads to a motion of about 10  mas / yr at the estimated distance of 11  kpc .",
    "this would contribute at most @xmath74  deg  yr@xmath14 to @xmath1 and @xmath75 to @xmath2 . comparing with our measured values in table [ tbl : timing ] or with the classical contribution to @xmath1 above , we see that this effect falls short of our measurements by an order of magnitude or more in each case .",
    "thus , we consider it no further .",
    "the distribution of angles shown in figure [ fig : wexdiagram ] leads to a 3@xmath9 lower limit of @xmath76  au@xmath77 on the quadrupole moment @xmath78 of the companion .",
    "this is determined by allowing @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the inclination angle to vary by 3@xmath9 and finding the allowed combination of angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 that minimizes @xmath78 in the equations of @xcite .",
    "this can not place an upper limit on @xmath78 , but a monte carlo sampling of the parameter space gives a median value that is only about twice the lower limit at @xmath81  au@xmath77 , assuming a uniform distribution over the orbital - plane precession angle @xmath80 . taking this median @xmath78 , companion mass 20  m@xmath13 and a stellar radius of 8  r@xmath13 determined by interpolating a standard table of main - sequence masses and radii @xcite , we can use equation 6 of @xcite to estimate roughly the stellar spin period @xmath82 .",
    "we find @xmath83  s , which remains consistent with the value assumed by @xcite .    , and",
    "the angle between the main - sequence star s spin and orbital angular momenta , @xmath79 , given the masses of the two stars and the inclination angle of the system .",
    "the grey regions are excluded because @xmath2 is positive and the hatched regions are excluded because the classical contribution to @xmath1 is negative . because the inclination angle is by far the dominant source of error , the solid lines are drawn assuming the nominal measured values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "if the spin and orbital angular momenta are closer to being aligned than anti - aligned , we find that @xmath84 , with @xmath79 close to @xmath85 for most values of @xmath80 . otherwise , we may subtract these angles from @xmath86 .",
    "after wex 1998 , figure 11 . ]",
    "the source of the 2.2@xmath41 signal in the timing residuals is not known . for the sake of interest ,",
    "we imagine a third body orbiting the pulsar - main - sequence binary system with this period . as a simple approximation",
    ", we treat the binary system as a single body of mass @xmath87  m@xmath13 located at its centre of mass in a circular orbit with a planet .",
    "we also assume the inclination of this orbit to be the same as that for the binary system , which we fixed at 53@xmath48 .",
    "we find that in such an approximation , given the uncertainties in inclination angle , main - sequence star mass , and the amplitude of the signal ( which we estimate to be anywhere from slightly less than 1  ms to 2  ms ) , a planet would be 28 earth masses , orbiting at a radius of 34  au .",
    "given the inclination angle , the semimajor axis of the inner binary is @xmath88  au , with a maximum separation of @xmath89  au .",
    "a circumbinary planet thus seems unlikely at such a short distance , making this rough approximation unappealing .",
    "@xcite have run simulations to test the stability of circumbinary orbits .",
    "the results of those simulations suggest that a system with the eccentricity and mass ratio of j1740@xmath03052 could not host a stable circumbinary orbit closer than roughly 5 times the semimajor axis of the binary ( e.g.  figure 14 of that paper ) .",
    "furthermore , a planet orbiting only the pulsar with this period would be at roughly the same distance as the companion star , which is untenable .",
    "a more satisfying explanation would be one that does not invoke an additional orbiting body .",
    "if it were some consequence of the companion s spin , we would expect a much shorter period , as main - sequence stars rotate with periods on the order of days , not years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* table 15.8 ) .",
    "in particular , in section [ sec : secularchanges ] above , we estimated the spin period of the companion to be only a few days .",
    "@xcite explain such a ` superorbital ' period in eclipsing pulsar binary psr b1957@xmath9020 by variations in the quadrupole moment induced by tidal activity .",
    "the far greater separation and companion mass in the psr j1740@xmath03052 system make this seem a very unlikely mechanism for the observed variations , as well as our assumption in the previous section that tidal effects are small in this system .",
    "the orbit of the pulsar being tilted at least 40@xmath48 and perhaps close to 90@xmath48 from the spin of the companion would further reduce the effectiveness of such a mechanism .",
    "if the companion is a be star , as in the case of psr b1259@xmath063 @xcite , its circumstellar disk may be tilted due to the misalignment of the star s spin and orbital angular momenta , and might thus be expected to precess ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a precessing disk would introduce a new source of periodicity into the system that might explain the observed variations .",
    "@xcite suggest that the b - star binary psr j0045@xmath07319 should show oscillations on a timescale of about a year if a disk is periodically ejected , and the same might apply to j1740@xmath03052 .",
    "evidence of a disk around the companion star ( such as hydrogen emission lines ) would put constraints on such a scenario in our system .",
    "we have updated the @xcite timing model for psr j1740@xmath03052 using data acquired on several instruments . from the timing results , we see orbital - phase variations in the scattering and dispersion of the pulsar s radio beam that are clear indicators of a stellar wind coming from its massive companion , lending further support to the pulsar - main - sequence binary picture for this system .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion - measure variations fit very well to a simple radiative stellar wind model for the charged - particle column density .",
    "the mass - loss rate derived from this fit is lower than predicted by models , but matches the rates observed in some late o - type main - sequence stars found in the galaxy in recent years .",
    "this weak - wind problem remains an area of active current research .",
    "if the companion of psr j1740@xmath03052 is indeed such a star , then its spectral class is presumably late o - type rather than early b - type .    with our new timing solution ,",
    "we are able to measure the derivative of the projected semi - major axis @xmath2 , which leads to new constraints on the geometry of the binary system  the pulsar s orbit appears to be tilted substantially from being aligned ( or anti - aligned ) with the companion s spin .",
    "this tilt of the orbital plane was likely caused by asymmetries in the supernova explosion that produced the pulsar , implying a kick of at least @xmath350  km / s .",
    "the origin of the quasi - periodic 2.2@xmath41 signal seen in the timing residuals of figure [ fig : residuals ] is a mystery .",
    "@xcite suggest that spectroscopic observations of the companion could be made with the aid of adaptive optics , further constraining the orbital parameters and spectral class of the star .",
    "such constraints might narrow down the possible mechanisms for producing this signal , particularly if evidence is found for a circumstellar disk .",
    "finally , considering the winds of both the pulsar and its main - sequence companion , we might expect a shock front between the two to produce emission at x - ray and gamma - ray energies in this binary system .",
    "high - energy emission has been observed in association with the pulsar - main - sequence binary b1259@xmath063 @xcite and the millisecond pulsar b1957@xmath9020 @xcite , in both cases attributed to a shocked pulsar wind . @xcite",
    "examined archival x - ray observations in the field of psr j1740@xmath03052 and found no significant emission , but were unable to rule out the existence of shock emission .",
    "psr  j1740@xmath03052 is one of just a few systems that represents a particular early stage in the evolution of binary systems containing neutron stars .",
    "most such binaries presumably begin as a pair of massive main - sequence stars and pass through a relatively brief phase during which one has evolved to form a neutron star , while the other still burns hydrogen in its core .",
    "not only does this strengthen our models of binary evolution ; as seen here , it provides a unique means of probing the wind and gravitational properties of a main - sequence star .",
