    "` penguin ` solves the same equations as in @xcite , except in this paper all simulations are done in 3d , and with different input parameters .",
    "we provide some details here .",
    "we use @xmath11 to denote the usual radial , azimuthal , and polar coordinates , and @xmath12 for the cylindrical radius .",
    "the lagrangian continuity and momentum equations solved by ` penguin ` are : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gas density , @xmath15 the velocity field , @xmath16 the gas pressure , @xmath17 the newtonian stress tensor , and @xmath18 the combined gravitational potential of the star and the companion .",

    "the somewhat larger scale height for the @xmath1 model is motivated by the recent fits to hd  100453 @xcite , and also provides a contrast to the @xmath0 model .",
    "the initial velocity field assumes hydrostatic equilibrium taking into account gas pressure , but neglecting viscosity . as a result ,",
    "the initial disk has zero radial and polar velocities , and an orbital frequency of : @xmath67    both the inner and outer radial boundaries are fixed at their initial values . for the polar boundaries , we enforce symmetry at the midplane since we only simulate the upper half of the disk , and use a reflecting condition at the top to prevent mass from entering the simulation domain .",
    "additionally , a wave killing zone is imposed next to the top boundary to remove reflections .",
    "the prescription for this wave killing zone is : @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the fluid variable @xmath14 , @xmath16 , or @xmath15 , @xmath70 is the polar angle at the top boundary , and @xmath71 is the width of the killing zone , which is @xmath72 for the @xmath35 model and @xmath73 for @xmath7 .",
    "technically , this killing zone results in a continuous loss of disk mass , but since the top boundary is located about 5 scale heights above the midplane , the loss is negligible over the timescale of our simulations .",
    "the density distributions obtained in our hydro simulations are post - processed via 3d mcrt calculations using the @xcite code to produce synthetic nir images .",
    "this process largely follows the procedures described in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "these separations are also in the same range as the distances to the ( predicted ) companions in sao 206462 , mwc 758 , and hd 100453 .",

    "to @xmath81 the grid has 50 cells in @xmath78 with logarithmic spacing , while from @xmath81 to @xmath80 the grid is identical to the corresponding hydro simulation .",
    "since hydro simulations produce disk density structures in gas , while nir images are determined by the distribution of dust in disks , we need to convert gas density structures into dust density structures .",
    "the dust grains are assumed to be interstellar medium ( ism ) grains @xcite made of silicate , graphite , and amorphous carbon .",
    "their size distribution obeys a smooth power law up to a grain radius of 0.25  @xmath82 followed by an exponential cut off at larger sizes .",
    "the optical properties of the dust grains can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) . from @xmath81 to @xmath80 , the dust volume density , @xmath83 , is assumed to be linearly proportional to the gas volume density , @xmath84 .",
    "this is appropriate as these sub-@xmath82-sized particles are dynamically well coupled to the gas . between @xmath79 and @xmath81 , @xmath83 at @xmath85",
    "is assumed to be the same as @xmath83 at @xmath86 .",
    "we note that this inner disk is introduced in the mcrt simulations simply to fill in the central cavity of the hydro simulations . removing this inner disk leads to a @xmath87 increase in the surface brightness of the resultant image , but does not alter our reported outer disk morphologies .",
    "the total ism dust disk mass within 100 au is normalized to @xmath88 in both models .",
    "this corresponds to , for example , a total gas disk mass of 0.01  @xmath89 , a 100:1 gas - to - dust mass ratio , a @xmath34 dust mass fraction in the small ism grains , and a remaining 90% mass fraction in the large grains that are presumed to have settled to the disk midplane and do not affect nir scattering .",

    "in addition , the following polar - coordinate stokes parameters are defined @xcite : @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath76 is the position angle of a point ( north to east ) in a disk image . by construction",
    ", @xmath104 contains the polarization components in the tangential ( azimuthal ) and radial directions , while @xmath105 contains the components at @xmath106 with respect to that .",
    "if the disk scattering surface is perpendicular to the line of sight ( this is approximately true for geometrically thin disks viewed face - on ) and observed photons are mostly produced by single - scattering events , only the tangential polarization component exists , and @xmath104 is equivalent to pi ( except unlike pi , @xmath104 can be both positive and negative ) .",
    "in such cases , @xmath105 is expected to contain little signal and is often used to estimate the noise level @xcite . for inclined disks ( for which the scattering angle is often not @xmath107 ) and/or images built up of multiply scattered photons ( as is the case for disks surrounded by an envelope ) , polarization may not be purely tangential , and @xmath105 can contain non - trivial signal as well @xcite .",
    "this issue has been recently investigated by @xcite , and will be discussed in section  [ sec : results_arms ] .",
    "the orientation of the disk inclination is indicated by a pair of parameters ( pa,@xmath108 ) , where pa is the position angle of the disk major axis ( north - to - east ; pa@xmath109 when the west side of the disk is the nearside ) and @xmath108 is the inclination ( @xmath41 is face - on and @xmath107 is edge - on ) .",
    "the images emerging from the mcrt pipeline are convolved by a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath110 at @xmath97-band , @xmath111 at @xmath98-band , @xmath112 at @xmath99-band , and @xmath113 at @xmath100-band .",

    "in this section , we present the morphology of the spiral arms in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 models , and the morphology of the gap in the @xmath0 model ( in the @xmath1 model the disk is effectively truncated to a circumprimary disk ) , over the full range of viewing angles .",
    "our hydro simulations settle into quasi - steady states after about 10 orbits , and the morphology of the arms remains practically the same afterwards , as shown in figure  [ fig : image_100mj_orbits ] .",
    "the definitions of various geometrical terms used in this paper , including the disk s pa ; its `` top '' ( illuminated ) and `` bottom '' ( obscured ) halves ; and its `` nearside '' and `` farside , '' are illustrated in figure  [ fig : image_geometry ] .",
    "we use a `` red - hot '' color scheme for the scattered light images and a greyscale scheme for other plots .",
    "unless stated otherwise , all mcrt images are convolved polarized intensity images at @xmath99-band ( angular resolution @xmath112 ; we also examined the arm morphologies at @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100-bands , and found them indistinguishable ) ; the central @xmath114 in radius is masked out to mimic a coronagraph ; the star is marked by a white @xmath115 ; the nearside of the disk is indicated by a white asterisk on the minor axis ; and the projected location of the companion is indicated by an open green circle ( the absence of the green circle implies that the companion is outside the field of view ) .",

    "our color scheme is chosen to bring out all features above this noise floor .",
    "we also experimented with varying the total disk dust mass @xmath118 by 1 order of magnitude around our fiducial value , and did not find any noticeable change in our results . since different frequency bands and @xmath118 values probe scattering surfaces of different altitudes , this insensitivity suggests that the positions of the arms are largely independent of altitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : basic ] shows the surface density maps and face - on images ( both full resolution and convolved ) for both models .",
    "the companion in both cases excites two spiral shocks inside its orbit , which manifest themselves as arms in scattered light images , as seen in previous works @xcite .",
    "we will label as primary ( `` p '' ) the arm pointing towards the companion ; the other arm is secondary ( `` s '' ) .",
    "the two arms in the stellar mass companion case are in a near @xmath3 rotational symmetry . in the planetary companion case ,",
    "the arms are @xmath116@xmath119 apart , consistent with the relation found by @xcite .",
    "also , because of the smaller scale height in the @xmath0 model , the spiral arms in that model are less open than in the @xmath1 model .",
    "the loci of the arms are marked in figure  [ fig : image_locus ] .",
    "the @xmath0 planet opens a gap from 75 to 130 au .",
    "both the inner disk , which harbors the prominent inner arms , and the outer disk ring are visible in scattered light .",
    "the planet also excites two arms in the outer disk ring ; however they are faint because of their large distance from the star , and they are difficult to distinguish because they are tightly wound @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the inner arms as they are most likely to be observable .    in the @xmath1 model ,",
    "the powerful tidal force of the companion truncates the disk to about half its orbital radius ( 100  au ) , leaving behind two separate components  a circumprimary disk and a circumsecondary disk .",
    "we note that the circumsecondary disk also has a pair of mini - arms excited by the primary star ; however , since the companion is not an illumination source , this mini - disk is not visible in scattered light ( it is shadowed from the primary star by the circumprimary disk ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry ] , [ fig : image_100mj_geometry_big ] , and [ fig : image_3mj_geometry ] show synthetic @xmath99-band images for the two models at various viewing angles ( figure  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry_big ] is a zoomed - out version of figure  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry ] that shows the location of the companion ) . for the @xmath0 model",
    ", we view the disk at 7 inclination angles from @xmath120 ( at @xmath121 disk images are very similar to face - on ; see figure  [ fig : basic ] ) to @xmath122 ( top to bottom ) ; at each inclination the disk is oriented at 12 pas covering the entire @xmath40 . in total , @xmath123 images of different viewing angles are shown . for the @xmath1 model , because the two arms are nearly rotation - symmetric , at each inclination we show the disk at 6 pas covering @xmath124 in the azimuthal direction ( the other @xmath124 is redundant ) , and thus , in total , @xmath125 images of different viewing angles are shown",
    ".    the distortion of the arms introduced by a non - face - on viewing angle can be dramatic .",
    "in general , the portion of the arms on the nearside of the disk gradually moves towards the major axis as the inclination increases .",
    "this can be seen at all position angles , and is best illustrated when an entire arm is on the nearside ( e.g. , from top to bottom in the pa@xmath109 column in figure  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry ] , and from top to bottom in the pa@xmath126 and @xmath127 columns in figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry ] ) .",
    "this behavior is expected when viewing a bowl - shaped surface at an angle .",
    "the distortions as seen on the farside of the disk are less dramatic , until the disk reaches very high inclination ( @xmath128 ) and the entire top half becomes a bowl viewed edge - on . because of the distortions generated by finite inclinations , what appear as two trailing arms on two sides of the disk in face - on images may appear to be ( 1 ) just one arm ; ( 2 ) two trailing arms on one side of the disk ; or ( 3 ) two arms on one side winding in opposite directions .",
    "these possibilities are summarized in figure  [ fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] , which shows the @xmath1 model at four viewing angles .    at inclinations",
    "lower than @xmath129 , the disk s bottom half is too faint to detect ( its emission is less than three times the noise level in current observations ) . as the disk becomes more inclined , the nearside of its bottom half , separated from the top half by the dark lane at the disk midplane , brightens . in the @xmath1 model , because there is no outer disk to block the spiral arms , one or both arms can be seen on the disk s bottom half depending on the position angle .",
    "this is best illustrated by comparing the first and fourth columns of figure  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry_big ] . in the @xmath0 model , only the outer disk ring can be seen on the bottom half , as the outer disk blocks the inner disk .",
    "therefore the bottom half remains symmetric about the minor axis , regardless of position angle .",
    "@xmath104 , @xmath105 , and polarization fractions for various viewing angles are shown in figure  [ fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] , along with ti and pi images .",
    "pi and @xmath104 are nearly identical in all cases , and aside from a difference in normalization , both resemble the ti images . while the face - on @xmath105 contains little signal and represents noise in our mcrt simulations , at high inclinations there is some signal in @xmath105 ( particularly in the bright inner disk close to the model coronagraph edge ) , which shows patterns symmetric about the minor axis .",
    "these findings are consistent with those by @xcite for disks viewed at modest - to - high inclination .",
    "the @xmath1 disk is truncated by the companion and thus has no outer disk , while in the @xmath0 case the planet opens a gap that separates the well - defined inner and outer disks .",
    "figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] shows pi , ti , and pf images of the entire 200-au - wide disk for the @xmath0 model at pa@xmath126 for various inclinations ( the pf images are the same as in the first column of figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry ] ) .",
    "the outer disk ring on the top half is visible in both pi and ti at all inclinations . in ti images ,",
    "scattered light is brightest on the nearside of the ring , and decreases towards the farside because of preferential forward scattering by ism dust . in pi images ,",
    "both the nearside and farside of the top half are fainter than in the ti images because of the inefficiency of polarized scattering at both small and large scattering angles ( note the two breaks on the ring along the minor axis at @xmath130 ) .",
    "the two `` wings '' along the major axis on the top half of the disk are prominent as the scattering angle is close to @xmath107 . at high inclinations",
    ", the two wings may look like two spiral arms winding in opposite directions ( as further discussed in section  [ sec : discussions_aksco ] ) .",
    "this can be further demonstrated in the right column : the pf in the two wings ( indicated by the red arrows ) at @xmath131 can reach @xmath1160.5 , while the farside of the top half and the nearside of the bottom half have pf close to 0 .",
    "the gap is traceable in both ti and pi images at @xmath132 ( at larger inclinations only the ti images show the gap ) , but leaves little imprint in the pf maps .",
    "lastly , the dark lane of the disk midplane is prominent at @xmath131 in both ti and pi , but is practically 0 in pf .",
    "figure  [ fig : image_3mj_edgeon ] shows the ti and pi images at 3 nearly edge - on viewing angles ( @xmath133 ) in a linear stretch to emphasize the structures in the outer disk ring . in all cases , clumps can be identified on the `` wings '' in both ti and pi .",
    "they are spiral arms `` collapsed '' along the line of sight .",
    "these structures will be discussed in section  [ sec : discussions_aksco ] .",
    "in resolved observations of disks , the original images are sometimes deprojected based on an estimated inclination of the system in an attempt to recover the face - on morphology of the disk , and also scaled by @xmath134 to enhance the visibility of features at large distance ( sometimes the two are combined as in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , deprojection assumes the disk surface is thin and flat ( i.e. , not curved ) , and @xmath134-scaling assumes a face - on viewing geometry .",
    "neither of these conditions is typically satisfied . to assess the degree to which conventional deprojection and scaling procedures introduce unphysical artifacts , we show in figures  [ fig : image_3mj_deproj ] and [ fig : image_100mj_deproj ] the results of deprojections and scalings .",
    "@xmath134-scaling significantly enhances the visibility of features at large projected distances , as expected .",
    "in particular , the originally faint bottom half of the disk becomes prominent , as does the ring in the outer disk in the @xmath0 model .",
    "however we note that the compensation at large radius is not entirely physical .",
    "for example , different parts of the outer disk ring in the @xmath0 model are not compensated by the same factor ( which they should be because the ring is a circle centered on the star ) because of their different projected distance @xmath78 from the center . as a result ,",
    "the ring is disproportionally enhanced along the major axis and less so along the minor axis .",
    "likewise , deprojecting an inclined image can sometimes lead to serious misinterpretation of the true morphology of the system . in the @xmath1 model , even at a modest @xmath135 inclination ( the second and third rows in figure  [ fig : image_100mj_deproj ] ) , deprojection can not restore the morphology of the two arms at a face - on viewing angle ; at @xmath136 inclination ( the last two rows ) , deprojection severely distorts the arms  it can not even recover the total number of arms .",
    "in the @xmath0 model , deprojection also fails to restore the face - on arm morphologies , although the distortion is less severe than for the @xmath1 model because the disk is flatter in the @xmath0 model ( @xmath137 ) than in the @xmath1 model ( @xmath138 ) , and because the height variations of the arms are smaller for the @xmath0 model .",
    "deprojection also can not restore the outer disk ring and the gap back to concentric circular structures  they appear to be off - centered ellipses broken along the minor axis ( the eccentricity of the ellipses is somewhat reduced compared with the original inclined images ) .",
    "lastly , it is obvious that the dark lane along the disk midplane can not be removed by deprojecting the images .",
    "it follows from these tests that the method developed by @xcite to infer the mass of a planet based on the azimuthal separation between the two arms it excites can only be applied to nearly face - on systems ( @xmath139 ) .      in this section ,",
    "we connect our models to observed disk systems .",
    "as shown in the bottom rows of figures  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry ] , [ fig : image_100mj_geometry_big ] , and [ fig : image_3mj_geometry ] , nearly edge - on disks ( @xmath140 ) with spiral arms may appear to be asymmetric about their minor axis at certain pas , as the axisymmetry of the disk is broken by the non - axisymmetric spiral arms excited by companions . in the case of a stellar mass companion , the spiral",
    "arms are big and wide , and not blocked by an outer disk ring when viewed edge - on ( since the disk is severely truncated ) ; the arms introduce global asymmetries in disks .",
    "this kind of asymmetry has been found in directly imaged nearly edge - on disks , such as the hh  30 disk inclined by @xmath141 @xcite . in the case of planet - induced spiral arms ( which are thinner ) , when viewed at certain pas they may `` collapse '' along the line of sight to produce intensity inhomogeneities in the form of clumps in edge - on disks ( figure  [ fig : image_3mj_edgeon ] ) .",
    "these clumps can be seen in ti and especially pi images . in direct imaging observations",
    ", they may mimic and be confused with point source detections . in recent gpi and sphere observations of the edge - on debris disk au mic , several clumps of unknown origin have been identified at tens of au on one side of the disk @xcite .",
    "the morphology of these clumps are reminiscent of the ones in figure  [ fig : image_3mj_edgeon ] .",
    "though our results can not be directly applied to the au mic observations as gas - poor debris disks differ in their dynamics from gas - rich protoplanetary disks , figure  [ fig : image_3mj_edgeon ] hints at a potential solution to the mystery , and warrants more specific investigation in the future .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] a planet - induced gap may be detectable in both ti and pi images at inclinations between @xmath116@xmath120 and @xmath116@xmath136 . in figure  [ fig : image_abaur ]",
    "we compare our @xmath0 model at @xmath142 with the subaru / hiciao polarized observation of ab aur @xcite .",
    "the full resolution model image is rescaled to match the size of the object ( the @xmath0 planet is now at 67 au ) , and convolved by an appropriate psf to achieve the same angular resolution as the subaru observation .",
    "the model disk has pa@xmath143 , @xmath142 ; rotates around the star in the counterclockwise direction ; and has a nearside to the southeast ; all these parameters are consistent with observations @xcite . in this paper",
    "is equivalent to pa=@xmath144 in @xcite ; there is a difference of @xmath124 between our definitions . ]",
    "the qualitative morphologies of the inner disk , the gap , and the outer disk ring resemble features seen in ab aur ; in particular , the gap at @xmath145 au appears to be deeper on the farside and shallower on the nearside because of the variation of dust scattering efficiency with scattering angle .",
    "we note that although the comparison between our model and the observations is only qualitative , the model is `` unique '' in the sense that the viewing geometry has been fixed by the observations .",
    "there are even hints of fine spiral arms in the inner disk in the subaru image , at the same locations as in the model images .",
    "we note that in the model image the morphologies of the outer ring and the gap are more - or - less independent of the position angle of the planet as they are intrinsically axisymmetric , while the details of the inner disk structures are obviously sensitive to planet location .      as shown in figures  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry][fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] , depending on the orientation of the disk , the trailing - double - arm pattern for a face - on viewing geometry may appear at other viewing angles to be one trailing arm , two trailing arms to one side , or two arms winding in opposite directions .",
    "such features have been reported in real disks , as in the single trailing arm at @xmath116130  au in the inner disk of hd 141569 a ( viewed at @xmath116@xmath146 inclination ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .5-myr - old system @xcite .",
    "] companion - induced spiral arms viewed at a large inclination may explain such an observation .",
    "intriguingly , `` spiral arms '' can be mimicked by an outer disk ring separated from the inner disk by a planetary gap when viewed at non - zero inclinations , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] . in this case ,",
    "the outer disk manifests itself as two `` pseudo - arms '' along the major axis , approximately symmetric about the minor axis , winding in opposite directions .",
    "the two arms found in recent sphere observations of ak sco @xcite may provide a real - life example . in figure",
    "[ fig : image_aksco ] , we compare a model image ( rescaled to match the size of ak sco ) with the sphere observations .",
    "the model image adopts the geometry of ak sco : the position angle of the disk in this paper is equivalent to pa=@xmath136 in @xcite ; there is a difference of @xmath124 between our definitions . ]",
    "is @xmath147 and the disk is inclined by @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "the two pseudo - arms in the model image qualitatively resemble the arms in ak sco . as was the case above for ab  aur ,",
    "the model has no free parameter regarding viewing geometry .",
    "moreover , the only remaining free parameter , the location of the planet , does not much affect the arm morphologies .",
    "experiments show that the opening angle of the pseudo - arms is determined by the inclination ( figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] ) and the disk scale height ( both the absolute value and the extent of flaring ) . for a given distance to the object , the length of the arms is set by the size of the outer disk ring ; for a fixed ring size , the width of the arms is set by the gap size determined by @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and disk viscosity @xcite , as a wider gap narrows the outer disk ring .",
    "the @xmath0 planet in our model of ak sco is located at 25 au from the star , while its azimuthal location can not be determined as the outer disk ring is approximately axisymmetric .",
    "our model makes a unique prediction for such pseudo - arms .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] , they have high polarization fractions because they scatter light at @xmath107 .",
    "given that the sphere observations in @xcite are in ti , future pi observations of ak sco can test our interpretation . also , deeper exposures can attempt to reveal the faint nearside of the bottom half of the disk , parallel to the two arms and separated by the dark midplane .",
    "the two major arms identified in the inner disk of hd 100546 at @xmath151  au in recent gpi @xcite and sphere imaging ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the  wing structure  in their fig .",
    "3 ) might also be pseudo - arms .",
    "the geometry of the disk supports this interpretation : the disk is suitably inclined by @xmath116@xmath144 , and both arms are on the farside of the major axis .",
    "the above tests outlined for ak sco also apply to hd 100546 .",
    "in this paper , we carried out 3d hydrodynamics simulations of companion - induced spiral arms and gaps in protoplanetary disks .",
    "we examined the observational signatures of these features by synthesizing direct imaging observations at near - infrared wavelengths using 3d monte carlo radiative transfer simulations .",
    "we studied two models , one with a @xmath0 planet at 100 au and another with a @xmath1 companion at 200 au ( assuming the central star is 1 @xmath89 ) , surveying the entire parameter space in viewing inclination and position angle ( figures  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry ] and [ fig : image_3mj_geometry ] ) . in the @xmath0 model",
    "the planet opens a gap and excites two prominent spiral arms in the inner disk ; the inner disk arms , the outer disk ring , and the gap are readily detected when viewed face - on ( figure  [ fig : basic ] ) .",
    "in the @xmath1 model , the companion truncates the circumprimary disk to about half its orbital radius , and produces a prominent pair of arms with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath3 in face - on images ( figure  [ fig : basic ] ) .",
    "our results for face - on systems confirm previous findings in @xcite and @xcite based on _",
    "athena_++ ( stone et al .",
    ", in preparation ) hydro models , and can be compared with ( and provide predictions for ) current and future nir imaging observations using gemini / gpi , vlt / naco / sphere , and subaru / hiciao / scexao .",
    "below , we summarize the arm and gap morphologies presented in this paper :    1 .",
    "companion - induced spiral structures quickly settle into a quasi - steady state after @xmath11610 orbits ( figure  [ fig : image_100mj_orbits ] ) . for face - on views ,",
    "the morphologies are insensitive to observing wavelength and to the total ism dust mass assumed , suggesting the positions of the arms are largely independent of altitude .",
    "total intensity and polarized intensity images of face - on disks exhibit the same morphologies ( figures  [ fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] and [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] ) .",
    "2 .   depending on the viewing inclination and position angle , the trailing - double - arm pattern for face - on views may appear as one trailing arm ; two trailing arms to one side of the star ; or two arms on the same side but winding in opposite directions ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] ) .",
    "3 .   at inclinations",
    "@xmath152 , the bottom ( obscured ) half of the disk emerges . in the @xmath0 model",
    "the nearside of the bottom half of the outer disk ring can be seen , and is always symmetric about the minor axis independent of the viewing angle ( figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] ) . in the @xmath1 model ,",
    "the two spirals on the bottom half are directly visible as they are not blocked by an outer disk ; the bottom half in this case is asymmetric to varying degrees depending on the position angle ( figures  [ fig : image_100mj_geometry ] and [ fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] ) .",
    "we confirmed the findings of @xcite that @xmath104 ( equation  [ eq : qr ] ) and pi are generally similar . by comparison",
    ", @xmath105 ( equation  [ eq : ur ] ) represents observational noise in relatively face - on systems , but does contain signal for systems with @xmath153 ( figure  [ fig : image_100mj_pianalysis ] ) .",
    "we also highlight the shortcomings of two standard image reconstruction procedures :    1 .   the conventional practice of deprojecting inclined disk images based on the known inclination can not restore the face - on morphology ( figures  [ fig : image_3mj_deproj ] and [ fig : image_100mj_deproj ] ) , particularly for high inclinations .",
    "the procedure ( 1 ) can not recover the total number of arms ; ( 2 ) can not recover the arm locations ; ( 3 ) can not restore gaps and outer disk rings back to concentric circular structures ; and ( 4 ) can not remove the dark lane of the disk midplane .",
    "the dynamical planet - mass measurement technique based on arm morphology @xcite applies only to disks with inclinations @xmath154 .",
    "2 .   the rescaling of images by @xmath134 introduces artificial azimuthal variations , for the obvious reason that in such systems",
    ", the physical distance to the star can differ from the projected distance .    finally , we make the following connections between our models and observations :    1 .",
    "asymmetric structures in nearly edge - on disks may be caused by spiral arms .",
    "big and wide arms excited by massive ( e.g. , stellar mass ) companions can generate global scale asymmetries , similar to those seen in hst observations of the hh  30 disk which is inclined by @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "narrower arms excited by planet - mass companions viewed from certain angles can collapse along the line of sight to appear as clumps in nearly edge - on disks ( figure  [ fig : image_3mj_edgeon ] ) .",
    "2 .   the partial gap at @xmath145  au in ab aur observed by subaru / hiciao @xcite may be a gap opened by a @xmath0 planet at 67 au . in this interpretation ,",
    "the disk viewed at @xmath120 inclination and @xmath155 position angle rotates counterclockwise on the sky , and has a nearside to the southeast , consistent with observations ( figure  [ fig : image_abaur ] ) .",
    "the single arm observed at @xmath116130  au in the hd  141569  a disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hst ) may be a trailing - double - arm structure viewed at @xmath116@xmath144 inclination .",
    "4 .   at @xmath152 , the disk ring outside the gap opened by a giant planet manifests itself as two pseudo - arms placed symmetrically about the minor axis winding in opposite directions ( figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] ) .",
    "our model image of a disk perturbed by a @xmath0 planet at 25 au , when viewed at @xmath148 inclination , resembles the ak sco system as observed by sphere ( @xcite ; figure  [ fig : image_aksco ] ) .",
    "a similar interpretation may explain the pair of minor - axis - symmetric arms at @xmath151  au in the inner disk of hd 100546 , as viewed at @xmath116@xmath144 inclination ( @xcite , gpi ; @xcite , sphere ) .",
    "our models make a prediction that can be tested by observations in the near future : these arms should have a much higher polarization fraction than the rest of the disk ( see the two pf `` wings '' indicated by the arrows in figure  [ fig : image_3mj_geometry_gap ] ) . a deeper exposure may also reveal the dark lane of the disk midplane parallel to these pseudo - arms .",
