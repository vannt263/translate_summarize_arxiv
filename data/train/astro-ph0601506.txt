    "bl lac objects ( hereinafter bl lacs or bll ) are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterized by luminous , rapidly variable uv  to  nir non  thermal continuum emission and polarization , strong compact flat spectrum radio emission and superluminal motion .",
    "similar properties are observed also in flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and the two types of active nuclei are often grouped together in the blazar class . from the spectroscopical point of view",
    "bl lacs are characterized by quasi featureless optical spectra .",
    "in fact their spectra are often dominated by the non  thermal continuum that arises from the nucleus . to this emission",
    "it is superimposed a thermal contribution due to the stellar component of the host galaxy .",
    "like in other agn , emission lines could be generated by fluorescence in clouds surrounding the central black hole .",
    "moreover , as it happens for high z quasars in some cases absorption lines due to intervening gas in the halo of foreground galaxies can be observed in the spectra of bl lacs and one can derive a lower limit to the redshift of the object .",
    "the detectability of spectral features depends on the brightness of the nuclear source : in fact during low brightness states , intrinsic absorption features can be more easily revealed , while during high states one can better discover intervening absorption systems . because of the strong contribution from the continuum the equivalent width ( ew ) of all these spectral features is often very small and their detection represents a challenging task .    in the past decade a number of projects were carried out to derive the redshift of bl lac objects .",
    "most of these works were based on optical spectra collected with 4 m class telescopes , and are therefore limited by relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , low spectral resolution and limited wavelength range ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "recently , however , some observations with 8 m class telescopes were carried out @xcite . despite these efforts , a significant fraction of known bl lacs ( e. g. 50 % in @xcite catalogue ) have still unknown redshift .    in order to improve the knowledge of the redshift of bl lacs we carried out a project to obtain optical spectra of sources with still unknown or uncertain redshift using the european southern observatory ( eso ) 8-m very large telescopes ( vlt ) .",
    "this allows one to improve significantly the s / n of the spectra and therefore the capability to detect faint spectral features .",
    "a first report on this work , giving the redshift of 12 objects , has been presented by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "paper i ) , and here we refer on the results for the full sample of 42 observed sources .",

    "the sample of bl lac objects ( and candidates ) observed with the vlt telescopes was selected from two extended lists of bl lacs : the @xcite collection of bl lacs and the sedentary survey ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * in the following addressed as ss ) .",
    "the @xcite list contains all objects identified as bl lacs belonging to the complete samples existing at the time of its compilation , selected in the radio , optical and x - ray bands ( e.g. : 1 jansky survey  1-jy , @xcite , palomar - green survey ",

    "the criteria used to define a bl lac object in @xcite depend on the sample of origin . in most cases ,",
    "the ew of the lines is required to be @xmath55  , but also uv excess , optical polarization and variability , radio - to - optical spectral index are used as selecting criteria .",
    "the ss was obtained cross - correlating the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) sky survey ( nvss ) data @xcite with the rosat all sky survey  bright source catalogue ( rbsc ) list of sources @xcite .",
    "ss selected a complete sample of 150 high energy peaked bl lacs ( hbl , see * ? ? ? * for definition ) down to a 3.5 mjy radio flux limit .",
    "bl lac classification in the ss is based on the position of the sources on the @xmath6 plane .",
    "the @xcite and ss datasets lead to a combined list containing 348 objects .",
    "the distribution of the v magnitude for these objects is reported in fig .",

    "we obtained three spectra in order to get a good correction of cosmic rays and to check the reality of weak features .",
    "the individual frames were then combined into a single average image .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the spectra of a helium / neon / argon lamp obtained during the same observing night , reaching an accuracy of @xmath0 3 (rms ) . from these images we extracted one - dimensional spectra adopting an optimal extraction algorithm @xcite to improve the s / n .",
    "although this program did not require optimal photometric conditions , most of the observations were obtained with clear sky .",
    "this enables us to perform a spectrophotometric calibration of the acquired data using standard stars @xcite observed in the same nights . from the database of sky conditions at paranal we estimate that a photometric accuracy of 10% was reached during our observing nights .",
    "the spectra were also corrected for galactic extinction , using the law by @xcite and assuming values of e@xmath11 from @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ fig : spec ] we give the optical spectrum of each source . in order to show more clearly the continuum shape and the faint features we report both the flux calibrated and the normalized spectrum for each object . the main emission and absorption features",
    "are identified .",
    "those due to the galactic interstellar gas are indicated as `` ism '' and `` dib '' ( diffuse interstellar bands , see section [ sec : resb ] ) , while telluric absorptions are marked as @xmath12 .      in a first approximation , the optical continuum of a bl lac object",
    "is due to the superposition of two components : the non - thermal emission of the active nucleus , doppler - enhanced because of the alignment of the jet with the line of sight , and the emission of the host galaxy .",
    "depending on the relative strength of the nucleus with respect to the galaxy light , the spectral signature of the latter can be either easily detected or diluted beyond the point of recognition .",
    "taking into account the robust evidence that the host galaxies are giant ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to describe the continuum and derive the optical spectral index of the non - thermal component , we fitted a power law ( @xmath13 , the spectral indices are given in table [ tab : results ] ) plus the spectrum of a typical elliptical galaxy as described by the @xcite template . while in most cases the contribution of the host galaxy was negligible , in 6 sources it was not , and the luminosity of the host can thus be derived .",
    "for these six sources ( three of them were presented in paper i ) we give the best fit decomposition in fig.[fig : gfit2 ] and report the parameters in table [ tab : gfit ] .",
    "the derived absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies are consistent with the distribution of m@xmath14 of bl lac hosts given by @xcite .",
    "the detection and the measurement of very weak spectral features is difficult to assess because it depends on the choice of the parameters used to define the spectral line and the continuum . in order to apply an objective method for",
    "any given spectrum we evaluate the minimum measurable equivalent width ( ew@xmath15 ) defined as twice the rms of the distribution of all ew values measured dividing the normalized spectrum into 30   wide bins ( details for this automatic routine are given in paper i ) .",
    "we checked that the s / n ratio dependence inside the considered spectral range varies at most by 20 % , remaining @xmath910% over a large wavelength range .",
    "this reflects into a similar variation of ew@xmath15 .",
    "the procedure for calculating ew@xmath15  was applied to all featureless or quasi - featureless spectra to find faint spectral lines .",
    "all features above the ew@xmath15  threshold , ranging from @xmath0 1   to 0.1   in our data , were considered as line candidates and were carefully visually inspected and measured .",
    "the results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] . based on the detected lines and the shape of the continuum we confirm the bl lac classification for 36 objects , while 6 sources were reclassified .",
    "depending on the observed spectral properties the objects can be assembled in three groups .",

    "three have redshift derived from emission lines ( 0723008 , z=0.128 ; 2131021 , z=1.284 ; 2223114 , z=0.997 ) and three from absorption lines ( 1212 + 078 , z=0.137 ; 1248296 , z=0.382 ; 2214313 , z=0.460 ) .",

    "we assume that the observed spectrum of a bl lac object is given by the contribution of two components : 1- a non - thermal emission from the nucleus that can be described by a power law ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the normalization constant ) ; 2 - a thermal component due to the host galaxy .",
    "depending on the relative contribution of the two components the optical spectrum will be dominated by the non - thermal ( featureless ) emission or by the spectral signature of the host galaxy . the observed equivalent width ( ew@xmath22 ) of a given spectral absorption line",

    "detection of this spectral feature requires a spectrum with a sufficiently high s / n .",

    "the main parameters involved are the shape and the size of the host galaxy . according to the most extensive imaging studies of bll @xcite we assumed that the host galaxy is a giant elliptical of effective radius r@xmath29= 10 kpc .",
