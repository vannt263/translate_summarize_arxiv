    "dwarf galaxies provide unique probes of the star  formation process in low metallicity environments . despite a significant amount of observational and theoretical work on these systems",
    ", we still have many unanswered questions about star formation in low mass , low metallicity objects .",
    "for instance , azimuthal averages of the hi column density indicate that the gas density in dwarf irregulars is significantly lower ( by factors of 23 ) than the toomre ( 1964 ) instability criterion throughout the star forming disk ( e.g. , hunter & plummer 1996 ; van zee 1997b ; hunter 1998a ) . in contrast",
    ", preliminary work on blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies suggests that they exceed the toomre instability criterion in the central regions , perhaps facilitating their high star  formation rates ( e.g. , taylor 1994 ) .",
    "while the above studies do not include the molecular gas component , primarily because it is difficult to detect in low metallicity systems ( e.g. , elmegreen 1980 ; israel 1995 ) , the neutral gas density appears to have a regulatory role on the star  formation process in dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , to further investigate these regulatory processes , we have undertaken high spatial resolution observations of a small sample of bcds , systems which are currently undergoing vigorous star  formation activity .    the class of objects known as bcds , or galaxies , form a heterogeneous sample ranging from true dwarf galaxies of only 10@xmath0 to outlying regions of moderate sized galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we will use the term bcd to refer to galaxies which meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) the underlying galaxy which is hosting the strong starburst has an absolute blue magnitude fainter than 16 ; ( 2 ) the optical size is at most a few kpc ; and ( 3 ) a large fraction of the optical light comes from a star burst .",
    "the origin and duration of the starburst phase in bcds is still unknown .",
    "one possibility is that the starburst is triggered , either by an interaction ( as discussed by taylor 1993 ) , or through a stochastic process .",
    "if the starburst phase in these galaxies is episodic , there should also exist in the local universe faded , or post  burst , bcds .",
    "several popular evolutionary scenarios suggest that the 3 common types of dwarf galaxies ( dwarf elliptical ( de ) , dwarf irregular ( di ) , and bcd ) are simply 3 different evolutionary stages for low mass objects ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; silk 1987 ; davies & phillipps 1988 ) .",
    "studies of the stellar content and distributions in dwarf galaxies have thus far been inconclusive in regard to the feasibility of such morphological transformations ( e.g. , loose & thuan 1986 ; drinkwater & hardy 1991 ; james 1994 ; papaderos 1996 ; sung 1998 ) . to date , few _",
    "constraints have been placed on such evolutionary scenarios , in part due to the dearth of good quality , high spatial and spectral resolution observations of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this paper presents the hi distribution and kinematics of five intrinsically compact galaxies in order to address both the regulatory role of gas density on star formation activity and the evolution of starbursting dwarf galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the data acquisition and reduction are presented in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "the hi distributions and kinematics are discussed in sections [ sec : hi ] and [ sec : kin ] , respectively .",
    "the individual galaxies are described in section [ sec : gals ] .",
    "a discussion of the neutral gas density distribution and star  formation threshold is presented in section [ sec : thresh ] . in section",
    "[ sec : dwfs ] , we discuss the implications on the evolutionary history of bcds , as derived from the neutral gas distributions and kinematics .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "multiconfiguration hi observations of five bcds were obtained with the very large array .",
    "complementary optical imaging observations were obtained at several different telescopes . in this section ,",
    "the procedures for observation and data reduction are discussed .      to date , few high spatial resolution ( 5  beams ) hi synthesis observations of dwarf galaxies have been published ( ii zw 40 , brinks & klein 1988 ; holmberg ii , puche 1992 ; ii  zw  33 , walter 1997 ; i  zw  18 , van zee 1998 ) . we elected , therefore , to restrict the sample of galaxies to systems which had previously been observed and detected with the vla in one of its more compact configurations ( c or d ) .",
    "these constraints led to the selection of 3 galaxies from the taylor ( 1995 ) sample ( um 439 , um 461 , and um 462 ) , ii  zw  40 ( brinks & klein 1988 ) , and ugc 4483 ( lo 1993 ) for our first attempt at high spatial resolution observations of bcd  like objects . all of the galaxies in the current sample meet the above criteria for bcds ; while ugc 4483 is not usually considered a bcd , perhaps due to its proximity , it too is vigorously forming stars at the present epoch .    the physical properties of the selected galaxies are summarized in table [ tab : global ] .",
    "the morphological classification and multiplicity for all systems other than ugc 4483 were taken from telles ( 1997 ) .",
    "the classification scheme is based on the lower surface brightness isophotes , where type i indicates irregularly shaped isophotes and type ii indicates symmetric isophotes . of the galaxies in the current sample , only ii zw 40 is classified as a type i bcd .",
    "the multiplicity indicates of the number of knots of star formation ; all of the galaxies in this sample have at least 2 prominent hii regions .",
    "also listed in table [ tab : global ] are the assumed distance to each system ( based on h@xmath1 of 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , except for ugc 4483 where the distance is assumed to be the same as ngc 2366 ( tolstoy 1995 ) ) , their absolute blue magnitudes ( stavely  smith 1992 ; telles 1997 ) , and oxygen abundances ( melnick 1988 ; skillman 1994 ) .",
    "the absolute blue magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction , but not for internal extinction or for nebular contributions to the broadband luminosity .",
    "ugc 4483 is the nearest system in the sample , and also has the lowest luminosity and metallicity .",
    "the other four galaxies are at comparable distances ( 1015 mpc ) and have moderate luminosities ( m@xmath3 s of 14 to 16 ) and metallicities ( 1/15 to 1/6 of solar ) .",
    "also tabulated are the optical diameters at the 25th mag arcsec@xmath4 isophote , in both arcsec and kpc ( de vaucouleurs 1991 ; salzer 1998a ) ; these systems are intrinsically small , with typical optical sizes of 12 kpc .      observations of ii zw 40 , ugc 4483 , um 439 , and um 461/2 were obtained with the vla in its b , c , and cs configurations during 1997 .",
    "the cs configuration is a modified version of the c configuration where 2 telescopes from the middle of the east / west arms are re  positioned at inner d configuration stations to provide short spacings .",
    "a summary of the observing sessions and the total on  source integration times are listed in table [ tab : vlaobs ] . during all",
    "observing sessions , the correlator was used in 2ad mode with the right and left circular polarizations tuned to the same frequency ; the total bandwidth was 1.56 mhz .",
    "the on  line hanning smoothing option was selected , producing final spectral data cubes of 127 channels , each 2.6  wide .",
    "standard tasks in aips ( napier 1983 ) were employed for calibration and preliminary data reduction .",
    "each set of observations was calibrated separately , using 3c 48 , 3c 147 , and 3c 286 as flux and bandpass calibrators , and nearby continuum sources as phase calibrators .",
    "the continuum emission was removed with the aips task uvlin prior to combination of uv data sets . only ii  zw  40 had substantial continuum emission associated with the system ; we refer the reader to other studies for discussion of the magnitude and extent of this continuum source ( e.g. , deeg 1993 ; deeg 1997 ) since the current observations were not optimized for continuum detection .",
    "the line data were transformed to the image plane with several weighting schemes and combinations of configurations . to check the data quality ,",
    "maps were made for each observing session .",
    "the data cubes presented in this paper were made from the combined data sets of the b , c , and cs configuration observations .",
    "a robust weighting technique was employed by the aips task imagr to optimize the beam shape and noise levels ( briggs 1995 ) .",
    "the `` robustness parameter '' in imagr controls the weighting of the uv data , permitting a fine  tuning between sensitivity and resolution in the final data cubes .",
    "as currently implemented , a robustness of 5 corresponds to natural weighting of the uv data ( maximizing sensitivity at the cost of spatial resolution ) while a robustness of 5 corresponds to uniform weighting ( maximal spatial resolution with lower sensitivity ) .",
    "additionally , some maps were made with uv tapers to increase their sensitivity to low column density material .",
    "the relevant imagr parameters for a selected sample of the maps are listed in table [ tab : maps ] . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to the lowest resolution , tapered data cubes as the `` tapered cubes '' , to the robustness of 5 cubes as the `` natural weight cubes '' , and to the robustness of 0.5 cubes as the `` intermediate weight cubes . ''",
    "selected channels from the hi data cubes are presented in figures [ fig : chans40][fig : chans462 ] . all subsequent analysis was performed within the gipsy package ( van der hulst 1992 ) .    to determine if the total flux density was recovered in the hi synthesis observations , total integrated profiles were constructed from the natural weight data cubes after correcting for the primary beam shape with the gipsy task pbcorr .",
    "for all systems , the total flux density recovered in the vla maps is in good agreement ( within 5% ) with previous single dish flux measurements ( e.g. , stavely ",
    "smith 1992 ; van zee 1995 ; van zee 1997c ; salzer 1998b ; j. salzer 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "the total hi masses listed in table [ tab : global ] were calculated from the observed vla flux density and the assumed distance to the system .",
    "moment maps of each data cube were computed in the following manner . for each galaxy ,",
    "the natural weight cube was smoothed to a resolution of twice the beam ; the smoothed cubes were clipped at the 2 sigma level ( the noise level was measured in several line  free regions of the smoothed cube ) ; the resultant clipped cube was then interactively blanked to remove spurious noise spikes .",
    "signal was identified based on spatial continuity between channels .",
    "a conditional transfer was used to blank the corresponding locations in both the natural and intermediate weight data cubes ( corrected for primary beam attenuation ) based on the blanked , smoothed cube .",
    "moment maps of the smoothed , natural , and intermediate weight data cubes were created with the gipsy task moments and are presented in figures [ fig : iizw40][fig : um462 ] .      optical broad band and h@xmath5 images were obtained during several observing runs .",
    "the observing parameters are summarized in table [ tab : optobs ] .",
    "the observation and reduction procedures for the h@xmath5 image of ugc 4483 are described in skillman ( 1994 ) .",
    "h@xmath5 and b  band images of um 439 , um 461 , um 462 , and ii zw 40 were obtained with the kpno no .",
    "1 0.9 m telescope and followed similar reduction procedures as those described in salzer ( 1991 ) .",
    "finally , r  band images of ii zw 40 and ugc 4483 were obtained with the kpno 0.9 m telescope ; the observation and reduction procedures for these images were identical to those described in van zee ( 1997a ) .",
    "plate solutions for the optical images were derived from coordinates of at least five stars listed in the apm catalog ( maddox 1990 ) and are accurate to 0.5 .",
    "h@xmath5 luminosities were computed from the observed h@xmath5 flux and the assumed distance to each system .",
    "the h@xmath5 luminosity was then converted to the current star",
    " formation rate ( sfr ) , assuming a salpeter imf ( hunter & gallagher 1986 ) : @xmath6 the current sfr and the gas depletion time scale ( m@xmath7/sfr ) are tabulated in table [ tab : global ] .",
    "note that if the imf is biased towards high mass stars , the calculated gas depletion time scale will be an underestimate .",
    "the derived gas depletion time scales should be indicative , however , since observations of the stellar populations in starbursting ( e.g. , r136 , massey & hunter 1998 ) and low metallicity environments ( e.g. , smc and lmc , massey 1995 ) , are consistent with a salpeter imf . in general , the current sfrs of the bcds are quite high , with typical gas depletion times of approximately 1 gyr .",
    "a significant fraction of the gas associated with dwarf galaxies frequently extends well beyond the optical system ( e.g. , ddo 154 , carignan & beaulieu 1989 ; ngc 4449 , bajaja 1994 ; hunter 1998b ) .",
    "the hi diameters of the bcds ( defined as the maximum diameter measured at a column density of 10@xmath8 atoms cm@xmath4 ) were obtained from the hi column density maps made from the low resolution tapered data cubes [ figures [ fig : iizw40](a)[fig : um462](a ) ] . the hi  to  optical diameter ratios",
    "are listed in table [ tab : global ] .",
    "the hi distributions of all five systems are extended , with sizes typically 34 times that of the optical diameter . ii zw 40 is the most extreme , with tidal tails extending approximately 8.5  in diameter ( see section [ sec : iizw40 ] ) ; the hi diameter listed in table [ tab : global ] for this galaxy was obtained by measuring only the inner hi distribution , along a position angle of 115 .",
    "these results are consistent with other spatially resolved observations of bcd  type galaxies , which have also found large hi  to  optical diameter ratios ( e.g. , taylor 1994 ; van zee 1998 ) .",
    "the wealth of detail visible in the high spatial resolution maps is striking .",
    "figures [ fig : iizw40](b)[fig : um462](b ) illustrate the clumpiness of the ism on 10  spatial scales ; even more detail is seen at the highest spatial resolution of these observations [ figures [ fig : iizw40](c)[fig : um462](c ) ] .",
    "for instance , the hi distribution for ugc 4483 ( linear scales of 100 to 300 pc ) is clearly clumpy on all spatial scales sampled .",
    "inspection of the outer hi distributions reveal varying degrees of irregularity in both the column density distribution and kinematic continuity .",
    "for example , in um 439 there appears to be an associated hi cloud to the east of the main galaxy .",
    "this cloud is likely to be a real feature since it was detected in both the c and cs configuration observations , as well as in previous d configuration observations ( taylor 1995 ) .",
    "another example of this phenomenon is the gas to the north of um 461 which appears to be kinematically distinct in the channel maps ( figure [ fig : chans461 ] ) but is not clearly spatially separated from the main galaxy .",
    "similar hi clouds have been detected around other star forming galaxies ( e.g. , taylor 1995 ; wilcots 1996 ) .",
    "however , not all low mass galaxies have such features ( e.g. , van zee 1997b ) .",
    "the source and ultimate fate of the gas in the periphery of these galaxies is unclear .",
    "several possible origins are : ( 1 ) warping of the outer gas disk ; ( 2 ) ejecta from previous episodes of star formation ; ( 3 ) material still in the process of accretion ; or ( 4 ) tidal debris .",
    "the present observations of the gas kinematics and distribution can not constrain the origin of this outlying material .",
    "azimuthal averages of the hi surface density of the bcds are shown in figure [ fig : radprofs ] .",
    "in addition , comparison samples of dis ( van zee 1997b ) and a few additional bcds ( taylor 1994 ) have been taken from the literature .",
    "as previously remarked by taylor ( 1994 ; 1995 ) , bcds tend to have centrally peaked surface densities .",
    "in contrast , dis tend to have flat hi distributions in the inner regions , more similar to the hi distributions of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , cayatte 1994 ) .",
    "not only are the bcds centrally concentrated , their central surface densities are significantly higher than those of the dis .",
    "analysis of their underlying stellar light distributions ( i.e. , with the starburst removed ) also indicates that bcd host galaxies have more centrally concentrated stellar mass densities than dis ( e.g. , norton & salzer 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the bcds appear to have inherently different stellar and gas mass distributions than dis . this may be a clue to the origin of strong star ",
    "formation activity in bcds .",
    "in this section we present the results of kinematic studies based on the hi velocity information .",
    "the observed velocity gradients are used to estimate dynamical masses in section [ sec : vel ] . in section [ sec : disp ] , we demonstrate that these systems are dominated by rotation .",
    "the velocity fields ( moment 1 ) were calculated from the blanked natural weight data cubes and are presented in figures [ fig : iizw40](d)[fig : um462](d ) .",
    "the velocity fields are complex .",
    "ii  zw  40 has extensive tidal tails , with velocity continuity from the main body to the ends of the tails . in this system",
    ", the southeastern tail has a reversal in the velocity field , suggesting that the most extended material is starting to fall back onto the main galaxy ( cf .",
    "hibbard & mihos 1995 ) ( see section [ sec : iizw40 ] for further discussion of this system ) . while none of the other galaxies have apparent tidal features , other kinematic irregularities such as warps ( e.g. , ugc 4483 ) and kinematically distinct clumps of hi gas ( e.g. , um 439 ) are present in all the systems .",
    "nonetheless , despite their complexity , all have velocity gradients across the galaxy .",
    "inspection of the channel maps ( figures [ fig : chans40][fig : chans462 ] ) indicates a clear axis of rotation for each of the galaxies .",
    "the complexity present in the velocity fields inhibits dynamical investigations using standard tilted  ring models .",
    "nonetheless , we have obtained rough estimates of the dynamical masses for 3 of the 5 systems based on the observed velocity gradients and estimates of the inclination angle . in standard",
    "tilted  ring analyses , the center coordinates , systemic velocity , position angle , inclination angle , and rotation velocity are fit independently for each ring . in our analysis",
    ", we required that all parameters , except the rotation velocity , be constant for all rings .",
    "further , the inclination angles were fixed based on the observed hi isophotal axial ratios rather than on kinematic constraints .",
    "the inclination estimates assumed a thin gas disk ; if the gas disk is thick , as may be the case for low mass galaxies ( e.g. , puche 1992 ) , the inclination will be larger than estimated here .",
    "the derived parameters are tabulated in table [ tab : hiparms ] . tilted",
    " ring models were not attempted for ii  zw  40 or um 461 ; their tabulated parameters are rough estimates at best .    position ",
    "velocity diagrams with the derived rotation curves superposed are shown in figure [ fig : pv ] .",
    "the natural weight data cubes were sliced along the nominal position angles , centered at the kinematic center . as frequently found in low mass systems , the position ",
    "velocity diagrams are consistent with solid body rotation throughout the galaxy .",
    "the outermost points of the rotation curves ( r@xmath10 and v@xmath11 ) are tabulated in table [ tab : hiparms ] .",
    "dynamical masses , based on the outermost points of the rotation curves , are also tabulated in table [ tab : hiparms ] ; we emphasize that these masses were derived from only rough dynamical estimates .",
    "the ratio of m@xmath7/m@xmath12 , typically found to be approximately 0.1 for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , skillman 1987 ; van zee 1997b ) , is approximately 0.3 for these bcds ( table [ tab : hiparms ] ) .",
    "whether these high values of m@xmath7/m@xmath12 are significant is unclear ; the kinematic models were relatively unconstrained , so it is possible that the dynamical mass has been underestimated in these calculations .",
    "interestingly , salzer ( 1998b ) also find higher than typical m@xmath7/m@xmath12 for bcds , based on single dish hi spectra . on the other hand , other spatially resolved observations of bcds ( e.g. , taylor 1994 ) have resulted in values of m@xmath7/m@xmath12 more typical of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "further high spatial and spectral resolution observations of bcds will be needed to determine if a large fraction of their total mass is usually in the form of neutral hydrogen .",
    "gaussian fits to spectral profiles from the natural weight data cubes were used to determine the average velocity dispersion for each galaxy .",
    "the median @xmath13 is tabulated in table [ tab : hiparms ] .",
    "the observed velocity dispersions are slightly higher than typically found in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , young & lo 1996 ; van zee 1997b ) , but this may be due to the moderate velocity gradients and compact nature of these galaxies resulting in an additional broadening component due to rotation within the beam . unfortunately , due to their lower signal  to  noise , velocity dispersions could not be measured accurately from the higher spatial resolution maps .",
    "nonetheless , the observed velocity dispersions are significantly less than the rotational component in these galaxies .",
    "thus , these systems are _ rotation dominated_.",
    "in this section we present qualitative descriptions of the individual galaxies .",
    "the new observations are also compared with previous data from the literature .",
    "ii zw 40 ( ugca 116 ) is one of the prototypical bcds ( e.g. , sargent & searle 1970 ; searle & sargent 1972 ) .",
    "it is the only galaxy in the present sample classified as a type i bcd ( telles 1997 ) , and is also the only galaxy in this sample that is clearly the result of a merger .",
    "the possibility that the burst of star formation in ii  zw  40 was the result of an interaction was first raised by baldwin ( 1982 ) , based on the optical morphology .",
    "hi imaging observations confirmed the merger scenario for this galaxy and led to speculation that tidal interactions might be necessary to trigger the high star ",
    "formation rates in bcds ( brinks & klein 1988 ) .",
    "the combination of several pieces of evidence suggests that ii  zw  40 is likely to be a merger , not merely the result of tidal interactions : ( 1 ) the optical morphology is consistent with that of two overlapping / merging dwarf galaxies , ( 2 ) there is no evidence for a second optical galaxy anywhere along the hi tidal tails , and ( 3 ) a strong color gradient indicates that the low surface brightness optical extensions are from an older stellar population . in particular",
    ", the lsb extension to the south of the intense star burst is quite red , indicating that these stars are from a much older population than the current starburst .",
    "the colors ( corrected for galactic reddening and nebular emission ) range from b ",
    "h @xmath14 1.0 at the starburst to b ",
    "h @xmath14 3.1 in the lsb southern arm ( salzer 1998a ) .",
    "the extension to the se is intermediate in color , and also exhibits a modest level of h@xmath5 emission , indicating that star formation may be occurring there as well .",
    "the morphology of the system , as well as the extreme color gradients , are consistent with the picture that ii  zw  40 is an ongoing merger of two gas  rich dwarf galaxies .    the new high sensitivity hi maps presented here indicate that the tidal tails are even more extensive than illustrated in brinks & klein ( 1988 ) .",
    "in many regards , the hi distribution and velocity field in ii zw 40 is reminiscent of ngc 7252 , a member of arp s ( 1966 ) atlas which has been designated as a prototypical merging pair of galaxies by toomre ( 1977 ) .",
    "the hi tidal tails are drawn out from the optical galaxies , and a reversal in the velocity gradient is detected in the southeastern tail . while the masses of the components of the ngc 7252 merger are an order of magnitude higher than those of ii zw 40 ( cf .",
    "hibbard 1994 ) , it is interesting to compare these two systems .",
    "hibbard & mihos ( 1995 ) conducted n - body simulations of ngc 7252 and determined that the velocity reversals seen in the tidal tails of that system were due to material falling back towards the dynamical center . in both ngc 7252 and ii zw 40 , the radial velocities at the ends of the tidal tails are similar to the radial velocities of the main bodies .",
    "the simulations of hibbard & mihos ( 1995 ) give a detailed timetable for the return of tidal material to the system .",
    "the return is spread out over several gyr , but more than half of the gas has returned in the first gyr . without a similar detailed model of ii zw 40 , quantitative estimates of the fallback of material to the system is not possible ( and we would encourage others to carry - out such modelling ) . with such modelling , it will be possible to determine if infall could sustain star formation at an elevated rate and increase the lifetime of the burst or result in a second episode of increased star formation .",
    "since @xmath1440% of the gas is in the tidal tails , the return of this gas to the main body could have a significant effect on the future star formation of the system .",
    "a modelling investigation of the low mass merger ii zw 40 could provide valuable insight into the future evolution of this system .",
    "ugc 4483 , normally considered an i m galaxy , was included in the bcd sample because of its compact nature and moderate star  formation rate .",
    "if this system were placed at a distance of 10 mpc ( the typical distance of the other galaxies in this sample ) , it might be classified as a bcd . as mentioned previously",
    ", the bcd class is quite heterogeneous ; ugc",
    "4483 would qualify as a weak bcd in that its star forming regions contribute a large fraction of its total luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "its gas depletion time scale is fairly long , almost 10 gyr , similar to that found for more quiescent dwarf irregulars ( e.g. , van zee 1997a ) .    in this system ,",
    "several knots of star formation are superimposed on a low surface brightness stellar component .",
    "the brightest knot of active star formation is located to the north of the optical center and is associated with the peak neutral gas column density . as previously noted by lo ( 1993 ) , the hi distribution extends well beyond the optical system .",
    "this galaxy is the nearest object in the sample and thus the hi observations have the highest linear resolution , on the order of 100 pc beam@xmath2 . on these small spatial scales ,",
    "the hi distribution is distinctly clumpy and irregular [ figure [ fig : u4483](b ) ] .",
    "interestingly , despite the high linear resolution of these observations , there are no obvious hi holes , such as those seen in ic  10 ( shostak & skillman markcitess891989 ) , holmberg ii ( puche 1992 ) , and vv 794 ( taylor 1994 ) .",
    "nonetheless , at this resolution a strong correlation is seen between column density peaks and sites of active star formation .",
    "furthermore , this system allows an estimate of the effect of beam smearing on the observed peak column densities .",
    "as expected , low resolution observations have correspondingly lower peak column densities ( table [ tab : colden ] ) .",
    "for instance , an increase in the spatial resolution by a factor of 5 corresponds to an increase in the observed column density by a factor of 2 .",
    "the most intense region of star formation is located south of the center of the optical portion of um 439 ( ugc 6578 ) , and the highest column density of hi gas occurs at this location as well .",
    "there is weaker , more diffuse , h@xmath5 emission over most of the central part of the galaxy , suggesting that there has been vigorous star formation occurring there in the recent past .",
    "this activity is apparently dying out .",
    "the location of the strong knot on the outskirts of the optical galaxy implies an outward propagation of star formation . despite the appearance of recent strong activity in the central portion of the galaxy",
    ", there is no evidence for an hi hole in the middle of this object as is seen in other dwarf galaxies ( puche & westpfahl 1994 ) . at the distance of um 439 , however , the detection of such holes would be difficult .",
    "the neutral gas is centrally peaked , and extends well beyond the star forming regions .",
    "previous hi mapping of this galaxy indicated the presence of extended gas to the east ( van zee 1995 ; taylor 1995 ) .",
    "the new observations confirm the extended structure to the east , but the total mass of this object is only @xmath146 @xmath15 10@xmath16 , approximately 2% of the total hi in this system .",
    "given its low mass and low column density , it is unlikely to be a companion to um 439 .",
    "the present observations are not able to determine the origin of this gas cloud , but it would be of great interest to determine if this extended material has been significantly enriched by previous star formation episodes .",
    "two bright knots of active star formation dominate um 461 .",
    "the hi distribution extends well beyond the optical system . like um 439",
    ", the extended gas on the east side of um 461 is kinematically complex .",
    "the extended structure visible to the se in the taylor ( 1995 ) maps is not recovered here ; this feature was probably introduced by solar interference in their d configuration maps ( taylor 1996 ) .",
    "the velocity field [ figure [ fig : um461](d ) ] indicates that there is a velocity gradient across this system , but the field is too complex to permit rotation curve fits .",
    "um 462 ( ugc 6850 ; mk 1307 ) is dominated by two knots of star formation , the brighter of which is centrally located in the galaxy .",
    "the hi distribution extends well beyond the optical system and peaks near the central star forming regions .",
    "the velocity field is indicative of solid body rotation .",
    "in contrast to the image presented in taylor ( 1995 ) , um 461 and um 462 do not appear to be tidally interacting ( figure [ fig : um461/2 ] ) .",
    "assuming that the systems are both at a distance of 13.9 mpc , the linear separation between the two systems is approximately 70 kpc ( 40 times the average of their optical diameters , and 11 times their mean hi diameters ) .",
    "assuming a relative velocity of @xmath14100 , the crossing time is 7 @xmath15 10@xmath17 years , significantly longer than the age of the star bursts ( expected to be less than 100 myr ) .",
    "furthermore , both um 461 and um 462 are classified as type ii bcds by telles ( 1997 ) , indicating that they are symmetric objects in the optical .",
    "thus , even if these systems are physically associated , it is unlikely that they induced the high rates of star formation in each other .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : hi ] , bcds tend to have higher central gas mass concentrations than dis , suggesting an intrinsic difference in the hi distribution between quiescent dis and bcds .",
    "previous studies of the neutral gas distribution in bcds and dis indicate that the gas column density can play a critical role in regulating star  formation activity ( e.g. , skillman 1987 ; taylor 1994 ; hunter & plummer 1996 ; van zee 1997b ; hunter 1998a ) . in studies such as these",
    ", the gas density should include both the atomic and molecular gas components . in practice , however , the molecular gas distribution is usually unknown due to the difficulty detecting co in low mass , low metallicity galaxies ( e.g. , elmegreen 1980 ) .",
    "furthermore , even when co is detected , the conversion factor from co to h@xmath18 column density is highly uncertain ( e.g. , verter & hodge 1995 ; wilson 1995 ) .",
    "thus , we note that the column densities quoted in the following discussion are lower limits since we have elected to apply no correction for the contribution of molecular gas .",
    "we do , however , include a correction for helium : n@xmath19 = 4/3 n@xmath7 .",
    "the observed peak neutral hydrogen gas column densities ( n@xmath7 ) and the corresponding neutral gas surface density ( corrected for inclination and helium content , @xmath20 ) are tabulated in table [ tab : colden ] .",
    "many of the gas density studies rely on azimuthal averages of the gas surface density and star  formation rate , such as those illustrated in figure [ fig : radprofs ] . in disk systems ,",
    "the toomre ( 1964 ) instability criterion provides a natural threshold density with which to compare azimuthally averaged radial density profiles .",
    "the toomre criterion represents the balance between gravitational collapse and rotational shear and thermal pressure ; we note that in the limit of zero rotational shear ( solid body rotation ) , this criterion is still valid .",
    "we have tabulated the value of the toomre instability criterion ( @xmath21 ) for ugc 4483 , um 439 , and um 462 in table [ tab : colden ] , assuming the kinematic parameters from section [ sec : kin ] and solid body rotation throughout the disk ( ii  zw  40 and um 461 have been excluded from this analysis since their kinematic parameters were unconstrained ) .",
    "in contrast to the results for dis , where the global gas density rarely , if ever , exceeds the toomre instability criterion ( e.g. , van zee 1997b ; hunter 1998a ) , the toomre value is exceeded in the central regions of all three bcds , suggesting that star ",
    "formation activity should be enhanced in the inner regions of these galaxies .    while radial profiles are potentially useful as global indicators of star ",
    "formation activity , azimuthal averages tend to dampen star formation signatures in systems where star formation is a local process , such as irregular and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , van zee 1997b ) .",
    "visual inspection of figures [ fig : iizw40](c)[fig : um462](c ) indicates a good correlation between sites of active star formation and local peaks in the hi column density .",
    "intensity profiles for both the hi and h@xmath5 emission are presented in figure [ fig : cuts ] ; each profile is centered on the peak h@xmath5 emission feature and is oriented such that additional hii regions are included in the profile .",
    "in addition to the five bcds in this sample , a panel for i  zw  18 is also included ( van zee 1998 ) . upon detailed inspection of these intensity profiles ,",
    "it is clear that the high rate of star ",
    "formation activity in the bcds has had an impact on the neutral gas surface density .",
    "in particular , while situated near the column density peak , the brightest hii regions in ii zw 40 and ugc 4483 are actually located in slight depressions .",
    "this is likely due to either strong stellar winds evacuating the gas or photoionization from the uv continuum of the ob stars . despite this evidence of local feedback from the star ",
    "formation activity on the neutral medium , the overall impression is that sites of active star formation are associated with regions of high column density ( 24 @xmath22 atoms cm@xmath4 ) .",
    "it has been hypothesized that the empirical critical star  formation threshold density ( 10@xmath23 atoms",
    "cm@xmath4 ) found in many types of galaxies could correspond to a critical column density of dust necessary to shield molecular gas from uv radiation ( federman 1979 ) .",
    "if so , this suggests that the empirical threshold might be a function of metallicity . the bcd sample which , with the addition of i  zw  18 ( van zee 1998 ) , spans a factor of 10 in metallicity , provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis . in figure",
    "[ fig : column](a ) the observed peak column densities are plotted as a function of metallicity for the bcd sample and for di galaxies from the literature ( skillman 1988 ; shostak & skillman 1989 ; lo 1993 ; van zee 1997b ) .",
    "the oxygen abundances for the di galaxies and i  zw  18 were also taken from the literature ( skillman 1989 ; skillman & kennicutt 1993 ; van zee 1996 ; van zee 1997a ) . while the peak column density may not be the most appropriate indicator ( a `` threshold '' density might be more useful , but",
    "is rarely reported in the literature ) , it is a useful diagnostic , particularly in bcds where one can assume that the hii regions have not significantly aged .",
    "the peak column densities have not been corrected for inclination or beam effects , so a large scatter in this plot is not unexpected .",
    "the total number of objects is still small , but there is no obvious trend for an increase in column density with decreasing metallicity ; rather , the most obvious trend in this plot is that dis clearly have lower column densities than the bcds at similar metallicities . by removing the restriction of previous knowledge of the oxygen abundance ,",
    "larger sample sizes for both the bcds and dis are possible . in figure",
    "[ fig : column](b ) , the distributions of peak column densities for bcds and dis are shown .",
    "the bcd sample includes data from the present sample , taylor ( 1994 ) , and van zee ( 1998 ) ; the di sample includes those galaxies in the above literature compilation as well as skillman ( 1987 ) , ct ( 1995 ) , kobulnicky & skillman ( 1995 ) , and hunter ( 1996 ) .",
    "again , the observed column densities have not been corrected for inclination or for beam  smearing effects , but the bcds , on average , have higher peak column densities than the dis .",
    "this trend may explain , or be a result of , the high rates of star formation in bcds .",
    "as recognized by searle & sargent ( 1972 ) , the defining characteristic of a bcd  a bright , compact , star burst  must be a short lived phenomenon ( see table [ tab : global ] for examples of gas depletion timescales ) .",
    "in fact , the current star  formation rate must be higher than the average past rate in these systems in order to explain their compact , low luminosity , low metallicity nature .",
    "it was thus hypothesized that these galaxies undergo episodic bursts of star formation , with the corresponding conclusion that they spend a fraction of their lifetime in a quiescent state .",
    "bcds in a quiescent state have not yet been found , however , in part due to the difficulty of identifying such objects .",
    "for instance , it is still unclear what these galaxies should look like since their high rate of star formation will presumably affect many physical properties such as the ism , total luminosity , colors , etc . nonetheless , it is natural to wonder if there may be an evolutionary link between the three main classes of low mass galaxies : di , de , and bcds ( e.g. , skillman 1996 ) .",
    "below we discuss possible evolutionary scenarios for both pre and post  bcds .",
    "in general , bcds and dis have many similar global properties , with the exception of optical surface brightness and optical size ( e.g. , hoffman 1989 ) .",
    "for instance , both dis and bcds can have large , extended hi distributions . however , in contrast to the extensive hi envelopes around many quiescent dis ( e.g. , van zee 1997b ) , the hi envelopes around bcds have many kinematic irregularities .",
    "the bcds may still be in the process of collapse , or this may be the result of their high rates of star formation .",
    "another major difference between bcds and dis is that the bcds have higher central mass concentrations in both gas and stellar content .",
    "this latter point has been the major stumbling block for simple evolution models between bcds and dis since it indicates that mass redistribution will be necessary before a bcd can fade into a di .",
    "an alternative view might be that bcds do not evolve into low surface brightness dis at all ( because of the differences in their kinematics and gas content ) , but rather that their high central mass concentrations simply are normal for these galaxies . in this scenario , one would think of dis as possessing a range in their central surface brightness / central mass densities , from very low ( e.g. , lsb dwarfs ) to very high .",
    "the galaxies we see as bcds would simply represent the extreme end of this continuum of central mass densities .",
    "the star burst activity would then be a natural consequence of the physical properties of the galaxies : objects with high central mass concentrations would preferentially be able to host and sustain a major starburst .",
    "it has also been hypothesized that bcds could evolve into des , either if the burst uses the available gas , or if the ism is disrupted as the burst evolves ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; davies & phillipps 1988 ; marlowe 1995 ; telles 1997 ) .",
    "away scenario , however , is more difficult than previously thought ( mac low & ferrara 1998 ) . furthermore , while some bcds are morphologically similar to the des , their kinematics are quite different . as ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 )",
    "emphatically state , `` dwarf ellipticals are not supported by rotation . '' admittedly , only a few des have been observed , but almost all have stellar rotation velocities less than 2  ( e.g. , ngc 185 and ngc 205 , bender 1991 ; vcc 351 , bender & nieto 1990 ) .",
    "the few exceptions ( ngc 147 , bender 1991 ; ic 794 , bender & nieto 1990 ) have rotation velocities of only 1015  which is significantly less than the rotation velocities for the bcds in this sample .",
    "interestingly , the hi gas associated with ngc 205 does have a significant velocity gradient , but this gas may have been captured recently ( young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that most des are not supported by rotation while many ( all ? ) bcds are rotation dominated .",
    "thus , loss of angular momentum would be necessary before a bcd could evolve into a de .",
    "furthermore , one additional argument against bcd to de evolution comes from environmental considerations : most des are found in clusters or as companions to massive galaxies while bcds are typically field objects .",
    "in fact , des are among the most strongly clustered galaxies known ( ferguson & sandage 1989 ) , while bcds are among the least clustered ( iovino 1988 ; salzer & rosenberg 1994 ; pustilnik 1995 ) .",
    "if the previous generation of bcds all evolved into de galaxies , it would lead to a large population of unclustered des , which is not observed to exist .",
    "note that we can not rule out the possibility that the present day des evolve through a bcd  like phase during their early evolution .",
    "rather , we suggest that the bcds we see today will not evolve into des .",
    "one solution to allow a bcd to de evolutionary scenario is to hypothesize that interactions with other galaxies can enable the bcd to lose the necessary angular momentum .",
    "interactions have also been invoked to explain the high rate of star formation in bcds ( e.g. , taylor 1993 ; taylor 1995 ; walter 1997 ) , and thus are an extremely appealing mechanism to not only explain the initiation of star  formation activity , but also the subsequent evolution of a bcd .",
    "however , based on a search for optical companions , telles & terlevich ( 1995 ) found that a significant fraction of bcds were isolated .",
    "furthermore , of the five bcds in this sample , only one ( ii  zw  40 ) is clearly the result of an interaction .",
    "thus , while an interaction is certainly one mechanism by which star formation can be enhanced in bcds , it is not the only one , and possibly not even the most common .",
    "further observational evidence will be needed to determine the ultimate fate of bcds .",
    "for instance , optical surface photometry for large , unbiased , samples of dis would be useful to determine if bcds simply form the extreme end of a continuum of di properties .",
    "the study of patterson & thuan ( 1996 ) represents a good start in this direction , but more data are needed .",
    "in addition , studies of the gas content in bcds , dis , and des would be beneficial for identification of systematic trends in gas content , and to confirm that most des are gas  poor .",
    "further , detailed studies of the mass distributions ( stellar , gas , and total ) in all types of dwarf galaxies will be necessary to determine if bcds , dis , and des form a common family .",
    "finally , kinematic studies , particularly of the stellar distributions in des , will be crucial for understanding the relationships between these fundamental classes of low mass systems .",
    "in summary , we have presented the results of high spatial resolution hi synthesis observations of five bcds .",
    "our results and conclusions are summarized below .",
    "\\(1 ) the hi distributions extend well beyond the optical system , with a typical d@xmath7/d@xmath24 of 34 . however , based on the velocity information , some of the extended gas is not in dynamical equilibrium . in fact , whereas velocity gradients were detected in all five objects , none are smoothly rotating systems .",
    "\\(3 ) detailed analysis of the hi distributions indicates that the neutral gas is clumpy on spatial scales of hundreds of parsec .",
    "as seen previously in other dwarf galaxy systems , the peak gas column densities are associated with sites of active star formation .",
    "furthermore , moderate local depressions in the neutral gas column density are associated with the most intense knots of star formation ; in these regions , the column density drops 2050% , presumably due to feedback from the star forming region .",
    "these observations have shed new light on the evolutionary connections between bcds , dis , and des . in particular , bcds appear to have intrinsically different neutral gas distributions than the more quiescent dis , perhaps explaining their higher rates of star formation .",
    "furthermore , if bcds are rotationally supported , as was found here for all five systems , bcds can not evolve into des without substantial loss of angular momentum .",
    "thus , the neutral gas kinematics and distribution place strong constraints on the feasibility of many of the popular bcd evolutionary scenarios .",

    "<S> we present the results of high spatial resolution hi observations of five intrinsically compact dwarf galaxies which are currently experiencing a strong burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the hi maps indicate that these systems have a complex and clumpy interstellar medium . unlike typical dwarf irregular galaxies , these blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) </S>",
    "<S> galaxies exhibit strong central concentrations in their neutral gas distributions which may provide a clue to the origin of their strong star  burst activity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while all of the systems do appear to be rotating , based on observed velocity gradients , the kinematics are complex . </S>",
    "<S> all systems have non  ordered kinematic structure at some level ; some of the extended gas is not necessarily kinematically connected to the main system .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed gas distributions and kinematics place constraints on evolutionary scenarios for bcds . evolutionary links between bcds , dwarf irregulars , and dwarf ellipticals have been postulated to explain their high star formation rates and low luminosity , low metallicity nature . the bcds appear to have higher central mass concentrations in both gas and stellar content than the dwarf irregulars , indicating that evolutionary scenarios connecting these two classes will require mass redistribution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the fact that bcds are rotationally supported systems indicates that bcds are unlikely to evolve into dwarf ellipticals without substantial loss of angular momentum . thus , </S>",
    "<S> while such evolutionary scenarios may still be possible with the aid of mergers or tidal interactions , the isolated nature of bcds suggests that the majority of bcds will not fade to become objects similar to the present day dwarf ellipticals .    </S>",
