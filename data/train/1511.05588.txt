    "acoustic liners are commonly used in noise control devices for duct systems .",
    "typical applications include silencers for ventilation systems , wall treatments for aircraft engines , and silencers for industrial gas turbines .",
    "to increase the liner efficiency , various strategies can be used .",
    "one is to find a new material design for which the impedance is close to the optimal value in the targeted range of frequencies@xcite .",
    "another strategy is to take advantage of the acoustic impedance changes ( like discontinuities ) in axial@xcite or circumferential@xcite segments , or both of them@xcite .",
    "the strategy used in this paper is different : the idea is to couple the incoming propagative mode in the waveguide with the modes localized in the lined region .",
    "those localized modes exist for particular values of the geometry in a uniform liner but can also be created by impedance variations .",
    "as an example , a very simple 2d model with an uniform liner is analyzed in this paper .",
    "such interferences between resonances and scattering appear in fano resonances ( for review articles see , for example , refs . and , and the references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to the conventional isolated resonances scattering , fano resonance is explained by constructive and destructive interferences between a resonance ( trapped mode ) or a complex resonance ( quasi - trapped mode ) and the background or nonresonant scattering@xcite .",
    "a transmission zero is produced as a real resonance frequency is crossed@xcite .",
    "one of the crucial ingredients to form a fano resonance is to have trapped mode with a real resonance frequency .",
    "trapped modes are localized oscillations in unbounded media and do not radiate energy to infinity .",
    "they were first observed experimentally in acoustics by parker in 1966@xcite .",
    "discrete trapped modes may exist below the first cut - off frequency of the transverse modes , provided that some kinds of defect or variations of geometry exist@xcite .",
    "discrete trapped modes may also exist above the first cut - off frequency for specific parameter combinations , they are called embedded trapped modes @xcite or bound states in continuum ( bic ) in quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "friedrich and wintgen@xcite demonstrated that bic is a natural feature of common physical situations , and can occur due to the interference of resonances .",
    "they have linked bics directly to the phenomenon of an avoided crossing of neighbored resonance states ( modes with complex eigenvalues ) .",
    "recently , bics in the vicinity of exceptional points were also found in open quantum billiards@xcite .",
    "sadreev @xmath1@xcite found that the bics are close to the points of degeneracy of the closed quantum system . when the system is opened , the degeneracies are lifted and avoided crossings occur .",
    "fano resonance scatterings in acoustics and their relations with trapped modes in waveguides including obstacles or in duct - cavity systems have been studied by hein @xmath1@xcite .",
    "they used finite - element method to compute numerically the acoustic resonances as well as transmission and reflection for an incoming duct mode .",
    "they obtained complex resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenfunctions , the homogeneous solutions of the helmholtz equation with absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the complex resonance frequencies are the positions of the poles of scattering matrix of the corresponding scattering problem .",
    "fano resonance scatterings were related to three types of trapped modes : antisymmetric ( about duct axis ) trapped modes below the first cut - off frequency , embedded trapped modes linked to avoided crossings of resonances , and trapped modes associated with fabry - prot interferences between cavities .    in this paper , we study sound propagation in a waveguide lined on a section with a locally reacting material by the resonance scattering approach@xcite .",
    "the objective is to understand the effects of mode coupling on the transmission of the lined section .",
    "we show that by varying a control parameter ( the section length or the product of the lined admittance and the frequency ) , two neighbored modes with complex resonance frequencies interfere in the scattering region : the lined section opened to the two semi - infinite waveguides . in the vicinity of an exceptional point ,",
    "where the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions coalesce , one mode turns to be trapped , the corresponding resonance frequency ( eigenvalue ) is real",
    ". a transmission zero is present in the vicinity of a resonance peak when the real resonance frequency is crossed , this is also called fano resonance ( section slowromancap3@ ) .    in section slowromancap2@",
    ", we derive the scattering matrix ( @xmath2 matrix ) .",
    "for that , we project the helmholtz equation over the eigenfunctions of the rigid closed counterpart of the _ open _ lined section which form an orthogonal and complete function basis .",
    "the used eigenfunctions include the transverse and axial components , thus this method generalizes the multimodal method@xcite in which the wave function is expanded only in terms of transverse eigenfunctions .",
    "we express the scattering matrix @xmath2 in terms of an effective matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 approximately describes the complex resonances of the _ open _ lined section .",
    "its eigenvalues are complex and give the poles of the @xmath2 matrix . with the help of its eigenfunctions , we can extend the traditional acoustic resonance scattering formula@xcite to describe the coupling effects between the _ open _ lined section and the rigid waveguide .",
    "we consider the acoustic scattering problem in a two - dimensional infinite waveguide lined over a finite length @xmath3 with a locally reacting material , as shown in fig.[figure1 ] .",
    "the waveguide is decomposed into three parts : two semi - infinite rigid waveguides @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( regions slowromancap1@ and slowromancap3@ , respectively ) , and one scattering region ( region slowromancap2@ ) .",
