    "the @xmath2 charmonium state is the lowest - mass resonance above open charmed pair threshold  @xcite .",
    "it is believed to mainly be a mixture of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 angular momentum eigenstate .",
    "this charmonium state is expected to predominately decay into the ozi allowed @xmath16 and @xmath17 final states .    however , there is a long - standing puzzle in the @xmath2 production and decays .",
    "available published data indicate that the measured values of @xmath3 production cross section at the peak of @xmath2 resonance fail to fit in the measured values of the cross section for @xmath2 production .",
    "a detail analysis of the experimental data taken at spear shows that about @xmath18 of @xmath2 does not decay into @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite ( see section ii for detail ) .",
    "some new publications about @xmath2 and @xmath3 production and decays from bes  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite and cleo  @xcite still indicate that @xmath2 is not saturated by @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays",
    ".    measurements of the branching fractions for @xmath0 can help for understanding of the decay mechanism of @xmath2 and for elucidating the exact nature of the @xmath2 .",
    "measurement of the partial width for @xmath1 decay is essential to clarify the long - standing puzzle of the @xmath2 production and decays , and is helpful for solving the @xmath19 puzzle in @xmath20 decay  @xcite .",
    "recently , bes published a preliminary result on measurement of the cross section for @xmath2 production obtained by analyzing a fine cross section scan data sets taken from 3.666 gev to 3.897 gev .",
    "based on these modern measurements for both the @xmath2 and @xmath21 production at the peak of @xmath2 resonance and the measurement of the @xmath2 resonance parameters and with making some necessary corrections for radiative effects , we can determine the branching fractions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a consistent way with the new measured parameters by bes .",
    "meanwhile we can extract the branching fraction for @xmath1 .    in this letter",
    "we report the determinations of the branching fractions .",

    "with single and double tag analysis method  @xcite , bes collaboration analyzed the invariant mass spectra of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 combinations for single tag analysis , and the mass spectra of @xmath34 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath35 combinations for double tag analysis to measure the observed cross sections for @xmath16 and @xmath17 production at @xmath23 gev .",
    "they obtained the cross sections for @xmath36 , @xmath17 and @xmath21 production at this energy point to be  @xcite @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where the first error is statistical and second systematic .",
    "these values of the cross sections are consistent with that measured by bes collaboration based on single tag analysis  @xcite , and consistent with that measured by cleo  @xcite within error .    to obtain the bare cross sections for @xmath40 , @xmath17 and @xmath21 production , the observed cross sections have to be corrected for the radiative effects .",
    "in any @xmath41 colliding beam experiment , the electron ( positron ) always radiates at the interaction point because of the potential of the positron ( electron ) .",
    "since this radiation ( bremsstrahlung ) carries energy away , the actual center - of - mass energy for the @xmath41 annihilation is reduced by bremsstrahlung to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the total energy of the emitted photons .",
    "the bremsstrahlung is principally responsible for the distortions to the bare resonance line shape , while the self energy of the electron and positron and the vertex corrections to the initial state affect the overall factors to change the scale of the cross section .",
    "all of these corrections are called initial state radiation ( isr ) corrections . the bare cross section for @xmath3 production at the energy of 3.773 gev",
    "can be obtained by correcting the observed cross section for the effects of the isr and vacuum polarization .",
    "the observed cross section , @xmath44 , at the nominal energy @xmath45 can be written as a convolution of the bare cross section @xmath46 and a sampling function @xmath47  @xcite  @xcite , @xmath48 in which the @xmath49 is due to the photon vacuum polarization , the @xmath50 is the photon vacuum polarization operator including the loops over leptons ( @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) and hadrons  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the @xmath2 resonance in this analysis , we take the @xmath54 to be the bare breit - wigner cross section as given in eq . ( 1 ) , where @xmath55 is chosen to be energy dependent and normalized to the total width @xmath56 at the peak of the resonance  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 is defined as  @xcite   @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the momentum of the @xmath59 mesons produced at the peak of @xmath2 , @xmath60 is the momentum of the @xmath59 mesons produced at the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath45 , @xmath56 is the width of the @xmath2 at the peak , and @xmath61 is the interaction radius which was set to be 0.5 fm in the analysis . in the calculation of the bare cross section , the @xmath2 resonance parameters @xmath62 mev ; @xmath63 mev and @xmath64 kev measured by bes collaboration  @xcite were used .",
    "the @xmath2 width ( @xmath65 mev ) is much large than the energy spread ( @xmath66 mev ) of the bepc .",
    "so the effect of the beam energy spread on the cross section could be ignored .",
    "the @xmath2 is generally assumed to decay exclusively into @xmath3 .",
    "taking these considerations , the observed cross section of eq .",
    "( 12 ) should be replaced by @xmath67 in calculation of the radiative corrections .",
    "the correction factor for the radiative effects is given by @xmath68 figure 2 shows the factor of the radiative corrections as a function of the nominal center - of - mass energy . at the center - of - mass energy @xmath69 ,",

    "the systematic uncertainties in luminosity measurement and in the radiative correction factor are canceled in the determinations of the branching fractions . using the total width of @xmath2 resonance @xmath83 mev measured by the bes collaboration",
    ", this branching fraction corresponds to a partial width of @xmath84 where the first error is statistical and second systematic arising from the uncertainty in the measured branching fraction for @xmath85 and the uncertainty in the measured total width of @xmath2 resonance .",

    "based on the recent publications about @xmath2 and @xmath21 production and decays from bes collaboration and with making some necessary corrections for initial state radiative and vacuum polarization effects , we determined the branching fractions for @xmath88 to be @xmath89 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively .",
