    "relativistic heavy ion collisions can produce high temperature and high density matter containing roughly equal numbers of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the environment is uniquely suited for production of light antinuclei , including @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and anti - hypernuclei .    during the 2010 rhic runs , with",
    "upgraded readout electronics for the time projection chamber ( tpc)@xcite and fully installed barrel time of flight ( tof)@xcite , star is in a good position to study the production of antimatter nuclei . in this paper , we report the measurement of @xmath0  nucleus@xcite at star .",
    "approximately 10@xmath1 au+au collisions taken by tpc in 2007 and by tpc and tof in 2010 are used in this analysis .",
    "preferential selection of events containing tracks with charge @xmath8 was implemented using a high - level trigger ( hlt ) for data acquired in 2010 .",
    "a new variable , @xmath9 , is defined as @xmath9 = @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the expected value@xcite for a given particle spice , @xmath12 is the resolution of @xmath13 ) for particle identification .",
    "hlt performs an online fast track reconstruction to select events that have at least one track with @xmath13 , @xmath14 -3 .",
    "the hlt identifies 70% of charge-2 tracks by selecting 0.4% of the total events for express analysis .",
    "tpc is able to reconstruct charged tracks between @xmath151.8 units of pseudo - rapidity with full azimuthal angle .",
    "tracks between pseudo - rapidity @xmath151 are used for this analysis .",
    "collisions are required to have primary vertex position within 30 cm from the center of tpc along beam line direction , and have a less than 3 cm difference between z vertex reconstructed by vertex position detector ( vpd ) and tpc .",
    "particle identification can be achieved by correlating the ionization energy loss @xmath16 of charged particles in tpc gas with their measured magnetic rigidity .",
    "a set of selection criteria is employed to get a clean separation between different particle species , including at least 25 ionized electron clusters of tracks in tpc , more than 15 clusters for @xmath16 calculation , and the distance of closest approach ( dca ) between tracks and primary vertex less than 3 cm for negative particles ( less than 0.5 cm for positive particles ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dedxvsrigidity ] shows @xmath13 versus rigidity ( @xmath17 ) distribution . a distinct band centered around the expected value@xcite for @xmath18he   particles",
    "is shown in the right panel . in the left panel , where @xmath17 is less than 1.4 gev / c",
    ", 4 @xmath0   particles are located within the expected band for @xmath0   and well separated from the @xmath7   band .",
    "in addition to the mean energy loss per unit track length @xmath16 in the tpc gas and the momentum provided by the track curvature in the magnetic field , the measurement of @xmath0  relies on the time of flight of particles arriving at the tof surrounding the tpc . in higher momentum region , a combination of @xmath13 and mass from tof measurement via @xmath19 (",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the time of flight and path length for @xmath0  , respectively ) is used for particle identification .",
    "an improved signal to background ratio is furthermore achieved by additional selection criteria on the track extrapolations to the tof hits .",
    "figure [ fig : m2vsnsigma ] shows the @xmath9 versus mass distribution . in the top and bottle panel , the majority species are @xmath7  and @xmath22he , and there are @xmath0  and @xmath18he  particles around @xmath23 and @xmath24 = 3.47 gev@xmath25 .",
    "other particles in these two panels are @xmath22h and @xmath6 . in total , 18 counts for @xmath0  are observed : 16 have been reconstructed from au+au collisions in 2010 , and 2 counts have been identified by @xmath13 alone from data recorded in 2007 .",
    "the latter are not included in this plot because the star tof was not installed at that time .",
    "the mass distribution of @xmath7  may extend to @xmath0  selection area because of the finite tof timing resolution , thus contributing to the background of @xmath0 .",
    "we reproduce @xmath7  mass distribution with each track s expected time of flight smeared by time deviation ( @xmath26 ) of other tracks from the same data sample .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows the mass distribution for charge-2 tracks from real data ( left panel ) and reproduced @xmath7  mass distribution ( right panel ) .",
    "then , we obtain the background by integrating reproduced @xmath7  mass distribution over the cut window ( 3.35 gev/@xmath27 mass @xmath28 4.04 gev/@xmath29 ) of the @xmath0   selection .",
    "we estimate that the background contributes 1.4 and 0.05 counts of the 15 and 1 counts from the au+au collisions at 200 and 62 gev , respectively .",
    "therefore , the probability of misidentification is calculated in the way of poisson distribution@xcite and is at the @xmath30 level .",
    "we present the observation of @xmath0   nucleus at star . in total , 18 @xmath0  counts have been detected .",
    "of those , 2 of them were identified by tpc alone with data recorded 2007 , 15 and 1 were identified by both tpc and tof from 2010 au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev and 62 gev with backgrounds of 1.4 and 0.05 .",
