    "most of the early x - ray afterglows detected by swift ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) show a steep decay phase around 100@xmath01000 seconds after the burst trigger ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "the main characteristics of this steep decay phase include the following .",
    "( 1 ) it connects smoothly to the prompt @xmath1-ray light curve extrapolated to the x - ray band , suggesting that it is the `` tail '' of the prompt emission ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 , obrien et 2006 , liang et al 2006 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the decay slope is typically @xmath2 when choosing the grb trigger time as the zero time point @xmath3 ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al . 2006 ; zhang et al 2006 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the time - averaged spectral index of the steep decay phase is much different from that of the later shallow decay phase , indicating that it is a distinct new component that is unrelated to the conventional afterglow components ( zhang et al 2006 ; liang et al .",
    "( 4 ) strong spectral evolution exists in about one third of the bursts that have a steep decay phase ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter zlz07 ; butler & kocevski 2007 ; starling et al .",
    "all these features suggest that the steep decay phase holds the key to understand the connection between the prompt emission ( internal ) phase and the traditional afterglow ( external ) phase . any proposed model ( see mszros 2006 ; zhang 2007 for reviews ) should be able to explain these features .",
    "the so called `` curvature effect '' , which accounts for the delayed photon emission from high latitudes with respect to the line of sight upon the abrupt cessation of emission in the prompt emission region ( fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; dermer 2004 ; dyks et al . 2005 ; qin 2008a ) , has been suggested to play an important role in shaping the sharp flux decline in grb tails ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; liang et al . 2006",
    "; wu et al . 2006 ; yamazaki et al . 2006 ) . in the simplest model , it is assumed that the instantaneous spectrum at the end of the prompt emission is a simple power law with a spectral index @xmath4 .",
    "the predicted temporal decay index of the emission is ( with the convention @xmath5 ) @xmath6 if the time origin to define the @xmath7 light curve , @xmath3 , is taken as the beginning of the last emission episode before the cessation of emission . adopting a time - averaged @xmath4 in the tails , liang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that eq.([curvature-1 ] ) is generally valid .",
    "the strong spectral evolution identified in a group of grb tails ( zlz07 ) apparently violates eq.([curvature-1 ] ) , which is valid only for a constant @xmath4 .",
    "zlz07 then investigated a curvature effect model by assuming a structured jet with varying @xmath4 at different latitudes and that the line of sight is near the jet axis .",
    "one would then expect that eq.([curvature-1 ] ) is roughly satisfied , with both @xmath8 and @xmath4 being time - dependent .",
    "zlz07 found that this model does not fit the data well .",
    "these facts do not rule out the curvature effect interpretation of grb tails , however .",
    "this is because the instantaneous spectrum upon the cessation of prompt emission may not be a simple power law .",
    "if the spectrum has a curvature , as the emission from progressively higher latitudes reach the observer , the xrt band is sampling different segments of the intrinsic curved spectrum ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this would introduce an apparent spectral evolution in the decaying tail .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to test this more general curvature effect model using the available swift xrt data .",
    "we consider a general non - power - law spectrum in the form of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the function form of the spectrum with a characteristic frequency @xmath11 so that @xmath12=1 , and @xmath13 is the normalization of the spectrum at @xmath14 .",
    "the curvature effect states that given a same spectrum at different latitudes with respect to the line of sight , one has @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the doppler factor . if the high - latitude angle @xmath18 , the dopper factor @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) . considering the @xmath3 effect ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; liang et al .",
    "2006 ) , this can be written as @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 , where @xmath3 refers to the time origin of the last pulse in the prompt emission and @xmath25 is the epoch when the curvature - effect decay starts ( or the `` peak '' time of the lightcurve ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "notice that in the case of @xmath28 ( a pure power law spectrum ) , one derives @xmath29 .",
    "this is the relation eq.([curvature-1 ] ) .",
    "we consider several physically motivated non - powerlaw spectra with a characteristic frequency @xmath11 , including the cut - off power law spectrum and the band - function ( band et al .",

    ", we also investigate different forms of the cutoffs with varying sharpness . in all cases , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 follow eqs.([fe ] ) and ( [ ep ] ) .",
    "when @xmath32 drops across an observational narrow energy band , e.g. the swift / xrt band , it introduces an apparent spectral softening with time , which , if fitted by a power law , shows an increase of photon index with time . in the meantime ,",
    "the flux within the observing band drops down rapidly , leading to an apparent steep decay phase in the lightcurve ( fig.1 ) .",

    "usually @xmath25 can be reasonably fixed to the end of the prompt emission .",

    ", the model spectrum can be determined once these parameters are given .",
    "one can then confront the model with the real grb data .",
    "the procedure includes the following steps .",
    "( 1 ) for a given burst , we extract its swift / xrt light curve and @xmath62 slices of time - dependent spectra using the standard heasoft / swift package .",
    "the details of the data reduction method were described in zlz07 .",
    "( 2 ) given a trial set of parameters in the theoretical spectra is fixed to a certain value for a particular model , and is varied when different models are explored . ]",
    "\\{@xmath33 , @xmath60 , @xmath35 , @xmath3 } , using eqs.([eqmain]-[ec ] ) we model @xmath62 time - dependent _ theoretical spectra _ that correspond to the time bins that are used to derive the time - dependent observed spectra .",
    "( 3 ) based on the theoretical spectra of each time slice , we simulate the corresponding _ model spectra _ by taking account of the observational effects , including the swift / xrt response matrix , the absorption column densities ( @xmath63 ) of both the milky way ( extracted from the observations from step 1 ) and the host galaxy of the burst ( a free parameter ) , the redshift ( if applicable ) , and a poisson noise background . notice that @xmath64 is another parameter introduced in the model spectra ( besides the other parameters introduced in the theoretical spectra ) .",
    "all these faked spectra can be obtained using heasoft ( version 6.4 ) and xspec ( version 12.4 ) ( 4 ) we fit the faked model spectra with a simple power law model , i.e. @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 if the redsift is available ) in xspec and get the simulated fluxes and spectral indices of the @xmath62 slices . here",
    "the column densities of both the milk way and the host galaxy are fixed to the obsered values as in step 1 .",
    "( 5 ) we compare the simulated fluxes and spectral indices with the observed ones and access the goodness of the fits using @xmath38 statistics .",
    "( 6 ) we refine the trial set of parameters based on the comparison and repeat steps ( 2)-(5 ) when necessary .",
    "we test whether we can reach a set of best - fitting parameters that can reproduce both the light curve and the apparent spectral evolution as observed .",
    "we apply the method to grb050814 , a typical burst with well - observed x - ray tail with strong spectral evolution .",
    "as seen in fig.2 , the tail has a steep decay index of @xmath67 , and a strong spectral evolution is apparent at @xmath68 s. these features are common in most of the grb x - ray tails .",
    "we first fix @xmath69 in eq .",
    "[ eqmain ] , which corresponds to the simplest cutoff powerlaw model .",
    "the initial trial parameters we choose are ( @xmath35 , @xmath33 , @xmath3 , @xmath70 , @xmath64 ) @xmath71 .",
    "the peak time @xmath25 is fixed to 143.6 s , which corresponds to the end of the prompt emission .",
    "some idl scripts are developed to follow the procedure described in  3 to automatically search for the best - fit parameters to match both the observed light curve and the time - dependent spectral index .",
    "the final best - fitting parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "the corresponding simulated light curve ( black curve ) and spectral indices ( green curve ) are shown in fig.2 .",
    "figure 2 suggests that the sharp decay and the spectral evolution in the tail of grb 050814 can be indeed explained by the curvature effect with a cutoff power law spectrum . in fig.3",
    "we present the comparison between the simualted and observed spectra in the time steps 1 and 6 ( as examples ) , which show reasonable consistency .",
    "our model predicts that the prompt emission spectrum at @xmath72 s should be a cut - off power law with the parameters in table 1 . in order to confirm this ,",
    "we subtract the bat - band spectrum in the time interval @xmath73 s , and compare with the data with the model prediction . as shown in fig.4 , the bat data is roughly consistent with the model prediction , suggesting the validity of the model .",
    "some physical parameters can be constrained according to our model .",
    "the time interval from @xmath25 to the beginning of the steep decay phase @xmath74 may be related to the angular spreading time scale @xmath75 .",
    "noticing @xmath76 for grb050814 ( jakobsson et al . 2005 ) , we can estimate the lorentz factor of the fireball as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the normalized emission radius .",
    "since we know the spectral peak energy @xmath79 at @xmath25 , we can also estimate the corresponding electrons lorentz factor for synchrotron emission by @xmath80^{1/2 } \\sim 2.4\\times 10 ^ 3 r_{15}^{-1/4}b_3^{-1/2}$ ] . from the rest frame duration of the x - ray tail we are analyzing @xmath81 s",
    ", one can constrain the minimum jet opening angle as @xmath82 .",
    "these values are generally consistent with those derived from various other methods .",
    "we find that the abruptness parameter @xmath50 can not be very different from unity .",
    "a band - function spectrum introduces a less significant spectral evolution and it can not reproduce the data ( cf .",
    "qin 2008b ) .",
    "we have successfully modeled the lightcurve and spectral evolution of the x - ray tail of grb050814 using the curvature effect model of a cutoff power law spectrum with an exponential cutoff ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it has been discussed in the literature ( e.g. fan & wei 2005 ; barniol - duran & kumar 2008 ) that the grb central engine may not die abruptly , and that the observed x - ray tails may reflect the dying history of the central engine .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the strong spectral evolution in the x - ray tails would demand a time - dependent particle acceleration mechanism that gives a progressively soft particle spectrum .",
    "such a behavior has not been predicted by particle acceleration theories .",
    "our results suggest that at least for some tails , the spectral evolution is simply a consequence of the curvature effect : the observer views emission from the progressively higher latitudes from the line of sight , so that the xrt band is sampling the different segments of a curved spectrum .",
    "this is a simpler interpretation .",
    "the phenomenology of the x - ray tails are different from case to case ( zlz07 ) .",
    "we have applied our model to some other clean x - ray tails , such as grb050724 , grb080523 , and find that they can be also interpreted by this model .",
    "some other tails have superposed x - ray flares , making a robust test of the model difficult .",
    "a systematic survey of all the data sample is needed to address what fraction of the bursts can be interpreted in this way or they demand other physically distinct models ( e.g. barniol - duran & kumar 2008 ; dado et al .",
