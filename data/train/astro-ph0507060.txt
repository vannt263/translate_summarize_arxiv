    "the morphological classification of galaxies , which assigns galaxies discrete classes in the form of a tuning - fork diagram ( the so called hubble sequence , sandage 1961 ) , allows us to quantify the basic features of galaxies and to relate them to the galaxies formation and evolution histories . while the hubble classification is based on the visual inspection of images of galaxies , and therefore necessarily involves subjective elements , it provides a basis for many extragalactic studies ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ; dressler 1994 ) . with the advancement of digitized galaxy surveys , it is highly desirable to develop a fast , automated method of morphological classification applicable to large data samples , without loosing the accuracy of the traditional visual classification .",
    "the typical approaches employed for morphological classification are to apply artificial neural networks @xcite , and characterizations with simple surface photometric parameters @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the photometric parameters for the morphological classification of galaxies using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al . 2000 ; early data release , stoughton et al .",

    "the simplest indicator often used in the literature is the parameter that characterizes the concentration of light towards the center of galaxies @xcite .",

    "but we call it `` concentration index '' throughout this work.]@xmath2 using two equivalent radii of the elliptic isophotes .",
    "they show that early- and late - type galaxies are reasonably well separated in isophotal photometry , if surface brightness is used as a second parameter .",
    "@xcite introduced a rotational asymmetry parameter @xmath3 in addition to @xmath4 that is defined using the flux measured in elliptical apertures .",
    "the rotational asymmetry parameter allows for efficient discrimination between irregular and spiral galaxies .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram has been used as a tool to classify morphology of distant galaxies observed with the hst ( e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; brinchmann et al .",
    "@xcite discusses the evolution of the structure of galaxies using @xmath7 parameter calculated from the residual image , which indicates the power at high spatial frequencies in the disk of the galaxy . @xcite and @xcite showed that the concentration index , calculated using circular isophotes as part of the standard sdss pipeline reductions ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , correlates fairly well with morphological type and can be used for classification into early and late galaxy types .",
    "the success rate of these approaches , with reference to visual inspection , is approximately @xmath8% .    in this paper , we use the sdss data release 1 ( dr1 , abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) imaging data of 1421 galaxies selected from the sdss early data release ( edr , sthoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) and early commissioning data to improve the success rate of morphological classifiers by introducing additional photometric parameters .",
    "first , we consider the performance of the standard circular - aperture concentration index , with particular emphasis on the cases where the classification fails .",
    "we proceed to employ the elliptical definition of doi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the measurement of isophotal and aperture fluxes and compare the success rate to that obtained using the circular definition .",
    "we also introduce a new texture parameter to help our classification .",
    "the motivation for this approach is that , in the visual classification , we mainly resort to surface brightness texture , such as properties of spiral arms , clumpiness , and hii regions , in addition to the concentration of light towards the galaxy center",
    ". the only work that we are aware of that discusses texture parameters as a classifier is that by @xcite .",
    "they proposed `` blobbiness '' , `` isophotal center displacement '' and `` skeleton ratio '' parameters , which correspond to roughness , global asymmetries and more localized structure , respectively .",
    "these parameters correlate with galaxy morphology and may be useful for classification , but our own tests show that they do not enhance the success rate of the classifier .",
    "our texture parameter  coarseness",
    " describes the structure of the outer galaxy isophotes , emulating the method employed in visual classification .",
    "the flux fluctuations are computed along elliptical circumferences in order to characterize the galaxy profile s departure from smoothness .",
    "the coarseness parameter is defined as the ratio of the range of fluctuations in surface brightness along the elliptic circumference to the full dynamic range of surface brightness of the galaxy . in this study",

    "similarly the @xmath178 contamination is @xmath142% , @xmath194% , and @xmath195% , for the @xmath4 , @xmath26 , and @xmath51 parameter classification , respectively .",
    "the classification with @xmath51 again produces the best result .",
    "we also note that the gain attained with the use of elliptical apertures over circular apertures is small for @xmath177 and @xmath178 , although the @xmath26 parameter gives generally better performance , if slight .",
    "one might question why the gain with @xmath26 over @xmath4 is rather small in contrast to the emphasis given in the previous section that using @xmath26 parameter removed the effect of inclination .",
    "the reason is that early and late spiral galaxies are not well separated in the concentration parameter space , and show large dispersion with heavy overlaps .",
    "so the effect of inclination does not play a crucial role .",
    "in fact , visual separation into early and late spirals relies more on the opening of spiral arms and texture .",
    "it is important to note that contaminants from late spirals to the early - type sample , or vice versa , are very small , less than @xmath196% , at least with the @xmath26 and @xmath51 indices .",
    "most of the contaminants in the e+s0 sample are from s0a and sa galaxies .",
    "finally , we examine how the performance of our morphology classifier improves by considering 2-dimensional classification in the @xmath26-@xmath51 space .",
    "the result is shown in table [ 3x3tbl_2 ] .",
    "the completeness of the sa+sb galaxy sample is @xmath197% , a 2% increase , compared with the value found employing @xmath51 alone .",
    "the contamination in the @xmath177 sample from e+s0 galaxies and late - type spiral galaxies decreases to @xmath198% , which is 5% smaller than the value obtained by using @xmath51 alone .",
    "the contamination in the early - type spiral sample still primarily arises from late - type spiral galaxies , rather than e+s0 galaxies .",
    "the contamination in the @xmath178 sample decreases from 17.9% to 17.2% .",
    "we started by examining the standard concentration index @xmath199 , defined using the petrosian flux in circular apertures , and found that the correlation is significantly affected by galaxy inclination .",
    "the value of the standard concentration index @xmath4 of a highly inclined spiral is artificially reduced ( i.e. the galaxy appears to have more centrally concentrated light ) and the galaxy is misclassified as an early type .",
    "we found that this inclination dependence vanishes if we define the concentration index using elliptical apertures .",
    "the ellipse - based concentration index @xmath26 calculated from the petrosian flux gives an inclination - independent indicator .",
    "in addition , we devised a new texture parameter , @xmath51 , that represents the coarseness of surface brightness .",
    "the @xmath51 parameter measures the texture of a galaxy disk in relation to the galaxy s overall surface brightness contrast ( including the galaxy bulge ) .",
    "it is defined in a manner that closely mimics visual classification . late type spiral galaxies ( which often show distinct spiral arms ) or magellanic type irregulars ( whose disks are less pronounced but so are their bulges ) both have large @xmath51 values , in contrast to early type galaxies .",
    "we found that the @xmath51 parameter of a galaxy is strongly correlated with its visual morphology .",
    "we investigated the performance of the three different photometric parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath26 , and @xmath51 ) for morphological classification into two ( e+s0 and sa+sb+sc+sdm+im ) or three ( e+s0 , sa+sb , and sc+sdm+im ) galaxy types . in both cases we found that the elliptical aperture classifier , @xmath26 , is better than the standard circular aperture classifier , @xmath4",
    "the coarseness parameter , @xmath51 , produces results superior to those obtained with either of the concentration index parameters .",
    "depending on the desired balance between completeness and contamination , sample completeness as high as 88% or contamination as low as 12% is achievable .",
    "we can further improve the classification by considering 2-dimensional ( using the @xmath26-@xmath51 plane ) classification . in the case of classification into two morphological types , this allows us to attain a 89% completeness and contamination as low as 12% .",
    "for classification into three morphological types , the completeness is 68% .",
    "our newly devised photometric parameter , coarseness , provides a mode of morphological classification as good as the traditionally used human - eye classification . at the same time",
    ", it is fully automated , and thus , can be used quite easily for millions of galaxies .",
    "therefore , the coarseness parameter presented in this paper has a potential to open new doors to detailed studies of galaxy morphology in current and future large ccd surveys .",
