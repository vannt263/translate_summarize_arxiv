    "the number of grbs with early - time light curves and spectroscopically determined redshift has increased dramatically over the last 18 months .",
    "thus , in addition to important recent results such as the detection of short burst afterglows and the observation of the most distant ( z@xmath26 ) grb observed to date  @xcite ) , the following facts are emerging : _ a ) _ a higher mean redshift ( @xmath9 ) for swift grbs  @xcite compared with those detected in the pre - swift era ( @xmath10  @xcite ) ; _ b ) _",

    "the growing evidence for continued activity of the central engine , the detailed physics of which remains elusive , and the opportunity to probe the interaction of expanding shells with the circumburst / interstellar medium , particularly at high redshift , demand dedicated prompt followup observing programs .",
    "large robotic telescopes such as the 2-m liverpool telescope are optimised for such followup and are proving effective  @xcite .",
    "early afterglow light curves exhibit a considerable variety and rebrightenings ( hereafter called _ bumps _ ) are becoming more frequently observed .",
    "grb  021004 @xcite remains one of the best studied events ( @xmath11 ) and a number of different models have been invoked to explain its temporal behaviour : variable density profile  @xcite , passage of the break frequency  @xcite , refreshed shocks @xcite , angular dependence of the energy profile on the jet structure @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is grb  030329 ( @xmath12 ) , preferably modeled according to the refreshed shocks ( late energy - injections ) scenario @xcite . in this case , initially slower shells catch up with the external shock front , which , in the meantime , is decelerating due to the interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "the early afterglow of grb  050502a ( @xmath13 ) exhibited a smooth decay , well - fitted by a power - law with index @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , followed by a an achromatic bump emerging at @xmath16 that has been interpreted by @xcite as due to density clumps in a uniform medium .",
    "more recently , an increasing number of events , in particular at high - z , exhibit rebrightenings @xcite .",
    "these observations support the hypothesis such behaviour might not be unusual .",

    "the @xmath45 segment accounts for the sharp , earliest bump occurring at @xmath5 and the subsequent decay .",
    "the next segment describes three r points lying at @xmath46 .",
    "however , this fit at 2000s is not unique as one may also fit the flattening of the curve around this time with @xmath47 , beginning immediately after @xmath48 .",
    "although this scenario may seem simpler than introducing a bump component via @xmath49 , assuming an achromatic flattening in the @xmath25 band curve for @xmath50 ( constrained by @xmath25 sampling ) would in turn imply a rebrightening in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this confirms that a bump is required in this time interval . in our analytical model",
    "the bump time is arbitrarily fixed to @xmath53 , and the shape fixed by the earliest case template .",
    "the only variable is the peak flux @xmath54 that is in any case non significantly affected by @xmath55 . in other words , a small rebrightening at @xmath56",
    "is necessary because it is not possible to fit the light curve in all 3 colors ( @xmath1 ) without including a bump at that time .",
    "the next segments , @xmath57 provide a good fit to the biggest double - peaked bump ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "most importantly , the cosmological time dilation @xmath60 implies that the intense activity described so far took place in less than 15 minutes in the rest frame . the last feature before the final break , possibly associated to a density variation , takes place at @xmath61 and is well described by the @xmath62 term . in absence of a systematic photometric sampling close to the late break ( @xmath63 )",
    ", we fitted the @xmath64 _ mdm _ points with a simple , independent power - law .",
    "the analytical model validity is thus limited to @xmath65 , before the occurrence of the inferred break .",

    "we note that these values differ slightly from those found by @xcite who derived @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "the difference is to be attributed probably to the @xmath62 bump that is recognized as a separate feature in our view , but included in the general pre - bump slope in @xcite . that late break nature",

    "+ the analytical model fit was performed separately in three different time ranges : @xmath72 ( @xmath73 degrees of freedom ) , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 @xmath76 ) .",
    "since the fit parameters are common , the procedure is iterated to let them converge to the same values in the three intervals .",

    "the @xmath25 flux is slightly affected , according to @xcite , by the deep damped lyman alpha _ dla _ absorption feature .",

    ", we remark that the simple rescaling described in footnote is again able to account for the @xmath51 points calculated during the big bump rising slope .",
    "this might be a possible indication , even if not conclusive , that the _ sed _ is already relaxed before the bump reaches its peak .    in figure",

    "both are back - extrapolated according to an @xmath105 temporal slope ( table  [ tab : fittime ] ) . at this late time , already on the smooth side of the afterglow , the ir - x fluxes ( @xmath106 ) are well fitted by a common @xmath107 power - law ( @xmath108 ) .",

    "a summary of the spectral results is given in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "after the remarkable rebrightening at @xmath113hr and before the break around @xmath114 s , the optical flux is described by a single power law with @xmath115 , except small wiggles .",
    "this indicates that the blast wave radiating the afterglow had a significant transition from one blandford - mckee ( bm ; blandford&mckee 1976 ) solution to another bm solution around @xmath116 hr .",
    "since blast wave solutions depend only on two parameters ( explosion energy and ambient density ) possible scenarios are energy injection ( rees & mszros 1998 ; kumar & piran 2000 ; sari & mszros 2000 ) and a density - jump medium ( ramirez - ruiz et al . 2001 ; dai & lu 2002 ) . the degeneracy is broken by the x - ray observations . since there is no signature of the cooling break in the decay phase of the x - ray afterglow ( morris et 2006 ) , the x - ray band is likely to be located above the cooling frequency at @xmath117 hr .",
    "this implies a high ambient density , consistent with spectroscopic determinations @xcite .",
    "the late time break in the optical light curve also favors @xmath118 at @xmath113 hr as we will discuss below .",
    "if the x - ray band is above the cooling frequency , the flux does not depend on the ambient density @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that the x - ray rebrightening is not due to a jump in the ambient density .    according to @xcite , in the absence of a density enhancement ,",
    "the flux depends on the explosion energy as :    @xmath119    since the optical flux increased by a factor of @xmath120 , the rebrightening indicates there was a huge impulsive energy injection @xmath121 at @xmath113 hr where @xmath122 is the blast wave energy right before the rebrightening .",
    "a typical p=2.3 value is assumed for the power - law distribution of electrons energies .",
    "consistently with observations ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) , the x - ray flux is expected to increase by a factor of 3 . a rather smooth transition from one solution to the other at most wavelengths is expected . however ,",
    "this is not the case at frequencies for which there is significant emission from the reverse shock ( kumar & piran 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2000 ) .",
    "the sharp rise of the rebrightening implies that the typical frequency of the reverse shock is close to the optical band .",
    "the small wiggles before or after the major rebrightening can be explained by additional minor energy injection or density clumps in the ambient medium .",
    "the energy injection is probably due to a decrease in the lorentz factor of the outflow toward the end of the prompt grb .",
    "this slow outflow collides with a blast wave when the blast wave have slowed down as a result of sweeping up the ambient material .",
    "energy injection could also be caused by a long lasting activity of the central engine ( burrows et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the energy in the blast wave at late times ( @xmath123 ) is larger than that at the deceleration time by more than a factor of @xmath124 .",
    "this requires the prompt gamma - ray emission process ( internal shocks ) to be more efficient than previously considered  @xcite .",
    "the optical light curve of grb 060206 steepened from @xmath125 to @xmath126 around @xmath127  s. although this steepening resembles a jet break , the x - ray light curve from @xmath128 s to @xmath129 s remains consistent with a single unbroken power law decay with @xmath130 ( morris et al 2006 ) .",
    "this clearly contradicts the monochromatic break predication by the jet model . in the wind model",
    "@xmath131 @xcite , the cooling frequency @xmath132 increases as a function of time @xmath133 .",
    "the passage of the cooling frequency can produce a steepening of @xmath134 in the optical band first and in the x - ray later .",
    "the observed steepening @xmath135 gives @xmath136 .",
    "the cooling frequency rapidly increases as @xmath137 , and it will cross the x - ray band around @xmath138 s. the observed unbroken power law x - ray light curve up to @xmath139 s is consistent .",
    "however , this scenario does not account for the difference of the decay indices between the pre - break optical ( @xmath140 ) and the x - ray ( @xmath141 ) light curves , which should be on the same spectral segment and the decay rates should be identical to be consistent with the scenario .",
    "a possible solution is that a blast wave initially propagates into a constant density medium @xmath142 , and around @xmath143 s it breaks out in a wind - type @xmath144 medium . using the isotropic gamma - ray energy about @xmath145ergs ( palmer et al .",
    "2006 ) , the transition radius is estimated in equation ( 5 ) in which @xmath146 and @xmath147 protons @xmath148 :    @xmath149    although a large amount of energy is injected to the fireball after the prompt emission , the energy dependence of @xmath150 is rather weak . in this scenario ,",
    "the order of the break and observational frequencies remains as @xmath151 after the major re - brightening @xmath152 hr . during the constant medium phase , the time and frequency dependences of the optical and x - ray flux are given by equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) respectively ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) :    @xmath153    with the standard value of @xmath154 these give reasonable fits to the observational decay indices , while the estimated optical spectral index @xmath155 is slightly shallower than the observations @xmath156 .",
    "moreover , a spectral break is not directly inferred between optical and x - ray that seem to lie on a single slope . however , as explained in the previous section , the predicted @xmath155 value is not significantly ruled out when a broken power - law is invoked .",
    "when the blast wave propagates into a wind medium , as the ambient density decreases , the optical flux drops as @xmath157 where @xmath158 for p=2.3 and s=2.5 .",
    "since the x - ray band is above the cooling frequency , its flux does not depend on the ambient density , and the x - ray decay index does not change before and after the break - out . considering the scaling between the observer time and blast wave radius @xmath159 ,",
    "the steep segment of the optical light curve requires that the ambient density should behave as @xmath160 between @xmath150 and @xmath161 .",
    "the steepening from @xmath105 to @xmath162 in the optical light curve looks like a typical jet break .",
    "the x - ray light - curve , however , shows no sign of a change in decay slope .",
    "this conflicts with the jet break potential interpretation based on the optical light - curve . in most previous events , x - ray data",
    "are not available at the `` jet breaks '' , and the breaks are interpreted based on optical data . the current estimate on the jet opening angle distribution",
    "might be biased by events like grb 060206 .",
    "consequently , the grb explosion energy distribution and the event rates may need to be reviewed .",
    "we presented a comprehensive study of the high redshift grb  060206 based on early robotic observations , later published photometry , gcn circulars and swift public data .",
    "the composite monochromatic light - curve is exceptionally well sampled and extremely structured .",
    "an early , @xmath163 rebrightening suggests internal engine activity ( internal shocks ) continuing well beyond the gamma prompt emission .",
    "later on , a high - significance _ sed _ evolution is inferred from multi ",
    "color @xmath1 photometry carried out by the liverpool telescope ; this is probably associated with another pre - bump rebrightening .",
    "one hour after the grb a significant , steep double - peaked rebrightening occurred , increasing the flux by a factor @xmath164 with respect to the pre - bump values .",
    "we interpret the cause of this rebrightening to be due to a late - time energy injection .",
    "the energy in the blast wave at late time ( @xmath165 ) is a factor of 2.8 larger than that at the deceleration time , implying a higher internal shock efficiency than previously considered . following the big bump ,",
    "a rather typical spectral / temporal afterglow behaviour is observed , with a possible density variation feature superimposed on the smooth power - law decay .",
    "we interpret the fact that the steepening in the optical light - curve observed at @xmath63 post - burst is not matched by similar behaviour in the x - ray as due to a transition in the density distribution of the ambient medium , likely from a constant density medium to a wind medium . in the absence of x - ray data",
    "the observed optical steepening would have been interpreted as a typical jet - break . since most of the so far observed jet - breaks lack corresponding x - ray confirmation",

    "<S> the 2-m robotic liverpool telescope ( _ lt _ ) reacted promptly to the high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) gamma  ray burst grb  060206 . the afterglow was identified automatically and multicolor @xmath1 imaging program was triggered without human intervention . combining our data with those obtained from later follow - ups provides a well - sampled optical light - curve from 5  minutes to @xmath22d after the gamma event . </S>",
    "<S> the light - curve is highly structured with at least three bumps evident in the first 75 minutes , including a major rebrightening ( @xmath3 at @xmath4 ) , interpreted as late energy injection . at early time ( @xmath5 ) , we find evidence for fast ( @xmath6 ) variability , indicating on - going internal - engine activity . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that a low redshift grb ( @xmath7 ) with similar intrinsic properties would have been interpreted completely differently due to undersampling of the light curve in the rest frame at early times ; the light - curve behaviour of grb  060206 should therefore not be considered peculiar . </S>",
    "<S> finally , although the observed late - time steepening of the optical light curve resembles a jet break if taken in isolation , the lack of a corresponding change in the x - ray slope rules out a jet - break interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , grb jet breaks have been inferred from optical data in the absence of simultaneous x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest therefore that current estimates of the jet opening angle distribution might be biased by events like grb  060206 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the grb explosion energy distribution and event rates may have to be revised . </S>"
