    "the formulation of a theory of star formation is a formidable task .",
    "it requires understanding of the nonlinear interactions among self - gravity , magnetic fields , rotation , chemistry ( including grain effects ) , turbulence , and radiation .",
    "stars form in fragments within interstellar molecular clouds , which have sizes ranging from 1 to 5 pc , masses from a few tens to @xmath3 m@xmath4 , mean densities @xmath5 @xmath1 , and temperatures @xmath6 k @xcite .",
    "their spectral lines have doppler - broadened linewidths that suggest supersonic ( but subalfvnic ) internal motions . in the deep interiors of such clouds , high - energy cosmic rays ( @xmath7 mev ) maintain a degree of ionization @xmath8 , whereas ultraviolet ( uv ) ionization is responsible for a much greater degree of ionization @xmath9 in the outer envelopes .",
    "the possible importance of magnetic fields to the support of interstellar clouds and to the regulation of star formation was first studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using the virial theorem .",
    "similar investigations by @xcite and @xcite followed .",
    "@xcite calculated the magnetic forces on a spherically - symmetric , gravitationally - bound cloud .",
    "self - consistent calculations by @xcite produced exact equilibria of initially uniform , isothermal , magnetic clouds embedded in a hot and tenuous , electrically - conducting external medium .",
    "@xcite used these equilibrium states to find the critical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath10 that must be exceeded for collapse against the magnetic forces to set in . @xcite",
    "performed numerical simulations of the collapse of a supercritical ( as a whole ) magnetic cloud .",
    "a picture of molecular clouds emerged in which magnetic fields play a central role in their support and evolution @xcite . to this date",
    ", magnetic braking remains the only mechanism that has been shown quantitatively to resolve the most significant dynamical problem of star formation , namely , the angular momentum problem ( mouschovias & paleologou 1979 , 1980 ; see also summary below ) .",
    "subsequent observations lent credence to this picture by revealing the importance of magnetic fields through both dust polarization measurements and zeeman observations .",
    "polarization studies have exhibited large - scale ordered magnetic fields connecting protostellar cores to their surrounding envelopes @xcite , often with an hourglass morphology @xcite , as predicted by the theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "a large body of zeeman observations @xcite revealed magnetic fields in the range @xmath11 g in molecular clouds , from small isolated ones to massive star - forming ones .",
    "these values are more than sufficient to establish the importance of magnetic fields in molecular cloud dynamics .",
    "it was recognized early on ( e.g. , see babcock & cowling 1953 , p. 373 ) that the magnetic flux of an interstellar blob of mass comparable to a stellar mass is typically several orders of magnitude greater than that of magnetic young stars .",
    "this is the so - called  magnetic flux problem \" of star formation .",
    "it lies in the fact that substantial flux loss must take place at some stage during star formation .",
    "ambipolar diffusion ( the relative motion between plasma and neutrals ) was first proposed by @xcite as a means by which an interstellar cloud as a whole would reduce its magnetic flux and thereby collapse .",
    "@xcite undertook a detailed calculation of the collapse of such ( spherical ) cloud .",
    "@xcite calculated the ambipolar - diffusion timescale by assuming that the magnetic force on the ions is balanced by the ( self-)gravitational force on the neutrals .",
    "@xcite followed the quasistatic contraction of a cloud due to ambipolar diffusion using a sequence of mouschovias ( 1976b ) equilibrium states , each one of which had a smaller magnetic flux than the previous one .",
    "a new solution for ambipolar diffusion by @xcite showed that the essence of this process is a redistribution of mass in the central flux tubes of a molecular cloud , rather than a loss of magnetic flux by the cloud as a whole .",
    "he found the ambipolar - diffusion timescale to be typically three orders of magnitude smaller in the interior of a cloud than in the outermost envelope , where there is a much better coupling between neutral particles and the magnetic field because of the much greater degree of ionization .",
    "this suggested naturally a self - initiated fragmentation of ( or core formation in ) molecular clouds on the ambipolar - diffusion timescale @xmath12 ( mouschovias 1979 , eq . [ 37 ] ) .",
    "the inefficiency of star formation was thereby attributed to the self - initiated formation and contraction of molecular cloud fragments ( or cores ) due to ambipolar diffusion in otherwise magnetically supported clouds @xcite .",
    "the _ central _ mass - to - flux ratio eventually exceeds its critical value for collapse , @xmath13 ( see mouschovias 1976a , eq . [ 44 ] ) , and dynamic contraction ensues .",
    "detailed numerical calculations in slab @xcite , cylindrical @xcite , and axisymmetric geometries @xcite transformed this scenario of star formation into a theory with predictive power .      during the early , isothermal phase of star formation , a cloud ( or a fragment ) must also lose a large fraction of its angular momentum ( e.g. , see spitzer 1968 , p. 231 ) .",
    "observations show that molecular clouds and embedded fragments ( or cores ) rarely exhibit rotation significantly greater than that of the background medium @xcite . if angular momentum were conserved from the initial galactic rotation ( i.e. , starting from angular velocity @xmath14 s@xmath15 at the mean density of the interstellar medium @xmath16 @xmath1 ) , centrifugal forces would not allow even the formation of interstellar clouds ( mouschovias 1991 ,   2 ) .",
    "fragmentation does not alter this conclusion ( mouschovias 1977 ,   1 ) .",
    "this is referred to as the  angular momentum problem \" of star formation . as far as clouds and their cores are concerned , the angular momentum problem has been shown to be resolved by magnetic braking ( i.e. , the transport of angular momentum from a fragment to its surrounding medium through the propagation of torsional alfvn waves along magnetic field lines connecting the fragment to the cloud envelope ) analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite and @xcite . hence the centrifugal forces resulting from the cloud s or core s rotation have a negligible effect on the evolution of the contracting core , at least up to central densities of @xmath17 @xmath1 ( see the last paragraph of tassis & mouschovias 2007b ) .",
    "interstellar grains comprise about 1% of the mass in the interstellar medium @xcite . @xcite and @xcite suggested that charged grains may couple to the magnetic field and thereby play a role in ambipolar diffusion and star formation . @xcite and @xcite compared and ambipolar - diffusion timescale and the free - fall timescale and concluded that ambipolar diffusion occurs over too long a timescale ( roughly 10 times greater than free - fall ) to be a relevant process in star formation .",
    "refinements by the same authors @xcite led to similar conclusions . through detailed numerical simulations of core formation and evolution including the effects of ( negative and neutral ) dust grains , @xcite found that grains lengthen the timescale for the formation of a core because of grain - neutral collisions , but cautioned that the ambipolar - diffusion timescale should not be compared to the free - fall timescale in determining its relevance in magnetically - supported clouds , as originally pointed out by @xcite , because molecular clouds are not free - falling .",
    "velocities characteristic of such collapse have not been observed .",
    "@xcite extended these calculations by including uv ionization and a variety of atomic metal ions ( c@xmath18 , s@xmath18 , si@xmath18 , mg@xmath18 , na@xmath18 , fe@xmath18 ) .",
    "attention was also paid to the complementary effect of protostellar evolution on the microscopic physics and chemistry @xcite",
    ".      the extent to which turbulence ( or waves ) may or may not affect the evolution of a protostellar fragment has been a topic of debate for several decades , receiving increased attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "a consensus has yet to be reached concerning even what causes and maintains the observed broad linewidths long thought to be indicative of supersonic turbulence @xcite , although @xcite and @xcite showed quantitatively that observations contradict the key assumption of turbulence simulations , namely , that molecular clouds are magnetically supercritical by a factor @xmath19 . despite a lack of agreement on the origin of the linewidths , analytical @xcite and numerical calculations ( eng 2002 ; eng & mouschovias 2009 , in preparation ) have demonstrated that turbulence ( or waves ) plays an insignificant role in the star formation process once dynamical contraction of a fragment ( or core ) ensues .",
    "observations showing narrowing and eventual thermalization of linewidths in protostellar cores @xcite are in agreement with this conclusion and with an earlier version of it @xcite .      during the early phases of star formation",
    "the energy produced by compressional heating is radiated away by the dust grains in the infrared . at higher densities",
    "( @xmath20 @xmath1 ) , the core traps and retains part of this heat and its temperature begins to rise .",
    "the evolution of the temperature in this nonisothermal regime may be approximated ( but substantially overestimated ) by using an adiabatic equation of state @xcite .",
    "more realistic equations of state have also been employed by , for example , @xcite . to accurately model the nonisothermal phase of protostellar contraction , however , one needs to include a proper treatment of radiative transfer .",
    "early efforts to include radiative transfer in ( nonmagnetic ) star formation calculations were confined to the use of the diffusion approximation @xcite .",
    "while the diffusion approximation is strictly applicable only to optically thick regions , its ease of implementation and relatively low computational cost make it an attractive choice .",
    "the eddington approximation offers a slight improvement in that it retains some of the rigor of using moments of the radiative transfer equation , while making the simplifying assumption that the radiation field is everywhere isotropic .",
    "its use in numerical calculations of ( nonmagnetic ) star formation has been documented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . by implicitly assuming that photons always travel a distance comparable to their mean - free path (",
    "even if this distance exceeds the free - flight distance @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the computational timestep ) , the eddington approximation gives unphysical behavior in optically thin regions , in which the mean - free - path is huge .",
    "the result is a signal speed unbound by the speed of light , i.e. , it violates causality ( e.g. , see ",
    "97 of mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) .",
    "increasing the accuracy and realism of a radiative transfer algorithm often requires making limiting assumptions about the hydrodynamics in order to make the problem tractable ( e.g. , yorke 1980 ; masunaga et al .",
    "1998 ) . a full frequency- and angle - dependent treatment of the radiation",
    "is nearly always confined to postprocessing the results of a hydrodynamic calculation @xcite or a grey ( i.e. , independent of frequency ) radiation hydrodynamic calculation @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation @xcite is a propitious compromise that retains some of the advantages of the diffusion and eddington approximations , while preserving causality and coupling self - consistently to the hydrodynamic equations .      in this paper",
    "we formulate the problem of the formation and evolution of protostellar fragments ( or cores ) in magnetically - supported , self - gravitating molecular clouds , including the effects of both ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation ( which becomes important at high densities ) , grain chemistry and dynamics , and radiation . using the results of eng ( 2002 ) and",
    "eng & mouschovias ( 2009 , in preparation ) , and @xcite , we may safely ignore the effects of turbulence and rotation , respectively , on the evolution of the protostellar core for the densities considered here .",

    "once dynamical contraction ensues , it was found that uv radiation has little effect on the evolution of central quantities and therefore it is usually neglected . for numerical reasons , however , we add to the electron and ion number densities the second term in equation ( 4h ) of @xcite ( @xmath162 @xmath1 ) so as to maintain a relatively large degree of ionization ( @xmath163 ) ( and therefore negligible ambipolar diffusion ) in the low - density ( @xmath164 @xmath1 ) cloud envelope .",

    "although @xmath170al is four orders of magnitude more potent an ionizer than @xmath169k , its short half - life ( 0.716 myr ) makes it relevant only if the initial mass - to - flux ratio of the parent cloud is close to critical , so that the evolution is rapid enough to retain an adequate amount of this radionuclide .",
    "@xmath170al can also become important if the core happens to get enriched because of a nearby supernova explosion .    finally , at temperatures on the order of 1000 k or higher , collisions between molecules are energetic enough to ionize those atoms with low ionization potentials , of which potassium and sodium are the most abundant .",
    "the abundance of sodium in the interstellar medium is greater than that of potassium ( by a factor @xmath175 ; lequeux 1975 ) , but the lower threshold of potassium ( 4.34 ev vs. 5.13 ev for sodium ) makes it the dominant ion .",
    "the ionization occurs at a rate @xcite given by @xmath176 because this process relies on collisions between two species , it is not expressed in terms of a quantity @xmath177 .      since the dust opacity , the conductivity of the gas , and the collision rates ( see below ) all depend on the ( local ) grain surface area",

    "this is our first main result : it gives the velocity of each charged species in terms of the electric field in the frame of the neutrals .",
    "another way of interpreting this equation is obtained by defining the velocity of the magnetic field lines with respect to the lab frame : @xmath407 then equation ( [ eqn : ohmeqn ] ) provides the velocities of all the charged species in terms of the neutral velocity and the field - line velocity .",
    "we made use of this concept earlier in section [ subsection : attachment ] .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : ohmeqn ] ) can be separated into components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",

    "en route to the derivation of a generalized ohm s law , the differential velocity of every species can be obtained in terms of the current density : @xmath434 using equation ( [ eqn : vf ] ) , is is straightforward to show that @xmath435 we may then write the components of the current density in terms of the differential velocity of the field lines as @xmath436 defining the indirect coupling coefficient @xmath288 implicitly by @xmath437\\,,\\ ] ] and introducing @xmath438\\,,\\ ] ] equation ( [ eqn : velocitiesj ] ) may now be written in component form as @xmath439 or , more explicitly ,    @xmath440    these equations were discussed in section [ subsection : attachment ] .",

    ", we may neglect the influence of inelastic collisions on the electron and ion fluids . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we also may assume that the velocity difference between a given grain and a neutral particle is less than the sound speed of the gas .",
    "these are both excellent assumptions , and lead to a much more compact form of the following definitions than would otherwise be possible .",
    "the variable @xmath277 first appeared in the definition of the parallel conductivity ( [ eqn : jparl ] ) and again later in the definition of the perpendicular conductivity ( [ eqn : jperp ] ) . for electrons and ions , @xmath444 , because of the negligible influence of inelastic collisions on the electron and ion fluids relative to that of elastic collisions .",
