    "gev the phase transition is of first order @xcite .",
    "as the higgs - mass is increased further , the thermodynamic singularity at the electroweak phase transition weakens .",
    "it is even possible , that for large values of the higgs - mass the phase transition loses its nonanalytical structure and is described by a crossover @xcite . in the strict sense the electroweak phase transition would then cease to exist .",
    "the exact determination of the critical higgs - mass value @xmath4 , at which the first order electroweak phase transition changes from first order to a crossover is important in view of its implications for the standard model .",
    "another aspect of the electroweak theory is the non - vanishing magnetic screening mass .",
    "it controls the infrared behavior of the theory at high temperatures and influences the nature of the phase transition itself .",
    "this work is a continuation of earlier studies and for details on the formulation of the theory we refer to @xcite .",

    "to illustrate the critical behavior as a function of @xmath14 , or the higgs - mass , we display in figure [ cv_max ] the maxima of the @xmath17-susceptibility , which is given by @xmath18    3.0 in -0.5 in cv_max cv_max.eps maxima of the @xmath17-susceptibility .",
