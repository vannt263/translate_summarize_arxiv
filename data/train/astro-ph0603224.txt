    "the young planetary nebula ( pn ) hubble 12 ( hb 12 ; pn g111.8 - 02.8 ) plays an important role in the study of pne .",
    "the line ratios of its strong fluorescent molecular hydrogen emission ( dinerstein et al . ,",
    "1988 ) match closely pure fluorescent emission ( black and van dishoeck , 1987 ) , which might have originated from shock excitation via collisional interaction of a strong wind from the central star against a circumstellar gaseous disk ( kastner et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "particular interest also comes from its bipolar structure of hb 12 .",
    "early radio continuum observations from vla ( bignell , 1983 ) first disclosed its bipolar configuration .",
    "miranda and solf ( 1989 ) later confirmed the double lobe structure along the north - south axis through long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , hora & latter ( 1996 ) and welch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed the existence of a ring - like structure near the central core from near - infrared and [ ] imaging .",
    "recent hst / nicmos observations have revealed clearly detailed structure of the inner torus and its bipolar lobes ( hora et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the origin of the axis - symmetric morphology of young pne has long been an unresolved issue . in classification of pne based on their morphology , zuckerman and aller ( 1986 ) and soker ( 1997 ) found that a large majority of pne have non - spherical shapes , some indicate extreme bipolar or axis - symmetric appearance .",
    "such structures could be generated by strong bipolar outflows during the late agb or post - agb phase and may be a transient phenomineon ( kwok et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the bipolar flows in turn could be produced by close binaries ( morris , 1990 ; soker et al . , 1998 ; soker , 2000 ) or rather focusing effects from the associated magnetic field ( garcia - segura et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) among various potential mechanisms suggested .",
    "note that observational evidence has been found in support of the binary model ( de marco et al .",
    ", 2004 ; hillwig , 2004 ; sorensen and pollacco , 2004 ) .",
    "detailed investigations of the physical nature and dynamical properties of the central source is therefore of fundamental importance to our understanding of the origin and evolution of pne .",
    "we have initiated a program combining efforts from the photometric measurements obtained by the one - meter telescope ( lot ) on the lulin observatory at central taiwan and the spectrographic observations carried out with the 2.16 m telescope at the xing - long station of the national astronomical observatory of the chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "our main objective is to search for the possible presence of periodic variations in the lightcurves of the nucleus of hb 12 , nsv 26083 .",
    "properties of the binary components could also be inferred from perhaps spectral observations of the central source .",
    "we describe , in section 2 , the observations and data reduction .",
    "the photometric lightcurves are presented in section 3 , and then a discussion of the results and interpretations in section 4 .",
    "the spectral features possibly originating from the cool secondary are investigated in section 5 , which is followed by a summary of the main results of this study .",
    "high - speed broadband photometric observations were performed in the queue mode on the nights of december 3 - 5 , 2003 using johnson r and i band filters with the lot telescope of the national central university at taiwan .",
    "the camera was operated with a princeton instruments 1340 @xmath3 1300 pixel ccd , giving a field of view of 11@xmath4 .",
    "the ccd has a readout noise of 15.7e and a gain of 4.4 .",
    "the setup results in a pixel scale of 0.62@xmath5 pixel@xmath6 .",
    "flat field exposures were obtained on the twilight sky .",
    "the seeing condition all through this run of observations varied between 1.3@xmath5 and 1.9@xmath5 .",
    "the journal of observations is summarized in table 1 .",
    "more than 800 snap shots of hb 12 were made , with each snap shot containing a 10s exposure in r and another 5s in i. the data reduction includes bias and dark current correction and flat - fielding based on standard packages and procedures in the noao iraf ( v2.12 ) .",
    "differential magnitudes of the central core of hb 12 were measured using the daophot package with three stars in the same field as reference stars .",
    "the s / n ratios of all stars are @xmath7 100 .",
    "no apparent variations were found with the reference stars .",
    "the differential magnitudes in the r & i bands have an accuracy within 0.04 mag and 0.02 mag , respectively .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopy was obtained by the 2.16 m telescope of naoc .",
    "the journal of observations in two separate sessions is given in table 2 .",
    "in the 2004 session , measurement was performed in the spectral range ( 4800 - 10500  ) on the night of aug .",
    "the spectral dispersion was 3.1   pixel@xmath6 .",
    "a beijing faint object spectrograph and camera ( bfosc ) and a thinned back - illuminated orbit 2048 @xmath3 2048 ccd were used .",
    "a slit width of 3.6@xmath5 was set .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 300 to 900 s. s / n ratios of the continuum of @xmath7 90 were achieved .",
    "exposures of fe - ne arcs were obtained right before and after each stellar spectrum and used for the wavelength calibration .    in the 2005 session ,",
    "spectroscopy was performed in the blue ( 3800 - 6200 ) spectral range on the night of sep .",
    "26 , 2005 .",
    "the 100   mm@xmath6 grating was used , which result in a two - pixel resolution of @xmath0 4.8  .",
    "the slit was placed at p.a .",
    "= 170@xmath8 , in parallel to the main axis of hb 12 as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the slit width was set to 2@xmath5 .",
    "an optomechanics research inc .",
    "spectrograph and a tektronix 1024 @xmath3 1024 ccd were used .",
    "the exposures ranged from 3600 to 7200 s , resulting in s / n ratios of @xmath7 60 .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed based on he - ar lamps exposed right before and after the target spectrum .",
    "the spectral data were reduced following standard procedures in the noao iraf ( v2.12 ) software package .",
    "the ccd reductions included bias and flat - field correction , successful background subtraction and cosmic - ray removal .",
    "flux calibration was derived with observations of at least two of the kpno standard stars per spectral range per night .",
    "the atmospheric extinction was corrected by the mean extinction coefficients measured for xing - long station , where the 2.16 m telescope is located .",
    "the multi - band photometric results of hb 12 were presented in figure 2 .",
    "the method of phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , stellingwerf , 1978 ) was used to analyze the lightcurves of nsv 26083 .",
    "the pdm code was employed to derive the period , maximum magnitude and amplitude of the light variation . before calculating the power spectra",
    ", we set the nightly mean magnitude to zero and calculated the amplitude spectra of these data .",
    "the i band data clearly covers three primary minima .",
    "a linear least square fit results in a period of p = 0.1415 @xmath9 0.0015 days .",
    "the r band lightcurve was fitted simultaneously using the period of the i band data because of its distinct existence of primary minima .",
    "the power spectra of the photometric data were presented in figure 3 .",
    "a prominent amplitude peak is found at 7.06 c / d , which is 3.4 hrs .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the profiles are sinusoidal for both the r and i bands .",
    "the period shows an amplitude of 0.06 @xmath9 0.0074 mag in r and 0.08 @xmath9 0.0046 mag in i. this suggests that nsv 26083 displays in its multi - band time - series observations periodic variation and indicates probably an eclipsing binary origin of hb 12 .",
    "it is the first time that a clear signature of periodicity is evidenced toward the exciting source of hb 12 , which may have important implications on the physical nature of bipolar structures associated with other young pne .",
    "note that the dip in the r band lightcurve seems to be shallower and smoother than that in the i band lightcurve .",
    "this wavelength dependence could probably be due to effects from h@xmath10 emission of the companion star , which is encompassed by the r band observations , or otherwise reflection effects from the illuminated surface of the less luminous star ( grauer & bond , 1983 ; bruch et al , 2001 ) .",
    "if we alternatively suppose the periodic variations of nsv 26083 are due to rotation modulation of stellar spot(s ) , the rotational period can be estimated as follows ( reid et al . , 1993 ) :    @xmath11    where p@xmath12 is the rotational period of the star in unit of hrs .",
    "r@xmath13 is the equatorial radius and m the mass of the star in solar units . following the discussion by reid et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , we use r@xmath13 = 1.5 r@xmath14 , where r@xmath14 is the radius of nsv 26083 .",
    "if zhang and kwok s ( 1993 ) result for t@xmath15 = 31800 k , @xmath16 g = 3.1 and m = 0.8 m@xmath1 are adopted , the rotational period p@xmath12 would be as large as 48 hrs .",
    "this is inconsistent with our estimation of 3.4 hrs as presented above and helps to exclude the possibility of the modulation by stellar spots .",
    "the mass of the central source of hb 12 has been determined to be 0.8 m@xmath1 by zhang and kwok ( 1993 ) based on existing infrared and radio data .",
    "we present below an estimation of the mass and radius of the proposed secondary component of the system .",
    "first , the secondary star with an orbital period of hours to days was suggested to have a mass of less than 0.5 m@xmath1 ( chen et al . , 1995 ) . if a mass ratio m@xmath17 / m@xmath18 @xmath19 0.8 ( m@xmath18 is the mass of the primary star ) is supposed , the upper limits of the mass and radius of the secondary would satisfy the following condition ( paczy@xmath20ski , 1981 ) :    @xmath21    where p is the orbital period in hrs .",
    "m@xmath17 and r@xmath17 are the mass and radius of the secondary in solar units , respectively .",
    "second , assume that the mass - radius relation of the lower main sequence stars can be applied to the secondary ( rappaport et al , 1982 ) :    @xmath22    we can combine eq .",
    "( 2 ) with eq . ( 3 ) to obtain    @xmath23    there is a general agreement ( sch@xmath24nberner , 1981 ; heap & augensen , 1987 ; weidemann , 1989 ; tylenda et al . , 1991b ; zhang & kwok , 1993 ; stasi@xmath20ska et al . ,",
    "1997 ) that the dispersion of the central stellar masses of planetary nebulae , averaged to around 0.6 m@xmath1 , should be rather small . if we assume a mass 0.6 m@xmath1 of the primary star , for m@xmath18 = 0.6 and 0.08 @xmath19 m@xmath17 @xmath19 0.443 , the separation of the stars a = 1.163 @xmath9 0.063 r@xmath1 . in turn",
    ", the radius of the roche lobe of the secondary is @xmath25@xmath17 = a [ 0.5 + 0.227 @xmath16 ( m@xmath17 / m@xmath18 ) ] .",
    "this results in an estimation of 0.547 @xmath9 0.03 r@xmath1 and the hemisphere of the secondary must be illuminated and heated by the primary source .",
    "the distance to hb 12 has been estimated to be 2.24 kpc by cahn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) based on existing optical and radio data , hora and latter ( 1996 ) determined a e(@xmath26 ) value is 0.28 measuring from the brackett line flux of the near - ir spectrum , the v magnitude determined by tylenda et al .",
    "( 1991a ) for the cool stellar component of hb 12 is 13.6 .",
    "if these results are adopted , the absolute visual magnitude m@xmath27 of the central star of hb 12 will be 0.98 .",
    "suppose that the primary component has a mass of 0.6 m@xmath1 and m@xmath27 = 0.98 at an effective temperature of 31800 k ( zhang and kwok , 1993 ) , the corresponding radius of the primary is estimated to be r@xmath18 = 0.19 r@xmath1 .",
    "in order to examine the nature of the putative binary companion of nsv 26083 , we have initiated a project of spectrographic measurements at the national astronomical observatory of the chinese academy of sciences using the 2.16 m telescope .",
    "figure 5 shows the low - resolution spectrum of nsv 26083 taken on august 8 , 2004 , which apparently indicates various emission lines characteristic of photoionized medium .",
    "the profiles of h@xmath10 and h@xmath28 are broader than other emission lines , which is here attributed to most likely effects of the rayleigh - raman scatting ( arrieta @xmath29 torres - peimbert , 2003 ) .    to search for further evidence on the possible binary origin of the nucleus of hb 12 ,",
    "we examine closely the spectra taken on september 26 , 2005 photospheric absorption features characteristic of a cool companion . the spectrum between 4150 and 4550 ",
    "is shown in figure 6a in an expanded scale .",
    "apparent g - band feature characteristic of late type stars is seen , and the molecular cn @xmath304216 absorption can also be identified . furthermore , absorption features due to the s - process elements such as y and sr were found in the spectrum with @xmath304178 and @xmath304607 being the primary features .",
    "the molecular c@xmath31c@xmath31 @xmath304752 is also seen in absorption in the spectrum as shown in figure 6b .",
    "the spectrum ranges from 5150 to 5600   clearly indicates c@xmath17 features at @xmath305165 and @xmath305585 and is presented in figure 6c .",
    "the triplet ( @xmath30@xmath305167 - 72 - 83 ) is also marginally seen in the spectrum .",
    "the above mentioned features seems to suggest the existence of a cool companion with a spectral type of g to early k to the exciting source of hb 12 .",
    "however , this introduces discrepancy with our mass estimation based on the lightcurves , which gives a spectral type of m. note that a m dwarf in isolation can not be detected at all at the distance of hb 12 of about 2.24 kpc ( cahn et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can not be reconciled unless additional physical processes are involved .",
    "the spectral change of the cool secondary is here attributed to most likely external heating of its upper atmosphere by the hot primary ( grauer and bond , 1983 ) . further investigations of this system based on high resolution spectroscopic observations is highly needed to have this issued resolved , which may come up with a more reliable determination of the spectral type of the secondary . however , this uncertainty with the spectral determination does not affect in any way our inference of the binary origin of the nucleus of hb 12 based on our photometric results .",
    "based on the time - series multi - band photometric observations and low - resolution spectroscopy , our study of the physical nature of the nucleus ( nsv 26083 ) of the young pn hb 12 has led to the following results :    \\1 . the central star is probably a close binary with an orbital period of 3.4 hrs .",
    "this provides further support to the theory of a binary origin of bipolar pne .",
    "the difference in the r and i lightcurves is indicative of a reflection effect of the illuminated surface of the secondary .",
    "+ 3 . assuming a mass of 0.6 m@xmath1 of the primary , an upper limit mass and radius of the secondary star can be estimated to be m@xmath17 @xmath19 0.443 m@xmath1 and r@xmath17 @xmath19 0.403 r@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this results in an estimation of a physical separation of @xmath0 1.163 r@xmath1 of the close binary in association with nsv 26083 .",
    "the hemisphere of the secondary can be suffering from reflection and heating effects from the hot primary .",
    "this thermal coupling may well lead to a spectral change of the secondary and deserve to be investigated further in detail . +",
