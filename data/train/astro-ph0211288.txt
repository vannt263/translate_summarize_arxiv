    "the very strong selection effects against finding low surface - brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) and dwarfs in the optical make it imperative to carry out blind searches at 21-cm where redshift can discriminate between extragalactic and foreground hydrogen .",
    "however , low surface - density and low surface - brightness systems might be expected to have low hi column - densities ( @xmath4 ) which can only be reached by long integrations ( disney & banks 1997 )  irrespective of telescope size .",
    "for instance , to reach @xmath5  @xmath1 when the gas is spread over 200 kms@xmath6 , even for a source which fills the beam , requires integrations of @xmath7  s or more .",
    "such deep searches have never been possible before but we have taken advantage of the multibeam system at parkes to integrate for 9000  s per point over a 32 square degree patch of sky , for 24 square degrees of which we have equivalently deep optical observations ( reaching 26.5  rmagsarcsec@xmath8 ) . this hideep survey ( minchin 2001 , minchin et al .",
    "2002 ) fails to turn up any intergalactic clouds , or indeed any gas with a mean inferred column density less than @xmath0  @xmath1 , when the survey was capable of reaching down to @xmath9  @xmath1 for galaxies with @xmath10  kms@xmath6 .",
    "since we have not imaged most of our sources in hi we can only calculate , following earlier authors , the inferred column - density , @xmath11 by combining the measured hi mass , @xmath12 , with an estimate of the hydrogen radius , @xmath13 , based on the measured optical radius @xmath14 , where we have assumed @xmath15 with @xmath16 , taken from the earlier work of authors such as salpeter & hoffman ( 1996 ) .",
    "= .45    figure 1 shows the results for the 96 sources with uniquely - identified optical counterparts which lie in the overlap area between the hi and optical surveys .",
    "figure 1b in particular is dramatic . allowing for observational errors it says , in essence , that all galaxies have",
    "exactly the same inferred hi column - density , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "a similar kind of result was reported by giovanelli & haynes ( 1984 ) for optically selected galaxies .",
    "this result could not be a selection effect because : ( a ) this is a blind survey ( i.e. no selection of targets ) and ( b ) our sensitivity to low column - density gas can be worked out retrospectively using the flux of the weakest sources actually detected from @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the integrated hi flux in jykms@xmath6 , @xmath20 is the velocity width in kms@xmath6 and @xmath21 is the beam fwhm in arcminutes .",
    "this gives a limit for hideep of @xmath22  @xmath1 at a velocity width of 100  kms@xmath6 showing that we should have easily detected low @xmath4 systems .",
    "if one integrates the equation of radiative transfer for 21-cm radiation passing thorugh a uniform slab , then ( e.g. kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a measure of the surface - brightness of the object in the line , @xmath25 is the excitation temperature , and @xmath26 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath27 . if @xmath28 the object is indistinguishable from the background .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate that @xmath29 where @xmath20 is the velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
    "clouds with @xmath30  kms@xmath6 have significant optical depth for @xmath31  @xmath1 .",
    "it is usually assumed ( field 1959 , kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) that , even where collisions are ineffective , the excitation ( spin ) temperature of hi gas is maintained at the kinetic temperature by ly-@xmath3 photons .",
    "this is so because neutral gas is so optically thick in the ly-@xmath3 line .",
    "however at low enough densities this mechanism can fail and the upper level will then be populated only by interaction with the cosmic radio background . in the optically thin limit equation ( 4 )",
    "can be substituted into ( 3 ) when @xmath32 so when @xmath33 , @xmath34 and such a slab or disc would become indistinguishable from the cbr .",
    "watson and deguchi ( 1984 ) have calculated numerically the escape of ly-@xmath3 photons generated in the gas by the x - ray background .",
    "they find that if @xmath35 then @xmath36 in equation ( 5 ) rapidly drops below 0.5 and the gas become unexcited .",
    "we refer to a disc of such unexcited gas as a `` frozen disc '' . such frozen discs , if they exist , could be entirely invisible in hi emission against the cmb , yet absorb light from background objects such as qsos .",
    "conversely , gas slabs could be ionised by the intergalactic radiation field unless , in maloney s ( 1993 ) notation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 describes the ionising field in units of photons@xmath1s@xmath6 , @xmath39 is the re - combination coefficient and @xmath40 is the total mass density in the disc  which sets the scale - height of the gas . for @xmath41 ( proximity effect , e.g. scott et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath42  g@xmath1 ( milky way ) and @xmath43  kms@xmath6 , the column - density limit for stability against ionisation is @xmath44  @xmath1 , an order of magnitude below our observations .",
    ".distribution of @xmath45 ( in k ) for hideep sources [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     note that all the above phenomena depend on @xmath4 and @xmath20 in the combination @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , if we combine equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in the optically thin limit we get @xmath47 which suggests we introduce a new quantity @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( `` thigh '' ) is the surface - brightness , or brightness temperature , of the neutral hydrogen at velocity @xmath50 .      1 .   to be optically thick at 21-cm @xmath51 2 .   for global star formation ( i.e. gas - disc instability ) ( toomre 1964 ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 = local gas vorticity",
    "3 .   for discs to be frozen ( watson & deguchi 1984 ) @xmath54 4 .   for discs to be ionised ( maloney 1993 ) @xmath55        1 .   there is a significant lack of sources below 6  k. that this cuts in at 7  k , rather than 2  k , suggests that some discs may be frozen while others are ionised .",
    "the deficit of sources above 60  k suggests that optical depth effects may be important .",
    "we go into this elsewhere ( lang et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "figure 2 is a suggestive sketch of the 21-cm universe in terms of @xmath45 . at",
    "the high @xmath45 end unstable discs underwent global star - formation , leaving behind high sb galaxies today with much lower @xmath45s .",
    "there may be some objects still undergoing global star - formation  they would be observed as high sb objects with strong fir outputs . at the low @xmath45 end would appear frozen discs and discs with their gas ionised  appearing perhaps as dwarf ellipticals in the optical .    at column - densities above @xmath56  @xmath1 molecular hydrogen may become self - shielding to uv radiation and most of the hydrogen will then be in this form .",
    "the hi observer would then see only a photo - dissociation region around molecular clouds with an hi column - density of @xmath57  @xmath1 ( allen 2001 ) .",
    "if the filling factor for such clouds was close to unity out to well beyond the optical diameter , then the inferred column - density , @xmath11 would be close to what we observe .",
    "of course large masses of hidden @xmath58 are implied , apparently sufficient to explain rotation curves .",
    "this fascinating and dramatic idea has been explored by allen ( 2001 ) and can not apparently be dismissed on observational grounds ( see coombes and pineau des forts ( 2000 ) for a recent comprehensive review ) ."
