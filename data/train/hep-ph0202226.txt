    "in this short note we shall describe a simple and tractable model for the pion light cone wave functions which is based on the instanton model of the qcd  vacuum .",
    "hadron light cone wave functions were theoretically introduced more than 20 years ago @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently the analysis of ref.@xcite based on the latest cleo measurements @xcite put some limits on the expansion coefficients of the axial - vector ( av ) pion wave function in terms of the gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "this analysis indicates that the pion wave function measured at @xmath3 gev@xmath4 is neither asymptotic @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 being the fraction of the pion momentum carried by the quark ) nor of the form proposed by chernyak and zhitnitsky in 1977 @xcite : @xmath7 .",
    "these two wave functions together with a typical prediction of the present model are shown in fig.1a . in fig .",
    "1b we show the 95% and 68% confidence level contour plots in the @xmath8 parameter space from the analysis of schmedding and yakovlev ( fig.6 in ref.@xcite ) together with the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and various parameters of the present model .",
    "the instantanton model , after integrating out gluons and performing the bosonization , reduces to a simple nambu - jona lasinio type model where the quarks interact _ nonlocally _ with an external meson field @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be expanded in terms of the pion fields : @xmath16 here @xmath17 mev and @xmath18 is a momentum dependent constituent quark mass which also plays a role of the pion - quark coupling .",
    "let us note that in the instanton model both quark and gluon condensation occur at the same scale @xmath19 which is associated with the average instanton size @xmath20  mev .    in principle",
    "@xmath21 has been calculated in the instanton model in the euclidean space time . here , following refs.@xcite",
    ", we will perform calculations directly in the minkowski space . to this end",
    "we shall choose a simple pole formula @xcite @xmath22 which for @xmath23 and for @xmath24 reproduces the @xmath25 dependence obtained from the instantons reasonably well @xcite ( see fig .",
    "2a ) . here",
    "@xmath26 is a model parameter which we choose to be of the order of @xmath27 mev .    ) of ref.[6 ] .",
    "black dots represent different model predictions , solid contour corresponds to 68% confidence level , whereas the dashed one to 95%,title=\"fig : \" ] ) of ref.[6 ] .",
    "black dots represent different model predictions , solid contour corresponds to 68% confidence level , whereas the dashed one to 95%,title=\"fig : \" ]    as we shall see , the model is technically very simple and allows to calculate pion wave functions ( not only the axial - vector , but also the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) and the pseudo - tensor ( pt ) ones ) analytically up to a numerical solution of a certain algebraical equation of the order @xmath28 . given this simplicity",
    "it is of importance to perform various tests in order to gain confidence in the model as well as to find its limitations . in this paper",
    "we provide 4 kinds of tests .",
    "first we calculate the leading twist pion wave function and compare with the existing data .",
    "next we calculate the non - leading twist wave functions , which are normalized to the quark condensate .",
    "this allows us to calculate @xmath29 .",
    "it is important to note that in our approach we calculate not only the @xmath6 dependence but also the dependence on the transverse momentum @xmath30 : @xmath31 by calculating @xmath2 moments we get the mixed condensate of dimension 5 .",
    "another advantage of our method is that the analytical expression for the quark condensate is given in terms of a minkowskian integral which in a limit of a constant @xmath32 and @xmath33 reduces to the well known euclidean form . by comparing the two expressions one can by inspection",
    "guess a continuation prescription which allows to rewrite certain euclidean integrals as the minkowskian ones .",
    "we use this in some respect _ ad hoc _ prescription to calculate the gluon condensate @xmath34 , which provides another test of our approach .",
    "we shall be dealing with the leading twist axial - vector ( av ) , twist 3 pseudo - scalar ( ps ) and pseudo - tensor ( pt ) wave functions defined as follows @xcite : @xmath35 where we have chosen @xmath36 as a light - cone vector parallel to @xmath37 and @xmath38 parallel to @xmath39 .",
    "all three wave functions are normalized to 1 .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath40 and yield @xmath41 therefore the expression for @xmath42 , whereas normalization of @xmath43 is used to fix the model parameter @xmath44 for given @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    technically speaking all three wave functions ( [ phidefs ] )",
    "are given in terms of a loop integral with a momentum dependent quark mass @xmath32 , which also acts as a quark - pion coupling . in order to calculate the loop integral we have to find zeros of the propagators which are",
    "generically of the form @xmath47 ^{4n}+i\\epsilon = 0 .",
    "\\label{prpopzero}\\ ] ] equation ( [ prpopzero ] ) can be conveniently rewritten as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the light cone",
    "parametrization @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath53 is fixed , equation ( [ prpopzero ] ) should be understood as an equation for @xmath54 .",
    "generally , equation ( [ zeq ] ) has @xmath28 complex solutions which in the following will be denoted as @xmath55 .",
    "these solutions depend on the specific value of @xmath56 and have to be calculated numerically .",
    "here one faces immediately the problem how to choose the integration contour in the complex @xmath54 plane .",
    "the prescription is very simple and has been at length discussed in ref.@xcite . as a result",
    "the @xmath57 integrals yield real wave functions which vanish for @xmath6 outside the region @xmath58 .",
    "moreover for @xmath59 , i.e. for a constant @xmath60 , this prescription reduces in a continuous way to the standard one of feynman .    with this prescription",
    "the calculations are rather straightforward and we obtain : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 ) .",
    "factors @xmath65 obey the following properties : @xmath66 which are crucial for the convergence of the @xmath67 integrals .",
    "it is now straightforward to perform either the @xmath67 integration in order to get @xmath68 , or the @xmath69 integration to get the @xmath30 -dependent functions @xmath70 .",

    "the cutoff parameter @xmath44 was adjusted by imposing the normalization condition on @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , as discussed in ref.@xcite , the leading twist pion wave function @xmath76 does not change any more if we increase @xmath46 above @xmath77 . on the other hand for @xmath78 the cutoff function ( [ cutform ] ) ,",
    "if continued to the euclidean metric , starts to deviate significantly from the one obtained in the instanton model .",
    "therefore we have chosen to work with @xmath79 . in figs .",
    "2b and 3 we have plotted @xmath75 , @xmath41 and @xmath80 for @xmath72 mev and @xmath81 .",

    "the axial - vector wave function , @xmath82 , vanishes at the end points as @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) and shows a plateau around @xmath85 with a small dip for @xmath86 .",
    "it differs from the asymptotic wave function @xmath11 and , as seen from fig .",
    "1b , the best agreement with the recent analysis of the cleo data is obtained for @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 or @xmath72 mev and @xmath89 .",
    "the fact that the true pion distribution amplitude may be broader than the asymptotic one has been already pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "such a behavior was found then in ref.@xcite where not only the nonlocality ( within the sum rules approach ) but also the radiative corrections have been taken into account .",
    "the pseudo - scalar pion wave function , @xmath41 , was calculated within the qcd sum rules in refs.@xcite .",
    "it had a @xmath90 shape and did not vanish at the end points .",
    "in our case @xmath41 vanishes at the end points for @xmath91 . indeed @xmath92",
    "\\label{endp}\\ ] ] ( and similarly for @xmath93 ) which is equal to 0 due to the property ( [ fprop ] ) except for @xmath71 where @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly , the vanishing of @xmath95 for @xmath96 is correlated with the nonconvexity of @xmath75 at the end points , which , as stated above , behaves like @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) for @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 ) . in any case",
    "@xmath41differs from its asymptotic form @xmath99 .",
    "both pseudo - scalar and pseudo - tensor wave functions show stronger @xmath46 dependence than @xmath75 . for @xmath71 @xmath80",
    "coincides with the asymptotic expression @xmath100 , while for @xmath86 its is depleted at the end points and peaked in the center .",
    "since the model parameters are fixed by the normalization of the axial - vector wave function we could use the normalization condition for @xmath95or @xmath80 to calculate the quark condensate .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "we see that the quark condensates obtained from the two normalization conditions do not coincide .",
    "in fact , for almost all model parameters considered , we find @xmath101{\\left\\langle \\bar{q}q\\right\\rangle _ { ps}/\\left\\langle \\bar{q}% q\\right\\rangle _ { pt}}\\simeq 0.9.\\ ] ] in absolute values the quark condensate calculated within our model overshoots the phenomenological value of @xmath0 mev@xmath102 .",
    "this is mostly due to the rather poor convergence of the @xmath103 integrals ( [ dkt ] ) . indeed for large @xmath104 : @xmath105 this is also the reason of rather strong @xmath46 dependence of @xmath106and @xmath80 .",
    "the euclidean formula for the gluon condensate in the instanton model of the qcd vacuum reads @xcite : @xmath107 apart from the numerical factor in front it differs from @xmath108 by an additional power of @xmath109 in the numerator .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have suggested the continuation prescription of ( [ ggcond ] ) to the minkowski metric with the result @xmath110 numerical result ( table 1 ) depends very weakly on @xmath46 and is compatible with the phenomenological value @xcite : @xmath111 .",
    ".condensates for @xmath72 mev [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1a ]    soft pion theorems provide link between dynamical objects like the light cone wave functions @xcite and static properties of the physical vacuum @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in refs.@xcite that moments of @xmath112 are given in terms of the mixed quark - gluon condensates @xmath113 here @xmath114 is a gluon field strength and @xmath115 , @xmath116 .    unfortunately the ratio @xmath117 which follow from ( [ kt2 ] ) is not reproduced within our approach due to the slow convergence of the @xmath103 integration in the case of @xmath118 . in order to estimate the value of the mixed condensate of dimension 5 , @xmath119 , we choose therefore the first equation of eqs.([kt2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for the parameters which are closest to the original instanton model , @xmath72 mev and @xmath89 , we get @xmath120 mev@xmath121 in perfect agreement with the direct calculation of @xmath122 in the instanton model @xcite which gives @xmath123 mev@xmath124 .",
    "the nonlocal njl model with the momentum dependent constituent quark mass has been applied to calculate pion light cone wave functions @xcite .",
    "it gives a satisfactory description of the leading twist @xmath125 wave function , whereas for the twist 3 wave functions we find a somewhat larger sensitivity to the model parameters .",
    "present prescription can be easily extended to describe kaon wave functions with an explicit symmetry breaking due to the non zero current strange quark mass .",
    "also two meson generalized parton distributions both for pions and kaons can be easily calculated . by crossing symmetry",
    "one can also apply our method to calculate the skewed distributions and structure functions @xcite .    on the theoretical side one",
    "has to investigate more closely the pcac relation within the present approach .",
    "it is known that the properly defined currents should include additional terms with respect to those considered here @xcite .",
    "although these new terms are not unique and suppressed by the instanton packing fraction , their influence on our results should be investigated .",
