    "globular cluster are often the only objects that can be detected in the halos of other galaxies .",
    "since most globular cluster are very old , studying them provides vital information about the formation and chemical history of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "the similar ages of the constituent stars and low velocity dispersion makes these objects relatively easy to study in integrated light .",
    "the most reliable way to obtain information about age and abundance patterns of a stellar population is star by star analysis via a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "however this technique is only feasible for nearby objects , due to the limits of current instrumentation .",
    "therefore , we need to develop reliable methods for analyzing the composite light from all the stars in these systems . this is no easy feat , since many factors can complicate the analysis .",
    "one of the biggest problems that plagues the study of the integrated light of a stellar population is the very similar effects that age and metallicity have on the spectra of stellar populations @xcite . however , the degeneracy between the age and metallicity can be broken .",
    "rabin ( 1980 , 1982 ) and @xcite noticed that the balmer lines are quite sensitive to age . combining this with the knowledge that metal lines , such as mg @xmath1 , [ mgfe ] , or @xmath2fe@xmath3 , are relatively more sensitive to metallicity than age @xcite , the degeneracy between age and metallicity can be broken by plotting the strength of the balmer lines versus metallic absorption blends .",
    "this is because h@xmath0 operates in such a way that its strength is nonlinear with temperature , especially between 6000 k and 9000 k , where main - sequence turnoff stars from a few hundred myr to ancient reside . but",
    "stars of other kinds also inhabit that temperature band .",
    "the h@xmath0-metal - index grids give the impression that age and metallicity are the only factors that affect a population s location in the grid , but of course this is misleading .",
    "as you can see from fig [ 1 ] ( a ) , other factors must be affecting the values of the indices , since they are quite scattered and some are off the grid . for comparison , an average of the virgo elliptical galactic nuclei is also plotted along with the globular cluster data ( j. serven et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "observational difficulties play a main role , of course .",
    "there are sometimes horizontal branch and blue straggler stars that can contribute enough to alter the lines strengths .",
    "rarer stars such as agb - manque stars @xcite and planetary nebula can be ruled out as being significant contributers under ordinary circumstances , as can the much fainter white dwarf population .",
    "these warm stars make the balmer indices stronger , not weaker , so for populations of these stars to represent a `` solution '' to the mystery , there would also need to be a systematic error in the models to weaken balmer index strength .",
    "additionally , there is the possibility that h@xmath0 is being filled in by nebular emission from hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "this fill - in could come from diffuse gas , but it could also come from flaring stars of various sorts : asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , m - type dwarfs , cataclysmic variables , and others are known to have transient emission - line spectra @xcite .    finally , there is the possibility that abundance - mixture effects could drive a significant change in h@xmath0 and other feature strengths .",
    "this is a relatively unexplored avenue of investigation , but the tools now exist to probe the question @xcite , and that is our primary task in this paper .",
    "the models and observational data are already available in the literature , but the implementation is recapped in @xmath4 .",
    "the implications of our investigation are discussed in @xmath5 , and then there is a brief conclusion .",
    "a version of integrated - light models @xcite that use a new grid of synthetic spectra in the optical @xcite in order to investigate the effects of changing the detailed elemental composition on an integrated spectrum was used to create synthetic spectra at a variety of ages and metallicities for single - burst stellar populations .",
    "the underlying isochrones for most of the present paper were the @xcite ones , because they allow us `` manual ''",
    "hb morphology control . however , there are certain caveats to using these isochrones .",
    "specifically the models are a bit crude by today s standards and the ages are about 2 gyr too old , so that 17 gyr should really be interpreted as 15 gyr .",
    "other isochrone sets were used to check the results .    for this exercise ,",
    "new stellar index fitting functions were generated .",
    "the data sources include a variant of the original lick collection of stellar spectra @xcite in which the wavelength scale of each observation has been refined via cross - correlation , as well as the miles spectral library @xcite with some zero point corrections , and the coude feed library ( cfl ) of @xcite .",
    "the cfl was used as the fiducial set , in the sense that any zero point shifts between libraries were corrected to agree with the cfl case .",
    "the miles and cfl spectra were smoothed to a common gaussian smoothing corresponding to 200 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the rectified - lick spectra were measured and then a linear transformation was applied to put it on the fiducial system .",
    "multivariate polynomial fitting was done in five overlapping temperature swaths as a function of @xmath7 , log @xmath8 , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the fits were combined into a lookup table for final use . as in @xcite ,",
    "an index was looked up for each `` star '' in the isochrone and decomposed into `` index '' and `` continuum '' fluxes , which added , then re - formed into an index representing the final , integrated value after the summation .",
    "this gives us empirical index values .",
    "after that , additive index deltas were applied as computed from the grid of new synthetic spectra when variations in chemical composition are needed .",
    "the grid of synthetic spectra is complete enough to predict nearly arbitrary composition changes .",
    "we also smoothed the @xcite globular cluster spectra to 200 km s@xmath6 or the lick @xcite resolution , as needed , and measured lick or lick - like pseudo - equivalent width indices @xcite from them .",
    "when the globular clusters and the age - metallicity model grid of values were plotted on the same graph ( see figures [ 1 ] ( b ) and [ 2 ] ) a globular cluster s position in the grid allows one to estimate its age and metallicity , at least naively .",
    "cursory examination of these graphs yields a puzzling thing . on graphs with h@xmath0 as one of the indices , some of the globular clusters lie much below the oldest age plotted of 17 gyr ( see figure [ 1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "however , graphs that are not plotted with the h@xmath0 index as one of the axes do not have this problem ( see figure [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that there could be something going on in the spectra of these globular clusters near the h@xmath0 line that does not affect h@xmath9 or h@xmath10 to the same degree .",
    "it could also indicate that the models for the h@xmath0 index are not correct .",
    "many factors could potentially affect the balmer features in the integrated light of the globular clusters .",
    "we consider effects due to abundance ratios , horizontal branch morphology , the presence of blue stragglers , and emission fill - in of the balmer lines due to hydrogen recombination lines from either external nebulae or stellar activity in individual cluster stars .",
    "we also consider the illusions due to miscalibrated models .",
    "it is of interest to examine the spectra themselves for evidence to support the various hypotheses that could explain their behavior .",
    "comparison of the spectra of the globular clusters with ages off the grid to the spectra of globular clusters with similar metallicity lying within the grid indicates that the main difference is the depth of the h@xmath0 line itself , rather than a difference in heights of either the blue or red continuum bands ( see figure [ 3 ] ) . specifically , the h@xmath0 line of the clusters off the grid are shallower than those that are on the grid , and , morphologically , this does not seem to be a problem in the continuum regions at all , but a true modulation of the h@xmath0 line itself .    figure [ 3 ] should be compared to figure [ 4 ] , which shows several model population spectra with [ x / r]=0.3 dex , where x stands for fe , mg , ti , or ni , and r stands for `` generic heavy element '' .",
    "other simple element variations from solar were explored , but these four had the largest impact on the spectrum shape .",
    "we note that none of the elements effect the model depth of the h@xmath0 line itself ; only modest affects in the continuum regions .",
    "visually , fe enhancement raises the average height of the red continuum band .",
    "quantitatively , however , this `` extra slope '' does little to change the actual index value .",
    "furthermore , in comparing model spectra with the observed globular cluster spectra , raising the red continuum flux does not improve the appearance of the spectral match .    a more quantitative way to analyze the effect",
    "due to element enhancement is by looking at the spectral response of the indices when the various elements are enhanced in the same way as @xcite .",
    "the results of these calculations on our model spectra can be found in table 1 .",
    "row 1 is the model index while row 2 is the uncertainty assuming a @xmath11 at @xmath12  .",
    "rows 3 through 25 list the change of index when the labeled element is enhanced by @xmath13 dex , while the last row has all elements up by @xmath13 dex .",
    "as one can see , most elements have little effect on the h@xmath0 index .",
    "two iron - peak elements , fe and ni , oppose each other in the sign of their effects , and two alpha elements , mg and ti , oppose each other in the sign of their effects .",
    "if the alpha elements and the iron peak elements internally rise or fall together , then h@xmath0 is basically completely clean from spectral effects from element enhancement .",
    "this is in broad agreement with observations made directly from the model spectra .",
    "parenthetically , table [ tab1 ] does not show similar cleanliness for any other index , with mg @xmath1 responding to mg , fe indices responding to fe , h@xmath10 responding to fe and si , and h@xmath9 responding to c , o , mg , si , cr , and fe !",
    "the lack of signal in the h@xmath0 index seems to indicate that the reason for larger spread in ages for grid with the h@xmath0 index as one of the axes is most likely not due to enhancement of one element or any group of elements that directly change the spectral shapes .",
    "there remains , perhaps , a possibility of elements that do not make direct spectral changes , but might affect the temperatures of the stars as a whole , such as o and the noble gases he and ne .",
    "an excess of o or a dearth of he would make the isochrones , at least , around the main sequence turnoff region of the h - r diagram , cooler . if metal rich globular clusters tend to have such a mixture , but elliptical galaxies do not , then it may work out as observed , but of course there is no reason to suspect a chemical bifurcation in the two classes of metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "horizontal branch morphology , that is `` red clump , '' `` extended , '' `` blue , '' or `` extreme , '' is easy to determine with a good color magnitude diagram of the stars within the globular cluster , but difficult to disentangle via integrated light measures because of significant degeneracy with both age and metallicity ( cf .",
    "fig 37 of @xcite ) .",
    "blue horizontal branch morphology can increase the h@xmath0 index by as much as 0.75   compared to clump @xcite .",
    "fig 1 ( a ) illustrates how different horizontal branch morphology can shift the model grids by showing two model grids with different hb morphologies .",
    "this shift gives the appearance that the globular clusters with blue horizontal branch morphologies are younger or more metal poor than they really are .",
    "@xcite proposed that the ratio of h@xmath14/h@xmath0 is more sensitive to horizontal branch morphology than to age allowing us to break the degeneracy present between these two parameters .",
    "graphs with h@xmath14/h@xmath0 versus iron indices have globular clusters with mostly blue horizontal branch morphologies that appear displaced relative to the locus occupied by the models , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 5 ] . since in the milky way globular cluster system , the horizontal branch morphology changes from blue to red at around [ fe / h ] = @xmath15",
    ", there is some ambiguity with metallicity .",
    "it is unlikely that a ratio of balmer indices will be completely optimal for detecting an extended horizontal branch .",
    "indeed , we know of no effort to optimize the integrated - light detection of horizontal branch types in the literature , so we provide a simple one in this work . the idea is to pick three indices , and force them to provide solutions for age , horizontal branch morphology , and metallicity ; three equations in three unknowns .",
    "the models used as a base are the @xcite models because the horizontal branch can be forced to be clump , extended , or blue at any metallicity .",
    "then an error assigned to each color , magnitude , or index yields a propagated error in age , morphology , or abundance .",
    "the corners used for the linearization are ages 11 and 17 gyr , [ fe / h ] of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and morphologies either red clump or blue , where clump was assigned a numerical value of zero , and blue a numerical value of one .",
    "the models also come in an `` extended '' horizontal branch morphology that stretches from the red clump to log @xmath18 , but in this paper we only use those models for plots .",
    "the `` blue '' morphology has stars between log @xmath19 and log @xmath20 .",
    "errors were assigned to each index , and then used to do error propagation in the linear solutions , giving a goodness - of - fit for age , morphology , and metallicity .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig [ 6 ] .",
    "for each trio of indices , the horizontal branch solution is on the y axis , and the metallicity solution is on the x axis .",
    "model sequences for ages 8 and 17 gyr are shown at 0.2-dex intervals from [ fe / h ] = @xmath212.0 to @xmath210.2 , and the collection of @xcite indices are shown , symbols varying between hbr @xmath22 and hbr @xmath23 , as in previous figures . in the figure",
    "the model sequences separate much more than the simpler balmer index ratio plot .",
    "however , we caution that the models used are rather out of date , and better solutions might be found from more up to date isochrones .    in terms of horizontal branch morphology being responsible for the too - low h@xmath0 strengths , this hypothesis seems doomed .",
    "the models that do not match already have the reddest possible horizontal branch morphology , and the models fit both blue and red horizontal branches for most clusters , just not the anomalous group of redder clusters .",
    "no provision for blue straggler stars are in the synthesis models .",
    "if such stars were present in the models , the balmer line strengths would strengthen by several tenths of ngstroms , in a sense to make the low - lying globular clusters lie even lower .      filling in of the absorption lines",
    "due emission could change the depth of the lines present in the spectra .",
    "this change in depth will lower the lick / ids index value of the object which is what we want .",
    "emission could be caused by many things , such as : gas clouds in the line of sight , planetary nebula , supernova remnants , m dwarfs with active chromospheres , and agb type stars .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we adopt a star formation region - like recombination spectrum for an optically thick nebula of @xmath24 k and @xmath24 electrons per cubic centimeter , @xcite gives the relative balmer line intensities of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for a given h@xmath0 index fill - in value , the equivalent widths of the h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 indices can be predicted after correcting for ( 1 ) underlying continuum shape and ( 2 ) the widths of the indices themselves . using values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the relative continuum flux ratios , a one - angstrom fill - in of h@xmath0 propagates to fill - ins for the higher - order indices of @xmath29  , @xmath30  , @xmath31  , and @xmath32  .",
    "planetary nebulae can be seen , one by one , in milky way globular clusters , and only m5 has a planetary nebula , so they should be rare in m31 globular clusters as well .",
    "supernova remnants are much more improbable .",
    "gas clouds containing neutral sodium are known to exist along most lines of sight out of the galaxy @xcite but there is no reason to expect ionized hydrogen to linger in the potential wells of globular clusters since the rms velocity for a 10,000 k proton is @xmath33 km s@xmath6 exceeds the escape velocity of all but the largest globular clusters .",
    "we thus discount these three explanations in general , keeping in mind that specific globular clusters can be affected this way .    however , the stellar sources are less easy to discount .",
    "we discuss active cool dwarfs and flaring giants together .",
    "m dwarfs are known to have active chromospheres , although old ones get less active @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite observed a probable bright , red giant flaring in their spectra .",
    "this star is bright enough so that , by itself , it will alter the integrated balmer line strengths .",
    "the character of these two sources is different , however , in that the numerous m dwarfs are spatially broad and should be nearly constant in balmer emission output while the giants are spatially discrete , and should be highly time - variable .",
    "m dwarf light will still give a net balmer emission signal because the m dwarfs are concentrated toward the center of the cluster , albeit less so than the more massive stars .",
    "in support of cool giants causing fill - in , the most metal - poor clusters do not have very cool giants .",
    "it is only at [ fe / h ] @xmath34 and above that clusters begin to have long period variables and genuine m - type giants , and these are the clusters that show the anomalously low h@xmath0 strengths .    under some extreme assumptions ,",
    "we use our models and the data of @xcite to estimate the contribution of the emission of active m dwarfs .",
    "the @xcite definition of h@xmath35 is output by our models .",
    "the @xcite definition is somewhat different , but of course quite similar . for cooler m dwarfs",
    ", the index itself goes negative ( emission - like ) due to tio absorption , and we were able to confidently trace the non - active envelope in the @xcite data , and then assign an apparent turn - on temperature of 3600 k , and a ballpark `` fully active '' @xmath36h@xmath37   of equivalent width .",
    "assuming that 100% of the stars cooler than 3600 k were fully active , we recalculated the models .",
    "we also assumed that the initial mass function was a power - law all the way to a cutoff of @xmath38 , which makes the coolest dwarfs more important in integrated light than direct counting suggests .",
    "the h@xmath35 and inferred h@xmath0 results are listed in table [ tab2 ] as a function of metallicity .",
    "the @xmath36h@xmath0 values in table [ tab2 ] , even inflated as they are , are still short of the approximately 0.5   needed to come close to solving our h@xmath0 dilemma , but the generic behavior is interesting , namely that metal - poor populations have so few stars that cool that the emission is completely negligible , but then the metal - rich populations , as judged by the last entry in the table , seem to saturate or plateau ( because more and more non - active but cool stars contribute to the flux ) .",
    "this leads to a sort of on or off state , with `` on '' happening for old populations more metal rich than about @xmath39 dex in [ z / h ] .",
    "this tends to lend support to the cool - giant hypothesis , since they would share a similar gross temperature behavior with metallicity as do the dwarfs , and the metal - poor clusters tend to lie on the old - age model grid .",
    "this does imply some things for elliptical galaxies , however , if it were true .",
    "the galaxies would have such large numbers of stars in a spectroscopic aperture that stochastic fluctuations in agb star activity would be minimal , so they would reach an average h@xmath35 and h@xmath0 value with minimal scatter .",
    "the metal - rich portions of their stellar populations would contribute a partially - infilled balmer index series , and so the larger the percentage of their population that is metal - rich , the younger they would appear in a balmer - metal diagram . while something like this trend is seen observationally @xcite one should not jump to conclusions since even the higher - order balmer features show a similar behavior .",
    "are the line depths of current sets of models too deep ?",
    "the worthey models agree quite well with more modern model sets , especially after rescaling the ages by subtracting 2 gyr .",
    "if , however , all authors are making the same mistake and all balmer line strengths should be dropped to a level to make the low - lying globular clusters fit along the old - age sequence , then there are some implications .",
    "first , even with correction for horizontal branch morphology , the metal - poor clusters will still look substantially younger .",
    "second , the average elliptical galaxy will look young enough to raise eyebrows .    despite this quandary",
    ", there may be one unlikely way to get the models to fit everything , or nearly everything , and that is to invoke hefty abundance ratio systematics , especially with oxygen and helium , that we could not test effectively in this paper .",
    "such a scheme would require that element ratios drift in opposite directions for metal - rich globular clusters versus elliptical galaxies .",
    "the effects of o and he abundance would have operate mostly on the isochrone temperatures and age scales , and not operate significantly on the integrated stellar spectra .",
    "however , in the absence of more direct observational evidence , this scheme is very speculative .",
    "extracting information from the integrated light of stellar populations is not an easy process , since there are many complex factors affecting the spectra .",
    "decoupling the age - metallicity degeneracy by graphing balmer line indices vs. metal feature indices has allowed us to learn much more about stellar populations , however the weakness of the observed h@xmath0 line relative to the models needs to be explained .",
    "this paper shows that altered abundance ratios , are unable to account for the observed weakness in the balmer line strengths of globular clusters",
    ".    of the other factors that can potentially affect the balmer line strengths , horizontal branch morphology effects are hard to disentangle since they are also degenerate with age and metallicity , but seem well understood . by marking the clusters that have extended or blue horizontal branches it becomes clear that horizontal branch morphology can not solve the h@xmath0 problem .",
    "likewise , inclusion of blue stragglers will not help , even if there was evidence for a strong modulation of blue straggler frequency with metallicity , which there is not @xcite .",
    "emission fill - in of the balmer lines due to hydrogen recombination lines from external nebulae is probably ruled out , except for case like the planetary nebula in m5 .",
    "stellar activity in individual cluster stars seems to be the only surviving mechanism that has good evidence .",
    "however , even being generous , the cool tail of m dwarfs do not appear to be able to generate enough flux to cause the modulation in h@xmath0 needed .",
    "the remaining stellar source is flaring in m giants .",
    "these stars are bright enough , and inherently stochastic in nature , which seems to fit the observations of clusters that scatter to low h@xmath0 rather randomly .",
    "finally , it remains a long - shot possibility that abundance ratios in o or the noble gases can cause isochrone temperature drifts severe enough to affect the h@xmath0 problem .",

    "<S> spectral feature index diagrams with integrated globular clusters and simple stellar population models often show that some clusters have weak h@xmath0 , so weak that even the oldest models can not match the observed feature depths . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we rule out the possibility that abundance mixture effects are responsible for the weak indices unless such changes operate to cool the entire isochrone . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this result in the context of other explanations , including horizontal branch morphology , blue straggler populations , and nebular or stellar emission fill - in , finding a preference for flaring in m giants as an explanation for the h@xmath0 anomaly . </S>"
