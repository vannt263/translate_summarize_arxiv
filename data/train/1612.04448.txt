    "we consider a tournament among players @xmath0 , in which each match involves two players . the tournament is assumed to be of knockout type in that the losers of matches are eliminated and do not move on to the next round , and the tournament continues until all but one player is eliminated , with that player being declared the winner of the tournament .",
    "the match format is specified by the set of positive integers @xmath9 with the interpretation that there are a total of @xmath10 rounds , with round @xmath2 consisting of @xmath11 matches , @xmath12 because @xmath13 players have been eliminated by the end of round @xmath14 , we must have that @xmath15    we suppose that the constitution of the matches in a round is totally random . that is , for instance ,",
    "the @xmath16 players that play in round @xmath5 are randomly chosen from all @xmath17 players and then randomly arranged into @xmath18 match pairs .",
    "the winners of these @xmath18 matches , along with the @xmath19 players that did not play a match in round @xmath5 then move to round @xmath20 , and so on .",
    "we suppose that the players have respective values @xmath1 , and that a match involving players @xmath2 and @xmath3 is won by player @xmath2 with probability @xmath21 we let @xmath22 be the probability that player @xmath2 wins the tournament , @xmath23 in section 3 we derive a lower bound on the probability that the strongest player ( e.g. , the one with the largest @xmath24 ) wins the tournament , and an upper bound on the probability that the weakest player wins the tournament . in section 4 we derive upper and lower bounds on the win probabilities @xmath25 and also show that if @xmath26 then @xmath27 in section 5 , we consider the special case where @xmath28 and show that when @xmath29 the best format for the strongest player is the so - called _ balanced format _ that has @xmath30 matches in the first round and then has all remaining players competing in each subsequent round .",
    "we also show that whenever the number of remaining players , say t , is even there is an optimal ( from the point of view of the best remaining player ) format that calls for @xmath31 matches in the next round .",
    "we also show , for the sections special case , that the worst format for the best player is to have exactly one match each round .",
    "analogous results for the worst player are also shown .",
    "although we do not have a proof we conjecture that , among all possible formats , the balanced format maximizes and the one match per round minimizes the best players probability of winning the tournament even in the case of general @xmath32 ( we show by a counterexample that the format that calls for @xmath31 matches when an even number @xmath33 of players remain is not optimal for the best player in the general case . )",
    "most papers in the literature on random knockout tournaments consider more structured formats than the ones we are considering which suppose that the number of matches in each round is fixed and that the game participants in each round are randomly chosen from those that remain . in these papers",
    "the structure of the tournament is fixed and players are randomly assigned to positions of the structure .",
    "for example , a structure with 6 players having a balanced format ( meaning 2 matches in round 1 , 2 matches in round 2 and 1 match in round 3 ) might in round 1 have a match between those in positions 1 and 2 and one between those in positions 3 and 4 , with the winners then playing each other in round 2 and 5 playing 6 in round 2 .",
    "another possibility would be to have the winners of round 1 each play in round 2 one of those that did not play in round 1 .",
    "figures [ fig_bal_str1 ] and [ fig_bal_str2 ] indicate these two structures .",
    ".5     .5     an example of a non - balanced structure with 6 players is one where there is a single match in each round , with the winner of a match playing in the following round someone who has not yet played .",
    "maurer @xcite proved for random structured formats , when @xmath34 , that the win probability of player @xmath5 is maximized under the balanced structures . because , as noted by maurer , a random format can be expressed as a mixture of random structured formats , this also establishes the result for random formats . in section 5",
    "we give another proof of this result , which is both quite elementary and also shows , under the same condition , that when there are @xmath35 remaining players the optimal random format can schedule either @xmath30 or @xmath36 games if @xmath17 is even , and @xmath30 games if @xmath17 is odd .",
    "we also prove , when @xmath34 , that the win probability of player @xmath5 is uniquely minimized by the random format that has exactly one match in each round .",
    "chung and hwang @xcite proved that for any structured format , if @xmath37 is decreasing in @xmath2 then so is the winning probability , which also proves the result for any random unstructured format . in corollary 1 of section 4",
    "we give a proof of this result that also proves , when @xmath37 is decreasing in @xmath38 that the probability player @xmath2 reaches round @xmath39 is decreasing in @xmath2 for all @xmath39 .",
    "there are other papers studying knockout tournaments , for example , david @xcite , glenn @xcite , hennessy and glickman @xcite , horen and riezman @xcite , hwang @xcite , marchand @xcite .",
    "the paper ross and ghamami @xcite discusses efficient ways of simulating win probabilities for such tournaments .",
    "in this section we establish a lower bound on the probability that the strongest player wins the tournament , and an upper bound on the probability that the weakest player wins .",
