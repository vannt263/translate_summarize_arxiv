    "optical solitons were first predicted by hasegawa and tappert @xcite and later observed by mollenauer _ et .",
    "the existence of soliton solutons in non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) is related to the complete integrability of this dynamical system @xcite .",
    "it was found that non - linear schrdinger equation aptly describes the pulse propagation in picosecond regime .",
    "generalization of the nlse is neccessitated to take into account higher order dispersion , self - steepening of the pulse due to the dependence of the slowly varying part of the non - linear polarization on time and the delayed effect of raman response for describing optical pulse propagation in the femtosecond domain @xcite .",
    "higher order nlse which captures these effects is given by @xcite , @xmath1 it has both group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) and third order dispersion term , respectively represented by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "parameter @xmath4 takes into account kerr non - linearity , whereas self steepening effect arising from time variation of the non - linearity @xmath5 has been incorporated through the coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "the terms with coefficient @xmath7 and @xmath8 account for the self frequency shift , originating from delayed raman response .",
    "this model , unlike nlse , is not integrable in general .",
    "a few integrable cases have been identified ; these are known as ( i ) sasa - satsuma case @xcite , ( ii ) hirota case @xcite and ( iii ) derivative nlse of type i and type ii @xcite .",
    "a few restrictive special solutions of bright and dark type have been obtained for this system @xcite .",
    "effects of these higher order terms on pulse propagation have been studied numerically quite extensively @xcite ; some special solutions to this system are also known @xcite .",
    "third order dispersion becomes important for femtosecond pulses , when group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) is close to zero .",
    "it can be neglected for optical pulses , whose width is of the order of @xmath9 femtoseconds or more , having power of the order of 1 watt and gvd far away from zero . for short range propagation , @xmath8 can also be ignored .",
    "the resulting equation can be written in a dimensionless form by appropriately scaling variables : @xmath10 where @xmath11 $ ] of the incident pulse .",
    "the dimensionless equation obtained reads : @xmath12 where , @xmath13    in a previous study by some of the present authors , localized wave packets with nontrivial chirping were emerged as exact solutions of this equation @xcite .",
    "it was found that chirping has a kinematic component , determined through initial conditions and a dynamical component , originating from self - steepening of pulse and its delayed raman response .",
    "these two chirpings have inverse characteristics and can be used for chirp control .",
    "further , periodic solutions , with sinusoidal functions in fractional linear form , have also been identified .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically investigate wide class of solutions of this system containing both bright and dark solitons .",
    "interestingly , the equation governing dynamics of intensity is found to be the one that governs dynamics of field amplitude in non - linear schrdinger equation with a source @xcite .",
    "this connection is then profitably used to obtain exact solitonic intensity waves of this higher order nlse , possessing nontrivial chirping behavior .",
    "the nlse type bright solitons are found to propagate at superluminal velocity , with dark solitons complementing them in parameter domains , which are experimentally accessible .",
    "interestingly , both the solutions also complement each other in velocity space .",
    "further , we find that dark soliton which are static in systems like nlse , are propagating in this system solely due to presence of higher order nonlinearities .",
    "these solutions show chirality , which depends on the sign of gvd parameter . depending on the kinematic chirp parameter",
    "two distinct domains are obtained . in the first case , if solitons are chiral for anomalous dispersion ( @xmath14 ) , then they are non - chiral for normal dispersion ( @xmath15 ) . in the second case , solitons are strictly chiral in both the dispersion domains .",
    "we then obtain more general localized solutions , through a conformal transformation , which can travel at both sub and superluminal velocities . in order to classify and gain physical understanding of the obtained solutions ,",
    "we then use a pseudo - potential picture , which shows that the solutions separate into bounded periodic oscillations around the well minima and unbounded motion , separated by the so called separatrix solution .",
    "the separatrix solution is identified and the connection of this system with hydrodynamical equations are pointed out .",
    "interestingly , the localized kink type solitons of this system representing the separatrix can be mapped to the separatix solutions of the elliptic function equation , through the aforementioned conformal transformation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we explore the localized dark and bright soliton solutions after connecting the present dynamical system with the nlse .",
    "chirality of the solutions and the effect of chirping have been systematically investigated . in sec .",
    "iii , we find more general solutions , through a fractional linear transform and show they can be both sub and super luminal depending upon various parameters . section iv deals with conclusion and future directions of work .",
    "we seek a travelling wave packet type solution of the hnlse , which can generally be written as : @xmath16 here the travelling coordinate @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are real functions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the scale parameter and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is group velocity of the ansatz solution . substituting ( [ ansatz ] ) in ( [ hnlse ] ) , and equating real and imaginary parts yields two coupled equations : @xmath24 equation ( [ c1 ] )",

    "as is evident , the second term is also of kinematic origin and is infact present in the linear schrdinger equation . the last term is due to higher order nonlinearities , which has a dynamical origin , and leads to chirping that is exactly inverse to that of the former .",

    "interestingly , in the limit @xmath63 one can immediately see that eq.([dark ] ) only allows for static solitons which corroborates with known results .",
    "this essentially implies that presence of higher order nonlinearities allows these kind of dark solitons to propagate with non - zero velocity .",
    "the last consistency relation ( eq.([cc4 ] ) ) determines @xmath64 , the soliton velocity in terms of @xmath41 : @xmath65 we note that @xmath30 and @xmath31 contain @xmath64 explicitly . as defined earlier",
