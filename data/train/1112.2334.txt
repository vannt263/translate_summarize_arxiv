    "the mathematical theory of robotics is based on the notion of a mechanism consisting of links , joints , and rigid platforms .",

    "the _ linkage _ ( or mechanism ) @xmath1 itself is determined by assigning fixed lengths to each of the links of  @xmath3 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for surveys of the mechanical and topological aspects , respectively .",
    "configuration spaces[scspace ] here we concentrate on the most prevalent type of mechanism  @xmath3 :   namely , a finite @xmath5-dimensional simplicial complex ( undirected graph ) , with @xmath6 vertices and @xmath7 edges .",
    "note that a rigid platform is completely specified by listing the lengths of all its diagonals ( i.e. , the distance between any two vertices ) , so we need not list the platforms explicitly .",
    "our results actually hold also for the case when some links of @xmath1 are _ prismatic _ ( or telescopic )  ",
    "i.e. , have variable length    but for simplicity we deal here with the fixed - length case only .    a length - preserving embedding of the vertices of the linkage @xmath1 in a fixed ambient euclidean space  @xmath2",
    "is called a _ configuration _ of @xmath1 . in applications , @xmath8 is most commonly @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the set of all such embeddings , with the natural topology ( and differentiable structure ) , is called the configuration space  of @xmath1 , denoted by  @xmath0 .",
    "such configuration spaces have been studied intensively , with the hope of extracting useful mechanical information from their topological or geometric properties .",
    "much of the mathematical literature has been devoted to the special case when @xmath1 is a closed chain ( polygon ) : see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the general case has also been treated ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "singularities[ssing ] there are two main types of singularities which arise in robotics .",
    "singularities of a mechanism , which appear as singularities of work and actuation maps defined on  @xmath0   (  [ dwork ] ) , have obvious mechanical interpretations , and have been studied intensively ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . on the other hand , the _ topological _ or",

    "the configuration space  @xmath0   is the zero set of a smooth function  @xmath11   ( see  [ dcspace ] below ) , so that  @xmath0   is typically a smooth manifold ( when  @xmath12   is a regular value of @xmath13 ) , and even if not , `` most '' points of  @xmath0   are smooth , since a simple _ necessary _ condition for a point @xmath14 in  @xmath0   to be singular is that  @xmath15 .",
    "thus we are in the common situation where it is relatively straightforward to identify configurations which are _ possibly _ singular , but not so easy to pinpoint when this is in fact so .",
    "our goal in this paper is threefold :    1 .   to provide a straightforward inductive description of",
    "a _ sufficient _ condition for a configuration @xmath14 to be differentiably singular ( in fact , this will imply that @xmath14 is even a topological singularity )    see proposition [ pgensing ] and theorem [ tgensing ] .",
    "2 .   to show that this condition applies generically ( that is , to all but a positive - codimension subset of the singular locus @xmath16 )",
    "  see remarks [ rgensin ] and [ rgensnt ] .",
    "3 .   to obtain a mechanical interpretation for all singularities in the configuration space  of a linkage @xmath1 as a tangential conjunction of two kinematic singularities of type i ( cf.@xcite ) for complementary sub - mechanisms of @xmath1    see remark [ rmechanism ] .",
    "the third goal is completely achieved only in the plane ( for  @xmath17 ) ,   since the model we use for configuration spaces is not completely realistic for rigid rods in  @xmath18 .",
    "see remark [ rccs ] below for an explanation of the difficulties involved .",
    "[ ralgvar ] since the function  @xmath19   defining the configuration space  is a quadratic polynomial ( cf .   [ dcspace ] ) ,  @xmath0   is actually a real algebraic variety .",
    "thus any topological or differentiable singularity @xmath14 is in particular an algebraic singularity ( cf .",
    "ii ,  1.4 ) ) .",
    "somewhat more surprisingly , every real algebraic variety is a union of components of the configuration spaceof some planar linkage  ( @xmath17 )     see @xcite .",
    "thus our results here appear to be statements about any real algebraic variety .",
    "however , the point we wish to make here is not that the cone singularities are the most common ones in algebraic varieties ; it is rather the mechanical interpretation of the generic singularities , and the mechanical underpinnings of the inductive process described in section [ ciccspaces ] .",
    "in fact , while the topological , differentiable , and geometric structures on configuration spaces of linkages can be used to study their mechanics ( cf.@xcite ) , the algebraic structure usually plays no role ( but see @xcite ) .    organization in section [ cbcspaces ] we briefly review some of the basic notions used in this paper . in section [ clecspaces ] ,",

    "we explain the role played by pullbacks of configuration spaces .",
