    "the metallic spinel @xmath0 is a unique 3@xmath2 heavy - fermion ( hf ) compound@xcite",
    ". its @xmath3 coefficient amounts to @xmath4 mj / mol@xmath5k@xmath6 and , strikingly , the low - temperature properties below @xmath7 are quite similar to those of the lanthanide or actinide hf compounds@xcite . since the @xmath2 electrons , 1.5 per vanadium ion , are responsible for both transport and magnetism in @xmath0 , it is not trivial whether one can apply a scenario analogous to the conventional hf mechanism .",
    "moreover , the large spatial extent of @xmath2 orbitals compared with well - localized @xmath8 orbitals is also unfavorable for the electrons to be treated as localized .",
    "in fact , some transport properties , such as the steep increase of resistivity above @xmath9@xcite and the pressure - induced metal - insulator transition@xcite , are different from those of the typical @xmath8-electron hf compounds .",
    "apart from the hf behavior , geometrical frustration is another specific feature of this system .",
    "the b site of the normal - spinel ( @xmath10 ) is known to form the network of corner - sharing tetrahedra ( pyrochlore lattice ) . in most spinels ,",
    "the geometric frustration is partially released by the structural phase transition . as a result",
    ", the ordered ground state is realized in the tetragonal phase , such as the possible charge ordering in @xmath11 or the nel ordering in @xmath12@xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 remains cubic and no static magnetic order was observed down to 0.02 k. the curie - weiss fit of the susceptibility ( @xmath13 ) results in an effective spin-1/2 moment per v with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling ( @xmath14)@xcite .",
    "af long range order ( lro ) will be suppressed by the geometric frustration and , indeed , the inelastic neutron scattering experiment captures the development of short - range af correlations below @xmath15@xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the large enhancement of @xmath3 is shared by other geometrically frustrated systems with strong af spin fluctuations , like @xmath16@xcite and @xmath17-mn@xcite .",
    "these facts seem to suggest that the formation of the heavy - mass @xmath2 electron is related to the geometric frustration . in view of the geometric frustration",
    ", it should be noted that , already at the 10% electron doping , the hf ground state is easily destroyed into the spin - glass phase@xcite .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "the crystal filed around each v atom is nearly cubic with a slight trigonal distortion .",
    "the band - structure calculations indicate that the fermi level lies within the cubic-@xmath1 manifold with a bandwidth of about 2 ev@xcite , which is actually the superposition of the two components ; the relatively narrow @xmath18 ( @xmath19 1ev ) and the broad @xmath20 orbital ( @xmath19 2 ev ) of the @xmath21 group .",
    "matsuno @xmath22 considered this trigonal split less important , and stressed the importance of the geometric frustration and/or orbital degeneracy@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lda+@xmath23 calculation by anisimov @xmath22 suggested that the correlation effect leads to the orbital polarization , where the @xmath18 orbital is occupied singly to form a localized spin-1/2 moment and the rest 0.5 electron fills the @xmath20 band .",
    "thereby , they proposed the kondo scenario based on the effective anderson impurity model@xcite .    followed by these band - structure calculations ,",
    "various theoretical models are proposed in connection with the microscopic origin of the 3@xmath2 hf behavior@xcite .",
    "especially , the role of the geometric frustration has been featured in recent studies .",
    "motivated by the curie - weiss law around room temperature , the formation of the localized @xmath24 is assumed by several authors on the grounds of the orbital polarization@xcite or the local valence fluctuations@xcite . in these treatments",
    "the spin frustration is their main concern .    in this paper",
    ", we consider that the present system realizes the prototypical itinerant frustrated model and investigate the @xmath1-band pyrochlore hubbard model with particular emphasis on orbital fluctuations . within the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "scheme , all kinds of fluctuations are included simultaneously without prejudice . in principle",
    ", geometric frustration prevents any kinds of lro and thus the large @xmath3 would be expected by the resultant enhanced fluctuations . in this scenario , not only the spin but also both of the orbital and spin - orbital fluctuations are responsible for the enhancement . to our knowledge , this is the first theoretical attempt to attribute the heavy - mass @xmath2 electron directly to the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the instability itself of the same model was discussed by tsunetsugu@xcite .",
    "we have explicitly calculated the @xmath25-linear coefficient of the imaginary part of the generalized susceptibility and found the large enhancement of @xmath3 mainly due to the spin - orbital fluctuations .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice is a fcc - array of tetrahedra .",
    "the cubic unit cell shown in fig . [ lattice ] contains 16 lattice points covered by 4 tetrahedra and the primitive unit cell includes a single tetrahedron .",
    "therefore the @xmath1 electrons are specified by the following 4 indices ; the unit cell ( denoted by @xmath26 ) , the sublattice ( @xmath27 ) , the orbital ( @xmath28 ) , and the spin ( @xmath29 ) , where @xmath30 is the number of the cubic unit cell along one direction . by using the standard notation of the multi - band hubbard model , the @xmath1-band hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice",
    "is given by @xmath31 ; @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the transfer integral between the @xmath34 orbital at @xmath35 sublattice and the @xmath36 orbital at @xmath37 sublattice when @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the parameter of @xmath39 type is also included to describe the trigonal split of @xmath1 , @xmath40 . since the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hoppings already depend on the bond direction and the orbital symmetry the nn tight - binding model would be sufficient for the present study . by the symmetry relation ,",
    "all the hopping matrices are represented by the following three independent parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 symmetry of the unit cell , as well as the spin su(2 ) , are incorporated in the @xmath45 matrix @xmath46 , though here we do not display the matrix explicitly .",
    "the tight - binding fit of the lapw band - structure calculation gives the parameters in @xmath46 to be @xmath47 ev , @xmath48 ev , and @xmath49 ev@xcite . by applying the orthogonal transformation @xmath50",

    "3 along some typical symmetric lines . the almost flat bands near the fermi level results in high density of state ( dos ) at the fermi level .",
    "actually , the @xmath3 coefficient estimated from the dos of the band - structure calculation is relatively large ; @xmath55 17 mj / mol@xmath5k@xcite .",
    "however , the experimentally observed value ( @xmath56 ) is about 25 times larger than @xmath57 . as a possible origin of this enhancement , in the following , we consider the effect of electron correlations from the weak - coupling limit .",

    "the horizontal straight line is the fermi level for the quarter filling.,width=325 ]",
    "in order to describe various kinds of fluctuations concerning the @xmath1 electrons in a simple way , we introduce the thirty - five generators of the su(6 ) group @xmath58 ) and the identity operator @xmath59 , where the normalization condition is @xmath60 .",
    "the su(6 ) generators are classified into the pure spin , the pure orbital and the spin - orbital coupled components .",
    "spin and orbital degrees of freedom are described by the generators of su(2 ) ( @xmath61 ; three dimensions ) and su(3 ) ( @xmath62 ; eight dimensions ) groups , respectively , and the spin - orbital coupled modes are made of the products of the two ( @xmath63 ; twenty four dimensions ) . to be explicit , these operators are represented by using the electron creation and annihilation operators as follows , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the pauli and the gell - mann matrices in the standard notations@xcite , respectively .",
    "note that the overall signs of non - diagonal operators for different sublattices are selected to be consistent with the @xmath44 unit - cell symmetry .",
    "since the trigonal distortion in @xmath46 violates the @xmath67 orbital symmetry , the usual representations of the @xmath1 orbital by the fictitious @xmath68 and its higher moments do not reflect the proper symmetry .",
    "instead we construct the tensor products of the real @xmath69 moment and reduce them into the irreducible representations of @xmath44 in the cubic @xmath1 subspace . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath66 is the proper set of basis , which is classified into three irreducible representations ; @xmath70-dipolar moments ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath70-quadrupolar moments ( @xmath72 ) , and @xmath73-quadrupolar moments ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "next we transform the interaction part of hamiltonian in terms of @xmath75 s so that @xmath76 except for a constant energy shift . here",
    "@xmath77 s are a function of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "such transformation is always possible for any @xmath78 and @xmath79 , though the choice of @xmath77 is not unique because of the spin rotational invariance and/or the identity @xmath80 . by applying a coupling constant integration together with eq .",

    "including the charge degree of freedom ( @xmath59 ) , our @xmath83 is the @xmath84 matrix with the row index @xmath85 and the column @xmath86 .",
    "since we are concerned with the paramagnetic state , as suggested by the experiment , the su(2 ) symmetry ensures that @xmath83 is decomposed into the spin singlet and triplet sectors .",
    "each sector is represented by the charge - charge ( denoted by @xmath87 ) and the @xmath88-@xmath88 susceptibilities ( @xmath89 ) , respectively .",
    "in these two @xmath90 matrices , the spin indices ( @xmath91 ) is reduced and the rest indices are the row index @xmath92 and the column @xmath93 . here",

    ", @xmath87 describes the correlations among the charge ( @xmath94 ) and the orbital ( @xmath95 ) , while @xmath89 among the spin ( @xmath94 ) and the spin - orbital ( @xmath95 ) . by using these notations ,",
    "the rpa equations are given as follows , @xmath96 since the interaction is local , the interaction matrices ( @xmath97 ) are always @xmath35-diagonal and independent of @xmath35 .",
    "thus the rest indices are row @xmath17 and column @xmath98 .",
    "moreover the @xmath99 matrices @xmath97 may have a simple representation .",
    "this is because @xmath46 has the @xmath44 symmetry and eq .",
    "( [ rpa ] ) is invariant under any @xmath44 transformation .",
    "therefore , @xmath97 s must be diagonal and these matrix elements are the same within each irreducible representation , see table [ table1 ] .",

    "( [ rpa ] ) is the paramagnetic susceptibility of the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "when we calculate @xmath102 of the usual single band hubbard model , the hartree - fock terms just renormalize the chemical potential . in our model",
    "the hartree term similarly changes the diagonal part of @xmath46 , however the fock terms introduce off - diagonal terms of the orbital hoppings on the same site , giving rise to the crystal field effect .",
    "this crystal field is totally symmetric concerning the entire unit cell , but its local symmetry on each sublattice is trigonal . the effect of this additional field is included in the band - structure calculations .",
    "therefore the free paramagnetic susceptibility calculated by using the tight - binding parameters gives the appropriate @xmath101 .",
    "in the actual calculation , we used the free @xmath102 per tetrahedron of the form @xmath103 and rotated the orbital basis from @xmath104 into @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the mass enhancement in @xmath3 , let us now focus on the @xmath107-linear part of @xmath108 in the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) . as is seen from the band structure ( fig . [ band ] ) , nothing singular would happen in @xmath102 , therefore a constant @xmath109 and an @xmath107-linear @xmath110 behaviors are expected in the leading order of @xmath107 .",
    "then it is sufficient to solve the rpa equations in the lowest order of @xmath111 . for the 1/2-filled @xmath112-band pyrochlore hubbard model , in contrast ,",
    "the complete matching of the fermi level and flat bands brings a non - fermi liquid behavior@xcite . as for the still - unfixed @xmath113 ,",
    "we take @xmath114 it is easy to check that the @xmath77 s of this form reproduce the original interaction term , eq . ( [ xx ] ) .",
    "this choice is natural in the sense that @xmath115 reflects the symmetry of the non - interaction term ( su(2 ) and @xmath44 ) .",
    "we neglect the weak dependence of @xmath102 on the interaction through the fock terms for simplicity , then the @xmath116-integral in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) can be performed analytically .",
    "after some calculations , @xmath3 coefficient ( = @xmath117 ) per tetrahedron is given by @xmath118with @xmath119 this equation is exact after taking @xmath120 and @xmath121 limit .",
    "note that we neglect the zero - point fluctuation term in the @xmath107 integral because it will only show a weak temperature dependence through that of @xmath102 .",
    "finally we numerically estimate @xmath122 in the su(6 ) limit ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) , where the orbital fluctuations are mostly enhanced . for this purpose , we calculated the free susceptibility , eq .",
    "( [ kai0 ] ) , for the parameter set of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we checked the convergence of @xmath102 against @xmath107 and @xmath30 along some symmetric lines .",
    "especially , we confirmed that @xmath127 shows a clear @xmath107-linear dependence in the range of @xmath128 ev .",
    "the convergence of the @xmath107-linear coefficient regarding the system size ( @xmath129 ) is fairly good except for a few points very close to the @xmath130 point . as a result",
    ", we obtained the @xmath3-value per @xmath0 mole as shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] .",
    "the total @xmath3 is the summation of the contributions from charge ( denoted by @xmath131 ) , spin ( @xmath132 ) , orbital ( @xmath133 ) , and spin - orbital fluctuations ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the critical value @xmath135 is about 0.92 ev and there the complicated eigenvectors , made of the four - sublattice summations of the spin and spin - orbital components with quadrupole orbital modes , characterize the instability at the wave vector near @xmath130 point .",
    "since we fixed @xmath107 finite and took the limit of @xmath136 , our calculated @xmath109 does not correspond to the @xmath137 limit at @xmath130 point .",
    "therefore we can not determine that the most prominent modes are just at the @xmath130 point or not .",
    "the real part of @xmath102 is studied for different hopping parameters at zero temperature@xcite . in the present calculation",
    ", we do not detect the peak structure around @xmath138 and @xmath139 points found in @xcite .",
    "the reason for the difference might be that our calculations have done at finite @xmath25 and/or these single modes are quite sensitive to the nesting of the fermi surface .    fig .",
    "[ gamma ] shows that the correct order of @xmath3 can be reproduced even away from the critical point , say @xmath140 .",
    "around there , the enhancement of @xmath122 ( about 80% ) is mainly attributed to the various spin - orbital fluctuations .",
    "both spin and spin - orbital fluctuations contribute @xmath122 by the same order as a single component .",
    "however , the magnitude of the components , 3 for spin and 24 for spin - orbital modes , results in the different contribution in @xmath122 . in order to gain the same enhancement solely by the spin fluctuations , @xmath23 must be very close to @xmath135 even after the inclusion of @xmath79 term .",
    "away from the @xmath135 , the enhancement of @xmath122 comes from the entire momentum space because the spin and spin - orbital fluctuations have rather weak @xmath141-dependences .",
    "this result seems to be consistent with the naive picture that the geometric frustration induces local fluctuations , which is responsible for the heavy mass .",
    "the graph shows @xmath3 value per formula unit of @xmath0 mole . the contributions from charge , spin , orbital , and spin - orbital fluctuations are labeled by @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively.,width=325 ]",
    "in conclusion we have studied the origin of the large enhancement of @xmath3 in liv@xmath144o@xmath145 based on the 1/4 filled @xmath1-band pyrochlore hubbard model .",
    "we introduced @xmath44 irreducible operators for orbital density operators and derived the rpa equations in a simple form .",
    "the @xmath122 obtained by the coupling constant integration of @xmath108 is enhanced typically by order of 10 due to the spin - orbital fluctuations compared with the @xmath146 due to the spin alone .",
    "this conclusion itself seems to be general for the orbital disordered system and thus it may be possible to apply the present scenario to other systems , such as y(sc)mn@xmath144 and @xmath17-mn . to be more specific to liv@xmath144o@xmath145",
    ", the calculated @xmath122 value is of the same order as @xmath56 .",
    "however , it should be noted that our simple theory does not include the effect of the geometrical frustrations sufficiently , since the mode - mode coupling between various fluctuations is neglected . in general , the rpa approximation overestimates the fluctuations , therefore the most prominent mode itself would be suppressed and the @xmath135 becomes larger if we include the couplings between the modes with different momenta . at the same time , the overall structure of @xmath83 in @xmath141 space would change into more and more structure - less and thus the additional enhancement of @xmath3 could be expected .",
    "it is well - known that the mode - mode coupling theory leads to the curie - weiss behavior of the magnetic susceptibility . as for the @xmath147 ,",
    "it is of order of 0.1 in the rpa approximation .",
    "this value would be increased by including @xmath79 , although it is not clear whether the hund s rule coupling is sufficient to obtain @xmath148 . to address the similarity to the 4@xmath8 hf compounds ,",
    "we need to develop a more sophisticated theory including the coupling between fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuation exchange approximation for the multi - band model would be useful as the next step .",
