    "the last quarter of a century have changed the status of general relativity from a purely theoretical discipline to a practically important science .",
    "present accuracy of astronomical observations requires relativistic description of light propagation as well as the relativistically correct treatment of the dynamics of the extended celestial bodies . as a result ,",
    "some of the leading static - field post - newtonian perturbations in the dynamics of the planets , the moon and artificial satellites have been included in the equations of motion , and in time and position transformation . due to enormous progress in the accuracy of astronomical observations",
    "we must now study the possibility of taking into account the much smaller relativistic effects caused by the post - post - newtonian corrections to the solar gravitational field as well as the post - newtonian contributions from the lunar and planetary gravity .",
    "it is also well understood that effects due to non - stationary behavior of the solar system gravitational field as well as its deviation from spherical symmetry should be also considered .",
    "recent advances in the accuracy of astrometric observations have demonstrated importance of taking into account the relativistic effects introduced by the solar system s gravitational environment .",
    "it is known that the reduction of the hipparcos data has necessitated the inclusion of stellar aberration up to the terms of the second order in @xmath3 , and the general relativistic treatment of light bending due to the gravitational field of the sun ( see discussion in @xcite ) and earth ( please refer to analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "the prospect of new high precision astrometric measurements from space with the space interferometry mission , will require inclusion of relativistic effects at the @xmath4 level as shown in @xcite . at the level of accuracy expected from sim",
    ", even more subtle gravitational effects on astrometry from within the solar system will start to become apparent , such as the monopole and the quadrupole components of the gravitational fields of the planets and the gravito - magnetic effects caused by their motions and rotations .",
    "thus , the identification of all possible sources of ` astrometric ' noise that may contribute to the future sim astrometric campaign , is well justified .",
    "this work organized as follows : section [ sec : mon_defl ] discusses the influence of the relativistic deflection of light by the monopole components of the gravitational fields of the solar system s bodies .",
    "we present the model and our estimates for the most important effects that will be influencing astrometric observations of a few microarcsecond ( @xmath5as ) accuracy , that will be made from within the solar system .",
    "section [ sec : three_env ] will specifically address three the most intense gravitational environments in the solar system , namely the solar deflection of light and the gravitational defections in the vicinities of the jupiter and the earth . in section [ sec : constr ] we will discuss the constraints derived from the monopole deflection of light on the navigation of the spacecraft and the accuracy of the solar system ephemerides .",
    "we study a possibility of improvement in accuracy of determination of ppn parameter @xmath1 via astrometric tests of general relativity in the solar system . in section [ sec : high_multipoles ] we will discuss the effects of the gravitational deflection of light by the higher gravitational multipoles ( both mass and current ones ) of some of the bodies in the solar system .",
    "we will conclude the paper with the discussion of the results obtained and our recommendations for future studies .",
    "prediction of the gravitational deflection of light was one of the first successes of general relativity .",
    "since the first confirmation by the eddington expedition in 1919 , the effect of gravitational deflection has been studied quite extensively and currently analysis of almost every precise astronomical measurement must take this effect into account ( see @xcite ) .",
    "according to general relativity , the light rays propagating near a gravitating body are achromatically scattered by the curvature of the space - time generated by the body s gravity field .",
    "the whole trajectory of the light ray is bent towards the body by an angle depending on the strength of the body s gravity .",
    "the solar gravity field produces the largest effect on the light traversing the solar system .    in the ppn formalism",
    "( please refer to @xcite ) , to first order in the gravitational constant , @xmath6 , the solar deflection angle @xmath7 depends only on the solar mass @xmath8 and the impact parameter @xmath9 relative to the sun : @xmath10 the star is assumed to be at a very large distance compared to the sun , and @xmath11 is the angular separation between the deflector and the star . with the space observations carried out by sim , @xmath11 is not necessarily a small angle . the relevant geometry and notations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deflect ] .      the absolute magnitude for the light deflection angle is maximal for the rays grazing the solar photosphere , e.g. @xmath12 mas .",
    "most of the measurements of the gravitational deflection to date involved the solar gravity field , planets in the solar system or gravitational lenses .",
    "thus , relativistic deflection of light has been observed , with various degrees of precision , on distance scales of @xmath13 to @xmath14 m , and on mass scales from @xmath15 to @xmath16 solar masses , the upper ranges determined from the gravitational lensing of quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter @xmath1 in the expression ( [ eq : deflec0 ] ) represents the measure of the curvature of the space - time created by the unit rest mass ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that general relativity , when analyzed in standard ppn gauge , gives : @xmath17 .",
    "the brans - dicke theory is the most famous among the alternative theories of gravity .",
    "it contains , besides the metric tensor , a scalar field @xmath18 and an arbitrary coupling constant @xmath19 , related to this ppn parameter as @xmath20 . the present limit",
    "@xmath21 , that was recently obtained by @xcite , gives the constraint @xmath22 .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : deflect ] we emphasized the fact that the difference of the apparent position of the source from it s true position depends on the impact parameter of the incoming light with respect to the deflector . for the astrometric accuracy of a few @xmath5as and , in the case when the sun is the deflector , positions of all observed sources experiencing such an apparent displacement , except the ones that are on exactly opposite side from the instrument with respect to the sun , e.g. @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the light rays coming from these sources do not experience gravitational deflection at all .",
    "thus , those observations may serve as an anchor to allow one to remove the effects of the light bending from the high accuracy astrometric catalogues .",
    "this is why , in order to correctly account for the effect of gravitational deflection , it is important to process together the data taken with the different separation angles from the deflector .",
    "sim will be observing the sky in a 15@xmath0 patches of sky , as oppose to the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) that may simultaneously observe sources with a much larger separations on the sky . to reflect this difference , in our further estimations we will present results for the two types of astrometric measurements , namely for the absolute ( single ray deflection ) and differential ( two sources separated by the 15@xmath0 field of view ) observations .      in this section",
    "we will address the question of how the relativistic dynamics of our solar system will influence the high - precision astrometric observations with sim .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the model , the parameterization of the quantities involved , as well as the physical meaning of the obtained contributions . the main goal of this section is to present a comparative analysis of the various relativistic effects whose presence must be taken into account in the modeling propagation of light through the solar system . in particular we will concentrate on the effect of the relativistic deflection of light traversing our solar system s internal gravitational environment .",
    "the first step into a relativistic modeling of the light path consists of determining the direction of the incoming photon as measured by an observer located in the solar system as a function of the barycentric coordinate position of the light source .",
    "apart from second and third orders aberration the only other sizable effect is linked to the bending of light rays in the gravitational field of solar system bodies as shown by @xcite .",
    "effects of the gravitational monopole deflection of light are the largest among those in the solar system . in order to properly describe this gravitational light - deflecting phenomenon",
    ", one needs to define the relativistic gravity geometric contribution , @xmath24 , to the optical path difference ( opd ) that is measurable by an interferometer in solar orbit . in a weak gravity field approximation , to first order in gravitational constant @xmath6 , an additional optical path difference introduced by the gravitational bending ( or , more specifically for the case of an interferometer , the gravitational delay , @xmath25 , see @xcite ) of the electromagnetic signals , @xmath26 , takes the most simple and elegant form : @xmath27 ,   \\label{eq : defl0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the distance from sim to a deflecting body @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the unit vector in this direction .",
    "also @xmath31  and @xmath32 are the vector of interferometer s baseline and the unit vector of the unperturbed direction to the source at infinity correspondingly .",
    "note that eq.([eq : defl0 ] ) is written in the approximation neglecting the terms of the order @xmath33 , which could be reinstated , if needed .",
    "where @xmath35 is the angle of the baseline s orientation with respect to the instantaneous body - centric coordinate frame , @xmath36 is the right assention angle of the interferometer as seen from the this frame and @xmath37 is the direction to the observed source correspondingly .",
    "the geometry of the problem and the discussed notations are presented in the figure [ fig : defl_param ] .",
    "it is convenient to express the gravitational contribution to the total optical path difference eq.([eq : defl0 ] ) in terms of the deflector and the source separation angle @xmath38 as observed by the interferometer .",
    "the necessary relation that expresses the source s position angle @xmath37 via the separation angle @xmath38 may be given as : @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{eq : theta_chi}\\ ] ] as a result , we can now rewrite the gravitational deflection s contribution to the total opd , eq.([eq : defl0 ] ) , in the following form : @xmath40 , \\label{eq : defl_chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "we can further assume that the source is located at a very large distance , @xmath42 , compare to the distance between the interferometer and the deflector , so that the following inequality holds @xmath43 for every body in the solar system .",
    "this allows us to neglect the presence of the last term in the equation eq.([eq : theta_chi ] ) for the estimation purposes only .",
    "also a complete analysis of phenomenon of the gravitational deflection of light will have to account for the time dependency in all the quantities involved .",
    "thus , one will have to use the knowledge of the position of the spacecraft in the solar system s barycentric reference frame , the instrument s orientation in the proper coordinate frame , the time that was spent in a particular orientation , the history of all the maneuvers and re - pointings of the instrument , etc .",
    "these issues are closely related to the principles of the operational mode of the instrument that is currently still being developed .",
    "equation eq.([eq : defl_chi ] ) represents the fact that the gravitational field is affecting the propagation of the electromagnetic signals in a two ways , namely by delaying them and by deflecting the light s trajectory from the rectilinear one .",
    "thus , the first term in the square brackets on the right hand - side of this equation is the term that describes the gravitational delay of the infallen electromagnetic signal .",
    "this term is independent on the source s position on the sky and depends only on the orientation of the baseline vector and the direction to the deflector .",
    "more precisely , it depends on the gravity generated by the body at the interferometer s location and the projected baseline vector onto the direction to the source @xmath44 . for the purposes of this study it is sufficient to discuss only the magnitude of this effect in terms of its contribution to the astrometric measurement : @xmath45    the second term in the equation eq.([eq : defl_chi ] )",
    "is responsible for the relativistic deflection of light and will be the main topic of our further discussion . in our future analysis",
    "we will be interested only in magnitudes of the angles of relativistic deflection of light , so it is convenient to choose [ only for the estimation purposes ! ] such an orientation of the baseline vector ( e.g. angle @xmath35 ) and the vector of mutual orientation of the instrument and the deflecting body ( e.g. angle @xmath36 ) that maximizes the effect of the gravitational deflection of light . by choosing the orientation angles as @xmath46",
    ", we can are neglect it s presence .",
    "this allows one to concentrate only on the phenomenon of the gravitational deflection and to re - write the contribution of this effect to the total opd , eq.([eq : defl_chi ] ) , as @xmath47 with individual contributions @xmath48 given by @xmath49    it is also convenient express this additional opd in terms of the corresponding deflection angles @xmath50 , which simply have the form : @xmath51 note that @xmath52 is the impact parameter of the incident light ray with respect to a particular deflector as seen by the interferometer . by substituting this result into the formula ( [ eq : b_opd ] )",
    "one obtains expression similar to that given by eq.([eq : deflec0 ] ) .",
    "the obtained expressions eqs.([eq : b_opd])-([eq : b_defl ] ) are most appropriate to estimate the magnitude of the gravitational bending effects introduced into absolute astrometric measurements .",
    "they are useful in understanding the `` asymptotic value '' of the effect for a large number of observations , @xmath53 .",
    "however , one needs an additional set of equations suitable to describe the accuracy of measurements during differential astrometry studies with sim .",
    "the necessary expression for the differential opd may be simply obtained by subtracting opds for the different sources one from one another .",
    "this procedure resulted in the following expression : @xmath54 , \\label{eq : delay}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the barycentric positions of the primary and the secondary objects . by using parameterization for the quantities involved similar to that above",
    ", this expression may be presented in terms of the deflector - source separation angles , @xmath57 , as follows : @xmath58    the purpose of this was was only to estimate the influence of the solar system s gravity field on the propagation of light .",
    "we will concentrate on obtaining the magnitudes of the deflection angles only and will not try to reconstruct the complicated functional dependency of the effect on the number of mutual orientation angles .",
    "this allows us use the expression eq.([eq : defl_chi_diff ] ) with such an orientation between the baseline vector , @xmath35 , and deflector@xmath59instrument angle , @xmath36 , that maximizes contribution of each individual deflector for a particular orbital position of the spacecraft . as a result",
    ", we may well require that @xmath46 and expression eq.([eq : defl_chi_diff ] ) may be re - written as @xmath60 , with the individual contributions @xmath61 having the form @xmath62        in this section we will obtain the estimates for the effects that characterize the intensity of the gravitational environment in the solar system . the most natural and convenient way to do that is to discuss the magnitudes of the angles of the gravitational deflection of light rays that grazing the surfaces of the celestial bodies .",

    "most important is that one will have to permanently monitor the presence of some of the bodies of the solar system during all astrometric observations , independently on the position of the spacecraft in it s solar orbit and the observing direction .",
    "the bodies that introduce the biggest astrometric inhomogeneity are the sun , the jupiter and the earth ( especially at the beginning of the mission , when the spacecraft is in the earth immediate proximity ) .",
