    "recently the large hadron collider ( lhc ) discovered a new particle resonance that weighs about 125gev@xmath5 , see refs .",
    "@xcite , which may indeed be the long sought after higgs boson . while its presence is not in doubt , the properties of this particle are yet to be completely determined .",
    "what is clear is that it is electrically neutral , and that it is not a vector resonance , and almost certainly has spin-0 .",
    "whether or not it is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson will be decided by the spin and partiy properties of the particle , and also its couplings with other particles .",
    "the lhc being a hadronic machine may not be able to exhaustively study the properties of this particle .",
    "the proposed international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , which is an @xmath6 collider , will carry out precision experiments on sm particles and establish their properties including that of the purported higgs boson .",
    "it has been pointed out , see ref .  @xcite that beam polarization could significantly enhance the sensitivity of the machine to probe beyond the sm signals .    the standard higgs mechanism employed by the sm as a solution to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )",
    "introduces one higgs state ( doublet of @xmath7 ) , resulting in a physical cp - even scalar particle . however , many extensions of the ewsb mechanism like the supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions or the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) predict more than one physical scalar particle . in cp - conserving models ,",
    "these states are either cp - even or cp - odd .",
    "while it is too early to identify the cp nature of the new resonance at 125gev@xmath5 , it is almost certainly not a purely cp - odd state .",
    "this follows from the fact that one of the discovery channels involve @xmath8 coupling , which would have been absent if @xmath1 was purely cp - odd .",
    "this was also indicated from the recent data analysis results of both atlas@xcite and cms@xcite , where they set an exclusion limit of around @xmath9 for pure cp - odd ( @xmath10 ) state .",
    "however a cp - mixed state can fit in very well with the data .",
    "cp - mixed states are possible in cp - violating versions of the susy models @xcite , as well as in the general 2hdm with cp violation in the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "indeed , there had been many interesting studies on cp - violating higgs sector within different versions of the susy models @xcite , and in other models .",
    "some of the recent studies along these lines in the light of new lhc discovery may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "being heaviest among the sm particles , the top quark coupling to the higgs boson is the strongest , and therefore most promising to study the cp nature of the resonance .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has pointed out that the ilc is an ideal setting to probe the cp nature of the higgs boson in the process @xmath11 here the deviation of the higgs coupling to the top quark was parametrized by considering a cp - mixed higgs state .",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar parts of such a cp - mixed higgs boson will couple differently to different polarization combinations of the top quark and top antiquark .",
    "a measurement of top quark polarization ( and/or polarization asymmetry ) could therefore probe the cp - nature of the particle .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that a combined use of total cross section and its energy dependence , the polarization asymmetry of the top quark and the up - down asymmetry of the antitop with respect to the top - electron plane can significantly help in determining the cp properties in the event of cp conservation and in that of mixing in the case of cp violation .",
    "the properties in the decay to @xmath12 lepton pairs has also been considered , see ref .",
    "@xcite , in the process @xmath13 .",
    "related papers are refs .  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , quite independently of the considerations of the cp properties of the higgs boson , there have been several studies of process in eq .",
    "( [ ourprocess ] ) in the context of the measurement of the top quark yukawa coupling to the higgs . for some early work , see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "more recently the process has attracted renewed attention : in refs .",
    "@xcite the size of the signal and backgrounds when various decays are considered has been studied , while the issue of the process at a centre of mass energy of 500gev due to the qcd enhancement of the crosssection near @xmath14 threshold has been considered in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and finally the issue of a direct measurement using the semi - leptonic final state from the decays of the @xmath15 arising from the decays of the top quarks is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "keeping in mind the above considerations , we now wish to study the possibility of fingerprinting the departure from the cp - even case @xcite in decay distributions of the process in eq .",
    "( [ ourprocess ] ) , which will necessarily require us to go beyond the analytical approach . in our study we commit ourselves to two definite scenarios which we denote as model i and model ii .",
    "model i corresponds to the minimal extension of the sm with one additional pseudo - scalar degree of freedom , which mixes with the sm scalar to form the physical higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "this model is characterized by one free parameter , which is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "model ii is a more realistic case similar to the cp - violating 2hdm model which has some essential features that make it quite different from model i. in particular , there is no theoretical constraint on parameters denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 ( as described in the section  [ formalism ] ) and thus permits a more general discussion .",
    "however , we confine ourselves to some reasonable ranges for these parameters guided by the experimental indications that the resonance is close to a cp - even case .    in order to meet our objectives , considering that these are not amenable to analytical methods , and must necessarily involve numerical packages of great sophistication and complexity , we have used the integrated monte - carlo and event generation package whizard @xcite for our study .",
    "the sm , as well as some of its popular extensions are already implemented in this package .",
    "further , any new model described through a lagrangian can be incorporated into this package through an interface @xcite generated using feynrules @xcite .",
    "in particular , in our work we introduce decays for the top - quark which can be implemented in whizard .",
    "our signal processes are @xmath19 where the first final state is the result of @xmath14 pair decay , keeping @xmath1 fully reconstructed , while the second one considers the decay of @xmath1 into @xmath2 pair .",
    "in contrast to the existing studies of the @xmath20 production , we consider the effect of cp - violating higgs boson in the decay spectrum of both the top quark as well as the higgs boson itself , noting that the decay distributions are the spin analysers of the parent particle .    the scheme of this paper is as follows . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we first introduce and describe the basic structure of an indefinite cp higgs sector in the two scenarios mentioned above . in section [ process ]",
    "we describe the processes we consider . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the results of our analysis . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we present a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the formalism we have adopted . in the standard higgs mechanism with one higgs doublet acquiring vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , there is only one cp - even physical scalar field . in the simplest extensions of this with an additional complex singlet or complex doublet ,",
    "there are cp - odd states along with one or more cp - even states .",
    "if cp symmetry is violated in the higgs sector , the physical higgs states could be in a cp - mixed state . in this article",
    "we focus our attention on such a scenario , and its possible implications on the @xmath20 production at the ilc .",
    "a study of this process will thus give information on the cp nature of the higgs boson .",
    "the process @xmath21 goes through the channels shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] .",
    "the two channels with higgs boson radiating off the top quark or antiquark dominate the cross section , with about a few percent contribution from the third channel with the higgs radiating off the @xmath22 .     in standard model .",

    ", the parameters take values @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .      in a minimal extension of the sm case",
    ", one imagines the presence of an additional pseudo - scalar degree of freedom @xmath30 , which mixes with the scalar degree of freedom to produce a physical state : @xmath31 we call this scenario as model i in the rest of this article .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath16 represent the mixing , and are related to each other by @xmath32 since the sm gauge boson , @xmath22 does not couple to the pseudo - scalar degree of freedom , we have @xmath33 in this scenario .",
    "the down - type quarks as well as the charged leptons will also have the same coupling structure as that of the up - type quarks , so that , for example , the @xmath16-quark couplings become @xmath34      while model i has the advantage in phenomenological analysis that there is only one free parameter , in most of the realistic cases of extensions beyond the sm the higgs sector is more complex . for example , in the 2hdm and in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) there are two higgs doublet fields , leading to two neutral scalar bosons and one pseudoscalar boson in the physical spectrum in the cp - conserving case . denoting the gauge eigenstates of the scalar fields as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the mass eigenstates as @xmath26 and @xmath37 , we can write down the relation between them in terms of the mixing matrix as follows . @xmath38 h\\end{array}\\right)= \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\cos\\alpha&\\sin\\alpha\\\\[1 mm ]                    -\\sin\\alpha&\\cos\\alpha \\end{array}\\right)~ \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\phi_1\\\\[1 mm ] \\phi_2\\end{array}\\right).\\ ] ]    in the cp - violating case , all the three degrees of freedom mix to give cp - mixed physical mass eigenstates as below .",

    "this , in effect , removes the restricting relations between the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath18 . for ready reference",
    "we take the example of mssm case ( or 2hdm ) with and without cp violation in the higgs sector , and list in table  [ tab : mssm ] the couplings of the higgs boson with the fermions and the gauge bosons , where @xmath41 is the ratio of the vev s of the two higgs fields . comparing table  [ tab : mssm ] with eq .",

    "we consider only one light higgs boson @xmath50 of mass around 125gev/@xmath51 , with the other two are heavy enough to be safely away from lhc bounds .",
    "noting that for the top quark , the parameter @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath52 , we confine our studies to low @xmath41 cases .",
    "some illustrative values of mixing and the corresponding values of the couplings are given in table  [ tab:2hdm_coupl ] .",
    "our analysis based on these couplings is given below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_roots](middle ) we plot the total production cross section for different mentioned cases .",
    "the cross section differs substantially from sm as now @xmath17 and @xmath16 parameters are bit free unlike model i case where they are constrained by eq .",
    "[ model1constr ] .",
    "[ fig : mii_up_t_800 ] presents the angular , energy and @xmath53 distributions of the @xmath54 , the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath15 pair , and the energy and @xmath53 distributions of the higgs boson in the process @xmath55 .",
    "remember that in case of p1 and p4 we have only 1% of the pseudoscalar admixture in the higgs boson .",
    "notice that unlike in the case of model i , here , the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath16 can be larger than 1 , and vary with @xmath41 for the same scalar - pseudoscalar composition of the higgs boson . in p1 case , the deviation from the sm is large , which could further be enhanced with the use of beam polarization . for larger @xmath41 value , as indicated by p4 , the effect is negligible for small cp - mixing .",
    "somewhat larger deviation .",
    "with 10% and 25% cp - mixing , deviations are significantly large to be observed in the case of @xmath56 ( p5 and p6 , respectively ) , while for @xmath57 ( p2 and p3 , respectively ) the deviations are not so much .",
    "recall that model i required much larger mixing for the deviations to be significant .",
    "we also presented the forward - backward asymmetery values in table  [ tab : afb_m2 ] for discussed sets .",
    "the asymmetry value show around 7% deviation from sm in unpolarized case while for polarized case the deviation is almost negligible .",
    "coming to the process @xmath58 , the energy , angle and @xmath53 distributions of the top quark , the invariant mass of the @xmath14 pair , and the energy and @xmath53 distributions of the bottom quark are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mii_up_h_800 ] . here",
    "again the picture is similar to the previous case with possibility of large deviations from the sm case even in the case of small pseudoscalar admixtures .",
    "clearly , in the case of model ii , even for small pseudoscalar component of the higgs boson , there can be significant deviation in distributions from their sm values .",
    "while the analysis of the higgs decay does not bring out any new features in the simple considerations of the distributions , it should be possible to construct specific observables which violate cp symmetry with the help of these final state particles , and could be the topic of a future study .",
    "in this work motivated by the observation of new scalar resonance@xcite at lhc , we discussed the implications of indefinite cp properties of newly observed state at proposed linear collider ilc@xcite .",
    "ilc is a next generation @xmath59 collider machine which apart from searching beyond standard model physics , promise to precisely determine the properties of various sm fields including higgs at an unprecedented accuracy level which are beyond the realm of currently running lhc .",
    "+ here we thoroughly investigated the process @xmath60 with higgs field @xmath1 in an indefinite cp state .",
    "in general , cp properties of higgs yukawa couplings can be parameterized in terms of its cp - even(denoted by @xmath17 ) and cp - odd(@xmath16 ) components along with its gauge couplings parametrized by multiplicative factor @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters obey certain constrained relations(@xmath61 , @xmath33 ) in simplistic scenario , while they can vary much more freely in models like mssm or 2hdm for non supersymmetric case . in this work by categorizing these two scenarios as model i and model ii for constrained and unconstrained cases , respectively , we studied their implications on various detector level observables . here",
    "we incorporated the decays of the produced particles .",
    "thus our observables are not only sensitive to indefinite cp parameters at production level but also to the ones which appears at subsequent decay vertex .",
    "+ compared to earlier model independent studies on this topic , we have considered the decay distributions of the top quark as well as the higgs boson to analyse the couplings , and therefore the cp nature of the higgs boson under some realistic scenarios .",
    "such analysis of the spin and parity of the decaying particles does not require a reconstruction of their polarizations .",
    "we have demonstrated that results based on the study of simplified case of model i can differ drastically in a more realistic case like 2hdm of model ii .",
    "while the former require large pseudoscalar admixture in the higgs boson , and thus large cp violation in the higgs sector , the latter can produce significant deviation from the sm case even with 10% or smaller fraction of pseudoscalar component in the higgs boson .",
    "thus , we conclude that the indefinite cp properties of the higgs as a window to physics beyond the sm can be probed effectively through the process considered here",
