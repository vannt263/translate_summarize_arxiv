    "given an open set @xmath6 with finite measure , its dirichlet - laplacian spectrum is given by the numbers @xmath7 such that the boundary value problem @xmath8 has non trivial solutions .",
    "such numbers @xmath9 are called _ eigenvalues of the dirichlet - laplacian in @xmath10 _ , and form a discrete increasing sequence @xmath11 , diverging to @xmath12 ( see  @xcite , for example ) . in this paper",
    ", we will work with the first two eigenvalues @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for which we briefly recall the variational characterization : introducing the _ rayleigh quotient _ as @xmath15 the first two eigenvalues of the dirichlet - laplacian satisfy @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a first eigenfunction .",
    "we are concerned about the _",
    "attainable set _ of the first two eigenvalues @xmath13 and @xmath14 , that is , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume of the ball of unit radius in @xmath20 .",
    "of course , the set @xmath21 depends on the dimension @xmath22 of the ambient space .",
    "the set @xmath21 has been deeply studied ( see for instance  @xcite ) ; an approximate plot is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "let us recall now some of the most important known facts . in what follows",
    ", we will always denote by @xmath23 a ball of unit radius ( then , of volume @xmath19 ) , and by @xmath24 a disjoint union of two balls of volume @xmath25 .",
    "the attainable set @xmath21 has the following properties :    1 .   for every @xmath26 and every @xmath27 , one has @xmath28 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath29 3 .",
    "@xmath21 is _ horizontally _ and _ vertically convex _ , i.e. , for every @xmath30 @xmath31    the first property is a simple consequence of the scaling property @xmath32 , valid for any open set @xmath2 and any @xmath33 .",
    "the second property is true because , for every open set @xmath10 of unit measure , the faber ",
    "krahn inequality ensures @xmath34 , the krahn  szego inequality ( see  @xcite ) ensures @xmath35 , and a celebrated result by ashbaugh and benguria ( see  @xcite ) ensures @xmath36 finally , the third property is proven in  @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured also that the set @xmath21 is convex , as it seems reasonable by a numerical plot , but a proof for this fact is still not known .",
    "thanks to the above listed properties , the set @xmath21 is completely known once one knows its `` lower boundary '' @xmath37 therefore studying @xmath21 is equivalent to study @xmath38 .",
    "notice in particular that @xmath4 consists of the union of @xmath38 with the two half - lines @xmath39 let us call for brevity @xmath40 and @xmath41 the endpoints of @xmath38 , that is , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the plot of the set @xmath21 seems to suggest that the curve @xmath38 reaches the point @xmath41 with vertical tangent , and the point @xmath40 with horizontal tangent .",
    "in fact , wolf and keller in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) proved the first fact , and they also suggested that the second fact should be true , providing a numerical evidence .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give a short proof of this fact .    for every dimension @xmath44 , the curve @xmath38 reaches the point @xmath40 with horizontal tangent .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to prove this result : the proof will be achieved by exhibiting a suitable family @xmath45 of deformations of @xmath24 having measure @xmath19 and such that @xmath46",
    "throughout this section , for any given @xmath47 , we will write @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    we will make use of the sets @xmath51 , shown in figure  [ fig : omeps ] , defined by @xmath52 for every @xmath53 sufficiently small .",
    "the sets @xmath54 for which we will eventually prove  ( [ gothere ] ) will be rescaled copies of @xmath55 , in order to have measure @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the ball of unit radius centered at @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 and in particular @xmath64 .",
    "let also @xmath65 be a first dirichlet eigenfunction of @xmath61 with unit @xmath66 norm , and denote by @xmath67 the region ( shaded in figure  [ lastest ] ) bounded by the right circular conical surface @xmath68 and by the plane @xmath69 .    since the normal derivative of @xmath65 is constantly @xmath70 on @xmath71 , we know that @xmath72 let us now define the function @xmath73 as @xmath74 it is immediate to observe that @xmath75 on the surface @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 . notice that @xmath78 since @xmath79 does not vanish on @xmath80 . by construction and recalling  ( [ sim1 ] ) , @xmath81 since @xmath82 on @xmath83 , and recalling that @xmath84 , one clearly has @xmath85 since the small region @xmath86 has volume @xmath87 , and on this region @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , by  ( [ squa1 ] ) and  ( [ squa2 ] ) we obtain @xmath93 we can finally extend @xmath79 to the whole @xmath55 , simply defining @xmath94 on @xmath95 . by construction , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 so that  ( [ seconda ] ) follows and the proof is concluded .",
    "first of all , we start underlining that @xmath100 in fact if we define@xmath101 then by construction it readily follows that @xmath102 . as a consequance @xmath103 is",
    "an eigenvalue of @xmath55 , say @xmath104 . since @xmath55 is connected and @xmath79 changes sign , it is not possible @xmath105 , hence @xmath106 it is then enough for us to estimate @xmath103 . to this aim , define the set @xmath107 and take a lipschitz cut - off function @xmath108 such that @xmath109 as in lemma  [ upper1 ] , let again @xmath65 be a first eigenfunction of the ball @xmath61 of radius @xmath110 centered at @xmath62 having unit @xmath66 norm , and define on @xmath55 the function @xmath111 .",
