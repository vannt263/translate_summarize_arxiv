    "recent x - ray observations report that not only stellar black hole candidates ( sbhcs ) in their low states ( = faint sources ) , but also nls1s and stellar sljss ( = bright sources ) exhibit x - ray fluctuations ( variability ) .",
    "the fluctuations of bright sources are made in the optically thick adad , what we call sd ( = bright disk ) .",
    "however , the time evolution of the sd has not been investigated so far .",
    "the numerical simulation by manmoto et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) is well known as a time - evolution calculation of the optically thin adad ( = faint disk ) .",
    "the disturbance added into the optically thin adad falls into the central star .",
    "the disk luminosity increases when the disturbance falls , and the light curve of this process is in good agreement with the x - ray shot configuration of the sbhc cyg x-1 in its low state .",
    "i investigate how the luminosities of disturbed sds vary .",
    "i add a similar disturbance as manmoto et  al .",

    "the response of sds to local disturbances has been examined by one - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "it is generally believed that sds are thermally stable .",

    "after the disturbance has damped , the global disk structure of the disk is not greatly modified .",
    "this can account for the persistent x - ray emission with substantial variations observed in nls1s and sljss .",
    "when a perturbation is made in the sd , it decays and exhibits one x - ray shot . since the structure of the sd does not globally vary much after a perturbation propagates , the next perturbation produced in the disk can also exhibit an x - ray shot . repeating such processes continuously can make the substantial variability seen in the x - ray luminosities of sljss and nls1s"
