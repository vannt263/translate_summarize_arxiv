    "scalar - tensor ( st ) gravity theories constitute one of the main sources of extensions to general relativity ( gr ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "they constitute a class of theories with well posed actions where the gravitational fields are given by both the metric and a scalar field .",
    "diverse physical motivations for gr extensions naturally lead to st actions @xcite . on the other hand , currently there is no solid observational or experimental evidence that clearly favours a st model over gr .",
    "this has lead to considerations on mechanisms that could somehow hide the non - observed scalar field effects in the solar system , while allowing it to develop a nontrivial role at different scales , say at the cosmological level . such mechanisms , which change the effective number of degrees of freedom of gravity , by hiding the scalar field at appropriate scales , have received considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "external fields appear in diverse contexts in physics .",
    "in particular , an external field is sometimes defined as a field whose expression as a spacetime function is known beforehand .",
    "thence the role of the field equations is to provide solutions to the other ( non - external ) fields . from the action perspective ,",
    "an external field is a quantity that should not be varied , since it is already known .",
    "for instance , the minkowski metric in the context of electromagnetism in flat spacetime is an external rank two field . in this case",
    "the spacetime geometry is fixed beforehand and one uses the field equations , which are derived from variations with respect to other fields , in order to derive electromagnetic configurations that are compatible with such geometry .",
    "it is not a novelty that external fields are used as part of the framework of gravity theories .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the authors , based on renormalization group expectations , argue in favor of a gravitational action with two external scalar fields ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is a natural starting point since the dynamics of these two fields , in this context , should not be inferred from pure classical field equations , the renormalization group equations together with certain ansatz are used to partially fix the dynamics of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( for recent developments see @xcite ) .",
    "another proposal that uses external fields is that of massive gravity in arbitrary backgrounds .",
    "the latter is equivalent to bigravity in the limit in which the coupling constant of one of the rank-2 tensors goes to infinity ( see e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "these actions contain a usual rank-2 tensor together with an additional one that has external character , that is the full field equations do not consider an equation coming from the action variation with respect to the external tensor ( which may or may not describe a minkowski spacetime geometry ) .",
    "we also cite the case of unimodular gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in unimodular gravity , when formulated as in @xcite , there is no field that is fully external , but the determinant of the metric behaves as an external field .",
    "that is , the metric has the same role as in the einstein - hilbert action , except that its determinant has a fixed value .",
    "its action can also be recast by using a lagrange multiplier such that the metric is fully non - external , but a condition is imposed between the metric determinant and an _ external _ scalar density field @xcite . as a last example , the more recently proposed approach to modify gravity inspired on continuous mechanics @xcite , is closely related to the approach developed here . in ref .",
    "@xcite an external tensor ( which is not a metric ) is also used .",
    "contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite , our emphasis here will be on an external scalar and the comparison between the frameworks of gr and st gravity to est gravity , that is , a st gravity whose scalar is an external field .    in order to be clear , the definition that is here used for an external field is the following : it is a field whose variation inside the action should not be considered in the process of deriving the field equations .",
    "hence , for a fixed number of fields , the higher is the number of external fields , the lower is the number of field equations derived from the action .",
    "the main concern in this work is precisely to look for est solutions that are different from both gr and st solutions .",
    "it turns out that est theories allow a different way of recovering gr behaviour in some spacetime regions .",
    "the transition between gr to non - gr behaviour depends on the boundary conditions associated with the system .",
    "this work is organised as follows : section [ sec2 ] is devoted both to the introduction of est gravity and to address general differences and similarities to st gravity and gr . a particular cosmological solution that exhibits both a gr phase and a st one ( but that is globally neither a gr nor a st solution ) is proposed in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present our conclusions and in appendices [ appa ] , [ appb ] , [ appc ] we present respectively issues on the stress - energy conservation related with external fields , additional details on the proposed particular solution and an extension of the latter for barotropic fluids .",
    "a mechanical example on the use of external variables is presented in appendix [ appmec ] , and appendix [ appe ] shows a first test using sn data .",
    "commonly used abbreviations : bd = brans - dicke , est = scalar - tensor with an external scalar field , gr = general relativity , rw = robertson - walker , st = scalar - tensor .",

    "it looks as the usual st action , but the difference ( at the action level ) is that the scalar field @xmath2 is not to be varied , since it is external ( as defined in the introduction ) . for this reason , the action dependence in @xmath2 does not explicitly enter the notation @xmath5 $ ] .",

( [ ext scalar field eq ] ) leads to the usual st equation @xmath17the above equation is precisely the same equation that is derived from the action ( [ st action ] ) variation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "it then should be clear that the equation set ( [ einstein st ] ) , ( [ stress conservation ] ) and ( [ usual scalar eq ] ) composes the usual st fundamental field equations @xcite , while the equation set ( [ einstein st ] ) and ( [ stress conservation ] ) composes the est fundamental field equations ( from which ( [ ext scalar field eq ] ) , that is less constraining than ( [ usual scalar eq ] ) , is just a logical consequence ) .",
    "let us also stress that , in the usual st case , the contracted bianchi identity just results in a triviality , since equation ( [ usual scalar eq ] ) is already known as a fundamental field equation .",
    "on the other hand , in the est case , the contracted bianchi identity leads to equation ( [ ext scalar field eq ] ) , that is worth to be considered , since it does not appear explicitly ( while it is implicitly present ) in the set of fundamental field equations .",
    "therefore , the est action ( [ st action ] ) , together with the assumption that @xmath18 everywhere , is equivalent to a st theory , since in this case , the field equations solutions are the same of the usual st ( provided that the boundary conditions and the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the same ) .",
    "thence , the solutions of st theory are particular solutions of the corresponding est theory . however , ( [ ext scalar field eq ] ) differs from the usual scalar equation by the scalar field gradient present as an overall factor . as a consequence , independently on the @xmath19 and @xmath20 functions , ( [ ext scalar field eq ] ) also admits solutions such that @xmath21reinserting in ( [ einstein st ] )",
    ", it immediately results that the est field equation ( [ einstein st ] ) becomes identical to gr field equation , with the newton s constant @xmath0 numerically given by @xmath22 .",
    "thence , gr solutions also generate est solutions with the same stress tensor , the est metric being the gr s one and the scalar field being @xmath23 , where @xmath24  is newton s constant .    to be complete",
    ", it could be worth identifying the cases where est gravity reduces to the usual st case .",
    "the difference between the two theories just results from the presence of @xmath15 as an overall factor in ( [ ext scalar field eq ] ) .",
    "thence , the reduction to usual st occurs if , and only if , the solutions of @xmath25 also solve eq .",
    "( [ usual scalar eq ] ) .",

    "hence , in particular , vacuum solutions of est gravity with @xmath31 are always st gravity solutions .",
    "for instance , in this case , the propagation of gravitational waves in vacuum obeys the same equations in both theories .",
    "another issue to be stressed is ( and this is the main point of this paper ) is that the set of est solutions is larger than the set of the corresponding st or gr solutions .",
    "indeed , one can also derive est solutions by matching parts of usual st solutions to parts of gr solutions , if the relevant conditions are satisfied .",
    "these conditions ensure that the est field equations are valid at all the spacetime points ( this will be exemplified in the next section ) .",

    "let us remark that , in an est solution that contains two disjoint spacetime regions where @xmath25 , the solutions in these regions satisfy the gr equation , but in general with different numerical values for the newtonian constant .",
