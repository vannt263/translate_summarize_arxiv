    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the prime candidates for physics beyond the standard model at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "low energy phenomenology of weak scale susy is determined mostly by the soft susy breaking terms of the visible gauge and matter superfields .",
    "those soft terms are required to preserve flavor and cp with a good accuracy , which severely constrains the possible mediation mechanism of susy breaking",
    ". presently , there are three known mediation schemes to yield flavor and cp conserving soft terms and @xmath0 parameters , which should be considered separately . ] : gauge mediation @xcite , anomaly mediation @xcite , and string dilaton or volume - moduli mediation @xcite . in gauge and anomaly mediations , the radiative corrections due to the standard model ( sm ) gauge interaction play dominant role for the mediation , and thereby the resulting soft terms automatically preserve flavor and cp . for dilaton / moduli mediation , soft terms induced by the dilaton / moduli @xmath1-components preserve flavor and cp by different reasons .",
    "the couplings between the messenger dilaton / moduli and the mssm matter fields preserve flavor as they are determined by family - universal rational numbers called the modular weight @xcite , and preserve cp as a consequence of the associated axionic shift symmetries @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies of susy phenomenology have been focused on the cases that susy breaking is dominated by one of the dilaton / moduli , gauge and anomaly mediations .",
    "however , recent progress in moduli stabilization suggests that it is a rather plausible possibility that moduli mediation and anomaly mediation are comparable to each other @xcite , which can be naturally realized in kklt - type moduli stabilization scenario @xcite .",
    "the resulting soft terms show a distinct feature that sparticle masses are unified at a mirage messenger scale hierarchically lower than the scale of gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "also a mixed scheme of anomaly and gauge mediations has been proposed before as a solution to the tachyonic slepton problem of anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that these schemes can be generalized to include the three known flavor and cp conserving mediations altogether @xcite .",
    "such a most general mixed mediation has been dubbed ` deflected mirage mediation ' as sfermion masses are deflected from the mirage unification trajectory due to the presence of gauge mediation .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to examine in more detail the sparticle mass pattern in deflected mirage mediation scenario , together with some phenomenological aspects of the scheme .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss a class of string - motivated effective supergravity models that realize deflected mirage mediation scenario . in section iii , we analyze the renormalization group running of soft parameters to derive the ( approximate ) analytic expression of low energy sparticle masses in deflected mirage mediation , which can be used to interpret the experimentally measured sparticle masses within the framework of the most general flavor and cp conserving mediation scheme .",
    "we discuss in section iv the phenomenological feature of two specific examples , one with an accidental little hierarchy between @xmath2 and other soft mass - squares and another with gluino nlsp , that can be obtained within deflected mirage mediation scenario .",
    "section v is the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we discuss a class of 4-dimensional ( 4d ) n=1 supergravity ( sugra ) models that realize the deflected mirage mediation scenario .",
    "the models discussed here may arise as a low energy effective theory of kklt - type flux compactification or its variants in string theory .",
    "the model contains first of all the mssm gauge and matter superfields , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and also vector - like mssm - charged exotic matter superfields , @xmath5 , which live on the visible sector brane .",
    "there are light moduli @xmath6 , e.g. the khler moduli , stabilized by non - perturbative effects encoded in the superpotential , and also heavy moduli @xmath7 stabilized by flux , e.g. the complex structure moduli .",
    "typically @xmath8 corresponds to an axion - like field , and thus the couplings of @xmath6 are invariant under the axionic shift symmetry : [ axionicshift ] u(1)_t_i : t_it_i + , upon ignoring exponentially small non - perturbative effects .    in kklt - type compactification , moduli stabilization dynamics itself does not break susy since the flux and non - perturbative effects stabilize moduli at a supersymmetric ads vacuum .",
    "thus , to break susy and lift the vacuum to ds state , one needs to introduce a susy breaking brane separately .",
    "this susy breaking brane might be an anti - brane that exists in the underlying string theory , or a brane carrying a 4d dynamics that breaks susy spontaneously .",
    "an important feature of kklt - type compactification is that it involves a highly warped throat produced by flux . in the presence of such a warped throat ,",
    "susy breaking brane is stabilized at the tip of throat where the potential of the position modulus is minimized . on the other hand , to implement the high scale gauge coupling unification in the mssm , the visible sector brane should be stabilized within the internal space at the uv end of throat .",
    "this results in a warped separation between the visible brane and the susy breaking brane , making the visible sector and the susy breaking sector to be sequestered from each other @xcite . to be specific , here we will consider a susy braking sector described by a polony - like superfield @xmath9 having a linear superpotential .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the visible sector soft terms which are of our major concern are independent of how susy is broken at the tip of throat , and therefore our subsequent discussion is valid in cases that susy is broken by other means , e.g. by an anti - brane @xcite .      with the above features of kklt - type compactification",

    "as for the stabilization of @xmath13 , one can consider two scenarios .",
    "the first scenario is that @xmath13 is stabilized by the combined effects of the susy breaking by @xmath32 and the non - renormalizable operator @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath35 , and @xmath13 is stabilized by the radiative correction to its khler potential .",

    "polony&=&zz^*- , + w_polony&=&m_susy^2z , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the two mass parameters for susy - breaking dynamics .",
    "generically , some moduli may have a non - negligible wavefunction value at the tip of throat .",
    "then those moduli can have a sizable contact interaction with @xmath9 , which means that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as well as the coefficient of @xmath40 in @xmath41 , become a nontrivial function of moduli .",
    "however , such an additional complexity does not affect our subsequent discussion , and thus here we consider the simple case that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are moduli - independent constants . at any rate , with the above form of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ,",
    "the vacuum value of @xmath43 is determined as z =- m_susy^2 ^ 2 , where @xmath44 is the scalar component of the compensator superfield @xmath14 .",

    "both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are red - shifted by an exponentially small warp factor at the tip of throat : m_susy~m _ * ~ e^-a m_pl , where .g_|_tip = e^-2a _ .",
    "the flux - induced superpotential of @xmath7 can be expanded around its stationary point : w_flux(u_p)&= & w_flux(_p)+ ( u_p-_p)(u_q-_q)+ + & & w_0+(m_u)_pq ( u_p-_p)(u_q-_q)+ , where @xmath47 denotes the stationary point of @xmath48 : .|_u_q=_q=0 . due to the quantization of flux , for generic flux configuration ,",
    "both @xmath49 and @xmath50 would be of order unity in the unit with @xmath16 .",

    "still the flux - induced moduli mass matrix @xmath50 generically has the eigenvalues of order unity .",

    "this radiative correction is controlled by the average stop mass , @xmath223 , m_h_u^2 ~- y_t^2 m_^2 ( ) , therefore , barring fine - tuning of the initial condition , we anticipate @xmath224 for @xmath222 hierarchically larger than @xmath225 . on the other hand ,",

    "( note that in the previous section @xmath66 has been used to parameterize the renormalization point of running soft parameters . )",
    "this means that we are forced to fine - tune the parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath230 at less than @xmath231% level to obtain the observed size of @xmath232 , despite these two parameters are expected to be not correlated .",
    "this not fatal but uncomfortable fine - tuning in the mssm arising from the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the susy breaking mass scale is called ` the little susy hierarchy problem ' @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     phenomenology of the gluino lsp or meta - stable gluino has been investigated from various motivations @xcite , particularly in the context of split supersymmetry recently @xcite . most of the analyses can be directly applied to our case .",
    "we summarize some of the results below .",
    "since squarks are somewhat heavier than gluino in the present scenario , gluino is mainly produced via the processes , @xmath233 or @xmath234 at the hadron collider such as tevatron and lhc . while at the lepton collider it is always produced in association with quarks , @xmath235 since the leptons are color singlets .",

    "phenomenologically , the most relevant question is the stability of the charged particles which leave tracks in the detector .",
    "it depends on the identity of the lightest r - hadron and their mass differences",
    ". the mass spectrum of r - hadron is estimated by the mit bag model @xcite and the quenched lattice simulation @xcite which predict iso - triplet vector r - meson and r - gluon ( @xmath239 ) as the lightest r - hadron , respectively . in both cases",
    "their mass difference is smaller than the pion mass .",
    "thus the vector r - meson is stable against hadronic decay .",
    "the mass difference of the lightest r - baryon and the ground state of r - gluon or r - meson is also estimated to be smaller than the nucleon mass and the r - baryon is stable @xcite .",
    "therefore the probability for gluino to hadronize into the charged states , @xmath240 is expected to be non - negligible , although the reliability of such a conclusion is limited by those of the calculation method and adopted assumptions .    inside the detector the r - hadron deposits energy via hadronic interaction with nucleus and , if it is charged , ionization of the detector material .",
    "the gluino is typically produced with momentum similar order of its mass ( @xmath241 ) and thus the r - hadron is relativistic but slow , @xmath242 .",
    "the energy involved in the hadronic interaction is approximated by @xmath243 with @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "therefore the interaction is soft nevertheless the energy carried by the r - hadron is huge ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "then the neutral r - hadron traverses the detector repeatedly kicking off the nucleon inside the nucleus and the soft secondary particles dissipating a small fraction of its kinetic energy at each collision .",
    "eventually it penetrates the detector carrying away significant amount of missing energy .",
    "this behavior is in contrast to the ordinary hadron which develops shower and exponentially dumps its energy in the calorimeter .",

    ", @xmath246 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath247 while the average hadronic energy loss per collision behaves like @xmath248 , the ionization plays a minor role for large @xmath144 ( @xmath249 ) , however , it quickly dominates over the hadronic interaction as the r - hadron is slowed down @xcite .",
    "the heavily ionizing track provides a characteristic signal of the slowly moving charged r - hadron .",
    "it is noted that even if the r - hadron is neutral it can change its identity in the hadronic interaction .",
    "if the neutral and charged states are both stable , it transforms from neutral to charged and vice versa along with its path ( flipper scenario ) .",
    "based on the careful inference about the nature of r - hadron as explained above , the pioneering work by @xcite excluded the gluino mass range ,",
    "@xmath250 at @xmath251% cl almost independent of @xmath240 using jet+@xmath252 channel in lep and tevatron cdf run i , while @xmath253 for @xmath254 by a heavily - ionizing track search in tevatron cdf .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis in @xcite emphasized a model independent role of the high @xmath255 monojet which is produced in association with the gluino pair .",
    "they obtained a conservative bound , @xmath256 , independent of @xmath240 using the tevatron run i data and projected it to @xmath257 for run ii and @xmath258 for lhc .",
    "they also estimated a reach of the charged track search ( @xmath259 ) as @xmath260 for cdf run i with integrated luminosity @xmath261 , @xmath262 for run ii with @xmath263 and @xmath264 for lhc with @xmath265 .",
    "more serious study on the r - hadron discovery potential in lhc atlas detector has been performed using the atlas fast simulation framework @xcite .",
    "they have taken into account the flipper behavior of the r - hadron and perform monte carlo simulation based on geant3 . using event selection with global event variables such as the missing transverse energy @xmath266 , the total sum of the transverse energy @xmath267 and the transverse momentum ( @xmath255 ) measured in the muon chamber",
    ", they concluded that the r - hadron is discovered for the mass up to @xmath268 with the integrated luminosity @xmath269 . while the reach extends to @xmath270 if the time - of - flight information for slow - moving r - hadron between the muon chambers is used in the event selection in stead of @xmath266 and @xmath267 . from these studies",
    "we can conclude that still the gluino lsp scenario of our interest has a considerable portion of parameter space , however , it will be fully examined in the relatively early stage of lhc .",
    "the stable r - hadron in cosmological time scale having electric or hadronic interaction will conflict with various phenomenological constraints such as heavy isotope searches @xcite unless the relic abundance is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "an alternative interesting possibility is that the gluino is unstable but decays outside of the detector as in the split supersymmetry , which circumvents the cosmological difficulty but will not change the collider signature we have discussed above .",
    "a concrete example is given by the axionic extension of deflected mirage mediation as discussed in @xcite .",
    "because of the recursive nature of the mass spectrum of deflected mirage mediation with multi - thresholds , we can introduce the axion superfield @xmath271 stabilized by the khler potential in addition to @xmath13 without disturbing the low energy mass spectrum as long as @xmath272 .",
    "the lsp is now axino , @xmath273 whose mass is one - loop suppressed relative to the gauginos since there is no tree - level contribution from the superpotential .",
    "the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is gluino , which decays to the axino via @xmath274-dependence in the gauge coupling constant introduced by the threshold correction .",
    "the corresponding interaction lagrangian is given by @xcite _",
    "g & = & |_5 ^ g _ + h.c . , which yields the decay width ( g ) & & , and the life time [ eq : gluino - decay ] _ & = & ( g)^-1 5.710 ^ -7sec ( ) ^-3 ( ) ^2 n_^-2 , where @xmath140 is the number of messengers coupling with the axion .",
    "for @xmath275 and @xmath276 , most of the decay occurs outside of the detector and the discovery prospects discussed above is applicable . on the other hand , for @xmath277 or @xmath278 , gluinos decay inside the detector , which results in a displaced jet vertex with missing energy . it would provide a clear signature and a similar experimental reach as in the case of the heavily ionizing track , although a detailed study in a realistic circumstance is mandatory for deriving any definitive conclusion .",
    "the relic axino abundance in deflected mirage mediation with the gluino nlsp can be estimated by following the discussion in @xcite . as is well known , if we have a light modulus @xmath279 as in ( deflected ) mirage mediation , its coherent oscillation dominates the energy density of the universe after the inflation @xcite .",
    "eventually it decays and produced entropy dilutes everything existed before .",
    "the saxion also oscillates , but it is harmless as long as @xmath280 since it decays faster than the modulus . the reheating temperature of the modulus is estimated as @xcite t_r & = & ( ) ^1/4 0.15 gev ( ) ^-1/4 ( ) ^3/2 d_g , where @xmath281 denotes the effective bosonic degrees of freedom at @xmath282 for the energy density and @xmath283 is a model dependent parameter of order unity defined as @xmath284 .",
    "it is marginally smaller than the thermal decoupling temperature of gluino @xcite t_f & = & m_/x_f 6 gev ( ) .",
    "therefore the thermal relic abundance of gluino is not suitable to calculate the axino abundance .",
    "actually , the dominant contribution to the axino relic abundance comes from the gravitino which is produced by the decay of the modulus @xcite .",
    "the gravitino decay eventually produces at least one gluino ( or axino ) and hence one axino . the gravitino yield which is conserved in the adiabatic expansion of the universe",
    "is given by @xcite [ eq : gravitino - yield ] y_3/2 & & b_3/2^t ~4.3 10 ^ -9 ( ) ^-1/4 ( ) ^1/2 d_g .",
    "the gluino decay to axino potentially competes with the gluino annihilation . the perturbative annihilation cross section in the zero relative velocity limit ( @xmath285 )",
    "is given by @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "then the inverse of annihilation rate is estimated as _",
    "ann^-1 & & ( n_3/2 _ ann ) ^-1",
    "( y_3/2 s(t_3/2 ) _ ann)^-1",
    "+ & & 1.6 10 ^ -5 sec ( ) ^-1/2 ( ) ^-9/2 ( ) ^2 d_g^-1 , which is considerably larger than ( [ eq : gluino - decay ] ) .",
    "thus the annihilation is negligible and ( [ eq : gravitino - yield ] ) gives a good estimation of the axino yield .",
    "then the current axino density is given by _",
    "h^2 & = & 1.2 ( ) ( ) ^-1/4 ( ) ^1/2 d_g , where @xmath287 and @xmath288 are the entropy density and hubble constant of the current universe , respectively .",
    "thus the axino , which has one - loop suppressed mass relative to the gaugino ( @xmath289 ) , accompanied with the gluino nlsp can naturally saturate the observed dark matter density as discussed in @xcite for other nlsps .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the sparticle mass pattern in deflected mirage mediation scenario of supersymmetry breaking , in which all of the three known flavor conserving mediations , i.e. dilaton / moduli , anomaly and gauge mediations , contribute to the mssm soft parameters .",
    "starting with a class of string - motivated effective supergravity models that realize deflected mirage mediation , we analyzed the renormalization group running of soft parameters to derive the ( approximate ) analytic expression of low energy sparticle masses at the tev scale .",
    "we also discussed more detailed phenomenology of two specific examples , one with an accidental little hierarchy between @xmath2 and other soft mass - squares and another with gluino nlsp , that can be obtained within deflected mirage mediation scenario .",
    "if some sparticles masses are in the sub - tev range , the corresponding sparticles can be copiously produced at the cern lhc , and then one may be able to measure their masses with the methods proposed in @xcite .",
    "our results then can be used to interpret the experimentally measured sparticle masses within the framework of the most general flavor and cp conserving mediation scheme .",
