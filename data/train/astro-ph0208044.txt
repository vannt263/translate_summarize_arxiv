    "ss  433 is still one of the most mysterious of the x - ray binaries even after some 25 years of observation @xcite . we know that the mass donor feeds an enlarged accretion disk surrounding a neutron star or black hole companion , and a small portion of this inflow is ejected into relativistic jets that are observed in optical and x - ray emission lines and in high resolution radio maps",
    "there are two basic timescales that control the spectral appearance and system dynamics , a 162  d disk and jet precessional cycle and a 13  d orbital period .",
    "the mass function derived from the @xmath3 emission line indicates that the donor star mass is in excess of @xmath4 @xcite , and the donor is probably a roche - filling , evolved star @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral signature of this star has eluded detection .",
    "this is probably because the binary is embedded in an expanding thick disk that is fed by the wind from the super - eddington accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the outer regions of this equatorial thick disk have been detected in high resolution radio measurements by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recently showed how many of the properties of the `` stationary '' emission lines can be explained in terms of a disk wind @xcite .",
    "the task of finding the spectrum of the donor is crucial because without a measurement of its orbital motion , the mass of the relativistic star is unknown .",
    "the best opportunity to observe the flux from the donor occurs at the precessional phase when the disk normal is closest to our line of sight and the donor star appears well above the disk plane near the donor inferior conjunction orbital phase @xcite .",
    "this configuration occurs only a few nights each year for ground - based observers .",
    "the choice of spectral region is also important .",
    "@xcite found that the regular eclipse and precessional variations seen clearly in the blue are lost in the red due to an erratically variable flux component .",
    "thus , we need to search for the donor spectrum blueward of the @xmath5-band in order to avoid this variable component . on the other hand ,",
    "the color variations observed during eclipses suggest that the donor is cooler than the central portions of the disk @xcite .",
    "thus , the disk will tend to contribute a greater fraction of the total flux at lower wavelengths .",
    "the best compromise is in the blue where there are a number of strong absorption lines in b- and later - type stars .    here",
    "we present the results of a blue spectral search for the donor s spectrum made during an optimal disk and orbital configuration in 2002 june (  2 ) .",
    "we first discuss the dominant emission features formed in the jets and disk wind (  3 ) .",
    "we then focus on a much weaker set of absorption lines (  4 ) , and we present arguments linking these to the photosphere of the donor star .",
    "the blue spectra of ss  433 were obtained on three consecutive nights , 2002 june 5  7 , with the large cassegrain spectrograph ( lcs ) on the 2.7-m harlan j.  smith telescope at the university of texas mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "these dates correspond to precessional phases between @xmath6 and 0.011 ( where @xmath7 corresponds to the time when the jets are closest to our line of sight and their emission lines attain their extremum radial velocities ) and to orbital phases between @xmath8 and 0.178 ( where mid - eclipse and donor inferior conjunction occur at @xmath9 ) according to the phase relations adopted in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were made in first order with the # 46 grating ( 1200 grooves mm@xmath10 , blazed at 4000  ) , and they cover the wavelength range between 4060 and 4750  .",
    "we used a long slit configuration with a slit width of @xmath11 , which corresponds to a projected width of 2 pixels fwhm on the detector , a @xmath12 format ti ccd with 15@xmath13 m square pixels .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion is 0.889   pixel@xmath10 and the spectral resolving power is @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , the weather was partially cloudy throughout the run , and we were only able to obtain a few consecutive , 20 minute exposures on each night .",
    "we also obtained a full suite of calibration bias , dome flat field , and argon comparison frames throughout the run .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in iraf .",
    "we co - added all the consecutive spectra from a given night to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the co - added spectra were then rectified to a unit continuum by the fitting of line - free regions .",
    "note that this rectification process arbitrarily removes the continuum flux variations that occurred in ss  433 during the eclipse .",
    "all the spectra were then transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid for ease of comparison .",
    "the final s / n ratios in the continuum at the long - wavelength end of the spectra are 31 , 16 , and 40 pixel@xmath10 for the three consecutive nights , respectively .",
    "our three spectra are shown in chronological sequence in figure  1 .",
    "this part of the spectrum is dominated by the familiar strong emission lines of h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "most of these lines appear stronger in the first , mid - eclipse spectrum made when the continuum flux was low .",
    "we begin by examining the radial velocity and intensity variations of the emission lines before turning to the weaker absorption features in the next section .",
    "the only strong jet emission feature in this spectral range at this time is the blueshifted h@xmath17 line ( formed in the approaching jet ) , which is found just longward of h@xmath16 .",
    "this spectral range should also contain redshifted jet components from the upper balmer sequence ( from the balmer limit at @xmath18   to h@xmath19 at @xmath20  ) , but , if present , they are too weak to detect in our spectra .",
    "we measured the radial velocity of the h@xmath17 emission feature by fitting a single gaussian in each case .",
    "these measurements are partially compromised by the appearance of multiple sub - peaks in some cases ( see the final profile that contains a redshifted , sub - peak corresponding in radial velocity to the `` bullet '' that appeared on the previous night ) and by the possible existence of very weak @xmath21 emission .",
    "nevertheless , these measurements show the familiar oscillations in the jet velocities due to the tidal `` nodding '' of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "table  1 lists the heliocentric julian date for the mid - time of each observation , the observed h@xmath17 radial velocity as @xmath22 ( estimated errors @xmath23 ) , and the predicted @xmath24 value based upon the extrapolation of the fit to the h@xmath25 jet velocities observed between 1998 and 1999 @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the observed and predicted motions suggests that our jet precessional velocity fit is still reliable 3 years after the last h@xmath25 observations .",
    "the stationary emission lines generally fall into two categories : lines like @xmath3 that form in a region symmetric about the center of the accretion disk and that show orbital radial velocity curves of the form @xmath26 , and features like the hydrogen balmer lines that probably form in a large volume in the disk s wind and have a radial velocity variation of the form @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we measured the radial velocities of the stationary lines in our spectra to confirm their radial velocity behavior .",
    "the profiles were obtained by gaussian fitting in all cases except for the + complex near 4644  , where we measured relative shifts by cross - correlating the profiles for the second and third nights against that from the first night .",
    "our results are listed in table  2 ( errors are @xmath28 km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "all the lines showed the blueward motion expected in this phase interval , but with a larger amplitude than predicted .",
    "the largest decline was found in + and @xmath3 , which decreased in radial velocity by @xmath29 km  s@xmath10 over the duration of observations .",
    "@xcite estimate that the disk semiamplitude is @xmath30 km  s@xmath10 , much smaller than we observed .",
    "the same situation occurred in lines of the other group , h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , and @xmath31 which declined by some 108 km  s@xmath10 ( compared to the expected @xmath32 km  s@xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we speculate that this difference is due to the emergence of the approaching portion of the disk after the eclipse , which biases the radial velocities to more negative values .",
    "the other clue about the origin of the stationary lines comes from their intensity variations during the eclipse .",
    "if the emission source has a constant flux , then during eclipse the line will appear proportionally stronger relative to the lower continuum flux .",
    "however , if the emission source is also ( partially ) eclipsed , then the relative strength in rectified intensity remains approximately constant in eclipse .",
    "we show in table  3 the rectified intensities of the emission lines for the first two nights relative to that on the final night .",
    "the final column gives the predicted constant emission flux variation relative to the last night based upon the @xmath33-band light curve ( @xcite ; see their fig .",
    "7b ) and the @xmath34 color variations ( @xcite ; see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "we find that most of the line intensities decreased by a factor of @xmath35 between the first ( mid - eclipse ) and last ( out - of - eclipse ) observations , compared to an expected decrease of @xmath36 for a constant emission flux source .",
    "this difference is probably not significant since the intrinsic system flux does vary on short timescales , but the result does suggest that most of the lines form in regions large compared to the continuum - forming part of the accretion disk ( so that the continuum - forming inner disk is eclipsed while the much larger line forming region suffers only minor occultation ) .",
    "the main exception is the + line which varies little in rectified intensity and must therefore form co - spatially with the continuum in the inner , hot part of the accretion disk .",
    "the other possible exception is the @xmath3 line . @xcite and @xcite observed profile shape variations during the eclipse that we also find ( for example , from single- to double - peaked with egress from the eclipse ) , and they argue that the feature has two components , one formed in gas close to the disk center ( eclipsed ) and one formed in a larger volume ( not eclipsed ) .",
    "this assessment agrees with the fact that , after the + line , the @xmath3 feature shows the second smallest decrease in rectified flux , suggesting that its line forming region is more occulted during the eclipse than is the case for the h and lines ( formed in the larger disk wind ) .",
    "we were struck in comparing the individual spectra by the similarity of patterns of what might first be considered `` noise '' in the continuum between the strong emission lines .",
    "we formed a global average spectrum with each spectrum weighted by the square of its s / n ratio , and an expanded version of this average spectrum is shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "we show below the average ss  433 plot examples of stellar spectra that could correspond to the spectral type of the donor star .",
    "the two b - star spectra were obtained from the atlas of @xcite , and we obtained the spectrum of the a - supergiant , hd  148743 , with the lcs .",
    "all these spectra were gaussian smoothed to an effective 2 pixel resolution of 1.78   fwhm in order to compare them at the same instrumental resolution .",
    "we see that there is a significant ( and largely unresolved ) system of absorption lines in ss  433 that has eluded detection in earlier work .",
    "the line patterns bear little resemblance to those in b - supergiants but there are a number of features in common with the a - supergiant ( @xmath37  k ; @xcite ) .",
    "we show some preliminary identifications of the absorption lines based upon lists in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we measured the radial velocity of the absorption system by cross - correlating sub - sections of the spectrum containing the deepest features with the same in the first spectrum of the set .",
    "these relative velocities are listed in the final column of table  2 .",
    "( we found that the absorption lines in the first spectrum had a cross - correlation velocity of @xmath38 km  s@xmath10 compared to the rest frame spectrum of hd  148743 , so adding this value to the velocities in table  2 gives an estimate of the absolute velocities . ) unlike the emission lines , the absorption lines moved significantly redward during the run , as expected for the donor star .    direct inspection of figure  1 suggests that the absorption line spectrum grew fainter with egress from the eclipse , as predicted for the donor s spectrum .",
    "it is difficult to measure the change in individual lines , so we measured the strength of the cross - correlation of the absorption lines with those in hd  148743 .",
    "the relative cross - correlation intensities are listed in the second last column of table  3 ( errors of @xmath39 ) .",
    "the absorption depths weakened in the same way as the emission intensities , suggesting that both became diluted by the emerging flux of the disk .",
    "both the radial velocity and intensity variations indicate that the absorption lines form in the long - sought donor star . if they were formed in the interstellar medium ( the case of the absorptions at 4428 , 4501 , and 4726  ) , then we would observe no velocity or intensity variations through these eclipse phases .",
    "similar arguments rule out formation in an extended `` shell '' surrounding the binary system .",
    "the absorption line velocities are insufficient for a general orbital solution , but we can make a restricted solution if we assume that the orbit is circular and we adopt the orbital period and epoch of mid - eclipse from @xcite .",
    "then we can solve for two parameters , the systemic velocity , @xmath40 , and orbital semiamplitude , @xmath41 , from our 3 radial velocity measurements of the optical star .",
    "we used the orbital fitting code of @xcite to find @xmath42 km  s@xmath10 and @xmath43 km  s@xmath10 with residual errors of 9 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite find the semi - amplitude of the disk is @xmath44 km  s@xmath10 based upon the @xmath3 radial velocity curve .",
    "they adopt the system inclination from the `` kinematical '' model of the jets to arrive at a mass relation , @xmath45 where the mass ratio is @xmath46 .",
    "we can now combine the semiamplitudes to estimate the mass ratio , @xmath47 , and the resulting masses are @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the companion is a black hole .",
    "the absorption line depths strengthen from main sequence to supergiant in the a stars , and they appear sufficiently strong in the first eclipse spectrum to rule out a main sequence class .",
    "the donor star probably fills the critical roche surface , and our estimate of the mass ratio indicates a roche volume radius of @xmath50 , consistent with a supergiant class .",
    "thus , our results for ss  433 support the evolutionary scenario described by @xcite in which mass transfer is occurring on a thermal timescale as the donor crosses the hertzsprung gap .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude difference between the star and disk , @xmath51 , based upon the apparent line depths .",
    "suppose that during the central eclipse a disk flux of @xmath52 is occulted while a disk flux of @xmath53 and donor star flux @xmath54 remain visible .",
    "the stellar line depths will then appear diluted by a factor @xmath55 .",
    "the observed line depths during eclipse ( relative to the spectrum of the a - supergiant ) suggest that the dilution is minimal , so @xmath56 to 1 .",
    "based upon the line intensity variations we observed ( table  3 ) , the ratio of out - of - eclipse to mid - eclipse flux is @xmath57 , and thus , the disk to star flux ratio is @xmath58 to 2.8 ( or @xmath59 to 1.4 mag ) .",
    "a donor star this bright may appear to be in conflict with earlier results @xcite , but we suspect that the star is heavily obscured at other precessional and orbital phases so that the line spectrum is difficult to find ( and thus the estimate of the donor star s flux based on the absence of the lines will to be too low ) .    clearly our results should be regarded as preliminary since we have only observed the absorption spectrum during this one eclipse event , and ss  433 is known to display spectroscopic variations on timescales unrelated to the orbit .",
    "nevertheless , confirmation of our results ( especially in spectra of higher s / n and resolution ) would be of particular importance in determining the stellar parameters of the donor ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and abundance ) and in refining the mass estimates .",
    "we emphasize again that the successful detection of the donor spectrum is probably limited to times near @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the next opportunities will occur near 2003 april 28 and 2003 october 2 .",
