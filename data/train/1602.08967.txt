    "single pion photoproduction on nucleons has been abundantly studied since the early fifties . the first low - energy theorems ( let ) trying to describe the reaction close to threshold",
    "were obtained in the pioneering work of kroll and ruderman  @xcite in a model - independent way by imposing gauge and lorentz invariance .",
    "their results were later improved by using current algebra and the partial conservation of the axial - current  @xcite .",
    "these let were quite successful on the description of the charged pion channels but showed clear discrepancies with data for the @xmath3 process  @xcite .",
    "bernard et al .",
    "@xcite found some corrections coming from loop - diagram contributions in a chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) calculation , which significantly reduced these discrepancies .",
    "later , they calculated the reaction in heavy - baryon chpt ( hbchpt ) .",
    "this approach , introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , provides a systematic power - counting scheme solving the problems found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the loops with baryons . for the data available at the time ,",
    "the agreement with a fourth - order analysis was very good  @xcite .",
    "however , the advent of new and high precision threshold data for both cross sections and photon asymmetries  @xcite , from the mainz microtron ( mami ) , showed that this approach is not sufficient for the full description of the process .",
    "in fact , the agreement of the hbchpt calculation up to @xmath4 with data is good only up to about @xmath5 above threshold , as shown in ref .  @xcite . for higher energies ,",
    "the convergence is spoiled and would require an even higher - order calculation with many unknown low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are some alternative renormalization schemes to deal with the power - counting problem of the baryon loops . in particular , the extended on mass shell ( eoms ) chpt  @xcite , though technically more complicated , keeps covariance and satisfies analyticity constraints , both lost in the hbchpt formulation .",
    "furthermore , it usually converges faster .",
    "this model succeeded in describing processes like pion - scattering and many baryon observables in the low - energy regime .",
    "examples are masses , magnetic moments , axial form factors , among others  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as the description of the neutral pion photoproduction on protons goes , the fully covariant calculation up to fourth order  @xcite seems even slightly worse than what the hbchpt approaches had obtained so far .    a possibility to improve",
    "the convergence , which we explore in this work , is the explicit inclusion of the @xmath0 resonance as an additional degree of freedom . at higher energies",
    ", the @xmath6 clearly dominates the neutral pion photoproduction cross section  @xcite . even close to threshold , its consideration could speed up the convergence of the chiral series if the size of the resonance tail is still large as compared to the purely nucleonic mechanisms .",
    "the possible relevance of the @xmath6 mechanisms in our process was already suggested by hemmert et al .",
    "@xcite and later in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath6 resonance has been included as a dynamic degree of freedom in many works .",
    "for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite study pion electro- and photoproduction although their focus is at higher energies .",
    "there are also eoms chpt analysis of compton scattering  @xcite and @xmath7 scattering  @xcite . for the case of neutral pion photoproduction close to threshold",
    ", the @xmath6 mechanisms have been investigated in hbchpt  @xcite , getting only moderate effects . as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this small effect could be due to the fact that both were static calculations , which omitted the fast energy dependence that comes from the full consideration of the @xmath6 propagator .",
    "there is also a more recent work in progress in hbchpt at @xmath4 which shows a clear improvement when the @xmath6 resonance is included  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the process @xmath3 in covariant chpt , incorporating the @xmath6 resonance as an explicit degree of freedom .",
    "the calculation was of chiral order @xmath8 in the @xmath2 counting , which will be discussed below .",
    "this amounts to a nucleonic sector with tree - level and loop diagrams , but only tree diagrams containing @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath6 pieces only depended on two relatively well known couplings , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the results were very promising and showed a good agreement with data for both differential cross sections and asymmetries up to above 200 mev .",
    "in this work , we extend the calculation to the next order in the @xmath2 counting , namely @xmath11 , which basically adds loop diagrams with @xmath6 propagators .",
    "the loop diagrams do not require any additional coupling .",
    "there is only one new lec , @xmath12 , which appears in a tree diagram and is poorly known .",
    "furthermore , we are able to describe the process consistently with lecs which are mostly constrained by other observables .",
