    "in massive mimo , large collocated or distributed antenna arrays are deployed at wireless base stations @xcite .",
    "collocated massive mimo architectures , where all service antennas are located in a compact area , have the advantage that the backhaul requirements are low . by contrast ,",
    "in distributed massive mimo , the service antennas are spread out over a wide area . owing to its ability to fully exploit macro - diversity and differences in path loss , distributed massive mimo can potentially offer a very high probability of coverage . at the same time",
    ", it can offer all the advantages of collocated massive mimo . despite its potential",
    ", however , fairly little work on distributed massive mimo is available in the literature . some comparisons between distributed and collocated systems were performed in @xcite for the uplink and in @xcite for the downlink . in @xcite , perfect channel state information was assumed to be available both at the base station and at the users .",
    "on a parallel avenue , small - cell systems , where the base stations do not cooperate coherently , are often viewed as enablers for high spectral efficiency and coverage @xcite . however , a comparison between small - cell and distributed massive mimo is not yet available .",
    "* contribution of the paper : * we consider a distributed massive mimo system where a large number of service antennas , called access points ( aps ) , and a much smaller number of autonomous users are distributed at random over a wide area .",
    "all aps cooperate via a backhaul network , and serve all users in the same time - frequency resource via time - division duplex ( tdd ) operation .",
    "there are no cells or cell boundaries .",
    "hence , we call this system `` cell - free massive mimo '' .",
    "cell - free massive mimo is expected to offer many advantages : 1 ) a huge throughput , coverage probability and energy efficiency ; and 2 ) averaging out of small - scale fading and uncorrelated noise so that the performance depends only on the large - scale fading . in this paper , we restrict the discussion to the downlink of cell - free systems with conjugate beamforming .",
    "we assume that the channels are estimated through uplink pilots .",
    "the paper makes the following specific contributions :    * we derive a closed - form expression for the achievable rate with a finite number of aps , taking into account channel estimation errors , power control , and the non - orthogonality of pilot sequences . in @xcite , corresponding capacity bounds were derived assuming pilot sequences are orthogonal .",
    "* we design two pilot assignment schemes : _ random pilot assignment _ and _ greedy pilot assignment_. we show that the greedy pilot assignment is better . * we propose a max - min power control algorithm that maximizes the smallest of all user rates , under a per - ap power constraint .",
    "this power control problem is formulated as a quasi - convex optimization problem .",
    "* we compare the performance of cell - free massive mimo and conventional small - cell systems under uncorrelated and correlated shadowing models .",
    "conclusions of this comparison are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath1 aps that serve @xmath2 users in the same time - frequency resource . all aps and users",
    "are equipped with a single antenna , and they are randomly located in a large area . in this work ,",
    "we consider the downlink with conjugate beamforming .",
    "we consider only the conjugate beamforming technique since it is simple and can be implemented in a distributed manner .",
    "the transmission from the aps to the users proceed by tdd operation , including two phases for each coherence interval : uplink training and downlink payload data transmission . in the uplink training phase , the users send pilot sequences to the aps and each ap estimates its own csi .",
    "this is performed in a decentralized fashion .",
    "the so - obtained channel estimates are used to precode the transmit signals .",
    "let @xmath3 be the length of the coherence interval ( in samples ) , and let @xmath4 be the length of uplink training duration ( in samples ) per coherence interval .",
    "it is required that @xmath5 . during the training phase , all @xmath2 users simultaneously send pilot sequences of length @xmath4 samples to the aps .",
    "let @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , be the pilot sequence used by the @xmath8th user",
    ". then , the @xmath9 pilot vector received at the @xmath10th ap is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalized transmit signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of each pilot symbol , @xmath13 is a vector of additive noise at the @xmath10th ap  whose elements are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath14 rvs , and @xmath15 denotes the channel coefficient between the @xmath8th user and the @xmath10th ap",
    ". the channel @xmath15 is modeled as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the small - scale fading , and @xmath18 represents the path loss and large - scale fading .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are i.i.d.@xmath14 rvs .",
    "the assumption of independent small - scale fading is reasonable since the aps and the users are distributed over a wide area , and hence , the set of scatterers is likely to be different for each ap and each user .",
    "based on the received pilot signal @xmath21 , the @xmath10th ap will estimate the channel @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the projection of @xmath21 on @xmath24 : @xmath25 although , for arbitrary pilot sequences , @xmath26 is not a sufficient statistic for the estimation of @xmath15 , one can still use @xmath26 to obtain suboptimal estimates . in the case where any pair of pilot sequences is",
    "either fully correlated or exactly orthogonal , then @xmath26 is a sufficient statistic , and estimates based on @xmath26 are optimal .",
    "the mmse estimate of @xmath15 given @xmath26 is @xmath27    [ remark pilot ]",
    "if @xmath28 , then we can choose @xmath29 so that they are pairwisely orthogonal , and hence , the second term in disappears . however , owing to the limited length of the coherence interval , in general , @xmath30 , and non - orthogonal pilot sequences must be used by different users . the channel estimate @xmath31",
    "is degraded by pilot signals transmitted from other users ( the second term in ) .",
    "this causes the so - called pilot contamination effect .",
    "there is still room for a considerable number of orthogonal pilots . for the case of pedestrians with mobility less than 3",
    "km / h , at a 2 ghz carrier frequency the product of the coherence bandwidth and the coherence time is equal to @xmath32 ( assuming a delay spread of @xmath33 @xmath34s ) @xcite , so if half of the coherence time is utilized for pilots then there is an available pool of @xmath35 mutually orthogonal pilots .",
    "the aps treat the channel estimates as the true channels , and use conjugate beamforming to transmit signals to the @xmath2 users .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , be the symbol intended for the @xmath8th user . with conjugate beamforming , the transmitted signal from the @xmath10th ap is @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are power control coefficients chosen to satisfy the following average power constraint at each ap : @xmath41 with the channel model in , the power constraint @xmath42 can be rewritten as : @xmath43 where @xmath44    the received signal at the @xmath8th user is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents additive gaussian noise at the @xmath8th user .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath36 will be detected from @xmath48 .",
    "in this section , we derive a closed - form expression for the achievable rate , using similar analysis techniques as in @xcite .",
    "we assume that each user has knowledge of the channel statistics but not of the channel realizations .",
    "the received signal @xmath48 in can be rewritten as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a deterministic factor that scales the desired signal , and @xmath52 is an `` effective noise '' term which equals the rhs of minus @xmath53 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the effective noise and the desired signal are uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , by using the fact that uncorrelated gaussian noise represents the worst case , we obtain the following achievable rate of the @xmath8th user for cell - free ( cf ) operation : @xmath54    we next provide a new exact closed - form expression for the achievable rate given by , for a finite number of aps .",
    "( the proof uses a standard gaussian - is - worst - case - noise argument and is omitted here due to space limitations . )",
    "[ theorem rate ] an achievable rate of the transmission from the aps to the @xmath8th user is given by , shown at the top of the next page .",
    "in this section , we will present methods to assign the pilot sequences to the users , and to control the power .",
    "note that pilot assignment and power control are decoupled problems because the pilots are not power controlled .",
    "as discussed in remark  [ remark pilot ] , non - orthogonal pilot sequences must be used by different users due to the limited length of the coherence interval .",
    "the main question is how the pilot sequences should be assigned to the @xmath2 users . in the following , we present two simple pilot assignment schemes .      since the length of the pilot sequences is @xmath4 , we can have @xmath4 orthogonal pilot sequences . with random pilot assignment ,",
    "each user will be randomly assigned one pilot sequence from the set of @xmath4 orthogonal pilot sequences .",
    "this random pilot assignment method is simple .",
    "however , with high probability , two users that are in close vicinity of each other will use the same pilot sequence . as a result , the performance of these users is not good , due to the high pilot contamination effect .",
    "next we propose a simple greedy pilot assignment method , that addresses the shortcomings of random pilot assignment . with greedy pilot assignment ,",
    "the @xmath2 users are first randomly assigned @xmath2 pilot sequences .",
    "then the worst - user ( with lowest rate ) , say user @xmath8 , updates its pilot sequence so that its pilot contamination effect is minimized .",
    "the algorithms then proceeds iteratively .",
    "note that the greedy pilot assignment can be performed at a central processing unit .    the pilot contamination effect at the @xmath8th user is reflected by the second term in which has variance @xmath55 so , the worst - user ( the @xmath8th user ) will find a new pilot sequence which minimizes the pilot contamination , summed over all aps : @xmath56 since @xmath7 , the expression in is a rayleigh quotient , and hence , the updated pilot sequence of the @xmath8th user is the eigenvector which corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath57 .",
    "in our work , we focus on max - min power control . specifically , given realizations of the large - scale fading , we find the power control coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath58 , which maximize the minimum of the rates of all users , under the power constraint : @xmath59 define @xmath60 . then , by introducing the slack variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and using , we can reformulate as @xmath63    we then have the following result .",
    "( the proof is omitted due to space constraints . )",
    "[ prop1 ] the optimization problem is quasi - concave .",
    "since the optimization problem is quasi - concave , it can be solved efficiently by using bisection and solving a sequence of convex feasibility problems @xcite .",
    "we provide some numerical results on cell - free massive mimo performance .",
    "the @xmath1 aps and @xmath2 users are uniformly distributed at random within a square of size @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 models the path loss and shadow fading , according to @xmath66 where @xmath67 represents path loss , and @xmath68 represents shadow fading with standard deviation @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "we use a three - slope model for the path loss @xcite : the path loss exponent equals @xmath71 if the distance between the @xmath10th ap and the @xmath8th user ( denoted by @xmath72 ) is greater than @xmath73 , equals @xmath74 if @xmath75 , and equals @xmath76 if @xmath77 . to determine the path loss in absolute numbers , we employ the hata - cost231 propagation model for @xmath78 .    in all examples ,",
    "we choose the following parameters : the carrier frequency is @xmath79 ghz , the ap radiated power is @xmath80 mw , the noise figure ( uplink and downlink ) is @xmath81 db , the ap antenna height is @xmath82 m , the user antenna height is @xmath83 m , @xmath84 db , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 m. to avoid boundary effects , and to imitate a network with infinite area , the square area is wrapped around .    , without power control . here ,",

    "the `` bound '' curve shows the case where all @xmath2 users are assigned orthogonal pilot sequences , so there is no pilot contamination . as expected , when @xmath4 increases , the pilot contamination effect reduces , and hence , the rate increases .",
    "we can see that when @xmath92 , then by using greedy pilot assignment the 95%-likely minimum rate can be doubled as compared to when random pilot assignment is used .",
    "in addition , even when @xmath4 is very small ( @xmath93 ) , cell - free massive mimo still provides good service for all users .",
    "more importantly , the gap between the performance of greedy pilot assignment and the bound is not significant .",

    "next , we investigate the effect of shadowing correlation on both small - cell and cell - free massive mimo systems .",
    "most existing correlation models for the shadow fading model two correlation effects from the user perspective : cross - correlation and spatial correlation @xcite .",

    "doing so is reasonable when the base station antennas are located high above the ground , and all base stations are well separated .",
    "however , in our system models , both the aps and the users are located randomly in the network , and they may be close to each other .",
    "in addition , the ap antenna elevation is not very high .",
    "hence , the correlation at the ap side should be taken into account as well .",
    "we will use the following modified correlation model for the shadow fading : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are independent .",
    "the quantity @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) represents the cross - correlation at the ap side , and @xmath110 represents the cross - correlation at the user side .",
    "the spatial correlation is reflected via the correlation between @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and the correlation between @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "we define @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these correlation coefficients depend on the spatial locations of the aps and on the users : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the distance between the @xmath10th and @xmath119th aps , @xmath120 is the distance between the @xmath8th and @xmath121th users , and @xmath122 is the decorrelation distance which depends on the environment .",
