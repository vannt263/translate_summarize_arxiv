    "while in field theoretic studies we are often led to consider the one - loop effective action in some nontrivial backgrounds , it is quite difficult to have it explicitly evaluated . also lacking are well - controlled approximation schemes for the quantity , which can cover broad types of backgrounds .",
    "this is true in four spacetime dimensions especially .",
    "recently , for the case involving radially symmetric backgrounds , we ( with g. dunne ) @xcite developed a new partial - wave - based calculational scheme , the partial wave cutoff method , by which the exact computation of fully renormalized one - loop effective actions can be performed explicitly .",
    "this method is a unique package of analytical and numerical procedures ( to treat high and low partial - wave contributions , respectively ) .",
    "so far it has been applied to the accurate determination of qcd single - instanton determinants for arbitrary quark mass values @xcite , to the prefactor calculation in the false vacuum decay @xcite , and to the evaluation of the scalar one - loop effective actions ( for any given mass values ) in a class of abelian or non - abelian radially symmetric background gauge fields @xcite .",
    "also , very recently , the fermion one - loop effective action in abelian radial background gauge fields has been studied by this method @xcite , an important byproduct of this work being that there exist marked differences between the small mass mass limits of the derivative expansion for spinor and scalar theories .    in this paper",
    "the partial wave cutoff method will be used to study 4-d fermion one - loop effective actions in a class of genuinely _",
    "non - abelian _ , radially symmetric , background gauge fields .",
    "this case differs from those of our earlier studies in that , as the differential operators pertaining to partial wave sectors are not completely separate , we here have to deal with an infinite number of functional determinants for _ matrix - valued radial differential operators_. one might then suspect that , because of technical difficulties in renormalizing the infinite product of such functional determinants and also in performing the needed numerical calculations , our whole approach becomes impractical in this case . despite this complication ,",
    "it will be demonstrated here that our method can suitably be extended such that the exact computation of the effective action becomes possible for this case as well .",
    "there are also issues specifically involving _ fermion _ effective action ( e.g. , the massless limit behavior ) , and we intend to provide clarification on such aspect .",
    "specifically , in a 4-d euclidean su(2 ) gauge theory , we will consider in this work the one - loop effective action of a dirac field ( with mass @xmath0 and in the fundamental representation ) when the background gauge fields are given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are t hooft symbols @xcite . writing @xmath5 , the radial function @xmath6 is then assumed to have the form @xmath7 \\text{(case ii ) } & : & h_{\\text{ii}}(r;r,\\beta ) = \\frac{(r/\\rho)^2}{1+(r/\\rho)^2 } \\frac{1+\\tanh ( \\frac{r - r}{\\beta \\rho})}{2 } , \\quad ( \\beta \\text { can take \\emph{either } sign } ) \\label{case2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with constant background parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this genuinely non - abelian background field has been chosen so that one can learn something about the behavior of the corresponding fermion effective action as one changes the background parameters ( and fermion mass @xmath0 ) .",
    "note that , in case i ( and case ii with @xmath12 ) , our background gauge fields have the pontryagin index equal to @xmath13 ; on the other hand , case ii with @xmath14 ( and the ratio @xmath15 significantly larger than 1 ) corresponds to a well - separated instanton - antiinstanton configuration with zero pontryagin index .",
    "[ the pontryagin index of the fields ( [ amuform ] ) is determined by the two numbers ( see ( [ pontryagin ] ) ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have given the plots of the function @xmath6 for some representative choices of our free parameters .",
    "needless to say , with these backgrounds , the small mass limit of the fermion one - loop effective action becomes particularly interesting physically ( because of the issue concerning fermion zero modes ) . in a well - separated instanton - antiinstanton configuration , the related effect",
    "is also believed to generate long - range interaction between instanton and antiinstanton @xcite .",
    "our study should illuminate such aspect , too .",
    "for the choice @xmath18 or @xmath19 in case i above , our fields ( [ amuform ] ) represent single instanton or antiinstanton _ solutions _",
    "@xcite , in the regular ( for @xmath18 ) or singular ( for @xmath20 ) gauge . these are ( anti-)self - dual backgrounds , and here we have a simple relationship @xcite between the fermion one - loop effective action and that for a scalar field , which can be exploited for the effective action calculation .",
    "this was crucial in the calculation of @xcite .",
    "but , for other cases we will consider , we need to perform an entirely separate calculation for fermions ; in this direct fermion analysis , additional complication due to the magnetic moment coupling term arises . here",
    "we have found that the recently established chiral separation of the fermion effective action @xcite can be utilized to the full advantage  thanks to the latter , our technique to evaluate functional determinants of _ radially separable _ differential operators can be extended to our problem involving dirac fields .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe a general outline for the calculational scheme we shall use , and also collect , for later use in the paper , various useful formulas .",
    "this is followed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] by our analysis for the high partial - wave contribution to the fermion effective action ; this part is calculated analytically using a wkb - type asymptotic series , for matrix - valued radial differential operators in this paper .",
    "we then combine this high partial - wave contribution with the low partial - wave contribution in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , to obtain the explicit results for the renormalized fermion effective action with the background fields specified as above .",
    "an important part in the computation of the low partial wave contribution is the evaluation of functional determinants with matrix - valued differential operators , and for this we use the ( generalized ) gelfand - yaglom approach @xcite .",
    "the partial wave contributions must be summed according to certain specific grouping procedure . in the limit",
    "the fermion mass approaches zero , we can give a semi - analytical treatment for partial - wave functional determinants and the results are used to discuss various features that the fermion effective action in the massless limit exhibits .",
    "( see for instance our formula ( [ case1final ] ) , where the exact small - mass - limit form of the fermion one - loop effective action in our general case i backgrounds is given ) .",
    "this is possible because , unlike the scalar field case , partial - wave radial differential operators in the spinor case enjoys certain factorization property .",
    "also presented are the results with nonzero mass .",
    "this involves an extensive numerical work , but , with our method of accelerating the convergence , numerically exact effective action can be obtained without excessive labor . for large fermion mass ,",
    "we recover from our expression the result of large mass expansion . from our computation of the fermion",

    "[ sec3 ] , can be found in appendix [ appendixa ] . in appendix [ appendixb ]",
    "we clarify some subtle aspect arising when one uses the gelfand - yaglom approach in computing partial - wave functional determinants in the massless limit .",

    "@xcite for more detailed discussions ) and write the corresponding solution as @xmath394 ( instead of @xmath395 ) .",

    "let us apply this to our case i. the functional determinants for partial waves corresponding to @xmath244 at small mass limit can be found immediately . from ( [ masslesspsip ] ) and ( [ masslesspsim ] ) , the large-@xmath10 behaviors of the massless solutions are @xmath415 thus , by identifying @xmath410 from these behaviors and plugging them to ( [ psiasymp ] ) ( with @xmath416 for @xmath417 ) , we find that @xmath418 now one can verify explicitly that these small mass limits yield , if used for a certain specific group ( indicated in the main text ) , the same results as those based on the exact zero mass results such as ( [ ljcombination2 ] ) with the same @xmath419 combination .    for @xmath98 ( and when the function @xmath57 approaches 1 as @xmath130 ) , it is rather difficult to follow the method of ref .",

    ", the massless gy solution ( [ psi1sol ] ) corresponds to the _ normalizable zero mode_. as a result , the small-@xmath126 solution can not be matched with the large-@xmath126 solution of the form ( [ leadinglarger ] ) .",

    "@xcite , which utilizes the normalizable character of the massless solution in a crucial way , can be simpler .",

    "the result is finite , and in this way we can secure the following result for the related functional determinant : @xmath434    we now turn to the case with @xmath97 , where the gy solutions are given by @xmath201 matrices .",
    "first , note that we can approximate the potential in ( [ largereq ] ) for small mass @xmath0 as @xmath435 thus the leading order solution of ( [ largereq ] ) using the matrix potential given above is @xmath436 where @xmath437 is a constant @xmath201 matrix which can be determined using the condition ( [ demand ] ) at @xmath400 . to find @xmath437 , we need to know an asymptotic behavior of the massless gy solution . for this @xmath97",
    "the massless solution is given in ( [ psilpre ] ) , with relevant expressions also in ( [ psi1explicit ] ) , ( [ psi2 ] ) and ( [ phi3explicit ] ) .",
    "since this solution was found after a suitable unitary transformation was performed ( with the help of the unitary matrix @xmath438 in ( [ udef ] ) ) , our condition ( [ demand ] ) translates to @xmath439 as the asymptotic behavior of the determinant of @xmath440 is given in ( [ detpsi1asymp ] ) , we find that @xmath441 the true asymptotic behavior of the determinant of the gy wave function can then be found as @xmath442 with @xmath443 given by ( [ c0result ] ) .",
    "based on this , we obtain the following result : @xmath444 here note that @xmath443 corresponds to the result of the related massless functional determinant .",
    "therefore ( [ psilsmallmlimit ] ) apparently shows that the small mass limit of the functional determinant is different from the massless functional determinant . only with the combination in ( [ gammal ] ) , the small mass limit and exact zero mass analysis yield the same results .",
