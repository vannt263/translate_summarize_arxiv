    "laser is also commonly employed in coherent population trapping ( cpt ) experiments on alkali - metal vapor @xcite , in which a coherent two - frequency laser beam couples two ground states to a common excited state forming a  @xmath0 \" shaped system . when the difference of the two frequencies equals the ground state splitting , i.e. at raman resonance ,",
    "the atoms are trapped into a state superposition , the dark state or cpt state , which is decoupled from the laser field @xcite .",
    "atoms trapped in a dark state do not absorb the laser light , so that the light intensity transmitted by the medium increases",
    ". as the cpt resonance linewidth is defined by the coherence lifetime in the ground state , a narrow resonance is observed which can be used to make compact atomic clocks or magnetometers .",
    "atomic clocks using alkali - metal atoms @xcite are based on the microwave transition @xmath1 , the ( @xmath2 ) transition , because of its reduced sensitivity to the magnetic field .",
    "here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the total angular momenta of the hyperfine levels of the ground state , @xmath5 is the magnetic quantum number .",
    "realization of a superposition state of the @xmath6 states requires a circularly polarized field because of selection rules ( the transition @xmath7 is forbidden , @xmath8 and @xmath9 hold for the ground and the excited state respectively ) .",
    "but in practice , the zeeman sublevels of the ground state complicate the situation .",
    "a circularly polarized bichromatic laser will pump the atomic populations into the  end - states \" , corresponding to the zeeman sub - levels of maximum or minimum magnetic quantum number @xmath5 .",
    "this zeeman optical pumping @xcite , not only decreases the population involved in the ( @xmath2 ) cpt resonance , reducing the maximum transmitted power , but also increases the transmitted laser power off raman resonance , the background level .",
    "this drawback might be overcome by using counter - rotating circular polarizations .",
    "however the dark states built by these two polarizations are out of phase in the involved double lambda system (  @xmath10 \" ) , because one of the four electric dipole moments involved is of opposite sign to the three others . in the rotating frame and at resonance , the dark states built with the clock states @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarizations can be written @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rabi frequency of the laser field tuned to the @xmath16 transition , @xmath17 is the phase difference between both fields in @xmath18 polarization . so that , with the same phase difference , the dark state built by a circular polarization is destroyed by the counter - rotating polarization , and vice versa .",
    "this is why the clock transition can not be observed with lin@xmath19lin polarizations @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that counter - rotating circular polarizations are efficient if one of the two circularly polarized beam is phase delayed by @xmath20 relative to the other @xcite , or equivalently by linearly and orthogonally polarized beams @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use a beam with alternating opposite circular polarizations @xcite .",
    "the phase shift of both dark states can be compensated by properly choosing the phase difference between the two components of the bichromatic laser , the raman phase @xcite .",
    "we have shown that if the two components of the bichromatic field are in phase for one polarization , they must be out of phase of @xmath20 in the opposite polarization @xcite .",
    "such a simultaneous modulation of polarization and raman phase prevents the atomic population from being pumped into the end zeeman states .",
    "atomic population accumulates every cycle in the common dark state whereas a strong absorption remains off - resonance .",
    "both effects would enhance the cpt resonance amplitude , which is one of the most important parameters in atomic clock , atomic magnetometer and high precision spectroscopy applications .",

    "we experimentally study the build - up and decrease of the cpt transitions amplitudes in presence of a single circularly polarized beam .",
    "the double modulation ( polarization and phase ) scheme is then addressed .",

    "[ fig14]b shows the impact of the detection delay time on the ramsey signal amplitude during the second pulse .",
    "the signal is maximized by a short delay @xmath191 because for longer times the atomic system evolves towards its steady state , ramsey fringes vanish , we come back to the one pulse case @xcite .",
    "the diminution of ramsey fringes over time explains also the decrease of the signal with the detection length @xmath192 . for short detection windows @xmath192 ,",
    "an oscillation appears on the probe signal with a period of about @xmath193 and decays quickly with a time constant of about @xmath169 .",

    "the oscillation is no longer visible after a longer @xmath191 value or averaged window time @xmath192 .",

    "we have shown that the cpt transition amplitude obtained with a single circularly polarized bichromatic field increases with time until a maximum , before vanishing because of longer response time of the zeeman pumping .",
    "the backgound level meets the resonance top at the steady - state .",
    "zeeman pumping can be circumvented by polarization modulation . however , due to the relative phase ( see the clebsch - gordan coefficients in ref .  ) of the electric dipole moments involved in the transitions , an additional synchronous raman phase modulation is needed to generate a constructive and highly - contrasted cpt resonance . with this double modulation technique , a non - zero",

    "the optimal modulation frequency @xmath181 is found approximately proportional to the optical pumping rate and satisfying this relation : @xmath182 .",
    "the typical range of @xmath181 at a few releases the demand on the polarization switch time .",
    "experimental results are in good agreement with a simple seven - level theoretical model .",
    "the double modulation technique can be combined with a pulsed ( ramsey ) interrogation method . in this case , the polarization is not modulated during the detection pulse . the high contrast and narrow linewidth observed in ramsey - cpt interrogation show the potential of double modulation to build a high performance cpt clock .",
    "meanwhile , we can also maintain the compactness and robustness of cpt clock , e.g. , by directly modulating a high modulation bandwidth dfb laser diode to remove the eopm , and utilizing a liquid crystal polarization switch @xcite to replace the eom .",
