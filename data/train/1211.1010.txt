    "large optical and nir surveys with hst , such as the hudf / hudf09 @xcite , goods / candels @xcite , or borg @xcite allowed us to identify large numbers of galaxies at @xmath12 which are used to study the galaxy build - up in the first 1.5 gyr of cosmic time .",
    "one of the main shortcomings of hst surveys , however , is that they only probe the rest - frame uv light of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "even the recently installed nir camera wfc3/ir only probes to @xmath13   at @xmath11 and the crucial rest - frame optical wavelengths are out of reach of hst . the observed light of high - redshift galaxies is thus strongly susceptible to dust extinction .",

    "several surveys have obtained deep imaging in the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] bands over a number of fields to cover the rest - frame optical of the large samples of high - redshift galaxies that were identified with hst .",
    "such data are crucial for an unbiased study of the galaxy stellar mass build - up at @xmath16 .",

    "despite some debate in the early literature , the rest - frame uv data alone indicate that uv bright galaxies at @xmath19 , on average , show redder uv spectral slopes @xmath3 than their lower luminosity counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this trend is likely caused by an increase in dust extinction at bright luminosities , since small amounts of dust have strong effects on the rest - frame uv colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when including @xmath14/irac photometry to measure rest - frame uv - to - optical colors as a function of uv luminosity , @xcite and @xcite find that these colors are broadly consistent with being just due to dust extinction assuming a similar stellar population age at different uv luminosities .",
    "such a measurement can be significantly biased , however , if the galaxy population shows large scatter in dust extinction at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "an obvious next step is therefore to study galaxy colors as a function of rest - frame optical luminosity , which is significantly less affected by dust extinction and is a much more reliable proxy for galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the main reason that such studies are not readily done is the difficulty of measuring accurate irac photometry for faint high - redshift sources , given the wide irac psf of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 the hst psf ) . without a neighbor - subtraction scheme , only about @xmath23 of galaxies are isolated enough for reliable aperture photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another complication of rest - frame optical studies from broad - band irac photometry at @xmath11 are strong emission lines .",

    "this would have very important consequences on the total inferred cosmic star - formation rate density .",
    "however , it is a concern whether the many high - quality photometric constraints in the rest - frame uv compared to the few data points in the rest - frame optical could be biasing the ages determined from standard sed fits .",

    "both these filter fluxes are indeed significantly higher than the best - fit sed for all stacks . ]",
    "previous studies that were based on binning galaxies as a function of rest - frame uv luminosities suggested that the average uv - to - optical sed of galaxies changes only very little with luminosity .",
    "for instance , @xcite find rest - frame @xmath81 colors that get redder by only 0.026 per mag in uv luminosity .",
    "such weak trends were in good agreement with the suggestion from sph simulations that found star - formation histories of galaxies to be essentially self - similar @xcite .",
    "our findings above suggest that using rest - frame optical luminosities to bin and stack galaxy seds , much more significant trends should become apparent .",
    "this is indeed the case as shown in figure [ fig : stackedsed ] , where we present seds in bins of @xmath82 .",
    "a significant increase in reddening toward brighter @xmath83-band luminosities is obvious in these stacks .",
    "while these seds span 3 mag in @xmath52 , they only vary by @xmath84 mag in uv luminosity . furthermore",
    ", the stacked seds show a clear correlation between the uv continuum slope and the uv - to - optical color .",
    "this indicates that galaxies that are luminous in the rest - frame optical are significantly more dust obscured than fainter systems , which is likely the origin for the steeper trend in the @xmath4 $ ] color we found in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "finally , from these stacks it is clear that h@xmath50 flux contamination is indeed a potential problem for our @xmath2-dropout sample .",
    "all stacked seds show a significant excess at 3.6  @xmath85 m compared to the best - fit sed , ranging from 0.06 mag to 0.14 mag , with a tentative trend to a larger excess at fainter luminosities .",
    "since h@xmath50 is only present in the [ 3.6 ] filter at @xmath80 ( i.e. in @xmath86 of our redshift selection ) , these numbers are roughly consistent with the mean excess of 0.27 mag as inferred by @xcite , in particular for fainter sources .    a potential problem with the above measurements are the combination of different selection effects that can result in biased distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we show the estimated completeness limits of our data as dashed lines .",
    "the vertical limit is due to the irac s / n cut , while the slanted line is mostly caused by the @xmath31-band cut , but its slope is influenced by the correlation between @xmath4 $ ] vs @xmath3 ( see figure [ fig : betaj1 ] ) due to the lbg selection .",
    "the completeness lines are estimated based on simulating a large number ( @xmath87 ) of galaxies with synthetic seds with @xmath88 to @xmath89 , with uv slopes in the range @xmath90 to @xmath91 , and with redshifts according to our redshift selection function ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fluxes of these seds are then perturbed with gaussian dispersions and all the selection criteria are applied , from which we compute the completeness as a function of @xmath52 and @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "clearly , at faint luminosities , we are potentially biased against red sources in the goods data . however , the @xmath4 $ ] color distribution peaks at sufficiently bluer colors than the completeness limit . using the simulations above",
    ", we estimate that the observed mean color at @xmath92 is not significantly biased due to selection effects ( @xmath93 mag ) .",
    "finally , photometric errors in [ 4.5 ] might bias the measurement of the color - magnitude relation of figure [ fig : fig2 ] , since both axes depend on the [ 4.5 ] flux measurement .",
    "a positive error in [ 4.5 ] would result in a brighter @xmath52 with a redder @xmath4 $ ] color .",
    "we therefore checked and confirmed that an analogous steepening in the color - magnitude relation is still seen if the absolute magnitude derived from the [ 3.6 ] photometry is used instead of @xmath52 .",
    "this relation is not shown here due to the possible flux contamination from strong h@xmath50 lines , as explained earlier .",

    "interestingly , a @xcite dust curve would lead to a steeper relation than what is seen in the data .",

    "* ) . one major difficulty in inferring stellar population ages from sed fitting is the degeneracy between dust extinction , age , and metallicity in reproducing the reddening of the uv slope .",
    "these problems are exacerbated at @xmath11 , since hst only probes rest - frame uv wavelengths , and the only rest - frame optical information typically comes from only two @xmath14 bands .    given these complications , it is thus instructive to use assumptions as simple and model independent as possible to test what range of ages is consistent with the data .",
    "this can be done using our simple dust - corrected balmer break colors @xmath124)_{\\beta corr}$ ] . in figure",

    "the fraction of sources with colors consistent with very young ages below @xmath125 yr ( i.e. with @xmath124)_{\\beta corr}<-0.19 $ ] ) is very small ; less than 10% at @xmath127 and only 21% at @xmath115 .",
    "integrated over all galaxies with @xmath104 for which we are complete , the number of galaxies with @xmath124)_{\\beta corr}<-0.19 $ ] is @xmath128% .",
    "a simple correction of this number for photometric scatter suggests that this fraction intrinsically is even smaller , i.e. 12% .",
    "the formal uncertainty on this number is only 1% .",
    "however , we note that this fraction is highly model dependent . in particular , using an sed model with rising star - formation rates , the young fraction is significantly reduced , due to bluer galaxy colors at a given age .",
    "additionally , in the appendix we estimate that using the standard m99 and @xcite dust relations and seds with constant star - formation would result in a young fraction of 19% . despite of these uncertainties ,",
    "the observed color distributions indicate that the galaxy population may only contain a relatively small number of extremely young sources , in contrast to earlier findings in the literature based on full sed fitting .      using our corrected color distribution",
    ", we can set interesting constraints on the ages and star - formation histories ( sfhs ) of @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "in particular , we can fit for the distribution of galaxy ages under the assumption of smooth sfhs .",
    "this is done as follows : we sample galaxy ages from a normal distribution in log(age ) with mean @xmath129 and width @xmath130 . we then compute the expected galaxy @xmath4 $ ] color for the given age , assuming either a constant star - formation rate ( csf ) or a power - law rising star - formation history ( @xmath123 , rsf ) .",
    "the latter is the population average sfh consistent with the evolution of the uv lf @xcite .",
    "the photometry is then perturbed using the real flux uncertainties of our galaxy sample , and the resulting histogram is compared to the data using a poissonian likelihood of the number counts .",
    "the best - fit color distributions are shown in figure [ fig : agesimhist ] .",
    "these correspond to gaussian age distributions with @xmath131 and @xmath132 for constant star - formation and @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the rising star - formation histories .",
    "the somewhat older mean stellar population age for the latter sfh is a result of bluer galaxy colors at a fixed stellar population age , given the dominance of younger stars .",
    "again , for both these distributions , we find a very small number of galaxies with ages younger than 100 myr ( only 13% for csf and 4% for rsf ) .",
    "interestingly , however , these distributions predict that a significant fraction of galaxies ( 50% for csf and 24% for rsf ) would not have been forming stars for longer than 400 myr , which is the time between @xmath135 and @xmath0 .",
    "these sources would therefore not have been present in the higher redshift lbg sample .",
    "the mean formation redshift of our sample is inferred to be @xmath136 or @xmath137 assuming csf or rsf , respectively .",
    "while the gaussian age distributions for both assumptions on the sfhs do reproduce the observed color histograms rather well , they fall somewhat short at the bluest and reddest tails of the distribution .",

    "solid lines are for pure stellar continuum , while dashed lines include the uv reddening due to nebular continuum emission from hydrogen and helium recombination in the inter - stellar medium of a galaxy ( assuming ionization equilibrium and an escape fraction of 50% for ionizing photons ) .",
    "the shaded gray area spans 68% ( @xmath119 ) of the observed galaxy color distribution at @xmath104 mag ( see figure [ fig : colhist ] ) .",
    "the majority of galaxies clearly has less than a 25% contribution from extremely recent bursts , and sources are consistent with a mass weighted stellar population age between 50 and 500 myr . ]    we can obtain a first constraint on the contribution of extremely short bursts to the total star - formation of galaxies from the expected @xmath4 $ ] color for a two - component sed with a very young population added to an older underlying one .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : jm45agesedlibs ] .",
    "the balmer break color saturates very quickly close to the color of the young component , even for a small mass fraction ( @xmath139 ) produced in a recent burst .",
    "bursty star - formation would therefore significantly tilt the color distribution to young galaxy ages , even if only a small mass fraction is built in bursts .",
    "the exact numbers depend on the detailed assumptions on the underlying old population and burst ages , but this suggests that _ the majority of galaxies is consistent with only a very small fraction of stars being formed in very recent bursts .",
    "_    a further constraint on bursty star - formation can be obtained from the equivalent width distribution of strong rest - frame optical lines . based on galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath80 , @xcite estimated the combined h@xmath50+[sii]+[nii ] equivalent widths from the irac [ 3.6 ] flux excess .",
    "they find that this distribution peaks at @xmath140@xmath141 and has a dispersion of 0.25 dex .",
    "we can estimate the predicted equivalent widths from our age distribution using a simple model for hydrogen recombination . assuming a 10% escape fraction of ionizing photons ( consistent with the most recent estimates for lbgs from * ? ? ? * ) and photoionization equilibrium , we can derive the h@xmath50 emission line strengths from the tables in @xcite and from the total number of ionizing photons that are produced in the sed model .",
    "this calculation shows that our age distributions result in equivalent widths that are lower than the observed values of @xcite by only @xmath90.15 dex , indicating that such smooth sfhs can produce most , but not all of the rest - frame optical line strengths .",
    "bursty star - formation is thus certainly present to produce the most extreme tail of h@xmath50 emission , but it is likely not dominant .    furthermore , we can use these calculations to check what fraction of the equivalent width distribution measured by @xcite requires young galaxy ages . for an sed with an age of 100 myr , we derive a combined h@xmath50+[sii]+[nii ] equivalent width of 480   and 790   for our csf and rsf sfh models , respectively .",
    "the @xcite distribution contains @xmath142 and @xmath143 of galaxies with larger values .",
    "this provides further evidence for relatively small fractions of very young galaxies in lbg samples .    in order to compare our observations with more realistic sfhs",

    "these intrinsic colors are then perturbed by the flux errors from our observational data .",
    "the result of this is shown as thick purple line in figure [ fig : agesimhist ] . obviously , the predicted color histogram is in very good agreement with the observed one , indicating that this sam predicts sfhs that are a very good match to real galaxies .",
    "note , however , that the @xcite model does not do as well in reproducing the dust - reddened ( i.e. directly observed ) color distributions .",
    "furthermore , their model falls short of bright galaxies in the lfs at blue wavelengths at @xmath19 .",
    "as argued in , e.g. , @xcite both these effects are likely connected to uncertainties in the dust modeling .",
    "analyses similar to the ones in our paper will help to further test and refine such models .     to @xmath145 , while the width of the age distribution decreases slightly from @xmath146 at faint luminosities to @xmath147 , depending on the assumed sfh . _",

    "the large sample of galaxies with reliable irac photometry analyzed in this paper allowed us for the first time to study the correlations between uv and optical colors at @xmath0 , as a function of optical luminosity .",
    "the relatively tight correlation we find between the @xmath4 $ ] color and the uv slope @xmath3 in figure [ fig : betaj1 ] provides direct evidence that the main driver for uv reddening in lbg samples is dust extinction .    the shallow slope of this relation is particularly intriguing , since @xcite dust reddening would result in significantly steeper trends .",
    "this could in principle be the result of correlated changes in galaxy ages with dust extinction , such that younger galaxies are more heavily obscured .",
    "however , a more simple explanation is that dust extinction at @xmath0 is more accurately described by an smc - like dust curve .",
    "certainly , our measurements are not ideal to determine the exact shape of the reddening law .",
    "however , the fact that the brightest galaxies do follow a @xmath4 $ ] vs @xmath3 trend that is parallel to the mean trend but offset by a constant value strongly suggests that the correlation is driven by smc dust , and that the offset is due to older stellar population ages compared to the mean .",
    "if this is confirmed in future analyses , the use of smc - like dust would result in small corrections of the reported sfrs for @xmath11 galaxies in the literature .    while both local lyman break analogs and the majority of bright lbgs at @xmath149 are more consistent with calzetti dust extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , smc - like extinction has been found to better reproduce the infrared excess of young , low - luminosity galaxies at @xmath149 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , direct measurements of the ir excess with herschel of @xmath0 galaxies suggests an inverted luminosity dependence , with brighter galaxies having smc - like dust , while fainter galaxies are found to follow the m99 relation @xcite .",
    "clearly , the appropriate dust curve is still an open question .",
    "solving this problem will require a multi - wavelength approach using complete samples of galaxies with unbiased spectroscopic redshifts , and combining deep @xmath28 and @xmath14 data with herschel and alma observations .",
    "further progress should thus be possible in the very near future .",
    "for now , we use the @xmath4 $ ] vs @xmath3 relation to empirically correct the balmer break color for dust extinction .",
    "while the observed @xmath4 $ ] colors are significantly redder for the brightest sources , the dust - corrected colors only show a relatively weak dependence on rest - frame optical luminosity . a residual 0.2 mag difference between galaxies at @xmath105 and fainter sources",
    "is easily explained by a small increase in the stellar population age by only @xmath90.2 dex .",
    "dust extinction is clearly the main contributor to red galaxy colors even at the brightest luminosities , and the steepening of the color - magnitude relation seen in figure [ fig : fig2 ] is the result of a significant increase in the dust reddening in the most massive galaxies .",
    "this could have important consequences for the interpretation of the uv lfs , since increased dust extinction can effectively saturate the uv luminosities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the steeper color - magnitude relation at @xmath150 is an indication that the most massive galaxies produce a significantly higher dust mass relative to their stellar mass than sub-@xmath151 galaxies , or that they can more easily hold on to the dust produced in their supernovae compared to lower mass systems ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although @xcite only rely on rest - frame uv data to infer stellar masses , they find that the most massive galaxies show surprisingly red uv continuum slopes , which would require significant amounts of dust to be present as early as @xmath152 .",
    "a more robust exploration of this effect is now possible based on the large samples with irac photometry ( gonzalez et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "in contrast to the strong trends of dust extinction , the galaxy ages only vary weakly with luminosity .",
    "the inferred mean galaxy ages increase by only 35% to 60% across 2 mag in @xmath83-band luminosity , depending on the assumed sfh ( see figure [ fig : agesimsummary ] ) .",
    "this is derived using the same simulations as described in section [ sec : fitstodistribution ] .",
    "the best - fit distributions show that there are essentially no bright galaxies with colors consistent with being dominated by very young bursts",
    ". however , this fraction appears to be increasing toward fainter luminosities ( lower panel figure [ fig : agesimsummary ] ) , which can further be explored in the near future with the deeper s - candels data .",
    "unfortunately , current simulations of high - redshift galaxies mostly focus on the sub - l * population , due to the very large volumes necessary to sample the brightest galaxies .",
    "however , the very steep increase in dust extinction in @xmath153 galaxies which we find in our data presents an interesting test for galaxy evolution models .",
    "for example , we show that the corrected @xmath4 $ ] color distribution is almost perfectly reproduced by the @xcite sam models , indicating that this sam is reliably predicting galaxy sfhs . however , these same models fail in accurately capturing the observed steepening in the color magnitude relation and in predicting the uv lf and its evolution .",
    "both these effects are likely connected to the uncertain treatment of dust extinction in such models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we combined ultra - deep hst and spitzer imaging to study rest - frame uv - to - optical colors of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we perform a sophisticated neighbor subtraction in the irac images to obtain a sample of 1273 b - dropout galaxies with clean irac [ 4.5 ] detections more significant than 3@xmath154 from two fields of the hudf09 survey as well as from goods - north and south .",
    "the [ 4.5 ] channel data is preferred over the shorter wavelength [ 3.6 ] photometry in order to avoid any flux contamination by strong h@xmath50 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using this sample we find :    * the observed @xmath4 $ ] color is strongly dependent on rest - frame optical luminosity .",
    "in particular , the relation steepens significantly for galaxies with @xmath79 compared to the lower luminosity trend ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) , indicating that the most massive galaxies produce and retain more dust relative to their stellar mass than lower mass galaxies . *",
    "a relatively tight correlation is found between @xmath4 $ ] and the uv continuum slope @xmath3 ( see figure [ fig : betaj1 ] ) .",
    "the most simple explanation for this slope is that the uv - to - optical seds of @xmath0 galaxies are better reproduced by an smc - like dust extinction rather than the standard calzetti dust curve .",
    "this result will have to be confirmed in the future by combining large samples of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with additional longer - wavelength data to constrain the amount of dust extinction . *",
    "the dust - corrected colors of galaxies are only weakly dependent on luminosity , and their distribution is well reproduced by a gaussian in log(age ) of galaxies , with a mean log(age)@xmath155 or 9.00 , depending on the assumed star - formation history ( either constant or rising with time ) . *",
    "only a very small fraction of @xmath156% of galaxies shows colors that are consistent with extremely young galaxy ages , below 100 myr .",
    "the exact number of this fraction is dependent on the assumptions about the star - formation histories of galaxies .",
    "however , the vast majority of galaxies is consistent with a smooth build - up and only a negligible fraction of their stars being formed in very recent burst .",
    "this paper gives a brief preview of the power of combining hst and spitzer observations for studying galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "after completion of the still on - going s - candels program , these types of analyses can be extended to cover more than twice the area of our current sample to a depth of 50 h ( about 0.4 mag deeper than the goods irac data used here ) .",
    "these data sets will allow us to constrain sfh and age distributions of large samples of galaxies at @xmath157 .",
    "in particular when combined with additional constraints on dust extinction , e.g. from herschel or alma , and with spectroscopic redshifts from the new and upcoming multi - object nir spectrographs . this should allow for the next big steps forward over the next few years in working toward a self - consistent picture of star - formation and mass build - up before the peak of cosmic star - formation .",
