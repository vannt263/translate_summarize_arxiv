    "<S> , the singlets that are generated never cross each other , which implies that every singlet state in the ground state will be formed by one spin belonging to sublattice @xmath10 and another spin belonging to sublattice @xmath11 ( a manifestation of the underlying chiral symmetry ) . </S>",

    "<S> this form of the ground state is remarkable because it is a product state constructed from the single - particle states @xmath114 which , like the flat - band limit in the disorder - free system , only have weight on two sites ( although now the sites can be far apart ) . in this basis , the real - space winding number formula drastically simplifies to @xmath115 which is just the sum of vectors connecting the end - points of the singlets . in the clean topological phase @xmath116 and @xmath117 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in the trivial phase , singlets form onsite , which implies @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly illustrates that it is not a single de - localized state which carries the topological winding number , but instead , the entire set of occupied states </S>",
    "<S> . we could adiabatically deform the hamiltonian , while preserving chiral symmetry , so that states of the form @xmath119 become the single - particle eigenstates and then _ each _ state would carry a portion @xmath120 of @xmath121    we can further exploit the mapping to the spin model to understand the nature of the topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> consider disordering a state that is dimerized on the even bonds ( i.e. the topological state ) . from the rg procedure </S>",
    "<S> , one can see that disorder will favour the formation of regions that dimerize on the odd bonds , so that trivial and topological regions coexist . </S>",
    "<S> in the vicinity of the critical point , the low - energy interface states formed between these regions contribute to the spectral density inside the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> this type of behavior corresponds to a griffiths phase @xcite , which is not critical and thus explains why the topological invariant does not change at the gap closing point . </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes critical when dimerization occurs equally on both the odd and even bonds , leading to a proliferation of zero - energy interface states . as a result , both the localization length as well as </S>",
    "<S> the density of states become divergent at zero energy [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> similar physics , albeit in a different context involving superconducting wires , was discussed in refs . , both of which are important precursors for our work . </S>",

    "<S> [ winding ] as expected at criticality . </S>",
    "<S> to further support the claim that the topological phase transition is in the same universality class as the rs phase we numerically confirmed ( see supporting material ) that the critical scaling of the entanglement entropy contains the @xmath122 correction factor to the central charge as expected @xcite . increasing the disorder beyond the critical point dimerizes the system on the odd bonds , which thus leads to the trivial state .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have given a complete picture of the physics of the disordered aiii class in 1d . </S>",
    "<S> we have given a real - space formula for the aiii winding number in all odd dimensions , shown that topological invariants can be carried by localized states , and that , because of this , the levitation and annihilation topological phase transition is replaced by the random singlet transition for the aiii class in 1d . </S>",
