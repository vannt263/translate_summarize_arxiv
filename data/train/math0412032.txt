    "mclean showed that , in a @xmath1 manifold @xmath6 , the space of associative submanifolds near a given one @xmath7 can be identified with the harmonic spinors on @xmath4 twisted by a certain bundle @xmath8 ( the kernel of a twisted dirac operator ) @xcite .",
    "but since we can not control the cokernel of the dirac operator ( it has index zero ) , the dimension of its kernel might vary .",
    "this is the obstruction to smoothness of the moduli space of associative submanifolds .",
    "this problem can be remedied either by deforming the ambient @xmath1 structure ( i.e. by deforming @xmath9 ) or by deforming the connection in the normal bundle @xcite .",
    "the first process might move @xmath9 to a non - integrable @xmath1 structure .",
    "if we are to view @xmath10 as an analogue of a symplectic manifold and @xmath11 a symplectic form , and view the associative submanifolds as analogues of holomorphic curves , deforming @xmath11 would be too destructive . in the second process",
    "we use the connections as auxiliary objects to deform the associative submanifolds in a larger space , just like deforming the holomorphic curves by using almost complex structures ( pseudo - holomorphic curves ) . by this approach",
    "we obtain the smoothness of the moduli space . we get compactness by relating the deformation equation to the seiberg - witten equations .    in this paper",
    "we summarize the results of @xcite where we introduced _",
    "complex associative submanifolds _ of @xmath1 manifolds ; they are associative submanifolds whose normal bundles carry a @xmath12 structure .",
    "this is no restriction , since every associative submanifold has this structure , but if we require that their deformations be compatible with the background connection we must have an integrability condition , i.e. the condition that the connection on their normal bundles ( induced by the @xmath1 background metric ) reduce to a @xmath12 connection .",
    "we call such manifolds _ integrable complex associative submanifolds_. the prototype of these manifolds are holomorphic curves crossed by circles inside of @xmath13",
    ". we do nt know how abundant these manifolds are in general .",
    "one natural way to remove this restriction is to use a generalized version of the seiberg - witten theory @xcite , the drawback of this is that it is a harder theory where we do nt have automatic compactness .",
    "there is a more general class of submanifolds , namely the associative submanifolds whose normal bundles carry a @xmath14 structure .",
    "this structure allows us to break the normal bundle into pair of complex bundles , define necessary dirac operator between them , and perform the deformations in these bundles via the standard seiberg - witten theory . in this case",
    "we do nt have a connection compatibility problem , because we perform the deformation in a larger space by using the whole background connection with the help of an auxiliary connection .",
    "more naturally , we can define @xmath12 or @xmath14 structures on a @xmath1 manifold itself , and induce them to all if its associative submanifolds .",
    "we can also define global equations on the @xmath15-dimensional associative grassmannian bundle over a @xmath1 manifold @xmath16 , such a way that they restrict to the above mentioned seiberg - witten equations on each of its associative submanifold @xmath17 .",
    "we would like to thank g. tian and r.bryant for many valuable comments , and also thank r. kirby for constant encouragement .",
    "here we give some basic definitions and known facts concerning the manifolds with special holonomy , the reader can find all these interesting facts about them in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the exceptional lie group @xmath18 can be defined as the subgroup of @xmath19 fixing a particular @xmath20-form @xmath21 .",
    "denote @xmath22 , then @xmath23 @xmath24 a smooth @xmath25-manifold @xmath2 has a _",
    "@xmath18 structure _ if its tangent frame bundle reduces to a @xmath18 bundle .",
    "equivalently @xmath2 has a _",
    "@xmath18 structure _ if it has a 3-form @xmath26 such that at each @xmath27 the pair @xmath28 is isomorphic to @xmath29 .",
    "in fact @xmath18 is a @xmath30-dimensional subgroup of @xmath31 . since @xmath19 acts on @xmath32 with stabilizer @xmath18 ,",
    "its orbit @xmath33 is open for dimension reasons , so the choice of @xmath34 in the above definition is generic .",
    "in fact the action of @xmath35 has two orbits containing @xmath36 .",
    "the set of smooth @xmath25-manifolds with @xmath18-structures coincides with the set of @xmath25-manifolds with spin structure , though this correspondence is not @xmath37 .",
    "this is because @xmath38 acts on @xmath39 with stabilizer @xmath18 inducing the fibrations @xmath40 and hence there is no obstruction to lifting maps @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the cotangent frame bundle @xmath43 of a manifold with @xmath18 structure @xmath44 can be expressed as @xmath45 , where each fiber is given by : @xmath46    it turns out that any @xmath18 structure @xmath11 on @xmath2 gives an orientation @xmath47 on @xmath3 , and in turn @xmath48 determines a metric @xmath49 on @xmath3 , and a cross product structure @xmath50 on its tangent bundle of @xmath3 as follows : let @xmath51 denote the interior product with a vector @xmath52 , then @xmath53/\\mu\\ ] ] @xmath54    to emphasize the dependency on @xmath9 sometimes @xmath55 is denoted by @xmath56 .",

    "a manifold with @xmath18 structure @xmath44 is called a _ @xmath18 manifold _ if the holonomy group of the levi - civita connection ( of the metric @xmath56 ) lies inside of @xmath57 .",
    "equivalently @xmath44 is a @xmath18 manifold if @xmath58 ( i.e. @xmath11 harmonic ) .    in short",
    "one can define a @xmath18 manifold to be any riemannian manifold @xmath59 whose holonomy group is contained in @xmath18 ; then @xmath9 and the cross product @xmath50 come as a consequence .",
    "it turns out that the condition @xmath11 being harmonic is equivalent to the condition that at each point @xmath60 there is a chart such that @xmath61 .",
    "for example if @xmath62 is a complex 3-dimensional calabi - yau manifold with khler form @xmath63 and a nowhere vanishing holomorphic 3-form @xmath64 , then @xmath65 has holonomy group @xmath66 , hence is a @xmath1 manifold . in this case",
    "@xmath11= re @xmath67 .",
    "a 3-dimensional submanifold @xmath4 of a @xmath1 manifold @xmath68 is called _ associative submanifold _ if @xmath69 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the tangent bundle valued 3-form defined by the identity : @xmath72 the equivalence of these conditions follows from the ` associator equality ' of @xcite @xmath73 we will denote the tangent bundle valued @xmath20-form in @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath34 by @xmath75 . throughout this paper",
    "we will denote the sections of a bundle @xmath76 by @xmath77 or simply by @xmath78 , and the bundle valued @xmath79-forms by @xmath80 .",
    "we will denote the coframe bundle by @xmath43 and its adapted frame bundle by @xmath81 .",
    "they can be @xmath18 or @xmath31 frame bundles ; when needed we will specify them by the notations @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the grassmann manifold of oriented @xmath20-planes in @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath2 be any smooth @xmath25-manifold , and let @xmath85 be the @xmath20-planes in @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 is the bundle of grassmannians over @xmath3 defined by @xmath88    let @xmath89 be the universal @xmath90 bundle , and @xmath91 be the dual @xmath92 bundle .",
    "hence @xmath93 is just the tangent bundle @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 extend fiberwise to give bundles @xmath97 , @xmath98 respectively , and let @xmath99 denote the dual of @xmath100 .",
    "notice that @xmath101 is just the bundle of vertical vectors @xmath102 of @xmath103 , i.e. it is the bundle of tangent vectors to the fibers of @xmath104 .",
    "hence @xmath105    let @xmath106 be the @xmath107 frame bundle of the vector bundle @xmath108 , and identify @xmath109 with the quaternions @xmath110 , and identify @xmath111 with the unit quaternions @xmath112 .",
    "recall that @xmath107 is the equivalence classes of pairs @xmath113 $ ] of unit quaternions @xmath114 hence @xmath115 is the associated vector bundle to @xmath116 via the @xmath107 representation @xmath117 there is a pair of @xmath118 bundles over @xmath85 corresponding to the left and right @xmath119 reductions of @xmath107 , so they are given by the @xmath119 representations @xmath120 the map @xmath121 gives actions @xmath122 ; by combining we can think of it as one conjugation action @xmath123    if the @xmath107 bundle @xmath98 lifts to a @xmath124 bundle ( locally it does ) , we get two additional bundles over @xmath85 @xmath125    which gives @xmath108 as a tensor product of two quaternionic line bundles @xmath126 . in particular @xmath127 and @xmath128 ,",
    "i.e. they are the @xmath119 reductions of the @xmath111 bundles @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "in particular there is multiplication map @xmath131 .",
    "now consider the _",
    "grassmannian of associative @xmath20-planes _ @xmath132 in @xmath133 , consisting of elements @xmath134 with the property @xmath135 ( or equivalently @xmath136 ) . @xmath1 acts on @xmath132 transitively with the stabilizer @xmath107 , giving the the identification @xmath137 .",
    "identify the imaginary octonions @xmath138 , then the action of the subgroup @xmath139 on @xmath74 is given by : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the projection of the first factor ( @xcite ) .",
    "now let @xmath2 be a @xmath1 manifold .",
    "as above , this time we can construct the bundle of associative grassmannians over @xmath3 @xmath142 which is just the quotient bundle @xmath143 . as in the previous section , the universal bundles @xmath144 induce @xmath20 and @xmath145 plane bundles @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( i.e. restricting the universal bundles from @xmath148 ) .",
    "also    @xmath149    so , in this associative case , we have an important identification @xmath150 ( as bundles over @xmath151 ) . for simplicity we will denote @xmath152 . as before we have an action @xmath153 , and the similar action of @xmath154 on @xmath108 .",
    "we will break the dual of this last action into a pair of clifford multiplications on @xmath155 @xmath156 given by @xmath157 and @xmath158 , on @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively . by writing @xmath161",
    "we can extend this to an action of the whole exterior algebra @xmath162 .",
    "for example @xmath163 gives @xmath164    recall @xmath165 is the the subbundle of vertical vectors of @xmath166 .",
    "the total space @xmath167 of the normal bundle of the imbedding @xmath168 should be thought of an open tubular neighborhood of @xmath169 in @xmath85 , and it has a nice description :    ( @xcite ) the normal bundle @xmath170 of @xmath168 is isomorphic to @xmath108 , and the bundle of vertical vectors @xmath171 of @xmath172 is the kernel of the clifford multiplication @xmath173 .",
    "hence we have @xmath174 ; from the exact sequence over @xmath175 @xmath176    the quotient bundle , @xmath177 is isomorphic to @xmath170 . also , if @xmath178 is a local orthonormal basis for @xmath179 , then the projection @xmath180 is given by @xmath181    the lemma holds since the lie algebra inclusion @xmath182 is given by @xmath183 where @xmath184 is @xmath185 , and @xmath186 is @xmath187 .",
    "so the tangent space inclusion of @xmath188 is given by the matrix @xmath189 . and",
    "if we write @xmath189 as column vectors @xmath190 , then @xmath191 ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    "any imbedding of a @xmath20-manifold @xmath192 induces a bundle @xmath193 with fibers @xmath84 , and the gauss map of @xmath194 canonically lifts to an imbedding @xmath195 : @xmath196 also , the pull - backs @xmath197 and @xmath198 give the tangent and normal bundles of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath194 is an imbedding as an associative submanifold in a @xmath1 manifold @xmath199 , then the image of @xmath200 lands in @xmath169 . we will denote this canonical lifting of any @xmath20-manifold @xmath201 by @xmath202 .",
    "@xmath169 can be thought of as a universal space parametrizing associative submanifolds of @xmath3 . in particular , if @xmath203 is the lifting of an associative submanifold , by pulling back we see that the principal @xmath107 bundle @xmath204 induces an @xmath107-bundle @xmath205 , and gives the following vector bundles over @xmath4 via the representations : @xmath206 where @xmath207\\in so(4)$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath208 and @xmath209 , where @xmath210 . also we can identify @xmath211 with @xmath212 by the induced metric .",
    "we have the actions @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 from above .",
    "by combining them we can define an action of the bundle valued differential forms @xmath216    for example , if @xmath217 , and @xmath218 , and @xmath219 then @xmath220    let @xmath221 be the determinant ( real ) line bundle .",
    "note that the definition ( 4 ) implies that @xmath222 maps every oriented @xmath20-plane in @xmath223 to its complementary subspace , so @xmath224 gives a bundle map @xmath225 over @xmath85 , which is a section of @xmath226 also , @xmath100 being an oriented bundle implies @xmath227 is trivial so @xmath228 actually gives a section @xmath229 clearly @xmath230 is the codimension @xmath145 submanifold given as the zeros of this section .",
    "so associative submanifolds @xmath201 are characterized by the condition @xmath231 , where @xmath202 is the canonical lifting of @xmath4 .",
    "similarly @xmath9 defines a map @xmath232 .",
    "in general , the normal bundle @xmath210 of any orientable @xmath20-manifold @xmath4 in a @xmath1 manifold @xmath16 has a spin(4 ) structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath111 bundles @xmath233 and @xmath8 over @xmath4 ( the pull - backs of @xmath129 and @xmath234 in ( 9 ) ) such that @xmath235 , with @xmath119 reductions @xmath236 and @xmath237 . note that @xmath238 is also the bundle of endomorphisms @xmath239 . if @xmath4 is associative , then the @xmath111 bundle @xmath233 reduces to @xmath240 i.e. @xmath233 becomes the spinor bundle of @xmath4 , and so @xmath241 becomes a twisted spinor bundle on @xmath4 .",
    "the levi - civita connection of the @xmath18 metric of @xmath242 induces connections on the associated bundles @xmath108 and @xmath100 on @xmath85 .",
    "in particular it induces connections on the tangent and normal bundles of any submanifold @xmath243 .",
    "we will call these connections the _ background connections_. let @xmath244 be the induced connection on the normal bundle @xmath245 . from the lie algebra decomposition @xmath246 , we can write @xmath247 , where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are connections on @xmath233 and @xmath8 respectively",
    ".    let @xmath250 and @xmath251 be the set of connections on the bundles @xmath233 and @xmath8 . hence connections @xmath252 , @xmath253 are in the form @xmath254 , @xmath255 , where @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "so @xmath258 parametrizes connections on @xmath233 and @xmath8 , and the connections on @xmath241 are in the form @xmath259 . to emphasize the dependency on @xmath260 and @xmath261 we will sometimes denote @xmath262 , and @xmath263 .",
    "now , let @xmath17 be any smooth manifold .",
    "we can express the covariant derivative @xmath264 on @xmath96 by @xmath265 , where @xmath266 and @xmath267 are orthonormal tangent and cotangent frame fields of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "furthermore if @xmath4 is an associative submanifold , we can use the clifford multiplication ( 12 ) to form the twisted dirac operator @xmath268 @xmath269 the sections lying in the kernel of this operator are usually called harmonic spinors twisted by @xmath270",
    ". elements of the kernel of @xmath271 are called the harmonic spinors twisted by @xmath8 , or just the twisted harmonic spinors .",
    "there is an interesting class of associative submanifolds which we call _ complex associative _ , they are defined as follows : the subgroups @xmath272 , from @xmath273    give a @xmath12-principal bundle @xmath274 .",
    "note that @xmath275 is the total space of an @xmath276 bundle @xmath277 .",
    "this is just the sphere bundle of the @xmath278-bundle @xmath279 .",
    "so we can identify the unit sections @xmath280 with complex structures on @xmath108 , i.e. the right reductions of @xmath107 to @xmath12 , where @xmath281    just as @xmath107 is the stabilizer subgroup of the action of @xmath18 on @xmath282 , the subgroup @xmath283 is the stabilizer of the action of @xmath18 on the `` framed '' version of @xmath282 .",
    "that is , if @xmath284 is the dual universal bundle , then the action of @xmath18 on @xmath285 extends to an action to the sphere bundle of @xmath286 with stabilizer @xmath12 .    by the representations of @xmath12 induced from @xmath107 we can form the same vector bundles @xmath287 on @xmath288 as in sections ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . except in this case",
    "we have @xmath289 and hence @xmath290 becomes the trivial bundle , and @xmath108 becomes a @xmath291 bundle . the reduction @xmath292 gives an extra line bundle @xmath227 via the representation @xmath293 ( the determinant line bundle of @xmath108 ) .",
    "similarly we have the same actions of ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) .",
    "since @xmath290 is trivial its action becomes the multiplication with complex numbers . in this case",
    "we have a useful quadratic bundle map @xmath294 given by @xmath295 in particular if @xmath296 ( octonions ) , we have @xmath297 .",
    "so if @xmath298 is an associative submanifold , and @xmath299 is the lifting of its gauss map , then the normal bundle of @xmath194 has a @xmath12 structure if and only if @xmath200 lifts @xmath300    as before we get @xmath301 and @xmath302 , plus a line bundle @xmath303 , and @xmath96 becomes a complex @xmath12 bundle , which we will call @xmath304 .",
    "so @xmath304 is the spinor bundle @xmath305 of a @xmath306 structure on @xmath4 , and @xmath307 is its determinant bundle . if this @xmath308 structure comes from a @xmath309 structure , then @xmath310 where @xmath233 is the spinor bundle on @xmath4 .",
    "so in concrete terms :    a _ complex associative submanifold _ @xmath311 of a @xmath1 manifold @xmath3 is an associative manifold in @xmath3 with a unit section @xmath312 , where @xmath210 .",
    "note that the normal bundle @xmath313 of any associative submanifold @xmath4 has a @xmath12 structure ( in fact it is trivial @xcite ) , so liftings to @xmath151 always exists . we will call any @xmath4 with such a lifting a _ complex associative submanifold_.",
    "but for such a lifting the background @xmath107 connection @xmath244 on @xmath210 may not reduce to a @xmath12 connection .",
    "let @xmath314 be the unit section describing the @xmath12 structure on @xmath241 .",
    "then @xmath244 reduces to a @xmath12 connection if @xmath315 , where @xmath248 is the connection on @xmath316 induced from the background connection @xmath244 , and @xmath317 is the covariant differentiation . @xmath318    an _ integrable complex associative submanifold _",
    "@xmath311 of a @xmath1 manifold @xmath3 is an associative manifold in @xmath3 with a unit section @xmath312 with @xmath315 .",
    "a natural way to obtain complex associative submanifolds is by pulling back a universal complex structure from the ambient @xmath1 manifold @xmath44 :    @xmath319 is called a _",

    "then @xmath321 where @xmath322 is a connection on @xmath323 and @xmath248 is a connection on the line bundle @xmath307 .",
    "we can deform the background connection @xmath324 , where @xmath325 , where @xmath326 ( e.g. sec 8) .    recall that if @xmath62 is a complex 3-dimensional calabi - yau manifold then @xmath327 is a @xmath1 manifold , where @xmath11= re @xmath67 .",
    "the submanifolds of the form @xmath328 where @xmath329 a holomorphic curve , are examples of integrable complex associative submanifolds of @xmath330 .",
    "in @xcite mclean showed that , in a neighborhood of an associative submanifold @xmath4 in a @xmath1 manifold @xmath242 , the space of associative submanifolds can be identified with the harmonic spinors on @xmath4 twisted by @xmath8 .",
    "since the cokernel of the dirac operator can vary , we can not determine the dimension of its kernel ( it always has zero index on @xmath331 ) .",
    "we will remedy this by deforming @xmath4 in a larger class of submanifolds . to motivate our approach",

    "so the covariant derivative lifts normal vector fields @xmath52 of @xmath201 to vertical vector fields @xmath337 in @xmath338 .",
    "we want the normal vector fields @xmath52 of @xmath4 to always move @xmath4 in the class of associative submanifolds of @xmath3 , i.e. we want the liftings @xmath339 of the nearby copies @xmath340 of @xmath4 ( pushed off by the vector field @xmath52 ) to lie in @xmath341 upstairs , i.e. we want the component of @xmath337 in the direction of the normal bundle @xmath342 to vanish . by lemma 1 , this means @xmath343 should be in the kernel of the clifford multiplication @xmath344 , i.e. @xmath345        here @xmath346 is the dirac operator induced by the background connection @xmath244 , which is the composition @xmath347    to sum up what we have done : let @xmath348 be an associative manifold in a @xmath1 manifold , and @xmath349 be its canonical lifting . by using the metric connection ,",

    "now ( 28 ) becomes @xmath379 which can be thought of the derivative of a similarly defined map @xmath380        in each slice @xmath367 , we are deforming along normal vector fields by the connection @xmath381 ( which is a perturbation of the background connection @xmath244 ) . to get compactness we can cut down the moduli space by an additional equation as in seiberg - witten theory , i.e. @xmath382 @xmath383    where @xmath384 is the curvature of the connection @xmath385 in @xmath307 . for convenience",
    "we will replace the second equation above by @xmath386 , where @xmath387 is the star operator on @xmath4 and @xmath388 .",
    "now we proceed exactly as in the seiberg - witten theory of @xmath20-manifolds ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to obtain smoothness on the zeros of @xmath356 , we perturb the equations by @xmath389-forms @xmath390 .",
    "this gives a new parametrized equation @xmath391 @xmath392 @xmath393    it follows that in particular @xmath394 must be coclosed .",
    "@xmath395 has a linearization : @xmath396 @xmath397    we see that @xmath398 is smooth and the projection @xmath399 is onto , so by sard s theorem for a generic choice of @xmath394 we can make @xmath400 smooth , where @xmath401 .",
    "the normal bundle of @xmath4 has a complex structure , so the gauge group @xmath402 acts on the solution set @xmath403 , and makes the quotient @xmath404 a smooth zero - dimensional manifold .",
    "this is because the infinitesimal action of @xmath405 on the complex @xmath406 is given by the map @xmath407 where @xmath408 .",
    "so after dividing by @xmath409 , tangentially the complex @xmath410 becomes @xmath411 hence the index of this complex is the sum of the indicies of the dirac operator @xmath412 ( which is zero ) , and the index of the following complex @xmath413 given by @xmath414 , which is also zero , since @xmath331 has zero euler characteristic .",
    "furthermore @xmath415 is compact and oriented ( by seiberg - witten theory ) .",
    "hence we can assign a number @xmath416 to a complex associative submanifold @xmath4 in a @xmath1 manifold .",
    "here we do nt worry about metric dependence of @xmath416 , since we have a fixed background metric induced from the @xmath1 structure .",
    "in particular such a @xmath4 moves in an unobstructed way after perturbation , not in the sections of its normal bundle @xmath417 , but in @xmath418 that lies over it .",
    "so we have :    let @xmath371 be a complex associative submanifold of a @xmath1 manifold @xmath419 .",
    "deformation space of @xmath4 , given by equations ( 32 ) , can be perturbed to a zero dimensional compact smooth oriented manifold , so we can associate a number @xmath420 .",
    "we can generalize the deformations in section 8 without the  complex associative \" hypothesis ( i.e. without the assumption that @xmath8 reduces to a line bundle ) .",
    "we can do this is by coupling the dirac equation ( 25 ) with a curvature equation similar to the second equation of ( 32 ) we get a generalized version of seiberg - witten theory @xcite ( so called @xmath119-monopoles ) , in which case we get a similar deformation picture as in section 8 ( figure 2 ) , but since technically this theory is much more complicated , instead we will put a slight topological restriction on @xmath3 , which will bring @xmath14 structures into the picture and allow us to do the deformations in the associated bundles in an easier way by using only the standard seiberg - witten theory . also , we will first work globally on @xmath175 rather than studying deformations locally at each submanifold .",
    "then at each given associative submanifold @xmath201 , we can localize this global deformations to get local deformations .",
    "let @xmath44 be a @xmath1 manifold .",
    "now suppose the @xmath107 bundle @xmath421 lifts to a @xmath14 bundle @xmath422 , call such a @xmath44 a _",
    "@xmath1 manifold with @xmath14 structure_. since @xmath423 a lifting exists if the stiefel - whitney class @xmath424 is an integral class , and the number of different liftings , i.e. @xmath425 structures , on @xmath108 is given by @xmath426 .",
    "these facts follow from the fibrations : @xmath427    @xmath428 gives the following vector bundles by the representations , for @xmath429 \\in spin^{c}(4)$ ] : @xmath430 @xmath431 are pair of @xmath432 bundles that reduce to @xmath278 bundles @xmath433 , and @xmath227 is a complex line bundle , and @xmath434 .",
    "clearly @xmath435 , and @xmath436 .",
    "recall that if we restrict to @xmath175 we get an additional identifications @xmath437 .",
    "also the @xmath425 structure on @xmath108 gives a @xmath425 structure on the @xmath90 bundle @xmath438 , which can be identifed as an equivalence class of a non - vanishing vector field @xmath439 on @xmath438 , call this the basic section of @xmath438 .",
    "recall that @xmath440 , and @xmath441 .",
    "let @xmath442 be the basic section .",
    "we can define an action @xmath443 , i.e. @xmath444 for @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 , @xmath448 , let @xmath449 and @xmath450 where @xmath451 . from ( 38 )",
    "it is easy to check that this is a dirac action , i.e. @xmath452 . as usual we can dualize and extend this to an action @xmath453      now let @xmath456 be the space of connections on @xmath227 .",
    "let @xmath244 be a given background connection on @xmath108 ( e.g. the one induced from the @xmath1 metric on @xmath3 ) .",
    "than any @xmath457 along with @xmath244 determines a connection on @xmath422 and hence connections all the above associated bundles .",
    "also if we fix @xmath458 , any other @xmath457 can be written as @xmath459 where @xmath460 .",
    "hence for each @xmath457 we get the corresponding dirac operator @xmath461 on bundles @xmath462 which is the composition : @xmath463    we can now write generalized seiberg - witten equations on @xmath151 in the usual way @xmath464 @xmath465 and proceed as in section 8",
    ". equations ( 40 ) imply @xmath466 is closed . by perturbing the equations @xmath467 by closed @xmath468-forms @xmath469 of @xmath470 , i.e. by changing @xmath471 to @xmath472    where @xmath473 we can make @xmath474 smooth .",
    "that is , by applying sard s theorem to the projection @xmath475 for generic choice of @xmath476 we can make @xmath477 smooth , where @xmath478 .",
    "the normal bundle of @xmath4 has a complex structure , so the gauge group @xmath479 acts on the solution set @xmath480 , and makes quotient @xmath481 smooth .",
    "the linearization of @xmath356 ( modulo the gauge group ) is given by the complex @xmath482 which is the sum of the dirac operator @xmath483 with zero index , and a complex which is not elliptic : @xmath484      normal bundle of any associative @xmath485 in a @xmath1 manifold with a @xmath14 structure @xmath486 , pulls back the @xmath14 structure @xmath487 by the canonical lifting @xmath488 .",
