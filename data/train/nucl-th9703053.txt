    "we report on a theoretical calculation of the electromagnetic form - factors of the nucleon in the space - like region , performed in the framework of an effective model  the chiral color - dielectric model ( cdm ) @xcite  in which the nucleon is described as a chiral soliton .",
    "the model contains quark and meson degrees of freedom and a phenomenological scalar field which is responsible for quark confinement .    in the previous calculations of the form factors in the framework of the chiral soliton models of the nucleon , as the linear sigma model @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , the skyrme model @xcite and the cdm @xcite , it was always assumed that the nucleon is at rest before and after the interaction with the virtual photon , the so - called static approximation . in the present work we overcome , at least in part , the technical difficulties associated with the computation of the form factors when the nucleon initial and final states are eigenfunctions of linear momentum , at least non relativistically .",
    "our formalism is a generalization of the one presented in a work by neuber _",
    "@xcite , where _ static _ properties of the nucleon have been computed in the framework of the cdm . in their case",
    "therefore it was enough to build eigenstates of the angular momentum having _ zero _ linear momentum .",
    "the main technical problem in our calculation is due to the non - commutativity of the projectors on linear and on angular momentum .",
    "it will be shown that the problem can be solved by taking a suitable average on the direction of the transfered momentum , as it is suggested by the equation @xmath2=0 $ ] .",
    "morover it will be shown that the fourier transform of the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current does not depend on the direction of the momentum transfered , if nucleon states are considered .",
    "therefore the integration on @xmath3 does not imply any approximation .",
    "the use of the _ effective commutativity _ of the two projectors simplifies the computation of the doubly projected form factors .",
    "these mathematical aspects are applicable in general to any quark - meson chiral soliton model .",
    "the numerical results shown in this paper refer to the electric and the magnetic proton and neutron form factors computed in a particular version of the chiral cdm .",
    "this is the so - called  single minimum \" version which gives good results in quark matter calculations @xcite .",
    "the model contains two parameters that we adjust in order to reproduce the average @xmath4@xmath5 mass and the isoscalar nucleon radius .",
    "all other results are obtained without any further parameters fitting .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the electromagnetic form - factors are defined . in section 3",
    "we review the chiral color - dielectric model and the way model states representing a nucleon with definite momentum are obtained .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the formalism to compute the electric and the magnetic form factors of the nucleon in the projected hedgehog state .",
    "finally , in section 5 , the results are presented and discussed .",
    "let @xmath6 represent a nucleon state of mass @xmath7 , with spin and isospin described by @xmath8 .",
    "the standard definition of the electromagnetic form factors is given by : j^_em(0 ) = |u_f(p_)f_1(q_^2)^+ if_2(q_^2)2m_n^q_u_i(p _ ) .",
    "[ 21 ] they only depend on the modulus of the momentum transfer of the virtual photon @xmath9 , being real functions of @xmath10 .",
    "we work in the breit frame where the photon 4-momentum is @xmath11 , i.e. the energy transfer is zero .",
    "our results will be presented as a function of @xmath12 .    in the breit frame , eq .",

[ 27 ]    from @xmath14 and @xmath15 it is usual to define the so - called sachs form factors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for  electric \" and  magnetic \" respectively , which are expressed by g_e(q^2)&=&f_1(q^2)-q^24m_n^2  f_2(q^2 ) [ 28 ] + g_m(q^2)&=&f_1(q^2)+ f_2(q^2 ) .",

    "in this work we shall use a chiral version of the cdm , whose lagrangian reads @xcite & = & i|q^_q + g |q(_o + i_5 ) q + 12(_)^2 -v ( ) + & + & 12(__o ) ^2 + 12(_)^2 -u(_o , ) . [",

    "we consider the quadratic form v()=12",
    "m^2 ^2 , [ 33 ] where @xmath19 is the @xmath22 mass .",
    "it is well known that the chiral cdm allows for soliton solutions in which the quarks are absolutely confined @xcite . in such solutions",
    "the @xmath22 mean field is a decreasing function of the distance , approaching zero in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "this generates a raising dynamical mass for the quarks and confines them . in",
    "previous works an exhaustive study of the model with a quartic ( or ` double minimum ' ) potential was carried out @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider just the quadratic ( ` single minimum ' ) potential for the confining field .",
    "we recently showed @xcite that for ` double minimum ' potentials and for all sets of parameters fitting nucleon properties , the equation of state for quark matter turns out to be unrealistic . indeed even at very low density the energy _ per _",
    "baryon number for quark matter turns out to be smaller than that for nuclear matter . using instead",
    "a quadratic potential for the @xmath22 field a realistic equation of state is obtained .",

    "the nucleon we used the procedure explained in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite which , for the sake of completeness , is sketched here .",
    "we consider three valence quarks in the hedgehog state @xmath35 , all occupying the same lowest positive energy s - orbital and surrounded by clouds of @xmath22 , sigmas and pions , described by coherent states ( @xmath36 , for pions ; @xmath37 , for sigmas ; and @xmath38 , for the confining field ) .",
    "the meson mean fields are the expectation values of the field operators in the corresponding coherent states .",
    "we can write the quark single particle states and the meson mean fields as & & r q= 1 [ 34 ] + & & _ o ( r ) = - f_=(r ) -f_[35 ] + & & ( r ) = = rr(r ) [ 36 ] + & & ( r ) = = ( r ) , [ 37 ] where @xmath39 is just the fluctuating part of the @xmath20 field . altogether",
    ", the hedgehog ansatz reads _ hh= ( c_h^)^3 , [ 38 ] where @xmath40 creates a particle in the single quark state ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "of course , solitons described by the hedgehog",
    "@xmath41 can not represent physical baryons because they are not eigenstates of angular momentum or isospin .",
    "in addition , ( [ 38 ] ) represents a localized object and therefore the translational symmetry of the model hamiltonian is also broken in such states .",
    "in particular they contain spurious centre - of - mass components which contribute to the energy and to the other observables .",
    "however , a nucleon at rest can be obtained by applying the projector onto linear momentum @xmath42 together with the projector onto angular momentum - isospin .",
    "the linear momentum projector is given by @xcite p_q = ( 12)^3 a e^u(a ) , [ 39 ] where @xmath43 is the translation operator .",
    "it is well known that due to the symmetry of the hedgehog it is enough to perform a single projection ( e.g. onto spin ) , since this automatically projects onto the same value of isospin .",
    "the operator which projects out from the hedgehog a state with angular momentum @xmath44 and isospin @xmath45 is p_mm_t^j=(-1)^j+m_t 2j+18 ^ 2 ^3d^j^ * _ m ,- m_t()r ( ) , [ 310 ] where @xmath46 are the three euler angles , @xmath47 are the wigner functions and @xmath48 is the rotation operator . in the following we will consider @xmath49 and use the shorthand notation @xmath50 .",
    "the radial functions in ( [ 34])-([37 ] ) are determined using an approximate variation - after - projection method firstly suggested by leech and birse @xcite .",
    "they are computed by minimizing the expectation value of the ( normal - ordered ) model hamiltonian in the model baryon state with quantum numbers @xmath51 and linear momentum zero : p_q=0p_jm_hh= j , t , m , q=0 . [ 311 ]    in the model there are two parameters , @xmath34 and @xmath19 , yet to be fixed . however , because of the smoothness of the @xmath22-field in a typical soliton solution and of the relative weakness of the chiral meson clouds , the relevant parameter turns out to be @xmath52 . in the quark matter sector",
    "this is indeed the only free parameter of the model @xcite .",
    "if @xmath53 is fixed to reproduce the isoscalar radius of the nucleon one obtains @xmath54 gev . for this parameter the nucleon - delta average mass is around 1.13 gev ( experimental value 1.085 gev ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that if @xmath34 and @xmath19 are changed , keeping @xmath53 fixed , the static properties of the nucleon are essentially unchanged .",
    "for example , for @xmath55 gev , changing the mass of the @xmath22 field in the range 0.82.0 gev , affects the results by less than 1% .    in the present version of the cdm , the nucleon - delta mass splitting results only from the quark - pion interaction . due to the weakness of the pionic field ,",
    "the nucleon delta mass splitting obtained is too small .",
    "the experimental value of the splitting could be recovered if , in addition , a color - magnetic interaction ( like in the mit bag model or in the cloudy bag model ) was considered @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point in the conclusions .",
    "in order to compute the electromagnetic nucleon form factors one has to evaluate matrix elements of the electromagnetic current operator . in the cdm the latter",
    "is given by j^_em ( x ) = : _",
    "a=1 ^ 3 |q_a(x)^ ( 16+_32)q_a(x)+ [ ( x)^(x)]_3 : .[312 ]    as mentioned in the introduction , in the past the matrix elements of this operator have been computed in the _ static _",
    "approximation ( the nucleon is assumed to be at rest _ before _ and _ after _ the interaction with the photon ) . in the present work",
    "we go beyond this approximation , since we compute the matrix elements using momentum eigenstates . in principle",
    "these should be obtained by boosting @xcite the nucleon zero momentum eigenstate ( [ 311 ] ) .",
    "however , the technical difficulties associated with boosting are prohibitive .",
    "we approximate this operation by a peierls - yoccoz projection , i.e. we consider our model state with momentum @xmath56 to be given by    n ( q ) , [ 313 ] where the square roots are just normalization factors and _",
    "jm= p_jm_hh .",
    "the approximation involved in assuming projected instead of boosted states is valid for small @xmath57 .    before presenting the formalism to compute the form factors as matrix elements of the electromagnetic current ( [ 312 ] ) taken between nucleon states ,",
    "let us recall that = 0 , [ theo ] if @xmath58 is a scalar function of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this can be seen writing explicitly the commutator , rotating the argument of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and redefining @xmath62 .",
    "the previous commutation relation will be very useful in the following .",
    "another important point is that , due to the symmetry of the hedgehog , rotations of this state in spin or isospin space are equivalent .",
    "therefore , as it was already pointed out in the previous section , projecting the hedgehog onto spin @xmath44 implies a simultaneous projection onto isospin @xmath45 , and the two projections are equivalent .",
    "hence , the following relations hold : p_q p_jm_hh>= p_q p_tm_hh>= p_tm p_q_hh > p_jm p_q_hh > , [ commut ] where the commutation between operators working in isospin space and operators working in ordinary space has been used .",
    "the projector @xmath63 is defined similarly to the projector @xmath64 ( eq . ( [ 310 ] ) ) , but with the rotation operator @xmath65 acting in isospin space , replacing the rotation operator in spin space .",
    "we shall exploit relations ( [ commut ] ) in the evaluation of the magnetic form factors .      from the definition of the electric form factor ( [ 210 ] ) and using the correspondence ( [ 313 ] ) , the electric form - factor is given by g_e(q^2)= , and using the explicit form of the linear momentum projector ( [ 39 ] ) one obtains g_e(q^2)= .    in principle",
    "the form factors should be functions of @xmath66 only .",
    "however , due to the approximate treatment of the center - of - mass motion this is in general no longer guaranteed and there is a spurious dependence on the angle between @xmath67 and the quantization direction .",
    "however , if @xmath68 states are considered , it is possible to show that the form factor is indeed a function of @xmath66 only .",
    "in fact , due to parity , the fourier transform of the matrix element of the current has to be a function of @xmath69 which , for @xmath68 , is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "we can therefore integrate the direction @xmath70 , both in the current matrix element and in the normalization factor at the denominator .",
    "after the expansion of the exponentials in spherical waves , only the @xmath71 wave contributes and one gets g_e(q^2)= .",
    "[ gej ]    the integration on @xmath3 allows for further simplifications .",
    "in fact , we can now prove that the translation operator @xmath72 and the rotation operator @xmath48 , which enters the projector on angular momentum [ eq .",
    "( [ 310 ] ) ] , can be exchanged in the previous formula , although they do nt commute .",
    "let us , first of all , note that u^^(b)j^0_em(0)u(b)= j^0_em(b)u(b - b ) [ uj0 ] and expand the spherical bessel functions @xmath73 in power series of @xmath74 .",
    "notice that the integration on the direction of the momentum transfer has eliminated the dependence of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ gej ] ) on the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath75 . after the introduction of the new variables",

    "( [ theo ] ) to each of the previous terms so that one of the two projectors on angular momentum in eq .",
    "( [ gej ] ) can be eliminated both in the numerator and in the denominator .",

    "the projection operators will therefore always rotate in a non - trivial way the current . to simplify the expression of the magnetic form factor",

    "the effect of the projection on linear momentum is particularly relevant in the proton electric form factor .",

    "since the model does not contain enough tensor force , it provides poor results for observables which involve the spin .",
    "the magnetic form factors are therefore not totally satisfactory and the polarized structure functions overestimate the data @xcite , indicating that most of the spin is carried by the quarks because the pion is very weak .",
