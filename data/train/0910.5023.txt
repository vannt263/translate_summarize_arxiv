    "the identification of the physical mechanisms responsible for the dissipation of turbulence in the solar wind , and for the resulting heating of the solar wind plasma , remains an important and unsolved problem of heliospheric physics .",
    "an important clue to this problem is the observed non - zero fluctuating magnetic helicity signature at scales corresponding to the dissipation range of solar wind turbulence .",
    "@xcite first proposed the `` fluctuating '' magnetic helicity as a diagnostic of solar wind turbulence , defining the `` reduced fluctuating '' magnetic helicity spectrum derivable from observational data ( see  [ sec : red ] below ) . a subsequent study",
    ", corresponding to scales within the inertial range , found values that fluctuated randomly in sign , and suggested an interpretation that `` a substantial degree of helicity or circular polarization exists throughout the wavenumber spectrum , but the sense of polarization or handedness alternates randomly '' @xcite .",
    "based on a study of the fluctuating magnetic helicity of solutions to the linear vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation , @xcite suggested instead that , at inertial range scales , all eigenmodes have a very small _ intrinsic _ normalized fluctuating magnetic helicity , eliminating the need to invoke an ensemble of waves with both left- and right - handed helicity to explain the observations .",
    "subsequent higher time resolution measurements , corresponding to scales in the dissipation range , exhibited a non - zero net reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity signature , with the sign apparently correlated with the direction of the magnetic sector @xcite . assuming dominantly anti - sunward propagating waves , the study concluded that these fluctuations had right - handed helicity .",
    "the proposed interpretation was that left - hand polarized alfvn / ion cyclotron waves were preferentially damped by cyclotron resonance with the ions , leaving undamped right - hand polarized fast / whistler waves as the dominant wave mode in the dissipation range , producing the measured net reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity .",
    "we refer to this as the _ cyclotron damping interpretation_.    a subsequent analysis of more solar wind intervals confirmed these findings for the dissipation range @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that a comparison of the normalized cross - helicity in the inertial range ( as a proxy for the dominant wave propagation direction in the dissipation range ) to the measured normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity provides evidence for the importance of ion cyclotron damping , which would selectively remove the left - hand polarized waves from the turbulence ; using a simple rate balance calculation , they concluded that the ratio of damping by cyclotron resonant to non - cyclotron resonant dissipation mechanisms was of order unity . a recent study performing the same analysis on a much larger data set concurred with this conclusion @xcite .    in this letter , we demonstrate that a dissipation range comprised of kinetic alfvn waves produces a reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity signature consistent with observations .",
    "a dissipation range of this nature results from an anisotropic cascade to high perpendicular wavenumber with @xmath0 ; such a cascade is consistent with existing theories for low - frequency plasma turbulence @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , and observations in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "our results imply that no conclusions can be drawn about the importance of ion cyclotron damping in the solar wind based on the observed magnetic helicity signature alone .",
    "the magnetic helicity is defined as the integral over the plasma volume @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the vector potential which defines the magnetic field via @xmath3 .",
    "this integral is an invariant of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in the absence of a mean magnetic field @xcite .",
    "@xcite chose to set aside the complications associated with the presence of a mean magnetic field , defining the _ fluctuating magnetic helicity _ by @xmath4 , where the fluctuating quantities denoted by @xmath5 do not include contributions from the mean field .    modeling the turbulent magnetic field by @xmath6 in a periodic cube of plasma with volume @xmath7",

    "it is easily shown that this result is invariant to rotation of the wave vector @xmath9 , along with its corresponding linear eigenfunction , about the direction of the mean magnetic field .",
    "the _ normalized fluctuating magnetic helicity density _ is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "this normalized measure has values within the range @xmath19 $ ] , where negative values denote left - handed helicity and positive values denote right - handed helicity .",
    "we numerically calculate @xmath20 over the @xmath21@xmath22 plane for the eigenmodes of the linear vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation @xcite for a proton and electron plasma with an isotropic maxwellian equilibrium distribution function for each species and no drift velocities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the code ) .",
    "the dispersion relation depends on five parameters @xmath23 , for ion larmor radius @xmath24 , ion plasma beta @xmath25 , ion to electron temperature ratio @xmath26 , and ion thermal velocity to the speed of light @xmath27 .",
    "we specify plasma parameters characteristic of the solar wind at 1  au : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mhel ] is a contour plot of @xmath20 obtained by solving for the alfvn wave root over the @xmath21@xmath22 plane , then using the complex eigenfunctions to determine @xmath20 .",
    "the mhd regime corresponds to the lower left corner of the plot , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; here , the alfvn wave with @xmath33 is linearly polarized with @xmath34 . as one moves up vertically on the plot to the regime @xmath35 , the solution becomes left - handed with values of @xmath36 . in this regime of nearly parallel wave vectors , the solution represents alfvn waves in the limit @xmath37 and ion cyclotron waves in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the linear wave mode becomes strongly damped via the ion cyclotron resonance at a value of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the behavior supporting the cyclotron damping interpretation of the measured magnetic helicity in the solar wind .",
    "but the alfvn wave solution does not always produce left - handed magnetic helicity .",
    "if one moves instead from the mhd regime horizontally to the right , the solution becomes right - handed with @xmath39 as @xmath40 , a behavior previously found by @xcite . in this regime of",
    "nearly perpendicular wave vectors with @xmath41 , the solution represents alfvn waves in the limit @xmath32 and kinetic alfvn waves in the limit @xmath42 . thus ,",
    "if the dissipation range is comprised of kinetic alfvn waves , as suggested by theories for critically balanced , low - frequency plasma turbulence @xcite , one would expect to observe a positive normalized fluctuating magnetic helicity signature in that regime .",
    "unfortunately , due to the limitations of single - point satellite measurements , equations  ( [ eq : hm ] )  and  ( [ eq : sigm1 ] ) can not be used directly to calculate the fluctuating magnetic helicity from observations ; approximations must be introduced to define a related measurable quantity . in this section , we calculate the reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity density , as defined by @xcite and used by subsequent authors , for the magnetic field defined by equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) , but without assuming the taylor hypothesis .",
    "the two - point , two - time magnetic field correlation function is @xmath43 where the angle brackets specify an ensemble average , defined here by @xmath44 .",
    "we find @xmath45 where the reality conditions ensure that this quantity is real .",
    "we choose to sample this correlation function at a moving probe with position given by @xmath46 ; this corresponds to satellite measurements of the solar wind , where the probe is stationary and the solar wind is streaming past the probe at velocity @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we may determine the reduced magnetic field correlation function , @xmath48 , obtaining the form @xmath49 the reduced frequency spectrum , defined by @xmath50 , is then given by @xmath51 .",

    "it is clear from this equation that all possible wave vectors @xmath78 that give the same doppler shifted frequency @xmath52 will contribute to the sum for the reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity density at the frequency @xmath52 .",
    "predicting the values of @xmath79 for solar wind turbulence based on equation ( [ eq : hmr ] ) requires understanding three issues : the scaling of the magnetic fluctuation spectrum with wavenumber , the imbalance of alfvn wave energy fluxes in opposite directions along the mean magnetic field , and the variation of the angle @xmath80 between the solar wind velocity @xmath47 and the mean magnetic field .",
    "the 1-d magnetic energy spectrum in the solar wind typically scales as @xmath81 in the inertial range and @xmath82 in the dissipation range , where @xmath83 @xcite and the effective wavenumber is @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear from equation  ( [ eq : hmr ] ) that , when the plasma frame frequency @xmath54 is negligible , the doppler - shifted observed frequency always results in an effective wavenumber @xmath85 , with equality occurring only when the velocity @xmath47 is aligned with the wave vector @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that , for homogeneous turbulence at the dissipation range scales , turbulent energy at fixed @xmath21 and @xmath22 is uniformly spread over wave vectors with all possible angles @xmath73 about the mean magnetic field .",
    "because the fluctuation amplitude deceases for larger effective wavenumbers , the contribution to @xmath79 is maximum at angle @xmath86 ; for angles @xmath73 yielding a doppler shift to lower effective wavenumbers @xmath87 , the higher amplitude fluctuations at those lower wavenumbers will contribute more strongly to @xmath79",

    ". the contributions to @xmath98 for all angles @xmath73 of each wave vector are collected in 120 logarithmically spaced bins in doppler - shifted frequency .",

    "the analysis presented in figure  [ fig : mhelr ] considers only waves with @xmath106 , so all of the waves in the summation in equation  ( [ eq : hmr ] ) are traveling in the same direction . if there were an equal alfvn wave energy flux in the opposite direction  a case of balanced energy fluxes , or zero cross helicity  the net @xmath98 would be zero due to the odd symmetry of @xmath62 in @xmath22 .",
    "it is often observed , at scales corresponding to the inertial range , that the energy flux in the anti - sunward direction dominates , leading to a large normalized cross helicity @xcite .",
    "if this imbalance of energy fluxes persists to the smaller scales associated with the dissipation range , a non - zero value of @xmath98 is expected .",
    "however , theories of imbalanced mhd turbulence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) predict that the turbulence is `` pinned '' to equal values of the oppositely directed energy fluxes at the dissipation scale .",
    "this implies that , at sufficiently high wavenumber @xmath63 , the value of @xmath98 should asymptote to zero .",

    "the underlying assumption of the cyclotron damping interpretation of magnetic helicity measurements , an interpretation that dominates the solar wind literature @xcite , is the slab model , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , i.e. , purely parallel wave vectors . as shown in figure  [ fig : mhel ] , only in the limit @xmath113 does the alfvn wave root generate a left - handed helicity @xmath36 as @xmath114 ; in the same limit , the fast / whistler root generates a right - handed helicity @xmath39 in a quantitatively similar manner ( see figure  9 of @xcite ) .",
