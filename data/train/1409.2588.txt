    ".125 in    the study of finite point configurations in sets of various sizes spans analysis , ergodic theory , number theory and combinatorics . a corollary ( due to steinhaus ) of the lebesgue density theorem states that any measurable set in @xmath7 with positive lebesgue measure contains a similar copy of any finite configuration of points .",
    "there are many variations on this result .",
    "for instance , instead of sets of positive lebesgue measure , one can consider an unbounded set @xmath2 of positive upper lebesgue density , in the sense that @xmath8}^d    \\bigr|}{{(2r)}^d}>0.\\ ] ] here @xmath9 denotes the @xmath10-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "a result of bourgain @xcite ( also furstenberg , katznelson and weiss @xcite ) proves that @xmath4 contains all sufficiently large copies of a non - degenerate @xmath6-simplex , i.e. , a @xmath11-point configuration , for @xmath12 .",
    "ziegler @xcite has generalized this result for @xmath13 , but the sufficiently large copies of the configuration are shown to be contained in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath4 rather than in @xmath4 itself . in particular , results of this type show that we can recover every simplex similarity type inside a subset of @xmath14 that is `` large '' , either in the sense of positive lebesgue measure or of positive upper lebesgue density .",
    "it is reasonable to wonder whether similar conclusions continue to hold even if such largeness assumptions are weakened .",
    "however , the following result due to maga @xcite shows that the conclusion in general fails for lebesgue null sets in @xmath7 , _ even if the set under consideration is of full hausdorff dimension_. let @xmath1 denote the hausdorff dimension of a set @xmath15 .",
    "[ mag10 ] ( maga @xcite ) the following conclusions hold .",
    "a.   for any @xmath3 , there exists a compact set @xmath16 with @xmath17 such that @xmath18 does not contain the vertices of any parallelogram .",
    "b.   if @xmath19 , then given any nondegenerate triple of points @xmath20 in @xmath21 , there exists a compact set @xmath22 with @xmath23 such that @xmath24 does not contain the vertices of any triangle similar to @xmath25 .    in view of maga",
    "s result , it is reasonable to ask whether interesting specific point configurations can be found inside thin sets under additional structural hypotheses . this question has been recently addressed by chan , aba and pramanik @xcite , where the authors establish the existence of certain finite point configurations in sets of sufficiently high hausdorff dimension and carrying a borel measure with decaying fourier transform . ( the measure should also satisfy certain size bounds for euclidean balls . ) the point configurations obtained in @xcite were required to obey appropriate nondegeneracy constraints when expressed as a linear system , and included both geometric and algebraic patterns such as corners in the plane , as well as polynomial - type configurations in @xmath7 .",
    "however , some natural configurations do not satisfy the non - degeneracy assumption of @xcite .",
    "for example , _ corners _ in @xmath26 , defined as collections of @xmath27 points @xmath28 in @xmath29 such that @xmath30 are not covered by the setup of @xcite .",

    "it is reasonable to ask which point configurations can be recovered without extra assumption on the fourier decay . in view of maga",
    "s result ( thm .  [ mag10 ] above ) , one can not hope to prove nontrivial results of this type for configurations that contain a planar loop .",
    "however it still seems plausible that we may be able to handle tree - like point configurations and loops that are not contained in a plane and hence enjoy greater directional freedom .",
    "this question is partially addressed in @xcite . to present this result , we need the following definition .",

    "the lower bound is accomplished using the continuity of the distance measure in appropriate dimensional regimes .",
    "an upper bound is proved using a fractal variant of the classical parseval identity recently established by iosevich , sawyer , taylor and uriarte - tuero @xcite , based on an earlier result of strichartz @xcite . in practice , this amounts to obtaining upper and lower bounds on the quantity @xmath43 that are uniform in @xmath44 . here and throughout the paper",

    "an analogous multilinear form , expressed in terms of the fourier transforms of measures rather than the measures themselves , was used in @xcite as well . there , a finite upper bound on the form justified its existence and definition ; a nontrivial lower bound then established the existence of the linear configurations .",
    "while the results in are focused on point configurations that do not contain loops , we shall see that both the lower bound and the upper bound idea in @xcite , combined with the generalized three - lines lemma approach in @xcite , allow us to capture configurations that were inaccessible by these previous methods .",
