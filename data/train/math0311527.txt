    "the textbook treatment of transverse vibrations of a metallic wire ( string ) , governed by the linear wave equation , does not portray existence of whirling out of plane motion .",
    "the phenomenon was first observed by hunton as reported by harrison @xcite .",
    "the reference to other subsequent experiments can be found in the book by nayfeh and mook @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the whirling motion , sometimes also referred to as _ ballooning motion _",
    "occurs when the amplitude and frequency of a plane excitation and the phase difference between the response and the excitation exceeds certain critical values .",
    "the explanation of the phenomenon lies in a nonlinear treatment of the problem .",
    "long ago kirchoff @xcite , taking longitudinal elasticity also into consideration , gave the following nonlinear integro - differential equation for transverse vibrations confined to a plane :    @xmath0\\,\\fr{\\p^2 u}{\\p x^2},\\quad 0",

    "the constants @xmath6 are respectively the initial axial tension , the mass density , the cross - section area and young s modulus of the string . for treating nonlinear out of plane motion with components @xmath7 in the perpendicular @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions ,",

    "can also be found in nayfeh and mook @xcite .",
    "the book @xcite also refers to other authors who derived different nonlinear differential equations under various assumptions .    for a string fixed at both ends , we have @xmath12 and",
    "if @xmath13 are initial displacement and velocity @xmath14 the existence and uniqueness in the scalar case are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "arosio and spagnola @xcite , gough @xcite and several other authors referred to in nayfeh and mook @xcite have studied the problem ( 1a , b ) from mathematical and physical points of view with a focus on modal analysis and eigenvalues of the system . in particular , anand @xcite has investigated ( 1b ) proving that the vibrations are stable even in the planar case .",
    "the elaborate method of treatment employs stability analysis of the time - dependent hill s equation satisfied by the modal amplitudes . in recent years , shahruz @xcite has treated the problem ( 1a ) with a bounded input disturbance and his result shows boundedness of the ouput .",
    "the approach is systems and control theoretic .",
    "the mathematical theory of stabilisation of distributed parameter systems is currently of interest in view of application to vibration control of various structural elements .",
    "the most common class of vibration control mechanism is of passive type that absorbs vibration energy .",
    "a system is called strongly stable if the total energy @xmath15 of each solution of the system converges to zero as time @xmath16 .",
    "if the convergence is uniform for @xmath17 with respect to all initial data in the energy space for which @xmath18 , the system is called uniformly stable . here our investigation is a direct lyapunov stability approach to obtain uniform exponential energy decay estimate for the system ( 1b ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and establish that the system is a passive energy absorber .",
    "such estimate has earlier been obtained by gorain @xcite for damped linear wave equation in a bounded domain in @xmath19 .",
    "gorain and bose @xcite have obtained such estimates for an internally damped beam governed by linear equations in torsional and flexural modes of vibration .",
    "the total energy at time @xmath20 , of the system ( 1b)(3 ) is defined by the functional @xmath21{\\rm d}x + \\fr{b}{4}\\left[\\int_0^l\\left|\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p x}\\right|^2{\\rm d}x\\right]^2,\\quad t \\ge 0.\\ ] ] diferentiating ( 4 ) with respect to @xmath20 and using the governing equation ( 1b ) we obtain @xmath22{\\rm d}x\\\\[.2pc ] & \\quad\\ + \\left(a^2 + b\\int_0^l\\left|\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p x}\\right|^2{\\rm d}x\\right)\\,\\int_0^l\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p x}\\,\\bd\\,\\fr{\\p^2\\u}{\\p x\\p t}\\;{\\rm d}x\\\\[.2pc ] & = \\left(a^2 + b\\int_0^l\\left|\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p x}\\right|^2{\\rm d}x\\right)\\int_0^l\\fr{\\p}{\\p x}\\left(\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p t}\\,\\bd\\,\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p x}\\right){\\rm d}x - 2\\d\\int_0^l\\left|\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p t}\\right|^2{\\rm d}x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of the first integral vanishes in view of the boundary conditions ( 2 ) .",
    "we thus get @xmath23 the negativity of the right hand side of ( 5 ) shows that the energy @xmath15 is decreasing with time due to the incorporation of passive viscous damping coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "the system is thus non - energy conserving .",
    "naturally the question arises as to whether the system is uniformly stable or not .",
    "an affirmative answer is contained in the following theorem , which essentially states that in fact the energy of vibration has uniform exponential decay .",

    "next , differentiating ( 9 ) with respect to @xmath20 , and using the governing equation ( 1b ) , we obtain @xmath50{\\rm d}x.\\ ] ] integration by parts of the first term yields @xmath51 & \\le -\\,2\\,e(t ) + 2\\int_0^l\\left|\\fr{\\p\\u}{\\p t}\\right|^2{\\rm d}x,\\quad t > 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we now differentiate ( 8) with respect to @xmath20 and then insert the results of ( 5 ) and ( 16 ) , we get @xmath52 and so if we choose @xmath53 , @xmath54 where ( 15 ) has been used . defining @xmath55 the above inequality becomes @xmath56 and so multiplying by @xmath57 and integrating from 0 to @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath58 finally , using ( 15 ) again , we obtain the estimate ( 6 ) where @xmath59 hence the theorem .    in the above we have also obtained exponential energy decay estimate for the solution of the nonlinear damped elastic string for initial conditions @xmath25,\\;\\u_1\\in l^2[\\,0 , l]$ ] .",

    "@xmath65 is the smaller parameter unless the string is very long .",
    "so from the restriction on @xmath61 , we can assume @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath74 will suffice exponential decay of the solution .",

    "thus if we look for steeply falling estimate , the energy gets multiplied many times in the initial stages .",

    "study of nonlinear vibrations assumes significance in analysing slender structural elements capable of withstanding finite deformations .",

    "here we give a simple proof of scheefer s inequality ( 10 ) .",
    "since @xmath84 , we can have a fourier representation @xmath85 assuming term - by - term differentiation holds , @xmath86 applying parseval s theorem to the two series , we get @xmath87 hence the inequality .",
