    "the nature of the 12 bright ( @xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) x - ray sources in globular clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appears distinct from that of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the galaxy as a whole .",
    "that they are lmxbs was established by mass estimates based on their cluster positions , as measured by the _ einstein_/hri @xcite .",
    "however , they are over - abundant by a factor @xmath0100 requiring entirely different formation mechanisms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , studies of the limited number of optical counterparts @xcite imply that their period distribution is also remarkably different from that of field lmxbs , with a preponderance of ultra - short period systems .",
    "ngc6624 harbors the shortest period binary system known ( with @xmath6min ) , and our _ hst _ observations of the x - ray source in ngc6712 @xcite indicated that it too is likely to be a similarly exotic system .",
    "indeed , the only companion to the neutron star primary that can fit into such a compact binary is a white dwarf , making them double degenerates remarkable endpoints to binary stellar evolution .",
    "even given the 3  ( 90% confidence limit ) _ einstein _ x - ray positions , optical identifications are very difficult , due to the extremely crowded locations . in the case of ngc1851 ,",
    "@xcite wfpc2 imaging revealed @xmath0300 stars within the _ einstein _ error circle .",
    "their proposed counterpart , star  a , is a very strong candidate , given its similarity in color ( faintness and large uv - excess ) to the confirmed counterpart in ngc6712 , yet a @xmath05% _ a posteriori _ probability still remained that such a uv - excess star could coincidentally lie within the _ einstein _ x - ray error circle .",
    "furthermore , earlier ground - based work by @xcite suggested that another uv - bright object with colors of a horizontal branch star , x1 , might be an unusual counterpart .",
    "clearly , additional observations were needed to confirm or refute these various suggested identifications .    to that end , we have obtained both _",
    "chandra_/hrc data of the field in order to significantly improve the x - ray position , and a set of time resolved _",
    "fuv - images to search for any variability .",
    "we present the results of these observations in this letter .",
    "_ chandra _ observed the field of x0512 - 401  for 12ks on 1999 december 25 . the high resolution camera + low - energy transmission grating spectrograph mode ( hrc - s+ letg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we chose provides the highest possible spatial resolution available from _ chandra _ , to achieve our primary science goal , but also a high resolution low energy spectrum of the bright source .",
    "the spectral results will be presented elsewhere , whilst we will concentrate on the positional result here .",
    "data reduction was initially undertaken with routines in ciao v1.1.5 .",
    "the anti - coincidence shield of hrc - s is not operational , owing to a timing error in the electronics .",
    "this leads to a much higher background rate of ( false ) events .",
    "however , the intrinsic energy resolution of the detector ( though poor ) can be used to easily remove 25% of this by excluding the highest energy channel .",
    "a sliding - cell detection routine ( tgdetect ) confirmed that only the one source was strongly detected , the lmxb , and also centroided its position to within 0.03  ( 0.2 pix ) .",
    "a lightcurve was also extracted using all available data .",
    "regions were defined covering the 0th and 1st order images , and 4 rectangular background regions above and below .",
    "the events were then summed into 2s bins , the background scaled and lastly subtracted using the ciao routine lightcurve .",
    "four orbits ( @xmath012 ks ) of _ hst_/stis @xcite imaging were undertaken on 1999 march 24 .",
    "we used the fuv mama with the long - pass quartz filter in time - tag mode , to provide complete flexibility for temporal analysis .",
    "its @xmath7 field of view covered both the cluster core and the entire _ einstein _",
    "x - ray error circle . in this @xmath014001700",
    "passband even the core of the globular cluster is uncrowded ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fuvchart ] , lower left ) , and we found that 0.2  radius aperture photometry worked best ( optimized according to a curve of growth analysis ) . to limit systematic effects we applied differential photometry , whereby the magnitudes of the stars of interest were calculated relative to an ensemble of the brightest stars in the field .",
    "although the superlative psf of _ chandra _ enables a very precise determination of a relative position for the x - ray source , we require an absolute value . unfortunately , the lack of other bright x - ray sources in the field means that we can not derive a precise absolute position by correcting relative to known positions .",
    "instead , we rely on the calibration of the observatory s aspect .",
    "team has made a detailed study of the aspect behaviour , based on comparisons between the x - ray positions of all sources with identifications and precise positions in the optical / radio , specifically objects appearing in the hipparcos / tycho-2 @xcite , usno a-2 @xcite and icrf @xcite catalogs .",
    "this has revealed a long - term drift in the aspect of each of the detector systems , although only 10 data points are available for hrc - s observations to date .",
    "we were provided with the appropriate corrections ( from a linear fit ) for the date of our observation .",
    "for all detectors combined the residuals then have an rms of 0.6 , whilst for the hrc - s subset the value is slightly larger , 0.7 .",
    "we adopt this latter value as an estimate of the intrinsic aspect uncertainty .",
    "l l l l c l l & no . of & @xmath8(ra)&@xmath8(dec ) & & dataset + positions & matches & ( seconds ) & ( arcsecs ) & ra(2000 ) & dec(2000 ) & + aspect & & & & 5:14:6.43 & -40:02:37.63&_chandra _ x - ray + usno a-2 & 267 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & 5:14:6.41 & -40:02:38.22&_hst _ optical / uv + tycho-2 & 36 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & 5:14:6.42 & -40:02:38.05&_hst _",
    "optical / uv +    before we can overlay our x - ray position onto the _ hst_/fuv image , a final correction must be made for different frames of reference .",
    "essentially the fuv image can be tied directly to the @xmath13 band images used by @xcite , upon which accurate astrometry was performed to derive the optical positions of the various stars of interest within the _ einstein _ error circleerg@xmath14s@xmath5 is fully consistent with the previous fos and wfpc2 results . ] . however ,",
    "this astrometry made use of the then current _ hst _ guide star catalog ( hst - gsc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which predates the adoption of the international celestial reference system ( icrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the hipparcos / tycho , usno a-2 and icrf catalog are grounded . hence , we have calculated the offsets between hst - gsc and icrs by matching stars appearing in both hst - gsc and either tycho-2 or usno a-2 within 630  of the position of x0512 - 401  ( thereby excluding the crowded regions at the globular cluster center ) .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : offsets ] . for clarity",
    "we combine the rms uncertainty in this final frame offset with the _ chandra _ positional uncertainty , yielding 90% error radii of 1.3  and 1.2  for tycho-2 and usno a-2 offsetting respectively . in both cases , the _ chandra _",
    "x - ray position area is reduced by a factor of 6 from the _ einstein _ result , and as shown in figure  [ fig : fuvchart ] , the @xcite candidate star  a still lies squarely within .",
    "we can also now finally exclude x1 @xcite at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "star  a is in fact the _ only _ uv bright object visible within the _ chandra _ error circle , and the probability of a chance alignment has been reduced to @xmath15 following the arguments of @xcite .",
    "globular cluster x - ray sources are thought to essentially all be x - ray bursters . despite the very high quiescent x - ray flux of this source , there appears to be only one previously - published x - ray burst , observed a quarter - century ago from _ uhuru _",
    "@xcite , obviously with very limited angular resolution .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations fortuitously observe and spatially resolve an x - ray burst ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we thus can now definitively associate the quiescent x - ray source x0512 - 401 , the x - ray burster , and the optical counterpart .",
    "we have also searched for variability in the persistent x - ray emission , but find none , setting a 99% confidence upper limit of 4% on the semi - amplitude of any periodic modulation between 1  min and 1.5  hr ( after subtraction of a 385s sinusoid , an artifact of dithering ) .",
    "interestingly , our results on the fuv variability are equally null . as expected star x1 appears to be a constant source ( upper limit of 2.4% ) , but so does star  a. the limit on star  a of 5% on the semi - amplitude flux modulation between 5  min and 6  hr provides a significant constraint . for comparison ,",
    "the measured uv modulation semi - amplitudes for the sources in ngc6624 and ngc6712 are @xmath08% and @xmath04% respectively @xcite .",
    "the assumption that any uv modulation would arise from the varying contribution of the x - ray heated donor star s face implies a low inclination ( @xmath16 ) for the ngc1851 system .",
    "lastly , we also checked for any burst events in the reprocessed uv flux , but again we found nothing .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations confirm the bursting nature of , and provide a new precise and accurate x - ray position for , the luminous source x0512 - 401  in the core of ngc1851 .",
    "our _ chandra _ error circle is @xmath06@xmath17 smaller than the previous one from _",
    "einstein_. comparison to a deep _ hst_/stis fuv image shows that the @xmath01  error circle now excludes all other fuv bright stars , hence providing yet stronger support for our previous identification of the faint ( m@xmath18=5.6 ) , uv - excess ( = -0.9 ) star  a as the optical / uv counterpart to x0512 - 401 .",
    "stis time - tag data were searched for variability on timescales from 5  min to 6  hr , but none was found , requiring a low system inclination .    the extremely low optical luminosity of star  a ( confirmed here to be the only uv bright object in the accurate _",
    "chandra _ error circle ) , resulting in a relatively high x - ray to optical luminosity ratio , implies an ultra - compact system , where the small accretion disc provides relatively little reprocessing area .",
    "both the similarity of the optical / uv spectral energy distributions of the counterpart in ngc6712 and star  a @xcite , and the broad - band x - ray spectra of these sources and that in ngc6624 @xcite , further support the premise that the ngc1851 system should have a ultra - short binary period , @xmath191  hr .    we thank tom aldcroft of the _ chandra _ aspect team for assistance with the calibration of the x - ray position and estimates of its uncertainty .",
