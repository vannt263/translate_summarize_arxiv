    "the physics of ising spin glasses ( isgs ) in the `` ordered '' regime below the freezing temperature @xmath7 has been intensively investigated for decades ; the paramagnetic regime above @xmath7 has attracted less attention . however , in addition to the standard ordering ( or freezing ) transitions other significant `` critical '' temperatures within the paramagnetic regime can be defined operationally and estimated numerically with high precision .",
    "we have studied random - bond ising models ( rbim ) in dimensions two , three , four and five having ferromagnetic near neighbor interactions with probability @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic interactions with probability @xmath8 over the whole range of @xmath2 in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath9 where the sum is taken over all nearest neighbour bonds @xmath10 .    for the discrete @xmath11 interaction distribution the bond values",
    "are thus chosen according to @xmath12 we will set @xmath13 and use when convenient inverse temperatures @xmath14 .",
    "the pure ising model is recovered for @xmath15 and the pure antiferromagnetic model for @xmath16 , while the standard strong disorder bimodal spin glass case corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the standard ferromagnetic and spin glass ordering transitions , on the rbim phase diagram in the paramagnetic regime other physically significant lines can be operationally defined as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the griffiths line ( @xmath18 ) @xcite and the nishimori line @xcite there is the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) transition line @xmath0 @xcite and the heat - bath damage spreading transition line @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "early large scale relaxation measurements on the isg in dimension three were interpreted @xcite in terms of a dynamic transition at the griffiths temperature ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , with a qualitative change in relaxation behavior of the autocorrelation function from non - exponential to exponential .",
    "it can alternatively be considered that @xmath20 or @xmath21 defines a dynamic transition . at @xmath20",
    "the fk cluster size diverges so the standard cluster flipping algorithms @xcite break down . at @xmath21 , the time scale for the `` coupling from the past '' equilibration criterion",
    "@xmath22 diverges at large @xmath23 @xcite so this criterion similarly breaks down .",
    "_ a priori _ it seems plausible that the two dynamic breakdowns should occur at similar , if perhaps not identical , temperatures as has been conjectured by a number of authors @xcite .    in the following discussion",
    "it is shown that there are universal analytic relations for the intersection point between @xmath0 and the nishimori line @xcite . with these exact values in hand together with the present accurate numerical damage spreading data a critical test can be made of the conjectured rule @xmath24 .",
    "this is shown to be a good approximation , almost exact in dimension three and accurate to a few percent in dimensions two , four and five .",
    "however the equality between the temperatures is not a general rule .",
    "nishimori @xcite has shown for the rbim that , due to extra symmetries of the problem , a number of quantities may be computed exactly when the equality @xmath25 holds ; this condition defines the nishimori line ( nl ) , a line traversing the entire @xmath26 phase diagram including both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes .",
    "in particular on the nl the internal energy of the system per bond ( or edge ) is @xmath27    = - \\tanh(\\beta_{nl } ) \\label{nlu}\\ ] ] this energy per bond has exactly the value that independent bonds would have at the same temperature .",
    "we will see below that indeed on the nl the positions of the satisfied bonds are uncorrelated @xcite and that bond positions remain very close to random over a wide strong disorder regime around @xmath28 .",
    "in other words anywhere on the nl the satisfied bonds are uncorrelated on average , so _ a fortiori _ the fk active bonds are distributed at random .",
    "the rule for the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) transition line @xcite , corresponding initially to the pure ferromagnets , is to first select for some particular equilibrium configuration the entire set of `` satisfied '' bonds @xmath10 where @xmath29 is positive .",
    "these bonds are then decimated at random leaving a fraction @xmath30 $ ] of `` active '' satisfied bonds .",
    "the fk stochastic transition at @xmath20 occurs when the set of active bonds percolates through the lattice . from the way in which the bonds are laid down , in the general case this is correlated bond percolation , as opposed to the standard uncorrelated bond percolation with random bond occupation .",
    "remarkably , for pure ferromagnets it can be proved that the fk transition @xmath31 coincides exactly with the curie temperature @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the swendsen - wang and wolff cluster algorithms @xcite speed up equilibration dramatically as long as the fk clusters remain of finite size .    the same operational definition can also be used elsewhere in the phase diagram ; in particular @xmath33 was estimated numerically for strong disorder rbim on square , cubic , and triangular lattices @xcite .",
    "it turned out that @xmath33 was in each case much higher than the standard spin glass ordering temperature @xmath34 .",
    "even in the two - dimensional case where the glass temperature is zero , @xmath33 is similar to but lower than the griffiths temperature @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the physical basis for the percolation transition temperature was explained in terms of `` fk droplets '' for the case of the fully frustrated lattice and general potts @xmath36 in refs .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath0 numerically over the entire range of @xmath2 for the square and triangular rbim lattices .    below we will introduce a further temperature @xmath37 closely related to @xmath0 . by construction the fraction of satisfied bonds @xmath38 in equilibrium is related to the equilibrium internal energy per bond @xmath39 through @xmath40 so the fraction of all bonds which are fk active bonds is just @xcite @xmath41/2 .",
    "\\label{pa}\\ ] ] @xmath39 and hence @xmath42 can be readily measured numerically to high precision .",
    "it was noted @xcite that if the satisfied bond positions are assumed to be uncorrelated , the fk transition would occur at a temperature such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the standard random bond percolation concentration for the lattice .",
    "we will refer to the temperature where the condition @xmath45 is satisfied as @xmath37 ( @xmath46 standing for random ) .",
    "this conjecture led to estimates for @xmath47 on square and on cubic lattices in higher dimensions @xcite which were in good agreement with the numerical estimates for @xmath33 available at the time .",
    "it can be noticed that for the pure ising square lattice ferromagnet at criticality @xmath48 while @xmath49 which is very different because the positions of the satisfied bonds are strongly correlated . however",
    "the critical fk concentration of active bonds is @xmath50 which is `` accidentally '' equal to @xmath51 for this lattice . for the pure ising ferromagnet on the triangular lattice at criticality on the other hand @xmath52 which is not quite equal to @xmath53 for this lattice .",
    "finally , a heat - bath damage spreading transition , @xmath1 can be defined @xcite .",
    "heat - bath update rules are applied at fixed temperature to two initially non - identical spin configurations @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( which are not necessarily equilibrated ) of a given sample ( meaning @xmath56 and @xmath57 have exactly the same sets of interactions @xmath58 ) ; the random number used in each subsequent single spin update step is the same for both configurations . at high enough temperatures , on annealing under this procedure for sufficient time @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 will become identical ; below the damage temperature @xmath21 the `` damage '' ( @xmath62 the hamming distance between @xmath60 and @xmath61 divided by @xmath63 ) will stabilize for long times at a temperature dependent non - zero value .",
    "for the pure ferromagnet case @xmath64 is equal to the curie temperature @xmath65 @xcite . for the strong disorder spin glass , just as @xmath33 is much higher than the glass temperature @xmath34 , @xmath66 is also much higher than @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the damage spreading transition for a given coupling algorithm , in particular heat bath ( hb ) , can be described as a `` regular to chaotic '' dynamic transition from the viewpoint of the `` coupling from the past '' approach .",
    "when the damage falls to zero after a sufficient anneal time it is a guarantee that the system has been strictly equilibrated @xcite . in systems with frustration this guarantee breaks down when @xmath68 , so perfect equilibration in this sense for the regime near the critical temperature can not be achieved .    it should be noted that @xmath21 depends on the updating protocol , with for instance glauber updating giving very different results from hb updating .",
    "it turns out that even within the hb protocol the precise value obtained for @xmath21 changes slightly depending on whether sequential or random updating is used .",
    "the results reported here are for random updating . with sequential updating the observed",
    "damage spreading temperature is of the order of @xmath69 lower .",
    "early comparisons of numerical data from different groups indicated that @xmath70 for dimensions two and three @xcite , and on this basis it has been conjectured by a number of authors @xcite that @xmath3 is a general rule defining a joint dynamic transition temperature above which relaxation is exponential in the long time limit and below which relaxation is chaotic . it should be noted that in practice it is very hard to identify such a transition directly from autocorrelation function decay @xmath71 data .",
    "recently yamaguchi @xcite focused attention on behavior on the nl .",
    "he provided conjectures suggesting that the intersection of the @xmath0 line and the nl would occur when @xmath72 and @xmath73/2    \\label{tyg}\\ ] ] where again @xmath44 is the random percolation concentration for the lattice .",
    "it turns out that because of the analytic value for the energy @xmath74 on the nl , eq .",
    ", the yamaguchi condition is strictly equivalent to the equality @xmath75 , meaning that this condition holds if the fk active bonds are distributed at random . the random bond conjecture for @xmath76 , eq . ( 4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , is identical to eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact nishimori @xcite years earlier had made the strict statement : `` we have also proved independence of the local internal energy of different bonds , which indicates that the system effectively splits into uncorrelated sets of bonds on the [ nl ] in the phase diagram . '' in other words anywhere on the nl the satisfied bonds are uncorrelated _ on average _ , so _ a fortiori _ the fk active bonds are distributed at random . hence at the nl - fk intersection concentration @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 , meaning that the conditions for this intersection conjectured by yamaguchi , eq .",
    "and eq .  , hold exactly for any rbim lattice if the fk transition is a random active bond percolation transition . remarkably , a further consequence of nishimori s statement is that this equality should hold _ for the mean over many samples _ independently of the sample size @xmath23 .",
    "the numerical results below show that for dimension two , and presumably in other dimensions also , in addition to this identity at @xmath77 , for a wide range of @xmath2 around @xmath28 , @xmath79 remains a very good approximation , as was conjectured for @xmath28 in ref .",
    "the active bonds are thus essentially uncorrelated at @xmath80 in this wide `` high disorder '' regime .",
    "it should be noted however that as a general rule the positions of active bonds are correlated so @xmath0 is not equal to @xmath37 .",
    "yamaguchi @xcite , following refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of @xmath28 , also conjectured that @xmath81 at the intersection .",
    "the present measurements show that in dimension two @xmath1 is in fact systematically lower than @xmath0 by a few @xmath82 over the entire range of @xmath2 , except at and near the pure ferromagnet limit @xmath83 . at @xmath77 for cubic models in dimensions",
    "three to five the conjecture holds to within about @xmath6 in dimension three , to @xmath84 in dimension four and to @xmath85 in dimension five .",
    "the general relation @xmath24 is therefore simply a reasonably good approximation . in dimensions two , three and four",
    "the present data show that the damage spreading transition temperature like the fk transition temperature is very insensitive to @xmath2 for a wide range of @xmath2 around @xmath28 .",
    "the two dimensional lattices studied were the square lattice and the triangular lattice . on both lattices",
    "the standard phase diagrams as functions of @xmath2 are well established .",

    "when @xmath2 is lowered from @xmath83 , the curie temperature @xmath88 drops gradually until a critical point is reached at @xmath89 on the nishimori line where the curie temperature tends suddenly to zero with weak re - entrant behavior @xcite . between the re - entrant regime and @xmath17 the system can be considered a `` spin glass '' but with no finite temperature ordering transition .",
    "the square lattice phase diagram for @xmath90 is the exact mirror image of the phase diagram for @xmath91 with antiferromagnetic order taking the place of ferromagnetic order as the lattice is bipartite . for the triangular lattice on the other hand",
    "there is no finite temperature order below @xmath28 as the fully frustrated antiferromagnetic limit at @xmath92 is approached .",
    "the internal energy per bond @xmath93 at equilibrium was estimated numerically . for small triangular lattices , @xmath94 ,",

    "this standard approach is described in great detail for the ising case in section 3 of @xcite and is of course easily adapted to the spin glass case .",

    "the error bars correspond mainly to the residual uncertainty in the extrapolation to the intersection with the @xmath161 axis.,width=336 ]    [ fig:8 ]     square lattice at @xmath199 and temperature @xmath200 , just below the damage spreading transition.,width=336 ]    [ fig : snap ]    the measurements take place as above for the damage spreading ; starting from random ( infinite temperature ) spin configurations , at each time step we update @xmath63 randomly selected sites , then search for all clusters and their sizes . on a measurement",
    "we collect the number of clusters , the average cluster size , the size of the largest cluster and the size of a randomly selected cluster .",
    "as before , we collect @xmath201 measurements from each sample after discarding between @xmath202 and @xmath203 time steps ( depending on @xmath23 ) to allow for equilibration of the damage spreading .",
    "we then average over the time steps to get the average for a particular sample .",
    "the data are then averaged over the samples ; we have only used eight samples in each case for the cluster measurements ( for the damage speading we used between 8 and 128 samples depending on lattice size ) . in all cases",
    "we have set @xmath204 .",
    "first we discuss the expected number of clusters , which we denote @xmath205 . in figure  [ fig:10 ]",
    "we plot @xmath206 versus @xmath161 for the simple cubic lattice .",
    "equivalent behavior is found also for @xmath207 .",
    "note that for the square lattice all lattice sizes agree on a global maximum probability located at @xmath208 , where @xmath209 .",
    "for @xmath210 we obtain @xmath211 and @xmath212 , for @xmath213 we get @xmath214 and @xmath215 , while @xmath216 gave @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "thus the damage is always distributed over @xmath219 clusters .     on the 3d cubic lattice normalized by @xmath220 at @xmath204 .",

    "sizes @xmath221 shown as black squares , red circles , blue triangles , green inverted triangles , pink left triangles .",
    "the errors are smaller than the size of the points.,width=336 ]    [ fig:11 ]     at inverse temperatures @xmath222 ( black squares , red circles , green triangles , and blue inverted triangles ) . the errors are of the size of the points except for very small @xmath2 where they can be judged by the scatter ( note the logarithmic scales).,width=336 ]    [ fig:12 ]    with so many clusters the average cluster at each time step must be rather small .",
    "we measure the number of damaged sites @xmath223 and the number of clusters @xmath224 , giving us the mean cluster size at each time step .",
    "the normalized time average ( and then the sample average , though the sample variation is very small ) , is then @xmath225 . in figure  [ fig:11 ]",
    "we plot @xmath226 versus @xmath161 , again for @xmath210 .",
    "the curve clearly suggests a positive right limit at @xmath162 . to estimate this limit we fit a simple expression @xmath227 to the points resulting in @xmath228 .",
    "we estimated the right limits corresponding to @xmath196 to be respectively @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 sites at @xmath162 .",
    "one could alternatively define @xmath233 as the average damage divided by the average number of clusters .",
    "this is not strictly the same as our present definition ( mean ratio versus ratio of the means ) but the difference is of course vanishingly small here .",
    "for example , the maximum in figure  [ fig:10 ] at @xmath234 gives @xmath235 and the number of damaged sites , see figure  [ fig:6 ] , is @xmath236 .",
    "hence the average cluster size is roughly @xmath237 which matches figure  [ fig:11 ] .",
    "we end this section with a final remark concerning the distribution of cluster sizes . at each time step",
    "we here pick one cluster uniformly at random and measure its size . in figure  [ fig:12 ]",
    "we show a set of size distributions ( or density functions ) as @xmath238 vs @xmath239 for a range of @xmath161 for @xmath240 .",
    "they all have a high value at size @xmath132 ( many isolated sites ) and then drop quickly .",
    "they can be expected to behave like this since the mean size is between @xmath241 and @xmath242 in this temperature range .",
    "however , for @xmath243 ( or thereabout ) the distributions show a second , and rather wide , maximum located in the neighborhood of the total damage @xmath244 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose for the sake of argument that the damaged sites are distributed at random in space .",
    "( this is only approximate as correlations between damage sites should be allowed for ) .",
    "then when @xmath245 exceeds the site percolation concentration there will exist a single `` giant '' percolating cluster of damaged sites together with residual small clusters . as @xmath245 increases",
    "further the percolating cluster will contain almost all the damaged sites . on this criterion",
    "the peak should appear in the distribution at @xmath246 and @xmath247 in dimensions @xmath248 and @xmath249 respectively which gives an indication in rough agreement with the data .",
    "indeed in the case of the square the peak never appears which is consistent with the fact that @xmath245 never approaches @xmath250 .",
    "for the dimensions where the peak does appear the global parameters , in particular @xmath245 , increase smoothly with @xmath161 and show no sign of any critical behavior as the giant cluster forms .",
    "the exact values of the coordinates of the intersection point where the fortuin - kasteleyn transition line crosses the nishimori line can be derived for an rbim from the analytic condition that satisfied bonds are uncorrelated on the nl @xcite . on any lattice",
    "this leads to the exact expressions @xmath251 and @xmath252 $ ] @xcite where @xmath44 is the standard random bond percolation concentration for the particular lattice . for lattices in dimension two ( and probably in higher dimensions also ) the uncorrelated bond condition remains a very good approximation at the fk transition temperature over a wide strong - disorder region spanning @xmath28 .    in pure ferromagnets @xmath253 . the conjectured equivalence for the rbim between the fk transition temperature and the heat bath damage spreading temperature , @xmath138 @xcite , separating an exponential from a chaotic dynamic regime has been tested at @xmath204 on simple cubic lattices in dimensions two , three , four and five",
    "it holds to within @xmath6 in dimension three , to within @xmath84 in dimension four , and to @xmath254 in dimension five .",
    "the equivalence appears always to be a good approximation .",
    "we have no explanation to propose for the quasi - equality in the case of dimension three .    for the square and triangle lattices",
    "the difference is larger : @xmath255 and @xmath256 respectively .",
    "the fk transition in the strong - disorder regime close to @xmath28 can thus be said to be well understood .",
    "however the basic physical condition determining the the damage spreading transition temperature , which plays an important role in limiting perfect equilibration in rbims , and its proximity to the fk transition , remains unclear .",
