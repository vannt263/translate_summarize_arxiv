    "in its strongest form , gravitational lensing produces unmistakably distorted , amplified , and multiplied images of distant astronomical objects .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the majority of known galaxy - scale gravitational lens systems have been discovered through imaging observations .",
    "however , a small number of lenses have been discovered spectroscopically , with the spectrum of a targeted galaxy showing evidence of emission from a background source and follow - up imaging revealing lensing morphology .",
    "the three most secure examples are the lensed quasars 2237 + 0305 @xcite and sdss j0903 + 5028 @xcite and the lensed lyman-@xmath0 emitting galaxy 0047@xmath12808 @xcite .",
    "several authors have made predictions for the frequency of lensed quasar discoveries in galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "others , inspired by the discovery of 0047@xmath12808 , have undertaken spectroscopic searches for lensed lyman-@xmath0-bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "the idea behind such searches is that a massive foreground galaxy should act as an effective gravitational lens of _ any _ object positioned sufficiently far behind it and at small enough impact parameter , and any emission features from such lensed objects should be detectable in the spectra of the foreground galaxy .",
    "therefore a search for discrepant emission features in galaxy spectra can potentially lead to a sample of gravitational lens systems that would not be discovered in broadband imaging searches due to faintness of source relative to lens .",
    "this `` lenses - looking - for - sources '' approach is complementary to lens searches such as the recently completed cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which proceed by targeting sources and looking for evidence of an intervening lens .    with its massive scale and quality of data ,",
    "the spectroscopic component of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provides an unprecedented opportunity for spectroscopic galaxy - galaxy gravitational lens discovery .",
    "this paper presents the first results of such a search within a sample of @xmath251,000 sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) spectra ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e01 ) : a catalog of candidate lensed star - forming galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "the lens candidates presented in this paper were detected by the presence of not one but ( at least ) three emission lines in the lrg spectra identified as nebular emission from a single background redshift :  and two out of the three of h@xmath3 @xmath4 , , and ( all emission - line wavelengths in this paper are vacuum values , in angstroms ) .",
    "this implies a maximum redshift of @xmath5 for any candidate lensed galaxies : at higher redshifts , [ o  iii ] emission moves off the red end of the sdss spectrograph .    the lensing cross section of a particular foreground galaxy is lower for intermediate - redshift sources than high - redshift sources , and in this sense the lens search we describe here is at a disadvantage relative to searches for lensed high - redshift lyman-@xmath0 emitters",
    "however , the identities of the emission lines in the sample we present here are absolutely unambiguous .",
    "this can not be said for spectroscopic lyman-@xmath0 lens candidates , which are typically detected as single discrepant emission lines and are difficult to distinguish from lower - redshift emission or ( in the case of a huge survey such as the sdss ) non - astrophysical spectral artifacts .",
    "( a forthcoming paper will present sdss single - line [ o  ii ] and lyman-@xmath0 lens candidates . ) our spectroscopic lens search based on multiple - line detection has further advantages .",
    "first , the source redshift of any lensed galaxies will be known from the outset .",
    "second , for a given limiting line flux , star - forming galaxies at intermediate redshift are more numerous on the sky than lyman-@xmath0 emitters at high redshift ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence strong lensing events could be more frequent despite decreased lensing cross sections .",
    "the non - lensed source population should thus be more amenable to study and characterization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , facilitating lens statistical analysis .",
    "finally , intermediate - redshift lensed galaxies would probe the mass distribution of the lens population in a systematically different manner than do high - redshift sources .",
    "the search for new lens systems is motivated by the unique power of gravitational lensing to constrain the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy .",
    "@xcite argued that strong galaxy - galaxy gravitational lenses in the optical band should be both ubiquitous and of great scientific interest , but their detection has proved difficult .",
    "in addition to the optical einstein ring 0047@xmath12808 mentioned above , @xcite have published one more spectroscopic galaxy - lens candidate . _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging has also had some success in detecting lensed galaxies , as described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but spectroscopic confirmation remains a challenge in most cases .",
    "lensed galaxies are especially useful for investigating the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy because unlike lensed quasars they are spatially resolved sources which provide more detailed constraints ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "as with lensed quasars , the relative angular deflections between multiple images can constrain the total deflecting lens mass .",
    "but the relative distortions of multiple images can provide constraints as well , probing the slope of the radial mass profile and allowing more detailed connection with theories of galaxy formation and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the promise of our candidate sample is enhanced by the fact that lens _ and _ source redshifts for any confirmed lens systems will be known from the outset with great precision ; this is generally not the case for lenses discovered in optical imaging or radio data .",
    "the lack of sufficient lensing constraints on the radial slope of the galaxy mass profile in lensed quasar systems is the greatest source of uncertainty in the hubble constant ( @xmath6 ) values derived from the time delays between images @xcite , which remain systematically low compared to the current best @xmath6 values from the distance ladder @xcite and cosmic microwave background @xcite ; @xcite highlights the importance of resolving this discrepancy .",
    "any galaxy - galaxy lenses confirmed within our current list of candidates would help to solve this problem by expanding the sample for ensemble lensing studies of early - type galaxy mass profiles like that of @xcite and allowing for the inclusion of distortion information as mentioned above .",
    "the generally lower lens and source redshifts of our candidate systems as compared to known lens systems are also of particular interest because the images of any strong lenses within our sample will tend to form at smaller _ physical _ radii within the lens galaxy than in current lens systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) , thus probing elliptical galaxy mass profiles in a systematically different manner1231 , has @xmath7 @xcite . ] .",
    "a large enough sample of strongly lensed star - forming galaxies could even be monitored directly for supernovae .",
    "multiple images of the same supernova would give time delays and @xmath6 measurements , as numerous authors have envisioned @xcite .",
    "if we assume one supernova per galaxy per century as an order - of - magnitude estimate @xcite , a program to monitor @xmath8 lensed galaxies for several years would have a good chance of success .",
    "numerous studies have addressed the inability of standard macroscopic galaxy mass models to predict the flux ratios observed between images of strongly lensed quasars .",
    "some authors have suggested that this phenomenon may be due to the effects of substructure in the lensing galaxy on the scale of either cdm sub - halos @xcite or stars @xcite , while others have invoked macroscopically modified lens models as a possible explanation @xcite .",
    "a sizeable sample of strongly lensed galaxies would provide valuable insight into this problem : by virtue of the arcsecond - scale intrinsic angular size of the source , galaxy - galaxy lenses will be immune to the lensing effects of any substructure with lensing deflection angles on the scale of microarcseconds ( stars ) or milliarcseconds ( sub - halos ) . if the suppressed saddle point image fluxes seen in many quasar lenses",
    "are indeed due to macroscopic inadequacies in the standard lens models , similar effects should be seen in galaxy - galaxy lenses .",
    "if on the other hand these effects are due to micro / millilensing by substructure , they should be absent from lensed galaxy systems .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey is a project to image roughly one - quarter of the sky in five optical bands and obtain spectroscopic follow - up observations of @xmath9 galaxies and @xmath10 quasars . @xcite",
    "provide a technical summary of the survey , @xcite describe the sdss camera , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite discuss the photometric system and calibration , @xcite discuss sdss astrometry , @xcite present the spectroscopic plate tiling algorithm , and @xcite and @xcite describe the survey data products .",
    "approximately 12% of the galaxy spectroscopic fibers are allocated to the lrg sample ( e01 ) , selected to consist of very luminous ( @xmath11)and hence massive  early - type galaxies at higher redshift than the galaxies of the main sample @xcite .",
    "we expect these lrgs to be particularly effective gravitational lenses of any objects positioned suitably behind them , and we concentrate our spectroscopic lens search on them .",
    "we also note that lrgs should have little dust and therefore any lensed background galaxies should suffer minimal extinction .",
    "the sample for our current study consists of 50996 spectra taken between 5 march 2000 and 27 may 2003 of sdss imaging objects flagged as galaxy_red by the photometric pipeline @xcite for passing either of the lrg cuts described by e01 , reduced by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ( j. frieman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and selected to have redshifts between 0.15 and 0.65 as determined by the specbs redshift - finding software ( d. j. schlegel et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the low - redshift cutoff is needed because less massive galaxies start to pass the photometric cuts below @xmath12 and pollute the volume - limited lrg sample ; see the discussion in e01 and the bimodal lrg sample redshift histogram in ( * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to being much more massive than the average galaxy , lrgs have another property that makes them well suited to a spectroscopic lens survey : their spectra are extremely regular and well - characterized ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to determine the spectroscopic redshift of an sdss target galaxy with observed specific flux @xmath13 and one - sigma sky@xmath14source noise spectrum @xmath15 , the specbs program employs a small set of galaxy eigenspectra ( four in the reductions for this study ) derived from a rest - frame principal - component analysis ( pca ) of 480 galaxy spectra taken on sdss plate 306 , mjd 51690",
    "this eigenbasis is incrementally redshifted , and a model spectrum is generated from the best - fit linear combination to the observed spectrum at each trial redshift , with the final redshift assignment given by the trial value that yields the overall minimum @xmath16 .",
    "although redshift is the primary output of this procedure , a byproduct of specbs is the best - fit model spectrum itself , @xmath17 . in the case of lrgs",
    ", @xmath17 typically provides a very detailed and accurate fit to @xmath13 , with a reduced @xmath16 of order unity over almost 4000 spectral pixels ( roughly 1600 spectral resolution elements ) attained with only 8 free parameters : a redshift , the four eigen - galaxy coefficients , and the three terms of a quadratic polynomial to fit out spectrophotometric errors and extinction effects , both of which exist at the few - percent level .",
    "this extremely regular spectral behavior allows us to form residual lrg spectra @xmath18 that are in principle realizations of @xmath15 .",
    "nebular emission lines from galaxies along the line of sight other than the target lrg will not be modeled by specbs and should appear as significant features localized in wavelength within these residual spectra .",
    "figure  [ noise_spec ] shows the median 1-@xmath19 line flux sensitivity within our lrg residual spectrum sample as a function of wavelength .",
    "the ( 20th , 50th , 80th)-percentile lrg spectra themselves have a median signal - to - noise per pixel of ( 3.3 , 5.1 , 9.6 ) at the sdss resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "this section describes our candidate selection routine in detail . briefly stated , we select as initial candidates those spectra that show _ both _",
    "blended  at @xmath21 _ and _ two out of the three lines h@xmath3 @xmath4 , , and  at @xmath22 , then cull the candidate list by applying cuts based on more detailed fits to the presumed emission features , and finally remove any obviously spurious detections .",
    "this selection process yields a substantial number of promising systems without an excess of obvious false positives .",
    "the key element in the first step of our lens candidate selection ( described fully in   [ select ] below ) is a straightforward matched - filtering procedure to search for significant emission features by fitting a gaussian line profile at each point in the residual spectrum @xcite .",
    "we describe our implementation here so as to be explicit .",
    "let @xmath23 be the residual flux in pixel @xmath24 and @xmath25 be the statistical variance of @xmath23 .",
    "s@xmath26 @xmath26 to units of ergs @xmath27 s@xmath26 pixel@xmath26 is made using the re - binned sdss spectroscopic pixel scale relation @xmath28 . ]",
    "also let @xmath29 describe a gaussian kernel , centered on @xmath30 , with @xmath31 running from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , and normalized such that @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator @xmath35 for the line flux @xmath36 of any @xmath29-shaped residual emission feature centered on pixel @xmath24 is that which minimizes @xmath37 differentiating ( [ chi2 ] ) with respect to @xmath36 , setting the resulting expression to zero , and solving yields @xmath38 where we have defined the convolutions @xmath39 the variance of @xmath35 ( under the assumption of uncorrelated gaussian errors in @xmath23 as described by @xmath25 ) is given by @xmath40 the signal - to - noise ratio for a fitted gaussian profile centered on pixel @xmath24 is therefore @xmath41 our null hypothesis is an absence of emission features in the residual spectra that should manifest as the @xmath42 being gaussian - distributed about zero with unit variance : this should hold at most wavelengths in most spectra .",
    "we approach the initial search for emission lines in the residual spectra as a search for significance peaks with @xmath43 greater than some threshold value .",
    "although insensitive to goodness - of - fit , this convolution - based detection scheme executes quickly and is therefore well suited to the initial search for residual emission features within our large spectral sample .",
    "appendix  [ noisemodel ] describes a noise - rescaling process that we employ to control the incidence of false - positive emission - feature detections ( due primarily to imperfect sky subtraction ) without masking regions of the spectrum .",
    "multiple emission features at the same redshift will have redshift - independent wavelength ratios .",
    "the fully reduced sdss spectra have been re - binned at a constant - velocity pixel scale of 69 km s@xmath26 , giving a redshift - independent pixel offset between features .",
    "our operational scheme is thus to search for coincident @xmath43 peaks between multiple copies of a single filtered residual spectrum that have been shifted relative to one another . for  detection ,",
    "we filter each residual spectrum with a @xmath44-pixel gaussian kernel ( matched to the typical width of blended  emission seen in sdss starburst galaxies ) .",
    "we take copies of the same residual spectrum `` blueshifted '' by integer pixel amounts so as to place h@xmath45 @xmath46 , h@xmath47 @xmath48 , h@xmath3 @xmath4 , , , @xmath49 , h@xmath0 @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53  as close as possible to 3728.48  , the geometric - mean wavelength of the  doublet .",
    "these shifted spectra are filtered with a @xmath54-pixel gaussian kernel ( matched to the typical width of sdss starburst  emission ) , with the sub - pixel part of the line offset relative to 3728.48   incorporated by offsetting the kernel .",
    "any pixel in the filtered @xmath55 spectra with value greater than 3 for  and value greater than 2.5 for two out of h@xmath3 @xmath4 , , and is tagged as a `` hit '' .",
    "a group of adjacent `` hit '' pixels is reduced to the single pixel with the greatest quadrature - sum @xmath55 for lines detected above the threshold ( in effect , the pixel most inconsistent with the null hypothesis ) .",
    "spectra with more than one isolated hit are rejected .",
    "the spectra are only searched in regions that would correspond to emission from @xmath56 km s@xmath26 behind the targeted lrg .",
    "the preceding selection leads to 163 hits within our 51,000 spectra . for each hit",
    ", we explore a grid of redshift and intrinsic emission - line - width values for the background galaxy to find a best - fit model .",
    "at each grid point we fit a gaussian profile to any emission line initially detected above a 2.0-@xmath55 threshold , with the line center determined by the trial redshift and line - width given by the quadrature sum of the trial intrinsic line - width and the measured spectrograph resolution at the observed wavelength of each line .",
    "is fit with a double gaussian profile .",
    "we adopt as best values for background redshift @xmath57 and ( gaussian-@xmath19 ) intrinsic line - width @xmath58 those that give the minimum @xmath16 over all detected lines .",
    "the @xmath57 extent of our grid corresponds to @xmath592 pixels , and the explored @xmath58 range runs from 0 to 2 pixels ( 0 to 138 km s@xmath26 ) .",
    "following these fits , we subject the candidate sample to several cuts .",
    "first , we reject any system where no convergent ( minimum @xmath16 ) value for @xmath57 is found within the explored @xmath592-pixel range : real background emission systems should have convergent best - fit redshifts roughly coincident with their convolution - based @xmath55 peaks .",
    "similarly , we cut systems with no convergent @xmath58 between 0 and 2 pixels : the features of real systems should neither be narrower than the spectrograph resolution nor wider than a reasonable upper limit for emission features of faint star - forming galaxies .",
    "finally , we compute a total signal - to - noise ratio for the fit , defined as the total best - fit flux in  and all other lines initially detected at @xmath60 divided by the quadrature - sum of the 1-@xmath19 noise from those line fits , and impose a cut in the total-@xmath55@xmath61 plane ( @xmath61 being the @xmath16 per degree of freedom in the fit ) .",
    "we cut any system with a total @xmath55 less than the greater of 6 and @xmath62 .",
    "this removes both low-@xmath55 candidates and candidates whose @xmath61 values are too high to be explained by high-@xmath55 emission features showing significant non - gaussian structure .",
    "( these cuts were designed to be a quantitative expression of our own judgements about which candidate systems look real upon spectrum inspection and which do not ; the justifications are somewhat _ a posteriori_. ) this cutting procedure reduces the 163 hits to 61 candidate systems .",
    "finally , we prune 12 candidates from the list that survive the automated culling but are clearly explained by either over - fit lrg stellar absorption , under - modeled lrg line emission , exceptionally poor data quality , or a generally flawed template fit , leaving the 49 good candidate systems that we present .",
    "this search for background galaxy emission lines digs rather deep into the noise of our spectroscopic sample . to gauge the incidence of false positives in our final candidate list",
    ", we make a parallel run of the detection , fitting , and automated rejection procedure with the following rest - wavelength perturbations : h@xmath3 @xmath4  @xmath63 4833 ,  @xmath63 4945 , and  @xmath63 5023 .",
    "these perturbations alter all of the redshift - independent wavelength ratios among these lines and between all of them and ; this modified detection procedure no longer selects for real multi - line emission , but only for noise features .",
    "the `` false candidates '' that result from this perturbed procedure are randomly shuffled along with the candidates from the original procedure , and all are examined together when making the final pruning judgements . the perturbed procedure yields 88 hits and 7 post - cut candidates ; all 7 are pruned upon inspection without knowledge of their intrinsic falseness .",
    "this implies that the vast majority of our candidates are indeed background galaxies and not simply noise features .",

    "finally , for each candidate system we report the detected background  line flux from the best - fit double gaussian profile , a list of other lines detected at @xmath22 , and the total @xmath55 of the background galaxy emission - line fit as defined in   [ select ] .",
    "the reported background line fluxes should be viewed with suspicion : the spatial alignments of the background galaxies are unknown , and the spectroscopic fibers will not necessarily have captured all of their light . in addition , most of the reduced candidate lrg spectra have been rescaled based on smear exposures that attempt to account for lrg flux falling outside the @xmath70 fiber @xcite ; we have removed this correction from the tabulated line fluxes , as it has no physical relation to the background emission - line galaxies .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the sdss discovery spectra and best - fit model spectra , along with close - up views of the residual ( data @xmath1 model ) spectra in the wavelength ranges corresponding to redshifted background , h@xmath3 @xmath4 , , and .",
    "smear corrections have not been removed from these plots .    although we detect line emission clearly , evidence of background galaxy _",
    "continuum _ in the residual spectra of our candidate systems is scarce .",
    "this is not surprising , for three reasons .",
    "one , the lrg sample was selected for particular broadband color and luminosity , and significant background continuum would likely perturb an lrg out of the sample .",
    "two , any faint background continuum present in an lrg spectrum will largely project onto the lrg - redshift eigenspectrum set and low - order polynomial fit used by specbs , and will be subtracted along with the lrg model when forming the residual spectrum .",
    "three , these background galaxies are likely to be high - equivalent - width star - forming systems , and since their line fluxes are detected just above the noise threshold , the associated continuum will typically be lost in the noise .",
    "nevertheless , we may obtain a higher signal - to - noise picture of the background galaxies that we detect by constructing a median spectrum as follows .",
    "first we transform the residual spectra of our candidate systems into units of erg  @xmath27  s@xmath26  pixel@xmath26 , which is a redshift - independent quantity since the sdss pixels are of constant velocity width .",
    "we then shift these residual spectra into the rest frame of the background galaxy , rounded to the nearest whole pixel , and transform back to erg  @xmath27  s@xmath26  @xmath26 .",
    "next we renormalize the spectra by dividing each one by its best - fit -flux value .",
    "we then take the median value at each pixel , and restore physical normalization by multiplying this median spectrum by the sample - median best - fit -flux value .",
    "the resulting median spectrum is shown in figure  [ medspec ] .",
    "although there is no discernible continuum in the individual residual spectra , we can see a 4000-continuum break in the median spectrum ; we also see h@xmath47 , h@xmath0 , [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] emission lines in addition to the lines for which we select .",
    "this gives further evidence that we have successfully detected and identified background emission features .",
    "we have with certainty detected emission from galaxies behind foreground lrgs . for a system to be a strong gravitational lens ,",
    "the background galaxy must be located at sufficiently small impact parameter relative to the lrg center .",
    "the true incidence of lensing within our sample can best be determined and studied with either narrow - band imaging or integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "such observations could spectrally isolate the background line flux and resolve it spatially to reveal any lensing morphology .",
    "sdss broadband imaging offers some hope for answering the lensing question , but in general sloan images do not detect late - type galaxies at redshift @xmath71 at very high @xmath55 . figure  [ ims ] shows @xmath72 sdss @xmath64 postage - stamp images centered on the candidate systems , with linear gray - scaling from @xmath73-@xmath19 sky noise to peak lrg surface brightness .",
    "evidence of significantly offset neighboring broadband emission is seen in some images , but it would be difficult to rule out many systems as definite non - lenses based on sdss - quality images . in the spirit of a purely spectroscopic survey , we present as candidates all systems selected spectroscopically .",
    "furthermore , we note that many of these lrgs live in high - density group / cluster environments , and neighboring images may be at the lrg redshift and not the source of the background emission that we detect .    in preparation for integral - field spectroscopic follow - up , we have obtained broadband reconnaissance images of 14 of our candidate systems ( as indicated in table  [ galtable ] ) using the magellan consortium s 6.5-m clay telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "these short @xmath74- and @xmath31-band exposures ( 120s each ) were taken on the nights of 2003 august 1 and 2 with the magellan instant camera ( magic ) ccd imager and active telescope optics @xcite .",
    "conditions were similar on both nights : non - photometric due to cirrus clouds , and with @xmath75 median fwhm seeing .",
    "for the majority of these systems , the images present no significant evidence for or against the presence of strong lensing ; we describe the exceptions here . one system , sdssj0035 , is almost certainly not a strong lens : a relatively @xmath74-bright galaxy can be seen clearly in the images , approximately @xmath76 offset from the lrg .",
    "this far exceeds the anticipated lensing scale of about @xmath77 reported in table  [ galtable ] .",
    "the images of sdssj2147 reveal a bluer galaxy approximately @xmath78 to the south , about at the limit of the estimated lensing scale .",
    "we see no particular evidence for strong lensing , but deeper observation of this system could be of interest .",
    "two systems , sdssj0037 and sdssj0216 , show evidence of multiple imaging .",
    "figure  [ diffims ] shows @xmath74-band images of these two systems , along with difference images created by smoothing aligned @xmath31-band images with a gaussian kernel in order to suppress noise and match the slightly worse @xmath74-band seeing , then fitting this smoothed @xmath31-band lrg image to the @xmath74-band image and subtracting it .",
    "the difference images are then smoothed with a gaussian kernel of fwhm @xmath79 in order to bring out coherent features ; they show strong evidence of multiply imaged , relatively blue sources .",
    "sdssj0037 seems likely to be a double - image lens .",
    "it is tempting to identify quadruple - image morphology in the sdssj0216 difference image , but the level of noise recommends caution .",
    "narrow - band imaging or integral - field spectroscopy should permit quantitative study of these systems and of those for which broadband imaging is inconclusive .",
    "_ hst _ imaging of any confirmed lenses using the narrow - band ramp filter set of the _ advanced camera for surveys _ could also be pursued to obtain a highly resolved picture of lensed line - emitting regions and permit even more detailed study of the lensing mass distributions .",
    "the degree of lensing that will be present in a particular system will depend on the impact parameter ( angular offset ) of the background galaxy in the source plane relative to the center of the lrg : the smaller the impact parameter , the more lensing will be seen . to obtain a rough estimate of the number of lenses within our sample , we can guess at the unlensed surface brightness distribution of our background galaxies , compute lensed images under an assumed lens model , smear to account for seeing , and integrate over the @xmath70-diameter sdss spectroscopic fiber , then compare to the [ o  ii ] line flux values that we have observed . to interpret the results in terms of lensing probabilities we must also invoke an luminosity function ( lf ) . appendix  [ lensprob ]",
    "describes the details of a lensing probability calculation of this nature that we have carried out .",
    "the results suggest that a total of 19 out of 49 systems are likely to be strong lenses  that is , we expect approximately 19 systems to have source - galaxy impact parameters less than the critical value for multiple imaging .",
    "it is important to recognize , though , that the `` lenses - or - not '' question does not have as straightforward an answer for extended sources as it does for point sources .",
    "different regions of our background galaxies will be lensed by different amounts , and in general some but not all of the galaxy can be multiply imaged .",
    "it is more appropriate to ask _ how much _ lensing is present in any given system .",
    "there is a sense in which the unknown degree of lensing in our systems may prove to be of scientific interest .",
    "@xcite raises the concern that current strong - lensing evidence for massive dark - matter halos in elliptical galaxies may reflect a selection bias .",
    "we quote directly : `` even if only a minority of ellipticals have massive dark halos , nearly all the observed lenses will belong to that minority . ''",
    "our lrg sample , in contrast , has not been selected for lensing , but rather for back - lighting .",
    "the true incidence of lensing within our sample will thus constitute a test of whether or not the dark halos in currently known lenses are in fact generic to early - type galaxies .",
    "we present a comparison between our lens candidate lrgs and the full 51,000 lrg spectroscopic sample in figure  [ lrgdist ] .",
    "the lens candidate lrgs seem somewhat skewed towards brighter magnitudes .",
    "the conservative interpretation is that the broadband selection properties of fainter lrgs are more easily perturbed by background galaxies , but it may also reflect a lensing signal , with more massive galaxies providing more magnification . if the logarithmic slope of the underlying [ o  ii ] lf is steeper than @xmath80 at the luminosities probed by our survey , then magnified lines of sight should show a statistically enhanced number of [ o  ii ] emitters @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the logarithmic [ o  ii ] lf slope to be steeper than @xmath80 for line luminosities @xmath81 ergs s@xmath26 , whereas the median observed [ o  ii ] luminosity in our sample is of order @xmath82 ergs s@xmath26 ( again , we have taken @xmath83 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 ) .",
    "these numbers suggest that magnification bias is not the explanation for the observed brightness of our lens candidates relative to the full lrg sample , but a more definite statement must await follow - up observations that capture the total background line flux .",
    "most known gravitational lens systems have been selected on the basis of some combination of source properties and lens cross section , whereas the sdss lrg sample is selected based on colors and magnitude .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare known early - type lens galaxies to our candidate lenses , although this is difficult since we do not currently have truly comparable observations of the two samples .",
    "figure  [ colormagvdispz ] presents our best attempt at such a comparison for lens velocity dispersions and apparent magnitudes as a function of redshift corrections . ] , with _",
    "hst _ known - lens data taken from @xcite .",
    "the known - lens velocity dispersions are estimated from lensed image separations in the manner described by @xcite ; they may be systematic overestimates if these lenses are superimposed on the `` mass sheet '' of a high - density environment @xcite .",
    "magnitude comparison is made by transforming sdss @xmath74- and @xmath64-band magnitudes to johnson - morgan @xmath84-band using the observed transformation of @xcite .",
    "we see that our lrg lens candidates are in general of greater velocity dispersion than known lenses , and in the redshift range where the two samples overlap , the lrgs are more luminous .",
    "the brightness of the lrgs combined with the relative faintness of the background galaxies in our sample suggests that any confirmed lrg lenses would be well suited to the type of detailed lens stellar - dynamical studies described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have presented a catalog of candidate strong galaxy - galaxy gravitational lens systems detected spectroscopically within the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "these systems have known foreground _ and _ background redshifts ; only the detailed spatial alignment of foreground and background galaxies remains unknown .",
    "we plan to conduct integral - field spectrographic follow - up observations of these systems , which will allow us to resolve the spatial distribution of the background nebular line emission that we have detected .",
    "these observations should confirm a substantial number of lenses within our candidate sample , with many lensed galaxies at lower redshift than any other currently known lensed extra - galactic optical sources .",
    "any lenses confirmed within our sample will be of considerable interest for the study of early - type galaxy mass distributions , and could have implications for lens - time - delay @xmath6 measurements and anomalous quasar - lens flux ratios .",
    "our sample demonstrates the feasibility of the emission - line - based spectroscopic lens search technique within the sdss and other redshift surveys , and we plan to extend the search to higher source redshifts in the near future .",
    "we have also developed and applied a method for abating the influence of night sky emission - line residuals in the 70009000-  range that allows us to detect [ o  iii ] and h@xmath3 emission over the redshift range @xmath85 0.40.8 without an excess of false - positive detections .",
