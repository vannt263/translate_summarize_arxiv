    "<S> in particular , we find a domain of discontinuity for the action that is strictly larger than the previously known domain of discontinuity .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of @xmath4 acting on character varieties or representation varieties is a blooming field of study . </S>",
    "<S> one motivation comes from the classical result that the mapping class group of a closed oriented surface @xmath7 of genus at least two acts properly discontinuously on @xmath8 the teichmller space of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> teichmller space @xmath8 is a component of the representation variety @xmath9 and together with @xmath10 the teichmller space of @xmath7 with the opposite orientation , form the set of discrete and faithful representations . </S>",

    "<S> a compression body is the boundary connect sum of a @xmath6-ball , a collection of @xmath13-bundles over closed surfaces and a handlebody where the other components are connected to the @xmath6-ball along disjoint discs . </S>",

    "<S> we show that pinching a masur domain curve or lamination on the boundary component are points in this domain of discontinuity .    </S>",
    "<S> canary - storm ( @xcite ) showed that whenever @xmath0 has an primitive essential annulus the action of @xmath4 can not be properly discontinuous on all of @xmath23 as compression bodies contain primitive essential annuli , one can not hope to obtain a domain of discontinuity for this action containing all of @xmath23    theorem [ compbody ] is a generalization of a result by minsky ( @xcite ) in the case when @xmath0 is a handlebody . </S>",
    "<S> he introduced the notion of primitive - stable representations and showed that if @xmath26 is a genus @xmath27 hyperbolizable handlebody , then the set of primitive - stable representations , denoted @xmath28 , is a domain of discontinuity for the action of @xmath29 containing the interior of @xmath30 as well as points on @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the free group on @xmath27 generators . </S>",

    "<S> the incompressible boundary case was resolved by canary - storm ( @xcite ) , canary - magid ( @xcite ) and lee ( @xcite ) ; they showed that in this case , there exists an open @xmath4-invariant set , containing the interior of @xmath21 and points on the boundary of @xmath21 , on which @xmath4 acts properly discontinuously if and only if @xmath0 is not a trivial @xmath13-bundle over a closed orientable hyperbolic surface .    </S>",

    "<S> as it is difficult to procure , we give proofs of many of the results we use . in section [ nonhomeo ] , we study further the structure of @xmath25 and show that when @xmath0 is a large compression body , there exist connected components of @xmath25 that coincide with components of the interior of @xmath23    * acknowledgements : * the results in this paper form part of the author s ph.d . </S>",
