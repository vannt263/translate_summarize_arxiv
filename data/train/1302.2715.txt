    "there is a widely accepted idea that the solar magnetic activity , which is itself manifested in the quasiperiodic variation of sunspot number and other similar tracers , results from the dynamo waves of quasistationary magnetic field propagating in solar interior .",
    "differential rotation which stretches the toroidal magnetic field from poloidal is an obvious driver for the solar dynamo .",
    "differential rotation alone is not capable of exciting the dynamo .",
    "additional drivers which can create poloidal fields from toroidal ones are required .",
    "symmetry arguments brought parker ( 1955 ) to the idea that the collective action of the cyclonic motions ( associated with the @xmath0-effect ) in the solar convection zone can transform the toroidal component of the large - scale magnetic field to poloidal .",
    "steenbeck , krause and rdler ( see krause and rdler , 1980 ) provided the mathematical basis for this idea .",
    "it was found that the @xmath0-effect results from the breaking of the reflection symmetry of the convective flows due to the global rotation .",
    "currently , several different kinds of @xmath0-effect are widely used in solar dynamo models . the flux - transport and the babcock - leighton types of dynamo",
    "employ a nonlocal @xmath0-effect , which results from the coriolis force acting on flux - tubes rising in the solar convection zone ( see , e.g. , choudhuri et al . 1995 ; dikpati and charbonneau 1999 ) .",
    "they show that this kind of dynamo can operate in the sun in conjunction with meridional circulation . in mean - field",
    "dynamos the @xmath0-effect works _ in situ_. it is more then plausible ( dikpati and gilman , 2001 ) that both effects contribute to solar dynamo action , and their relative importance differs between normal cycles and the grand minimum epochs .",
    "anyway , the physical nature of the dynamo driver which connects toroidal magnetic field with poloidal remains an important problem in solar dynamo theory .",
    "helioseismology provides a substantial observational basis which can illuminate the properties of the solar rotation .",
    "the driver of the poloidal magnetic field in the solar dynamo is much less well known than the differential rotation which largely drives the toroidal field , because it is weaker and requires more sophisticated observational schemes .",
    "seehafer ( 1990 ) suggested that the current helicity in solar active regions can be a tracer of the reflection symmetry breaking in the solar dynamo .",
    "it has required about twenty years of intensive efforts to obtain a more or less clear message for dynamo studies from observations of the current helicity observations ( see e.g. zhang et al .",
    "currently , the nature of the the poloidal magnetic field on the sun remains a matter of intensive discussions .",
    "in particular , solar dynamo models must assume fairly arbitrarily the value and form of the regeneration of poloidal magnetic field from toroidal , and the corresponding regeneration rate is a crucial governing parameter for the solar dynamo .",
    "therefore , there is a fundamental interest in getting observational information concerning the induction mechanisms of the poloidal magnetic field in the solar dynamo , in order to learn which mechanism is most important .",
    "an obvious relevant tracer here is the tilt angle of bipolar sunspot groups . as early as 1919 ( hale et al . , 1919 )",
    "joy s law stated that that active sunspot regions tend to be `` tilted '' , with the leading spot closer to the equator than the following spot .",
    "this law gives , quite straightforwardly , the desired link between toroidal and poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the importance of the joy s law is that it gives the result of the combined action of all sources contributing to the desired link between toroidal and poloidal fields , while the other tracers ( say , kinetic helicity ) illuminate contributions of particular mechanisms to the joint result .    in spite of the fact that joy s law is as old as the famous hale polarity law , its impact on solar dynamo theory remained quite limited until recently , simply because the tilt angle data are much noisier than the sunspot polarity data .",
    "recently , the accumulation of observational data and the progress of observational techniques , in particular due to the soho / mdi high resolution magnetograms , has provided sufficient data . this can be used to suppress the noise by averaging , and gives convincing results concerning joy s law . in our opinion ,",
    "the breakthrough was achieved in the fundamental paper by stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) , who convinced at least the solar dynamo community that the observations available allow the extraction of tilt angles with a reasonable level of confidence .",
    "stenflo and kosovichev ( 2012 ) presented tilt angle as a function of solar latitude averaged over the solar cycle . in general , their results look quite consistent with expectations from solar dynamo theory .",
    "we believe that the available data enables us to make a further step and to clarify details of the temporal and latitudinal evolution of the tracers during the course of the solar cycle , as well as to learn the contribution in the tracer from bipolar sunspot groups of various intensities .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the result of such an investigation , and to discuss it in the context of solar dynamos .    in presenting our results",
    "we exploit the standard methods in current helicity studies ( zhang et al .",
    "2010 ) , and obtain tilt angles averaged over latitudinal and temporal bins overlaid on the sunspot butterfly diagram .",
    "according to the current naive understanding of solar dynamo theory we do not expect to see in such a diagram any very dramatic behaviour of the averaged tilt angle . in this sense",
    "we confirm and extend the conclusion of stenflo & kosovichev ( as well as the earlier conclusion of sivaraman et al .",
    "1999 ) that the tilt angle does not vary dramatically during the course of the cycle .",
    "in contrast , we obtain , quite unexpectedly in the context of dynamo studies , that the tilt angle depends dramatically on the intensity of the bipolar group . here",
    "we confirm and develop the preliminary conclusions of tlatov and obridko ( 2012 ) .",
    "we present an interpretation of our results in the context of solar dynamo modelling .",
    "we base our analysis on the magnetograms from kitt peak vacuum telescope ( kpvt ) , soho / mdi data ( scherrer et al , 1995 ; soi.stanford.edu/magnetic/lev1.8/ ) .",
    "in addition , we check the part of the obtained results by using fits files of 720-second cadence hmi data ( schou et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "each magnetogram gives a map of the line - of - sight component of the magnetic flux density averaged over the spatial resolution window .",
    "we skipped from our analysis the magnetograms that have defected pixels ( e.g. , after the solar flares ) .",
    "the magnetograms that cover only part of the solar disk were skipped , as well .    similar to tlatov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and , also , stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) , we use a computer algorithm to isolate bipolar regions in solar magnetograms .",
    "the algorithm we use was suggested by tlatov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and allows isolation of bipolar groups with low surface area or magnetic flux .",
    "this is why our data sample is richer than that analyzed by stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) , and it is essential in getting a tilt butterfly diagram .",
    "stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) isolated about @xmath1 bipoles from about @xmath2 magnetograms , i.e. about 14 magnetograms per day , and so a rate of about 2 bipoles per day .",
    "they considered active regions only . because the lifetime of active regions substantially exceeds 1 day , the tilt information is redundant in that the tilt of a given bipole is measured many times .",
    "our database for the same period 1996 - 2011 ( mdi data ) contains about @xmath3 bipoles from about @xmath4 magnetograms , i.e. 1 magnetogram per day , and so about 15 bipoles per day . for the period 1975 - 2003 ( kpvt data  3 cycles ) we obtained about @xmath5 bipoles . to verify that these samples are not affected by noise or other known issues of mdi data ( liu and norton , 2001 ) we used additionally hmi data ( 2010 - 2012 ) , from which we obtained about @xmath6 bipoles ( 1 magnetogram per day ) .",
    "apart from sunspot groups , our bipoles represent small ephemeral regions .    for the sake of consistency we recall here the basic elements of the algorithm suggested by tlatov et al .",
    "the image with an example of the recognized bipolar groups can be found in the above cited paper    in step 1 , we look through the data set a for each magnetogram , we sift defective pixels do one nearest - neighbor smoothing ( see tlatov et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "then , we select the monopole domains with magnetic field exceeding the threshold level @xmath7 for positive and negative values of @xmath7 separately . for each connected domain",
    "the following parameters are then calculated : the heliographic coordinates of the geometrical center of the domain including the projection effect , its area measured in millionths of the solar hemisphere ( msh @xmath8 .",
    "the round shaped spot with area s ( in msh ) has a diameter @xmath9 @xmath10 = @xmath11 .",
    "see vitinsky et al .",
    ", 1986 . ] ) , and the magnetic flux through this area .",
    "the next stage is to search for a domain of given polarity ( domain 1 ) and a corresponding domain ( domain 2 ) of the opposite polarity .",
    "we sift the structures with area less than 20 msh from the search the search is performed in a circular region whose center is located at the geometrical center of the initial domain and with radius @xmath12 on the solar disc , where @xmath13 is a longitudinal size of this domain .",
    "note that the value of @xmath14 corresponds to the mean distance between pores in bipolar sunspot groups of the zrich class b ( vitinsky et al .",
    "it looks reasonable to introduce a criterion that both domains have more or less equal magnetic fluxes , i.e. @xmath15 , and to require that that the distance between the corresponding domains is minimal . each search is started with an arbitrary pole of positive polarity .",
    "for this element the program finds the best neighbor match for the negative polarity pole .",
    "after this , a reverse search is performed to find the closest neighbor for the negative pole . if the search returns the same pair of negative and positive poles , the pair is marked and is taken out of the next search .",
    "the search was restricted to the central zone , within @xmath16 from the central meridian of solar disc .     finally , we calculate the tilt angle @xmath17 as the angle between a line connecting the geometrical centre of the domain with the negative polarity with the centre of the domain with positive polarity in a bipolar group , and the solar equator .",
    "we associate the tilt with the bisecting point of this line .",
    "if the leading polarity is positive the tilt is close to @xmath18 while if the leading polarity is negative the tilt is near @xmath19 .",
    "tlatov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) demonstrated that the algorithm is quite robust .",
    "examples of the identified bipoles are given in fig .",
    "[ bip ] . of course",
    ", it can sometimes give identifications that look irrelevant , especially for small bipoles .",
    "however the main statistical properties seem reliable to within a general level of noise .",
    "basically we used one magnetogram per day , but for the mdi data set we made an additional check with 7 magnetogram per day and find the same results ( within the level of noise ) .",
    "the given results were confirmed by the procedure where the search domain was restricted to the central zone within @xmath20 from the central meridian of the solar disc . these support the conclusion about robustness of the principal algorithm .",
    "as opposed to stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) we used significantly lower smoothing and lower values of threshold levels for magnetic field .",
    "we obtained individual substantive domains with appropriate coordinates and fluxes .",
    "it allow us to perform an analysis for substantially smaller structures versus stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) .",
    "there are also some differences in determination of tilt angle .",
    "we calculate tilt between two domains with similar fluxes rather then between geometric averaged fields with different directions that usually consist of many unconnected regions inside the box used by stenflo & kosovichev ( 2012 ) .",
    "additional information obtained during the identification of the groups allows separation of groups of given ranges of areas .",
    "obviously , it is useful for the analysis to obtain as many bipoles as possible . on the other hand , as more bipoles are collected weaker bipoles have to be included in the database .",
    "we recognize that it is difficult to determine mean tilt for weak bipoles , because the tilt angle distribution is almost homogeneous .",
    "we expect , and confirm the expectation by the following analysis , that some features of bipole distribution become unstable if the weakest bipoles are included .",
    "therefore we set a lower limit on the area of bipoles - they should exceed 50 msh .",
    "smaller bipoles require more sophisticated analysis .",

    "we demonstrate the correctness of our selection of small and large bipolar groups as follows .",

    "obviously , the tilt for a given bipolar region is a quite noisy quantity and we are interested in the tilt data averaged over suitable latitudinal and temporal intervals .    for averaging we use 2-year time bins and @xmath27 latitudinal bins and then consider the data for a given activity cycle as required .",
    "an example of the tilt angle distribution for a given time - latitude bin is shown in fig .",
    "[ dist ] .",
    "in averaging the distribution we have to take into account that the method applied to measure the tilt can give rare and strong non - gaussian deviations from the mean .",

    "this happens only in about 5% of cases ( e.g. sokoloff and khlystova , 2010 ) .",
    "the relative number of small bipoles that violate the polarity law is larger than that for sunspot groups , about 1020% and they quite usually give an additional maximum in the tilt angle distribution , displaced from the primary by @xmath28 however the tilt is usually quite close to @xmath18 or @xmath19 and we discard rare and strong non - gaussian deviations .     for areas @xmath23 msh ( weighted data ) .",
    "the vertical line indicates the median of sample .",

    "we perform this averaging as follows . in the first step , we select for a given bin a hemisphere , either east ( tilts @xmath29 ) or west ( tilts @xmath30 ) , from where the tilt data are taken for averaging .",
    "we approximate the tilt distribution in each hemisphere by the gaussian @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is an amplitude , @xmath33 is a mean , and @xmath34 is a standard deviation , and choose the hemisphere where @xmath32 is larger . as a rule this means that the number of tilts which are directed in this hemisphere is larger than directed in the opposite hemisphere . if desirable , we can weight the data using , say , the areas of the bipoles .    in the second step",
    "we apply the robust statistical measure ( median ) to estimate the desired mean value and corresponding uncertainties .",
    "we order the tilt angles from the bin as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and take @xmath37 as the averaged quantity @xmath38 for the tilt if @xmath39 is odd and @xmath40 , if @xmath39 is even . for large @xmath39",
    "the estimate becomes gaussian with mean @xmath38 and standard deviation @xmath41 and then we can estimate uncertainties using the standard student criterion with @xmath42 degree of freedom ( see huber 1981 ) .",
    "note that the number of large bipoles in our sample decreases sharply with the growth of bipole area . in order to increase the contribution of the largest bipoles ( including sunspots ) to the average we use weighting .",

    "solar dynamo theories include a physical link between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic field , which results in a non - vanishing tilt .",
    "the nature of this link is specific for any particular dynamo scenario . in the parker ( 1955 )",
    "scenario it is a result of the @xmath0-effect arising from the mirror - asymmetric solar convection , while the babcock - leighton scenario ( babcock , 1961 , leighton , 1961 ) exploits a direct action of the coriolis force on the rising magnetic loop .",
    "this can be interpreted as a nonlocal @xmath0-effect .",
    "the direct numerical simulations by brandenburg ( 2005 ) suggest another possibility .",
    "his results suggest that near the solar surface the @xmath0-effect can be dominated by effects of the shear , and the tilt angle is a result of the latitudinal differential rotation . except for the mechanisms mentioned above",
    ", both mean - field theory and direct numerical simulations suggests the existence of additional induction effects of the turbulence , which could transform the toroidal magnetic field to poloidal and vice versa .",
    "the @xmath62 effect ( rdler , 1969 )  also called the @xmath63-effect  originates from the coriolis force acting on the current , and is induced by the turbulent magnetic field linked with the large - scale field ( see , e.g. , pipin & seehafer 2009 ) .",
    "direct numerical simulations confirm the importance of the @xmath63-effect as well as the @xmath64 effect for the global dynamo in the convective zone of a star ( kpyl et al 2008 , 2009 ; schrinner et al 2011 , 2012 ) .    of course , details of the time - latitude distribution of the tilt depend on particular features of the model and the scenario as a whole .",
    "it looks plausible that the tilt data can help to determine which scenario or combinations fits the true solar activity better ( e.g. dasi - espuig ( 2010 ) claim that the tilt data support the babcock - leighton scenario ) .",
    "our feeling is that a final decision here needs extensive numerical modelling in light of the tilt data obtained , and so we reserve our opinion here and use below the notation @xmath0 as a common notation for the link between toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields in either picture .    from the viewpoint of dynamo theory ,",
    "the tilt data can be considered as a direct observational determination of the principal drivers in solar dynamo , i.e. the @xmath0-effect ( or , more carefully , of a mirror - asymmetric driver responsible for conversion of toroidal magnetic field to the poloidal ) .",
    "our results confirm the basic expectations of dynamo models concerning properties of @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity is antisymmetric in respect to the equator , it increases with latitude and does not demonstrate pronounced cycle - to - cycle variations . some variations of @xmath0 within the cycle can be attributed to nonlinear suppression of dynamo action .",

    "it changes sign to become negative near the bottom of the convection zone .    we can estimate the absolute value of @xmath0 as follows .",
    "the typical tilt does not exceed @xmath65  about @xmath66 of the extent of the first quadrant , @xmath67 , where the tilt of the given sign can , principle , vary .",
    "if we identify the life time of bipoles with the convection turnover time and suggest that a convective vortex performs a full rotation during the turnover time , we find that @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the r.m.s .",
    "convective velocity .",
    "a more accurate estimate requires detailed numerical modelling and is constrained by the bias discussed above ; however the range of @xmath0 obtained looks consistent with the concepts of dynamo theory .    in any case",
    "we can conclude that @xmath0 is no longer just a theoretical concept supported only by theoretical findings , but has now a direct observational confirmation .",
    "our results do not clarify the physical nature of @xmath0 directly , but further modelling of the dynamo based on the data obtained in the framework of other relevant data can , in principle , help to decide a relevant option .",
    "such modelling however is obviously out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the tilt data associated with small bipoles show that these have a sign of tilt which is opposite to the tilt sign derived from the data for large bipoles . comparing the distribution of the tilts of the small bipoles shown in fig.s [ dist_s15 ] and [ dist_s35 ]",
    "we conclude that the origin of the negative tilt is different at low and high latitudes .",
    "in fact , at low ( @xmath70 ) latitudes the negative tilt is caused not by the sign of the maximum of the distribution , but by the more populated tail of the distribution .",
    "we can interpret this as a mixture of two populations .",
    "this is different to results by stenflo & kosovichev(2012 ) , who found that small bipoles follows to the standard joy s law being oriented in the same direction as the sunspots .",
    "one is located in the area of positive angles ( standard bipoles ) and defines the maximum of the distribution , whereas another is located in the area of negative angles and shifts the mean tilt . at higher latitudes ( @xmath71 ) the number of standard bipoles with positive tilts ( which are supposed to trace the toroidal magnetic field ) decreases and",
    "we see the prevalent component with negative tilt .",
    "these results complement the study by tlatov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who found that the size of population of the oriented small bipoles starts to grow at the latitudes larger than 20@xmath72 just after the solar maximum having the polar and equatorial branches of activity .",
    "it was claimed that this support an idea about an extended solar cycle .",
    "we can speculate about another possibility .",
    "extending the idea given by brandenburg ( 2005 ) , we can assume , that at higher latitudes we observe tracers of poloidal component of the solar magnetic field that is converted by the @xmath64 mechanism into the toroidal field .",
    "indeed , such bipoles , being initially oriented in the meridional direction , can obtain negative tilts from to the action of the coriolis force .",
    "for meridionally oriented bipoles the coriolis force is minimal near the equator and maximal near the poles , hence the tilt should decrease towards the poles and we should again see joy s law .",
    "we can see such behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the curve of joy s law has a visible bend at @xmath73 .",
    "of course , other mechanisms , for instance differential rotation , can affect the tilt distribution and cause difficulties for the sign determination , especially at lower latitudes .",
    "we appreciate that the criteria for bipole definition and averaging can be varied to some extent .",
    "these variations affect the tilt distribution of the larger dipoles more weakly than for the smaller .",
    "we used median as a robust statistic and student criteria for confidence intervals .",
    "this method confirmed the first estimations in tlatov et al .",
    "however we failed to find a convincing scheme of data processing which would give positive tilt for the small bipoles in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the choice of criteria which we used to obtain the the above results is one of the most severe in respect to obtaining a negative tilt of small bipoles in the northern hemisphere .",
    "this conclusion is supported by consideration of the newest observational data provided by hmi .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows . for bipoles with larger area ,",
    "the tilt angle is positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern , with a latitudinal profile proportional to @xmath74 . in comparing our results with those by tlatov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we found that the bipoles with smaller area are non - homogeneous and can be decomposed into two populations .",
    "one of them is associated with the bipoles that follow the standard tilt angle law and contains mostly sunspots at the early stages of their evolution .",
    "another group is constituted mainly of the ephemeral regions and has a tilt angle which is of opposite sign to the tilt of the bipoles of larger area .",
    "the tilt of bipoles of the second group is produced by specific mechanisms , and some possible explanations have been discussed above .",
    "the ratio between two groups depends on the latitude zone considered . at low latitudes bipoles of the first group dominate , but the second group provides a heavy tail to the tilt distribution . at high latitudes the number of sunspots vanishes and the second group dominates .",
    "extending the results of the previous studies ( see , tlatov et al , 2010 ; stenflo & kosovichev , 2012 ; and by tlatov & obridko , 2012 ) we found that the tilt angle distribution remains stable showing no substantial variations from one cycle to another .     finally , we summarize what is the new message from our paper to dynamo theory in comparison to that one from stenflo & kosovichev , 2012 .",
    "we focus the attention on the variations tilt angle distribution in course of a given cycle to found that this distribution remains rather stable and deviations from this general distribution are quite small and local . in this respect ,",
    "tilt angle differs substantially from the current helicity which traces mirror asymmetry of magnetic field ( zhang et al . ,",
    "this simple behaviour of the tilt means that the simple models of solar dynamo based on primitive parameterization of the regeneration rate of poloidal magnetic field from toroidal one and simple phenomenological algebraic quenching of this regeneration rate reproduce rather well the true phenomenology . of course , such models do not clarify physical mechanisms underlying the phenomenon however provide a reasonable pragmatic approach to its description",
    "we believe that the tilt angle data presented can be used in order to improve such simplified models for stellar dynamos and historical reconstructions of solar activity . in principle",
    ", we would be happy to achieve this limited however important goal .",
    "in fact however we isolated an unusual behaviour of small bipoles .",
    "we explain it as a manifestation of regeneration of toroidal magnetic field from poloidal one due to the mirror asymmetric effects in solar dynamo .",
    "if this interpretation will be supported by future investigations , it will give a completely new source of observational information concerning governing parameters of solar dynamo .",
    "we stress that an independent verification of the results concerning small bipoles by other methods of bipole recognition is highly desirable before a dynamo interpretation of this result can be robustly supported or rejected .",
