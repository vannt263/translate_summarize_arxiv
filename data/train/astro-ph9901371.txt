    "recent spectro - imaging x - ray observations of central compact sources in supernova remnants ( snrs ) challenge earlier notions that most young neutron stars ( nss ) evolve in a manner similar to the prototypical crab pulsar ( gotthelf 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , the latest compilations shows that most of such associated objects manifest properties distinct from those of the crab - like systems .    based on observational grounds alone ,",
    "three classes of nss in snrs are known whose flux is dominated by their x - ray emission ; these include the x - ray pulsars with anomalously slow rotation ( with periods in the range of @xmath1 s ) and steep ( @xmath2 ) power - law spectra ( gregory & fahlman 1980 ; gotthelf & vasisht 1998 and refs .",
    "therein ) , the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( cline  1982 ; kulkarni  1994 ; vasisht  1994 ) , and a population of radio - quiet nss in remnants ( caraveo  1996 ; petre  1996 ; mereghetti  1996 ) .",
    "the above objects are linked by their apparent radio - quiet nature , and taken collectively , may help further reconcile the ns birth rate with the observed snr census . in this study",
    "we focus on the enigmatic x - ray source  in the snr , for which no clear interpretation yet exists within the above taxonomic framework .",
    "the _ einstein _  x - ray source  lies near the projected center of the bright , young ( @xmath3 yrs ; carter  1997 ) galactic shell - type snr  ( g332.4 - 0.4 ) and has been proposed as the first example of an isolated , cooling ns ( tuohy & garmire 1980 ) .",
    "it was discovered using the high resolution imager ( hri ) but went unseen by a prior _ einstein _  ipc observation and a subsequent _ rosat _  pspc one , supposedly due to the poorer spatial resolution of these instruments .",
    "surprisingly , an initial observation with the _ rosat _  hri also failed to detect the source ; this was attributed to the reduced hri sensitivity of the 10 off - axis pointing ( becker 1993 ) .",
    "finally , a 1993 _ asca _  observation re - discovered this elusive object ( gotthelf , petre & hwang 1997 , gph97 herein ) , but its spectral characteristics were found to be incompatible with a simple cooling ns model .",
    "this re - detection has been confirmed by more recent , on - axis , _ rosat _  hri observations .    herein , we present the results of our follow - up ( sep 1997 ) _ asca _  observation of .",
    "in the same field lies the recently discovered 69 ms pulsar ax  j161730 - 505505 ( torii  1998 ) , whose analysis is presented separately ( torii  1999 ) .",
    "while both sources are detected again , the flux from  has declined significantly since the previous _ asca _  measurement .",
    "we discuss some implications of this large flux variability on the nature of .",
    "a day - long follow - up observation with the _ asca _  observatory ( tanaka  1994 ) of  was carried out on 1997 september 4 .",
    "data were acquired with both the solid - state ( siss ) and gas scintillation spectrometers ( giss ) .",
    "the essential properties of these instruments are qualified in gph97 .",
    "the sis data were acquired in 1-ccd bright mode with  placed as close to the mean sis telescope bore - sight as was practical , to minimize vignetting losses .",
    "the gis data were collected in the highest time - resolution mode ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 , depending on the telemetry mode ) , with reduced spectral binning of @xmath6 ev per pha channel .",
    "the effective , filtered observation time is @xmath7  ks for each gis(sis ) sensor . the new data were reduced and analyzed with the same methodology as in gph97 .",
    "we compared images of  from our new observation with the asca images obtained four years earlier .",
    "the flux - corrected gis images from the two epochs , restricted to the hard energy band - pass ( @xmath0 kev ) , are displayed in figure 1 using an identical intensity scale .",
    "both reveal a pair of distinct features , each having a spatial distribution consistent with that of a point source ; one at the position of , and the other at the position of the 69 ms x - ray pulsar ax  j161730 - 505505 ( due north ) ; the flux of the latter has evidently remained constant ( see torii  1999 for details ) .",
    "however , we estimate that  has dimmed a factor @xmath8 in the hard band , after the diffuse flux from the remnant has been taken into account using the following method .    the soft x - ray flux ( below 2 kev )",
    "is dominated by steady thermal emission from shock - heated gas in the remnant .",
    "the contribution of this component to the hard - band images is estimated using the soft - band images .",
    "the latter provides a good model for the spatial distribution of the surrounding shell on arcminute scales in the @xmath0 kev range . the soft - band contribution from",
    "the shell was renormalized to the hard - band , and subtracted from the flux calibrated hard - band image to extract the flux contribution from the source alone . for the comparison",
    ", the new data were rebinned by a factor of 4 ( @xmath9 pixels ) to match the binning used with the earlier observation .",
    "the longer exposure of the second observation results in increased sensitivity to , however , this gain is offset by its location at a greater off - axis angle ( as is evident by the asymmetrical psf ) relative to the first observation .",
    "an equivalent analysis of the sis data reproduces the variability seen in the gis hard band .",
    "we analyzed the spectrum from the new observation using the same approach presented in gph97 .",
    "to maximize the sensitivity , we simultaneously fit the spectra from all four _ asca _  detectors .",
    "we restricted our sis spectral fits to @xmath10 kev as the calibration at the lower energies has become less reliable over time .",
    "the improved viewing geometry over the previous observation , coupled with the spectral stacking ( four detectors ) , made it possible to measure the spectrum , despite the lower source flux ( only one sis data set was used in the earlier spectral analysis ) .",
    "the resulting fits to simple models ( table i ) are consistent with those inferred for the first observation .",
    "thus , while the flux has decreased by an order of magnitude , the spectrum appears essentially unchanged .      to investigate its long - term flux behavior",
    ", we constructed a light curve of  which spans 18 years ( @xmath11 ) , using 10 available archival observations .",
    "for each observation , we extracted background - subtracted countrates or 3@xmath12 upper limits .",
    "these rates are then used to estimate the flux in a given energy band . for lack of knowledge to the contrary",
    ", we assume that the spectral shape is invariant in time and modeled by a blackbody whose parameters are given in table 1 . the best - fit power - law model is unphysical at the softer x - ray energies and thus the blackbody model is preferred for this comparison .",
    "we folded the latter model through the spectral response function of each instrument using the xspec spectral fitting package and inferred the source flux for each observation in a fiducial @xmath13 kev energy band .",
    "the results , listed in table 2 and plotted in fig .",
    "2 , confirm a dramatic flux change between the _ asca _  observations , and suggest that  is variable , to a lesser extent , amongst the other observations .",
    "we present this source flux comparison among instruments with some caution , as these can be potentially unreliable .",
    "the different energy bands , flux calibrations , point response functions , and background contamination can produce large uncertainties in the derived fluxes . when extrapolating , the relative count rates are very sensitive to the instrumental energy band , along with the assumed @xmath14 and emission model . however , our fundamental result stands regardless of the aforementioned caveats : the _ asca _  data alone , and to a lesser extent the _ rosat _  data , establish the fact that varied throughout the time it has been observed .",
    "the excursions in flux noted from observations separated by months or years suggest that variability might be present on shorter time - scales .",
    "we searched the day - long _ asca _",
    "observations for hour - scale temporal variability .",
    "in addition , we examined the behavior on a timescale of a few days using the august , 1995 , _ rosat _",
    "hri observation , with a net exposure time of 50 ks spread over a week . in neither case",
    "did we find evidence of variability greater than the photon statistic limit of 10 percent .",
    "we searched the new _ asca _  gis data for a coherent pulsed signal , as in gph97 .",
    "no significant periodicity was found in the period space between 10 ms - 1000 s. the upper limit on the pulsed fraction for this data set is @xmath15 23% , compared with the 13% limit of gph97 .",
    "the data show no clear evidence for accretion noise such as redness in the power spectrum .",
    "the data were searched for x - ray bursts and other anomalies in the light curve , but none were found .",
    "a number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the nature of . upon discovery ,",
    "this source was proposed as an isolated neutron star emitting blackbody radiation ( tuohy & garmire 1980 ) .",
    "further optical and radio observations ( e.g. tuohy  1983 ; dickel 1996 ) have failed to identify a counterpart , thereby bolstering this interpretation .",
    "the observations of gph97 showed that the point source could be described as a hot blackbody of @xmath16 kev and a @xmath17 kev flux of @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 ; therefore a luminosity of @xmath21 erg s@xmath20 ( at 3.3 kpc ) and an effective emitting area of @xmath22 km@xmath23 , or @xmath24% the surface area of a ns .",
    "this corresponds to a rather small hot - spot on a stellar surface , which is in turn surprising since the source shows no rotational modulation ( down to @xmath25% ) . also , the inferred temperature is too high for an object of age few @xmath26 yrs ( but see below ) .",
    "heyl & hernquist ( 1998 ) recently attempted to salvage the cooling ns model by invoking an ultra - magnetized star ( @xmath27 g ) with an accreted hydrogen atmosphere ( page 1997 , for a review ) .",
    "this combination can enhance the cooling flux as well as shift the emission bluewards ( chabrier , potekhin & yakov 1997 ) so that it effectively mimics a hot blackbody in the _ asca _  spectrum .",
    "however , it is hard for cooling models to address the issue of variability or the flux decimation observed between the _ asca _  epochs , unless there is a source for rejuvenating the heating of the ns interior",
    ". such a source could be the super - strong magnetic field , implicit in the above model .",
    "episodic rearrangement of the field ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) in the stellar interior could provide the energy to impulsively heat the core",
    ".    the stellar surface would re - adjust to reflect the internal heating on a short thermal timescale of a few months .",
    "although heating of the ns is viable in this scenario , the rapid cooling on a timescale of a few years , observed between the _ asca _  epochs , can not be explained without some very `` exotic '' cooling process .",
    "in addition , a factor of 10 variability in the hard ( @xmath28 kev ) band would result in a downward shift of the effective temperature by a factor 1.4 , which should have been detected . on these grounds",
    ", we reject the hypothesis that the observed x - ray emission from  is simple cooling radiation .",
    "an ultra - magnetized ns is also a leading model for the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , an example of which is the @xmath29 yr - old , 12-s x - ray pulsar in the remnant kes 73 ( vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ) .",
    "gph97 compared  to the latter on the basis of similar spectral characteristics . and",
    "at least two axps are reported to vary significantly in flux , by as much as a factor of five ( 1e  1048.1 - 593 ; oosterbroek  1998 ) .",
    "while  shows some properties that are tantalizingly similar to those of the axps , the lack of observed strong pulsations ( @xmath30 modulation for the axps ) is notably amiss , particularly as a large magnetic field should result in highly anisotropic surface emission .",
    "gravitational defocusing and/or unfavorable viewing geometry , however , might account for the lack of observed pulsations .",
    "alternatively , the variability can be indicative of an accreting compact object .",
    "popov ( 1997 ) suggests that  is an old accreting ns with a low magnetic field and long spin period ( @xmath31 s ) , the by - product of a disrupted binary and not of the same age as .",
    "this proposition is bolstered by the discovery of the nearby 69 ms pulsar ax  j161730 - 505505 ( spindown age of @xmath32 yrs ) , located outside the remnant shell ( torii  1998 ) .",
    "several arguments , including those based on the pulsar s implied velocity and lack of wind nebula , and the symmetry of the snr , however , make an association unlikely ( kaspi  1998 , torii  1999 ) .",
    "finally , there exists the possibility that the source is an isolated stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) , accreting from the surrounding medium or from supernova ejecta fall - back .",
    "brown & bethe ( 1994 ) have discussed scenarios in which a massive progenitor explodes as a supernova and then evolves into a bh of several solar masses after accreting captured ejecta .",
    "such a scenario is clearly applicable to the source in .",
    "temporal variability and lack of pulsed emission are the natural consequences in such a model .",
    "an accretion process around a bh almost inevitably involves rotating gas flows .",
    "popov ( 1997 ) has dismissed the possibility of a few stellar - mass bh in  based on the small implied emitting area ( @xmath33 km@xmath23 ) of an equivalent blackbody radiator ( see  4 ) .",
    "this argument would certainly apply for the case of the standard optically - thick , thin - disk model .",
    "however , low - efficiency solutions can exist for accretion flows ( especially at low @xmath34 ) around bhs , in which most of the viscously generated thermal energy is advected into the bh .",
    "below a critical mass accretion rate of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the eddington rate ) accretion flows turn advection dominated ( or adaf ) , and the observed luminosity in would suggest an accretion rate of @xmath37   ( or @xmath38 @xmath39 yr@xmath20 ) ( cf adaf models summarized in narayan  1998 ) . at this rate , the bh would accrete @xmath40 @xmath39 of matter , a small fraction of the mass of supernova ejecta , at the sustained present rate over its lifetime of @xmath31 yr . within the framework of the above arguments , it is possible that flow around",
    "could be detected as a faint optical source ( v @xmath41 22 after accounting for visual extinction ) or a 10 - 100 @xmath42jy ( 1 ghz ) radio source .",
    "the variability of the x - ray emission from the compact source in leaves little room for a conventional cooling ns origin . instead",
    ", an accretion scenario may be considered , although the relatively low luminosity , lack of optical counterpart , and young age are inconsistent with a typical accreting ns binary .",
    "accretion from a very low mass ( @xmath430.1 m@xmath44 ) companion ( mereghetti  1996 ; baykal & swank 1996 ) or a fossil disk around a solitary ns ( van paradijs  1995 ) , however , is not ruled out .",
    "we suggest that within the context of inefficient accretion ( such as advection dominated flows ) , a stellar mass black hole is a viable possibility .",
    "we reiterate , however , that the spectral characteristics of  are remarkably similar to those of the axps , which are suspected to be ultra - magnetized nss and thought to be powered by magnetic field decay rather than rotational braking ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ) .",
    "independent of the above phenomenology , the properties of  add to the view that young collapsed stars can follow an evolutionary scenario quite distinct from those of crab - like pulsars .",
    "the property of being radio quiet is common to all axps , sgrs and to ( gotthelf 1998 ; for possible physical mechanisms see baring & harding 1998 ) .",
    "it is likely that they all share a common heritage and may prove to be part of an evolutionary sequence .",
