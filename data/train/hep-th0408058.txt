    "one of the most fundamental features of a physical system are the conserved quantities that are associated with the system .",

    "a logical extension of any conjectured relationship in an aads spacetime is of course its counterpart in the asymptotically de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes . the construction of the conserved charges using ads / cft counter  terms , however , depends on the spatial infinity present in any aads spacetime , a feature not shared by ads spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes also have no global timelike killing vector , as the norm of the killing vector changes sign as it crosses the horizon . inside the horizon ,",

    "the physical meaning of the conserved quantities is unclear ; for example , one could use the conformal killing vector to calculate the energy if one chose @xcite .    recently",
    "a method for computing conserved charges ( and associated boundary stress tensors ) of ads spacetimes from data at early or late time infinity was proposed @xcite , in analogy with brown - york prescription used in asymptotically ads spacetimes @xcite .",

    "we denote the boundary of @xmath16 by @xmath13 , and so the boundary of the spacetime @xmath15 consists of initial and final spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath18 at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively and a timelike hypersurface @xmath21 .",

    "in fact , the induced metric @xmath38 on @xmath13 is related to @xmath28 by @xmath39where @xmath40 is the lapse function and @xmath41is the shift vector .",
    "the gravitational stress - energy tensors in the boundaries could be obtained by variation of the action , under the variation of the boundary metrics .",
    "then by using the known relation for the variation of the boundary metric @xmath42 in terms of the variations of the lapse function , shift vector and induced metric @xmath38 , we obtain the following expressions for the energy surface density @xmath43 , momentum surface density @xmath44 and spatial stress @xmath45 , which are the normal and tangential projections of @xmath46 on the boundary @xmath13 : @xmath47 in the relations ( [ densities ] ) , @xmath46 is the energy - momentum tensor of the boundary @xmath22 ( the projection components of the @xmath46 from @xmath22 to @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath48 ) and @xmath49is the unit normal to the hypersurface @xmath13 .",
    "the origin of the additive terms @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 is from the addition of an extra term , a functional of the metric on the boundary to the action ( actiontot ) . such a term leaves the classical equations of motion invariant .",
    "variation of this extra term yields additional contributions to the energy and momentum surface densities and spatial stress .",
    "these quantities could be selected to obtain favorable finite results for the energy , momentum and stress in the background method or the finite boundary condition method @xcite . in the counterterm method ,",
    "these quantities are obtained by the variation of the counterterm lagrangian , which serves to eliminate divergences in the energy , angular momentum and boundary stress tensor .",
    "another equivalent representation of the above equations ( [ densities ] ) is available , in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface @xmath13 , the gravitational energy  momentum tensor of the hypersurface @xmath16 and the acceleration of the unit normal to this hypersurface @xcite .",
    "the total quasilocal energy is the integral of the energy surface density over the @xmath53boundary @xmath13 , @xmath54moreover , if we have a symmetry on the boundary @xmath22 , generated by a killing vector @xmath55 then the quantity@xmath56is conserved . in the absence of matter",
    ", the conserved @xmath57 could be written in terms of energy and momentum surface densities via @xmath58where conservation means that @xmath57 is independent of the particular boundary @xmath13 that is chosen for its actual calculation . as an example , consider a case where a timelike killing vector @xmath59 , with unit length , exists .",
    "moreover , we assume that this killing vector is surface forming .",
    "then it is the unit normal to a particular foliation of the boundary @xmath22 and on each slice of this foliation @xmath60 and @xmath61 in this case , the total energy of the slice ( [ en ] ) is just the negative of @xmath57 . for more general slices that are not orthogonal to the killing vector , the total energy is different from @xmath62 , which defines the conserved mass of the gravitational system .",
    "in @xmath8 dimensional spacetimes with positive cosmological constant , the equations of motion can be derived from the action @xmath63where @xmath64    the first term ( [ actbulk ] ) is the bulk action over the @xmath8 dimensional manifold @xmath65 with newtonian constant @xmath66 and the second term ( actbound ) is the gibbons - hawking surface term , necessary to ensure a well defined euler - lagrange variation .",
    "@xmath67 are spatial euclidean boundaries at early and late times and @xmath68 indicates an integral over the late time boundary minus an integral over the early time boundary .",
    "the quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the bulk spacetime metric , induced boundary metrics and the trace of extrinsic curvatures of the boundaries respectively",
    ". we shall usually suppress the `` @xmath71 '' notation when it is obvious .",
    "however , as is well known the action ( [ action ] ) is not finite when evaluated on a solution of the equations of motion .",
    "the reason is the infinite volume of the spacetime at early and late times .    the procedure , prior to the use of counter  terms , for dealing with such divergences in asymptotically flat / ads cases ( where they are large - distance effects ) was to include a reference action term @xcite , which corresponded to the action of embedding the boundary hypersurface @xmath72 ( whose unit normal is spacelike ) into some other manifold .",
    "the physical interpretation is that one has a collection of observers located on the closed manifold @xmath73 , and that the physical quantities they measure ( energy , angular momentum , etc . ) are those contained within this closed manifold relative to those of some reference spacetime ( regarded as the ground state ) in which @xmath72 is embedded @xcite .",
    "for example in an asymptotically anti de sitter spacetime , it would be natural to take pure ads as the ground state reference manifold .",
    "however this procedure suffers from several drawbacks : the reference spacetime in general can not be uniquely chosen @xcite nor can an arbitrary boundary @xmath72 always be embedded in a given reference spacetime .",
    "employing approximate embeddings can lead to ambiguity , confusion and incompleteness ; examples of this include the kerr martinez , taub - nut and taub - bolt spacetimes @xcite .",
    "extensions to asymptotically ds spacetimes are even more problematic , since the embedding surface will typically be time - dependent .",
    "an alternative approach for asymptotically ads spacetimes was suggested a few years ago that has enjoyed a greater measure of success balakraus , hensken , korea , sergey .",
    "it involves adding to the action terms that depend only on curvature invariants that are functionals of the intrinsic boundary geometry .",
    "such terms can not alter the equations of motion and , since they are divergent , offer the possibility of removing divergences that arise in the action ( [ action ] ) provided the coefficients of the allowed curvature invariants are correctly chosen .",
    "no embedding spacetime is required , and computations of the action and conserved charges yield unambiguous finite values that are intrinsic to the spacetime .",
    "this has been explicitly verified for the full range of type - d asymptotically ads spacetimes , including schwarzschild - ads , kerr - ads , taub - nut - ads , taub - bolt - ads , and taub - bolt - kerr - ads @xcite .",
    "the boundary counterterm action is universal , and a straightforward algorithm has been constructed for generating it @xcite .",
    "the procedure involves rewriting the einstein equations in gauss  codacci form , and then solving them in terms of the extrinsic curvature functional @xmath74 of the boundary @xmath75 and its normal derivatives to obtain the divergent parts .",
    "it succeeds because all divergent parts can be expressed in terms of intrinsic boundary data , and do not depend on normal derivatives @xcite . by writing the divergent part @xmath76 as a power series in the inverse cosmological constant",
    "the entire divergent structure can be covariantly isolated for any given boundary dimension @xmath37 ; by varying the boundary metric under a weyl transformation , it is straightforward to show that the trace @xmath77 is proportional to the divergent boundary counterterm lagrangian .",
    "explicit calculations have demonstrated that finite values for the action and conserved charges can be unambiguously computed up to @xmath78 for the class of kerr  ads metrics @xcite .",
    "the removal of divergences is completely analogous to that which takes place in quantum field theory by adding counterterms which are finite polynomials in the fields .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence conjecture asserts that these procedures are one and the same .",
    "corroborative evidence for this is given by calculations which illustrate that the trace anomalies and casimir energies obtained from the two different descriptions are in agreement for known cases hensken , korea , adscftcalcs .",
    "generalizations of the counterterm action to asymptotically flat spacetimes have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "they are quite robust , and allow for a full calculation of quasilocal conserved quantities in the kerr solution @xcite that go well beyond the slow - rotating limit that approximate embedding techniques require @xcite .",
    "although they can be inferred for general @xmath37 by considering spacetimes of special symmetry , they can not be algorithmically generated , and are in general dependent upon the boundary topology @xcite .",
    "turning next to the asymptotically de sitter case , we must add to the action ( [ action ] ) some counterterms to cancel its divergences @xmath79 so that @xmath80 is now the total action .",
    "for the special cases @xmath81 the counterterm lagrangian @xmath82was proposed , where @xmath83 is the intrinsic curvature of the boundary surfaces and the step function @xmath84 is equal to zero unless @xmath85 where it equals unity . the action ( [ count345 ] )",
    "was shown to cancel divergences in de sitter spacetime @xcite @xmath86and nariai spacetime @xmath87where the metric @xmath88 is a flat @xmath37-dimensional metric that covers an inflationary patch of de sitter spacetime and @xmath89 is the metric of a unit @xmath53-sphere . here",
    "@xmath90is the positive cosmological constant",
    ".    calculations of the total action are performed by cutting off de sitter space at a finite time , and then letting the surface approach future infinity .",
    "in odd dimensions , there is an additional divergence that is logarithmic in the conformal time ( that is @xmath91 ) and can not be cancelled without including an explicit cutoff dependence in the counterterm action , thereby leading to a conformal anomaly similar to what has been observed in the context of ads spacetimes confanom , confanom2 .",
    "furthermore , if we use the global covering coordinates of the ds spacetimes in which equal time hypersurfaces are @xmath37spheres ( instead of inflationary coordinates in which equal time hypersurfaces are flat ) , there is ( only for odd dimensional de sitter spacetimes ) a linear divergence in the action that can not be removed by adding local terms to the action that are polynomial in boundary curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "these divergences are the de sitter analogs of those found in the ads case for compact boundary geometries of the form of sphere or hyperbolic space with non - trivial topology @xcite . for reasons similar to the ads case",
    ", the linear divergence could be reflective of a uv divergence in the euclidean boundary cft and this need not be fatal to a putative ds / cft correspondence .    in higher dimensions , by writing the einstein equations in the gauss - coddacci form",
    "we can find the counterterm lagrangian for any given @xmath37 .",
    "the result is ,    @xmath92    for @xmath93 , where the step function @xmath84 vanishes unless @xmath94 .",
    "the associated boundary stress - energy tensor can be obtained by the variation of the action with respect to the boundary metric .    if the boundary geometry has an isometry generated by a killing vector @xmath95 , then it is straightforward to show that @xmath96 is divergenceless .",
    "we write the boundary metric in the form @xmath97where @xmath98 is a spacelike vector field that is the analytic continuation of a timelike vector field and the @xmath99 are coordinates describing closed surfaces @xmath16 .",
    "from this it is straightforward to show that the quantity @xmath100is conserved between surfaces of constant @xmath101 , whose unit normal is given by @xmath102 .",
    "physically this would mean that a collection of observers on the hypersurface whose metric is @xmath103 would all observe the same value of @xmath104 provided this surface had an isometry generated by @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath2 is itself a killing vector , then we can define @xmath106as the conserved mass associated with the surface @xmath16 at any given point @xmath101 on the boundary .",
    "this quantity changes with the cosmological time @xmath107 .",
    "however a collection of observers that defined a surface @xmath16 would find that the value of @xmath108 that they would measure would not change were they collectively relocated at a different value of @xmath101 on the spacelike surface @xmath72 . since all asymptotically de sitter spacetimes must have an asymptotic isometry generated by @xmath109 , there is at least the notion of a conserved total mass @xmath108 for the spacetime as computed at future / past infinity .",
    "similarly the quantity @xmath110can be regarded as a conserved angular momentum associated with the surface @xmath16 if the surface has an isometry generated by @xmath111 .",
    "now , by knowing the conserved mass and total action , we can evaluate the entropy of the gravitational system .",
    "we use the relation @xmath112extending the usual definition to asymptotically ds cases @xcite , which we justify below .",
    "it has been shown for @xmath113dimensional sds space that @xmath114 is a positive monotonically increasing function of @xmath108 , and that in @xmath115 dimensions @xmath114 is consistent with the cardy formula @xcite , providing suggestive evidence in favour of the second law in this context .",
    "in this section we consider extending the path  integral formulation of ( semi - classical ) quantum gravity to the case of asymptotically ds spacetimes .",
    "we will see that this approach provides a justification for the relation ( [ entr ] ) , despite the rather unconventional notion of total mass energy given in eq .",
    "( [ mcons ] ) .",

    "\\label{sgenc}\\]]the periodicity condition for ensuring regularity ( [ betagenc ] ) and removal of all misner strings now yields @xmath566however , unlike in the r  approach , we now have two distinct classes of solutions to ( [ consistencygenc2 ] ) , depending on the co  dimensionality of the fixed point set of @xmath416 .",
    "the fixed point set of @xmath567 can be @xmath53 dimensional or it can be of @xmath568dimensionality .",
    "the @xmath53 dimensional case yields a solution @xmath569 and is called a bolt solution  we thus refer to this case as the taub",
    "c solution ; and the @xmath568dimensional case yields a solution @xmath570 and is called a nut solution  we refer to this as the taub  nut  c solution .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that this solution can be analytically continued to a taub  nut  r solution .",
    "the entropy defined by the gibbs  duhem relation ( [ gdoutfinal ] ) would appear to have the requisite properties : it is positive and monotonically increasing with conserved mass for the schwarzschild  de sitter case , and obeys the first law of thermodynamics for all cases we have considered so far ( indeed , since our definition is built on the path integral formalism , it is hard to see how it could be otherwise ) .",
    "however the applicability of the second law remains an outstanding problem : in what sense can we say that the entropy always increases in any physical process in this context ?",
    "even more intriguing is the relationship between this entropy and the underlying degrees of freedom that it presumably counts .",
    "looking at the previous results from a wider perspective , it is clear that it is possible to extend the concepts of conserved quantities , actions , entropies and path  integral methods outside of cosmological horizons .",
    "we have extended the use of the path  integral formalism to include quantum correlations between timelike histories . by employing this formalism in the semiclassical approximation",
    "we have been able to extend our notions of conserved quantities ( such as mass and angular momentum ) , actions and entropies outside of cosmological horizons . applying this formalism to schwarzschild ",
    "de sitter spacetimes we find that the values of these quantities are in accord with our physical expectations @xcite .",
    "however when we extend this formalism to nut ",
    "charged spacetimes we find that the situation is considerably modified .",
    "first , nut  charged spacetimes present us with two possible ways ( the r  approach and the c  approach ) in which we can apply our formalism , depending on how the spacetime is analytically continued .",
    "we could , of course , have simply used one or the other of these methods , as it has been recently shown @xcite that the two approaches are equivalent and interchangeable through analytic continuation .",
    "however , we felt that it was more demonstrative to show both methods , for those more familiar with the c  approach from ads analysis .",
    "we have also found that there exist broad ranges of parameter space for which nut  charged spacetimes violate both the maximal mass conjecture and the @xmath0bound , in both four dimensions and in higher dimensions .",
    "we find the thermodynamic behaviour for the @xmath9dimensional spacetimes to be qualitatively similar , with the lower branch entropy always negative , and the upper branch solutions always having a range of @xmath137 in which both the entropy and the specific heat are positive . likewise",
    "the @xmath571dimensional spacetimes have qualitatively similar thermodynamics , behaving as illustrated in figures ( [ mass6pos ] ) and ( [ ent6pos ] ) .",
    "the entropy ",
    "area relation @xmath572 is satisfied for any black hole in a @xmath127 dimensional af , where @xmath193 is the area of a @xmath573 dimensional fixed point set of isometry group .",
    "however , this relationship does not hold for other kinds of spacetimes in which the isometry group has fixed points on surfaces of even co - dimension @xcite .",
    "the best examples of these spacetimes are asymptotically locally flat and asymptotically locally ads spacetimes with nut charge . in these cases when the isometry group has a two  dimensional fixed set ( bolt ) , the entropy of the spacetime is not given by the area ",
    "entropy relation , as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics @xcite .    in",
    "asymptotically ds spacetimes , the gibbs",
    " duhem entropy ( [ gdoutfinal ] ) is proportional to the area of the horizon and respects the @xmath0bound ( this has also been shown for the schwarzschild ",
    "ds spacetime gm ) .",
    "however , for asymptotically locally ds spacetimes with nut charge , the entropy is no longer proportional to the area . consequently the entropy need not respect the @xmath0bound , and we find that there are a wide range of situations where it does not",
    ".    it would be interesting to understand the range of applicability of the @xmath0bound is asymptotically ds spacetimes .",
    "does it hold only for spacetimes in which entropy is proportional to area ? if not , what are the minimal requirements for the @xmath0bound to hold ?",
    "can one make sense of a theory of quantum gravity in which the @xmath0bound does not hold ?",
    "these questions remain interesting avenues for further study .",
    "we summarize here some developments that have taken place since the work described in this paper was completed.one comment that has been raised regarding the counterexamples we present has to do with the presence of closed timelike curves ( ctc s ) .",
    "the chronological protection conjecture @xcite ( cpc ) suggests that spacetimes with ctc s develop singularities upon perturbation of the stress tensor , and it has been claimed @xcite that the counter - examples we present are not true counter - examples but are at best marginal . following up on this , anderson @xcite obtained an counterexample to the maximal mass conjecture using nut - charged spacetimes that do not have ctc s and whose overall global structure is the same as that of pure de sitter space .",
    "this example can be found from our four - dimensional taub - nut - ds metric ( 9.1 ) by analytic continuation ; the parameters of the metric as such that it excludes horizons and so also excludes ctc s .",
    "we comment that our calculation of the conserved  @xmath127-dimensional mass from eq .",
    "( 3.13 ) does not depend upon the existence of horizons ( or ctcs ) .",
    "since the mass and nut charge are a - priori independent , it is straightforward to choose values of these quantities ( in units of , say , the cosmological constant ) that preserve the global structure of pure de sitter space and violate the maximal mass conjecture .",
    "for example , one can choose the values employed by anderson @xcite , recovering the counterexample he presents .",
    "we also note that the applicability of the cpc here requires some care ; for example the maximal extension of kerr - ds spacetimes contains ctcs , yet their exclusion from some form of the maximal mass conjecture would seem unduly restrictive .",
    "of course a proof of the maximal mass conjecture under reasonable physical restrictions remains an interesting area of research .    shortly after the completion of this review paper",
    ", we were made aware of several papers of interest .",
    "cai and ohta @xcite have discussed an adaptation of the counterterm method for non - anti de sitter spacetimes , and cai , myung and ohta @xcite discuss the n - bound relative to black holes .",
    "we also note that nojiri and odintsov @xcite constructed surface terms from the de sitter bulk and obtained the 4 dimensional conformal anomaly ; they also extended this asymptotically ds bulk spacetimes and discussed the relationship with holographic rg flow nojodint2 .",
