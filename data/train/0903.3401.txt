    "it studies the properties of a scalar function @xmath8 ( defined on a topological space @xmath9 ) which are invariant with respect to perturbations .",
    "these functions are central in many applications such as shape matching . in other words ,",
    "topological persistence measures the persistence of topological structures ( e.g. connected components ) within the sublevel sets , @xmath10 , of a scalar field .",
    "+ a key tool in topological persistence is the concept of natural pseudodistance ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on a quantitative comparison between suitable topological spaces , endowed with real - valued functions .",
    "we work with pairs @xmath11 and @xmath5 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are compact connected and locally connected hausdorff spaces which represent the shapes to be compared and @xmath2 , @xmath3 are continuous functions which focus the shape properties we are interested in .",
    "so , our aim is to measurethe difference between the pairs @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the concept of natural pseudodistance is based on the search for a homeomorphism @xmath12 minimizing the change from the function @xmath8 to the function @xmath13 , that is @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the set of all homeomorphisms between the topological spaces",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in case where the topological spaces are manifolds , the study of this concept has pointed out some interesting properties and shown that these properties could depend on the dimension of the manifolds we are considering ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this approach is also interesting for application purposes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and is strictly related to persistent homology , another field of research that concerns the comparison of manifolds endowed with real - valued functions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another fundamental tool in topological persistence is the size function associated to a pair @xmath4 .",
    "size functions not only give us a lower bound for the natural pseudodistance , but they are also useful in many applications for pattern recognition ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    ".4 cm    while the definition of natural pseudodistance is based on the @xmath16 norm , in @xcite it has been recently pointed out that this norm can be replaced by many other ( semi)norms , @xmath17 , so producing different pseudodistances    @xmath18 the only requirement is that these seminorms , @xmath17 , must be reparametrization invariant , i.e. invariant under composition with homeomorphisms of the considered topological spaces .",
    "the new pseudodistances we obtain when we change the seminorm will be called exotic pseudodistancesto differ from the pseudodistance in the naturalcase .",
    "this change of the seminorm is useful in certain cases where the natural pseudodistance does not take into account some details .",
    "for example , let us consider @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 . while the value taken by the exotic pseudodistance between the pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 is @xmath23 and the one between @xmath24 and @xmath22 is @xmath25 , the natural pseudodistance between the same pairs is @xmath25 , in both cases .",
    "following the approach exposed in @xcite , after the @xmath16 norm , the simplest example of reparametrization invariant seminorm is the seminorm @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to give a formal introduction of the pseudodistances associated with reparametrization invariant seminorms and to begin the study of the pseudodistance @xmath27 associated with the seminorm @xmath26 .",
    "our main result is a sharp lower bound for @xmath27 , obtained by using a previous lower bound for the natural pseudodistance .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the theoretical background , while in section 3 the definition of exotic pseudodistance is introduced . in section 4",
    "our lower bound for @xmath27 is proved .",
    "we finish with an example ( section 5 ) where all these notions are illustrated .",
    "in this section we will review the basic notions we shall require for the sections to follow . for more details about them we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider pairs of the form @xmath4 where @xmath0 is a non - empty compact connected and locally connected hausdorff space and @xmath28 is a continuous function called a _ measuring function_. the collection of these pairs will be denoted by @xmath29 and each element @xmath4 of @xmath29 will be called a @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the set of real valued continuous functions on @xmath0 and @xmath32 be the ( possibly empty ) set of all homeomorphisms between the topological spaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the set of real numbers greater than or equal to zero .",
    "all the following definitions can easily be extended to cases where the topological spaces underlying the size pairs are not connected .",
    "for every compact topological space @xmath0 we consider the functional @xmath34 defined by setting @xmath35    let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be two size pairs with @xmath36 .",
    "the number @xmath37 measures how much @xmath38 changes the values taken by the measuring function .",
    "we define the _ natural pseudodistance _ between @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xmath39    we can verify immediately that @xmath40 is a pseudodistance in each equivalence class of @xmath41 where we say that two size pairs are equivalent with respect to the relation @xmath42 if and only if the underlying topological spaces are homeomorphic .",
    "note that @xmath40 is not a distance , since two different size pairs can have vanishing distance .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 is an extended pseudodistance in _ size _ , where the adjective extended means that @xmath40 can take the value @xmath43 .",
    ".5 cm    before giving the notion of size function , we fix some notation .",
    "the symbol @xmath44 denotes the diagonal of @xmath45 , that is @xmath46 and @xmath47 denotes the open half - plane above @xmath44 , that is @xmath48    for each size pair @xmath4 and @xmath49 , we say that two points @xmath50 are @xmath51-_connected _ if and only if they belong to the same connected component of the lower level set @xmath52",
    ". then we define @xmath53 for @xmath54 as the number of equivalence classes into which the lower level set @xmath55 is divided by the equivalence relation of @xmath51-connectedness .",
    "we call    @xmath56 the _ size function associated with the size pair @xmath4_.      in order to define the matching distance , we begin by describing how each size function can be represented as a set of points and lines in the real plane , with multiplicities .",
    "we start with the definition of particular points of @xmath57 , the cornerpoints associated with a size function ( cf .",

    ".2 cm    for every point @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 we define the number @xmath62 as @xmath63 the finite number @xmath64 will be called the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we call _ cornerpoint _ for @xmath66 any point @xmath58 such that the number @xmath67 is strictly positive .    for every vertical line @xmath68 , with equation @xmath69 , and @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath70",
    "we define the number @xmath71 as @xmath72 the finite number @xmath73 will be called the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath68 for @xmath66 .",
    "when this multiplicity is strictly positive we call @xmath68 a _ cornerpoint at infinity _ for the size function , and we identify @xmath68 with the pair @xmath74 .    we denote by @xmath75 the open half - plane @xmath76 extended by the points at infinity of the kind @xmath74 , with @xmath77 , and by @xmath78 the closed half - plane @xmath79 extended by the same points at infinity .    cornerpoints and",
    "their multiplicities are fundamental tools in size theory , since size functions are completely determined by their cornerpoints and multiplicities .",
    "indeed , we have the following representation theorem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for every @xmath80 we have",
    "@xmath81    we recall some definitions .",
    "let @xmath82 be a size function .",

    "now , we define a pseudometric in @xmath85 that will give rise to a distance between size functions .",
    "we define the function @xmath90 by    @xmath91    where conventions regarding @xmath43 are : @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
