    "we adopt @xmath26 as the unit of energy .",
    "the terms @xmath27 correspond , respectively , to superexchange and coulomb interaction between nearest neighbors .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath5-@xmath3-@xmath6 model ( [ eehh ] ) has been considered by a number of authors , including a hartree - fock treatment of the infinite system with only nearest - neighbor hopping@xcite and rg studies of both the half - filled case@xcite with @xmath28 and the model with small @xmath29 near the van hove fillings.@xcite    finally , the ring - exchange term in eq .",

    "the phase diagram of a 2d system in the presence of this term has been considered only for the heisenberg antiferromagnet,@xcite although further progress has been possible for 1d magnetic systems.@xcite      the hfa is the simplest and the most efficient approach for the study of interacting electron systems .",
    "although its application may seem inherently limited to the regime of weak interactions , it provides satisfactory results at all interaction strengths when the correlation energy is small ( for example in magnetically polarized phases ) , and thus can be used to obtain meaningful qualitative insight into the nature of possible ordered phases also for large @xmath5 . in the hfa , multiparticle interaction terms are decoupled into all possible operator pairs , all but one of which are replaced by @xmath33-number expectation values to leave a single - particle hamiltonian . in the present analysis the choice of operator pairs with finite expectation values is as follows .",
    "because our primary interest is the study of flux phases , we will work with a repulsive intersite coulomb interaction @xmath8 , in which case no pairing decouplings need be considered , @xmath34 . in the absence of single - site spin - flip terms in the hamiltonian [ eq .

    "( [ edj]-[edk ] ) we have omitted the constant terms bilinear in the expectation values [ analogous to the final term in each line of eq .",
    "( [ edu ] ) ] .",
    "we have performed calculations on a finite cluster in real space to establish the microscopic conditions under which the cf and sf phases are manifest as circulating currents of real electrons ( or holes ) , which arise from a mismatch in hopping expectation values between the two directions along each bond in a coherent pattern .",
    "these bond expectation values , the site charges , and the site magnetic moments are computed for any set of interaction parameters and iterated to self - consistency .",
    "the hfa in real space has been used extensively for qualitative modeling of cuprate systems , and in particular for the analysis of charge - inhomogeneous stripe and other density - wave phases , which it tends to favor .",
    "a full review of the technique is presented in ref .  , and we summarize here those aspects of its application which are important for the current analysis .",
    "most importantly , the hfa suppresses fluctuation terms and thus favors ( homogeneous or inhomogeneous ) ordered states which minimize static interactions .",
    "magnetic and charge - density interactions , which are zeroth - order in particle - hopping fluctuations , are enhanced relative to kinetic terms , and it is for this reason that the method tends to find ground states with inhomogeneous charge distributions and/or magnetic order .",
    "by contrast , methods such as the hubbard @xmath4-operator and other large-@xmath1 approaches have a tendency to favor kinetic terms , as a result of which they do not show stripe phases and often produce flux - phase ground states .",
    "thus a real - space hartree - fock analysis is not an appropriate framework for an unbiased discussion of energetic contributions and true ground states ; in specific terms , the flux phases we investigate are frequently local rather than global energy minima .",
    "mindful of this fact , we will restrict our considerations to qualitative statements concerning the nature of circulating - current phases and the relative effect upon them both of doping and of the different interactions , particularly the ring - exchange term .",
    "we note also that the method is especially sensitive to the choice of starting state , as well as to boundary conditions and in some cases to commensurability effects due to the electron filling .",
    "a careful specification of these extrinsic variables is required in order to make meaningful comparisons yielding intrinsic electronic properties.@xcite we will consider a system of size @xmath1 = 12@xmath5512 sites with periodic boundary conditions ; qualitatively similar results were obtained with systems of size 8@xmath558 and 16@xmath5516 , and we have established that flux states may be found for any rectangular system with even - length sides .",
    "open boundary conditions lead to a suppression of circulating currents and to inhomogeneous edge values , and are not considered further .",
    "the establishment of global , as opposed to local , energy minima may be pursued as in ref .  , but for comparative studies of flux states is not of prime importance ( preceding paragraph ) .",
    "finally , by considering the evolution of the results with electron filling we will demonstrate that commensuration effects are absent and thus that the system size is sufficient for robust qualitative conclusions .",
    "we begin by establishing homogeneous flux phases in the generalized hubbard model on a cluster . as expected from the weak - coupling results mentioned in sec .",
    "i,@xcite we find that the nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath3 and @xmath6 are of crucial importance : circulating - current states appear close to half - filling only for simultaneously large values ( @xmath56 ) of the interaction ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the cf phase , with finite currents of up- and down - spin electrons moving in the same direction [ fig .",

    "we characterize the dependence of the homogeneous cf and sf phases on the doping and on the magnitude of the interactions .     and current @xmath59 per bond for each spin orientation as obtained in hfa for cf ( @xmath9 ) and sf ( @xmath10 ) phases with @xmath60.,height=264 ]",

    "the real part @xmath65 is a component of the bond kinetic energy , and constitutes one eighth of the hopping kinetic energy per site of the system , while the imaginary part @xmath66 corresponds to one half of the bond current for a single spin species ( and thus to one quarter of the charge current in a cf phase ) .",
    "it is clear that , for moderate interaction strengths , circulating - current states are robust close to half - filling .",

    "qualitatively , one of the principal effects of projection is to sharpen the competition between the different candidate ground states .",
    "the exclusion of doubly occupied states eliminates most of the possibilities for a coexistence of localized and delocalized phases , and phase boundaries would thus be expected to become better defined . for cf phases these boundaries may also move closer to a parameter regime meaningful for cuprates ( see below ) : when viewed as a means for dynamical holes to avoid each other ( by circulating around each other on plaquettes ) , the cf state indeed allows a greater spatial separation than the superconducting state while retaining a favorable kinetic energy .",
    "however , application of this schematic picture for the sf phase , which requires in principle that up- and down - spin particles can move past each other on each individual plaquette , suggests that this type of state would be completely suppressed by projection .    by inspection of the gutzwiller prefactors ( [ egf ] ) it is clear that close to half - filling the properties of the projected model are significantly different from those of the unprojected model . with full projection the factor @xmath99 vanishes as @xmath120 , giving a complete suppression of the kinetic contributions to the total energy , and also of any bond currents .",
    "this suppression is large for small doping , where the kinetic and current terms are significantly smaller than in the unprojected system .",

    "we stress that in the projected model the kinetic terms are no longer identical to the real and imaginary parts of the bond - order parameter @xmath139 , but are related by a ratio of gutzwiller factors ( [ egf ] ) .",
