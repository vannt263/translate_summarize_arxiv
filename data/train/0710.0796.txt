    "faint , low mass galaxies are the most numerous galaxy type in the universe , and are thus fundamental in understanding galaxy formation",
    ". however , their low luminosities and low surface brightness make detailed studies of them difficult .",
    "because dwarfs are so common , any galaxy evolution / formation theory must clearly be able to predict and describe the properties of these galaxies .",
    "the luminosity functions of nearby galaxies in all environments reveal that dwarf galaxies are far more common than brighter galaxies . within galaxy clusters there furthermore appears to be an overdensity of dwarf galaxies when compared to the field . the origin of these extra dwarfs , or if this excess is even real , remains unknown .",
    "the cluster luminosity function itself is not universal , but is strongly dependent on environment @xcite , with the luminosity function often steeper in the more diffuse outer regions of clusters than in the denser cluster cores .",
    "the luminosity function also depends on the individual cluster , with each one having a characteristic luminosity function .",
    "for example , the fornax cluster is compact and rich in early - type galaxies , with a flat luminosity function faint - end slope of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the virgo cluster has a high abundance of spiral galaxies and has a steeper luminosity function with a faint end slope of @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we know that both local group ( lg ) dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies display varying star formation histories , with metal poor populations as old as the classical halo globular galaxies , but with evidence for star formation as little as 2 - 3 gyr ago .",
    "some low - mass lg galaxies such as sagittarius , contain surprisingly high metal rich stellar populations considering their luminosities , as is also seen in clusters of galaxies .",
    "previous spectroscopic and ground based imaging has revealed that dwarfs in the core of clusters are not a simple homogeneous population , with cluster core galaxies fainter than m@xmath0 @xmath14 containing a mix of metallicities and ages ( @xcite ) .",
    "the formation scenarios for dwarf galaxies fall into two categories .",
    "the first of these is that dwarfs are old , primordial objects ( hierarchical model ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second is that they have recently evolved or transformed from a progenitor galaxy population ( e.g. @xcite ) . within hierarchical models of galaxy formation",
    ", dwarf galaxies are formed from small density fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "the lowest mass systems ( i.e. dwarf galaxies ) form first , and massive galaxies are built from these in mergers . if star formation occurred soon after the gravitational collapse of initial density perturbations , dwarf galaxy halos would be amongst the first objects to form ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "theory also predicts that such systems would form first in the densest environments , although cluster des would not necessarily contain the first stars formed in the universe .",
    "these halos could have formed their stars quite recently ,",
    "if star formation was suppressed in some way @xcite .    dwarfs in clusters , on the other hand , could also be the remnants of stripped discs or dwarf irregulars . through galaxy harassment and interactions ,",
    "these progenitors become morphologically transformed into des .",
    "cluster galaxies become stripped of their interstellar medium , and become dynamically heated by high - speed interactions with other galaxies and the gravitational potential of the cluster . to compensate",
    ", the galaxy loses stars , and over time the spiral can morphologically transform into a de @xcite .",
    "this model is supported by recent observations of embedded discs in des in the virgo and fornax clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "distant clusters at z @xmath15 0.4 are also filled with small spiral galaxies , but this population is largely absent in nearby clusters , where dwarf spheroidals make up the faint - end of the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "downsizing @xcite is the observed trend that star formation occurs later , and over more extended timescales , in smaller galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "des and lower mass galaxies formed or entered clusters after the giant galaxies .",
    "low mass galaxies on average end their star formation after the giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "for example , the faint end of the red sequence in clusters is not formed until z @xmath9 0.8 @xcite , implying the luminosity weighted stellar populations of lower mass galaxies are younger than the stars in the giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "this seems to contradict the hierarchical method of galaxy formation , where dwarf systems form first .",
    "also , dwarf elliptical galaxies are preferentially found in dense cluster environments , with few examples of isolated des , again contradicting the hierarchical model of galaxy formation .",
    "however , some des in clusters contain old stellar populations , so it is likely that multiple formation methods are needed to explain the origin of cluster dwarfs .    the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) for cluster galaxies",
    "is well defined at bright magnitudes and forms a tight sequence .",
    "however , it is unclear what the shape of the red sequence is at fainter magnitudes @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that galaxies at the brightest 4 magnitudes of perseus obey the cmr , with the fainter candidate members showing significant scatter from the relation .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and others find no deviation from the cmr at fainter magnitudes in other clusters .",
    "instead , the faint red sequence is an extrapolation of what is observed at brighter magnitudes .",
    "with spectroscopy , we can test this directly by finding confirmed dwarf members of the cluster to establish the true form of the colour magnitude relation .",
    "spectroscopy can also be used to measure the faint - end of the luminosity function in galaxy clusters , which is fundamental in describing the galaxy population .",
    "the luminosity function contains important information on the formation and evolution of galaxies , and at low redshifts contains the combined influence of the galaxy initial mass function , and the effects of any evolutionary processes that have taken place in the cluster since its formation .    in this paper",
    ", we use deep keck spectroscopy to determine cluster membership for dwarfs at m@xmath0 @xmath9 @xmath16 , and present the ages and metallicities of these galaxies based on the strengths of balmer and metal absorption lines in their spectra .",
    "we confirm that twelve dwarfs are perseus cluster members , while the remaining objects are background galaxies .",
    "using these results , we examine the colour - magnitude relation for the perseus cluster down to m@xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "we also measure the luminosity function faint - end slope @xmath4 based on our cluster membership results .",
    "our main conclusion is that some dwarf galaxies in perseus have old , metal poor populations , whilst others are younger , metal rich systems .",
    "this suggests that dwarf galaxies in the core of the perseus cluster are not a simple , homogeneous population , but require multiple scenarios for their formation .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in @xmath17 2 we discuss the observations and the selection criteria for the dwarf galaxies , @xmath17 3.1 identifies the cluster members , @xmath17 3.2 presents the colour magnitude relation , and the central luminosity function is presented in @xmath17 3.3 . in @xmath17 3.4",
    "we derive luminosity weighted ages and metallicities for the newly confirmed cluster members .",
    "a discussion of the main results is presented in @xmath17 4 and these results are summarised in @xmath17 5 .",
    "we assume the distance to the perseus cluster is 77 mpc throughout this paper .",
    "the perseus cluster ( abell 426 ) is one of the richest nearby galaxy clusters , with a redshift @xmath18 = 5366 km s@xmath19 @xcite , and at a distance d = 77 mpc .",
    "it also has a high velocity dispersion of @xmath20 = 1324 km s@xmath19 @xcite . despite its proximity",
    "it has not been studied in as much detail as clusters such as virgo and fornax , most likely due to its low galactic latitude ( _ b _ = @xmath21 ) .",
    "candidate dwarf elliptical galaxies in perseus for our keck spectroscopic observations were selected from those listed in @xcite , and we follow the same numbering system throughout this paper . all dwarfs in this list have colours ( b@xmath22r)@xmath23 @xmath9 2 , and are symmetric , round or elliptical in shape , without evidence for star formation .",
    "all the candidates also have a central surface brightness fainter than @xmath24 = 24.0 mag arcsec@xmath25 , and have near - exponential surface brightness profiles .",
    "we restrict our study to those dwarf galaxies with m@xmath0 @xmath9 @xmath26 to be more certain of cluster membership . for more detail of the selection process ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also observed an additional two objects not in this original list , one of which is a dwarf galaxy , and the other an irregular galaxy ( selected to fill the slits on one of the masks during spectroscopy ) .",
    "we also carried out photometry on these additional objects so they could be included on the colour - magnitude diagram presented in @xmath17 3.2 .",
    "all candidates lie within the central 173 arcmin@xmath27 of the cluster , and have m@xmath0 @xmath28 to m@xmath0 @xmath1 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     line - strength indices as determined by the definitions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the combined iron index is defined as @xmath9fe@xmath11 = @xmath29(fe5270+fe5335 ) and the @xmath30$]-insensitive index [ mgfe] is defined as [ mgfe] = @xmath31b@xmath32^{0.5}$ ] @xcite .",
    "not every index was measured for every galaxy .",
    "dwarf ellipticals without star formation that are blue in colour are expected to be metal poor , whereas those with redder colours are expected to be metal rich .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to derive ages and metallicities for the two redder dwarfs ( galaxies cgw 31 and cgw 49 ) , as not all the spectral features could be measured reliably .",
    "one galaxy , 54 ( table 1 ) , is younger and more metal rich than the other dwarfs for which we obtained a good set of indices .",
    "it has an age @xmath9 5 gyr , and a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath11 -0.33 .",
    "the ( b@xmath22r)@xmath23 colour of this particular galaxy is 1.22 , and it lies on the fit between colour and magnitude for the cluster ellipticals and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the other galaxies for which ages and metallicities are determined are cgw 16 , and cgw 20 .",
    "these galaxies are metal poor and have ( b@xmath22r)@xmath23 colours of 1.18 , 1.19 and 1.16 respectively",
    ". these galaxies again lie close to the colour - magnitude relation for the cluster ellipticals and dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore it appears that both young and old dwarf galaxies in perseus lie on the same colour - magnitude relation .",
    "this is confirmed with ages obtained using the h@xmath33 index , when again both young and old dwarf galaxies in perseus lie on the same colour - magnitude relation .",
    "we find no correlation between either metallicity or age , determined using the h@xmath34 index , with ( b@xmath22r)@xmath23 colour as shown in figures 8@xmath35 and 8@xmath36 .",
    "however , we do find a clear anti - correlation between age and metallicity ( fig .",
    "8@xmath37 ) .",
    "the older the dwarf elliptical , the more metal poor it is .",
    "this has been found in previous studies such as that of @xcite , who find an anti - correlation between age and metallicity for galaxies in the coma cluster in any luminosity bin .",
    "band image of the irregular galaxy at @xmath4 = 03 19 05.1 , @xmath38 = @xmath3941 28 12.4 .",
    "the solid black line in this figure is 10  in length.,width=317 ]    we also obtained a spectrum of an irregular galaxy at @xmath4 = 03 19 05.1 and @xmath38 = @xmath3941 28 12.4 . from the absorption lines ,",
    "this galaxy was found to be at a radial velocity of 4032 @xmath6 39 km s@xmath19 , confirming it as a member of the perseus cluster .",
    "a second object was present in the slit for this galaxy , which had balmer lines in emission in its spectrum .",
    "based on the positions of these emission lines , the additional object was found to be at @xmath40 @xmath15 0.055 , giving the object a radial velocity of @xmath15 16500 km s@xmath19 .",
    "this would make it either a background galaxy , or an interacting galaxy with a velocity difference of @xmath15 12450 km s@xmath19 from the main galaxy .    from the image of this galaxy ,",
    "a tidal tail is clearly visible to the left hand side of the galaxy as seen in figure 9 .",
    "this irregular galaxy is therefore most likely a merged system .",
    "assuming the perseus cluster is at a distance of 77 mpc , this tidal tail has a length of @xmath15 7.5 kpc .",
    "we find that the radial velocity dispersion for dwarf galaxies , @xmath41 1818 km s@xmath19 , is higher than the value of 1324 km s@xmath19 found by @xcite for the giant galaxies in perseus .",
    "these results agree with results found by @xcite for dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "an infall origin for dwarfs can explain this difference in velocity dispersion between the brighter cluster galaxies and the dwarfs .",
    "infalling spirals can become morphologically transformed into dwarf ellipticals by high speed interactions with other cluster galaxies , and by the gravitational potential of the cluster itself ( harassment ) .",
    "another possibility is that infalling dark matter halos enter the cluster at later times , with the gas in the halos being converted into stars due to tidal forces during the cluster assembly .",
    "the velocity characteristics of low - mass , infalling galaxies should change little over several gigayears , thus the velocity dispersion would represent the mass profile of the cluster at the time of accretion .",
    "we also find in perseus an increase in the scatter of the colour - magnitude relation for magnitudes fainter that m@xmath0 @xmath2 , which can be interpreted as a diversity in the ages and metallicities of the low mass systems .",
    "a range in the ages and metallicities of low - mass systems suggests that dwarf galaxies are not a homogeneous population , as redder , more metal rich cluster dwarfs must have been formed more recently than the blue population .",
    "@xcite suggest that a large fraction of faint red galaxies in current clusters moved onto the colour - magnitude relation relatively recently , with their star formation activity coming to an end at around z @xmath15 0.8 .",
    "clusters at redshift z @xmath15 1 have a deficit of red - sequence galaxies , with the dwarf cluster population becoming progressively fewer in number as we move out to increasing redshifts .",
    "the rate of infalling spiral galaxies is expected to peak at @xmath40 @xmath15 0.8 in a cdm cosmology with @xmath42 = 1 and @xmath43 = 50 km s@xmath19 @xcite , the same redshift at which @xcite suggest a large fraction of faint red galaxies in current clusters moved onto the colour - magnitude relation .",
    "if des are indeed formed from infalling spirals , it seems likely that they originate from this epoch .",
    "we find that the faint - end luminosity function is less steep than what was found in previous studies of the perseus cluster , and in fact matches the value of @xmath4 @xmath5 found by @xcite for the field .",
    "we remove all galaxies incorrectly classified as dwarfs by @xcite from the luminosity function , to refit this faint end slope .",
    "the shape of the luminosity function at faint magnitudes is dependent on many processes , one of which is the efficiency at which gas is converted into stars ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "gas loss from supernova driven winds would reduce the star formation efficiency .",
    "star formation and/or nuclear activity in dwarf galaxies could also photoionize the intergalactic medium , regulating the galaxy formation process @xcite .",
    "another effect on the faint - end slope is that dark halos in denser , evolved clusters are more efficient at collecting gas used to form stars than those in unevolved clusters @xcite .",
    "yet another process changing the shape of the faint end slop is dynamical stripping of higher mass galaxies that would increase the number of low - mass systems in a cluster @xcite .",
    "also , dwarfs in the inner regions of dense clusters are less able to survive due to harassment @xcite , causing the faint - end slope to flatten for such environments .    whilst our value of @xmath4 @xmath5",
    "@xmath6 0.06 for dwarfs in the perseus cluster core is comparable with that of the field , it is also similar to the value of @xmath44 @xcite in the core region of abell 2218 . in abell 2218 , the slope of the luminosity function varies with cluster environment , going from @xmath4 @xmath45 @xmath6 0.13 in the central core of the cluster to @xmath4 @xmath46 @xmath6 0.06 outside of the core .",
    "@xcite infer that the core of abell 2218 is  dwarf depleted \" , with the dwarf - to - giant ratio decreasing monotonically with increasing cluster density .",
    "galaxy clusters with less prominent dwarf populations are in fact those with the highest projected galaxy densities @xcite .    the reason for this depletion in the core regions of clusters can perhaps be explained by galaxy harassment .",
    "tidal effects become more important in the centre of clusters , with smaller spheroidal galaxies being easily destroyed @xcite .",
    "the lowest surface brightness objects will disintegrate in the inner regions , decreasing the dwarf - to - giant ratio , whilst in outer regions such galaxies would be able to survive .",
    "more recently , @xcite find no evidence for a faint - end upturn in the luminosity function in clusters at @xmath40 = 0.3 .",
    "there will be less contamination from background galaxies in clusters at these redshifts , and therefore such galaxies would not artificially steepen the faint - end slope to the degree seen in local clusters .",
    "@xcite argue that the faint - end upturn in the lf in nearby clusters is of recent origin , although our results could contradict this theory as we find no evidence for a faint - end slope upturn .",
    "a hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that within a given environment , low - mass galaxies would be the first to form .",
    "however , it appears that many low mass galaxies finish forming after the giants , through  downsizing \" .",
    "for example , results from @xcite suggest that a large fraction of dwarf galaxies in current clusters moved onto the red sequence relatively recently , with a cessation in star formation activity at _ z _ @xmath47 0.8 .",
    "this is also seen for field galaxies @xcite , suggesting downsizing is a possible origin for dwarf galaxies in both environments .",
    "we find both old , metal - poor dwarfs and young , metal rich dwarfs in perseus .",
    "this is consistent with results by @xcite for faint galaxies in coma , where dwarf galaxies occupy a large region on the ssp model grid , covering a range of metallicity and ages , with most lying in the region [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath48 and ages @xmath9 1 gyr .",
    "these results imply that downsizing is a real effect , with the younger dwarfs ending star formation at some time after the giant cluster members . whilst some dwarfs are indeed primordial , not all cluster dwarfs are old",
    ". the formation of these young dwarfs may involve the removal of mass from infalling higher - mass spirals ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have analysed keck / lris spectra for twenty - three dwarf galaxy candidates in the perseus cluster , from which we have confirmed cluster membership for twelve systems based on radial velocities measured from absorption lines .",
    "we extend the confirmed member colour - magnitude relation for perseus down to m@xmath0 @xmath1 , finding that the slope of the colour - magnitude relation becomes bluer when the low - surface brightness dwarf galaxies are included .",
    "the fainter dwarfs also scatter more from the colour - magnitude relation , following the trend observed by @xcite for low - mass galaxies in fornax and coma .",
    "this scatter can be interpreted as a spread in the metallicity distributions of dwarf galaxies , which has been inferred for dwarf galaxies in other clusters by @xcite and @xcite .    after removing non - members from the @xmath49-band luminosity function for the perseus cluster",
    "we find a faint - end slope @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 0.06 , similar to the field .",
    "previous studies of other galaxy clusters have found that the dwarf - to - giant ratio is a function of local projected galaxy density .",
    "extending this study to the outer regions of perseus would enable us to see how the luminosity function changes with the local galaxy density .",
    "colours , morphologies , and central surface brightnesses are not sufficient criteria to confirm cluster membership , as this work has shown . cluster membership can not be confirmed without spectroscopy , so the faint - end luminosity functions calculated for galaxy clusters where membership has not been confirmed spectroscopically are most likely artificially steepened by non - members resulting in higher dwarf - to - giant ratios .    by comparing the observed dwarf spectral absorption indices with population synthesis models of @xcite",
    ", we derive luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities for the dwarf galaxies .",
    "a range of ages is observed , ranging from older than 8 gyr to younger than 5 gyr .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the faint cluster members is also not that of a simple homogeneous population , with the younger galaxies typically having higher metallicities .",
    "more observations of dwarf galaxies in rich , nearby cluster environments are required in order to help improve our understanding of the formation scenarios for cluster dwarfs .",
    "further spectroscopic work with a larger sample would also allow better constraints on the ages and metallicities of cluster dwarf galaxies and would help with modelling the formation of such galaxies .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
