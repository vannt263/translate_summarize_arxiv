    "without comparison , the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is the most successful physics model to date , accurately predicting an enormous number of observables with high precision from only a handful of fitted parameters .",
    "the success of the sm may have culminated in 2012 when the atlas and cms experiments announced the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , predicted by the sm as a direct result of the electroweak symmetry breaking which was introduced to provide masses into the theory .",
    "still , there are a number of observations which may not be explained within the sm itself .",
    "most notable among these are the existence of dark matter , the exclusion of gravity and the observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "in addition , there are conceptual theoretical problems with the sm , such as the hierarchy problem , indicating that the sm may only be a low - energy approximation of a more general theory . as such",
    ", the sm should be viewed as an effective theory and a priori higher - dimensional operators , suppressed by powers of a new mass scale @xmath5 should be added to the sm lagrangian . at lower energies , the additional effective operators will generally produce very small corrections due to this suppression .",
    "this concept is further supported by the fact that the only gauge invariant operator allowed at dimension five , and therefore suppressed only by one power of @xmath5 , is the so - called weinberg operator  @xcite , which results in a majorana mass term for the left - handed neutrinos of the sm .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to imagine that the effect of neutrino masses would be among the first observations of physics beyond the sm , which indeed is the case due to neutrino oscillations requiring neutrino mass - squared differences to be non - zero .",
    "neutrino flavour conversion , although at that time not confirmed as such , was first observed in solar neutrino experiments where a discrepancy between the observed flux and the flux predicted by solar models was found  @xcite . since the first robust evidence of neutrino oscillations by the super - kamiokande experiment s observation of atmospheric neutrinos in 1998 @xcite , they have been extensively studied experimentally in a variety of atmospheric , solar , reactor , and accelerator experiments , which have helped to constrain the neutrino mass and mixing parameters to very high precision ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent global fits ) .",
    "the remaining questions in neutrino oscillation physics today are the neutrino mass ordering , the existence or non - existence of cp violation in the lepton sector and the octant of the leptonic mixing angle @xmath1 .",
    "answering these three questions is the main aim of the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments , such as the european spallation source neutrino super - beam ( ess@xmath0sb ) experiment @xcite , which is a proposed accelerator neutrino experiment based on the european spallation source ( ess ) currently under construction in lund , sweden .",
    "the sensitivity of ess@xmath0sb  to the cp - violating phase @xmath2 was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the sensitivity to other standard oscillation parameters was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the sensitivity to light sterile neutrinos in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while the weinberg operator provides the neutrino masses necessary for neutrino oscillations to occur and neutrino oscillations have been firmly established as the leading mechanism behind neutrino flavour conversion , higher - order operators may give rise to sub - leading contributions to the neutrino conversion probabilities and their observation would allow us to gain additional insight into the high - energy completion of the sm and the generation of neutrino masses .",
    "in addition , it may be necessary to consider the robustness of the usual neutrino oscillation parameters when higher - order operators are also considered .",
    "one of the more common types of operators to be investigated in this respect is non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsis ) , which are effective four - fermion operators involving at least one neutrino field . for recent reviews on nsis , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will consider the possible impact of nsis at the ess@xmath0sb  experiment .",
    "we will study both the influence of nsis on the determination of the standard neutrino oscillation parameters and the bounds which ess@xmath0sb  could place on the nsi parameters .",
    "in particular , we will focus on correlations in the determination of the leptonic cp violation and the nsi parameters , which is of large importance for ess@xmath0sb  as the discovery of leptonic cp violation is the major scientific target of this experiment .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsis ] , we will briefly review non - standard neutrino interactions and present the current upper bounds on the source and detector nsi parameters .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : essnusb ] , the setup of the proposed ess@xmath0sb  experiment will be discussed .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : neuosc ] , we will investigate the phenomenology of source and detector nsis at probability and event - rate levels . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the main results of our full computation on source and detector nsis at ess@xmath0sb  will be presented . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sc ] , we will summarize and draw our conclusions .",
    "when considering nsis , we will be confronted with effective four - fermion operators of the type @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are sm fermion fields and @xmath9 are left- and right - handed projections .",
    "these operators are of dimension six and they will therefore appear together with an effective coupling constant of dimension minus two in the effective lagrangian . since we are interested in the nsis of neutrinos , we require that at least one of the fermion fields in the operators is a neutrino field , which implies that the corresponding projection operator must be @xmath10 . furthermore , in order to keep the electromagnetic and strong interactions unbroken , we require that all operators are scalars under transformations of the corresponding gauge groups . due to the weak interaction being broken , we do not impose any constraints on the transformation of the operators under @xmath11 .",
    "it should be mentioned that imposing @xmath11 gauge symmetry on the dimension - six operators would lead to flavour constraints on these operators  @xcite , leaving only a few possible operators without significant constraints due to the non - observation of effective four - charged - fermion processes such as @xmath12 .",
    "the dimension - six operators which break @xmath11 may generally be induced from higher - dimensional operators such as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the higgs field , which are invariant under @xmath11 , but generate @xmath11-breaking terms once the higgs field takes on a vacuum expectation value @xmath15 .",
    "depending on the dimension at which the nsis are generated above the electroweak scale , we may expect the nsi coefficients to scale as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimension and @xmath5 is the energy scale at which the nsis are generated .",
    "the different possible neutrino nsis are generally divided into two categories of effective four - fermion operators . the neutral - current nsis @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a charged fermion field , affects the neutrino flavour propagation in matter for @xmath20 by providing an effective potential analogous to the mikheyev  smirnov",
    " wolfenstein ( msw ) potential @xcite . for the neutral - current nsis to be of importance , relatively large matter potentials and/or high neutrino energies are required . as this is not the case for the ess@xmath0sb  experiment",
    ", we will not focus on such nsis in this work . on the other hand , the charged - current nsis @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath19 and @xmath22 are different fermion fields such that the operator is invariant under @xmath23 and @xmath24 , will instead affect the production and detection processes of neutrinos and this effect will not depend on the neutrino energy or the presence of matter along the neutrino propagation .    in the remainder of this work",
    ", we will focus on the charged - current nsi lagrangian @xmath25 which includes the operators that will appear in neutrino production by pion decays @xmath26 and charged - current neutrino detection processes . here , we have normalised the strength of the nsis to that of the weak interaction by the introduction of the fermi coupling constant @xmath27",
    ". the nsi parameters @xmath28 are therefore dimensionless numbers expected to be of the order @xmath29 . with the introduction of charged - current nsis , the production amplitude of the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath30 in the @xmath31 , which in the sm is proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the leptonic mixing matrix , is now instead proportional to @xmath34 , where the nsi parameters relevant for the source process are @xmath35 unlike the source process , the detection process does not necessarily involve a pseudoscalar current in the quark sector .",
    "we instead define the nsi parameters relevant for the detection process as @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the quark current in the detection process . due to the nature of the inverse beta decay involved in the detection process",
    ", this definition oversimplifies the neutrino oscillation probabilities that we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : neuosc ] . ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the probability for a given source / detector nsi .",
    "note that the largest prefactor comes from the contribution with the source and detector effects both dependent on the axial quark current .",
    "this would therefore indicate a relation between the source and detector nsis .",
    "] however , we will use this as a simplified model for how nsis may affect ess@xmath0sb .",
    "the complex conjugate and change of indices has been introduced to adhere to the usual convention in the field when considering detector nsi effects .",
    "the production rates of charged leptons at the detector in any neutrino oscillation experiment will be affected by this change in the production and detection amplitudes and we may ask the question whether or not the presence of such nsis could be measured or have a negative impact on the experimental precision to the standard oscillation parameters . the experimental bounds ( at the 90% c.l . ) on the nsi parameters relevant for the ess@xmath0sb  experiment from non - oscillation experiments are given by @xcite @xmath39 although these bounds are quite stringent , it should be kept in mind that the next generation of neutrino experiments is aiming for highly sensitive measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters . as such , even sub - leading effects may be of interest and it is worth the effort to examine the possible impact of these effects .",
    "it is also worth noting that new oscillation experiments , such as those performed with nuclear reactors , may be sensitive to some of these nsi parameters as well  @xcite .",
    "however , the current bounds from these experiments are somewhat weaker than the bounds quoted above  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe the experimental setup for the proposed ess@xmath0sb  experiment .",
    "we have used the standard flux ( with 2 gev protons ) and cross - sections from the ess@xmath0sb  collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the source provides a neutrino beam for two years and an antineutrino beam for eight years .",
    "we have assumed that a 500 kiloton water cherenkov detector is placed at a distance of 540 km from the source , which corresponds to the location of the mine in garpenberg , sweden .",
    "the detector specifications have been taken from the performance study of the memphys detector  @xcite .",
    "the energy range of interest is up to 2 gev , which is divided into 20 energy bins .",
    "we have used 9% ( 18% ) systematic errors on the signal ( background ) events . unless specified otherwise , we have also assumed the existence of a near detector with mass 1 kiloton , 1 km from the source and the same flux as at the detector at 540 km scaled by the distance - squared . as a crude approximation",
    ", we assume the same characteristics for both these detectors .    to this end",
    ", we have written our own probability engine to calculate the neutrino oscillation probability in the presence of source and detector nsis .",
    "this probability engine interfaces with globes  @xcite for calculating the neutrino event rates at ess@xmath0sb . the large parameter space is handled with the help of the globes plugin montecubes  @xcite .",
    "standard three - flavour neutrino oscillations depend on six fundamental parameters  two mass - squared differences , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , three mixing angles , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath1 and one cp - violating phase @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , if the neutrinos are propagating through matter , the charged - current interactions of the neutrinos with electrons modify the oscillations .",
    "this effect can be incorporated into the probability formalism by using the msw potential term @xmath44 @xcite , where @xmath45 is the number density of electrons in the matter and @xmath46 is the neutrino energy . for an experiment like ess@xmath0sb  with a short baseline length as well as low neutrino energy",
    ", we can ignore the matter effects for the sake of this discussion .",
    "( the numerical results presented in this work do not make any such assumption . )",
    "non - standard neutrino interactions can affect the production and detection of neutrinos at the source and detector , respectively . in the sm ,",
    "interactions of charged leptons with neutrinos are strictly flavour - diagonal .",
    "however , charged - current nsis can introduce a non - zero overlap between charged leptons and neutrinos of different flavours .",
    "thus , a neutrino produced at a source in association with a charged lepton @xmath47 is not simply @xmath48 , but is given by @xcite @xmath49 similarly , a neutrino that produces a charged lepton @xmath50 in a detector is @xmath51 the matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are in general complex , giving 36 new parameters .",
    "these are 9 amplitudes and 9 phases of each nsi parameter in the source and detector nsi matrices .",
    "not all of the 36 nsi parameters are relevant for the experiment under consideration",
    ". since we are only interested in the oscillation channels @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( and their cp conjugates ) , the relevant parameters are @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the parameter space is reduced to 9 complex or 18 real parameters , in addition to the standard ones . in this work ,",
    "we treat all of them as independent parameters , which is the most general case .    deriving an analytical formula for the neutrino oscillation probabilities",
    "is difficult even in the standard three - flavour scenario .",
    "typically , expressions for the probabilities are given as perturbative expansions in small parameters such as @xmath60 or @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "for the discussion in this section , we refer to the analytical formulae for vacuum oscillation probabilities derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , which include source and detector nsis .",
    "these formulae are valid up to second order in @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and up to first order in the nsi parameters .",
    "it is easy to observe that linearizing the expressions in the nsi parameters and ignoring cubic and higher order terms overall , leaves only a few nsi parameters in the expressions .",
    "for instance , in the case of the vacuum probability @xmath62 , only the nsi parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath63 are present up to linear order .",
    "while these approximate analytical formulae provide useful insights into the physics of nsis in neutrino oscillations , we stress that all simulation results presented in this work make use of numerically computed neutrino oscillation probabilities without approximations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] , we have plotted the variation of the neutrino oscillation probability @xmath62 with the amplitude of each of the relevant nsi parameters .",
    "the range of values chosen for the nsi parameters is the 90% c.l .",
    "bounds on them as listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bounds ] ) .",
    "each of the probabilities shown are calculated numerically , using @xmath64 , @xmath65 and normal neutrino mass ordering ; and all other nsi parameters , including phases , set to zero . out of the three nsi parameters present up to linear order",
    ", the variation due to @xmath63 is the strongest , while that due to @xmath4 is the weakest .",
    "this pattern follows from the allowed range given by the current bounds . out of the remaining three",
    ", @xmath66 has the greatest effect , which is again because it is not very tightly constrained by current data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we have investigated the effects of source and detector nsis at the proposed neutrino oscillation experiment ess@xmath0sb , with a baseline of 540 km  the source being the ess in lund , sweden and a memphys - like detector in garpenberg , sweden .",
    "the ess@xmath0sb   experiment is designed to determine the leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath2 at the second oscillation maximum .",
    "however , it may also be able to probe source and detector nsis . due to the short baseline length and low neutrino energy of this experiment , matter nsis will not be of importance , and are therefore not considered in this work .",
    "first , we have studied the three - flavour neutrino oscillation probabilities with source and detector nsis , which depend on six relevant nsi parameters ",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath4 and @xmath63 .",
    "we used perturbative analytical expressions for the @xmath54 channel that is the important channel for ess@xmath0sbin which @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath63 are the dominating nsi parameters in order to observe the impact of these parameters .",
    "we have found that , for the range of values allowed by the current data , the nsi parameter @xmath63 affect this probability the most , whereas the nsi parameter @xmath4 the least .",
    "all other four nsi parameters have intermediate influence on the probability .",
    "second , we have explored the effect of marginalizing over the nsi parameters on precision measurements at ess@xmath0sb  using two cases : ( i ) the true values of the nsi parameters are set to zero and ( ii ) the true values are set to half of the current 90% c.l",
    ".  bounds . in both cases ,",
    "the precision of measuring @xmath2 is reduced by at most a factor of two .",
    "in addition , a measurement of the leptonic mixing angle @xmath1 is not affected by nsis .",
    "if we do not take the effect of nsis into account when determining the value of @xmath2 , we obtain over - optimistic results .",
    "the effect is most pronounced for a true value of @xmath69 .",
    "note that the impact of nsis on the results are qualitatively same for both no and io .",
    "third , we have determined the possibility of ess@xmath0sb  to measure the values of the nsi parameters . in a realistic case with all nsi parameters free ,",
    "we have found limits on @xmath3 and @xmath4 at 90% c.l .  that are similar to the existing limits in the literature , whereas in a optimistic case with only one nsi parameter free and the rest set to zero , the limits on @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are improved by a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , we have set the true values of the nsi parameters to half of their existing bound , and found that ess@xmath0sb  is not able to differentiate the set values from zero at 68% c.l . or impose any significant constraints on the phases of the nsi parameters .",
    "finally , we have examined the influence of the presence of a near detector at the ess@xmath0sb  experimental setup .",
    "indeed , we show that without a near detector the results would be more pessimistic concerning both the sensitivity of @xmath2 and the limits on the nsi parameters .",
    "note that the results are not changed significantly by reducing the systematic errors .",
    "in conclusion , using ess@xmath0sb  with a near detector , the presence of nsis will at most reduce the measurement of @xmath2 by a factor of two , while a measurement of @xmath1 will remain robust .",
    "in addition , it is possible to improve the existing upper limits on some of the nsi parameters by a factors of two .",
