    "the observations of significant amounts of dust in high redshift quasars ( bertoldi et al .  2003 ; priddey et al .  2003 ; robson et al .",
    "2004 ; beelen et al .  2006 ; wang et al .",
    "2008 ) have highlighted the requirement for an alternative to asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars as the dominant dust factories in the early universe ( e.g. , maiolino et al .",
    "2004 , valiante et al .  2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "an ideal alternative are core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , since the short main sequence time of their progenitor stars allows them to enrich the interstellar medium with the first solids with no noticeable delay on cosmological timescales .",
    "theoretical calculations of the dust yields of ccsne , however , have produced controversial results .",
    "calculations based on the classical nucleation theory ( e.g. , feder et al .  1966 ) typically predict the prompt formation of fairly large amounts of dust , of the order of one solar mass or more , within one year from the explosion ( kozasa et al.1989 , 1991 ; clayton et al .",
    "2001 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2010 ) .",
    "the result is robust to the unknown parameters of the theory , such as the shape and sticking coefficients of the grains , at least to first order ( fallest et al .",
    "on the other hand , calculations that model the formation of solid grains with a chemical network with well - defined reaction rates resulted in the prediction of only modest amount of dust , its condensation starting only years after the supernova explosion ( cherchneff & dwek 2009 , 2010 ; sarangi & cherchneff 2013 ; biscaro & cherchneff 2014 ) .",
    "such calculations , however , can not follow the grain formation up to large molecular clusters and/or micron - sized crystals .",
    "most current results only predict the formation of molecular precursors , such as c@xmath0 . a recent paper ( sarangi et al .",
    "2015 ) follows carbon cluster formation up to c@xmath1 , assuming that coalescence is responsible for the growth of astrophysical grains from the clusters .",
    "the discrepancy between the two theoretical predictions seems to be brought about by the approximations and intrinsic limitations of the two theories .",
    "calculations based on the nucleation theory assume that the grain formation happens in virtual isolation , ignoring the fact that the growing proto - grains are exposed to the rich field of damaging radiation of a young supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "they also assume that even the smallest molecular clusters are continuum entities , ignoring their atomic structure and quantum behaviour . on the other hand ,",
    "chemical network calculations provide a deterministic growth of grains and therefore ignore the fact that , as grains grow beyond the molecular cluster phase , self shielding allow the few grains that grew by statistical fluctuations to become more and more resilient and grow even further . chemical calculations , as such , ignore the fact that grain growth becomes a runaway process , the few grains able to make it beyond a few hundred monomers allowed to grow and become stable .    not surprisingly , observations of nearby core - collapse supernovae ( sn1987a and , only recently , sn2010jl ) are in disagreement with both results .",
    "they show dust formation beginning as early as half a year after the explosion ( gall et al .",
    "2014 ; earlier dust formation being possible but hidden under the more abundant curcumstellar dust component ) , in disagreement with chemical network results .",
    "the early dust formation , however , is modest , at most a fraction of a per cent of a solar mass being condensed ( in disagreement with the classical nucleation results ) . to add confusion to the picture , recent herschel ( matsuura et al .",
    "2013 ) and alma ( indebetouw et al .",
    "2014 ) observations of sn1987a show the presence of large amounts of dust in emission in the center of the remnant .",
    "taken at face value , the collective data from all nearby core - collapse supernovae suggests a scenario in which dust formation is a slow and continuous process that starts at most a few months after core collapse and continues for at least several years , eventually yielding amounts of solid particles totalling approximately one solar mass .",
    "not all core - collapse supernovae may be dust producers , however .",
    "in a recent study , szalai & vink ( 2013 ) find that only two out of twelve type ii - p sne show signs of newly sinthsized dust in emission .",
    "connecting the chemistry of the molecular precursor with a formalism for dust growth is necessary to properly describe the formation and growth of grains into stable microscopic solids ( sarangi & cherchneff 2015 ) . in this paper",
    "we present a new framework for the calculation of dust formation in supernova explosions based on the kinetic nucleation theory ( e.g. , kashchiev 2000 ) .",
    "whereas the kinetic nucleation theory is equivalent to the standard thermodynamic theory for homologous nucleation in isolation , it allows to introduce deviations from the capillary approximation for very small clusters and chemical weathering of the forming grains in the harsh supernova environment .",
    "the theory is presented , and applied as a proof of concept , to the formation of carbonaceous grains , but can be readily extended to the formation of any grain species , provided that its susceptibility to weathering in the remnant environment is known .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we present the chemical network and the nucleation theory that we adopt . in section  3",
    "we describe the stellar explosions model adopted and in section  4 we present out results .",
    "a summary and discussion are in section  5 .",

    "we describe the physical processes and the techniques used to compute such concentrations .",
    "the reactions considered are : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a compton electron consequence of the energy deposited by the decay of @xmath4ni into @xmath4co and eventually @xmath4fe and @xmath5 is a free electron in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas",

    ". reactions  [ reac:3 ] and  [ reac:4 ] are the ionization and recombination of h atoms as a consequence of the presence of non - thermal electron .",
    "reaction  [ reac:5 ] is the formation of carbon monoxide molecules by radiative association , and reactions  [ reac:6 ] , [ reac:7 ] , and  [ reac:7bis ] are the destruction of the co molecule due to thermal effects , interaction with non - thermal electrons , and charge - exchange with he@xmath6 cations , respectively .",
    "reactions  [ reac : o ] and  [ reac : he ] are the chemical weathering reactions in which the carbon clusters or grains lose one carbon atom by reaction with a free oxygen atom ( oxidation ) or he ion ( ion - molecule ) . finally , reactions  [ reac:10 ] and  [ reac:11 ] are the monomer attachment and spontaneous detachment reactions to and from carbon clusters .",
    "the network considered here is much smaller than the one used by cherchneff & dwek ( 2009 , 2010 ) . in this paper , however , we are focusing on the carbonaceous nucleation only rather than following all possible dust species .",
    "in addition , the main goal of this work is to study the interplay between chemistry and nucleation with an hybrid approach that allows us to consider carbon clusters both as molecules , subject to interactions with other species , and as small solids , capable of growing indefinitely .      to compute the density of free electrons and of the hii and heii cations",
    ", we calculate the balance between the ionization rate due to interaction with compton electrons and recombination from the bath of thermal electrons .",

[ fig:69_mol ] ]    in this section we present the results of our calculations focusing on the differences between results from the carbon nucleation , growth and weathering presented here with respect to more traditional calculations based on classical nucleation theory and alternative approaches that aim at taking into account the chemistry involved in the formation of the small dust seeds",
    "let us first look in detail at the temporal evolution of the properties of a few representative single shells .",
    "we chose three representative shells zones ( table  [ zones ] ) in the unmixed stellar progenitor model ( figure  [ fig : unm_massfrac ] ) .",
    "zone   is located at the @xmath34 mass coordinate , and is characterized by a marked oxygen overabundance with respect to carbon ( approximately three orders of magnitude ) .",
    "zone   is located at mass coordinate @xmath35 and has approximately equal abundances of c and o. it is also the most carbon - rich zone in the whole ejecta .",
    "finally , zone   is located at mass coordinate @xmath36 well outside the region were explosive nucleosynthesis was active .",
    "it is characterized by an overabundance of o by a factor @xmath37 with respect to c. the thickness of each zone is small and within each of them the densities and thermodynamic properties are constant at any given time .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the three zones ( temperature , density , and expansion velocity ) is shown in figure  [ fig : dynevol ] .",
    "but for zone   ( table [ zones ] ) .",
    "[ fig:209_mol ] ]    figures  [ fig:69_mol ] , [ fig:209_mol ] , and  [ fig:556_mol ] show the temporal evolution of the ejecta composition in the three selected zones for the unmixed progenitor model . despite some differences ,",
    "all the plots show some important common features .",
    "first , the formation of the co molecule is never efficient enough to completely absorb all the carbon , even in zone  , where oxygen is largely overabundant with respect to carbon ( see analogous results by clayton et al .",
    "2001 ; deneault et al .",
    "2006 , and clayton 2013 ) .",
    "second , a sizable fraction of he is ionized to the @xmath38 cation , and its weathering effect can delay dust formation .",
    "this is particularly clear in zone  , where dust initially forms quickly at @xmath39 months after the explosion .",
    "the @xmath38 concentration , however , peaks a few months later causing a temporary decrease in the dust fraction . eventually , the ionized he fraction drops again and dust nucleation and growth resume .",
    "this result not only shows the important effects of weathering in the supernova environment , it also shows that the customary assumption that once a grain has grown beyond the critical size it only grows further is inaccurate .",
    "weathering can become dominant and shrink or completely destroy the already formed grains .",
    "oxidation is also important in limiting the dust formation and growth .",
    "its effect , however , is less clear in the figures because the o abundance is constant with time .",
    "the rate of the he - c@xmath40 ion - molecule reaction is also approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the oxidation reaction , making the cation the most damaging weathering agent in all regions except for those in which oxygen is particularly abundant .",
    "but for zone   ( table  [ zones ] ) .",
    "[ fig:556_mol ] ]    figures  [ fig:69_mol ] , [ fig:209_mol ] , and  [ fig:556_mol ] also show that the dust condensation time and its efficiency vary significantly across the remnant .",
    "condensation is significantly delayed in the inner mass coordinate , starting only @xmath412 years after core - collapse .",
    "mostly due to atomic carbon depletion into co , the dust condensation efficiency is very small in zone  . in the carbon - rich area of zone  , instead , dust formation sets in early , but is subsequently reversed into dust destruction by the increasing ionization of helium . only a few years after core collapse dust formation reaches its final efficiency , almost @xmath42 .",
    "finally , no dust is formed in the outer layers of the star ( zone  ) .    a fundamental role in altering the nucleation pattern of carbonaceous dust is also played by the difficulty in forming the dimer , as discussed above .",
    "figure  [ fig : j_209 ] shows the saturation , nucleation rate , and critical size of the forming carbon grains as a function of time for zone  .",
    "we first note that saturation does not play the same role that it does in the thermodynamic theory of homogeneous nucleation . in that case",
    ", the solid phase is expected to start nucleating as soon as saturation grows above a few . in our calculation",
    ", saturation can grow to extremely high values , as large as a double precision real number can handle . yet , nucleation proceeds slowly , and can even be turned off while the saturation is increasing .",
    "what we see in the figure is that initially , as saturation becomes larger than one , a spike of nucleation is observed ( at @xmath39  months ) . during this phase the spontaneous ejection of monomers from unstable carbon clusters dominates over the oxidation and charge - exchange rates . as usual , in this phase the growth of the saturation produces an increased nucleation rate and smaller critical size . differently from classical calculations , however , our nucleation rate is limited by the dimer formation rate ( eq .  [ eq : c2 ] ) .    ) , nucleation rate ( @xmath43 ) and critical size of zone   ( table  [ zones ] ) .",
    "[ fig : j_209 ] ]    ]    as time progresses , the concentration of heii cations increases and the charge - exchange weathering process becomes dominant , shutting off entirely the nucleation of new grains and shrinking the already existing ones ( see the decreasing dust mass fraction between @xmath44 and @xmath45  months in figure  [ fig:209_mol ] ) . in this period ,",
    "the saturation becomes virtually infinite .",
    "yet , nucleation is entirely shut off because the weathering rate is larger than the accretion rate of carbon atoms on any size grain . at later times",
    "( @xmath46  months ) the charge - exchange weathering still dominates the ejection rate , but the accretion of carbon atoms now dominates the rates .",
    "nucleation can therefore proceed , with a formal critical size of two atoms .",
    "again , the nucleation rate is constrained by the rate of the formation of the dimer .",
    "the plots for the other two zones are analogous , but with only a subset of the phenomenology of what seen in zone  .",
    "the inner zone   does not have enough carbon to trigger the initial burst of dust formation , and nucleation is postponed until @xmath47  years , when the ion - molecule weathering rate becomes smaller than the accretion rate .",
    "the nucleation takes place very slowly , being limited by the rate of dimer formation . for the outer zone  , instead",
    ", nucleation never takes place , because the carbon abundance is so low compared to the he abundance that charge - exchange weathering is always dominating over the growth of carbon clusters .",
    "let us now look at nucleation and growth of carbonaceous dust in the whole ejecta .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the comparison of the final grain size distributions at 5 years past the core collapse for the mixed and unmixed models .",
    "both distributions have been normalized to unit integral to facilitate the comparison and a dashed line has been added to show the classical mrn interstellar size distribution ( mathis et al .  1977 ) .",
    "in both cases we obtain a broad size distribution that is somewhat steeper than the mrn distribution .",
    "the mixed progenitor model gives a bigger upper limit for the grain size . since the gain population still needs to cross the reverse shock , where the smallest grains are likely to be destroyed by sputtering ( nozawa et al .",
    "2006 ; bianchi & schneider 2007 ) , the small differences seen here could be much more substantial when the dust is recycled into the interstellar medium .    ]    in the following , we consider a suite of codes with different assumptions to compare and understand the effect of adding new processes in the dust formation process .",
    "the first code , which is labeled as `` classical '' in the figures , adopts the standard assumptions of classical calculations . in this version of the code",
    ", nucleation takes place only in regions where the number density of carbon atoms is larger than that of oxygen atoms .",
    "the nucleation rate is computed according to the thermodynamic theory as ( e.g. , fallest et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) : @xmath48 where we adopt the value @xmath49dyne / cm for the amorphous carbon surface energy . within this theory ,",
    "the critical grain size can be found analytically as @xmath50 this dust model was applied only to the unmixed progenitor , since the mixed one does not have any zone in which @xmath51 .    ]    ]    the second model we adopt is a slight modification of the `` classical '' one , in which the formation and destruction of the co is followed as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : co ] .",
    "this allows for the formation of carbonaceous dust even in regions with @xmath52 , and therefore the model is run on both our mixed and unmixed progenitor models .",
    "the results are labeled in the figures as `` unmix , co '' and `` mix , co '' .",
    "finally , our full code described in sect .",
    "2 was applied to both the mixed and unmixed progenitor models .",
    "the results are labeled in the figures as just `` mixed '' and `` unmixed '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : dust_mass ] shows the time evolution of the total mass condensed in carbonaceous grains . as expected , we see that all models based on classical nucleation have a sharp rise in the dust mass , due to a catastrophic dust formation event at about @xmath53 months after core collapse .",
    "the dust mass is subsequently constant .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the continuum dust condensation detected in a sample of ccsn ( gall et al .",
    "2014 ) and shown with the magenta symbols that represent dust detections in the remnant of sn1987a ( wooden et al.1993 ; ercolano et al .  2007 ;",
    "matsuura et al .  2013 ; indebetouw et al.2014 ) .",
    "the `` mixed '' and `` unmixed '' models , instead , show a more continuous formation of dust , starting approximately at @xmath53 months ( as for the classical models ) . yet , even the more progressive dust formation of the mixed and unmixed models including weathering is still too fast to fully reproduce the observations .",
    "dust formation in our simulations is continuously active for at least @xmath54 years after core collapse , after which our calculations were halted .",
    "extending the calculations for longer times is possible but not simple , since the thermal balance of the remnant becomes much more complex .",
    "condensation is not expected to proceed much further , however , since in all the dust formation zones most of the available carbon has already been used by year @xmath54 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : effi ] , where the efficiency is plotted for the various models as a function of the mass coordinate .",
    "efficiency here is defined as the ratio of the mass of carbon in grains over the total mass of carbon .",
    "where dust formation takes place , it is almost inevitably highly efficient ( @xmath55 ) , converting the vast majority of carbon into solid grains .",
    "this is not a trivial result .",
    "consider , for example , model `` mix , co '' .",
    "in all the zones oxygen is overabundant with respect to carbon .",
    "one might think , therefore , that most of the carbon should remain locked in co molecules instead of condensing in carbonaceous grains .",
    "instead , we see that while the co molecule does form , it is continuously dissociated by compton electrons .",
    "grains instead , once they have managed to grow beyond a certain size , are much more resilient due to the fact that only the surface can be weathered by oxidation and ion - molecule reactions .",
    "in addition , compton electrons are not damaging to grains because of the huge mass difference .",
    "classical models with co formation / dissociation , therefore , have virtually @xmath42 condensation efficiency of all carbon into grains across the entire star .",
    "the classical model without co dissociation , instead , has @xmath42 efficiency but only in those zones where @xmath51 .     of the total carbon",
    "is condensed into grains .",
    "[ fig : cond_time ] ]    the behavior of the complete models is more complex .",
    "dust condensation takes place only in the inner part of the star , within about @xmath56 solar masses from the center . in this case",
    ", the reason for the lack of condensation at large distances from the center of the star is the large number of he cations that erode the carbon clusters before they can reach a size large enough to become self - shielded . by the time",
    "the radioactivity has ceased and the @xmath38 fraction decreases , the gas is too diffuse and cold for efficient nucleation . yet , as discussed above , efficiency is large where condensation takes place , almost always exceeding @xmath57 , and therefore we do not expect to see much dust mass growth beyond the five years of the computation .",
    "figure  [ fig : co_mass ] shows instead the mass of co in the entire remnant for the various models ( except the classical model , for which the co molecule is not considered ) as a function of time .",
    "theoretical predictions are compared against the measurement of co in the remnant of sn1987a ( spyromilio et al .",
    "also in this case the theoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with the data , the mixed model performing better than the unmixed one .",
    "detailed agreement is not expected since the ccsn progenitor model is not designed to closely reproduce the progenitor of sn1987a .",
    "figure  [ fig : cond_time ] shows the condensation times of the grains as a function of the mass coordinate . here",
    "we define the condensation time as the time at which half of the local carbon is converted into grains .",
    "the classical models , again , show the lowest diversity , with dust forming at about seven months at all distances .",
    "the complete models show instead a distance dependent condensation history .",
    "the mixed model , owing to it smoother profile of abundances , has a somewhat monotonic dependence with the earliest formation just outside of the stellar core , and progressively longer formation times out to a mass coordinate of @xmath58 where the efficiency drops below @xmath57 and the condensation time is no longer well - defined .",
    "the unmixed model has instead a more diverse behavior affected by both the sharp composition changes and the dust formation physics .",
    "either way , different condensation times at different radii are the cause of the more progressive dust formation history seen in figure  [ fig : dust_mass ] for the complete models .",
    "years post core collapse as a function of the mass coordinate for the various dust condensation models .",
    "[ fig : av_size ] ]    finally , figure  [ fig : av_size ] shows the average grain size in each zone at the end of the calculation .",
    "none of the models has a clearly understandable pattern , with the exception of the complete mixed model , for which the biggest grains are formed close to the core .",
    "grains that form earlier have more time to grow and therefore are eventually bigger .",
    "the average size , however , depends also on the rate at which nucleation takes place , and from the speed at which carbon initially locked into co molecules is released for use in dust condensation .",
    "we have presented a calculation of carbonaceous dust formation in a @xmath59 progenitor star exploding as a core - collapse supernova .",
    "our study is based on a novel nucleation code that was developed to address the particular conditions of the exploding supernova .",
    "this is a rapidly evolving environment with plenty of ionizing radiation and reactive agents that can harm the forming grains .",
    "our code uses the kinetic theory of nucleation in order to be suitable for possible non - steady state conditions in the fast evolving remnant .",
    "in addition , the flexibility of the kinetic theory allows us to relax the capillary approximation for the dimer ( @xmath60 ) formation and to include the effect of oxidation and ion - molecule reactions in the calculation . an alternative framework for joining",
    "the chemical and nucleation approaches has been recently presented by sarangi & cherchneff ( 2015 ) .",
    "their approach differs fundamentally from what presented in this paper in that the chemical phase is joined to a coalescence phase , rather than to a growth phase .",
    "this means that in their scheme carbon clusters form up to a maximum size of ten atoms until all the carbon gas has been used and subsequently grow by coagulation with other clusters rather than grow by adsorption of gas monomers ( or molecules ) .",
    "we find that , at least for carbon , the chance of collisions of molecular clusters with monomers is far larger than with other clusters . in our calculations monomers",
    "are more abundant than clusters and , being lighter , have a larger thermal velocity that makes collisions more frequent . as a subsequent step in understanding nucleation , however , the coagulation and growth should be integrated and taken into account simultaneously .    with respect to classical calculations ( kozasa et al .  1989 , 1991 ;",
    "todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .  2003 ; fallest et al .",
    "2011 ) and to the results of sarangi & cherchneff ( 2015 ) , we find that our new code predicts a much more gradual carbon dust formation , beginning just a few months after the core collapse and continuing for a few years . despite the more gradual formation , however , we are not able to fully reproduce the observational results that require an even more gradual and continuous dust formation in the ejecta , with dust appearing as early as two months after core collapse and gradually increasing for a few years to a decade ( gall et al .",
    "2014 ) eventually leading to a highly efficient condensation of a sizable fraction of a solar mass ( indebetouw et al .",
    "addition of non - carbonaceous dust chemistry ( e.g. , sarangi & cherchneff 2015 ) and/or a fully three - dimensional calculation ( lazzati & fallest , in preparation ) can ameliorate the discrepancy .",
    "it must be also noted that the explosion model plays a role in the grain formation . a less energetic explosion than the one we used ( or one with more massive ejecta ) would result in higher densities and temperatures at long timescales , allowing for a longer period of growth and , potentially , more dust condensation . on the other hand , a more energetic explosion or one with lighter ejecta would result in colder and less dense gas , likely going earlier into freeze - out .",
    "the role of explosion diversity is certainly as important as the proper dimensionality of the simulation , since a 3d model is likely going to contain both faster and slower ejecta than the 1d spherically simmetric model presented here and elswhere in the literature .    even though we consider this work a step forward towards a complete understanding of dust formation in stellar explosions ( and in general ) , it is still plagued by some serious limitations .",
    "the most obvious is the fact that we consider only carbonaceous dust , while more species are known to condensate in supernova explosions .",
    "condensation of silicates and other dust species can begin earlier and explain the early dust formation observed in some sne ( wooden et al.1993 ; gall et al .",
    "2014 ; sarangi & cherchneff 2015 ) . on a more fundamental level",
    ", our code still assumes a constant sticking coefficient @xmath61 , a spherical shape for the forming grains , down to the smallest sizes , and the capillary approximation of a size - independent surface energy for any cluster with @xmath62 .",
    "all these are important limitations that need to be corrected ( see , e.g. , mauney & lazzati 2015 ) before a serious comparison with data can be performed . as any nucleation based work",
    ", we also assume that grain formation and growth takes place by addition of single carbon atoms , and that grain erosion as well takes place by removing one atom at a time from a cluster .",
    "reactions that cause the splitting of a cluster in two fragments are not considered , even though they might be important , especially at low temperature ( see , e.g. , wakelam et al.2009 ) .",
    "another important issue is whether the chemical and nucleation approaches are fully consistent with each other . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] , that might not be the case , creating a serious issue when they are joined .",
    "more theoretical and experimental work needs to be devoted to understanding the formation rates of carbon clusters with a few up to a few tens of atoms , and the relative importance of radiative and non - radiative association processes need to be pinned down from first principles .",
    "the reaction network is also incomplete , lacking the consideration of the effect of other potentially harmful cations , such as ar@xmath6 and ne@xmath6 .",
    "the role of these cations in silicate nucleation and growth was included in the work of sarangi & cherchneff ( 2013 , 2015 ) , but ion - molecule reaction rates for such cations with carbon clusters are not available in the literature and are therefore omitted in this work .",

    "<S> core - collapse supernovae are considered to be important contributors to the primitive dust enrichment of the interstellar medium in the high - redshift universe . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical models of dust formation in stellar explosions have so far provided controversial results and a generally poor fit to the observations of dust formation in local supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new methodology for the calculation of carbonaceous dust formation in young supernova remnants . </S>",
    "<S> our new technique uses both the nucleation theory and a chemical reaction network to allow us to compute the dust growth beyond the molecular level as well as to consider chemical erosion of the forming grains . </S>",
    "<S> we find that carbonaceous dust forms efficiently in the core of the ejecta , but takes several years to condensate , longer than previously estimated . </S>",
    "<S> it forms unevenly and remains concentrated in the inner part of the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the role of core - collapse supernovae as dust factories and provide new insight on the observations of sn  1987a , in which large amounts of dust have been detected to form on a timescale of years after core collapse . </S>"
