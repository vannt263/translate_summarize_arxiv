    "the rank of @xmath287 is equal to the rank of @xmath42 if and only if @xmath288 with smooth coefficient functions @xmath289 .",

    "so , the vectors @xmath296 and @xmath297 are linearly dependent .",

    "are fiber bundles @xmath15 , and our examples are fiber bundle maps mostly over the 2-sphere @xmath299 .",

    ", we consider as an example the geodesic flow on the 2-sphere , which is generated by a vector field on the tangent bundle @xmath308 .",
    "we embed @xmath309 by @xmath310 , together with the requirement that the euclidean dot products for @xmath0 and @xmath311 satisfy @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",

    "the geodesic flow can be viewed as a hamiltonian flow whose energy is given by @xmath319 .",
    "the rank of @xmath302 is 1 , except on the stationary submanifold @xmath320 , where it equals 0 .",
    "hence , @xmath302 is submersive on @xmath316 and satisfies @xmath301=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the dynamics is exactly lumpable for @xmath302 by proposition [ pr : frstintgrl ] .",
    "the kernel of @xmath18 is simply the distribution spanned by @xmath7 .",
    "this is trivially invariant under the flow @xmath57 generated by @xmath7 , since @xmath324 by definition and @xmath325 .",
    "exact lumpability then follows from corollary [ cr : invflow ] .    to exemplify this proposition , we now consider the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of the 2-sphere @xmath326 .",
    "we claim that it is exactly lumpable for the cross product @xmath327 and use the above proposition to show this .",
    "there is an isomorphism @xcite between the unit tangent bundle @xmath326 and @xmath328 , given by @xmath329 , where @xmath330 , @xmath331 , and @xmath332 , or in compressed notation @xmath333 .",
    "so , for any @xmath334 this matrix maps to another point @xmath335 , and there is a collection of lumping candidates indexed by @xmath336 .",
    "we choose @xmath337 and calculate the vector field induced by @xmath338 : @xmath339 thus , the dynamics on @xmath326 lies in the kernel of @xmath42 .",

    "this is illustrated in figure [ fg : geoflow ] . by proposition [ pr :",
    "orbitspace ] , @xmath18 is an exact lumping .",
    "we next discuss the relation of lumpability to the symmetries of the system .",

    "we denote by @xmath344 the left action of the lie group on @xmath0 and @xmath345 the corresponding action of the lie algebra .",
    "the action on the whole algebra is denoted by @xmath346 .      by the quotient manifold theorem",
    "@xcite the quotient map of a proper and free lie group action is a submersion and the quotient space has a natural smooth manifold structure .",
    "the vector fields that generate the action are annihilated by the differential of the quotient map ; therefore , @xmath349 and so proposition [ pr : main3 ] implies exact lumpability .",
    "the converse statement to proposition [ pr : main5 ] is not true . given a vector field @xmath7 and a lumping @xmath18 , the level sets need not be orbits of a proper and free lie group action .",
    "the integrable distribution of a free lie group action is spanned by its linearly independent generators making @xmath347 a finitely generated submodule of the sections of @xmath9 .",
    "there are many integrable distributions that are not finitely generated and thus do not stem from a lie group action .",
    "any section of such a distribution gives rise to a lumping that does not stem from a lie group action .",
    "the hopf fibration over @xmath340 , @xmath350 illustrates proposition [ pr : main5 ] .",
    "we use the formulation of the hopf map in terms of the quaternions @xmath351 , which is the vector space @xmath352 together with an involution @xmath353 and an algebra product @xmath354 .",

    "it is totally antisymmetric in its indices .",
    "the involution acts as @xmath363 .",
    "the 3-sphere @xmath364 can be embedded into @xmath357 by @xmath365 . to each unit quaternion @xmath366",
    "one can associate an element in @xmath328 , acting on purely imaginary quaternions @xmath367 by @xmath368 one can show that the mapping @xmath369 is a smooth , nondegenerate , two - to - one , surjective assignment of any @xmath27 to an element of @xmath328 and that @xmath364 is in fact the double cover of @xmath328 .",
    "hence there is a collection of submersions @xmath370 indexed by vectors @xmath371 that act like @xmath372 .",
    "choosing @xmath373 and setting @xmath374 we get @xmath375 as one example of a hopf map .",
    "alternatively , one can describe this map as the quotient of a @xmath376 action on @xmath377 .",
    "we use the abreviation @xmath378 , @xmath379 , @xmath380 , and @xmath381 .",
    "they satisfy the quaternion algebra @xmath382 .",
    "the @xmath376 action @xmath383 is generated by the vector field @xmath384 .",
    "we now show that @xmath18 is the quotient map of the @xmath376-action .",
    "the differential of is given by @xmath385 a calculation reveals that @xmath386 , and @xmath56 spans @xmath125 since @xmath18 is a submersion and @xmath125 is one - dimensional .",
    "having introduced the lumping map @xmath387 in the framework of quaternions and the lie algebra action , generated by @xmath56 , we now proceed with the example .",
    "there is a collection of vector fields @xmath388 , indexed by @xmath389 , given by @xmath390 which is exactly lumpable for @xmath18 as in .",
    "we will now show that this follows from proposition [ pr : main5 ] .",
    "the lie group @xmath376 is compact ; so , its action is proper and , since @xmath56 is nowhere vanishing , it is also free .",
    "we check whether @xmath391 : @xmath392_\\alpha=&w_\\mu\\frac{\\partial ( v_c)_\\alpha}{\\partial x_\\mu}-(v_c)_\\mu\\frac{\\partial w_\\alpha}{\\partial x_\\mu}\\nonumber\\\\    = & + ( x_1c_2-x_0c_3-x_2c_1+x_0c_3-\\epsilon_{3kl}x_kc_l)\\delta_{\\alpha 0}\\nonumber\\\\    & -(x_0c_2+\\epsilon_{2kl}x_l c_k)\\delta_{\\alpha 1}+(x_0c_1\\epsilon_{1kl}x_lc_k)\\delta_{\\alpha 2}+(x_jc_j - x_0c_0)\\delta_{\\alpha 3 }    \\nonumber\\\\&-(x_3c_j-\\epsilon_{jk1}x_2c_k+\\epsilon_{jk2}x_1c_k-\\epsilon_{jk3}x_0c_k)\\delta_{\\alpha j}\\nonumber\\\\    = & \\;\\,0\\;.\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so we invoke proposition [ pr : main5 ] which implies lumpability .",
    "in fact , @xmath393 the lumped dynamics for the vector field that generates quaternion rotations @xmath394 under the quotient map @xmath18 is @xmath395 .",
    "clearly it runs tangent to the sphere since @xmath396 for @xmath397 .",
    "let @xmath398 be a forward ( resp . ,",
    "backward ) invariant set , i.e. for all @xmath399 the flow preserves the invariant set @xmath400 ( resp . , @xmath401 ) . after a projection with the lumping map , @xmath402 ( resp . , @xmath403 ) .",
    "invoking the lumping condition from proposition [ pr : main2 ] yields @xmath404",
    "so , @xmath405 is a forward ( resp . , backward ) invariant set of @xmath121 .",
    "this property can be exploited to determine invariant sets of the dynamics by finding the stationary points of a 1-dimensional exact lumping .",
    "we conclude with a final example which also illustrates this feature . for a set of real coefficients @xmath406 which are not all zero , the logistic dynamics @xmath407 has two invariant sets @xmath408 and @xmath409 that are preserved under the lumping map @xmath410 . with @xmath411",
    "we calculate @xmath412 and find that @xmath413 is the lumped dynamics .",
