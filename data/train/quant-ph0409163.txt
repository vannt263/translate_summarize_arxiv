    "laser radiation provides a means to control intra - molecular processes in a robust manner because of a conservation law that comes into play when monochromatic radiation interacts with nonlinear systems .",
    "the origin of this conservation law is the discrete time - translation invariance of laser driven systems . for radiation interacting with molecular systems ,",
    "this conservation law gives rise to stable electron - photon ( phonon - photon , roton - photon ) structures described by conserved eigenstates ( the floquet states ) of the driven system .",
    "floquet states are exact eigenstates of periodically driven systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their reality can be seen in recent atom - optic experiments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where millions of sodium @xcite or cesium atoms @xcite , interacting with a time - modulated standing wave of light , underwent large coherent periodic oscillations in momentum in a multi - photon process .",
    "these coherent oscillations were subsequently found to be due to the interference of only two or three floquet eigenstates whose phase space structure was determined by an underlying chaotic sea induced by the interaction between the atoms and the light @xcite . in this paper , we wish to show that similar mechanisms are important when laser pulses interact with intra - molecular forces",
    ". we will focus on the exact dynamics underlying stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) for laser pulses interacting with a simple model of intra - molecular dynamics .",
    "stirap has become an important tool for coherently controlling and changing the vibration and electronic states of entire molecular populations with close to 100@xmath0 efficiency .",
    "stirap involves the application of short laser pulses with carefully chosen carrier frequencies to a molecular system for the purpose of exciting the molecules in a controlled manner .",
    "this technique causes a coherent change in the entire molecular population between molecular states .",
    "traditional models of stirap generally view the molecular target as a simplified multilevel system . indeed ,",
    "traditional stirap focuses on three carefully chosen vibration and/or electronic levels .",
    "there are no studies , that we know of , that look at the effect on stirap of the actual nonlinear dynamics that occurs when the laser pulses interact with a molecular system .",
    "however , we know that laser pulses can induce chaos and this can strongly affect the response of the molecule to the laser field .",
    "in addition the internal dynamics of the molecule may itself be exhibiting the manifestations of chaos and simple pictures of the molecular level structure are likely not valid . understanding this dynamics is very important for extending stirap to wider ranges of molecules    in this paper we study the _ exact dynamics _ underlying stirap for a model system that contains the essential features of low energy vibration states , or rotational states , of a diatomic molecule driven by two laser pulses .",
    "we will find , for example , that in phase space regions where the laser pulses create chaos , the molecule can be transferred coherently into energy states very different from those predicted by traditional stirap .",
    "it appears that a transition to chaos may provide a new tool to control the outcome of these processes in molecular systems .",
    "stirap was first proposed by hioe @xcite , @xcite and later confirmed in an experiment involving population transfer between vibration - rotation states of sodium dimers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are several variations to stirap which generally is described as a process involving three particular energy levels , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , of a collection of atoms or molecules of interest .",
    "all atoms or molecules are initially in the lowest energy state @xmath3 .",
    "two laser pulses then impinge sequentially on the system in order to make a transition toward the target state @xmath2 . in the  ladder \" version of stirap the target state @xmath2 is the highest state in energy and in the ",
    "lambda \" version of the stirap the intermediate state @xmath4 is the highest state in energy .",
    "the first laser pulse couples @xmath4 and @xmath2 which contain no population , and the second laser pulse then couples @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as a result of these processes , the entire atomic or molecular population is transferred coherently into the target state without populating the intermediate state after the laser pulses have passed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", conventional stirap analyzes an atomic or molecular system in terms of three carefully chosen energy levels of the unperturbed system .",
    "however , complications arise in real applications since these systems are composed of multiple states due to the rotational , vibration , and electronic levels of the unperturbed system .",
    "extension of stirap to multilevel systems has been discussed by a number of authors , generally in terms of simplified models using the rotating wave approximation and three or more laser pulses @xcite .",
    "alternatively , raman chirped adiabatic passage schemes @xcite , in which the frequency of the incident laser pulse is continuously changed , have also been proposed to allow the system to climb through a sequence of molecular energy levels .    in this paper",
    "we take a different approach to the problem .",
    "we consider the _ exact dynamics _ that takes place when the two laser pulses impinge on a multi - level system .",
    "instead of isolating a certain number of levels of interest and analyzing the process in terms of the rotating wave approximation , we will let the full multilevel dynamics evolve and allow the system to tell us how many levels we must keep to accurately describe the atomic or molecular dynamics when a radiation field is present . unlike the previous studies which utilize more than two pulses in multi - level systems , we only apply two pulses and allow as many levels as dictated by the dynamics participate in the process .",
    "one way to see how many levels must be kept is to look at the underlying classical phase space of the system of interest .",
    "the laser field , when interacting with nonlinear intra - molecular dynamics will induce nonlinear resonances and chaos in localized regions of the phase space .",
    "those structures in the classical phase space which have a size greater than planck s constant determine the structure of the floquet eigenstates of the system , and thereby have a direct influence on the stirap process .",
    "the model we use to study the effect of chaos on stirap in a multi - level system is that of a particle in an infinite square - well potential @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the infinite square - well potential is an anharmonic potential of the form @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "it can give some insight into the behavior of low lying vibration states , or rotation states , of molecular systems in the presence of sequential laser pulses .",
    "an approximate version of the square - well potential we consider here could also be constructed in an atom - optics experiment @xcite or in semi - conductor heterostructures .",
    "the dynamics of a particle in an infinite square - well potential is also interesting because the laser pulses can cause the low energy particle states to undergo a transition to chaos @xcite , @xcite . for the case of monochromatic laser fields , this transition to chaos",
    "is accompanied by a plateau of high harmonic radiation whose cut - off is determined by the width in energy of the chaotic sea induced by the laser field @xcite .    in the sections below",
    ", we describe the behavior of a particle in an infinite square - well potential which is driven by two sequential laser pulses whose carrier frequencies are monochromatic and chosen to couple specific unperturbed energy levels of the particle in the square - well potential .",
    "we will find that for the case when the pulse amplitudes vary slowly in time so that the adiabatic theorem @xcite is satisfied , the dynamics can be described in terms `` snapshots '' of the underlying classical phase space at selected times as the laser pulses pass through the system . in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the classical dynamics that results from the laser pulses . in sect .",
    "3 , we discuss how we will describe the quantum dynamics for the driven system . in sect .",
    "4 we introduce floquet theory . in sects . 5 , 6 and 7",
    "we show that a dynamics quite different from that of the traditional stirap ladder model can occur in multilevel systems due to the presence of chaos , even for fairly weak pulse amplitudes . finally in sect .",
    "8 we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the model system for this study is a particle located in an infinite square well potential with spatial width , @xmath7 .",
    "the potential energy has the form , @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the position of the particle .",
    "the classical hamiltonian which describes the dynamics of a particle of mass @xmath13 moving in the potential well and driven by two sequential pulses of monochromatic radiation is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the momentum of the particle , @xmath16 is the time , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the carrier frequencies of the first and second pulses , respectively .",
    "the amplitude of the first ( second ) pulse at time @xmath19 is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "if we rescale parameters using @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is planck s constant , then the hamiltonian is @xmath29 and all parameters are dimensionless .",
    "the energy has been re - scaled in units of @xmath30 in order to make comparisons with the corresponding quantum system in subsequent sections .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 have gaussian shape of the form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we can control the duration of each pulse by adjusting the parameter @xmath35 and we can control the amount of overlap of the two pulses by changing @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the maximum amplitude @xmath38 and the width @xmath35 of the two pulses are the same . a schematic picture of the variation in time of the amplitudes of the two pulses is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the first pulse is turned on and drives the particle in the square well and then , with an appropriate delay time , the second pulse is turned on .",
    "the whole pulse sequence ends at the total pulse duration time @xmath39 . for the purpose of marking time intervals in our subsequent discussion , we choose times , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42",
    ".    we will be interested in how the classical phase space behaves in the _ adiabatic limit _ where the pulses are turned on and off very slowly relative to certain intrinsic time scales in the system , such as the periods of the carrier frequencies . in this limit the amplitudes , @xmath43 and @xmath44 remain essentially constant during time intervals where the cosine terms oscillate many times .",
    "we can get an idea of the structure of the phase space by plotting a poincare surface of section of the phase space for fixed pulse amplitudes @xcite .",
    "thus we also consider the hamiltonian @xmath45 where the amplitudes are set to constants by choosing their value at some fixed time @xmath46 .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ tpham ] is time - periodic and we can view the behavior of the phase space using poincare surfaces of section @xcite .",
    "the poincare surfaces of section for time - periodic hamiltonians are strobe plots of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. plots of @xmath47 and @xmath48 each time the hamiltonian goes through one complete oscillation in time .",
    "we can perform a canonical transformation to action - angle variables @xmath49 defined @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the hamiltonian then has the form , @xmath52 an infinite number of nonlinear resonances are produced in the classical phase space by the external fields .",
    "the _ primary resonances _ are located at @xmath53 .",

    "the frequencies of the oscillations in figs . 6.b and 6.c",

    "thus , from the classical phase space we see that it requires approximately twelve square - well energy eigenstates to accurately describe the dynamics of this system .",
    "the floquet matrix that we use to describe the quantum dynamics is a @xmath239 matrix .",

    "thus , multiple avoided crossings behave differently from isolated pairs of avoided crossings where the states simply interchange character .",
    "multiple avoided crossings provide a mechanism for the spread of the manifestations of chaos in quantum systems @xcite .    it is useful to note that there is an isolated avoided crossing at @xmath260 that causes states @xmath242 and @xmath249 to switch from @xmath261 and @xmath262 , as they enter the avoided crossing at @xmath263 , to @xmath264 and @xmath265 as they leave .",

    "the adiabatic case is shown in fig . 15.b .",
    "we now choose @xmath274 .",
    "the probabilities now closely follow the behavior of the single floquet eigenstate @xmath177 as can be seen in fig .",
    "12.a . after the pulses have passed , the final state of the system is @xmath275 .",
    "this transition dynamics is determined by the structure of the avoided crossings in the floquet eigenphase curves and by the phase space structure of the floquet eigenstates at the avoided crossing .",
    "the phase space structure of the floquet eigenstates ( see the husimi plots ) is determined by structures in the underlying classical phase space which are greater than planck s constant .",
    "the transition from @xmath210 to @xmath276 occurs because at the time of the transition the classical phase space is connected by a chaotic sea from @xmath277 to @xmath237 and a strongly distorted kam region at @xmath238 which allows the quantum state to tunnel into the phase space region around @xmath238 .",
    "this can be seen from the husimi plot for the state @xmath177 at time @xmath278 which is shown in fig . 16 .",
    "the unperturbed levels , @xmath150 , @xmath152 and @xmath279 are connected via the chaotic sea around the two @xmath77 primary resonances which exist at the time @xmath278 .",
    "the final case we consider is a lambda process in which the system is driven by pulses with carrier frequencies @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "these frequencies are commensurate and the period of the hamiltonian and the floquet frequency are again @xmath158 and @xmath283 , respectively . to stay as close to case ii parameters as possible , we chose pulse amplitudes @xmath271 .",
    "although this case looks similar to case ii , we will find quite different results .    in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "the transition @xmath284 occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "15.c , which is very different from case ii .",
    "we believe that the difference between these two processes is due to the difference in the phase space distribution of the resonances and chaos induced in the system by the laser pulses .",
    "strobe plots of the classical phase space for the lambda case for times @xmath80 , @xmath178 , @xmath285 , and @xmath85 are shown in figs .",

    "ii , a pathway is opened by a chaotic sea that allows a floquet state to tunnel across the entire energy region ( see fig .",
    "16 ) from @xmath181 to @xmath227 at the time of the avoided crossing . in the strobe plots of the classical phase space in fig .",
    "17 for case iii , this pathway is blocked by kam tori which do not allow the quantum system to tunnel out of the low energy region .",
    "we also find fewer avoided crossings in the plot of the floquet eigenphases for this case .",
    "we have found that sequential laser pulses , when applied to a particle in an anharmonic multilevel system , can induce nonlinear resonances and a transition to chaos in the dynamics of the particle . the extent of the region influenced by resonances and chaos determines the number of unperturbed energy eigenstates that must be kept to form the basis used to construct the floquet matrix and to determine the quantum dynamics .",
    "when the pulses are applied in a manner which adiabatically changes the dynamics of the particle , this transition to chaos can be used to control the coherent transfer of the particle across the chaotic sea from a low lying energy state to a highly excited energy state .",
    "floquet theory provides an accurate means of describing the dynamical behavior of these driven systems in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the type of population transfer that is allowed depends on the nature of the floquet eigenphase avoided crossings created by the underlying transition to chaos and the ability of the corresponding floquet eigenstates to tunnel across vast regions of the phase space because of the induced chaos . in the cases i and ii , avoided crossings occurred between floquet eigenstates which had spread throughout the available phase space , and a coherent flow of probability from the low energy side to the high energy side of the chaotic sea occurred . in case iii , the path to the high energy states around the resonance at @xmath230 appears to be blocked by kam tori and the transition to the higher energy states does not occur .    in molecular systems ,",
    "the success of stirap will depend on the state of the dynamics of the unperturbed molecular system , and on the changes in that dynamics induced by the laser pulses .",
    "most molecular systems have regimes of internal chaos and the interplay of these regimes with the dynamics induced by the laser pulses is critical to understanding stirap in these system .",
