    "there are two schools of thought as to the origin of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the first school holds that , after formation of the galactic disk , there was a very weak seed field of order @xmath2gauss or so , and that this field was amplified to its present strength by dynamo action driven by interstellar turbulence .",
    "the description of how this happens is well known(ruzmaikin , shukorov and sokoloff 1988 ) , and is summarized by the mean field dynamo theory .",
    "the second school of thought concerning the origin of the galactic field is , that it is primordial .",
    "that is , it is assumed that there was a reasonably strong magnetic field present in the plasma before it collapsed to form the galaxy .",
    "it is assumed that the field was coherent in direction and magnitude prior to galactic formation .",
    "the actual origin of the magnetic field is not specified .",
    "however , it could be formed by dynamo action during the actual formation of the galaxy , ( kulsrud et al 1996 ) .",
    "this paper discusses the evolution of the structure and strength of such a primordial magnetic field during the life of the galaxy .",
    "the origin of the field prior to formation of the galaxy is not considered .",
    "it was fermi(1949 ) who first proposed that the galactic magnetic field was of primordial origin .",
    "piddington(1957 , 1964 , 1967 , 1981 ) in a number of papers suggested how this might actually have happened .",
    "however , he supposed the magnetic field strong enough to influence the collapse .",
    "one of the first problems with the primordial origin is the wrap up problem .",
    "it was pointed out by hoyle and ireland(1960 , 1961 ) and by @xmath3 et .",
    "al . ( 1964 ) , that the field would wrap up into a spiral similar to the spiral arms in only two or three galactic rotations .",
    "it was supposed that this is the natural shape of the magnetic field lines .",
    "if the winding up continued for the fifty or so rotations of the galaxy , the field lines would reverse in direction every one hundred parsecs .",
    "this seemed absurd .",
    "the various attempts to get around this problem involved magnetic fields which were strong enough to control the flow , and also strong radial outflows .",
    "several forceful arguments against the primordial origin were advanced by parker .",
    "the arguments were that the field would be expelled from the galaxy , either by ambipolar diffusion(parker 1968 ) , or by rapid turbulent diffusion(parker 1973a , 1973b )    in this paper we reexamine the problem of a a primordial field .",
    "we proceed along lines first initiated by piddington . just as in his model for the primordial field , we start with a cosmic field with lines of force threading the galaxy .",
    "we further assume that , after the collapse to the disk , the lines remain threaded through the galactic disk .",
    "the lines enter the lower boundary of the disk in a vertical direction , extend a short horizontal distance in the disk , and then leave through the upper boundary .",
    "thus , each line initially extends a finite horizontal distance in the disk .",
    "however , in contrast to piddington s model , we assume the field is too weak to affect the plasma motions , especially the rotational motion about the galactic center . consequently , it tends to be wrapped up by the differential rotation of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , we include additional physics of the interstellar medium in which the magnetic field evolves .",
    "after toroidal stretching strengthens the toroidal field sufficiently , a strong vertical force is exerted on the ionized part of the interstellar medium forcing it through the neutral part .",
    "we contend that this force will not expel the entire lines of force from the galactic disk , but the resulting ambipolar velocity will only tend to shorten the length which each line spends in the disk as it threads through it . in particular , ambipolar diffusion will decrease the radial component of the horizontal field and shorten its radial extent in the disk .",
    "this will decrease the toroidal stretching of the field line , and as a result the magnetic field strength will approach a slowly decreasing saturated condition . thus , after several gigayears , the lines will end up extending a longer distance in the azimuthal direction than they did initially , but a much shorter distance in the radial direction . at",
    "any given time after the field saturates , the final strength will be independent of its initial value .",
    "in addition , the field strength will depend only on the ambipolar properties of the interstellar medium .",
    "[ for earlier work see howard ( 1995 ) and kulsrud(1986 , 1989 , 1990 ) . ]    as a consequence of ambipolar diffusion plus stretching , the magnetic field will be almost entirely toroidal , and it will have the same strength everywhere at a fixed time . however , its sign will depend on the sign of the initial radial component of the field at its initial position . because of differential rotation the toroidal field will still vary rapidly in sign over a radial distance of about one hundred parsecs .",
    "this model for the magnetic field evolution would seem at first to leave us with a wrap up problem and produce a field at variance with the observed field .",
    "however , the initial regions where the radial field is of one sign are expected to be of different area than those of the other sign provided that the initial field is not exactly uniform . as a consequence , at the present time in any given region of the galaxy",
    ", the toroidal field should have a larger extent of one sign than of the other , even , though the sign varies rapidly .",
    "if one now averages over larger regions than the size of variation , one would see a mean magnetic field of one sign .",
    "this averaging is actually performed by the finite resolution of the observations of the magnetic field in our galaxy or in external galaxies . from the observations one would not be aware of this rapid variation .",
    "if one ignored the spiral arms , the field would be almost completely azimuthal .",
    "however , it is known that the density compression in the spiral density wave , twists the magnetic field to be parallel to the spiral arm and increases its field strength ( manchester 1974 , roberts and yuan 1970 ) . in observing radio emission from external galaxies ,",
    "one tends to see the radiation mostly from the spiral arm , where cosmic rays are intense and the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "because in these regions the field is aligned along the arms , one would naturally get the impression that the field extends along the entire arm .",
    "in fact , on the basis of our model , one would actually be seeing short pieces of field lines pieced together as they cross the spiral arm and thread through the disk .",
    "the magnetic field would be mainly azimuthal in between the spiral arms , and only as it crosses the arm would it be twisted to align along the arm .",
    "observationally the magnetic field of this model would appear the same as that of a large scale magnetic field .",
    "similarly , one should see faraday rotation which is proportional to the amount by which the effect of the toroidal field of one sign exceeds the other sign in this region",
    ". the amount of rotation produced by any one region would be related to difference in areas occupied by the fields of different sign .",
    "this in turn , is given by the amount by which the initial area at the initial position where the radial field is of one sign exceeds the initial area where the radial field is of opposite sign .",
    "in parker s",
    "argument(parker 1973a , 1973b ) concerning the expulsion of the primordial field he introduces the concept of turbulent mixing .",
    "turbulent mixing correctly describes the rate at which the mean field will decrease by mixing .",
    "however , it can not change the number of lines of force threading the disk , since this is fixed by their topology .",
    "it only gives the lines a displacement .",
    "since , near the edge of the disk , the turbulent motions probably decrease as the sources of turbulence do , it is not expected that the lines will be mixed into the halo .",
    "also , because of their topology the lines are not lost .",
    "only the length of their extent in the disk can be altered by turbulence .",
    "hence , for our model , turbulent diffusion need not destroy the primordial field as parker suggested .",
    "also , blowing bubbles in the lines by cosmic ray pressure will always leave the remainder of the line behind , and the total number of lines unaltered .",
    "of course , if the lines were entirely horizontal , ambipolar diffusion could destroy the field , since the lines may be lifted out of the disk bodily(parker 1968 ) .",
    "therefore , parker s contention that the primordial field has a short life , need not apply , to our model .      the model which we consider is very simple .",
    "we start with a large ball of plasma whose mass is equal to the galactic mass , but whose radius is much larger than the current size of our galaxy ( figure 1a ) .",
    "we first assume that the magnetic field filling this sphere is uniform , and makes a finite angle @xmath4 with the rotation axis of the galaxy .",
    "then we allow the ball to collapse to a sphere the size of the galaxy ( figure 1b ) , and finally to a disk the thickness of the galactic disk ( figure 1c ) .",
    "we assume the first collapse is radial and uniform , while the second collapse into the disk is linear and one dimensional .    during the time when the galaxy contracts uniformly into the disk along the @xmath5 direction , where @xmath6 is in the direction of @xmath7 , we ignore any rotation .",
    "then the resulting magnetic field configuration is as in fig , ( 1c ) .",
    "the horizontal component of the magnetic field has been amplified by the large compressional factor , while the vertical component is unchanged , so that the resulting field is nearly parallel to the galactic disk . at this stage ,",
    "some lines enter the disk from the top and leave from the top , e.g. line @xmath8 .",
    "some lines enter from the bottom and leave through the top , e.g. lines @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "finally , some lines enter from the bottom and leave through the bottom , e.g. line @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that lines such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 are eventually expelled from the disk by ambipolar diffusion , so that we ignore them .",
    "now , set the disk into differential rotation at time @xmath14 .",
    "( if we include the rotation during collapse the magnetic field will start to wind up earlier . however , the result would be the same as though we were to ignore the rotation during collapse , and then after the collapse let the disk rotate by an additional amount equal to the amount by which the disk rotated during the collapse .",
    "this is true provided that the initial field is too weak for ambipolar diffusion to be important . )",
    "we here summarize the conclusions that we found from the detailed analysis of our model , given in the body of this paper .",
    "initially , after the disk forms , all the lines have a horizontal component that is larger than the vertical component by a factor equal to the radius of the disk divided by its thickness @xmath15 .",
    "this is the case if the initial angle @xmath4 was of order 45 degrees or at least not near 0 or 90 degrees .",
    "now , because of neglect of rotation in the collapse , the horizontal component of all the field lines is in a single direction , the @xmath16 direction say , so that @xmath17 after @xmath14 the differential rotation of the disk stretches the radial magnetic field into the toroidal direction so that , following a given fluid element whose initial angle is @xmath18 , one has @xmath19   { \\bf { \\hat \\theta } } + b_i   ( d \\tan \\alpha /r ) { \\bf   \\hat{z } } .",
    "\\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] after a few rotations the second component dominates the first and third components .",
    "it is seen that the total magnetic field strength grows linearly with time .",
    "after the toroidal magnetic field becomes strong enough , the magnetic force on the ionized part of the disk forces it through the neutral component , primarily in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "consider a single line of force .",
    "let us turn off the differential rotation for a moment . in this case , the @xmath20 motion steepens the line of force , but does not change the vertical field component .",
    "this leads to a shortening of the line , both in the radial direction and in the azimuthal direction ( see figure 1d ) .",
    "now , let the differential rotation continue . because the radial component of the magnetic field is reduced , the toroidal component increases more slowly .",
    "eventually , there comes a time when the radial field is small enough that the shortening motions in the azimuthal direction are stronger than the stretching motion , and the azimuthal component of the magnetic field actually decreases even in the presence of differential rotation . from this time on , the magnetic field strength decreases at a rate such that the vertical ambipolar velocity is just enough to move the plasma a distance approximately equal to the thickness of the galactic disk , in the time @xmath21 , i. e. @xmath22 now , @xmath23 is essentially proportional to the average of the square of the magnetic field strength",
    ". therefore , for a uniform partially ionized plasma we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the half thickness of the disk , @xmath26 is the ion mass density , and where @xmath27 is the ion neutral collision rate .",
    "thus , for asymptotically long times one finds that @xmath28 that is , the magnetic field strength approaches a saturated time behavior independent of its initial value .",
    "the saturated time behavior only depends on the ambipolar diffusion properties of the interstellar medium , and on the time @xmath21 .",
    "however , the time to reach saturation does depend on the initial value of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the qualitative behavior is shown in figure 2 , where the dependence of @xmath29 on time for different initial values is shown . for a very weak initial radial component of the field ,",
    "saturation is not reached during a hubble time . however , for fields substantially larger than the critical initial field strength for reaching saturation , the final saturated field is independent of the initial radial field .    in the interstellar medium ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion is not well modeled by diffusion through a uniform plasma .",
    "in fact , the bulk of the mass of the interstellar medium is in dark clouds , in which the degree of ionization is very low .",
    "also , the outward magnetic force is concentrated in the volume of the clouds . as a result",
    "the ambipolar diffusion velocity is more accurately given by the formula @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the filling factor for the clouds , @xmath26 is the effective ion density in the clouds , @xmath27 is the effective ion - neutral collision rate in the clouds , and @xmath32 is the ratio of cosmic ray pressure to magnetic pressure .    the model for the interstellar medium , which we employ to study the magnetic field evolution , is sketched in figure 3 .",
    "the magnetic field is anchored in the clouds whose gravitational mass holds the magnetic field in the galactic disk .",
    "the magnetic field lines bow up in between the clouds pulled outward by magnetic pressure and by cosmic ray pressure .",
    "the outward force is balanced by ion ",
    "neutral friction in the clouds themselves .",
    "a derivation of equation 6 based on this model is given in section 5 .",
    "taking plausible values for the properties of the clouds , one finds that the critical initial value of the magnetic field , for it to reach saturation in a hubble time is about @xmath33 gauss .",
    "further , the saturated value of the field at @xmath34 years is estimated to be 2 microgauss . at this field strength the time to diffuse across the disk @xmath35 years , which is of order of the lifetime of the disk .",
    "finally , let us consider the structure of the saturated field .",
    "the time evolution of the magnetic field refers to the field in the rotating frame .",
    "thus , if we wish the toroidal field at time @xmath21 and at @xmath36 we need to know the initial radial component of the field at @xmath37 .",
    "thus , assuming that the field reaches a saturation value of @xmath38 , one has @xmath39 where the sign is plus or minus according to the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] since @xmath41 depends on @xmath42 , we see that @xmath43 changes sign over a distance @xmath44 such that @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 taking the rotation period of the galaxy to be 200 million years , one finds for @xmath47 years , @xmath48 parsecs .",
    "therefore , because the field saturates to a constant field strength , it is predicted that a uniform initial field , that has a value greater than @xmath49 gauss , immediately after the collapse to the disk , leads to a toroidal field that varies with @xmath42 , at fixed @xmath50 , as a square wave with a reversal in sign every @xmath51 parsecs or so .",
    "such a field structure would produce no net faraday rotation and would contradict observations .",
    "however , this result can be traced to our assumption that the initial magnetic field in figure 1 was entirely uniform .",
    "suppose it were not uniform .",
    "then , after collapse , the radial field is not purely sinusoidal ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "in fact , one expects a behavior more like @xmath52 , \\label{eq:10}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is an index of the nonuniformity . as an example , for moderately small @xmath54 is positive for @xmath55 and negative for @xmath56    therefore the radial extent in which @xmath57 is negative is larger than the radial extent in which it is positive by a factor @xmath58 the resulting field is positive over a smaller range of @xmath42 than the range in which it is negative .",
    "consequently , in such a magnetic field there would be a net faraday rotation of polarized radio sources .",
    "note that it is easily possible that the regions in which the radial field is initially weaker can end up as regions that dominate in flux over those region that come from regions in which the radial field was stronger ! now ,",
    "if one averages this field over regions much larger than @xmath51 parsecs , then the resulting mean field is smooth and axisymmetric .",
    "this result is contrary to the generally held belief that a primordial field should lead to a field with bisymmetric symmetry(sofue et al 1986 ) .",
    "this result alone shows that a more careful treatment of the evolution of the primordial field , such as that discussed above , leads to quite different results from those commonly assumed .",
    "( however , as mentioned above , including the effect of the spiral density wave will produce a magnetic field lines in the spiral arms that will appear to have bisymmetrical shape . )",
    "we emphasize that , although the actual magnetic field derived in our model is a tightly wound spiral , the magnetic field averaged over a moderate size scale appears to be smooth and axisymmetric .",
    "a second important conclusion of our model is that because of their topology , the field lines can not not be expelled from the disk by ambipolar diffusion . the same line of force diffuses downward in the lower part of the disk , and upward in the upper part of the disk",
    ". the line must thus continue to be threaded through the disk .",
    "( see lines @xmath59 and @xmath60 in figure 1c . )",
    "a third conclusion that can be drawn from our model is that any single line after saturation has only a finite extent in the disk .",
    "for example , if the initial field is a few microgauss , then it turns out that the line only extends a radian or so before leaving the disk .",
    "this finite extent of the magnetic lines would make the escape of cosmic rays from the galaxy possible without the necessity of any disconnection of the magnetic field lines in the interstellar medium .",
    "a final conclusion that should be noted is , that the saturated magnetic field of our model has a mean field strength smaller than the rms field strength .",
    "this has the consequence that different methods for measuring the magnitude of the magnetic field strength should lead to different results .",
    "the measurement by nonthermal radio emission of the cosmic ray electrons measures the rms field strength while faraday rotation measures the mean strength .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows :    in section 2 an analytic model is developed to demonstrate the properties described in this introduction .    in section 3 a more precise one dimensional numerical simulation",
    "is carried out that confirms the evolution of the field in the @xmath20 direction given in section 2 .    in section 4",
    "it is shown that the three dimensional equations for the evolution of the field can be reduced to two independent variables .",
    "these are @xmath20 and an angular coordinate @xmath61 that is constant along the spirals generated by the differential rotation of the galaxy .",
    "a numerical simulation of the resulting differential equations is carried out .",
    "it is shown that after a long time the resulting magnetic field does evolve locally in the essentially same way as is given in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "in addition , it varies in radius as a square wave with uneven lobes .    in section 5 the astrophysics of the interstellar medium clouds is discussed , and a derivation is given of expression 6 , for the effective mean ambipolar motion of the field in the disk .    in the concluding section 6 ,",
    "the implications of this model for the evolution of a magnetic field of primordial origin are given .",
    "the bearing of these implications on the various criticisms of the primordial field hypothesis are discussed .",
    "in this and the next section we wish to consider the local behavior of the magnetic field following a fluid element that moves with the galactic rotation .",
    "if the ambipolar diffusion were strictly in the @xmath20 direction , the evolution of the field in a given fluid element would be independent of its behavior in other fluid elements at different @xmath42 or @xmath50 .",
    "it would only be affected by the differential rotation of the galaxy , and by ambipolar velocity in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "thus , in particular , we could imagine the magnetic field at different values of @xmath50 , behaving in an identical manner .",
    "in other words , we could replace the general problem by an axisymmetric one .",
    "let @xmath62 let us neglect the radial velocity , and let the ambipolar velocity be only in the @xmath63 direction and proportional to the @xmath20 derivative of the magnetic field strength squared . also , let us neglect any turbulent velocity .",
    "the only velocities which we consider are the differential rotation of the galaxy , @xmath64 , and the ambipolar diffusion velocity of the ions .",
    "then @xmath65 where @xmath66 where @xmath67 where as in the introduction @xmath32 is the ratio of the cosmic ray pressure to the magnetic pressure , @xmath26 is the ion density , and , @xmath27 is the ion - neutral collision rate in the clouds .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the magnetic field is @xmath68 or , in components , @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    we integrate these equations numerically in section 3 .",
    "they are too difficult to handle analytically . to treat them approximately",
    ", we make the assumption that for all time @xmath72 and @xmath43 vary parabolically in @xmath20 i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are functions of time .",
    "we apply equation  [ eq:17 ] and equation  [ eq:18 ] at @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , and solve for @xmath78 and @xmath79 as functions of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , making use of equations 16 , 18 and 19 , we find @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 where everything is evaluated at @xmath83 so we drop the superscripts on @xmath72 and @xmath43 .",
    "since for galactic rotation @xmath84 is essentially constant , we have @xmath85 .    initially @xmath72 and @xmath43 are of the same order of magnitude . also , we expect @xmath43 to grow , by stretching , to a value much greater than its initial value , before ambipolar diffusion becomes important .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we make the choice of initial conditions @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the initial value for the radial component of the field . according to equation  [ eq:2 ] , @xmath88 for a fluid element starting at @xmath50 , for a fluid element starting at @xmath50 .",
    "now , if initially @xmath89 , then according to equation  [ eq:24 ] , we expect @xmath43 to at first grow linearly in time , then by equation  [ eq:25 ] , @xmath23 increases quadratically in time till @xmath90 , and the ambipolar velocity starts to affect the evolution of @xmath43 and @xmath72 . if the initial field is small , then the contribution of @xmath72 to the ambipolar diffusion velocity is never important . in this case",
    "we can write @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the solution to the differential equation  [ eq:23 ] and equation  [ eq:24 ] with @xmath23 given by equation  [ eq:26 ] is @xmath93 @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( the above solution , equations 28 and 29 , of equations 24 , 25 , and 27 , is derived explicitly in appendix a. however , it can be shown by direct substitution that it is a solution of equations 24 , 25 , and 27 . )    from these equations we see that for @xmath96 @xmath72 is unchanged , @xmath43 increases as @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , so that up to this time ambipolar diffusion carries the plasma only a small fraction of the disk thickness .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath99 then @xmath100 and @xmath43 is independent of both the initial value of @xmath72 and of @xmath41 .",
    "it depends only on the ambipolar diffusion properties of the interstellar medium .    for all @xmath101",
    ", we have @xmath102 so for @xmath103 years , @xmath104 , and the field becomes strongly toroidal .",
    "the question arises as to how strong @xmath87 must be in order that the saturated solution , equation  [ eq:32 ] , is reached .",
    "taking @xmath105 , the hubble time , and making use of the expression for @xmath106 , one finds from equation  [ eq:31 ] that for saturation to be reached we must have @xmath107    making use of the numbers derived in section 5 one finds that if @xmath43 is saturated at @xmath105 , then @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the ion density in the clouds , assumed to be ionized carbon , and @xmath110 is the mean hydrogen density in the interstellar medium .",
    "the densities are in cgs units .    for saturation ,",
    "the critical value for @xmath87 is @xmath111 where the densities are in cgs units .",
    "hence , for the above properties of the clouds and for an initial radial field greater than the critical value , the magnetic field at @xmath105 saturates at about the presently observed value .",
    "such a field arises from compression if , when the galaxy was a sphere of radius @xmath112 kiloparsecs , the magnetic field strength was greater than @xmath113 gauss .",
    "if before this the virialized radius of the protosphere was @xmath51 kiloparsecs , then in this sphere the comoving initial value for the cosmic field strength had to be greater than @xmath114 gauss .",
    "( that is if the cosmic field filled all space then it had to be so strong that the present value of the magnetic field in intergalactic space must now be @xmath115 gauss . )",
    "there are good reasons to believe that a magnetic field stronger than this minimum value could have been generated by turbulence in the protogalaxy during its collapse to this virialized radius ( kulsrud et al .",
    "however , this field would be local to the galaxy and not fill all space .",
    "finally , one expects that @xmath116 , from the initial compression into the disk .",
    "taking @xmath117 as unaffected by the differential stretching and by the ambipolar diffusion velocity , one can derive an expression for the length of a line of force : @xmath118 or @xmath119    thus , for example if @xmath120 gauss , then a line of force passing through the solar position in the galaxy , would stretch once around the galaxy .",
    "stronger initial fields lead to shorter lines of force .",
    "if the initial field is stronger than 2 microgauss , then it is possible that cosmic rays can escape along the lines of force into the halo during their average life time .",
    "it is clear that any gradient of the magnetic field strength will lead to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "however , gradients in the angular direction are weak , so that we may neglect ambipolar diffusion in the angular direction .",
    "similarly , the gradients in the radial direction are weak at first , although as pointed out in the introduction , the magnetic field ends up reversing rapidly in the toroidal direction , so eventually radial ambipolar diffusion becomes as important as vertical ambipolar diffusion .    in this section ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to gradients only in the @xmath121 direction . in this case , the axisymmetric approximation is valid , and the relevant equations are equation  [ eq:17 ] and equation  [ eq:18 ] , where @xmath122 is given by equation  [ eq:15a ] , @xmath123    in the previous section , these equations were reduced to zero dimensions by the _ ansatz _ that @xmath72 and @xmath117 were parabolic in @xmath20 according to equation  [ eq:21 ] and equation  [ eq:22 ] , and the basic equations were applied only at @xmath76 . in the present section we treat these equations numerically for all @xmath20 with @xmath124 , and drop the parabolic assumption .",
    "we treat the disk as uniform so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are taken as constants .",
    "we need boundary conditions at @xmath125 .",
    "we expect @xmath29 to be quite small outside the disk , @xmath126 .",
    "( this is because we suppose that neutrals are absent in the halo and @xmath127 , so that the flow velocity @xmath122 becomes very large .",
    "since flux is conserved , @xmath128 must be a constant in a steady state and the magnetic field must be very small . ) in order to match smoothly to the outer region , we first assume that @xmath26 is a constant for all @xmath20 and is very small .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath27 is constant for @xmath124 , and decreases rapidly to zero in a narrow region , @xmath129 . then because @xmath130 in the halo region , @xmath126 , @xmath122 becomes so large that inertia is important .",
    "the equation for @xmath122 should read @xmath131 where we have set @xmath132 . because the time evolution is over the hubble time @xmath133 , @xmath134 , i.e. @xmath135 is very large compared to @xmath136 .",
    "thus , we drop the partial time derivative .",
    "the equations for @xmath72 and @xmath43 are the same as in the disk . however , because @xmath122 is large the divergence terms @xmath137 and @xmath138 are much larger than the other terms in the region near @xmath139 , and in the halo .",
    "thus , we have @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "this means that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the rate of flow of magnetic flux , and it is a constant in these regions .",
    "( we drop the subscript on @xmath144 )    dividing equation 41 by @xmath26 and dropping the partial time derivative , we get @xmath145 combining this equation with equation  [ eq:43 ] we have @xmath146 or @xmath147 or @xmath148    for @xmath20 larger than @xmath149 , the right hand side becomes a constant , so that @xmath150",

    "hence , @xmath151 and @xmath144 approaches a small value .",
    "this result breaks down when @xmath144 is small enough that the other terms in equation  [ eq:17 ] and equation  [ eq:18 ] become important .",
    "thus , the connection of the main part of the disk to the halo is given by equation  [ eq:47 ] @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "transforming this to an equation for @xmath29 we have @xmath154 where @xmath155 , and where @xmath156 is the value of @xmath5 where @xmath157 .",
    "let us write @xmath158 , where on the right hand side @xmath159 denotes the constant value of @xmath160 in the disk .",
    "then for @xmath20 far enough into the disk , equation  [ eq:50 ] reduces to @xmath161 where @xmath162    now , @xmath163 is small by assumption . if we estimate @xmath143 as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the order of the ambipolar diffusion velocity at the center of the the disk , then @xmath166 , so that @xmath53 is much smaller than the distance an alfven wave can propagate in the ion - neutral collision time .",
    "this is clearly a microscopic distance compared to the thickness of the disk , so that we may neglect it .    in summary ,",
    "equation  [ eq:50 ] implies that the inner solution essentially vanishes at @xmath167 , so that we may take our boundary condition to be @xmath168 at @xmath169 .",
    "given this solution the above analysis shows how to smoothly continue it into the halo .",
    "equation  [ eq:17 ] and equation  [ eq:18 ] can be made dimensionless by a proper transformation .",
    "we choose a transformation that is consistent with that employed in the next section .",
    "define a unit of time @xmath170 by @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the radius of the sun s galactic orbit , and @xmath173 is its angular velocity .",

    "now , let @xmath176    for a cloud ion density of @xmath177 , and a mean interstellar medium density of @xmath178 , ( see section 5 ) . also , @xmath179 parsecs , and @xmath180 years .",
    "the hubble time in these dimensionless units is about 3 .",
    "the details of the numerical simulation are given in another paper , ( howard , 1996 ) .",
    "the dimensionless equations to be solved are @xmath181 @xmath182 our dimensionless boundary condition is @xmath183 at @xmath184 .",
    "the results of the integration of these equations are shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "the initial profiles of @xmath72 and @xmath43 are parabolic .    in figure 5",
    "the initial value of @xmath185 is @xmath186 , so that @xmath187 gauss .",
    "it is seen that the qualitative behavior is the same as that described in sections 1 and 2 .",
    "the field at first grows and then relaxes back to a decaying solution .",
    "figure 6 gives the time evolution of @xmath188 at @xmath189 for the set of initial conditions , @xmath190 where @xmath50 runs from zero to one hundred eight degrees in increments of fifteen degrees .",
    "it is seen that the curves all tend to the same asymptotic behavior and are similar to those in figure 2 . as in figure 2",
    ", the field from weaker initial values of @xmath72 takes longer times to reach its peak value and the saturation curve .",
    "these results are similar to those which are represented by equations 28 and 29 .",
    "it is seen in figure 5 that , except near the edge , the profile remains similar to a parabola .",
    "near the edge the cube root behavior of equation  [ eq:51 ] is also evident .",
    "this cube root behavior can be understood since the flux @xmath191 is roughly constant , and therefore @xmath192 a constant .",
    "the most important feature in figure 5 and 6 , is the saturation of @xmath29 to the envelope curve .",
    "this saturation occurs if the initial value of @xmath193 is larger than 0.01 .",
    "thus , even in our more precise calculations , information on the initial b is lost , and the final value of @xmath29 at fixed time depends only on the initial sign of @xmath72 .",
    "in the last section we have treated the evolution of the magnetic field under the influence of differential rotation and ambipolar diffusion in a one dimensional approximation .",
    "only the @xmath20 component of the ambipolar diffusion was kept . in this approximation the magnetic field in each column of fluid at @xmath194 evolves independently of any other @xmath195 column of fluid .    in early times , because the galactic disk is thin compared to its radius , this is a good approximation , since the horizontal gradients of @xmath196 are small compared to the vertical gradients . however , because of the differential rotation of the galaxy , fluid elements at different radii , that were initially very far from each other are brought much closer together , and the horizontal gradients are increased until they become comparable to the vertical gradients .    for example , two fluid elements that were initially on opposite sides of the galaxy , and at a difference in radius of one hundred parsecs , will be brought to a position on the same radius after about fifty rotations . since the evolution of the field in these two fluid elements is very different , we expect the gradient of @xmath196 in the radial direction to become as large as that in the vertical direction . as a consequence ,",
    "ambipolar drift velocities in the horizontal direction can be expected to be as large as those in the vertical direction . on the other hand , two fluid elements at the same radius , but initially far apart , remain far apart .",
    "the ambipolar motions in the @xmath50 direction should remain small .",
    "thus , we expect that , at first , only ambipolar @xmath20 motions are important for the evolution of the magnetic field , but that eventually the radial ambipolar motions also will become important , although not the angular ambipolar motions .",
    "that is , we expect the problem to become two dimensional .    in order to properly demonstrate this evolution , we introduce a new independent variable @xmath197 if ambipolar diffusion is neglected , this variable is just the initial angular position of a fluid element that is at the position @xmath198 at time @xmath21 . since in the absence of ambipolar diffusion",
    "the variables @xmath199 and @xmath20 are constant , following a given fluid element",
    ". they would be the lagrangian variables if only rotational motion is considered .",
    "it is appropriate to describe the evolution of the magnetic field components @xmath200 , and @xmath117 in terms of these variables",
    ".    inspection of equation  [ ueq ] shows that when @xmath97 is large , @xmath201 varies rapidly with @xmath42 at fixed @xmath50 , in agreement with the above qualitative discussion .",
    "changing @xmath42 by only a small amount will change the initial angular position by @xmath202 .",
    "thus , we expect that the components of @xmath203 will vary finitely with @xmath201 , but only slowly with @xmath42 for fixed @xmath201 .",
    "the surfaces of constant @xmath201 are tightly wrapped spirals .",
    "thus , the behavior of the field should be finite in @xmath199 and @xmath20 , but only gradients with respect to @xmath201 and @xmath20 should be important .    to see this , let us first write the total velocity , @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the ambipolar velocity .",
    "next , let us derive the equations for the components @xmath206 and @xmath207 in terms of the eulerian variables @xmath194 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath208 @xmath209 @xmath210 where the ambipolar velocities are : @xmath211 and @xmath212 finally , let us transform these equations to the new coordinates @xmath213 .",
    "in doing this we assume that the galactic rotation velocity @xmath214 is a constant .",
    "the result of the transformation is @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath218 @xmath219 @xmath220    only a few of these terms are important . to see this",
    "let us introduce dimensionless variables for the velocity and field components .",
    "( we will denote the dimensionless variables by primes . )",
    "we will choose these variables based on our one - dimensional results , as follows :    the unit of length for the @xmath20 variable is the galactic disk thickness @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath221 the variation of quantities with @xmath222 is finite over the distance @xmath172 the radius of the sun s orbit in the galaxy , so we set @xmath223 the variable @xmath201 is already dimensionless and quantities vary finitely with it , so we leave it unchanged .",
    "the unit of time @xmath170 should be of order of the age of the disk . during this time",
    "the number of radians through which the galaxy rotates , @xmath97 is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio @xmath224 , so for analytic convenience we choose @xmath170 so that @xmath225 and set @xmath226 if we take @xmath227 , and @xmath228 then @xmath229 years .",
    "it is natural to choose the unit for @xmath230 as that field whose @xmath20 gradient produces an ambipolar @xmath20 velocity of order @xmath231 , that is an average velocity near that which would be produced by the saturated field .",
    "thus , we choose @xmath174 so that @xmath232 and set @xmath233 ( note that the definitions in these units are consistent with those of section 3 . )    in most cases of interest to us , @xmath234 and @xmath117 are much smaller than @xmath174 .",
    "( in general @xmath43 is initially small compared to @xmath174 , but it grows by a factor of @xmath224 to up to the saturated value of about @xmath174 . )",
    "thus , we set @xmath235 the vertical field @xmath117 starts out even weaker than this magnitude since the initial horizontal components of the magnetic field were amplified by the initial compression which formed the disk .",
    "however , the @xmath117 field is amplified up to the size of the @xmath234 field by the shear of the radial ambipolar velocity acting on @xmath72 .",
    "we thus transform @xmath117 by @xmath236    the ambipolar velocities @xmath237 , and @xmath238 arise from gradients of the magnetic field in the corresponding directions .",
    "thus , after @xmath43 has been amplified by stretching to be of order @xmath239 .",
    "similarly , after the differential rotation has acted to reduce the scale of the variation of @xmath196 in the radial direction , @xmath240 becomes of order @xmath238 .",
    "however , the scale of variation in the @xmath50 direction remains of order @xmath172 over the age of the galaxy so that @xmath241 .",
    "thus , we change the @xmath242 components to @xmath243 components by @xmath244    now if we transform equations 64 to 69 by the change of variables equations 70 to 78 , and clear the dimensional factors @xmath245 etc .",
    "from the left hand side , we find that the terms on the right hand side are either independent of dimensional units entirely , or are proportional to powers of @xmath246 .",
    "the full equations are given in appendix b. dropping these `` smaller '' terms proportional to a power of @xmath247 greater than zero , we find that the equations for the dimensionless variables , to lowest order in d / r are @xmath248 @xmath249 @xmath250 @xmath251 @xmath252 @xmath253    note that @xmath254 does not occur in the equations for the evolution of the @xmath255 components . also , the @xmath256 derivatives are absent from these lower order equations .",
    "the initial conditions on @xmath257 are @xmath258    these transformations are formal , but they enable us to correctly drop the terms whose effect is small .",
    "once these terms are dropped , the equations reduce to two dimensional equations , which are more easily handled numerically .",
    "although we have assumed that the dimensionless variables are originally of order unity , it may be the case that they differ substantially from unity .",
    "however , an examination of the various possible relevant cases leads to the conviction that all the important terms have been kept as well as other terms which are , perhaps , unimportant .",
    "for example , the initial value of @xmath259 is much smaller than unity .",
    "however , because of the shearing terms in equation 80 ( the last term ) @xmath259 grows to finite order when @xmath260 becomes of order unity , so during the later stages of the galactic disk , @xmath259 is of order unity .",
    "many of the terms in equations 79 to 81 have an obvious significance .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of the @xmath259 equation is the vertical decompression term present in the one dimensional simulation .",
    "the first term is the radial decompression term , which only becomes important when @xmath261 , and the wrapping up has made the radial ambipolar diffusion important .    similarly , there is a @xmath20 decompressional term in the @xmath262 equation , but , of course , no radial decompression term .",
    "there is a term representing the effect of shear on the toroidal field in increasing the radial component , and a similar term resulting from the action of shear on the @xmath263 component .",
    "these shear terms would be small if @xmath264 were of order of @xmath72 , or if @xmath117 were much smaller than @xmath72 , which is the case initially .",
    "however , @xmath117 is increased by shear terms over the age of the disk , to a value considerably larger than its initial value .",
    "equations 79 to 84 only contain derivatives with respect to @xmath265 and @xmath201 , and none with respect to @xmath256 .",
    "thus , @xmath256 is only a parameter in these differential equations .",
    "therefore , the components of the magnetic field evolve independently of those at a different value of @xmath256 ( to lowest order in @xmath247 ) .",
    "further , @xmath201 does not occur explicitly in the differential equations .",
    "the initial conditions , equations 85 do involve @xmath201 , and are periodic in it .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field components remain periodic in @xmath201 for all @xmath260 .",
    "let us consider the behavior of such a solution , periodic in @xmath266 , in the neighborhood of the sun , @xmath267 , at fixed @xmath268 , say @xmath269 .",
    "transform the solution back to @xmath194 coordinates . for fixed",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath21 , the solution is periodic in @xmath270 e.g. @xmath271 .",
    "moreover , for fixed @xmath50 we can write @xmath272 so @xmath273    thus , for fixed @xmath274 changes by an amount @xmath275 when @xmath201 changes by its periodic length @xmath276 . since @xmath256 changes by a small amount @xmath277",
    ", we may ignore the dependence of the solution for the components of @xmath278 on @xmath256 and the components of @xmath279 are nearly periodic in @xmath42 ( at fixed @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , because of the actual dependence of the solution on @xmath256 , as a parameter in the equations , the amplitude and phase ( as well as the shape ) of the periodic solution do change slowly when one goes a distance comparable with the radius of the galaxy .    equations 79 to 84 were integrated numerically .",
    "the details of the integration are discussed in howard(1995 , 1996 ) , where most of the results are presented .",
    "initial conditions were set by starting with a cosmic field before compression into the disk , and then calculating the resultant fields . in this paper",
    "we present the results for two initial cases .",
    "only the results for the integrations at @xmath280 , the radius of the galactic solar orbit , are included .",
    "the variation of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath201 , at @xmath189 , is plotted in figure 7 for the case that the initial cosmic field was uniform .",
    "the antisymmetry in @xmath201 is evident , and it is clear , after transforming the field to be a function of @xmath42 as the independent variable by equation 87 , that no faraday rotation would be produced by this field . the same result for the case when the initial cosmic field was nonuniform is shown in figure 8 .",
    "[ the initial cosmic field was chosen so after compression into the disk the horizontal field was @xmath281 . ]",
    "the resulting saturated field is not antisymmetric , and does not average out in @xmath201 .",
    "it also would not average out when transformed to be a function of @xmath42 , and _ would _ produce a faraday rotation .",
    "the variation of @xmath43 with @xmath20 at @xmath282 at a time of 9 gigayears , is shown in figure 9 .",
    "it has the parabolic shape found in section 3 .",
    "the variation of @xmath43 with time at the point @xmath283 , is given in figure 10 for the two cases .",
    "the results are also similar to those of figure 2 derived from the simple parabolic approximation .",
    "we now consider the averaged equations for the magnetic field , taking into account the interstellar clouds .",
    "the bulk of interstellar matter is in the form of diffuse clouds and molecular clouds .",
    "because the properties of the molecular clouds are not very well known , we make the simplifying assumption that essentially all the interstellar matter is in diffuse clouds , with a small amount of matter in the intercloud region . in describing the clouds , we make use of properties given by spitzer(1968 ) .",
    "we assume that all the clouds are identical .",
    "we further include the cosmic ray pressure , and the magnetic pressure , in the intercloud region , but neglect the pressure of the intercloud matter",
    ". then the cosmic rays and the magnetic fields are held in the disk against their outward pressures by the weight of the clouds in the gravitational field of the stars .",
    "( see figure 3 . )    now the force due to the magnetic and cosmic ray pressure gradients is exerted only on the ionized matter in the clouds , while the gravitational force is exerted mainly on the neutrals in the clouds , since the fraction of ionization in the clouds is generally very low .",
    "thus , these contrary forces pull the ions through the neutrals with ambipolar diffusion velocity @xmath23 .",
    "the frictional force between the ions and neutrals is proportional to @xmath23 . by equating the magnetic plus the cosmic ray force to the frictional force",
    ", we can obtain the mean ambipolar velocity in the clouds .",
    "now , we assume that the cosmic ray pressure @xmath284 is related to the magnetic pressure @xmath285 by the factor @xmath32(spitzer 1968 ) .",
    "we take @xmath32 independent of time and space .",
    "this is plausible since when the magnetic field is strong , we expect the cosmic ray confinement to be better and therefore the cosmic ray pressure to be larger .",
    "the mean vertical force per unit volume produced by the magnetic field strength gradients and cosmic ray pressure gradients is @xmath286 but this force is counterbalanced by the gravitational force on neutrals in the clouds , which occupy a fractional volume equal to the filling factor , @xmath31 , times the total volume .",
    "thus , the force per unit volume on the ions in the clouds is @xmath287 this force produces an ambipolar velocity , @xmath23 , of the ions relative to the neutrals such that @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the mean ion mass , @xmath27 is the effective ion ",
    "neutral collision rate for momentum transfer and @xmath109 is the ion number density , in the clouds .",
    "now , @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the momentum transfer collision cross section , and we assume that the neutrals are all hydrogen with atomic mass @xmath292 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath293    if @xmath294 , then the mass factor is @xmath292 .",
    "hence , if the ions are mostly singly charged carbon , the mass factor is @xmath295 , while if they are mostly hydrogen ions then it is @xmath296 .",
    "the ions are tied to the magnetic field lines , since the plasma is effectively infinitely conducting .",
    "if there are several species of ions , they all have the same cross field ambipolar velocity .",
    "thus , the ambipolar diffusion velocity in the clouds is @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the effective mass averaged over ion species , and @xmath291 is the ion ",
    "neutral cross section .",
    "the velocity @xmath23 is the mean velocity of an ion inside a cloud .",
    "it is also the velocity of a given line of force .",
    "now , the ions are continually recombining and being replaced by other ions , so it is actually the motion of the magnetic lines of force that has significance .",
    "further , the clouds themselves have a short life compared to the age of the disk",
    ". they collide with other clouds every @xmath299 years or so , and then quickly reform .",
    "after the collision the cloud material is dispersed , but because of its high conductivity , it stays connected to the same lines of force . after the cloud reforms the lines of force are still connected to the same mass .",
    "the lines then continue to move in the reformed cloud , again in the opposite direction to the field gradient . as a consequence , during each cloud lifetime ,",
    "the lines of force pass through a certain amount of mass before the cloud is destroyed .",
    "the amount of mass passed during a cloud life time , by a single flux tube of diameter @xmath300 is @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the cloud life time , @xmath303 is the cloud diameter , and @xmath304 is the cloud density .",
    "because of our assumption that the bulk of the matter is in these diffuse clouds , it must be the case that there is only a short time in between the destruction of one cloud , and its reformation .",
    "thus , during a time @xmath21 , the field passes through @xmath305 successive clouds .",
    "if we consider a length of a line of force @xmath306 , at any one time it passes through @xmath307 different clouds . then",
    ", in the time @xmath21 , the amount of matter passed by this length of a given tube of force ( of diameter @xmath308 ) is @xmath309 but @xmath310 , is the mean density , @xmath311 , of interstellar matter .",
    "thus , if we define @xmath312 as the average effective distance that this magnetic tube moves through the disk by @xmath313 we get @xmath314 or @xmath315    this effective _ velocity _ , averaged over many cloud lifetimes , is the only velocity for the magnetic field lines that makes sense .",
    "it is equal to the velocity , @xmath23 , of the ions in the cloud material .",
    "so far , we have made the simplifying assumption that the clouds are stationary , which is of course not the case .",
    "as the clouds move through the interstellar medium they stretch the lines , and additional tension forces and ambipolar velocities arise .",
    "however , these velocities are always directed toward the mean position of the cloud material , and thus they tend to average to zero .",
    "the ambipolar velocity which we have calculated above , under the assumption of stationary clouds , actually gives the rate of displacement of the lines of force relative to the mean position of the cloud .",
    "it is a secular velocity , and it is the only velocity which really counts .",
    "we assume that in the diffuse interstellar clouds only carbon is ionized , so that @xmath316 .",
    "we choose @xmath317(spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "if the filling factor of the clouds @xmath318 , and if the mean interstellar density of hydrogen is @xmath319 , then the density in the clouds is @xmath320 . the cosmic abundance of carbon is @xmath321(allen 1963 ) .",
    "we assume that this abundance is depleted by @xmath322 , ( spitzer 1978 ) , the rest of the carbon being locked up in grains .",
    "we further take @xmath323 .",
    "then comparing equation  [ eq:40 ] with equation  [ eq:93 ] gives @xmath324 in cgs units .",
    "taking @xmath325 pc , we get from equation  [ eq:54 ] @xmath326    we take @xmath180 years . we see that if @xmath327 , corresponding to an age for the galactic disk of @xmath328 years , then the present value of the magnetic field from figure 8 , should be @xmath329 gauss .",
    "this value depends on our assumptions concerning the properties of the clouds .",
    "in particular , if the hydrogen in the interstellar clouds is partly ionized by low energy cosmic rays penetrating the clouds , then the ambipolar diffusion will be slower , and @xmath330 will be smaller , leading to a larger value for @xmath174 .",
    "the consequence of this is , that the initially dimensionless magnetic field @xmath185 will be smaller , so that it would take longer to reach saturation .",
    "however , the saturated value will be larger .",
    "we have assumed that there was a cosmic magnetic field present before the galaxy formed . on the basis of this hypothesis we have constructed a simplified model of the galactic disk in order to investigate how the magnetic field would evolve , and what it would look like at present .",
    "the two essential ingredients of this model are : the differential rotation of the interstellar medium , and the motion of the field lines through the interstellar medium produced by the ambipolar diffusion of the ionized component of the plasma driven through the neutrals by magnetic pressure and cosmic ray pressure gradients .",
    "the effect of turbulent motions is assumed to average out .",
    "no large scale mean field dynamo action on the magnetic field was included in this model .",
    "( this model differs from that of piddington in that the magnetic field is too weak to effect the galactic rotation of the interstellar medium , and also , ambipolar diffusion is included . )",
    "the consequences of the model were investigated by an approximate analytical calculation in section 2 , and by more detailed numerical simulations in section 3 and 4 .",
    "these simulations confirmed the results of the approximate analysis of section 2 .",
    "the basic results are :    \\(1 ) to first approximation , the magnetic field evolves locally following a rotating fluid element .",
    "it first grows by stretching the radial component of the magnetic field into the toroidal direction .",
    "when the field becomes strong enough , the line commences to shorten because of the vertical motions produced by ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this reduces the radial component , and therefore the stretching . after a certain time , the field strength saturates and starts to decrease as the reciprocal square root of time .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is determined only by the ambipolar diffusion properties of the clouds .",
    "thus , the field strength everywhere approaches the same value at a given time . at the present time , this value is estimated to be in the range of a few microgauss .",
    "this saturated value is independent of the initial value which the field had when the disk first formed , provided that the initial value of the field strength is greater than @xmath331 gauss .",
    "the extent of each magnetic field line in the toroidal direction also saturates , but its length in the disk _ does _ depend on the initial value .",
    "\\(2 ) the direction of the toroidal field in any given fluid element depends on the sign of the initial radial component .",
    "since this sign varies with position , and since differential rotation mixes these positions , it turns out that the resulting toroidal field varies rapidly with radius along a fixed radial direction . the toroidal field changes direction on a scale of a hundred parsecs .",
    "because the saturated field strength is nearly constant in magnitude , the toroidal field strength as a function of @xmath332 at fixed @xmath50 varies as a square wave .",
    "however , the lobes of this square wave need not be equal since the regions of one initial sign of @xmath72 may be larger than those of the other sign . in this case , the model predicts a toroidal field that would produce a net faraday rotation in radio sources such as pulsars or polarized extragalactic radio sources , in spite of its rapid variation in sign .",
    "it is the prevailing belief that the galactic magnetic field does not reverse in radius on small scales .",
    "in fact , this belief is grounded in an analysis of faraday rotation measures of pulsars(hamilton and lynn 1987 ) . in analyzing these rotation measure rand and kulkarni(1988 ) employed various simple models of the galactic field . in every one of these models , the magnetic field reversed only on large scales of order one kiloparsec .",
    "these models , which only allowed a slow variation of @xmath29 , led to results that were consistent with the observations , and thus supported the general belief in reversal only on large scales .",
    "however , when this analysis was carried out , there was no apparent reason reason not to consider a model in which the field varied rapidly in radius on scales of order of a hundred parsecs , although in hindsight it could have been done . however , such a model was not included in the analysis of the rotation measures , and thus it was not tested . therefore , at present , there is no reason to exclude such a model .    in short ,",
    "the prevailing belief that the galactic magnetic field is of constant sign on a large scale , actually resulted from the assumption that the field was a large scale field , and from the consistency of this assumed model with observations .",
    "therefore , this conclusion has not been rigorously demonstrated . a magnetic field , such as that arrived at from our model , which has the rapid variation of the field with radius , would lead to fluctuations from the mean .",
    "indeed , such fluctuations are in the data and are attributed to a general isotropic random magnetic field in addition to the mean field .",
    "we feel the the non uniform square wave could probably fit the observations equally as well as the other models , so that our model can also be shown to be consistent with observations .",
    "we have not yet demonstrated quantitative consistency with observations , but we hope to carry out this task in the future .",
    "\\(3 ) the magnetic field observed in our galaxy and in other galaxies should actually be the average of the true detailed magnetic field averaged over regions in space larger than those regions over which we find our field to vary ( several hundred parsecs at least ) .",
    "thus , under averaging the field of our model would actually appear as an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field .",
    "an analysis of the various galactic magnetic fields has made the _ ansatz _ that the origin of the field can be distinguished as primordial if it has bisymmetric symmetry , and as due to a dynamo if it has axisymmetry(sofue et al .",
    "( it must be borne in mind that the actual magnetic field is perturbed by the spiral arms , so that it is parallel to the arms in the region of the spiral arms and toroidal in the region in between the arms as described in the introduction . ) on the basis of our analysis , we conclude that this method of distinguishing the origin is not valid , and could lead to incorrect conclusions concerning the origin of the galactic magnetic fields .    \\4 .",
    "parker(1968 , 1973a , b ) and others(ruzmaikin et al 1988 ) have put forth three objections to a primordial origin .",
    "these objections are : ( a ) a primordial field would be tightly wrapped up , contrary to observations .",
    "( b ) such a field would be expelled by ambipolar diffusion or turbulent diffusion .",
    "( c ) there is no known mechanism to produce a large scale primordial field in the early universe .    on the basis of our model",
    "we can counter the first two objections ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "our model does indeed lead to a tightly wrapped spiral magnetic field .",
    "however , when averaged over a sufficiently large scale , as is done automatically by observations , the resulting field should actually appear to be axisymmetric and azimuthal .",
    "this averaged field is , thus , not in disagreement with observations . in addition , if the large scale field is not uniform , then the field after saturation by ambipolar diffusion creates larger regions of one sign then of the other sign and the averaged field is not zero .",
    "thus , objection ( a ) does not defeat our model for a field of primordial origin .",
    "with respect to objection ( b ) our model predicts field lines which thread through the disk , entering on one edge and leaving on the other .",
    "thus , it is impossible for a vertical ambipolar motion or turbulent mixing to expel lines of force .",
    "this result counters objection ( b ) .",
    "the third objection is still open to debate and we do not discuss it .",
    "the two observations that should test our model are : the magnetic field in other galaxies should be observed to be toroidal in between the arms .",
    "a reanalysis of the pulsar rotation measures should fit our model without very large extra fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations should be accounted for by the rapid reversals of the toroidal field predicted by our model .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that a careful analysis of the evolution of a primordial field throws new light on the way one should view the primordial field hypothesis .",

    "these pressures lead to a    upward force on the neutrals in the cloud .",

    "the action of these two forces    produces a motion of the ions through the cloud , ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the right hand end of the line is connected to the external cosmos .",
