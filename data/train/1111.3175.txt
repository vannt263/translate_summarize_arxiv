    "the experiments involving solar , reactor , atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos have established a picture of neutrino oscillations caused by non - zero neutrino masses and mixing among different neutrino flavors ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations arising from the mismatch between the weak and the mass eigenstates can be described by the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "this matrix can be parametrized in various ways as seen in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all experimental data except those from the lsnd  @xcite can be well described assuming three active neutrinos . in the case of dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the @xmath5 unitary mixing matrix is characterized by three euler angles and one physical phase , and can be expressed as a product of three rotation matrices .",
    "the physical phase can be responsible for cp violation in the neutrino sector . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cp - violating phase can be associated with the sine or cosine of any mixing angle or with the identity entry in any of the three rotation matrices . in this work",
    ", we will follow the standard cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite for the assignment of the cp - violating phase .",
    "define @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mixing angles and the cp - violating phase , respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . as the combination @xmath15 is the standard choice for describing the quark mixing , it has been adopted to be the conventional parametrization for the mixing matrix for dirac neutrinos .",
    "this choice of the parametrization was actually made prior to the era when neutrino oscillation data became available .",
    "later , the solar neutrino experiments  @xcite , reactor  @xcite , long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator  @xcite , as well as the atmospheric neutrino experiments  @xcite all choose this parametrization to present their results .",
    "using existing global neutrino data , most phenomenology works  @xcite also employ this parametrization to determine neutrino oscillation parameters .    in the conventional parametrization",
    ", the three mixing angles happen to nearly decouple for solar , atmospheric / accelerator , and reactor neutrino oscillation experiments due to the different neutrino energies and traveling distances involved .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 angles are well determined by solar and atmospheric experiments , respectively .",
    "current - generation short - baseline reactor experiments such as the daya bay  @xcite , double chooz  @xcite , reno  @xcite and the angra  @xcite experiments are exploited to pin down the yet unknown @xmath18 value .",

    "@xcite for a nice compilation of existing model predictions ) , and supported by global neutrino data analyses ( see e.g. ref  @xcite and this work ) .",
    "very recently , the double chooz experiment  @xcite has reported their preliminary results of @xmath19 ( 68@xmath20 cl ) . when this is confirmed in the future by other experiments with even better sensitivities , it will be good news for near - future experiments such as t2k  @xcite , no@xmath21a  @xcite , t2hk  @xcite , t2kk  @xcite .",
    "their goal of measuring the cp - violating effect will be more reachable .",
    "this is not the end of the story for the neutrino oscillation community .",
    "another issue is the determination of the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "as we enter the era of precision neutrino oscillation experiments , terms linear in @xmath1 may no longer be negligible in fitting the mixing angles . from the jarlskog invariant quantity  @xcite of cp violation",
    ", one sees that the sign of @xmath1 would also have an impact on the @xmath12 determination . however , in the conventional parametrization , the reactor and solar experiments are only sensitive to @xmath0 . for lbl accelerator or atmospheric experiments ,",

    "faces when working in the conventional parametrization , a first attempt to determine the sign of @xmath1 has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite using the lbl accelerator , chooz , and atmospheric neutrino data .    in fact",
    "the conventional parametrization is not the only way to establish the mixing matrix .",
    "as proposed by several authors  @xcite , the corresponding mixing parameters may be more accessible , without sacrificing accuracy , in other parametrizations . in this work",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to explore this possibility .",
    "besides the conventional parametrization , we perform a global neutrino oscillation analysis adopting an alternative parametrization , @xmath22 , in which the observables have leading terms linear in any of the three mixing angles .",
    "equipped with the analysis results obtained in these two parametrizations , we will be eligible to address a couple of issues .",
    "can one determine the sign of @xmath2 ?",
    "are there other parametrizations which can provide comparable sensitivities in extracting neutrino oscillation parameters as the conventional one ?",
    "how are the three mixing angles correlated with each other therein ?",
    "do the matter ( msw ) effects  @xcite affect the sign of @xmath2 ?",
