    "the decay of unstable states into a continuum is commonplace in many areas of physics , ranging from quantum physics @xcite to statistical mechanics @xcite , atomic and molecular physics @xcite , optics @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "while an exponential decay is ubiquitous in nature , quantum mechanics dictates that the decay law should deviate from an exponential one at short and long time scales .",
    "such deviations may lead to deep physical implications .",
    "short - time deviations of the decay process have been observed in experiments on macroscopic quantum tunneling of cold atoms @xcite and have attracted a considerable interest because of the possibility to either decelerate ( zeno effect ) or accelerate ( anti - zeno effect ) the decay by frequent observations of the system @xcite . at long time scales the quantum mechanical decay slows down and shows a power - law decay @xcite .",
    "slowing down the decay process may have major implications in cosmological models @xcite , for example it may increase the likelihood of eternal inflation .",
    "in many particle systems , the decay dynamics can be modified by particle statistics and contact interactions @xcite .",
    "recent experiments demonstrated the role of pauli exclusion principle @xcite and interaction - induced particle correlations @xcite .",
    "in such previous studies , quantum mechanical decay has been mostly considered in the framework of standard quantum mechanics , which sets the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the full system to be an hermitian operator .",
    "recently , an increasing interest has been devoted to investigate the dynamics of non - hermitian quantum and classical systems @xcite , especially those possessing parity - time ( @xmath4 symmetry @xcite .",
    "such systems find important applications in several areas of physics .",
    "for example , effective non - hermitian hamiltonians are often introduced in the description of open quantum systems . in optics ,",
    "non - hermitian and @xmath5-symmetric dynamics can be exploited to the design of integrated photonic devices with novel functionalities @xcite .",
    "such studies motivate to extend the standard quantum mechanical description of the decay process to the non - hermitian case , where the non - unitary dynamics is expected to modify the decay process or to induce an unstable growth ( rather than decay ) when the energy spectrum shows energies with positive imaginary part .",
    "recent studies have considered the decay problem of discrete states with complex energies coupled to an hermitian continuum , predicting the existence of bound states either outside or embedded into the continuum @xcite .",
    "however , the more general case of the decay into a _ non - hermitian continuum _ has been so far overlooked .",
    "noteworthy examples of non - hermitian continua are provided by so - called complex crystals , i.e. periodic complex potentials , which can be experimentally implemented in optics and in cold atom systems @xcite .",
    "complex crystals have recently attracted a great attention because of their rather unique scattering properties , such as the ability to appear invisible when probed on one side @xcite , to realize talbot self - imaging @xcite and to show a giant goos - hnchen shift @xcite .    in this work",
    "we theoretically investigate the decay dynamics of a hermitian bound state of ( real ) energy @xmath6 weakly coupled to a tight - binding _ non - hermitian _ continuum [ fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "the non - hermitian continuum is realized by a tight - binding ( single - band ) crystal with a complex energy dispersion curve @xmath7 , that describes a closed loop @xmath8 in the complex energy plane when the bloch wave number @xmath9 spans the brillouin zone .",

    "such a rule can fail in very special cases , corresponding to the existence of bound states embedded in the continuum .",
    "what happens when the discrete state of energy @xmath6 is weakly coupled to an unstable non - hermitian tight - binding continuum ?",
    "as we will show in the present work , a richer scenario can be found , mainly depending on the instability properties of the continuum .",
    "for a so - called _ convectively - unstable _ continuum @xcite , complete quantum decay can persist in spite of energy states with positive imaginary part in the continuum , however contrary to the hermitian case incomplete ( fractional ) decay can be found even when the energy @xmath6 is embedded into the continuum , i.e. @xmath6 falls inside the loop @xmath8 . for an _ absolutely - unstable _ continuum @xcite , a secular growth ( rather than decay )",
    "is observed , however contrary to a naive prediction the amplification is not purely exponential , rather it is pseudo exponential .",
    "the general analysis is exemplified by considering a nearest - neighboring tight - binding continuum with asymmetric hopping rates , which is described by the dispersion relation @xmath13 .",
    "the continuum is convectively unstable for @xmath14 , whereas it is absolutely unstable for @xmath15 . in the former case",
    "it is shown that the quantum decay dynamics is pseudo - hermitian , i.e. it can be reduced to the one of an equivalent hermitian hamiltonian via an imaginary gauge transformation , whereas in the latter case the dynamics is non - hermitian in its essence and a pseudo exponential secular growth is observed .",
