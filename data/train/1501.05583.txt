    "there is rising interest in the physics potential of a future higher energy hadron collider which might begin running sometime after the high luminosity lhc program is completed .",
    "such a machine , here generically termed the fhc , has been discussed in various manifestations at a growing number of workshops@xcite but generally is expected to operate in the @xmath7 tev energy range .",
    "the goal of such a machine will be to explore the unknown , , to search for new physics ( np ) , both beyond the standard model ( sm ) and beyond the reach of the lhc , that might be kinematically accessible at these higher collision energies . as such , it s",
    "np search capabilities should be as strong as possible , and in particular be at least as powerful as those we expect to be available at the 14 tev lhc .",
    "this np may take several forms : it may be relatively light but very weakly coupled to the sm so that the the increased cross sections at a higher energy collider will allow access .",
    "more commonly , we imagine this np to manifest as some new , very heavy state(s ) that are simply too massive to be produced at the 14 tev lhc ; this is the case we will consider below .",
    "searches for np can be quite complex , generally involving sophisticated experimental analyses in order to extract a significant signal above some sm background .",
    "this makes quantifying the power of a future collider difficult without a detailed study of a wide range of potential np physics scenarios .",
    "depending on what kind of np one is interested in various possibilities come to mind . here ,",
    "as said above , we are essentially only interested in np which is quite heavy .",
    "perhaps in this case a crude but simple measure of this potential discovery power is obtainable by employing the value of the _ relative _ mass reach for np associated with a heavy mass scale @xmath0 , , the value of the mass reach scaled to the collision energy , @xmath1 .",
    "for example , this would mean that if a new 3.5 tev state is discoverable with some fixed number of signal events at the 14 tev lhc then the corresponding 25 tev state should be discoverable at the 100 tev fhc with the same number of events .",
    "we can achieve this by requiring that as the @xmath2 increases the number of np events remains at ( or above ) the given fixed reference value . to accomplish this",
    "it is clear that the integrated luminosity , @xmath8 , of the collider must grow with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "richter has recently emphasized this issue@xcite and reminded us that in the scaling limit for the np cross section , @xmath9 , @xmath8 must grow as @xmath3 , the square of the collider center of mass energy .",
    "in such a limit , the relevant ratio of appropriately _ energy - scaled _",
    "cross sections is given by : @xmath10 which is defined for a _",
    "fixed _ value of the ratio @xmath1 and by a reference collision energy , @xmath11 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath12 is then simply unity in the scaling limit , by construction , reflecting the required luminosity growth as discussed above .",
    "of course we know that exact scaling is broken in the real world arising from a number of sources , , due to the evolution of the parton density functions ( pdfs ) and the running of the strong coupling , @xmath6 .",
    "( we note that the running of the other sm couplings , such as @xmath13 , while also producing a small scaling violation , will not play too large of a numerical role here . )",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath12 depends on @xmath2 even for fixed values of @xmath1 for any realistic np signal process .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss below , we will find that it is always true that both these sources of scaling violation will force @xmath14 for any @xmath15 tev .",
    "this subsequently implies that even greater increases in integrated luminosities will be required to maintain the same relative mass reach than what is suggested by the naive scaling argument made above .",
    "specifically , we will show that , roughly speaking , over the @xmath2 range of interest , the ratio @xmath12 scales as @xmath16 with @xmath17 , although this crude approximation breaks down over larger ranges of collision energy .",
    "thus instead of the the naive scaling of the needed luminosity @xmath18 , the actual luminosity scaling required to maintain the same relative mass reach is larger and is given approximately as @xmath19 .",
    "as we will see below , for some processes @xmath20 can be as large as @xmath21 which implies a significant increase in the value of the desired luminosity .",
    "thus the value of @xmath22 tells us the _ additional _ multiplicative factor that one needs to apply , beyond that obtained from simple scaling , in order to maintain the same relative mass reach as we increase @xmath2 .",
    "of course in actuality we will find that @xmath20 is only approximately constant in each case and it , itself , also increases slowly with @xmath2 .",
    "however , we will see that the larger the roles of @xmath6 and the gluon pdf are in the np production cross section the greater the value of @xmath20 and the larger the requited integrated luminosity will be to maintain the scaled mass reach will be .",
    "given these numerical results it will be the subject of further future studies to decide if the benefits of achieving this desired luminosity goal are worth the associated costs .",
    "note that in the discussion below we will not address in any great detail the issue of the consequences to the various np search reaches in the event that the corresponding integrated luminosity goals are not met at a future collider ; we will , however , providing several examples .",
    "from these few cases it would seem that the impact of falling short of these goals , while limiting , still results in an enormous gain in search reach .",
    "however , more detailed work needs to be performed to fully access this very important problem .",
    "these are not new issues ; discussions such as these took place over 30 years ago at the beginning of the ssc era@xcite .",
    "to begin this discussion it is useful to examine how the ratio @xmath12 is influenced purely by the evolution of the pdfs themselves . in order to be definitive , we will employ the recently available default 5-flavor nnlo mmht2014 set of pdfs@xcite as well as their corresponding default nnnlo running value of @xmath6 assuming that @xmath23 in the numerical analysis that appears below .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the results we obtain can be easily shown to be quite insensitive to these particular choices . in order to access these effects , we consider the standard integrated products of the parton densities , , the parton luminosities : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the relevant pdf , @xmath26 and with @xmath0 being identified with the partonic invariant mass at which the pdfs are evaluated . depending upon the nature of np ,",
    "different combinations of the pdfs are usually involved . here , to provide some specific examples we consider four sample cases : ( @xmath27 ) we perform a sum over @xmath28 pairs corresponding to the product of @xmath29 quarks and anti - quarks , denoted as @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 ) we instead sum over the corresponding products of @xmath32 quarks and anti - quarks , denoted as @xmath33 , ( @xmath34 ) the product of the gluon density with a sum over all the quark and anti - quark densities , denoted as @xmath35 , and lastly ( @xmath36 ) the product of two gluon densities , noted as @xmath37 .",
    "for each of these cases we fix the values of @xmath38 and then determine the corresponding ratios @xmath39 as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "these ratios are , of course , all unity in the scaling limit .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to which we now turn .     in comparison to those at @xmath40 tev .",
    "the dotted(solid , dashed , dash - dotted ) curves in all case corresponds to fixed values of @xmath41 . in the upper panel the red(blue ) curves",
    "corresponds to the @xmath42 cases , respectively , as discussed in the text . in the lower panel , the corresponding green(black )",
    "curves correspond to the cases @xmath37 and @xmath43 , as also discussed in the text , respectively.,width=480 ]     in comparison to those at @xmath40 tev .",
    "the dotted(solid , dashed , dash - dotted ) curves in all case corresponds to fixed values of @xmath41 . in the upper panel the red(blue ) curves corresponds to the @xmath42 cases , respectively , as discussed in the text . in the lower panel , the corresponding green(black )",
    "curves correspond to the cases @xmath37 and @xmath43 , as also discussed in the text , respectively.,width=480 ]    from the two panels in this figure we learn several important things : ( @xmath44 ) the ratio of luminosities in the range of interest scale roughly as @xmath45 with @xmath46 as expected from above which makes this dependence appear _ almost _ linear in these log - log plots .",
    "is generally distinct from the parameter @xmath20 introduced above . ]",
    "the particular value of @xmath47 depends upon the choice of the colliding partons as well as the specific choice of the value of @xmath38 .",
    "( @xmath48 ) in all cases we observe that as @xmath38 increases so does the value of the ` slope ' @xmath47 .",
    "( @xmath49 ) since the gluon pdf evolves more quickly than do the valence or sea quarks , the slopes in the @xmath37 case are seen to be greater than in the corresponding ones in the @xmath43 cases which are themselves greater than the corresponding ones observed in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 cases . in particular we see that in the @xmath37 case the luminosity ratio for @xmath52 falls off by a factor of @xmath53 as @xmath2 increases to 100 tev from 14 tev due to the @xmath54 evolution .",
    "this would mean that if _ only _ the pdfs mattered in the scale breaking then keeping the relative reach of @xmath52 for np fixed when going from 14 tev to 100 tev the luminosity would need to increase by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "( @xmath56 ) the @xmath50 combination is also seen to evolve somewhat more quickly with @xmath38 than does the corresponding @xmath51 pdf combination .",
    "of course , there are _ other _ sources of scaling violation which can potentially change the value of partonic slope @xmath47 to that of interest for a specific physical process , @xmath20 .    in a similar manner",
    "one can examine the magnitude of the effect of scaling violations from the running of @xmath57 , for fixed values of @xmath38 , by comparing its evolution as @xmath2 increases beyond 14 tev ; fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] shows this result .",
    "here we see that this evolution is ( very ) roughly constant for reasonable , yet fixed , values of @xmath38 . however , the slope is slightly less steep for larger @xmath38 values and some non - trivial curvature away from a straight line behavior is clearly visible .",
    "how much the running of @xmath6 will contribute to the overall scaling violation in a given process strongly depends upon the power in which it appears in the relevant subprocess cross sections , @xmath58 .",
    "in the cases we will examine below we have @xmath590 , 1 or 2 .    , for fixed @xmath38 , as a function of @xmath2 to that at 14 tev . from bottom to top the curves correspond to @xmath60 to 0.6 in steps of 0.1.,width=480 ]",
    "we now turn to an examination of how the production cross sections and mass reach associated with different specific benchmarks of np will scale as we increases @xmath2 beyond 14 tev along the lines discussed above by employing the ratio @xmath12 .",
    "this survey is not meant to be in any way exhaustive but only to be indicative of the possible range of the values of the ratio @xmath12 and to demonstrate what might be expected from going beyond the naive scaling arguments . based on the discussion above",
    "it is clear that the results we obtain will depend upon which subset of the pdfs are dominant and the role that @xmath6 plays in the relevant np production process , generally at lo , as nlo and higher order corrections will be sub - leading .",
    "we begin by considering the drell - yan production of the @xmath61 gauge boson in the sequential sm@xcite in the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) followed by its subsequent leptonic decay . in this case",
    "the @xmath6 corrections to both the cross section and leptonic branching fractions appear only at nlo ( but are included here ) and so the scaling behavior is expected to be dominated by that associated with the @xmath62- and @xmath63-type pdfs . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the scaled cross section ratio for this process assuming that @xmath64 or 0.5 .",
    "these values were chosen since the expected the reach for the ssm @xmath65 at the 14 tev lhc typically lies in the 5 - 7 tev range . indeed , the behavior of the ratio @xmath12 in this case is observed to generally follow that produced by a weighted combination of that for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 pdfs as we see by comparison with the top panel in fig .",
    "this means , , that the required luminosity to maintain the same value of the scaled search reach is only modestly larger than suggested by the scaling estimate .",
    "note that as expected @xmath12 behaves in all cases roughly as @xmath66 , , is almost linearly on this log - log plot .",
    "table  [ rates ] shows that the required integrated luminosity scaling for a @xmath67100 tev collider in comparison to the 14 tev lhc to be in the @xmath68 range for this process which is _ only _ @xmath69 larger that than implied by the scaling limit .",
    "interestingly , if we consider the @xmath5 tev collider as a specific example , it is easy to access the cost in the search reach for the @xmath65 if the ` required ' integrated luminosity goal is not reached .",
    "we find@xcite that for integrated luminosities in the 1 - 1000 ab@xmath70 range the discovery reach increases / decreases by @xmath71 tev for every factor of 10 of integrated luminosity gained or lost .",
    "the search reach is found to be @xmath72 tev assuming 10 ab@xmath70 is available so this is roughly a factor of @xmath73 for an order of magnitude change in luminosity .     of scaled cross sections defined in the text as functions of @xmath2 . here",
    "the dotted(solid , dashed ) green curves corresponds to values of @xmath74 for inclusive @xmath75 production followed by leptonic decay with @xmath76 .",
    "the blue(red ) curves are for inclusive heavy quark pair - production via @xmath77 ; in this case @xmath0 is identified with the heavy quark mass and the dotted(solid , dashed ) curves corresponds to values of @xmath78 , respectively.,width=480 ]    a second interesting example is provided by new heavy quark ( @xmath79 ) pair production which proceeds by @xmath80 fusion at lo .",
    "although the actual cross section for @xmath81 production is a pdf - weighted combination of these two contributions , it is interesting to consider both of these processes separately since they depend on different pdfs yet both occur at @xmath82 in lo .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the @xmath12 ratio for both of these processes assuming that @xmath83 corresponding to @xmath84 tev at the 14 tev lhc .",
    "here we see that @xmath12 falls much faster than do the corresponding relevant pdfs in either case due to the additional scaling violation associated with the running of the @xmath6 coupling .",
    "table  [ rates ] shows that in these cases the required integrated luminosity scaling for a @xmath67100 tev collider to be in the @xmath85 range for the @xmath86-initiated process and @xmath87 for the @xmath37-initiated process , which is expected to be dominant at large values of @xmath2 .",
    "if we roughly require 100 signal events at a @xmath5 tev collider as a benchmark signal rate for purposes of comparison ( note not for a discovery or to set a limit ) this corresponds to an heavy quark mass of @xmath88 tev for integrated luminosities of 1(10 , 100 , 1000 ) ab@xmath70 , respectively , which displays how the mass reach scales with luminosity variations in the interesting range .",

    "taking 100 events as a minimal search criterion as above then the mass reach is found to be @xmath107 tev assuming integrated luminosities of 1(10 , 100 , 1000 ) ab@xmath70 so that variations by a factor of 10 in integrated luminosity again produce a roughly @xmath102 change in the mass reach .",
    "a last example shown in fig  [ fig3 ] is that of single , resonant , excited quark ( @xmath108 ) ( with mass @xmath109 ) production in @xmath110-fusion@xcite which proceeds via an effective dimensional-5 operator with a cross section that is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "here we also require that the each of the jets from the decay of the @xmath108 satisfy @xmath111 to reduce the qcd backgrounds .",
    "explicitly , in the nwa one finds that in the case the partonic cross section behaves like @xmath112 times a product of the appropriate pdfs where @xmath113 is identified with the ` compositeness ' scale associated with the dim-5 operator .",
    "provided we keep both @xmath114 and @xmath115 fixed as @xmath2 increases , then in the scaling limit the ratio @xmath12 is again always unity . in the real world , since the cross section only involves a single power of the strong coupling and the relevant pdfs are of the @xmath43 type we expect @xmath12 to have an intermediate behavior between that observed for heavy quark production and that found for @xmath65 production and that is indeed the situation revealed in fig .",
    "here we assume that @xmath116 given the present 8 tev and the anticipated 14 tev lhc search reaches for excited quarks .",
    "table  [ rates ] shows that in this case the required integrated luminosity scaling for a @xmath67100 tev collider to be in the @xmath117 range for the heavy excited quark scenario .",
    "interestingly , if we require 100 signal events at a @xmath5 tev collider as a benchmark signal rate as well as @xmath118 for simplicity , this corresponds to an excited quark mass of 36.1(44.7 , 52.8 , 60.3 ) tev for integrated luminosities of 1(10 , 100 , 1000 ) ab@xmath70 which shows how the reach scales with luminosity in the region of interest .",
