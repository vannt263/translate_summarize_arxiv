    "fermion - pair production in  collisions is one of the basic processes of the standard model , and deviations of measured cross - sections from the predicted values could be a first indication of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "measurements up to 161  gev centre - of - mass energy  @xcite have shown no significant deviations from standard model expectations . in this paper",
    "we present new measurements of hadronic and leptonic final states in   collisions at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath50 of 172  gev , and improved results for the same final states at 130 , 136 , and 161  gev , using the opal detector at lep .",
    "cross - sections have been measured for hadronic , , , , and   final states , together with the forward - backward asymmetries for the leptonic final states .",
    "we present values both including and excluding the production of radiative @xmath1 events . in general",
    ", we define a ` non - radiative ' sample as events with @xmath51 , whereas ` inclusive ' measurements are corrected to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is defined as the centre - of - mass energy of the system after initial - state radiation .    in these analyses",
    ", we have introduced a well - defined treatment of the interference between initial- and final - state photon radiation , and an improved method of taking account of the contributions from four - fermion production .",
    "while both of these effects are small ( @xmath54 ) compared with the statistical precision of the current data , they will become significant with the increased luminosity expected at lep in the future , especially when combining results with other experiments  @xcite .",
    "we have reanalysed our data at 130136  gev  @xcite and 161  gev  @xcite using the same treatment of interference and four - fermion effects , in order to provide a uniform sample of measurements for comparison with standard model predictions .    the revised results at 130136  gev also benefit from several improvements to the analysis .",
    "in particular , we benefit from an improved understanding of the background in the inclusive hadronic samples arising from two - photon events . the separation of ` non - radiative ' hadronic events has been improved .",
    "the main changes to the lepton analyses include increased efficiency for the selection of tau pair events , and the use of a monte carlo generator with multiple photon emission for simulating the @xmath55 process instead of one containing only single photon production .",
    "there have also been improvements to the detector calibration , which particularly benefit the measurement of @xmath56 , the ratio of the cross - section for production to the hadronic cross - section .",
    "most of these improvements are already included in the published results at 161  gev  @xcite .",
    "as has been shown previously  @xcite , the comparable size of the photon exchange and  exchange amplitudes at these centre - of - mass energies allows constraints to be placed on the size of the interference terms between them . in this paper",
    "we improve our previous constraints by including the data at 172  gev . in an alternative treatment , we assume the standard model form of the amplitudes and use the data to investigate the energy dependence of the electromagnetic coupling constant ,",
    ". we have also used the data to search for evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "firstly we do this within a general framework in which possible contributions from extensions of the standard model are described by an effective four - fermion contact interaction .",
    "this analysis is essentially the same as those performed in references  @xcite , but the inclusion of data at 172  gev centre - of - mass energy gives significant improvements to the limits presented there . in the previous analysis of the hadronic cross - section we assumed the contact interaction was flavour - blind",
    "; here we extend the study to include the case where the new physics couples exclusively to one up - type quark or one down - type quark . in a second , more specific analysis , we set limits on the coupling strength of a new heavy particle which might be exchanged in @xmath3-channel production of hadronic final states . such a particle could be a squark , the supersymmetric partner of a quark , in theories where @xmath57-parity is violated , or a leptoquark , which is predicted in many theories which connect the quark and lepton sector of the standard model . in this analysis",
    "we assume that the new physics involves only one isomultiplet of heavy particles coupling with defined helicity .",
    "these studies are of topical interest in view of the indication of an anomaly at large momentum transfers in e@xmath58p collisions reported by the hera experiments  @xcite .",
    "contact interactions or production of a heavy particle have both been suggested as possible explanations  @xcite .",
    "finally , we place limits on gaugino pair production with subsequent decay of the chargino or neutralino into a light gluino and a quark pair in supersymmetric extensions to the standard model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we describe monte carlo simulations , the treatment of interference effects between initial- and final - state radiation and of the contributions from four - fermion final states . in section  [ sec : data ] detailed descriptions of the luminosity measurement and the analysis of hadronic events , of each lepton channel and of the measurement of are given .",
    "in section  [ sec : sm ] we compare measured cross - section and asymmetry values with standard model predictions , and use them to place constraints @xmath1-interference and @xmath59 . finally , in section  [ sec : new_phys ] we use our measurements to place limits on extensions of the standard model .",
    "the estimation of efficiencies and background processes makes extensive use of monte carlo simulations of many different final states . for studies of @xmath60 we used the pythia5.7  @xcite program with input parameters that have been optimized by a study of global event shape variables and particle production rates in decay data  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath61 we used the bhwide  @xcite monte carlo program , and for @xmath62 and @xmath63 the koralz4.0 program  @xcite .",
    "four - fermion events were modelled with the grc4f  @xcite , fermisv  @xcite and excalibur  @xcite generators , with pythia used to check the separate contributions from ww and we@xmath64 diagrams .",
    "two - photon background processes with hadronic final states were simulated using pythia and phojet  @xcite at low @xmath65 . at high @xmath65 the twogen  @xcite program with the ` perimiss ' option  @xcite",
    "was found to give the best description of data ; pythia and herwig  @xcite were also used for comparison .",
    "the vermaseren generator  @xcite was used to simulate purely leptonic final states in two - photon processes .",
    "the @xmath66 background in the  final state was modelled with the radcor  @xcite program , while the contribution from @xmath67 where the photon and one of the charged particles are inside the detector acceptance was modelled with teegg  @xcite .",
    "all samples were processed through the opal detector simulation program  @xcite and reconstructed as for real data . for the measurement of the luminosity , the cross - section for small - angle bhabha scattering was calculated using the monte carlo program bhlumi  @xcite , using generated events processed through a simulation program for the forward calorimetry .",
    "a feature of  collision data at energies well above the mass is a tendency for radiative return to the . if one or more initial - state radiation photons are emitted which reduce the effective centre - of - mass energy of the subsequent   collision @xmath53 to the region of the  resonance , the cross - section is greatly enhanced . in order to test the standard model at the highest possible energies , we separate clearly radiative events from those with @xmath68 using methods similar to those in previous analyses  @xcite . in this separation ,",
    "@xmath53 is defined as the centre - of - mass energy of the system after initial - state radiation .",
    "the existence of interference between initial- and final - state radiation means that there is an ambiguity in this definition .",
    "the monte carlo generators used to determine experimental efficiencies and acceptances do not include interference between initial- and final - state radiation , but these programs are used to correct the data , which do include interference .",
    "therefore further corrections have to be applied to the data before measurements can be compared with theoretical predictions .    for standard model predictions ( for all channels except , which is described below )",
    "we use the zfitter  @xcite program , which has an option either to enable or to disable interference between initial- and final - state radiation .",
    "we choose to use the option with interference disabled for our comparisons , and correct our measurements to account for this as explained below .",
    "this choice has the advantage of making the definition of @xmath69 unambiguous , and is more suitable for interpreting the measurements in terms of theoretical parameters .",
    "for example , the s - matrix ansatz used to fit the data , described in section  [ sec : blob ] , is unsuitable when the non - resonant part of the interference between initial- and final - state radiation contributes  @xcite .    to determine corrections to the measured cross - sections , we define a differential ` interference cross - section ' ( d@xmath70 / d@xmath71 d ) as the difference between the differential cross - section including initial - final state interference , and that excluding interference , ( d@xmath72 / d@xmath71 d ) , as calculated by zfitter using the appropriate flag settings .",
    "the differential interference cross - section may be either positive or negative , depending on the values of the cosine of the angle @xmath73 between the fermion and the electron beam direction , and the invariant mass of the fermion pair @xmath71 .",
    "we then estimate the fraction of this cross - section accepted by our selection cuts by assuming that , as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath71 , its selection efficiency @xmath75 where @xmath76 has been determined from monte carlo events which do not include interference .",
    "the corrected cross - section @xmath77 is obtained from the measured cross - section after background subtraction and efficiency correction @xmath78 as : @xmath79 in practice the integrals were evaluated in appropriate bins of  and @xmath71 . as the accepted cross - section is estimated as a function of @xmath74 , the method is easily applied to total cross - sections , angular distributions or asymmetry measurements .",
    "the systematic error on this procedure was assessed by repeating the estimate modifying the assumption of eq .",
    "[ eq : ifsreff ] to @xmath80 i.e.  for each bin of @xmath74 and @xmath71 the average of the efficiency in that bin and the efficiency in the bin including @xmath81 for the same @xmath74 range was used .",
    "this was motivated as follows .",
    "the efficiencies @xmath76 used for the interference correction are an average over events with initial - state radiation and events with final - state radiation , and are a good approximation to the true @xmath82 if these efficiencies are similar . for large @xmath71",
    "this is the case , but for small @xmath71 the efficiency for the relatively rare events with final - state radiation may be significantly higher than that for events with initial - state radiation . to account for this , the error on @xmath82 is taken as half the difference between the average efficiency @xmath83 , and the largest possible efficiency , @xmath84 at a given value of .    for the hadrons",
    "there is an additional uncertainty due to qcd effects .",
    "we have taken this additional uncertainty to be 100% of the correction without an @xmath69 cut .",
    "the basic assumption here is that the near - cancellation between virtual ( box ) and real interference effects without cuts ( kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem  @xcite ) is not completely destroyed by large qcd corrections to both .",
    "this has been proven for pure final - state radiation  @xcite , but not yet for initial - final state interference . in the absence of a theoretical calculation",
    "we allow the asymptotic value to change by 100% .",
    "the corrections to inclusive ( @xmath52 ) cross - sections are small , reflecting the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg cancellation . they typically amount to @xmath85% for muon pairs , @xmath86% for tau pairs and ( + 0.1@xmath870.1)% for hadrons , where the statistical errors are small compared to the systematic errors , derived as described above . for non - radiative events ( @xmath88 ) the corrections are rather larger , and",
    "are given in detail in table  [ tab : ifsr ] .",
    "the differences between the muon and tau corrections reflect the different acceptance cuts in @xmath74 used in the event selection ; the hadron corrections are of opposite sign from those of the leptons because of the quark charges .",
    "the corrections change the lepton asymmetry values by typically @xmath89 for @xmath52 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "all corrections depend only very weakly on @xmath50 .     &",

    "we generated two samples of muon pair events at 171 gev , and subjected them to the full detector simulation , reconstruction and event selection procedures .",
    "both samples were generated with only single photon emission . in the first sample",
    "there was no interference between initial- and final - state radiation , while in the second sample interference was enabled .",
    "the differences between the observed cross - sections and asymmetries agreed with the estimates from zfitter described above within one standard deviation , for both the inclusive ( @xmath52 ) and non - radiative ( @xmath91 ) cases .",
    "the above correction procedure has been applied to all cross - sections , asymmetry measurements and angular distributions , except for those for the  final state . in this case , we do not use a cut on @xmath69 so there is no ambiguity in its definition .",
    "both the standard model calculations and the monte carlo program used to calculate efficiency and acceptance corrections include interference between initial- and final - state radiation .",
    "results for  are therefore presented including such effects .",
    "contributions from four - fermion production @xmath105 to the process @xmath106 pose non - trivial problems both experimentally and theoretically . while four - fermion final states arising from the ` two - photon ' ( multiperipheral ) diagrams , for example , can be considered background to two - fermion production , those arising from the emission of low mass @xmath107 pairs in @xmath108-channel diagrams may in some circumstances be considered signal , in the same way as is emission of photons .",
    "a clean separation is not possible because of interference between diagrams contributing to the same final state .",
    "the correct experimental treatment of the four - fermion contribution depends on whether or not the theoretical calculation with which the experimental measurement is to be compared includes emission of fermion pairs .",
    "for example , alibaba  @xcite does not include such emission . by default zfitter",
    "includes initial - state pair emission via virtual photons , although this can be disabled .",
    "however , pair emission via virtual  bosons is not included . by comparing the predictions of zfitter with and without pair emission cut acts on fermion pairs as well as photons , since by default",
    "hard pair emission leading to @xmath109 is not included .",
    "] , we estimate that the effect of including it increases the cross - sections for @xmath110 by about 1% and decreases those for @xmath111 by about 0.1% at the energies considered here .",
    "similar values are obtained for hadrons and lepton pairs .",
    "final - state pair radiation is not explicitly treated in zfitter .",
    "the dominant part of its ( very small ) effect on the cross - section is covered in the inclusive treatment of final state radiation . for corrections to the selection efficiency , however , both initial- and final - state pair radiation have to be considered , as described below .",
    "none of the theoretical calculations to which we compare our data has an option to separate real from virtual fermion pair effects .",
    "therefore two- and four - fermion events have to be treated together in the data analysis . considering all four - fermion events as background , for example ,",
    "would not account for the virtual vertex corrections , which can be even larger than the effects of real pair emission .",
    "therefore some four - fermion events always have to be excluded from background estimates .    in general",
    ", we compare our measurements with zfitter predictions including pair emission .",
    "this means that pair emission via virtual photons from both the initial and final state must be included in efficiency calculations , and be excluded from background estimates . in order to perform the separation",
    ", we ignore interference between @xmath108- and @xmath3-channel diagrams contributing to the same four - fermion final state , and generate separate monte carlo samples for the different diagrams for each final state .",
    "for a two - fermion final state  we then include as signal those four - fermion events arising from @xmath108-channel processes for which @xmath112 , @xmath113 70  gev and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 in the non - radiative case ) .",
    "this kinematic classification closely models the desired classification of @xmath105 in terms of intermediate bosons , in that pairs arising from virtual photons are generally included as signal whereas those arising from virtual z bosons are not .",
    "all events arising from @xmath108-channel processes failing the above cuts , together with those arising from the @xmath3-channel process ( zee ) and two - photon processes are regarded as background .",
    "four - fermion processes involving ww or single w production are also background in all cases .",
    "the overall efficiency , @xmath116 , is calculated as @xmath117 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 are the efficiencies derived from the two - fermion and four - fermion signal monte carlo events respectively , @xmath120 is the generated four - fermion cross - section , and @xmath121 is the total cross - section from zfitter including pair emission . using this definition of efficiency , effects of cuts on soft pair emission in the four - fermion generator are correctly summed with vertex corrections involving virtual pairs .",
    "the inclusion of the four - fermion part of the signal produces negligible changes to the efficiencies for hadronic events and for lepton pairs with @xmath91 .",
    "the efficiencies for lepton pairs with @xmath52 are decreased by about 0.5% .",
    "the discussion in the above paragraph applies to hadronic , muon pair and tau pair final states . in the case of electron pairs ,",
    "the situation is slightly different . in principle",
    "the @xmath3-channel process with a second fermion pair arising from the conversion of a virtual photon emitted from an initial- or final - state electron should be included as signal . as this process",
    "is not included in any program we use for comparison we simply ignore such events : they are not included as background as this would underestimate the cross - section .",

    "data from three separate data - taking periods are used in this analysis :    * integrated luminosities of 2.7  pb@xmath125 and 2.6  pb@xmath125 recorded at  centre - of - mass energies of 130.25 and 136.22  gev , respectively , in 1995 ( lep1.5 ) .",

    "an integrated luminosity of 10.1  pb@xmath125 recorded at an centre - of - mass energy of 161.34@xmath870.05  gev  @xcite during 1996 . * an integrated luminosity of approximately 9.3  pb@xmath125 at an   centre - of - mass energy of 172.3  gev and 1.0  pb@xmath125 at an energy of 170.3  gev , recorded during 1996 .",
    "the data from these two energies have been analysed together ; the luminosity - weighted mean centre - of - mass energy has been determined to be 172.12@xmath870.06  gev  @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity was measured using small - angle bhabha scattering events , @xmath126 , recorded in the forward calorimetry .",
    "the primary detector is a silicon - tungsten luminometer  @xcite which consists of two finely segmented silicon - tungsten calorimeters placed around the beam pipe , symmetrically on the left and right sides on the opal detector , 2.4  m from the interaction point .",
    "each calorimeter covers angles from the beam between 25 and 59  mrad .",
    "bhabha scattering events were selected by requiring a high energy cluster in each end of the detector , using asymmetric acceptance cuts .",
    "the energy in each calorimeter had to be at least half the beam energy , and the average energy had to be at least three quarters of the beam energy .",
    "the two highest energy clusters were required to be back - to - back in @xmath124 , @xmath127 200  mrad , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the azimuthal angles of the cluster in the right- and left - hand calorimeter respectively .",
    "they were also required to be collinear , by placing a cut on the difference between the radial positions , @xmath130 25  mm , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the radial coordinates of the clusters on a plane approximately 7 radiation lengths into the calorimeter .",
    "this cut , corresponding to an acollinearity angle of about 10.4  mrad , effectively defines the acceptance for single - photon radiative events , thus reducing the sensitivity of the measurement to the detailed energy response of the calorimeter .",
    "the distribution of @xmath133 for the 172  gev data is shown in figure  [ fig : swlumi](a ) .",
    "for the 130136  gev data , the inner and outer radial acceptance cuts delimited a region between 31 and 52  mrad on one side of the calorimeter , while for the opposite calorimeter a wider zone between 27 and 56  mrad was used .",
    "two luminosity measurements were formed with the narrower acceptance on one side or the other side .",
    "the final measurement was the average of the two and has no first order dependence on beam offsets or tilts .",
    "before data - taking started at @xmath50=161  gev , tungsten shields designed to protect the tracking detectors from synchrotron radiation were installed around the beam pipe .",
    "the shields , 5  mm thick and 334  mm long , present roughly 50  radiation lengths to particles originating from the interaction region , almost completely absorbing electromagnetically showering particles between 26 and 33  mrad from the beam axis .",
    "the fiducial regions for accepting bhabha events for the 161 and 172  gev data were therefore reduced , to between 38 and 52  mrad on one side and between 34 and 56  mrad on the opposite side .",
    "the distributions of the radial coordinates of the clusters for the 172  gev data are shown in figure  [ fig : swlumi](b , c ) .",
    "the error on the luminosity measurement is dominated by data statistics .",
    "for the 130 and 136  gev data , the acceptance of the luminometer was reduced at the trigger level by a prescaling factor of 16 in order to increase the experimental live time as far as possible , giving a statistical error of 0.9% on the combined 130 and 136  gev data .",
    "for the two higher energies this prescaling factor was reduced to 2 or 4 , and the statistical error amounts to 0.42% ( 0.43% ) at 161 ( 172 )  gev .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty arises from theoretical knowledge of the cross - section ( 0.25% ) , with detector effects amounting to a further 0.20% ( 0.23% ) at 161 ( 172 )  gev .",
    "a second luminosity measurement was provided by the forward detector , a lead - scintillator sampling calorimeter covering angles from the beam between 40 and 150  mrad .",
    "the selection of bhabha events within the calorimeter acceptance is unchanged from reference  @xcite , but the acceptance was reduced to the region between 65 and 105  mrad from the beam because of the addition of the silicon - tungsten luminometer on the inside front edge of the device .",
    "the overall acceptance of the calorimeter was measured by normalizing to the precisely known cross - section for hadronic events at the  peak , and applying small corrections derived from monte carlo simulations to reflect changes in acceptance with centre - of - mass energy . to allow for changes in acceptance between years",
    ", this normalization was performed separately for 1995 and 1996 using data recorded at the  in each year .",
    "knowledge of the hadronic acceptance for the  data is the main source of systematic error in the forward detector luminosity measurement , which amounts to 0.8% ( 1.0% ) for the data taken in 1995 ( 1996 ) .",
    "the luminosity measured by the forward detector agreed with that measured by the silicon - tungsten luminometer to within one standard deviation of the combined error for all data samples . for the 130 and 136  gev data , where the precision of the two measurements was similar , the average luminosity was used ; the overall error on this average measurement is 0.7% . at 161 and 172",
    "gev the silicon - tungsten luminosity was preferred as the more precise ; the overall error on this measurement amounts to 0.53% ( 0.55% ) at 161 ( 172 )  gev .",
    "the errors on luminosity are included in the systematic errors on all cross - section measurements presented in this paper .",
    "correlations between cross - section measurements arising from errors in the luminosity have been taken into account in the interpretation of the results .",
    "the criteria used to select an inclusive sample of hadronic events with @xmath52 were based on energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the charged track multiplicity .",
    "clusters in the barrel region were required to have an energy of at least 100  mev , and clusters in the endcap detectors were required to contain at least two adjacent lead glass blocks and have an energy of at least 200  mev .",
    "tracks were required to have at least 20 measured space points .",
    "the point of closest approach to the nominal beam axis was found , and required to lie less than 2  cm in the @xmath135@xmath124 plane and less than 40  cm along the beam axis from the nominal interaction point .",
    "tracks were also required to have a minimum momentum component transverse to the beam direction of 50 mev .",
    "the following requirements were used to select hadronic candidates .    * to reject leptonic final states , events were required to have high multiplicity : at least 7  electromagnetic clusters and at least 5  tracks .",
    "* background from two - photon events was reduced by requiring a total energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter of at least 14% of the centre - of - mass energy : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the energy of each cluster . *",
    "any remaining background from beam - gas and beam - wall interactions was removed , and two - photon events further reduced , by requiring an energy balance along the beam direction which satisfied , where @xmath73 is the polar angle of the cluster .",
    "these criteria are identical to those used previously at 161  gev  @xcite , but the cut on @xmath138 is somewhat looser than that used previously at 130136  gev , resulting in a slightly higher efficiency for radiative return events .",

    "the background arises from ww events .",
    "no cuts have been applied to reject w - pair events ; the expected contribution from these to the visible cross - section has been subtracted , and amounts to ( 2.4@xmath870.2)% at 161  gev and ( 9.6@xmath870.2)% at 172  gev , where the error arises mainly from the uncertainty in the w mass  @xcite .",
