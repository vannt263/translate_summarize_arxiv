    "at very small values of @xmath1 it is expected that the number density of partons within the proton becomes so large that they begin to recombine with each other .",
    "this phenomenon of parton recombination is also referred to as absorptive corrections , non - linear effects , screening , shadowing , or unitarity corrections , all leading to saturation .",
    "the first perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations describing the fusion of two pomeron ladders into one were made by gribov - levin - ryskin ( glr ) @xcite and by mueller - qiu ( mq ) @xcite .",
    "the glrmq equations add an extra non - linear term , quadratic in the gluon density , to the usual dglap equations for the gluon and sea - quark evolution .",
    "the evolution of the gluon distribution is then given by @xmath6 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 fm is of the order of the proton radius .",
    "the glrmq equations account for all ` fan ' diagrams , that is , all possible @xmath8 ladder recombinations , in the double leading logarithmic approximation ( dlla ) which resums all powers of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "there has been much recent theoretical activity in deriving ( and studying ) more precise non - linear evolution equations , such as the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) and jalilian - marian  iancu  mclerran  weigert  leonidov  kovner ( jimwlk ) equations ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "note that the bk and jimwlk equations are both based on bfkl evolution .",
    "however , for the most relevant studies in the hera and lhc domain ( @xmath10 ) , the predominant theoretical framework is collinear factorisation with dglap - evolved parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . at very small values of @xmath1",
    "it might be expected that the dglap approximation would break down , since large @xmath11 ( bfkl ) terms would appear in the perturbation series in addition to the @xmath12 terms resummed by dglap evolution .",
    "however , it turns out that the resummed nll bfkl calculations of the gluon splitting function @xmath13 @xcite and the gluon transverse momentum distribution @xcite are rather close to the dglap calculations .",
    "moreover , the convolution @xmath14 coincides with the nnlo dglap result and is close to the nlo dglap result for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "hence , in the analysis of current data , it is reasonable to ignore bfkl effects .",
    "if recombination effects are significant , it is therefore important that they be incorporated into the global dglap parton analyses which determine the pdfs from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and related hard - scattering data .",
    "such a programme , based on glrmq evolution ( which accounts for gluon - induced screening only ) , was implemented some years ago @xcite , before the advent of hera .",
    "the input gluon and sea - quark distributions were _ assumed _ to have a small-@xmath1 behaviour of the form @xmath15 at an input scale of @xmath16 gev@xmath17 .",
    "the inclusion of shadowing effects , both in the form of the input pdfs and in the glrmq evolution , was found to significantly _ decrease _ the size of the small-@xmath1 gluon distribution in comparison with the result with no absorptive corrections .",
    "a crucial observation is that , at that time ( 1990 ) , @xmath0 data were only available for @xmath18 , and so these results were largely dependent on the theoretical assumptions made for the starting distributions .",
    "however , with hera , we now have @xmath0 data down to @xmath19 or less , and so the pdfs at small @xmath1 can be determined directly from the hera data .",
    "in fact , the advent of hera data has led to a puzzling behaviour of the small-@xmath1 gluon and sea - quark pdfs at low scales @xmath20 .",
    "if we write @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then the expectation of regge theory is that @xmath23 for low scales @xmath24 gev , where @xmath25 @xcite is the power of @xmath26 obtained from fitting soft hadron data . at higher @xmath27 gev",
    ", qcd evolution should take over , increasing the powers @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , the current mrst2004 nlo @xcite and cteq6.1 m @xcite pdf sets exhibit a very different behaviour at low scales from that theoretically expected ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : mrstcteq ] .",
    "in fact , the mrst group has found that a negative input gluon distribution at @xmath30 gev is required in all their nlo dglap fits since mrst2001 @xcite .",
    "the cteq group , who take a slightly higher input scale of @xmath31 gev , also find a negative gluon distribution when evolving backwards to 1 gev .",
    "gev@xmath17 found in the mrst2004 nlo @xcite and cteq6.1 m @xcite global analyses .",
    "the valence - like behaviour of the gluon is evident.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since data at small @xmath32 now exist , the introduction of the absorptive corrections is expected to _ increase _ the size of the input gluon distribution at small @xmath1 to maintain a satisfactory fit to the data . to understand this , note that the negative non - linear term in the glrmq equation slows down the evolution .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to start with a _ larger _",
    "small-@xmath1 gluon distribution at low scales @xmath33 to achieve the _ same _ pdfs at larger scales required to describe the data .",
    "if the non - linear term is neglected , the input small-@xmath1 gluon distribution is forced to be artificially small in order to _ mimic _ the neglected screening corrections .",
    "we have anticipated that the introduction of absorptive corrections will _ _ enhance _ _",
    "gev@xmath17 , then evolving upwards with the glrmq equations based on lo dglap evolution , improves the agreement with @xmath0 data at small @xmath32 and low @xmath20 compared to the standard cteq sets , and leads to an enhanced small-@xmath1 gluon distribution for @xmath34 gev@xmath17 .",
    "note , however , that there is a large nlo correction to the splitting function @xmath35 which changes completely the relationship between the quark and gluon distributions , and so weakens the conclusion of ref .  @xcite . ] the small-@xmath1 gluon at low scales , and hence could possibly avoid what appears to be anomalous behaviour at small @xmath1 .",
    "thus , here , we perform such a study using an abridged version of the mrst2001 nlo analysis @xcite , improving on our previous analysis @xcite . first , we derive a more precise form of the glrmq equations .",

    "we take @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) gev@xmath87 for light ( charm ) quarks , which would correspond to @xmath88 ( 1.1 ) fm .",
    "the procedure for incorporating absorptive corrections into a ( nlo ) global parton analysis ( in the ffns ) is as follows :    1 .",
    "parameterise the @xmath1 dependence of the input pdfs at a scale @xmath89 gev .",
    "2 .   evolve the pdfs @xmath90 and @xmath76 using the non - linear evolution equation .",

    "the second term corresponds to the process @xmath93 , for light quarks with a longitudinally polarised photon .",
    "these contributions are calculated as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as usual ,",
    "these three steps should be repeated with the parameters of the input pdfs adjusted until an optimal fit is obtained .",
    "this procedure is our recommended way of accounting for absorptive corrections in a global parton analysis .",
    "however , in practice , available nlo dglap evolution codes , such as the qcdnum @xcite program , are often regarded as a ` black box ' , and it is not trivial to modify the usual linear dglap evolution to the non - linear evolution of .",
    "therefore , we adopt an alternative iterative procedure which avoids the explicit implementation of non - linear evolution , but which is equivalent to the above procedure .",
    "we model our analysis of hera @xmath0 data @xcite on the mrst2001 nlo analysis @xcite , which was the first in which a negative gluon distribution was required at the input scale of @xmath94 gev .",
    "( the more recent mrst sets have not changed substantially at small @xmath1 . )",
    "we apply cuts @xmath95 , @xmath96 gev@xmath17 , and @xmath97 gev@xmath17 , leaving @xmath98 data points .",
    "the input gluon and sea - quark distributions are taken to be @xmath99 where the powers of the @xmath100 factors are taken from @xcite , together with the valence - quark distributions , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath104 parameter is fixed by the momentum sum rule , while the other nine parameters are allowed to go free .",
    "since we do not fit to dis data with @xmath105 , we constrain the input gluon and sea - quark distributions , and their derivatives with respect to @xmath1 , to agree with the mrst2001 nlo parton set @xcite at @xmath106 .",
    "this is done by including the value of these mrst pdfs at @xmath106 , and their derivatives , as data points in the fit , with an error of 10% on both the value of the mrst pdfs and their derivatives .",
    "therefore , the pdfs we obtain are not precisely constrained at large @xmath1 , but this paper is primarily concerned with the small-@xmath1 behaviour of the pdfs .    the procedure we adopt is as follows :",
    "1 .   start by performing a standard nlo dglap fit to @xmath0 data with no absorptive corrections .",
    "2 .   tabulate @xmath39 , given by , and @xmath107 , given by , using pdfs @xmath108 and @xmath109 obtained from the previous fit .",
    "3 .   perform a standard nlo dglap fit to ` corrected ' data , @xmath110 , to obtain pdfs @xmath111 . then correct these pdfs to obtain @xmath112 .",
    "these latter pdfs @xmath113 then satisfy the non - linear evolution equations .",
    "go to ( ii ) .",
    "each successive iteration of steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) introduces another level of @xmath37 pomeron mergings , so that eventually all the ` fan ' diagrams are included , achieving the same effect as the procedure described at the end of section [ sec : non - linear ] .    note",
    "that the correction to the pdfs , @xmath112 , in each step ( iii ) , was omitted in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "consequently , the effect of the absorptive corrections on the pdfs at large scales was overestimated .",
    "also in @xcite , the known lo @xmath114 were multiplied by free parameters ( ` k - factors ' ) , determined from separate fits to diffractive dis data , in an attempt to account for higher - order pqcd corrections to the lo pomeron - to - parton splitting functions . however , since these k - factors took unreasonable values , with some going to zero , here we have chosen to fix them to 1 .",
    "therefore , the updated analysis , presented here , does not require a simultaneous fit to the diffractive dis data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon](a ) we show the gluon distribution at scales @xmath115 , @xmath86 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 gev@xmath17 obtained from fits before and after absorptive corrections have been included .",

    "the absorptive corrections give an increased gluon distribution at small @xmath1 , apart from at @xmath121 where there are only a few data points and where additional absorptive effects ( pomeron loops ) may become important .",
    "the non - linear term of slows down the evolution , so that by @xmath117 gev@xmath17 the two gluon distributions are roughly equal ; see fig .  [",

    "when absorptive corrections were included , almost the same quality of fit was obtained ( @xmath122 ) , while without absorptive corrections the fit was slightly worse ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we conclude that absorptive corrections lessen the need for a negative gluon distribution at @xmath115 gev@xmath17 .",
    "the gluon distributions obtained from six successive iterations of steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon](b ) .",
    "the convergence is fairly rapid , with only the first three iterations having a significant effect , that is , the ` fan ' diagrams which include @xmath124 pomeron mergings .",
    "although we have seen that the inclusion of absorptive corrections has reduced the need for a _ negative _ gluon , it has not solved the problem of the _ valence - like _ gluon .",
    "that is , the gluon distribution at low scales still decreases with decreasing @xmath1 , whereas from regge theory it is expected to behave as @xmath125 with @xmath25 .",
    "we have studied several possibilities of obtaining a satisfactory fit with this behaviour @xcite .",
    "the only modification which appears consistent with the data ( and with the desired @xmath126 equality ) is the inclusion of power - like corrections , specifically , a global shift in all scales by about 1 gev@xmath17 .",
    "( note that a similar shift in the scale is required in the dipole saturation model @xcite . )",
