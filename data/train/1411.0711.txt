    "mechanical oscillators coupled to optical degrees of freedom in a nano - cavity via radiation pressure have received immense attention as an important frontier in the field of quantum optics around the globe @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances have led to observe mechanical dynamics provided by radiation pressure in the laboratory .",
    "owning the discrete nature of photons , the quantum fluctuations of the radiation pressure give rise to the standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "in addition to the _ quantum back - action _",
    "effect , the radiation pressure of light confined within a resonator , give rise to the effect of dynamical back - action @xcite , which is a _ classical effect _ caused by finite cavity decay time .",
    "these devices have been suggested to analyze the optical bistability @xcite and nonlinear dynamics @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "rapid developments in atom optics @xcite have made this subject a testing ground for the dynamical localization  @xcite , dynamical recurrences @xcite , bifurcation response @xcite , and classical quantum transition @xcite .    in classical mechanics ,",
    "the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions becomes the hallmark of chaos @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that hamiltonian systems are carriers of chaos , and in general , the phase space of such a system contains regions where regular motion is accompanied by stochasticity @xcite .",
    "certain subtle properties of chaos can be linked to the phenomenon of the diffusion of particles and to the problem of the symmetry of the tilings of a space @xcite .",
    "the existence of stochastic webs is an important physical phenomenon since infinite particle transport is performed along the channels of the web .",
    "hence , the skeleton of the web tiles the phase space and imposes a dynamical origin on symmetry groups ( namely , the crystalline and quasicrystalline symmetry ) .",
    "the kicked harmonic oscillator is an example of such a system @xcite . in the present work , we model the optomechanical system in which nano - mechanical membrane experiences periodic kicks .",
    "we report that the classical system exhibits complex evolution in phase space . as a result",
    ", we obtain crystalline as well as quasicrystalline symmetrical structures .",
    "our contribution leads to investigate a complex symmetry in optomechanical systems by developing a web map using methods of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the paper is developed as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we present the experimental model of the system.we introduce the dynamical mapping in sect .  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "several properties of the kicked membrane have been explored in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we investigate various aspects of stability and unstability of the system by means of lyapunov exponent and survival probability . finally , the results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "our nano - optomechanical system consists of a febry - prot cavity , which is coupled with two fixed end - mirrors , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cavity ] .",
    "a thin mechanical membrane with perfectly reflecting surfaces is placed inside the cavity .",
    "similar system has been studied to cool mechanical membrane @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of system can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian for the membrane with effective mass @xmath3 and the bare eigen - frequency @xmath4 , and @xmath5 describes the optomechanical coupling between single - mode optically driven cavities a and b respectively with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being lowering ( raising ) field operators . here ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath4 respectively , are the field frequencies for cavity @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the membrane .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 are the amplitudes of external optical driving fields to the cavities with corresponding driving frequencies @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the corresponding optomechanical coupling strengths via the radiation pressure , and @xmath15 are the lengths of cavities a and b.    under the same condition as in @xcite , we obtain the effective hamiltonian ,        @xmath16    [ ham ] the symbol @xmath17 is the amplitude of external optical driving fields with corresponding driving frequencies @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the corresponding optomechanical coupling strength via radiation pressure and @xmath20 is the optical detuning .",
    "note that , the last term in the above hamiltonian can be approximated to @xmath21 , under the condition @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian becomes , @xmath24 here @xmath25 .",
    "we also ignore the effects from cavity decay rates @xmath26 of cavity fields based on the fact that @xmath27 is much less than the detuning @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we consider the short time interaction between optical field and membrane into account , this periodic nature of the radition pressure force makes the nano - mechanical membrane in the optomechanical system as kicked harmonic oscillator .",
    "we may express the periodic kicks by @xmath28 which yields the effective hamiltonian as , @xmath29 in which perturbation is a periodic sequence of @xmath30-pulses ( i.e. kicks ) following with the time period @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) correspond to amplitude of the pulses .",
    "note that in the absence of kicks i.e. for @xmath34 ( when there are no external fields ) , the motion of the membrane is simple harmonic .",
    "interestingly , the effective hamiltonian that we have obtained so far , describes the dynamics of the kicked membrane just like a conventional @xmath30-kick harmonic oscillator . since , in the presence of @xmath35-kicks , the dynamics of the oscillating membrane switches from harmonic to forced , and we may express it by the following classical hamilton equations , @xmath36",
    "it is obvious that between two consecutive interactions i.e. kicks , the time evolution is simply that of a conventional harmonic oscillator , given by @xcite @xmath37 in order to understand the evolution at the time of kick , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) , at an arbitrary kick @xmath38 .",
    "this yields @xmath39 where @xmath40 tends to zero .",
    "the equation connects the momentum just before @xmath41th impact with momentum just after the kick .",
    "as @xmath40 tends to zero the remaining integral in above equation vanishes , leaving us with @xmath42    [ q3 ] [ q4 ]            we can now combine this with the equations of motion for the harmonic oscillator to derive a mapping from just before one kick to just before the next .",
    "we introduce the convenient shorthand @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "before we start exploring the dynamics of the web map obtained in eq .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) , a better choice is re - scaling the variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 to dimensionless quantities in order to reduce the number of free parameters , by defining @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , kick to kick mapping with dimensionless parameters can be rewritten as : @xmath54 where , @xmath55 .",
    "it is now apparent that we have exactly two free parameters : the dimensionless kicking strength @xmath56 , and the dimensionless frequency ratios @xmath0 ( or kick to kick period ) given by , @xmath57 in the next section we see that the parameter @xmath58 plays an important role in the evolution . for simplicity",
    "we omit bar from the variables i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 in later discussions . in the next section we study the effect of parameters @xmath56 and @xmath0 on the phase space structures and @xmath0-fold symmetry .",
    "it should be noted that for kicked systems there occur two frequencies : one natural frequency of the system and the frequency of the periodic kicks .",
    "so , the dynamics produced by the mapping described in eq .",
    "( [ web - map ] ) can be grouped into two broad categories : one where the frequency ratio @xmath0 is a rational number , that is the membrane is kicked a rational number of times per harmonic oscillator period ; and the second , where @xmath0 is an irrational number .",
    "we concentrate on the case where @xmath0 is rational , which has interesting particular properties showing very fascinating patterns as a phase portrait .",
    "sample of these stroboscopic poincar sections of the dynamics described by the mapping of eq .",
    "( [ web - map ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ phase portraits ] .",
    "the initial condition in each of the cases displayed in fig .",
    "[ phase portraits ] is iterated over @xmath59 kicks . in order to explicitly demonstrate the complex dynamics of nano- mechanical membrane",
    ", we use the experimental parameters from refs .",
    "@xcite such that : the length of the optomechanical cavity @xmath60 mm , the optical detuning @xmath61 hz , the effective mass of the membrane @xmath62 pg , the bare eigenfrequency of the membrane @xmath63 khz , the eigenfrequency of the optical cavity @xmath64 hz .",
    "these parameters make it possible to realize theoretical work in present day laboratory experiments . in numerical experiments , we take the value of @xmath65 whereas the frequency ratio @xmath0 governs the @xmath0-fold symmetry i.e. in fig .",
    "[ phase portraits ] we show phase portraits displaying : ( a ) _ three - fold symmetry _ , ( b ) _ four - fold symmetry _ and so on .",
    "we see that there is obviously a high degree of rotational symmetry as well as self similarity in the trajectories taken .",
    "the symmetry is essentially rotational in phase space .",
    "however , the unpredictable part of the point particle s dynamics moving in phase space is more in knowing how it moves in and out through phase space .",
    "the symmetric structure brought out by these stable and unstable dynamics makes _",
    "stochastic web _ , as there is an interconnected web of channels which spread through all of the phase space .",
    "note that , the dynamically obtained @xmath0-fold symmetry for the resonance condition in eq .",
    "( [ resonance ] ) , is of the crystalline type for @xmath66 and the quasi - crystalline type for @xmath67 . in all phase portraits in fig .",
    "[ phase portraits ] , the dots belong to a trajectory in the domain of chaotic dynamics ( stochastic sea ) and the curves are closures at the poincar map for quasi - periodic structures , also known as islands of stability @xcite .",
    "isolated domains in chaotic motion exists inside the islands .",
    "interestingly , a magnification of an island shows resemblance with main pictures in fig .  [ phase portraits ] .",
    "thus , the self - similar behaviour confirms the complexity of the chaotic dynamics and existence of fractals .",
    "the coexistence of both regions of stable dynamics and chaos in the phase space , enables us to analyze the onset of chaos and the appearance of the minimal region of chaos @xcite .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the classification of global phase portraits of planar quartic quasi - homogeneous polynomial differential systems @xcite and bounded solutions of a complex permanent magnet synchronous motor ( pmsm ) system @xcite , these phase portraits contains stable as well as complex quasi periodic structures .    furthermore , the mapping described in eq .",
    "( [ web - map ] ) can be rewritten in more compact form as a single equation in terms of a single complex variable @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is a complex number and its real and imaginary parts describe position and momentum of the moving membrane at the @xmath74 impact .",
    "this more compact description is often advantageous when investigating symmetry properties of the system .",
    "for example , if @xmath75 , the mapping will describe rotations through @xmath76 over one step .",
    "the evolution of the membrane in the presence of the radiation - pressure force , therefore , becomes @xmath77 the function @xmath78 , therefore , transforms the event @xmath72 of the phase space into @xmath79 . it should be noted that , the transformation , as given in eq .  ( [ tr ] ) , is a sum of two evolutions : the first term expresses the phase change over one period between short time interactions or kicks , and the second term expresses the influence of periodic kicks . in order to explore more about the stochastic web , after a few numerical experiments",
    ", we take single - trajectories of the several resonance cases starting from a random initial condition between @xmath80 as shown in fig .",
    "[ random ] .    here ,",
    "we select most relevant trajectories showing symmetrically stable and unstable regions of the stochastic web .",
    "we also explore that the fixed points obey the relation @xmath81 which indicates that they appear along a straight line .",
    "the slope of the line depends on the value of @xmath0 , which determines @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore the line always passes through origin and produces @xmath0-fold symmetry .",
    "we evaluate stability of our kicked membrane locally using eigenvalues based on straight - forward algebra . in order to start stability analysis linearly",
    ", the appropriate candidate is the jacobian matrix written as , @xmath84 it can be seen that the determinant of the jacobian is equal to one , that is @xmath85 , which implies that our web map is area preserving . in order to investigate the border between stable and unstable manifolds ( trajectories ) ,",
    "the eigen - values obey the relation @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the trace and determinant of the jacobian respectively . in order to examine the stability ,",
    "these - eigen values directly lead us to study what is known as the exponential divergence in the evolution of the neighboring trajectories i.e. _ lyapunov exponent_.     and @xmath89.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    if the initial coordinates are say @xmath90 and @xmath91 , then at a later time they will have values @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for our stochastic web map ,",
    "eigen - values are complex for @xmath94 and real outside of this interval . in the case of",
    "@xmath95 the evolution remains stable at origin , which is confirmed analytically as the corresponding real part is negative , whereas for all the rest of the cases the dynamics is unstable ( fig .",
    "[ phase portraits ] ) .    in order to describe exponential divergence ( an important consequence of presence of chaos ) of neighboring trajectories ,",
    "we start with two different , but very close , initial points .",
    "mathematically the lyapunov exponent for the discrete map starting with some point @xmath96 is given by , @xmath97 the distance between the iterates of these points should increase exponentially with time if the initial points are in a chaotic region of the phase space .",
    "a plot of the natural logarithm of this distance versus the number of iterations is shown in fig .",
    "the above plot has been created using initial points @xmath98 which lies in a stochastic region and another in its neighbourhood viz . , @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the growth of lyapunov exponent indicates the presence of chaos in our system .",
    "moreover , we plot the eigenvalues @xmath100 against @xmath48 and @xmath0 in fig .",
    "these values , @xmath100 ( either being positive in case of real or in case of complex the real part being positive ) make the system unstable and positive lyapunov exponent indicates an exponential divergence .",
    "next we compute the survival probability of the trajectories of the phase portraits obtained in fig .",
    "[ phase portraits ] .",
    "the survival probability is the probability for the oscillator to stay in a bounded region , @xmath101 , and is given by @xcite @xmath102 here , @xmath103 is the total number of trajectories in the initial ensemble and @xmath104 correspond to the number of trajectories that exited the bounded region by discrete time ( or number of kicks ) @xmath41 .     between the kicks",

    "physically , the initial conditions correspond to spreading trajectories all over the phase space .",
    "the survival probability @xmath108 provides us the information that what fraction of total trajectories survive in a particular region , whereas @xmath109 then corresponds to the information of escape of trajectories from that region .",
    "another motivation behind @xmath108 comes from the fact that it corresponds exactly to the distribution of poincar surface of section that fills the entire phase space @xcite .",
    "[ sp ] shows the survival probability for the case of @xmath105 for the different values of the kicking strength @xmath56 .",
    "the ( black ) solid - line shows the survival probability for @xmath65 and ( blue ) dotted - line corresponds to the case of @xmath106 . in our simulations",
    ", we consider the same initial point that we used for the lyapunov exponent in fig .",
    "[ div ] which lies in a stochastic region .",
    "it can be seen that , for higher value of the kicking strength @xmath56 , more trajectories can survive in a particular stochastic region .",
    "in conclusion , we study the dynamical properties of mechanical nano- membrane in an optomechanical system .",
    "we show that the classical phase space of our system displays the presence of stochastic structures and @xmath0-_fold symmetry_. it spans the entire phase space for the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath0 . in order to understand the evolution of the system , in our analytical work we develop discrete web map .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the nano - mechanical membrane , in the presence of periodic delta kicks provided by radiation pressure force , displays quasiperiodic structures .",
    "we show that the change in the evolution takes place as the symmetry , resulting due to the condition on kicks at equal displacement , disappears .",
