    "the orthodox theory of coulomb blockade@xcite is a cornerstone of the present understanding of charge transport in single - electron devices@xcite . in this theory",
    "the device ( a small metal , semiconductor or fullerene island and electrodes ) is modeled using an equivalent electric circuit with macroscopic components ( capacitors and resistors ) .",
    "electronic interactions that control the passage of charge through the island are accounted for classically by an electrostatic _ charging _ energy @xmath0 .",
    "the quantum nature of the island is incorporated through the discreteness of its energy levels .",
    "the statistical properties of the electron wavefunctions and energy levels are usually described within the frame of random matrix theory@xcite or by exact diagonalization of a microscopic hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the average energy level separation @xmath1 and @xmath0 set the energy scales of the transport problem .",
    "the orthodox theory works impressively well for mesoscopic islands . nevertheless , recently , a new generation of nanoscopic metallic islands ( _ nanoislands _ ) has yielded surprising tunneling spectroscopy results@xcite which have led theoreticians to extend the orthodox theory in order to successfully account @xcite for some of the novel observations .    in this paper ,",
    "the orthodox theory is extended further in order to explore the microscopic effects of environmental electric fields on the tunneling spectroscopy of these nanoislands .",
    "these effects are due to penetration of the fields into the island , therefore they become more significant as the size of the island is reduced . to our knowledge",
    "they have not been considered previously in the experimental or theoretical literature .",
    "our paradigm for studying them will be the transistor introduced by ralph , black and tinkham@xcite , although environmental fields should affect all nanoscopic single - electron transistors .",
    "we show that environmental fields result in an",
    "_ electrostatic renormalization _ of the electronic states of the nanoisland that is beyond the scope of the standard orthodox theory .",
    "this renormalization exhibits nearly - gaussian fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of the electron wavefunctions .",
    "furthermore , we predict the occurrence of avoided crossings and level bending due to the coupling between electronic levels induced by the fields .",
    "we show that these phenomena are reflected directly in the behavior of tunneling resonances ; this establishes a platform for probing the environmental coupling experimentally .",
    "the fluctuations in the slopes of the tunneling resonances vs. gate voltage that we predict are surprisingly strong , comparable in size to the unrenormalized slope predicted by orthodox theory .",
    "we demonstrate that by observing these fluctuations it is possible to assess the amplitudes of the electronic wavefunctions at the surface of an ultra - small conductor . moreover , the statistics of the wavefunctions at the surface of the nanoparticle can be separated from those in the bulk and measured .",
    "no way to measure these important properties of nanoparticle electron wave functions has been known until now .",
    "we conclude that a novel fingerprint of the electron wavefunctions at the surfaces of nanoscopic conductors can be found in tunneling spectroscopy experiments .",
    "we now introduce the environmental electric fields . the model geometry@xcite is shown in fig . [ fig_1](a ) : three macroscopic electrodes labeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the source and drain contacts ) and @xmath4 ( the gate ) , are separated from the central nanoisland ( @xmath5 ) by thin insulating layers of thickness @xmath6 , and are connected to voltage sources @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 which drive the island to a potential @xmath10 $ ] in the orthodox theory .",
    "@xmath11 is the charge on the nanoisland .",

    "the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 sets an electric field at the nanoisland surface ( @xmath21 ) that faces electrode _",
    "i_. the electric field has a finite penetration depth ( @xmath22 ) into the conductor ( in the standard orthodox model @xmath23 ) that causes the electrostatic potential within the nanoisland to deviate from @xmath20 . this deviation ( @xmath24 )",
    "is sketched in figure [ fig_1](b ) . assuming that the electric field within the metal nanoisland is screened exponentially@xcite , @xmath25 at a distance @xmath26 along the direction normal to @xmath21 can be estimated as @xmath27 @xmath28 is a polarization enhancement factor , where @xmath29 is the dielectric constant of the insulating material , and @xmath30 ( @xmath31@xmath32 for al@xcite ) . due to the effective screening ( small @xmath22 ) in metals ,",
    "only atoms near the surface are significantly perturbed by the electrostatic potential energy @xmath33.@xcite however , in the _ nanoscopic _ regime the substantial surface - to - volume ratio ( @xmath34 ) of the nanoisland warrants the inclusion of @xmath35 in the calculation of its electronic structure .",
    "@xmath35 causes what we call the _ microscopic electrostatic renormalization _ of the energy levels , that is not included in the standard orthodox theory .",
    "this renormalization is _ in addition _ to the _ bulk _ or _ macroscopic _ one due to @xmath36 that is included in the standard orthodox theory .",
    "we begin by exploring the effects of @xmath35 analytically within perturbation theory .",
    "we then present results of our _ non - perturbative _ computer simulations that apply to specific real systems : al nanoislands with oxide tunnel barriers .",
    "we define the _ microscopic _ contribution to the energy @xmath38 of level @xmath39 to be @xmath40 , where @xmath41 labels the charge state of the nanoisland .",
    "let @xmath42 be an electronic eigenstate for @xmath43 .",

    "then , to first order in @xmath37 , ( setting for simplicity @xmath48 ) @xmath49 is _ linear _ in @xmath9 with slope ( see appendix [ derivation_0 ] )    @xmath50 \\end{array } } , \\label{eq_slopes}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the amplitude of @xmath52 at atomic site @xmath53 of the nanoisland .",
    "@xmath54 is the distance of site @xmath53 from the surface @xmath21 . because @xmath22 is smaller than the size of the nanoisland the leading terms in the summations correspond to atomic sites on the surfaces",
    "the surface of the nanoisland presents atomic scale disorder .",
    "consequently , in the absence of magnetic fields , the electronic structure is described by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 is a random variable that obeys a @xmath55 distribution @xcite .",
    "thus the slope @xmath56 _ fluctuates _ from state to state@xcite reflecting the microscopic details of the electron wavefunctions at the surfaces of the nanoisland . due to the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq_slopes ] ) the fluctuations are nearly - gaussian according to the central limit theorem .",
    "these observations remain valid for arbitrary @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we conclude from this analysis that the microscopic effects of the environmental electric fields lead to a fluctuating renormalization ( _ microscopic electrostatic renormalization _ ) of the electronic levels of a conducting nanoisland . it should be noted that in the standard orthodox model ( @xmath59 ) @xmath60 is zero .",
    "consider now the implications of this microscopic effect for the tunneling spectroscopy of the nano - transistors .",
    "suppose @xmath61 at @xmath62 and fixed @xmath9 , and then , after increasing the bias , an electron tunnels in from electrode @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) so that @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath39 is being populated by the tunneling electron the transition is favorable only if the final state energy of the electron is lower than @xmath66 , the fermi energy of electrode @xmath63 : @xmath67ev -(c_g / c_{\\sigma})e v_g$ ] , where @xmath68 is the charging energy@xcite .",
    "( note that the _ macroscopic _ renormalization due to @xmath11 ( through @xmath0 ) , @xmath57 and @xmath9 constitutes the orthodox model . )",
    "a similar restriction applies to tunneling transitions from the neutral nanoisland to electrode @xmath3 .",

    "is reached a peak ( a threshold resonance ( _ tr _ ) ) appears in the differential conductance @xmath70@xcite .",
    "we now analyze the effect of @xmath9 on the _ tr _ , focusing on @xmath71 transitions . in the perturbative regime",
    "we find ( see appendix [ derivation ] )    @xmath72^{-1 } + \\dots \\right\\ } , \\label{slopes}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ slopes ] ) shows that the positions of the resonances in the @xmath70 spectrum shift linearly with @xmath9 . the first term on the right in eq . ( [ slopes ] )",
    "is the ( _ macroscopic _ ) slope predicted by standard orthodox theory@xcite ; the other terms are due to microscopic effects .",
    "this analysis shows that the expected _ macroscopic _ slope of the _ tunneling resonances _ is _ microscopically _ renormalized .",
    "furthermore , the slope of each resonance in the spectrum is different as a consequence of the _ fluctuations_. therefore it should be possible to study the coupling of the nanoisland s electronic levels to the environment by tunneling spectroscopy , and thus obtain experimental information on the electron wavefunction .",
    "so far our exposition , although perturbative , has been general . to understand the effects of the electric fields on the electronic structure and tunneling spectroscopy _ beyond perturbation theory _ , we now consider al nanoislands coated with al - oxide within a tight - binding model @xcite with the on - site orbital energies of the isolated neutral al / al - oxide nanoisland adapted to include @xmath35 .",
    "the presence of the oxide coating introduce surface disorder in these nanoislands , as explained in ref .",
    "( see also ref . ) .",
    "we consider disc - shaped nanoislands of volume @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , @xmath76and @xmath77@xcite the latter choice assures that tunneling from the gate is suppressed .",
    "the parameters for two such systems are shown in table [ tab : table_1 ] .",
    "the fermi energies of the neutral isolated nanoislands ( @xmath78 ) differ due to their differing structural disorder and geometries .",
    "the latter are also responsible for the differing capacitances .",
    "the _ charging _",
    "voltage @xmath79 is the upwards ( downwards ) shift of @xmath20 as one electron is removed ( added ) from ( to ) the nanoisland ; the _ degeneracy _ gate voltage @xmath80 is , within the standard orthodox theory@xcite , the value of @xmath9 at which an electron is added ( @xmath81 ) to or removed ( @xmath82 ) from the nanoisland at @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] shows results of the exact diagonalization of the tight binding hamiltonian for @xmath40 for a few energy levels of transistors @xmath83 and @xmath84 under different bias and gate conditions , at @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath9 ranges from approximately @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath57 lies within the first step of the coulomb staircase ( at @xmath43 ) of the nanoisland .",
    "let us first focus on the effects of @xmath9 at @xmath62 .",
    "the striking features are : i ) _ fluctuating _ renormalization of the slopes of the energy levels due to the applied electric field , ii ) linear dependence of some energy levels on @xmath9 , and iii ) level bending and avoided crossings with increasing @xmath88 .",
    "these features are qualitatively similar regardless the values of @xmath58 or @xmath57 ( not shown ) .",
    "we now proceed to discuss them .",
    "i ) and ii ) can be understood within the perturbative argument presented above .",
    "regarding iii ) it should be noted that as @xmath88 increases significant enhancement of @xmath89 can occur due to increased coupling between levels and level proximity induced by @xmath9 . in this case , the microscopic contribution to the energy levels should be calculated to higher order in @xmath37 .",
    "level bending signals the response of the energy levels to this change in the electronic coupling . as @xmath88 increases some energy levels",
    "become nearly degenerate .",
    "since these levels are in general mixed by @xmath35 this results in avoided crossings in the spectrum .",
    "thus level bending and avoided crossings as a function of gate bias should be general features of the spectra of these nano - transistors : electric fields should effectively couple quasi - particle levels ( which may even involve electronic excitations ) that belong to the same hilbert space _ and _ whose wavefunctions are such that the strength parameter @xmath89 is significant . the microscopic effect of the source - drain voltage @xmath57 on the electronic structure is also shown in fig . [ fig_2 ] ( for @xmath90 ) ; there are again fluctuations and avoided crossings .",
    "these features are similar for finite values of @xmath58 and @xmath9 ( not shown ) .",
    "the renormalization as a function of @xmath57 , however , is smaller than for @xmath9 due to the electrode geometry .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the electronic levels are sensitive to the environmental electric fields and different regimes can be identified depending on the strength of the electric coupling between levels .",
    "the novel effects are predicted to occur in realistic al / oxide transistors at the mev scale ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) that is readily accessible experimentally .",
    "we now discuss the fluctuations of the slopes using the calculated @xmath91 .",
    "table [ tab : table_1 ] shows the average value ( @xmath92 ) of the slopes @xmath60 , taken over @xmath93 consecutive levels distributed symmetrically with respect to @xmath78 , and the orthodox slope @xmath94 for comparison . @xmath92 for transistor @xmath83 is greater than for @xmath84 by a factor of @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath96 being @xmath97 times bigger in @xmath83 than in @xmath84 ( see table [ tab : table_1 ] ) and , consequently , more atomic sites being perturbed by the gate electric field .",
    "the standard deviation ( @xmath98 ) of @xmath99 is roughly _ equal _ ( @xmath100 ) for the two transistors .",
    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows the histograms for @xmath101 in units of @xmath94 .",
    "the _ microscopic _ slopes of the energy levels are clearly significant fractions of the _ macroscopic _ slope arising from the orthodox model . indeed , for @xmath84 the _ microscopic _ and the _ macroscopic _ effects are roughly equal .",
    "thus the microscopic effects of environmental fields on the electronic structure and tunneling resonances that we have derived here can be a _ very _ important correction to macroscopic effects predicted by standard orthodox theory .",
    "both distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] are nearly gaussian ( the smooth lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] are @xmath102}$ ] , @xmath103 is the bin size ) , as predicted from eq .",
    "( [ eq_slopes ] ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] shows @xmath104@xcite in units of @xmath105 .",
    "clearly , this effect is negligible when compared with @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , experimental measurements of @xmath106 can accurately determine @xmath107 and hence the microscopic effects of the environmental fields on the nanoisland energy levels ; see eq .",
    "( [ slopes ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have shown that coupling to environmental electric fields gives rise to a unique fingerprint of the electron wavefunction at the surface of a nanoscopic conductor that can be observed in tunneling experiments .",
    "while we illustrated this by considering al / al - oxide nanoislands our findings rely only on the ability of ultrasmall _ conducting _ islands to screen electric fields , and their large surface - to - volume ratio . therefore , other metallic nanoislands ( noble and magnetic ) and more exotic nanoscopic conductors such as metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite may also reveal the fingerprints of their electron wavefunctions .",
    "we hope our results will motivate experimentalists to look for these fingerprints .",
