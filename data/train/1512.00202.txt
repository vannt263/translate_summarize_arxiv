    "one paradigm in studies of quantum chaos is the kicked harper model  ( khm ) .",
    "it was originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to model a kicked charge in a magnetic field .",
    "later a whole class of generalized versions of khm were introduced , which may also be realized via a periodically kicked charge in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "remarkably , more than two decades ago , the khm was already used to study topological phase transitions in floquet states and to understand possible connections between large floquet band chern numbers , delocalization of floquet eigenstates , and the underlying classical chaos  @xcite .",
    "@xcite were perhaps the first two studies illuminating on topological phases of matter in periodically driven systems , a topic of wide interest at present due to the finding of floquet topological insulators  @xcite . studies of topological phase transitions in the khm opened up stimulating questions of interest to different communities , connecting concepts from different areas such as condensed matter physics and nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the relevance of the khm to studies of topological phases becomes even more evident in recent years .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the khm and a variant of another paradigm of quantum chaos , namely , the double - kicked rotor model  ( dkr ) , have a certain kind of topological equivalence though their spectrum has many distinctively different features  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the khm has drastically different edge states as compared with that associated with the dkr , even though all their bulk floquet bands have exactly the same chern numbers  @xcite .",
    "this result is useful for ongoing investigations of the issue of bulk - edge correspondence in floquet topological states as well as the issue of weak topological insulators .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite , we already showed that adding one periodic system parameter to the conventional khm hamiltonian can serve the purpose of introducing an artificial dimension , thus enabling us to study the properties of two - dimensional  ( @xmath3d ) systems from the perspective of one - dimensional  ( @xmath4d ) systems .",
    "it was found that the quasienergy spectrum of this effective @xmath3d khm is able to host as many @xmath3d dirac cones as possible at both quasienergy @xmath1 and quasienergy @xmath2 by simply increasing the kicking strength .",
    "this suggests that the khm might be a good platform to study gapless topological phases , such as weyl semimetal  @xcite and nodal line semimetal  @xcite in floquet systems .",
    "motivated by these results regarding the khm , in this paper we propose to study an extended khm by introducing two periodic system parameters into the hamiltonian . with two periodic system parameters available , together with the conserved quasimomentum variable due to the translational invariance in the sole physical  ( lattice ) dimension , it is possible to obtain floquet bands that can be effectively associated with three - dimensional  ( @xmath0d ) systems .",
    "this thus creates an interesting opportunity to explore the khm from a perspective related to @xmath0d gapless topological phases of matter , which has recently become an interesting topic  @xcite .    in order to make both periodic system parameters nontrivial",
    ", we propose to introduce modulations to both the lattice hopping term and the kicking potential in the khm .",
    "these modulations are characterized by two phase shift parameters playing the role of two periodic system parameters .",
    "the model hamiltonian can thus also be deemed as a kicked version of a recently proposed off - diagonal harper model  @xcite .",
    "having two periodic system parameters leads to one direct advantage in understanding the implications of various topological phases for the dynamics .",
    "specifically , it is now possible to execute adiabatic loops in the @xmath3d parameter space spanned by the two phase shift parameters , by directly and slowly tuning the two system parameters .",
    "therefore , even for a single quasimomentum component of the system , it is possible to realize closed adiabatic loops to manifest the topological phases .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a variety of interesting and motivating results for the simplest two - band case of the above - mentioned extended khm .",
    "first of all , we observe the emergence of isolated @xmath0d dirac cones  ( weyl points ) as well as line nodes  ( two bands touching along a line ) in the floquet bands , at quasienergies @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this strongly suggests that even @xmath4d driven systems can be useful to study @xmath0d floquet topological phases . in particular ,",
    "the emergence of weyl points and line nodes at quasienergy @xmath2 is a finding that is absent in static systems .",
    "secondly , by taking advantage of the simplicity of the two - band case , we also analytically show how it is possible to obtain as many weyl points and line nodes as possible in our extended khm .",
    "thirdly , when we take open boundary conditions  ( obc ) along the only physical dimension , we observe a line connecting two weyl points with opposite chiralities , which is analogues to the so - called fermi arc  @xcite in static weyl semimetal systems , at both quasienergies @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "fourthly , we also perform dynamics studies and demonstrate how the chirality of the ( floquet ) weyl points and the @xmath2 berry phase around the ( floquet ) line nodes can be manifested in the adiabatic dynamics of the system . by considering an adiabatic loop with an appropriate initial state in the @xmath3d parameter space enclosing a weyl point , its chirality can be captured .",
    "furthermore , by adiabatically driving a floquet eigenstate at a fixed quasimomentum over one adiabatic cycle , the @xmath2 berry phase can be observed .",
    "these results should be of experimental interest , especially for waveguide and optical lattice realizations of @xmath4d driven systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we start by describing the hamiltonian studied in this paper , which is referred to as the off - diagonal modulated kicked harper model  ( odkhm ) , and a possible experimental realization . by focusing on the situation where the floquet operator associated with this hamiltonian",
    "consists of only two bands , we analytically show the emergence of band touching points in a form of isolated weyl points or line nodes as the hopping strength and kicking strength are varied . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , we present numerically the emergence of localized edge states associated with the weyl points and line nodes by taking obc along the physical or artificial dimension of the system . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] a , we design an adiabatic pumping scheme surrounding a weyl point and show how its chirality can be captured by choosing an appropriate initial state .",
    "we further show that by using the same adiabatic pumping scheme and initial state , the chirality of weyl points at quasienergy @xmath1 and quasienergy @xmath2 are captured in different manners , which may suggest the distinction between the two types of weyl point . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] b , we also show a possible way to capture the @xmath2 berry phase of the line node by adiabatically pumping a floquet eigenstate at a fixed value of its quasimomentum .",

    "<S> recent discoveries on topological characterization of gapless systems have attracted interest in both theoretical studies and experimental realizations . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such gapless topological phases are weyl semimetals , which exhibit 3d dirac cones  ( weyl points ) , and nodal line semimetals , which are characterized by line nodes  ( two bands touching along a line ) . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by our previous discoveries that the kicked harper model exhibits many fascinating features of floquet topological phases , in this manuscript we consider a generalization of the model , where two additional periodic system parameters are introduced into the hamiltonian to serve as artificial dimensions , so as to simulate a @xmath0d system . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that by increasing the hopping strength and the kicking strength of the system , many new band touching points at floquet quasienergies @xmath1 and @xmath2 will start to appear . </S>",
    "<S> some of them are weyl points , while the others form line nodes in the parameter space . by taking open boundary conditions along the physical dimension , edge states analogues to fermi arcs in static weyl semimetal systems </S>",
    "<S> are observed . finally , by designing an adiabatic pumping scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the chirality of the weyl points and the @xmath2 berry phase around line nodes can be manifested . </S>"
