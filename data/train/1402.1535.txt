    "the indicative conditional is associated to the material implication , whereas the subjunctive construction of the language is traditionally studied by the philosophy as the counterfactual conditional@xcite or the counterfactual for short .",
    "conditional propositions involve two components , the antecedent and the consequent .",
    "counterfactual conditionals differ from material implication in a subtle way .",
    "the truth of a material implication is based on the actual state - of - affairs . from the knowledge that kennedy was killed , we can accept the truth of the phrase . on the other hand ,",
    "a counterfactual conditional should take into account the truth of the antecedent , even if it is not the case .",

    "the truth value of a counterfactual is considered within a minimal change generated by admitting the antecedent true@xcite .    a possible way to circumvent belief revision mechanisms",
    "is to consider alternative ( possible ) state - of - affairs , considered here as worlds , and , based on some accessibility notion , choose the closest one among the worlds that satisfy the antecedent . if the consequent is true at this considered world , then the counterfactual is also true@xcite .",
    "both conditionals have false antecedents and false consequents in the current state - of - affairs .",
    "however , the second conditional is clearly false , since we found no reason to accept that , in the closest worlds in which kennedy is not killed by oswald , kennedy is killed by someone else .",
    "we choose the approach of lewis@xcite in our attempt to formalize an inference system for counterfactuals because his accessibility relation leaves out the discussion for a general definition of similitude among worlds , which is considered as given in his analysis .",
    "it also opened the possibility for a contribution in the other way .",

    "but lewis gave no formal definition of similarity in his book@xcite .",
    "he defined two basic counterfactual conditional operators :    * @xmath2 : if it were the case that a , then it would be the case that b ; * @xmath3 : if it were the case that a , then it might be the case that b.    and provided also the definition of other counterfactual operators .",

    "he pointed out that the strictness of the counterfactual conditional is based on the similarity of worlds .",
