    "synchronization and cluster states in complex networks have been in the focus of intense research in physics , biology , neuroscience , and technology @xcite .",
    "the key question is how the properties of the individual elements , the type of the coupling , and the topology of connections determine the collective dynamics .",
    "a powerful technique to address this question is the master stability function ( msf ) formalism @xcite , which has been developed for smooth coupled dynamical systems to analyze full synchrony @xcite and cluster states with synchronized groups of elements @xcite . in various applications , however , non - smooth dynamical systems arise @xcite .",
    "examples include electronic circuits @xcite , hybrid control systems @xcite , and biological networks @xcite . specifically in neuroscience ,",
    "theoretical investigations of neuronal network activity often involve neuron models of the integrate - and - fire ( if ) type , which include a discontinuity and non - smooth models of synaptic couplings between them . if models are commonly used in computational studies of network activity @xcite , and form the hardware - elements of neuromorphic systems designed for spike - based , brain - style computations @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we develop an msf formalism for delay - coupled non - smooth dynamical systems , and we demonstrate its potential by studying synchrony and cluster states for recurrent networks of adaptive if model neurons .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 if neurons which are coupled by delayed synaptic currents .",
    "we choose the adaptive exponential integrate - and - fire ( aeif ) model @xcite , which is a two - variable neuron model that can well reproduce a variety of subthreshold dynamics and spike patterns observed in cortical neurons .",
    "the subthreshold dynamics of each aeif neuron is given by ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the membrane voltage , @xmath5 is the strength of the adaptation current , and @xmath6 is the strength of an effective synaptic ( output ) current .",
    "equation   effectively describes the change of the membrane voltage of each neuron in reaction to the ionic currents which flow through its membrane .",
    "five currents are taken into account ( eq .  , left to right ) : the leak current , the fast sodium current at spike initiation , an adaptation current , which reflects slowly varying , activity - dependent potassium currents , an external driving input @xmath7 , and the weighted sum of time - delayed synaptic input currents caused by the other neurons in the network with overall strength @xmath8 , weights @xmath9 , and delay @xmath10 .",
    "equation  , left , quantifies , how the strength of the adaptation current depends on the membrane potential , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the adaptation time constant .",
    "if a neuron is activated , the adaptation current increases , counteracting this activation .",
    "equation  , right , describes the dynamics of the synaptic current .",
    "the activation of a model synapse decays exponentially with relaxation time @xmath13 .",
    "when the membrane potential increases beyond a threshold value @xmath14 , an action potential ( spike ) is generated .",
    "if models do not describe the dynamics of the action potential explicitly .",
    "instead , the synaptic output current is incremented by 1 ( indicating the spike ) and the membrane potential is instantaneously reset to a lower value @xmath15 . for the aeif neuron ,",
    "the strength of the adaptation current is also changed after the spike has occurred .",
    "it is increased by a value of @xmath16 implementing the mechanism of spike - based adaptation .",
    "therefore , the aeif model takes two mechanisms for activity - based adaptation into account , both of which are common to real cortical neurons : a subthreshold mechanism , driven by the increase of the membrane potential , and a spike - based mechanism , which is activated every time a spike has occurred .",
    "it has been shown that subthreshold adaptation can induce synchrony for pairs of symmetrically coupled excitatory neurons @xcite and spike - dependent adaptation can cause networks to split up into phase locked clusters @xcite . here",
    "we examine under what conditions the two adaptation mechanisms can ( de)stabilize synchrony and different cluster states for a wide range of biologically plausible patterns of connections .",
    "the network of aeif model neurons , which we have introduced above , is a typical example of a network of non - smooth dynamical systems with time delays .",
    "these networks can be described in general by two sets of equations , one for the dynamics of the network elements between the discontinuities , @xmath17 and one for the jumps , @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is piecewise continuous and that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are differentiable vector functions .",
    "does not depend on @xmath26 in eq .  .",
    "the following derivation , however , can be extended to coupling functions @xmath27 in a straightforward way ] @xmath28 is a scalar - valued , differentiable function that indicates the occurrence of a discontinuity , and denotes a right - sided limit .",
    "we now extend the msf formalism to non - smooth dynamical systems as described by eqs .   and .",
    "we assume constant row sum of the coupling matrix , @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "then a zero - lag synchronous state exists , in which every element of the network evolves according to the same equation .",
    "we denote this solution by @xmath31 and the set of times at which @xmath31 changes discontinuously by @xmath32 .",
    "we next assess the stability of the fully synchronous solution @xmath31 by linearising eqs .",
    "and around @xmath31 . between the discontinuities at @xmath33 and the corresponding kinks of @xmath31 at @xmath34 , we obtain the variational equation @xmath35 \\underline{\\boldsymbol{\\xi } } + \\left [ \\mathbf{c } \\otimes d \\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{x}_{s,\\tau } ) \\right ] \\underline{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{\\tau } % d_{\\mathbf{x}^d } not used \\label{eq_variational_xi1}\\ ] ] for the perturbations @xmath36 from the synchronous solution ( cf .",

    " then leads to the master stability equations @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the normalized eigenvector of @xmath39 that corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath53 .",
    "hereby we separate the variational equation for perturbations in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath54 ) from those in the transverse directions .",
    "we can now calculate the largest lyapunov exponent for the solution @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which defines the msf . here",
    "we apply the numerical scheme proposed in @xcite to obtain the lyapunov exponents for eqs .  .",
    "let us first apply our msf formalism to a homogeneous population of coupled aeif neurons which are driven by a constant external input @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the result for six different sets of parameters .",
    "the three columns from left to right show the msf for networks with dominant excitatory couplings ( row sum @xmath58 ) , balanced excitation and inhibition ( @xmath59 ) , and dominant inhibitory couplings ( @xmath60 ) , respectively .",
    "the two rows show the msf for neurons whose subthreshold adaptation is weak ( top ) and strong ( bottom ) , respectively . if the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix lie within the unit circle ( highlighted by insets in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , stable zero - lag synchrony is predicted for excitation dominated networks of neurons with strong subthreshold adaptation and for inhibition dominated networks of neurons with weak subthreshold adaptation . an increase of spike - triggered adaptation ( larger @xmath61 ) on the other hand does not stabilize synchrony in excitation dominated networks ( not shown )",
    ". for balanced networks synchrony remains unstable independently of the choice of adaptation parameters , because there are negative and positive values of the largest lyapunov exponent in any small neighborhood of the origin . in summary",
    ", we identify neuronal adaptation , which in real cortex is under top - down control of the brain s neuromodulatory systems @xcite , as one of the key factors for stabilizing or destabilizing synchrony in recurrent networks .",
    "the msf provides general information about the stability of the synchronous state for many different coupling matrices .",
    "we now evaluate the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for two qualitatively different and biologically important classes of coupling matrices .",
    "for both classes , the homogeneous population of aeif neurons is split into two subpopulations which make excitatory ( @xmath62 ) and inhibitory ( @xmath63 ) connections only , cf .",
    "[ fig2]a . for one class of coupling matrices ( random ) the connections are otherwise random , i.e.",
    ", connections between any two neurons in the network are chosen with equal probability .",
    "for the other class of coupling matrices ( spatial maps ) neurons lie on a two - dimensional sheet and the connection probability between two neurons depends on the spatial distance between them .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b shows the results of the eigenvalue spectrum for the random connectivity scheme .",
    "one eigenvalue of the connection matrix is real and equal to the row sum @xmath64 .",
    "the other eigenvalues lie within a circle with radius @xmath65 centered at the origin of the eigenvalue plane @xcite .",
    "@xmath66 is the connection probability , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the number of neurons in the two different subpopulations and @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the excitatory and inhibitory coupling strengths , respectively .",
    "the curves separate the parameter regimes with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ fig2]c shows the corresponding results for the spatial map scheme , which were calculated numerically for both mexican hat ( range of excitatory couplings on average smaller than range of inhibitory couplings ) and inverse mexcian hat ( range of excitatory couplings on average larger than range of inhibitory couplings ) connection matrices .",
    "the maximum size of the eigenvalues depends on the absolute values of the coupling strengths .",
    "if they are not too strong , the eigenvalues of all three types of coupling matrices lie within the unit disc in the eigenvalue plane ( highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that if synchrony is stable in a random network with sparse couplings , it is also stable in a spatially structured network with local couplings only .",
    "this has interesting implications for network models of cortical areas , because it implies that the stability of synchrony in a model of a local cortical column can predict the stability of global synchronous activity in a model of a spatially structured cortical map and vice versa .",
    "complete synchronization in a large network is a special phenomenon .",
    "often cluster states emerge , for which the network splits into subgroups of elements that show isochronous synchrony internally , but there may be a phase lag or different dynamics between them @xcite .",
    "the stability of cluster states can also be analyzed using the msf formalism @xcite , which we now formulate for non - smooth dynamical systems .",
    "consider a network which consists of two groups ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) of elements which may differ in their local dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the connections of elements within and between the groups are given by the four coupling matrices @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , for which we assume unity row sum . the dynamics of the network is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the coupling strengths of the intra- and inter - group connections are scaled by factors @xmath82 , respectively . in order to simplify notation ,",
    "the propagation delay @xmath10 is assumed constant .    in a cluster state ,",
    "all elements which belong to a group of the network are synchronized and follow the same trajectory @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "trajectories of elements which belong to different groups , however , may be different .",
    "the variational equations for the perturbations from the synchronous solution , i.e. , the master stability equations , are then given by ( cf .",
    "eq .   for the homogenous case ) :",
    "@xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 . @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the eigenvalues of the block matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the variational equations - one for each group - must again be complemented by the linearized transition conditions ( cf .",
    " for the homogeneous case ) : @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 only depend on @xmath95 just before and after the discontinuity , see appendix ii .",
    "however , we have to require that the matrices @xmath96 and @xmath97 commute , because only then a common set of eigenvectors exists and the pairs @xmath98 of eigenvalues are well defined  @xcite . in order to assess the stability of a particular cluster state , the msf is then evaluated for those pairs .",
    "we apply our msf formalism to a network of aeif neurons , where the excitatory and the inhibitory subpopulations now have different local dynamics ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "the aeif neurons of the inhibitory subpopulation are weakly adaptive , and parameters are chosen such that they mimick the dynamics of the fast spiking inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex  @xcite .",
    "the aeif neurons of the excitatory subpopulation are strongly adaptive , and parameters are chosen such that they either mimick the dynamics of the pyramidal neurons in the neocortex ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , c , left and center ) or the dynamics of intrinsically bursting neurons ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , c , right ) , which - when activated - produce repeated events of rapid spiking .",
    "bursting dynamics is mediated by spike - based adaptation for neurons with an increased reset membrane potential @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3]c shows the msf for real eigenvalues @xmath99 of the intra- and inter - group coupling matrices . if connections are symmetric ( @xmath100 , @xmath80 ) and no autapses ( @xmath101 ) exist , the eigenvalues @xmath99 are real and lie within the unit square of the eigenvalue plane .",
    "( @xmath80 ) all have non - negative entries with unity row sum .",
    "excitatory and inhibitory interactions are generated via the overall coupling parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 the corresponding lyapunov exponents are all negative ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "however , they can become positive when subthreshold or spike - based adaptation for the excitatory neurons is decreased ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) , indicating a potential loss of stability for the particular cluster states .",
    "we conclude that the stability of many qualitatively different cluster states is controlled by neuronal adaptation : oscillatory activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with a phase lag between the two groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , c , left ) , inhibitory neurons spiking repetitively at a higher rate than excitatory neurons ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , c , center ) , and ( 3 ) bursting behavior ( fig .  [ fig3]b , c , right ) .",
    "these results hold for qualitatively different classes of coupling matrices : networks with constant all - to - all intra- and random ( but symmetric , @xmath104 ) inter - group connections , for example , show the same synchronization behavior as one - dimensional spatial networks with local ( symmetric ) connectivity ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "in summary , we have presented an msf formalism to study synchrony and cluster states in networks of non - smooth dynamical systems . using our formalism",
    "we have shown that neuronal adaptation controls the stability of such network states for many qualitatively different classes of coupling matrices .",
    "hence , our approach provides a powerful method to analyze biologically relevant dynamical states of typical cortical network models in a general setting .",
    "for example , it could be used to examine the stability of synchronous and clustered network states under influence of structural plasticity ( i.e. , activity - dependent changes of coupling strengths ) @xcite , irrespective of a specific coupling topology .",
    "another interesting application of our approach in neuroscience is pulsed brain stimulation , such as transcranial magnetic stimulation @xcite or deep brain stimulation @xcite , where our method could provide general results , e.g. , when using models of coupled neuronal populations and pulse - like forcing @xcite .",
    "our formalism is , however , not limited to the neuronal network level , but may be applied to a variety of diverse networks , e.g. , coupled eukaryotic model cells @xcite , hybrid models of genetic networks @xcite , electronic circuits such as networks of chua s circuits @xcite , hybrid switching systems in production technology @xcite , or delay - coupled semiconductor lasers with challenging perspectives towards reservoir computing @xcite .",
    "promising applications are also anticipated for networks of interacting oscillators in the context of cognitive processing @xcite . here",
