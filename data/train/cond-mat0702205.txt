    "the effect of spatial dissipation on the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite dynamics of a system is well understood . on a microscopic level",
    ", dissipation arises from bilinear coupling of the system coordinate to the displacement coordinates of a harmonic bath .",
    "classically the bath modes obey forced oscillator equations of motion , which may be solved formally in terms of the motion of the system .",
    "these are then inserted in the system equation of motion which then takes the form of a generalized langevin equation .    over twenty years ago , caldeira and leggett @xcite took advantage of this equivalence to study the effect of a dissipative bath on the quantum dynamics of the system , paying special attention to the quantum tunneling effect .",
    "their central conclusion was that dissipation reduces the tunneling probability , however , it does not destroy it completely .",
    "hence , the possibility of observing macroscopic quantum tunneling .    the detrimental effect of an interaction between the system and its environment on quantum phenomena makes intuitive sense .",
    "consider first the localization of a particle in space .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the position variance of a dissipative harmonic oscillator becomes smaller as the dissipation strength is increased . in the limit of very large ohmic friction , the bath can localize the particle completely , without violating the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the bath may be thought of as creating an effective particle with a very large mass , and such a heavy particle may be localized .",
    "one has a similar picture of how the environment destroys tunneling . for a dissipative parabolic barrier",
    ", it is well known that diagonalization of the system - bath hamiltonian leads to an unstable mode , whose frequency decreases as the coupling strength increases @xcite .",
    "tunneling occurs by transmission through this collective unstable mode . since its frequency is smaller , it is a broader barrier , the action needed to cross it increases and the tunneling probability decreases @xcite . the same qualitative picture holds at low temperatures below the crossover temperature separating the tunneling and activated barrier crossing regimes @xcite .",
    "spatial dissipation also reduces the crossover temperature @xcite , it is proportional to the collective mode barrier frequency .",
    "this lowering also fits in with the general observation that dissipation causes quantum systems to behave more like classical systems @xcite .",
    "all of these conclusions are based on the extensive study of the quantum dynamics of dissipative systems , where the hamiltonian can be brought to the form of bilinear coupling between the system and bath coordinates .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between this type of spatial dissipative coupling and bilinear momentum coupling of a system coupled to a bath @xcite .",
    "recently , makhnovskii and pollak @xcite have shown that bilinear momentum coupling leads to stochastic acceleration @xcite without any violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "in contrast to spatial coupling which effectively increases the mass of the system , momentum coupling reduces it and in the limit of an `` ohmic '' coupling , the effective mass goes to zero .",
    "hence , the system can undergo stochastic acceleration .",
    "this observation indicates that perhaps momentum coupling can lead to some rather anti - intuitive quantum mechanical results .",
    "if it reduces the effective mass , it should amplify quantum effects rather than destroy them .",
    "this is the topic of this paper .    in section",
    "ii we study the classical and quantum dynamics of a harmonic oscillator bilinearly coupled to the momentum of a harmonic bath . we find that as already noted in a different context by cuccoli et al @xcite , here too the effective mass is reduced such that increasing the momentum coupling increases the thermal variance of the position of the quantum particle instead of decreasing it . in section iii",
    "we study the dynamics of a parabolic barrier .",
    "momentum coupling increases the thermal flux of the particle across the barrier as compared to the thermal flux in the absence of coupling .",
    "most interestingly , the bath increases the magnitude of the normal mode parabolic barrier frequency , implying that it becomes thinner and therefore the tunneling flux through the barrier increases .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case both above and below the crossover temperature , which now increases with increasing coupling strength .",
    "we end in section iv with a summary .",
    "our model is that of a harmonic oscillator with mass weighted momentum @xmath0 , coordinate @xmath1 and harmonic frequency @xmath2 interacting bilinearly with a harmonic oscillator heat bath through the momentum @xcite .",

    "the @xmath7 s are the bilinear coupling coefficients to the particle s momentum .    before considering the dynamics of this hamiltonian , it is appropriate to put it into the context of previous studies of dissipative systems .",
    "the coupling of the system to the bath through the momentum of the bath has been studied previously in a variety of contexts . in an early paper ,",
    "leggett @xcite considered the possibility of two coupling terms , taking the form @xmath8 .",
    "he then distinguishes between _ normal _ dissipation , where the langevin equation of motion is derived for the spatial system coordinate @xmath1 and _ anomalous _ dissipation , where the langevin equation of motion is derived for the spatial system momentum .",
    "neither of these describe the model hamiltonian given in eq . [ 2.1 ] above . in our model",
    ", the coupling term has the form @xmath9 , leading to qualitatively different dynamics .",
    "a different model has been considered by ford et al @xcite . in their case",
    "the coupling to the bath takes the quadratic form @xmath10 .",
    "it describes the physics of black body radiation in which the momentum of the particle is coupled to the magnetic field of the vacuum radiation .",
    "such coupling also differs from that given in eq . [",
    "the counter term appearing in the model of ford et al causes a coupling between the bath modes themselves and allows by a change of variables @xcite to recast the problem into one which is equivalent in form to the standard dissipative hamiltonian studied in detail in refs .",

    "@xcite and only exploits fundamental principles of quantum statistical mechanics .",

    "when using ( ii ) one has to take into account that according to ( [ 2.3 ] ) and in contrast to spatial friction the time derivative of @xmath72 is not identical to @xmath0 .",
    "hence , to apply the fluctuation dissipation theorem we do not start from the equation of motion in position ( [ 2.5 ] ) , but from the corresponding expression in momentum , i.e. , @xmath73and calculate according to ( i ) the classical response @xmath74 to an external force @xmath75 applied for @xmath76 . in fourier space",

    "this means though , that all findings known for spatial friction and e.g.  ohmic damping can be directly translated to momentum friction .",
    "we will discuss explicit results in the next section .      to obtain a feeling for the various results presented in this section it is worthwhile to consider the specific case of a momentum density with a cutoff:@xmath97 where @xmath98 is the heaviside function .",
    "one then finds that the laplace transform of the momentum function is@xmath99\\]]and the mass factor @xmath100explicitly demonstrating that in the limit that the cutoff frequency goes to infinity , the effective mass goes to zero .",
    "now , let us first look at the friction dependence of the laplace transform @xmath101 which directly provides the momentum variance and the functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "in contrast to @xmath102 which displays only classical dynamics , @xmath103 contains an additional contribution depending on the matsubara frequencies that becomes relevant at lower temperatures . in the limit of zero temperature @xmath103",
    "then decays in time no longer exponentially but algebraically @xmath116 .",
    "further in the limit of zero temperature one has for the momentum variance @xmath117 in essence , momentum friction gives for momentum correlations the same results as spatial coupling for position correlations .",
    "the same is true when the ratios @xmath118 , @xmath119 decrease , but are still large , and one compares momentum friction with @xmath120 with the well - known drude model for spatial friction , @xmath121 , with @xmath122 .",

    "one thus notes that the role of the momentum and position variances are interchanged when considering the momentum coupling model .    in fig .",
    "[ fignew1 ] the position and momentum variances are shown for momentum coupling with the spectral density ( [ spectral ] ) together with spatial coupling with a drude spectral density , @xmath130 . note that the latter one is , apart from its widespread use , a sort of minimal model for spatial friction leading to well - behaved variances . in case of momentum coupling the spectral density ( [ spectral ] )",
    "plays a similar role .",

    "they differ though in the low temperature range for the variances @xmath132 , @xmath133 , which are only well - behaved for finite cutoff .",
    "of course , when for spatial friction a spectral density is taken that produces the same damping dependence in the response function as the one given by ( [ spectral ] ) , we would obtain fully identical results .",
    "accordingly , position variances are enhanced for momentum coupling and suppressed for spatial coupling and vice versa for the momentum variances .",
    "one also observes that at low temperatures the momentum variance for momentum friction is suppressed compared to the position variance for spatial friction within a drude model [ see ( [ q2zero ] ) ] .",
    "accordingly , the uncertainty product for @xmath134 @xmath135 is smaller compared to the spatial case ( drude damping ) by the factor @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "we first consider the case of a parabolic barrier hamiltonian:@xmath137 .",

    "this is proof that classically , momentum coupling leads to an increase of the thermal parabolic barrier crossing rate , as compared with the absence of coupling .",

    "in contrast to the spatial coupling case , here the transmission factor tends to unity both in the weak and strong momentum coupling limits .",
    "given the fact that momentum coupling causes a decrease in the barrier width , it is interesting to study whether it could then cause an increase in the tunneling probability , since the tunneling probability is exponentially sensitive to the width of the barrier .",

    "<S> we find that the position and momentum variances for momentum coupling are respectively identical to momentum and position variances for spatial friction . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that momentum coupling leads to an increase in the fluctuations in position as the temperature is lowered , exactly the opposite of the classical like localization of the oscillator , found with spatial friction . for a parabolic barrier </S>",
    "<S> , momentum coupling causes an _ increase _ in the unstable normal mode barrier frequency , as compared to the lowering of the barrier frequency in the presence of purely spatial coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this increase in the frequency leads to an enhancement of the thermal tunneling flux , which below the crossover temperature becomes exponentially large . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover temperature between tunneling and thermal activation _ increases _ with momentum friction so that quantum effects in the escape are relevant at higher temperatures . </S>"
