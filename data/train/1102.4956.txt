    "the faint pattern of cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) polarization promises to provide new and interesting information on the universe .",
    "the primary goal of cmb polarization studies in the next decade is to detect the degree - scale @xmath2-modes  ( curl components ) induced by primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the existence of the primordial gravitational waves is a generic prediction of inflation .",
    "therefore the detection of the @xmath2-modes is a `` smoking - gun '' signature of inflation  @xcite .",
    "using an array with @xmath3 of polarization detectors ( hereafter polarimeters ) is essential to discover the @xmath2-modes  @xcite . for the next - generation experiments with such a large polarimeter array , establishing",
    "the performance of the detectors in the laboratory is essential to prepare for observations in the field .",
    "our system aims to calibrate three important properties ; responsivity , orientation of detector polarization angle and spurious polarization signal in the instrument .",
    "the calibration of these parameters requires a well - characterized artificial polarization signal .",
    "the combination of an unpolarized cold load ( blackbody absorber ) and a metal mirror at room temperature is one of the main approaches  @xcite to obtain such a signal .",
    "the temperature difference between the cold load and the mirror creates a well - characterized polarization signal , @xmath0  mk ( details are discussed in sec .  [ chap : principle ] ) . in the laboratory",
    ", the blackbody absorber tends to be cooled with liquid nitrogen  ( @xmath4  k ) .",
    "however , the large difference between this temperature and that of the sky at the observing site ( @xmath5  k , for example the atacama desert of northern chile at an altitude of @xmath1  5000  m ) makes it difficult to characterize the polarimeters in the laboratory .",
    "this is particularly true for detectors with a narrow range of linear response to input load temperature .    to address these issues ,",
    "we propose an advanced approach for polarimeter calibration .",
    "our method is an extension of the metal mirror rotation approach  @xcite , however it employs cryogenically - cooled blackbody absorbers instead of the absorbers cooled with liquid nitrogen .",
    "this system provides in the laboratory a load condition similar to the actual observation .",
    "cc    the principle for generating the polarization signal is the same as the conventional method  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : schem2 ] shows a schematic view of the developed calibrator system .",
    "the blackbody emitters are cooled with a cryocooler as the cold load with temperature of @xmath6 .",
    "unpolarized blackbody radiation is emitted from the cold load ; it reflects off a metal mirror surface , which induces a linearly polarized component because of the finite emissivity of the mirror .",
    "the magnitude of the polarization signal ( @xmath7 ) can be calculated using the following formula , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the frequency of observed radiation , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the temperature and resistivity of the mirror , @xmath12 is the reflection angle of the radiation , and @xmath13 is the vacuum permittivity .",

    "we can control the signal magnitude by changing @xmath11 as well as changing the temperature difference , @xmath18 .",
    "the linear polarization is characterized by two stokes parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "since the value of stokes parameters depends on the bases of the selected coordinate system , the ability to rotate the axis of the polarization signal is essential to calibrate the polarimeter responses unless we calibrate the orientation of the polarization angle for the stokes parameters .",
    "moreover , the baseline of the polarimeter response fluctuates due to a @xmath21 noise . to measure the response for the polarization correctly",
    ", we have to modulate the polarization signal by rotating the mirror ; the parallactic angle of the signal axis with respect to the polarimeter varies with the rotation angle of the mirror ( @xmath22 ) . for example , assuming the axis for the @xmath19 response of the polarimeter aligns with the orientation of @xmath22 = 0 , the @xmath19 response varies with @xmath23 , and the @xmath20 response varies with @xmath24  @xmath25",
    ". we can characterize the responsivity ; signal height with respect to the input polarization signal , and the polarization angle ; orientation angle of the polarization axis from the amplitude and the phase of the sinusoidal response of the polarimeter , respectively .",
    "we are also interested in the spurious polarization of the polarimeter with respect to the total power which is usually dominated by unpolarized temperature .",
    "this is called @xmath26 to @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) leakage where the total power is described with stokes @xmath26 parameter .",
    "the actual polarization response for @xmath19 is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the leakage parameter since @xmath26 is dominated by @xmath6 in most cases , we can measure the leakage parameter for the polarimeter by changing the @xmath6  @xcite . with the two different temperature loads of 10  k and 30  k ,",
    "we observe a 1  k baseline difference in the polarization response for @xmath29 .",
    "the polarimeter can also measure the unpolarized temperature response for @xmath26 as well as for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we calibrate the response for @xmath26 by using two different @xmath6  s ( the y - factor measurement ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : response ] shows the amplitude of the polarized signal for three different mirror materials .",
    "the results show that the amplitudes are proportional to the square root of the resistivity as expected , and the system has no inherent polarized signal within the precision of the measurement .",
    "this is the evidence that there is no bias for the polarization responsivity measurement by using the single mirror setup .",

    "the technique is a simple extension of the conventional rotation metal plate approach , however , it employs @xmath110  k cold loads which correspond to the sky temperature at the cmb observation site on the ground ( the atacama desert of northern chile at an altitude of @xmath1 5000  m ) . the calibrator can provide a well - characterized polarization signal ( @xmath51  mk ) which can be modulated by rotation of a mirror . using a quiet polarimeter , we demonstrated simultaneous measurements of the responsivity , orientation of polarization angle , and spurious polarization signal in the instrument with sufficient precision .",
    "these three parameters are keys to the success of @xmath2-mode observations as well as sensitivity  ( noise equivalent temperature : @xmath67 ) of the polarimeter .",
    "our system also provides a way to measure noise properties under a comparable load temperature condition to the observing site .",
    "the estimation based on our system is thus more `` reliable '' than that obtained using a 77  k load cooled with liquid nitrogen .",
    "our system can easily be extended for large detector arrays by scaling up the size of the system .",
    "the precision of the laboratory - based calibration is comparable with the astronomical source calibrations at the observation site .",
    "this system can establish the polarimeter performance before deployment , which is important for experiments with large detector arrays .",
    "moreover , the precision of calibrations using astronomical sources is limited by the beam profile uncertainty .",
    "our system is free from this effect because of the wide coverage - angle of the loads .",
    "we have already eliminated it to less than 1% for the quiet polarimeter .    we have confirmed that our system works as designed .",
    "it will be very useful for the next - generation cmb polarization experiments . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrated the performance of the system using a polarimeter based on coherent amplifiers . by using a different configuration ,",
    "e.g. a setup in which the reflected emission on the mirror goes outside the cryostat , it is possible to use the system as an external polarized source for a polarimeter with different technology such as a bolometer . with a larger - capacity cryocooler , the system can also be extended to 3  k load temperatures .",
