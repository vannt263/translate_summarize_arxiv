    "results for the a complete set of source equations is not contained herein but some of the initial problems are addressed .",
    "the usual methods of developing field equations are not effective for this type of construction and are counterindicated by the considerations of  @xcite .",
    "the standard methods fail and more elementary arguments are used to guide the developments .",
    "progress is slow because the basic equations must be found by physical principles , such as equivalence , or by the mathematical study of limiting forms of the curvature tensor .",
    "it is a process of discovery in elementary geometrical systems .",
    "the issue of the particle mass is crucial and some of the characteristic roles are resolved in a synthesis that includes quantum effects .",
    "the mass as a constant must be introduced in a way that is compatible with the characteristic properties of all fields .",
    "one would wish to develop , as in the weyl theory  @xcite , a klein - gordon equation  @xcite in some form .",
    "some guidance is available as there are various theories in the literature  @xcite that apply in an approximation or in a limiting case .",
    "particle motion as discussed in the preceding paper  @xcite `` quantum geodesics '' , ( qg ) has not been assigned a particular particle mass .",
    "this defect is to be remedied here .",
    "five dimensional field equations are developed in which the mass appears as a measure of inertia .",
    "an appropriate construction is suggested by a version of the weyl theory .",
    "an identified relationship with quantum phenomenology has been known for some time .",
    "these associations provide a way to identify quantum structures in other types of geometry . to do this ,",
    "the weyl theory is reviewed and rewritten in a form that is appropriate .",
    "this is applied to riemannian theories and in five dimensions , the field equations can be combined with the geodesics of the previous article .",
    "although the mathematics of weyl s theory has been known since 1918 , the physical interpretation has been in dispute .",
    "any non - riemannian geometry can be interpreted as a modification to the derivatives as they are applied microscopically to particle motion .",

    "the effect of a displacement around a closed loop can be used to define a more general riemann tensor . @xmath8 with the definition @xmath9    with the implied complex factors in the connections given buy  ( [ nrcc ] ) and  ( [ wegu ] ) , the usual non - integrable part of the weyl displacement is associated with the phase .",
    "the part of weyl s connections which would affect the scale of @xmath10 are integrable . for this real conformal factor , and in this gauge , einsteins s objection to weyl s theory does not hold  @xcite .",
    "the integrable part of the length change seems to be mathematically related to the gravitational red shift , although the quantum interpretation is not equivalent to the original weyl interpretation .",
    "there are a number of theories that study invariance under conformal transformations  @xcite .",
    "this point of view may apply in the classical limit .",
    "the quantum geometrical system used here departs from this interpretation and supports well defined physical meanings for microscopic conformal transformations .",
    "invariance under conformal transformations , especially in classical theories , is identified as a means to suppress the intrinsic quantum terms .",
    "conformal transformations of the four metric can be identified with variations of probability density .",
    "this applies to single particle states .",
    "consider an observer s space that , for the argument , is flat and euclidean .",

    "the predicted probability density , @xmath14 , is taken as the first component of the quantum conserved current density .",
    "let the particle be described by the metric @xmath10 , which varies from the observers metric @xmath15 by a point conformal transformation , @xmath16 .",
    "the number of particles in the region , as determined by the neutral observer is given by @xmath17 of course the geodesics of @xmath10 are not straight in the observers frame , but in a very small region where both coordinate systems are flat , they can be chosen euclidean and parallel .",
    "the fixed volume @xmath18 has new dimensions @xmath19 while the number of counts stays constant .",
    "the time dependence of the derivative under conformal transformation must be compensated in the same way as the spatial coordinates .",
    "the implied relation between @xmath10 and @xmath6 during a gauge transformation can be used to show that the number of counts in a fixed region is constant . transforming @xmath20 @xmath21",
    "it follows that @xmath22 of special interest is that if for a given solution @xmath6 , the value of @xmath23 is chosen equal to the value of @xmath24 then after the gauge of @xmath25 is changed to @xmath26 , the magnitude of the wave function is forced to a constant over the whole space .",
    "probability density information can be transferred to the metric .",
    "the observable quantities are invariant although the magnitude of the wave function has been transformed away and is no longer an independent field .",
    "the field equations of quantum mechanics can be made part of this geometrical structure .",
    "it is easiest to first consider a four dimensional example that ignores electrodynamics . for this relatively simple geometry ,",
    "the klein - gordon equation can be identified with a modified type of curvature scalar . to do this ,",
    "geometrical invariants may be formed from the two metrics and derived tensors .",
    "an appropriate scalar is formed by using the tensor @xmath27 calculated from @xmath10 and contracting it with the inverse of the observer s metric , @xmath28 .",
    "this imposes a external length standard on the quantum equations that is based on the observer s frame .",
    "it also implies that phenomenological measurements performed to determine the observer s metric , @xmath15 must be made in a way that is consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , the clocks must all be based on fundamental quantum processes .",
    "direct calculation gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath15 still assumed euclidean .",
    "this means that the identification @xmath31 is equivalent to the klein - gordon equation @xmath32 the field equation for @xmath6 is demonstrated to be part of the geometry along with the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "thus , single particle relativistic quantum mechanics , can be described by the distortions of a kind of space - time .",
    "a larger system is needed to include a complex wave function and practical interactions .",
    "in particular the five dimensional theory , helps resolve some of the problems . to develop a usefulinterpretation",
    ", the weyl theory must be rewritten without an explicit wave function . to do this ,",
    "the gauges must be adjusted . starting with some combination @xmath6 , @xmath33 and @xmath10 ,",
    "the gauge is transformed so that @xmath6 is equal to unity everywhere . at the same time",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath10 are kept real .",
    "this leaves the metric unique up to a constant multiplicative factor and the vector potential completely specified .",
    "these new field variables , @xmath10 and @xmath33 are applicable to other types of geometrical theories . in the case",

    "the interpretational problems , the trajectories are geodesics for a complex path parameter .",
    "the difficulties of defining geodetic motion for non - integrable @xmath33 are relieved in the five dimensional theories .",
    "the significant mathematical quantities are more accessible .",
    "the imaginary parts that naturally appear in the weyl theory are often related to the variation with proper time rather than with coordinate time . because the fifth signature element in the five metric is of sign opposite to that for the coordinate time",
    ", this dependency can appear with the factor @xmath35 .",
    "the problems of changing the integrability of the vector potential is not easily resolved in a weyl theory .",
    "the additional transformations involving @xmath36 must be considered point transformations that may not leave physical quantities invariant . the effect on a weyl connection",
    "can be calculated in a way that is similar to the construction in  @xcite .",
    "if it is applied to the four dimensional neutral space connections , the weyl connection is generated .",
    "the electromagnetic term in the weyl connection can be thought of as generated by derivatives with respect to @xmath36 which persist after a series of conformal and cut transformations .",
    "the terms in @xmath37 are multiplied by the quantity @xmath38 which produces the imaginary factor .",

    "the coefficients in @xmath37 are multiplied by the quantity @xmath38 .",
    "if a conformal transformation is included , an electromagnetic field is generated .",
    "the weyl theory can be thought of as a study of conformal waves in which the five dimensional coordinate transformations generate apparent non - riemannian effects . in this context",
    ", the weyl theories are a phenomenological expression of higher geometries .",
    "calculation of the analogous invariant @xmath39 using the full connection  ( [ nrcc ] ) includes additional terms in the vector potential and metric .",
    "these reduce to the usual klein - gordon equation as shown in @xcite .",
    "these identified quantum - weyl field equations can be rewritten by recalculating from the invariant  ( [ winkg ] ) . keeping @xmath23 explicit ,",
    "the contraction of the metric tensor is first written : @xmath40    calculation of the `` pure '' invariant @xmath41 follows from equation  ( [ wrcc ] ) ,  ( [ nrcc ] ) , and  ( [ wegu ] ) .",
    "the weyl curvature can be computed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the riemannian tensor of the undotted metric @xmath10 and @xmath44 is the non - riemannian covariant derivative of the tensor @xmath0 with respect to the full connection @xmath45 . continuing with @xmath46 and the derived expression @xmath47 used to eliminate terms in @xmath48 , there results @xmath49    the contraction with respect to first and third indices is @xmath50 and contracting with the undotted inverse , @xmath51 , gives @xmath52 reduction of the weyl derivative can be made by @xmath53 which comes from equations  ( [ socd ] ) ,  ( [ nrcc ] ) , and  ( [ wegu ] ) and gives @xmath54 the semicolon denotes the riemannian covariant derivative using the undotted christoffel symbols .",
    "it is necessary to eliminate the undotted metric in favor of the observers dotted metric and the conformal ratio @xmath23 .",
    "the fundamental quantity for the electromagnetic field is @xmath34 with the index lowered .",
    "the index of @xmath34 in equation  ( [ gkge ] ) has been raised with the undotted metric .",
    "the conventional physical quantity is actually @xmath55    the curvature scalar @xmath56 of the dotted metric can be related to the curvature scalar @xmath57 of the undotted metric by a calculation entirely analogous to those already done .",
    "the complete expression becomes @xmath58 since @xmath59 is pure imaginary in this gauge , the linear term separates and after substituting for @xmath59 with @xmath60 , there results two real equations : @xmath61 and @xmath62    the first of these expresses the conservation of the quantum probability current as a congruence of trajectories . in the second equation , the left side includes all classical terms from the hamilton - jacobi equation for a general relativistic particle in an electromagnetic field .",
    "this can be seen by reversing the gauge transformations and identifying the wave function with the action by @xmath63 .",
    "the classical limit corresponds to neglecting derivatives of the magnitude of the wave function .",
    "the terms on the right side represent curvature corrections due to either the riemannian curvature of the observer s space or the quantum curvature derived from the conformal ratio @xmath23 .",
    "the conformal contributions to the curvature create the expected quantum effects .",
    "note that equations  ( [ gcpc ] ) and  ( [ wkgr ] ) are entirely real and do not contain any explicit reference to the wave function @xmath6 .",
    "this form is useful because many previous five dimensional theories  @xcite are known that have two real fields @xmath33 and @xmath10 .",
    "an attempt can be made to quantize some of these by the substitution of the fixed gauge fields .",
    "this process often seems to generate quantum terms and interpretations . in other cases",
    "it is completely unworkable .",
    "however , an approach of this type to first quantization avoids the serious problems that have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "it is now essential to understand how the conformal factors developed in ( qg ) can be used to form a field equation .",
    "only the most elementary arguments are available because the standard methods that use lagrangians fail .",
    "moreover the conformal factors do not have any established interpretations .",
    "the characteristic equations that contains these factors are studied and then interpreted according to physical principles or experiments .",
    "it is by way of the quantum field equation that the mass must be introduced .",
    "this external constant characterizes wave aspects of particle motion",
    ". the introduction of the associated length scales must be compatible with the scale sizes of other physical effects .",
    "boundaries , slits and shutters are scaled according to the masses of the particles of which they are made .",
    "electromagnetic and gravitational source currents are scale sensitive and require particles at measured positions . the extrinsic nature of mass is even suggested by particle creation .",
    "it is known that free space electromagnetic theory is invariant under conformal gauge change and can contain no intrinsic scale size . scale dependence can enter only through the source terms .",
    "thus any distance dependency found in electrodynamics must derive ultimately from the intrinsic scale sizes of quantum source currents and must be related to the masses of the source particles .",
    "if the electric source equations can be combined with the quantum field equations in a geometrical theory , the electric interaction constant becomes geometrical and should have a geometrical interpretation .",
    "this allows the conversion of @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "it may or may not be calculable , but one can anticipate that some theories will have favored values .",
    "complex wave functions are used in the accepted description of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "they can be used legitimately in a geometrical theory in so far as the phase and amplitude are combined into a linear wave equation . and",
    "while the quantum geodesics are completely real , it seems reasonable to allow the use of complex quantities in the search for fundamental invariants  @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach is not assured , but if it happens that such equations are identified , rearrangements to a real theory should be possible .    following ( qg ) , source currents manifest their effects on the metric through the conformal factors . in constructing a theory of interaction , the three factors @xmath66 must depend on either the test particle wave function @xmath67 or on one or more source wave functions @xmath68 .",
    "it is by no means obvious which combinations of fields @xmath69 are important in giving values to each of @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "various geometrical quantities must be evaluated and compared with known quantum equations .",
    "since none of these factors affect the congruence of a specific quantum state , the physical meaning must be inferred from the effect that they have on the field equations .",
    "the motion , as described by a particular congruence , may be explained by different combinations of source currents .",
    "a simple form for interactions should be obtained by allowing the source currents to affect the five metric through the conformal factors .",
    "a number of conformally covariant theories have used the factors @xmath72 and @xmath71 , in addition to @xmath23 .",
    "these quantities should all be identified with the physics of interaction . applied as contact transformations ,",
    "the effect is to change the five - gauge of @xmath73 , the one - gauge of the fifth dimension @xmath36 or the four - gauge of @xmath10 .",
    "this includes , implicitly , the integrating factor ( or dis - integrating factor ) of the vector potential .",
    "a preliminary investigation @xmath72 shows that it may generate five - covariant interactions . if , following reference  @xcite , the metric is conformally transformed , so that the new riemann tensor is @xmath74 then the new curvature is @xmath75\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the ricci tensor @xmath76 is given by @xmath77.\\ ] ]    if the lowest order dependence , perhaps as expressed in a local euclidean region , is exponential , possibly of the form @xmath78 , the lowest order linear terms in velocity occur in the @xmath79 positions and the quadratic terms in the @xmath80 positions .",
    "the additivity is correct for the source terms of classical equations",
    ". a product of external factors @xmath81 will have linear additivity with @xmath79 terms of the form @xmath82 .",
    "this is appropriate for electromagnetic source currents .",
    "the quadratic additivity of the @xmath83 terms will be of the form @xmath84 which is appropriate for gravitational effects .",
    "this suggests that , at least in the classical limit , @xmath85 must be part of the source current .",
    "probably in the quantum limit , it must also be some part of the quantum source current .",
    "this is apparently a primitive type of interaction .",
    "the internal conformal factors may also participate but may reduce the invariance to four dimensions .",
    "the association of these factors with real source currents is still under study",
    ". a full understanding should give a quantum version of the maxwell - einstein equations .",
    "a prerequisite to such a derivation will require an understanding of how to interpret the coherent quantum terms geometrically . because , for this formalism , there is no classical foundation , the problem of quantum understanding must be addressed first .",
    "the source currents are postponed and the quantum field equations are taken up instead .",
    "it seems reasonable to attempt to construct a quantum equation in five space from an assumption about geometrical invariants  @xcite .",
    "since the coordinate @xmath36 is not accessible , there is no direct way to observe the actual system @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , there is some indication of the importance of this formal coordinate .",
    "it is that the collection of _ non - inertial _",
    "systems that transform among themselves by a cut transformation remain physically equivalent until @xmath36 becomes a universal coordinate .",
    "otherwise stated , defining a fixed @xmath36 coordinate specifies a particular gauge and the associated motion for each particle .",
    "this specification represents the beginning of a systemwide inertial structure .",
    "a similar idea has been identified by schouten  @xcite .",
    "it is in practice the ratio of rest masses , that can be measured by quantum diffraction .",
    "one should therefore demand a theory for which individual particles have constant rest mass ratios at points taken where trajectories intersect .",
    "given any two distinct particles , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , whose trajectories intersect at a set of points .",
    "@xmath89 , then there must be a way to arrange the theory so that they have equal effective mass ratios .",
    "@xmath90 such unvarying mass ratios of discreet particles measured quantum mechanically is taken as an experimental fact . to reproduce this observation with an extrinsic definition of mass , the properties of each of the two particles",
    "must be referred to a common geometrical system .",
    "the neutral observer must be able to choose the rest masses of particles so that they will not vary over space - time . otherwise the clocks can not be systematically calibrated . in so far",
    "as the neutral observer can uniformly calibrate a system of quantum clocks , the absolute mass of a particle can become a viable global concept .",
    "the concepts of mass and quantum time come together consistently if the particle fields have a proper time dependence that appears always through the product combination @xmath91 .",
    "now while the @xmath36 coordinate must be universal , the fields observed in neutral space - time must also be @xmath36 independent . for five dimensional invariance , field equations containing",
    "@xmath36 derivatives are unavoidable .",
    "these derivatives must operate on some residual @xmath36 dependence which is then replaced by factors of @xmath92 .",
    "this departs from klein s assumption of the charge as an eigenvalue  @xcite and does not support a sequence of quantized values for the charge .",
    "qualitatively , one expects a klein - gordon equation to appear as @xmath93 with @xmath94 where the factor @xmath95 applies only in a coordinate system that has a fixed preferred alignment to the observers neutral frame .",
    "the introduction of the mass reduces the five dimensional dispersion free form and creates quantum dispersion  @xcite .",
    "this reduction is essential and ultimately produces classical inertia .",
    "once this is done , the cut transformations as an arbitrary coordinate transformation must be relinquished as it will cause contact variations of physical parameters .    in this way",
    ", the constancy of the mass ratios at each point , can be assured from the requirement of using a single fifth coordinate axis for all particles .",
    "the universality of the five space also is inferred . by using a real particle for the construction of clocks , and by choosing a fixed numerical value of the mass ,",
    "a uniform quantum clock is generated . at this point ,",
    "coordinate transformations that affect the scale size of the fifth coordinate axis correspond to a continuous rescaling of all masses ( rather than individual masses ) over space - time .",
    "the quantum behavior references the fifth dimension , which must be assumed common .",
    "from this construction in five dimensions it is seen that the mass spectrum consists of a single value .",
    "a more complicated spectrum , might come from other geometries .",
    "the elementary particles have distinct masses but they are also all distinguished by additional interactions .",
    "perhaps a geometrical theory that includes such fundamental interactions will produce a more realistic mass spectrum .",
    "since the mass appears here as a property that is extrinsic to the particle , calculation of the mass from a field equation is possible in principle .",
    "the conformal waves can now be calculated for other cases .",
    "an equivalent structure should occur in five dimensions .",
    "let a metric in @xmath96 dimensional space be of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a unit diagonal tensor and @xmath72 is a manifold variable conformal factor .",

    "at least three metrical structures are needed . in addition , the known allowed solutions for two particles without background interactions are restricted  @xcite .",
    "additional distant interacting particles , that participate in the quantum - gravitational - electrodynamic boundary conditions , may be important , at least to generate the equivalent of free fields .",
    "the problem is related to the arguments of renninger  @xcite .",

    "since the quantum structure must be introduced integrally , other possibilities may not be available .    the mathematical differences between this theory and the conventional ones may allow new predictions for quantum electrodynamics .",
    "few such effects are expected to be observable in the laboratory .",

    "it is necessary to argue physically that the accepted quantum - maxwell equations are adequate .",
    "never the less , it is easy to see that once the form of the electromagnetic interactions is chosen to give the correct results for common electromagnetic experiments , the photon correlations will be predicted correctly . because any motion , possibly even non - inertial , can be described by a five - coordinate transformation",

    "this embedment is not the same as the usual general relativistic problem of embedding  @xcite because only one quantum state is embedded at a time .",
    "the conventional approach seeks to embed the entire classical dynamics at each point .",

    "the quantum case , as approached by the geometrical method , is much simpler because at each point the congruence has only one direction and magnitude .",
    "each velocity at each given point is part of a different physical problem . for changed boundary or initial conditions ,",
    "new fields are chosen and a new embedding calculation is to performed .",
    "it is in part because of this simplification that an _ elementary _ five dimensional theory of interaction may be possible .",
    "it is expected that the external invariant klein - gordon equation applies as a primitive constraint on the motion of the test particle while the internal four dimensional equation is to be applied to the source particles as a condition on the description of the source current .",
    "the condition that the source terms have the proper dependence on the wave function means that the two interpretations of @xmath6 , as either an electric source current or as a probability density can be identified with each other .",
    "it is this equality that allows the definition of the electric charge . for the primitive geometrical maxwell s equations ,",
    "the concept of stream electricity must be used  @xcite which has the interpretation here of mutually interpenetrating geometrical congruences .",
    "the exact relation of the internal and external klein - gordon equations must be part of an interaction theory .",

    "that is , while it is technically possible to describe particles as moving points on trajectories , the experimental elucidation of those trajectories is not possible . for a true , physically detectable , hidden variable theory",
    ", one would imagine that the unity of the congruence is broken and that separate parts of it could interact with different observers .",
    "that this is not the case is manifested by having the interacting fields depend on source currents represented only as complete congruences without identified specific trajectories .",
    "other forms of interaction could conceivably destroy the particle quantum coherence .",
    "there is no experimental evidence for such a failure of this `` stream electricity '' .",

    "unfortunately , the extended principle of equivalence plus the concept of implicit quantization means that quantum mechanics can not readily be separated from this electrodynamics .",
