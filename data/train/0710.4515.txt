    "<S> we have identified lines in uv and optical spectra and conclude that it is significantly hotter than previously thought , namely @xmath0  k instead of 120000  k. this is a possible explanation for the observed hard x - ray emission as being of photospheric origin . concerning its evolutionary state , we suggest that kpd0005 + 5106 is not a descendant of a pg1159 star but more probably related to the o(he ) stars and rcrb stars . </S>"
