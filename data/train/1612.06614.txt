    "in this contribution we discuss a possible quark - model explanation for a narrow structure at @xmath5  mev in the @xmath6 reaction observed by the graal collaboration  @xcite which , however , turned out to be absent in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first to discuss the possibility that the structure could belong to a partner of the @xmath8 pentaquark in the exotic antidecouplet of baryons .",
    "more conventional explanations have attributed the peak to the threshold effect of the @xmath4 channel  @xcite , interference of the nearby @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 resonances  @xcite , constructive and destructive interference of the two lowest @xmath9 resonances in the @xmath12 and @xmath7 channels , respectively , as anticipated in the framework of the giessen model  @xcite as well as in the bonn - gatchina analysis  @xcite . in the framework of the constituent - quark model coupled to the pseudoscalar meson octet",
    "the ( non)appearance of the peak was related to different em multipoles ( at the quark level ) responsible for excitation in either of the two channels  @xcite .",
    "in our recent paper @xcite we have systematically analysed the partial waves with sizable contributions to the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath4 decay channels using a su(3 ) extended version of the cloudy bag model ( cbm )  @xcite which includes also the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons .",
    "we have found that the main contribution to @xmath17 photoproduction at low and intermediate energies comes from the s11 partial wave . in this contribution",
    "we therefore concentrate on the s11 partial wave in which the considered phenomenon is most clearly visible .    in our approach",
    "the main contribution to @xmath17 production in the s11 partial wave stems from the resonant part of the electroproduction amplitude which can be cast in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20-matrix element pertinent to the @xmath21 channel , @xmath22 describes the interaction of the photon with the electromagnetic current and @xmath23 is the spin - isospin factor depending on the considered multipole and the spin and isospin of the outgoing hadrons . here",
    "@xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath27-dependent coefficients determined in the coupled - channel calculation for scattering .    the strong @xmath19 amplitude is obtained in a coupled channel calculation with ten channels involving @xmath28 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath29 mesons .",
    "the most important channels are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ts11 ] .",
    "the behaviour of the amplitudes is dominated by the @xmath30 and @xmath31 resonances as well as the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath4 thresholds .",
    "to    in the present calculation we put the mixing angle @xmath32 to the popular value of @xmath33 and assume that all meson - quark coupling constants are fixed at their quark - model values dictated by the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "while the real part of the elastic amplitude is well reproduced , the imaginary part is rather strongly underestimated in the region of the second resonance which can be to some extent attributed to too strong couplings in the @xmath34 , @xmath14 and @xmath4 channels .",
    "this discrepancy should be taken into account when assessing the quality of the photoproduction amplitudes in the following .",
    "the electromagnetic amplitude in ( [ vgamma2 m ] ) in the s11 partial wave is dominated by the photon - quark coupling while the coupling to the pion cloud turns out to be small .",
    "the spin doublet and quadruplet states involve quarks excited to the @xmath1 orbit with either @xmath35 or @xmath36  @xcite : @xmath37 where the last two components with @xmath38 correspond to coupling the two @xmath39-quarks to spin 1 and 0 , respectively ; the flavour ( isospin ) part is not written explicitly .",
    "the quark part of the dominant @xmath40 transition operator can be cast in the form @xmath41}(i ) +                        \\mathcal{m}_\\th\\sigma_{11}^{[\\th\\h]}(i)\\right ]        \\left[{\\textstyle{1\\over6 } + { 1\\over2}}\\,\\tau_0(i)\\right ] , \\label{bg : ve1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42,\\>\\ > \\label{bg : m12}\\\\ \\mathcal{m}_\\th&= & \\sqrt{2\\over3}\\ , \\int\\d r\\,r^2 \\left[2j_0(qr)u^p_\\th(r ) v^s(r )        + \\half j_2(qr)\\left(u^p_\\th(r ) v^s(r)-3v^p_\\th(r ) u^s(r)\\right )       \\right]\\!.\\kern15pt \\label{bg : m32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quark transition operator is defined through @xmath43}_{lm}|\\half m_s\\rangle =   \\cg{\\h}{m_s}{l}{m}{j}{m_j}$ ] .    evaluating ( [ bg : ve1 ] ) between the resonant states and the nucleon we notice that for the proton , the isoscalar part of the charge operator exactly cancels the isovector part in the case of the first two components in ( [ bg:84 ] ) and ( [ bg:82 ] ) .",
    "this is a general property known as the moorhouse selection rule  @xcite and follows from the fact that the flavour part in these two components corresponds to the mixed symmetric state @xmath44 .",
    "the proton therefore receives no contribution from the @xmath45 transition .",
    "this is not the case with the neutron which receives contributions from all components in ( [ bg:84 ] ) and ( [ bg:82 ] ) .",
    "the quark in the @xmath46 orbit has a distinctly different radial behaviour from that in the @xmath47 orbit , which is reflected in a different @xmath48- and @xmath27-behaviour of the amplitudes ( [ bg : m12 ] ) and ( [ bg : m32 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath40 amplitudes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e0 ] for the proton and the neutron in the region of the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "our results do show a ( bump - like ) structure in the @xmath49 channel , which is absent in the @xmath50 channel , though its strength in the imaginary part is lower compared to the bonn - gatchina 2014 - 2 analysis ( which fits well the experimental cross - section ) .",
    "a moderate rise of the neutron real amplitude below the @xmath4 threshold is clearly a consequence of the contribution from the @xmath3 orbit , while the cusp - like drop in the amplitudes is due to the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "to to    this behaviour of the amplitudes is reflected in the cross - section as a peak ( bump ) present only in the neutron channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) .",
    "though the strength in our model is lower compared to the bonn - gatchina analysis , the qualitative agreement does offer a possible and straightforward explanation of this structure in terms of the quark model : a combination of a peculiar property of the ( relativistic ) wave functions of the @xmath9 resonances and the presence of the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "let us stress that the proposed explanation of the considered peak would not be possible in a framework of the nonrelativistic quark model in which the radial behaviour of the quark wave function depends only on the orbital momentum quantum number .",
    "our model can be envisioned as a version of the single quark transition model ( sqtm ) in which the photon interacts with a single quark in the three - quark core and the other two quarks act as spectators .",
    "the general form of the sqtm operator is a product of the boost operator and current operators  @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 in our approach the quark states are labeled by the total angular momentum @xmath53 rather than the orbital angular momentum and spin . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to expand ( [ bjc ] ) as @xmath54}_{l\\lambda}\\ , , \\qquad      \\langle lj||\\sigma^{[j\\h]}_{l}||0\\half\\rangle = \\delta_{j , l\\pm\\h}\\,.\\ ] ] recoupling the angular momenta we find @xmath55 where @xmath27 are the racah coefficients .    in the case of @xmath56 resonances",
    "@xmath57 , and only the @xmath58 multipole is involved ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) . in this case",
    "the coefficients ( [ bg : m12 ] ) and ( [ bg : m32 ] ) read @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the `` quark electric '' and `` quark magnetic '' multipole moments . table  1 . in @xcite",
    "gives for the corresponding @xmath58 baryon multipole moment of the proton and the neutron which in turn can be related to ( [ bg : m12 ] ) and ( [ bg : m32 ] ) : @xmath64\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in agreement with our conclusion that the @xmath36 orbit contributes only in the @xmath0 channel , which explains the different behaviour of the @xmath7 and @xmath12 channels in @xmath17 photoproduction .",
