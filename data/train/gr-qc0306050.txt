    "the goal of the lisa mission @xcite is to detect and analyze low frequency gravitational signals essentially in the range from 0.1 mhz to 0.1 hz . in this frequency range ,",
    "sources of gravitational waves are mainly the wide population of galactic compact binaries , and interactions between black holes with a range of complexity .",
    "the study of the emission of gw from known binaries could be extremely useful for firstly , direct determination of distances , and secondly , possible small general relativistic effects , if the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is large enough . for this reason ,",
    "we focus on optimising the sensitivity of lisa for a given astrophysical source with known direction .",
    "the sensitivity of lisa can be improved by solving technological problems , but it can also be improved by employing certain optimal data analysis strategies . in this paper , we show how algebraic methods previously developed in @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper i , can be used to design optimal strategies for combining data with appropriate time - delays .",
    "we show in this paper that it is possible to maintain the optimality during the year by continuously updating the parameters of the combination or simply by switching to optimal data combinations as the source appears to move in the lisa frame , as lisa moves in its complex orbit around the sun .",
    "the problem of optimisation of snr , in this context , has been addressed before in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite optimisation",
    "has been carried out before averaging over the directions and polarisations , while in @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper ii , the averaging is done first and then the optimisation . in this paper , the averaging over the polarisations is performed first and then the snr is optimised for the average signal for a given direction over the relevant data combinations - those data combinations canceling laser frequency noise .",
    "thus in this optimisation , the direction of source is assumed to be known , but not its polarisation .",
    "this would be the case for several binaries in our galaxy .",
    "we analyse two observables in this context : ( i ) optimal data combination in the module which yields the maximum snr for a given direction and ( ii ) a ` network ' observable which is obtained by squaring and adding the snrs of two independent(orthogonal ) data combinations one of them being the optimal combination mentioned in ( i ) and another orthogonal to it .",
    "the network observable in general yields higher snr .",
    "we analyse how these snrs depend on direction of the source . for an integration time of one year",
    ", we compare our results by plotting sensitivity curves with those obtained from , ( a ) the michelson combination @xmath1 @xcite , which has been used for obtaining the standard sensitivity curve for lisa , and ( b ) the observable @xmath2 obtained by switching the three michelson combinations optimally .",
    "we find that for sources lying in the ecliptic plane , the network sensitivity at low frequencies is about 34% more than the optimally switched michelson combinations which rises to nearly 90% at 20 mhz .",
    "finally we compute the optimal snrs for six known binary systems in our galaxy , whose snrs are significantly high , for an integration time of one year .",
    "we show that if at low frequencies the two snrs of the orthogonal data combinations can be measured , then it is possible to estimate the inclination angle of the binary s orbit .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ module ] we briefly describe the formalism involving commutative algebra developed in paper i. we also present a convenient set of generators for the data combinations found in paper ii , which consisted of the eigenvectors of the noise - covariance matrix , and in which the computations are simplified . in section [ signal ]",
    "we discuss the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal from non - spinning compact binaries and average the signal over the polarisations . in section [ snr ]",
    "we obtain the optimum snr by the method of lagrange multipliers , where we must solve an eigenvalue problem . in section [ track ]",
    "we describe the transformations from the lisa frame to the barycentric frame and vice - versa . in section [ sens ]",
    "we compute the optimal snrs and the sensitivity curves and compare them with the standard curve for lisa obtained with the michelson data combination @xmath1 and the optimally switched michelson combination @xmath2 . in this section",
    "we also estimate the snrs for a few known binaries in our galaxy and describe a method to estimate the angle of inclination of the binary s orbit , if the two snrs of the orthogonal combinations can be measured .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the results from papers i and ii which are needed for the analysis that follows . in lisa",
    "the six elementary data streams are labeled as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; if the space - crafts are labeled clockwise , the @xmath3 beams also travel clockwise , while the @xmath5 beams travel counter - clockwise . the beam @xmath6 travels from space - craft 3 to space - craft 1 along the arm of length @xmath7 in the direction @xmath8 , while @xmath9 represents the beam traveling from space - craft 2 to space - craft 1 along the arm of length @xmath10 in the direction of @xmath11 .",
    "the remaining 4 beams are described by cyclically permuting the indices .",
    "these beams contain the laser frequency noise , other noises such as optical path , acceleration etc . and also the gw signal . for performing the analysis",
    ", we choose a frame @xmath12 tied to the lisa constellation .",
    "we choose the centroid of the lisa triangle as the origin , the lisa triangle to lie in the @xmath13 plane and space - craft 2 to lie on the @xmath14-axis .",
    "we will henceforth drop the suffix ` @xmath15 ' from the lisa frame quantities and only introduce it when other frames are being considered in the discussion . a schematic diagram of lisa",
    "is shown in fig.[lisagm ] .",
    "[ lisagm ]    in paper i , we showed that all data combinations canceling laser frequency noise form a module over the ring of polynomials in three indeterminates , these being the three - time delay operators @xmath16 of the light travel time along the three arms with lengths @xmath17 respectively .",
    "thus for any data stream @xmath18 . for the lisa specifications @xmath19 sec .",
    "corresponding to an armlength of 5 million km .",
    "a general data combination is a linear combination of the elementary data streams @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are polynomials in the time - delay operators @xmath16 .",
    "thus any data combination can be expressed as a six - tuple polynomial ` vector ' @xmath24 .",
    "for cancellation of laser frequency noise only the polynomial vectors satisfying this constraint are allowed and they form the module of syzygies mentioned above .",
    "an important advantage of this formalism is that , given the generators of the module , any other data combination canceling the laser frequency noise is simply a linear combination of the generators with the coefficients being polynomials in the ring .",
    "several sets of generators have been listed in paper i. based on the physical application as also on convenience , we may choose one set over another .",
    "for the monochromatic sources , as argued in paper ii , only three generators are sufficient to generate the relevant data combinations .",
    "in general 4 generators are necessary to generate the module but if the source is monochromatic , except at certain frequencies which are solutions of @xmath25 , the fourth generator can be effectively eliminated for the purposes of maximising the snr . since",
    "this maximisation is possible arbitrarily close to the singular frequencies the singularities do not seem to be important .",
    "we found in paper ii that a convenient set of generators for our purpose is the one that diagonalises the noise covariance matrix .",
    "these generators are the eigenvectors of the noise covariance matrix .",
    "the noise covariance matrix @xmath26 is defined as the outer product @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a 12 dimensional complex noise vector of the generator @xmath29 ( the @xmath30 could be any set of generators not necessarily the eigenvectors of the noise covariance matrix @xmath31 ) .",
    "the noise vector is given by : @xmath32 where the @xmath33 polynomials are defined through the equations @xmath34 plus cyclic permutations for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the one - sided power spectral densities ( psd ) of the proof - mass noise and the optical - path noise respectively @xcite .    for the purposes of this paper when computing the snr for any given data combination , the differences in armlengths are extremely small compared to the wavelength of the gw we are interested in detecting .",
    "thus we may take the armlengths to be equal , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis it is sufficient to consider lisa as an equilateral triangle ; we ignore the deviations arising from this assumption .",
    "this simplifies the expressions for the noise and further also for the signal .",
    "the eigenvectors now contain overall common factors which are polynomials in @xmath40 .",
    "these common factors make no difference to the computation of snr as they cancel out from the numerator and denominator which comprise of the signal and the noise respectively .",
    "the unnormalised eigenvectors ( with common factors canceled ) of the noise covariance matrix is the set @xmath41 which we list below :    @xmath42    in paper ii , the @xmath43 have been listed with the uncanceled common factors .",
    "we adopt the following terminology : we refer to a single element of the module as a data _ combination _ ; while a function of the elements of the module , such as taking the maximum over several data combinations in the module or squaring and adding data combinations belonging to the module , is called as an _",
    "observable_. the important point to note is that the laser frequency noise is also suppressed for the observable although it may not be an element of the module .",
    "since binaries will be important sources for lisa the analysis of such sources is relevant .",
    "one such class is of massive or super massive binaries whose individual masses could range from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and which could be around a gpc away .",
    "another class of interest are known binaries within our own galaxy whose individual masses are of the order of a solar mass but are just at a distance of a few kpc or less . here",
    "we will assume the direction of the source to be known , which is justified for known binaries in our galaxy ; but even for the former case of distant binaries , it amounts to ` looking ' in a specific direction .",
    "the spacetime metric perturbation for a gravitational wave propagating in a @xmath46 direction can be written as , @xmath47 where the direction to the source is described by direction angles @xmath48 , the unit vector pointing to the source is @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are unit vectors in the direction of the coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 form a right - handed triad .    for a binary that is not chirping , and hence monochromatic with frequency @xmath55 ,",
    "the two polarisation amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite are given by , @xmath58\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "h_{\\times}(t ) & = & h\\left[-\\frac{1+\\cos^{2}\\epsilon}{2}\\sin2\\psi\\,\\cos\\omega t+\\cos\\epsilon\\,\\cos2\\psi\\,\\sin\\omega t\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angles @xmath59 describe the orientation of the binary orbit ( @xmath60 could be the direction angles of the orbital angular momentum vector ) and @xmath61 the overall amplitude which depends on the masses , the distance and the frequency @xmath62 as given below : @xmath63^{\\frac{5}{3 } } \\cdot   \\left[\\frac{r}{1\\,\\mathrm{gpc}}\\right]^{-1}\\cdot\\left[\\frac{f}{1\\,\\mathrm{mhz}}\\right]^{2/3}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the distance to the source , @xmath65 is the gw frequency of the source and @xmath66 the chirp - mass , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are respectively the reduced and the total mass of the binary . for the typical parameters taken above the frequency",
    "evolves very slowly , so much so that the time for the system to coalesce is more than 20 years . for an observational time of the order of an year , the frequency of the binary changes very little so that the source can be practically taken to be monochromatic .",
    "since we deal with essentially monochromatic sources , the fourier domain is appropriate for further analysis . in the fourier domain",
    "we have ,    @xmath69\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "h_{\\times}(\\omega ) & = & h \\left[-\\frac{1+\\cos^{2}\\epsilon}{2}\\sin2\\psi - i\\,\\cos\\epsilon\\,\\cos2\\psi\\right]\\ , \\label{sig}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the gw response for a generator @xmath70 is ( see papers i and ii ) ,    @xmath71    where , @xmath72 where we have expressed the response of the two polarisations in terms of the responses of the elementary data streams for each of the polarisations .",
    "below we state the responses for the @xmath73 and @xmath74 polarisations for the beams @xmath6 and @xmath75 only ; the responses for the remaining four beams @xmath76 are obtained from cyclic permutations : @xmath77 where , @xmath78 we define the signal covariance matrix @xmath79 in analogous fashion as the noise covariance matrix",
    ". it is given as follows : @xmath80 in general we may not have any knowledge of the polarisation of the gw binary source .",
    "we therefore average over the polarizations and assume that the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the binary is uniformly distributed over the sphere .",
    "the orientation of the binary ( its orbital angular momentum vector ) has been described in terms of the angles @xmath81 and @xmath82 in eq.([sig ] ) .",
    "thus we carry out the averaging of @xmath79 over @xmath83 which results in an overall factor of @xmath84 .",
    "the averaged matrix we denote by @xmath85 . in the fourier domain it is given by ,    @xmath86    the signal matrix so averaged has the following properties :    * @xmath87 is the sum of outer products of two vectors : @xmath88 with its complex conjugate and @xmath89 with its complex conjugate .",
    "thus the natural basis for expressing @xmath87 consists of the two vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the analysis that follows we will use this fact . *",
    "because we average over the polarisations , @xmath87 is constructed out of two vectors .",
    "its rank is two , everywhere except on the @xmath90 plane where it is one when @xmath89 goes identically to zero . in paper",
    "ii we had obtained a signal matrix of rank three because there we had averaged over the directions as well . while in @xcite , since optimisation is performed first before averaging , the signal matrix is constituted from a single vector and thus has rank one .",
    "for a generic data combination @xmath91 where @xmath92 are polynomials in @xmath40 , the snr is given by :    @xmath93    if the psd is given in units of hz@xmath94 then the above equation yields the square of the snr integrated over one second . because one second is short compared to the various time - scales envisaged in the problem we call this snr the _ instantaneous _ snr .",
    "since we are dealing with monochromatic sources , @xmath95 , the coefficients @xmath92 reduce to just complex numbers .",
    "also in the generating set @xmath96 the noise covariance matrix is diagonal with diagonal elements @xmath97 .",
    "however , we find @xmath98 in our case , so that the first two eigenvectors correspond to the same eigenvalue .",
    "thus , the denominator of eq.([gensnr ] ) simplifies to a sum of squares @xmath99 which we can set equal to unity because the snr does not depend on the normalisation of the data combination .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to define coefficients @xmath100 which are scaled by the noise , @xmath101 so that the @xmath102 satisfy , @xmath103 the expression for snr simplifies to , @xmath104 where we define a snr matrix @xmath105 by , @xmath106 in the above equations the @xmath107 are construed of as @xmath108 column matrices and @xmath87 and @xmath105 as @xmath109 square matrices .",
    "the extremisation of snr is now carried out with the method of lagrange multipliers because of the normalisation constraint on @xmath100 .",
    "this procedure yields an eigenvalue equation with the lagrange multiplier appearing as an eigenvalue : @xmath110 since @xmath87 has atmost rank 2 , one eigenvalue is necessarily zero .",
    "we now proceed to compute the other two eigenvalues .",
    "the analysis is simplified if we go to the basis consisting of the two vectors @xmath111 and @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the amplitude of the gw averaged over the polarisation states at frequency @xmath55 .",
    "we can then write the matrix @xmath105 as a tensor product in terms of these two vectors : @xmath115 in general the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 are not orthogonal .",
    "the action of the matrix @xmath105 on any vector @xmath118 is given by , @xmath119 for the eigenvalue problem , we have the eigenvalue equation , @xmath120 expressing the eigenvector @xmath121 as a linear combination of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and from the linear independence of @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( they are linearly independent in general ) we obtain the system of equations for @xmath125 and @xmath126 as : @xmath127 setting the determinant of this system to zero , we obtain eigenvalue equation :    @xmath128    which can be solved to yield the eigenvalues : @xmath129 where , @xmath130 in the low frequency limit as we shall find @xmath131 so that the positive square root of @xmath132 is just @xmath133 and the eigenvalues are just @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( infact the eigenvalue equation factorises into linear factors ) with @xmath116 and @xmath117 as eigenvectors respectively .",
    "this can also be directly inferred from the structure of @xmath105 .",
    "so it may be appropriate to call @xmath136 as @xmath137 even in the general case . in the general case",
    "the eigenvectors can be easily determined from eq.([eqn : eigncnd ] ) : @xmath138 where @xmath139 are eigenvectors belonging to the eigenvalues @xmath140 respectively . since @xmath105 is hermitian",
    "the eigenvectors are orthogonal , @xmath141 as can be verified also directly from the expressions of the eigenvectors .",
    "these eigenvectors are not normalised .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath140 are the squares of the instantaneous snrs for the two data combinations described by the two corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "the data combinations are @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which we will call eigen - combinations or alternatively eigen - observables , and which give the instantaneous snrs : snr@xmath144 respectively . for a given direction @xmath145 in the lisa frame",
    ", snr@xmath146 is the maximum instantaneous snr among all data combinations . while snr@xmath147 is the minimum instantaneous snr among data combinations that are linear combinations of @xmath148 and @xmath149 ; those which lie in the ` plane ' of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "however , snr@xmath147 is not zero in general and therefore not the absolute minimum ; the absolute minimum snr is zero corresponding to the third eigenvalue which is zero .",
    "moreover , the eigenvectors are orthogonal , which means they yield statistically independent observables .",
    "thus these observables can be combined in quadratures to form a network observable with instantaneous snr@xmath150 given by : @xmath151 the third eigenvector is @xmath152 ; it is orthogonal to @xmath116 and @xmath117 with eigenvalue zero .",
    "this means that the data combination corresponding to this vector gives zero response in that particular direction , which may be important if one wishes to ` switch off ' the gw coming from that direction .",
    "in general the amplitude of the gw source will be small and it would be necessary to track or follow the source for a considerable period of time in order to accumulate an adequate snr .",
    "this period of time could range from few days to a year or even years - the life of the lisa experiment .",
    "the lisa configuration performs a complex motion due to which the source will appear to move in the lisa frame even if it is stationary in the barycentric frame . for the purposes of this analysis , we will take the observation time to be a year and integrate the snr for this period of time .",
    "it is possible that some gw sources may be sufficiently powerful that snr integration for an year is not required . in that case",
    "it is easily possible to limit the integration to the required period of observation and obtain useful results .",
    "we will also assume that the source is stationary in the barycentric frame , that is , its direction remains constant during the observation period . in this section",
    "we will present the transformations connecting the barycentric frame and the lisa frame and hence obtain the apparent motion in the lisa frame for a gw source fixed in the barycentric frame .",
    "the lisa constellation trails the earth in its orbit by @xmath153 around the sun .",
    "the plane of lisa makes an angle of @xmath154 with the plane of the ecliptic and the lisa triangle rotates in its own plane completing one rotation in a year .",
    "we describe the barycentric frame by the cartesian coordinates @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath156 plane coincides with the orbital plane of lisa .",
    "the @xmath157-axis is orthogonal to this plane forming a right - handed coordinate system .",
    "the transformation from the barycentric frame to lisa frame is given as follows @xcite : a vector @xmath158 is transformed to @xmath159 by the matrix @xmath160 as , @xmath161 where @xmath160 is a product of the three matrices containing euler angles : @xmath162 where the matrices @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 are given by , @xmath166 here @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "@xmath170 is the orbital period of lisa which we take to be of one year duration .",
    "the @xmath171 and @xmath172 are constants fixing initial conditions when the observation begins .",
    "the matrix @xmath160 is time - dependent and is a product of two time - dependent matrices .",
    "the unit vector @xmath173 of the source direction described by the angles @xmath174 in the barycentric frame is given by @xmath175 .",
    "the corresponding vector @xmath176 in the lisa frame is then , @xmath177 . from this vector",
    "we can explicitly work out the angles @xmath178 :    @xmath179    where , @xmath180 for a fixed source direction @xmath174 in the barycentric frame , the apparent source direction depends on time in the lisa frame ; @xmath181 are functions of time ; the source appears to move in the lisa frame .",
    "thus a given data combination even if it is optimal initially , will not continue to remain optimal subsequently .",
    "our strategy is then to _ switch _ the data combinations continuously so that the snr remains optimal at all times . in this way we can optimally track the source and accumulate maximum snr .",
    "the following figures show the apparent trajectory of the source for one year in the lisa frame when ( i ) the source lies at the pole of the barycentric frame - it is just a circle in the lisa frame : @xmath182 ( see fig.[trk1 ] ) and ( ii ) the source lies in plane of the lisa orbit - a figure of 8 is described by the source ( see fig.[apptrk ] ) .    .",
    "the track of the source for a period of one year is shown on the unit sphere in the lisa frame .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] [ trk1 ]    .",
    "the track of the source for a period of one year is shown on the unit sphere in the lisa frame .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] [ apptrk ]",
    "for optimal tracking of the source , we switch the data combinations so that the snrs yielded are optimal at all times .",
    "three snrs are of interest ; @xmath183 and snr@xmath150 , that is , the two eigenvalues and their sum .",
    "the eigenvalues are functions of @xmath181 which are in turn functions of @xmath184 as the gw source describes its apparent motion in the lisa frame .",
    "the three integrated snrs are given by : @xmath185 where we have taken the total observation time to be @xmath186 and the initial time of observation to be zero .",
    "if we integrate for a complete year , we can set the initial observation time to be zero without loss of generality and at the same time set the constants @xmath187 to be zero .",
    "however , if we make observations for times that are not integral number of years , the constants @xmath187 must be chosen appropriately in the transformation matrix @xmath160 .",
    "an important point is that , since lisa moves in an heliocentric orbit , a doppler phase depending on the position vector of the lisa projected on to the direction to the source @xmath188 and the gw frequency will be added to the phase of the gw signal .",
    "this doppler phase will be a function of time which will be added to the monochromatic part of the phase @xmath189 of the signal .",
    "we assume in this analysis that this phase has been accounted for when integrating the signal .",
    "one way is to ` stretch ' the time - coordinate so that the signal appears monochromatic ( a technique well - known to radio astronomers)@xcite .",
    "an important case arises when we consider gw of low frequencies , say below 3 mhz . for this case",
    "it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the optimal snrs . a large fraction of the sources for lisa fall into this category , for example , massive / supermassive blackhole binaries , several galactic and extragalactic binaries which contribute to the ` confusion noise ' .",
    "we need to compute the @xmath116 and @xmath117 in order to compute the snr matrix @xmath105 and then obtain its eigenvalues . integrating the eigenvalues for the period of observation will yield the relevant snrs . to this end , we expand @xmath190 and @xmath191 to the lowest order in the dimensionless frequency @xmath192 :    @xmath193    where , @xmath194 where , @xmath195 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath196-th spacecraft and @xmath197 and the angles @xmath198 refer to the lisa frame ( as before we have dropped the subscript ` @xmath15 ' ) .",
    "the transfer functions for the four other elementary data streams are obtained by cyclic permutations . in order to get the @xmath199 we must operate on the @xmath20 with the polynomial operators @xmath200 given in eq.([basis ] ) and",
    "then scale them by the averaged signal divided by the noise .",
    "thus , we obtain after some algebra , @xmath201 where , @xmath202 the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 are expressed in the @xmath43 basis and in this basis they have real components .",
    "we observe the following properties of the vectors :    *   the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 lie in the @xmath203 plane and the @xmath204 component is zero for both vectors .",
    "this can be understood if we recall that @xmath204 is proportional to symmetric sagnac combination @xcite which is insensitive to gw at low frequency .",
    "* the apparent motion of a gw source in the lisa frame can be optimally and continuously tracked by @xmath205 and @xmath206 by rotating the pair @xmath207 by @xmath208 at each instant of time as follows : @xmath209 here @xmath205 and @xmath206 are unit vectors in the directions of @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "thus , optimally tracking a source amounts to orienting the data combinations along @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "* moreover , the vectors are orthogonal : @xmath210 in this low frequency limit .",
    "the orthogonality implies that these eigen - observables @xmath116 and @xmath117 have zero response to @xmath74 and @xmath73 polarizations of gw respectively .",
    "we use this fact to estimate the polarisation angles ; namely @xmath211 at the end of this section .",
    "the eigenvalues of the eigen - vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 are just @xmath134 and @xmath135 and are explicitly given by , @xmath212 the eigenvalues are the squares of the instantaneous snrs .",
    "we notice that @xmath213 is the maximum instantaneous snr obtained when the source lies at the poles @xmath214 or @xmath215 in the lisa frame .",
    "if the source is observed over a period of an year , the eigenvalues must be integrated over this length of time .",
    "we notice that the eigenvalues do not depend on @xmath53 .",
    "thus our next task of integrating the snr becomes somewhat simplified .      for a given source direction @xmath174 the corresponding track @xmath216 of the source in lisa frame",
    "is given by eq.([trns ] ) .",
    "we may substitute these values into the integrals for the snrs and the integrals yield simple analytical expressions for the snrs if the integration is over an integral number of years .",
    "the instantaneous snrs however change with time . in the fig.[snrtime ] we show how the snrs change with time as lisa orbits the sun during the course of a year .",
    "the various snrs are shown for a source lying in the ecliptic plane , @xmath217 for the gw frequency of 1 mhz .",
    "we have chosen this direction because the snrs show considerable variations during the course of a year .     and",

    "infact since only @xmath224 occurs in the expressions of @xmath227 there is symmetry about the ecliptic plane .",
    "the network snr is just the root mean square of the two snrs : @xmath228 where , @xmath229 . in fig.[intsnr ] we plot the functions @xmath227 and @xmath230 as functions of @xmath231 between @xmath232 .",
    "the factors @xmath233 are of the order of unity and the snr@xmath234 gives essentially the integrated snr of a gw source .",

    "@xmath230 as functions of @xmath231,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ intsnr ]    we observe from fig.[intsnr ] that the maximum integrated snr is obtained for sources lying in the ecliptic plane @xmath235 .",
    "this can be readily explained from fig.[apptrk ] where the trajectory of such a source is plotted .",
    "one observes that a large fraction of the orbit in the lisa frame is _ away _ from the lisa plane @xmath236 . as seen from eq.([eigsnr ] ) the sensitivity of lisa increases as we go away from the plane of lisa , that is , towards the poles .",
    "we also observe that the variations in the three curves are small ; among these the network snr shows the highest variation of @xmath237 .",
    "this shows that lisa has a more or less uniform average response over the year as it moves in its orbit .",
    "the above formulae are also more generally valid if the integration time @xmath186 is taken to be in integral multiples of @xmath170 ; then the @xmath170 in eq.([snr0 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath186 .",
    "we compute the snrs of six binaries in our galaxy which give high average snr ( averaged over polarisations ) if we integrate the snr optimally over the period of a year .",
    "the following table lists six binary systems which give the network snrs ranging from about 3 to over 100 .",
    "the snrs have been computed assuming circular orbits for the binaries .",
    "the information about the binaries has been obtained from @xcite .",
    "we observe that the binary masses are small ; @xmath238 and companion mass @xmath239 .",
    "the reason for such small masses is that the orbital periods of the binaries must be short , in this case ranging from about .01 to .03 of a day .",
    "the gw quadrupole frequency @xmath240 is related to the orbital period by the equation : @xmath241 thus the sources radiate gw at frequencies @xmath242 1 or 2 mhz , the band in which lisa has maximum sensitivity .",
    "this yields the high snrs .",
    "they are also close by ; @xmath243 or 200 pc which tends to increase the raw gravitational wave amplitude @xmath61 .",
    "note that the snrs listed in the table are average and actual observations can yield different values depending on the orientation of the binary orbit .",
    "also the observables used are optimal in the average sense .",
    "if the orientation of the binary is known then in general a better observable can be found .",
    ".in this table we list six binaries in our galaxy whose parameters are known . for these",
    "we compute the optimum snrs where the optimisation has been performed after averaging over the polarisations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ bin ]      we showed in previous sections that if we do not have any prior information of the inclination angle @xmath81 of the binary orbit and the the angle @xmath82 , then tracking the source with @xmath205 and @xmath206 are optimal in the average sense . typically , the orbital inclination is difficult to estimate from other astrophysical observational means .",
    "however , for binaries with known masses and distances ( e.g. binaries in table-[bin ] ) , we can estimate @xmath211 from the output of eigen - observables @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the integrated snrs over the period of one year of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , _ without averaging over polarisations _ are given by @xmath244 where @xmath245 and @xmath246 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sig ] ) ) .",
    "we note that here the factor @xmath247 appears , since there is no averaging over the polarisations .",
    "the @xmath248 can be estimated , if the snrs appearing on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ est ] ) can be measured .",
    "further , straightforward algebra shows that @xmath249 from the above equation , we can estimate @xmath81 . substituting back in @xmath250",
    ", one can also estimate @xmath82 if needed .",
    "this exercise can be carried out for the binaries listed in the table [ bin ] .      in this section",
    "we relax the condition of dealing only with low frequencies and consider the entire band - width of lisa .",
    "we compare the sensitivities for lisa obtained by using the optimum snr with the michelson data combination usually denoted by @xmath1 . as a polynomial vector @xmath24 it is given by : @xmath251 when we set all the @xmath252 to be equal , the factor @xmath253 factors out and one is left with a simple polynomial vector @xmath254 .",
    "this combination has been used to plot the standard lisa sensitivity curve .",
    "two other michelson observables are obtained by cyclic permutations called @xmath255 and @xmath256 in the literature @xcite . in this section",
    "we will compare the sensitivities obtained by using the eigen - combination @xmath257 and the network observable with the michelson combination @xmath1 and the observable @xmath2 obtained by ` switching ' the michelson s @xmath258 optimally , that is , @xmath259 . extending the definition of sensitivity of a data combination from earlier literature @xcite to an observable",
    ", we define the sensitivity of an observable @xmath260 as , @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the integrated snr over a observation period @xmath186 .",
    "the number @xmath263 has been chosen following earlier literature .",
    "( [ eq : intsen ] ) for a fixed data combination @xmath264 reduces to the standard one in literature : @xmath265 where @xmath266 . as before we take @xmath220 for plotting the sensitivity curves in the figures below .",
    "the results of our findings are displayed in the plots .",
    "fig.[fig : sens1 ] displays the sensitivity curves for the observables ( a ) michelson - @xmath1 ( dotted curve ) , ( b ) switched michelson @xmath2 ( dash - dotted curve ) , ( c ) eigen - combination @xmath257 ( dashed curve ) and ( d ) network observable ( solid curve ) .     and network for the source direction @xmath267.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : sens1 ]",
    "we observe that the sensitivity over the band - width of lisa increases as we go from ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "we observe that the @xmath2 does not do much better than @xmath1 .",
    "this is because for the source direction chosen @xmath1 is reasonably well oriented and there is not much switching to @xmath255 and @xmath256 combinations .",
    "however , the network and @xmath257 observables show significant improvement in sensitivity over both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the sensitivity curves ( except @xmath1 ) do not show much variations for other source directions and the plots are similar .",
    "the quantitative comparison of sensitivities is shown in fig.[fig : snrratio ] .",
    "with @xmath2 for the source direction @xmath267.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : snrratio ]    here we have compared the network , and the eigen - combinations @xmath139 with @xmath2 . defining : @xmath268 where the subscript @xmath269 stands for network or @xmath270 and @xmath271 the snr of the observable @xmath2 , we plot these ratios of sensitivities over the lisa band - width .",
    "we notice from the @xmath272 curve that the improvement in sensitivity for the network observable is about 34@xmath0 at low frequencies and rises to nearly 90 @xmath0 at about 20 mhz , while at the same time the @xmath257 combination shows improvement of 12 @xmath0 at low frequencies rising to over 50 @xmath0 at 20 mhz .",
    "finally , fig.[fig : sens - net ] exhibits the sensitivities of the network observable over various source directions .",
    "since the sensitivity of this observable is independent of @xmath273 , we plot the curves for several values of @xmath274 degrees . also since the network observable possesses reflection symmetry about the ecliptic plane @xmath275",
    ", we do not need to plot the curves @xmath231 between @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "the important observation from this figure is that not much variation in sensitivity is seen as all source directions are scanned .",
    "thus the network observable integrated over the year has essentially uniform sensitivity to all source directions over the frequency range @xmath278 hz .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : sens - net ]",
    "we have shown how the snr can be optimised for a gw source with known direction but with unknown polarisation . while obtaining the snr the signal",
    "is averaged over the polarisations and then optimised .",
    "because of this procedure we lose out to some extent on the snr but on the otherhand it leads to robust results .",
    "the optimisation methods are algebraic in that one must solve an eigenvalue equation to determine the optimum snrs .",
    "we separately deal with the low frequency case as it is of considerable astrophysical importance - a large fraction of gw sources are expected to be of this category .",
    "secondly , it lends itself to simple analytical approximations which throw light on the results obtained .",
    "lastly , we deal with the general case covering the full band - width of lisa .",
    "we have compared the sensitivities obtained with our strategy to those obtained in the standard way .",
    "we find that the improvement in sensitivity of the network observable over the @xmath1 or @xmath2 ranges from about 34% to nearly 90% over the bandwidth of lisa for a source lying the ecliptic plane .",
    "finally we present a list of few binaries in our galaxy for which the optimal snrs and the network snrs have been computed .",
    "we also describe a method of extracting information about the inclination angle of the orbit of the binary if @xmath183 can be measured .",
