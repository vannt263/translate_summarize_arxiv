    "the chandrax - ray observatory ( cxo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has observed an extremely diverse range of x - ray emitting astrophysical sources , ranging from spatially extended diffuse sources such as x - ray clusters to bright point - like sources such as galactic black hole binaries . even within the category of x - ray point sources ,",
    "chandrahas observed the widest range of source x - ray fluxes of any previously flown x - ray satellite  spanning literally more than 10 orders of magnitude from the @xmath1 flux limits of the chandradeep fields @xcite to the @xmath2 of sco  x-1 .",
    "these observations have occurred in a variety of instrumental arrangements , determined by whether or not either of the two gratings configurations ( the high energy transmission grating , hetg , @xcite , and the low energy transmission grating , letg , @xcite ) was inserted into the optical path , and by which set of detectors ( the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer , acis - sand acis - i , ccds , @xcite , or the high resolution camera , hrc - sand hrc - i , @xcite ) were placed in the focal plane . although nearly all possible instrument / detector configurations have been used at some point over the mission lifetime , the majority of chandraobservations have been conducted with the acisccds inserted into the focal plane and without the use of any gratings .",
    "for this reason , the first release of the chandra source catalog(csc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consists solely of such observations .",
    "the chandra source catalogfollows in the long tradition of using x - ray satellite observations to create surveys of detected sources , encompassing both those sources that were the targets of the original observing proposals and serendipitously discovered sources .",
    "such past and present surveys include the einstein survey ( over 800 sources ; * ? ? ? * ) , the rosat surveys of bright and faint sources ( @xmath3 sources ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its counterpart wgacat ( @xmath4 sources ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the asca medium sensitivity survey ( @xmath5 sources ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the recent xmm - newtonsurvey ( 2xmm , with @xmath6 detections from 3,491 observations ; * ? ? ?",
    "what makes the cscunique among these surveys is the unsurpassed ( in the x - ray ) spatial resolution of chandra , which is @xmath7 for on - axis sources .",
    "it is anticipated that over a 20 year lifetime , chandrawill conduct over 20,000 separate acisand hrcobservations which will yield over 250,000 significantly detected x - ray sources .",
    "these sources already include a diverse set of objects spanning local sources within our own solar system to distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "the ultimate goal of the cscis to represent the full diversity of chandraobserved sources , and to include both point - like and extended sources .",
    "the initial release of the chandra source cataloglimits itself in several ways @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , it only considers acisobservations without any inserted gratings .",
    "( a subset of no - gratings hrcobservations was included as of release v1.1 .",
    "sources detected from the zeroth - order images of gratings observations eventually will be included . ) furthermore , source detections are derived from single observations , as opposed to merged observations from the same field .",
    "the chandra source catalogdoes define `` master sources '' as distinct x - ray sources , which may be observed in more than one observation .",
    "however , master source properties such as position and flux are derived from appropriate combination of the corresponding properties from spatially coincident sources separately detected in individual observations .",
    "other master source properties , such as inter - observation variability , are derived by collating and comparing properties from contributing sources detected in individual observations .",
    "future releases of the cscwill include properties derived from data combined prior to source detection .",
    "the initial release of the cscalso limits sources to ( physical and/or instrumental ) source extents @xmath8 .",
    "these restrictions of the initially released csccan be compared to those found in a number of other released catalogs covering chandraobservations .    numerous such chandracatalogs already exist .",
    "prominent among these are those that deal specifically with a well - defined set of fields of view .",
    "examples of such targeted catalogs include the chandradeep fields north ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* now containing over 500 sources ) and south ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* with nearly 600 sources when including the flanking fields ) , and the chandraultra - deep orion project ( coup ; * ? ? ?",
    "* with over 1,600 sources ) .",
    "although these catalogs currently consider source detections and properties from merged observations , they are far more restricted in terms of fields of view than the chandra source catalog .",
    "more general catalogs include the chandramulti - wavelength project ( champ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* with nearly 1,000 sources ) ; however , it too does not cover the full scope of fields of view as is covered by the csc .",
    "furthermore , these existing catalogs are all driven by the specific scientific goals of the projects that produced them .",
    "they do not share commonly defined source properties or analysis procedures .",
    "the chandra source catalogdiffers from these catalogs in several important respects .",
    "all data for all observations of a given chandradetector are processed in a uniform manner with a uniformly defined set of source properties .",
    "the cscalso aims to be the most inclusive of any chandracatalog . with few exceptions ,",
    "all data from all active acisccds were searched for sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the criteria by which whole observations , or individual ccd detectors within an observation , were excluded ) .",
    "the intended audience for the cscis not limited to x - ray astronomers nor to any particular sub - field of study within astronomy ; it is intended as a general resource for all astronomers working at any wavelength .",
    "the chandra source catalogis the product of a series of complex data processing pipelines . in order to take full advantage of the cscproducts",
    ", users must understand the capabilities of both the chandraobservatory and the cscanalysis system .",
    "the cxotelescope and detectors have been documented extensively in numerous publications @xcite .",
    "the cscanalysis system and first release products have been described by @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we describe in more detail the procedures used to characterize the capabilities of that analysis system , and the results of this characterization .",
    "the statistical characterization of the catalog source properties is accomplished primarily through the use of simulated datasets .",
    "these simulations include both empty fields ( blank - sky ) and simulated sources .",
    "for the most part , these simulated datasets are processed by the catalog pipelines in the exact same fashion as real datasets .",
    "we present here a summary of those results .",
    "we begin with a summary of the overall properties of the source catalog .",

    "the first release of the chandra source catalogcontains 135,914 individual source entries from 3,912 separate acisobservations available in the chandra public archive as of to dec . 31 , 2008 .",
    "because many chandra targets were observed more than once , these individual source entries correspond to 94,676 unique `` master sources '' .",

    "[ fluxdist ] because they represent a hetergeneous mixture of sources of all types included in the csc .",

    "cscbackground rates are in general comparable to those reported in the chandraproposers observatory guide , and reflect the overall changes in background rate during the lifetime of the mission .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ brate ] , in which we display histograms of background rates for chips 03 and 58 , using observations taken before ( black ) and after ( red ) the median epoch .",

    "a limiting sensitivity map is computed for each observation i d ( obsid ) that contributes to the chandra source catalog , in each of the 5 science energy bands .",
    "the maps are derived from the cscmodel background maps for the obsid .",
    "statistical noise appropriate to the observation is introduced by randomly sampling from poisson distributions whose means are equal to the model background values in each map pixel .",
    "each sensitivity map pixel represents the minimum point source photon flux needed to yield a flux significance greater than or equal to the catalog inclusion limit ( @xmath19 ) at that location , when background is obtained from a region in the randomized background map appropriate to background apertures at that pixel location .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "an example sensitivity map is shown in fig .",
    "[ lsmap ] .    because the limiting sensitivity maps are derived from model background maps , and not directly from the event data used to compute individual photon fluxes , it is important to demonstrate that they are consistent with the fluxes of sources included in the chandra source catalog .",
    "we compare the photon fluxes of sources reported in individual obsids in the cscto the values of those obsids sensitivity maps at the corresponding source locations .",
    "photon fluxes for detected sources should all be greater than or equal to the corresponding limiting sensitivity values .",

    "two of the twenty - one are inconsistent with the sensitivity limit when 68% confidence bounds on flux are considered , but are consistent at the 90% level . for the remaining two sources , labeled by obsid in fig .",
    "[ badsens ] , we find anomalous chip configurations . for obsid 350 , the target chip ( chip 7 ) contained significant extended emission and was dropped from analysis ; the source in question was located at the interface of chips 6 and 7 . for obsid 808 ,",

    "time bins with multiple counts were considered to be potentially subject to the effects of pileup , following the simple pileup model of @xcite . for each count in a single time bin in such cases",
    ", we assigned a 0.95 chance that it fell within the central `` piled region '' , and then drew a random variable ( to be compared to the binomial distribution ) to determine how many of the events were within this region . once that number , @xmath61 , was determined , a probability @xmath62 was assigned to all the piled region events being read as a single event , with @xmath63 being the probability that no counts would be registered for the piled region .",
    "this procedure then yielded the final lightcurves to which each of the above three variability tests was applied .",

    "the concept behind the colors reflecting the values of the aperture photon fluxes is to partially normalize out variations induced by spatially and temporally dependent detector responses .",

    "it is hoped that sources with the same intrinsic colors will yield similar estimated hardnesses regardless of observing epoch or detector position .",

    "furthermore , given the excellent sensitivity of chandrato extremely faint sources , many faint cscsources have zero net counts in one or two bands .",

    "we have previously noted the biases in the estimated photon fluxes in section [ sec : photometry ] , and they have also been described in section 2.5.2 of @xcite .",
