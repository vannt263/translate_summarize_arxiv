    "<S> ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 . ) ]        so far we have analyzed the topological existence of defects perforating the fm - polar interface . in order to determine their energetic stability and the core structure we numerically minimize the energy of the constructed defect in a rotating frame @xmath59 by evolving the corresponding coupled spin-1 gross - pitaevskii equations in imaginary time . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 denotes the frequency of rotation that is assumed to be around the @xmath32 axis , @xmath61 is the @xmath32-component of the angular momentum and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a slightly cigar - shaped trap @xmath63  ) to the case of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we also checked that fixing the magnetization @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 are the total populations of @xmath43 ) during the relaxation does not alter the basic results . ] .    minimizing the the energy of @xmath67 results in the core deformation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:012 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the state exhibits the coreless vortex on the fm side of the interface [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:012](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of rotation determines the direction of the spin vector at the edge of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the core of the singly quantized vortex in the polar part is deformed into two half - quantum vortices .    </S>",
    "<S> the size of a singular defect core with vanishing density is determined by @xmath68 , the density healing length . </S>",
    "<S> the singular polar vortex lowers its energy by spontaneously breaking axial symmetry , splitting into half - quantum vortices with fm cores of size @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation is energetically favorable when the energy cost of the fm cores is smaller than the energy gained by removing the density depletion . </S>",
    "<S> we find the same splitting of the polar vortex for the defect with a singular vortex in both phases .    a very intriguing core deformation results from minimizing the energy of a singular spin vortex terminating on a polar monopole [ fig .  [ fig : schematic](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the point defect requires the density to go to zero . for sufficiently large @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> , the energy cost of the density depletion can be avoided by deforming the point defect into a semicircular line defect with fm core whose ends attach to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : alice ] shows the resulting arch - like defect .    </S>",
    "<S> the arch is formed as a local deformation of the point defect , and retains its topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the radial hedgehog in the nematic axis @xmath23 is preserved away from the arch . </S>",
    "<S> single - valuedness of @xmath70 then requires that @xmath23 turn by @xmath36 on any closed loop through the arch , accompanied by a @xmath36 change in the phase @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify the line defect as an arch - shaped half - quantum vortex , which we will call an alice arch , as it is the interface analogue of the complete alice ring  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such ring - shaped defects are analogous to alice rings in high energy physics  @xcite with a topological charge similar to the magnetic  cheshire \" charge  @xcite we find that the deformation of a point defect to an arch is energetically favorable for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> it is unstable towards drifting out of the cloud due to the density gradient , but could be stabilized by a weak pinning potential .    </S>",
    "<S> different defect structures penetrating the interface can be prepared experimentally by recognizing that the defects are composed of simple vortex lines , phase kink planes or , in more complex cases , by vortex rings in the three spinor components , each of which may be phase - imprinted using existing technologies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vortices may also nucleate due to rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nucleation energetically favors defects consisting of a half - quantum vortex connecting to a coreless vortex , leading to states such as that illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic](g ) .    </S>",
    "<S> here we have demonstrated topological interface engineering by studying examples of defect perforation across a fm - polar interface in a spin-1 bec . </S>",
    "<S> vortex bifurcation purely due to an energetic ( not topological ) effect in the phase separation of a two - species bec was studied in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method can be extended to more complex broken symmetries in  @xcite and  @xcite becs that also support , e.g. , non - abelian defects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other particularly promising systems for topological interface physics are strongly correlated atoms in optical lattices  @xcite exhibiting also quantum phase transitions and potential analogues of exotic superconductivity  @xcite in crystal lattices .    nonequilibrium defect production may be investigated in phase transitions in the presence of different broken symmetries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> defect formation from colliding interfaces can be employed as a model to simulate cosmological brane annihilation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in a fm condensate , a slab of polar phase could be created , each interface being a 2d analogue of a @xmath72-brane . removing the interaction shift causes the slab to collapse , bringing the interfaces closer until they meet and annihilate , representing an annihilation of a brane - antibrane pair . in braneworld scenarios of cosmic inflation </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation may lead to defect production  @xcite that could be directly observed in atomic becs . a similar experiment has been performed with superfluid liquid @xmath0he @xmath1-@xmath2 interfaces in which case , however , the detection of defects is difficult  @xcite .    </S>",
