    "motivated by the study of quantum critical phase transitions hoava introduced a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional quantum gravity model , later on called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity , that is power - counting renormalizable @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent status report ) .",
    "this model reduces to general relativity ( gr ) in the infrared ( ir ) limit , i.e. at large distances , however breaks lorentz symmetry in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , i.e. at short distances .",
    "the reason for this is that the model contains an anisotropic scaling with dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 of the form @xmath2 in the ir the exponent becomes @xmath3 and the theory is lorentz - invariant .",
    "however , in the uv there is a strong asymmetry between space and time with @xmath4 . in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions",
    "@xmath5 @xcite and the gravity theory becomes power - counting renormalizable .",
    "concretely , this model breaks lorentz invariance at short distances because it contains only higher order spatial derivatives in the action , while higher order temporal derivatives ( which would lead to ghost degrees of freedom ) do not appear .",
    "a number of explicit solutions of hl gravity have been found , in particular spherically symmetric black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the most general spherically symmetric solution has been given in @xcite and rotating generalizations have been studied in @xcite .",
    "one of the open problems of the model is how to couple it to matter fields .",
    "the question of how to describe particle motion in hl gravity , i.e. to find the equivalent to the geodesic equation of gr has been addressed in @xcite . in @xcite particles",
    "were studied as the optical limit of a scalar field , while in @xcite a super hamiltonian formalism with modified dispersion relations was used . in both papers",
    "it was found that new features arise in hl gravity such as superluminal motion and luminal motion of massive particles . in @xcite",
    "a particle action preserving foliation diffeomorphisms was introduced and it was found that massless particles follow gr geodesics , while the trajectories of massive particles depend on their mass . in most studies of test particle motion",
    "the hypothetical corrections to the gr geodesics were neglected @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take the latter viewpoint and study solutions to the gr geodesic equation in hl black hole space - times , in particular in the space - time of a kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) solution , a static and spherically symmetric solution to hl gravity with vanishing cosmological constant . the geodesic motion in this space - time has been studied previously @xcite and a number of constraints on the parameters of hl gravity have been found .",
    "observables such as the perihelion shift and the light deflection were also studied in these papers , however , either approximations were used or only circular orbits were studied . in this paper we are aiming at solving the geodesic equation exactly by using numerical techniques and at exploring the complete set of solutions of the geodesic equation .    our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give the model and the black hole solutions . in section iii we give the geodesic equation , while section iv contains our results .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "the model proposed by hoava @xcite uses the adm decomposition of the metric that reads as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the lapse and shift functions , respectively , and @xmath9 is the 3-metric with @xmath10 . in @xcite",
    "it was assumed that the theory is invariant under space - independent time reparametrization and time - dependent spatial diffeomorphisms , i.e. under @xmath11 which restricts the lapse function to depend only on @xmath12 .",
    "the action proposed in @xcite then reads @xmath13 where @xmath14   \\ , \\",

    "@xmath21 is the cotton tensor and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants .",
    "the integrand of @xmath27 is interpreted as the potential part , while the integrand of @xmath28 is interpreted as the kinetic part .    in the ir",
    "limit the action is dominated by @xmath29 and reduces to the einstein - hilbert action for @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the speed of light , @xmath32 is newton s constant and @xmath33 is the cosmological constant .",
    "note that for @xmath34 , i.e. in particular for @xmath35 , the constant @xmath26 and hence @xmath33 should be negative . in the following we will set @xmath35 ( unless otherwise stated ) and consider the additional terms of @xmath36 as a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional modification of general relativity .",
    "the action as given above satisfies the requirement of detailed balance which essentially means that the potential @xmath37 in the hoava - lifshitz action derives from a superpotential @xmath38 : @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the dewitt metric .",
    "the requirement of detailed balance drastically reduces the number of invariants to consider in the potential @xmath37 .",
    "the problem with the theory as stated above is that for @xmath41 it predicts the wrong sign of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "moreover the detailed balance condition is chosen solely to simplify the theory .",
    "hence , theories that violate detailed balance have been considered . in @xcite",
    "the following term was added to the action @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary constant . in the @xmath44 limit which we are mainly interested in here",
    "the einstein - hilbert action is recovered in the ir for @xmath45      kehagias and sfetsos ( ks ) found a spherically symmetric , static black hole solution to a hoava - lifshitz gravity model with action @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath35 .",
    "the ansatz for the metric is @xmath48 and the solution reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is an integration constant . in @xcite constraints on the value of @xmath52 were found by comparing the perihelion shift in the ks space - time with observations in the solar system .",
    "it was found that @xmath53 for mercury , @xmath54 for mars and @xmath55 for saturn .",
    "moreover , a similar comparison gave @xmath56 for the s2 star orbiting the supermassive black hole in our galaxy as well as @xmath57 for extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "in @xcite constraints from innermost stellar circular orbits ( iscos ) for certain black holes were considered and it was found that @xmath58 ( in appropriate units ) . in @xcite the light deflection in the solar system was used to constrain the parameter .",
    "it was found that @xmath59 for earth , @xmath60 for jupiter and @xmath61 for the sun .",
    "the ir limit of ( [ sol_ks ] ) is given by the schwarzschild solution @xmath62 .",
    "the kretschmann scalar @xmath63 reads @xmath64 which for small @xmath65 behaves like @xmath66 .",
    "hence the solution possesses a physical singularity at @xmath0 @xcite and two horizons at @xmath67 as long as @xmath68 .",
    "note that the corrections from hoava - lifshitz gravity now allow for the existence of up to two horizons .",
    "the extremal solution has @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the hawking temperature of black hole solutions is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath23 is the surface gravity that for static solutions is given by @xmath72 for the ks solution we find @xmath73 which in the @xmath74 limit tends to the known schwarzschild result @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , the extremal solutions with @xmath70 have @xmath76 . for more details about the thermodynamics of black holes in hoava - lifshitz gravity",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",

    "this is what we are aiming at here .",
    "the integral on the right hand of ( [ sol_geo1 ] ) can not be solved in terms of hyperelliptic functions , at least not to our knowledge . however , an analytic treatment seems possible in some limiting cases .",
    "this will be reported elsewhere @xcite . in this paper",
    "we solve the geodesic equation ( [ geo1 ] ) numerically .",
    "in order to understand which types of orbits are possible in the ks space - time , we first study the effective potential . to make contact with the schwarzschild case we rewrite ( [ eq1 ] ) as follows @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 this effective potential becomes @xmath101 , which is just the effective potential in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "+    the first point to note is that while for @xmath102 the potential at @xmath103 behaves like @xmath104 ( this is just the schwarzschild limit ) , it behaves like @xmath105 for generic @xmath43 .",
    "hence there is a positive infinite angular momentum barrier for both massive and massless test particles which does not exist in the schwarzschild limit .",
    "the first conclusion is hence that test particles with non - vanishing angular momentum can not reach the singularity at @xmath0 in the ks space - time .",
    "moreover , for the extremal solution with @xmath106 we find that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .     and @xmath109 corresponding to the absolute minimum of the effective potential @xmath110 at small @xmath65 for different values of @xmath43 , @xmath111 and @xmath80 .",

    "+    on the other hand , for particles without angular momentum @xmath121 , the effective potential is always negative and behaves like @xmath122 for small @xmath65 , while it is equivalent to the schwarzschild potential for large @xmath65 : @xmath123 .      in figs .",
    "[ fig1a]-[fig1c ] we show how the effective potential @xmath110 for a massive test particle ( @xmath80 ) changes for different values of @xmath124 and @xmath43 and @xmath111 .    it is obvious that the effective potential at large @xmath65 does nt change much when decreasing @xmath43 from the schwarzschild limit @xmath125 .",
    "hence , the types of orbits available for large @xmath65 are very similar to the schwarzschild case .",
    "this is not surprising since hoava - lifshitz gravity is a gravity theory that is supposed to modify general relativity at short distances , but has no effects on the long distance physics . in comparison to the schwarzschild case",
    ", the effective potential possesses a further minimum at small @xmath65 .",
    "this is represented by the curves in fig.[fig2a ] . in this latter plot",
    ", we assume that @xmath112 is a parameter that can have all possible values to show that an additional minimum exists , but keep in mind that to find the zeros of @xmath114 we need to require @xmath126 .",
    "note that the value of this minimum is negative and always smaller than @xmath127 .",
    "it increases for decreasing @xmath43 and becomes equal to @xmath127 in the extremal limit .",

    "+    these observations lead to the following conclusion for the types of orbits possible which have turning points at the minimal radius @xmath128 close to @xmath0 : test particles would move on manyworld bound orbits ( mbo ) with @xmath129 or on two - world escape orbits ( teo ) with @xmath130 but can never reach @xmath0 . in comparison to bound orbits ( bo ) and escape orbits ( eo ) , respectively , test particles moving on manyworld or two - world orbits cross the two horizons in both directions .",
    "that this is always the case for orbits with @xmath131 close to @xmath0 can be seen as follows : since @xmath132 and the turning points are given by @xmath133 , the value of @xmath131 is always smaller than @xmath134 and the value of @xmath135 is always larger than @xmath136 . in the schwarzschild space - time manyworld or two - world orbits",

    "for this note that @xmath203 is in fact negative and we are giving the absolute value here such that the absolute value of @xmath203 decreases with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "the deflection of light by a ks black hole can be calculated by using ( [ eq2 ] ) for an escape orbit of a massless test particle ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the light deflection then reads @xmath204 where @xmath131 is the minimal radius of the orbit .",
    "our results for @xmath111 are shown in fig.[ld ] , where we give the value of the light deflection in dependence on the impact parameter @xmath205 , which is equal to @xmath206 in the case that the initial value of @xmath65 is equal to infinity .",
    "note that for values of @xmath207 larger than @xmath208 the massless test particle first encircles the black hole once or several times before going back to infinity . in fig.[ld1 ] we show the light deflection of the two - world escape orbit ( teo ) , while in fig.[ld2 ] we show the light deflection of the escape orbit ( eo ) .    for the latter case , we observe that the light deflection increases with decreasing impact parameter . this is very similar to the schwarzschild space - time . lowering the value of the impact parameter",
    "further we find that the light deflection diverges at a critical value @xmath209 .",
    "this critical value depends on @xmath43 and decreases with decreasing @xmath43 : at @xmath118 the value is close to the schwarzschild value @xmath210 , while @xmath211 for @xmath212 and @xmath213 for @xmath214 .",
    "lowering the impact parameter even further we find that the light deflection now decreases with decreasing impact parameter .",
    "this is a new feature as compared to the schwarzschild space - time , which however also exists in the reissner - nordstrm case @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained when considering the form of the effective potential .",
    "lowering the impact parameter @xmath205 is comparable to fixing @xmath124 and increasing the energy @xmath81 . for small value of @xmath81 ( large values of @xmath205 )",
    "there are three positive real zeros of @xmath114 and the corresponding orbits are a manyworld bound orbit ( mbo ) and an escape orbit ( eo ) . increasing @xmath81 ( decreasing @xmath205 ) we would then find a critical value of @xmath81 for which @xmath119 is equal to the value of the maximum of the effective potential .",
    "this corresponds to an unstable circular orbit for which the value of the light deflection diverges .",
    "increasing @xmath81 ( lowering @xmath205 ) further , @xmath119 has only one intersection point at positive @xmath65 with the effective potential and this corresponds to a two - world escape orbit ( teo ) .",
    "we also find that the light deflection for the escape orbit ( eo ) decreases with decreasing @xmath43 , while for the two - world escape orbits the dependence on @xmath43 depends on the value of the impact parameter . for very small impact parameter , the light deflection decreases with decreasing @xmath43 , while for @xmath205 close to @xmath215 it increases with decreasing @xmath43 .",
    "we can again compare with the schwarzschild case . for large impact parameter @xmath205 the light deflection in the schwarzschild space - time",
    "can be approximated by @xcite @xmath216 we have then computed @xmath207 for test particles with @xmath217 and different impact parameters @xmath218 in the ks space - time and set these values equal to @xmath219 to find the corresponding values @xmath190 .",
    "we find that for @xmath220 , @xmath111 we need to choose @xmath221 for impact parameter @xmath222 and @xmath223 for impact parameter @xmath224 , respectively , to get the same value of the light deflection . for increasing @xmath43 the corresponding @xmath190 decreases , e.g. @xmath225 for @xmath118 .",
    "the conclusion is very similar to the one in the case of the perihelion shift : to find the same value of the light deflection in the ks space - time as compared to the schwarzschild space - time the mass of the central body has to be smaller .",
    "@xmath131 of the escape orbit ( eo ) in the ks space - time is larger as compared to an escape orbit in the schwarzschild space - time for the same value of the light deflection .",
    "this would be another method to distinguish the ks space - time from the schwarzschild space - time and is shown in fig.[diff2 ] , where we give the difference @xmath192 for the escape orbit ( eo ) of a massless test particle in dependence on @xmath43 .",
    "again , we observe that @xmath202 decreases with increasing @xmath43 and increases with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the motion of massless and massive test particle in the space - time of the ks black hole , which is a static , spherically symmetric vacuum solution of hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity .",
    "we have taken the viewpoint that hoava - lifshitz gravity is essentially a short - distance modification of general relativity ( gr ) and have used the gr geodesic equation .",
    "we observe that there are some new features as compared to the static , spherically symmetric vacuum solution of gr , the schwarzschild solution . for massive test particles",
    "we find that next to bound orbits there exist manyworld bound orbits on which the test particles cross the two horizons in both directions . for massless test particles we can also have manyworld bound orbits , which do not exist in the schwarzschild case .",
    "there exist also escape orbits , which are comparable to the ones in the schwarzschild case as well as two - world escape orbits , which are a new feature .",
    "due to an infinite angular momentum barrier , test particles with non - vanishing angular momentum can never reach @xmath0 - in contrast to the schwarzschild case where particles that have crossed the event horizon unavoidably move to @xmath0 .",
    "massless test particles moving on radial geodesics will always go to @xmath0 , while massive test particles moving on these geodesics are either trapped on a manyworld radial geodesic if their energy @xmath226 or they will reach the singularity at @xmath0 for @xmath227 .    we have also computed the perihelion shift and the light deflection .",
    "the rate of the perihelion shift of the manyworld bound orbit is much larger than that of the bound orbit and for both orbits this rate decreases with decreasing @xmath43 , i.e. it is largest for both types of orbits in the schwarzschild limit .",
    "the light deflection increases with decreasing impact parameter for escape orbits , but decreases with decreasing impact parameter for two - world escape orbits . for escape orbits the light deflection is decreasing for decreasing @xmath43 , while for two - world escape orbits it decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) for small ( large ) impact parameter .",
    "approximate methods have been used in several other papers to constrain the value of the parameter @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "since we believe that constraints from orbits can only be obtained for large value of @xmath43 , i.e. close to the schwarzschild limit we have not attempted to recompute the constraints since we believe that our exact techniques would more or less give the same numbers as those found in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to solve the geodesic equation exactly and present the complete set of solutions to the geodesic equation .",
    "recently , the geodesic equation in another hoava - lifshitz black hole space - time has been solved analytically in terms of hyperelliptic functions @xcite .",
    "it seems possible that in some limiting cases of the ks black hole space - time considered here , we can also find analytic solutions .",
