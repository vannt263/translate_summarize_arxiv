    "since there is observational evidence for water associated with compact , young star clusters @xcite and the slope of the opacity functions with and without water ice are the same , we have left the dust with ice mantles throughout the entire geometric sequence .    fixing the cluster age is based on upper limits of the time it takes for a cluster to emerge from its envelope .",

    "the wavelength of the far - ir peak of the thermal grain emission depends on the predominant temperature of the dust in a model envelope . for the high column density envelopes , which have low sfe values and small r@xmath5 values , the uv light is absorbed in the inner portions of the envelope so that much of the envelope remains quite cold .",

    "in the milky way , individual embedded massive stars are surrounded by what have been identified as `` ultracompact hii regions '' ( uchiis ) , and it is hypothesized that the constituent massive stars in embedded sscs will also be surrounded by uchii regions .",
    "for this reason we compare our models to a sample of resolved embedded massive stars in order to test whether our models have reproduced , to first order , the necessary features of embedded massive stars .",
    "the sample is an iras sample studied in @xcite , in which it was found that 60% of the brightest iras sources ( @xmath91  jy at 100 ) in the color range of their galactic survey are uchii regions .",
    "@xcite also found that galactic uchii regions strictly obey a set of color criteria in the infrared with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , while very few other types of objects had iras colors fitting these criteria .",
    "therefore , these color criteria appear to be relatively robust for identifying uchii regions , and we might expect natal sscs to obey these criteria as well .",
    "we have convolved our model results with the iras filter profiles , and figure  [ plotwc ] shows the iras colors from a subset of our models compared to field objects ( plus signs ) and uchii regions ( diamonds ) from the @xcite survey ( which includes the @xcite sample ) . in this figure , we focus on only the family of models with a 10% stellar mass component and a relative fraction of clumpy dust of 90% , although the other model families have iras colors that are included in the range represented by the models shown .",
    "models with r@xmath83  pc are shown as red points , r@xmath94  pc as green points , and r@xmath95  pc as purple points .",
    "the values of r@xmath5 used are those shown in table  [ model_tree ] , and all sight - lines are shown for each set of model parameters , which produces additional scatter .",
    "there is good agreement between our models and the uchiis sample shown in figure  [ plotwc ] .",
    "there are a few of points to lower left and upper right that are not traced by our models .",
    "the lower left points have very hot dust in the inner portions of their envelopes , and might be modeled with a smaller r@xmath5 value that puts the hot dust closer to the heating source .",
    "the points to upper right seem to be an extension of the basic trend of increasing r@xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore possible that we could reproduce these uchiis if we simply assumed a lower mass cutoff to our cluster which would lower the uv flux incident on the inner envelope .    ]",
    "here we discuss some of the limitations of the models as a guide for future improvements .",
    "( @xmath12 ) the models assume that the central star cluster is a point source . while optical measurements have discovered half - light radii of super star clusters of @xmath96pc on average @xcite , which is significantly smaller than the assumed outer envelope radii , it is nevertheless more realistic to place several ultracompact hii regions at the center of the envelope ( see figure  [ clusterevolution ] ) .",
    "the intracluster dust would be heated at early evolutionary stages if multiple , smaller clusters were used , creating a hotter dust component than is seen with the current models .",
    "( @xmath66 ) variations in metallicity have not been considered . for small changes in metallicity ( i.e. down to half or third solar metallicity ) ,",
    "we expect the dust - to - gas ratio to scale with metallicity .",
    "however , more extreme environments , like blue compact dwarf galaxies , where metallicities are often much lower than this , show dust in excess to what is expected from their metallicity alone ( t. x. thuan , private communication ) . accounting for very low metallicities is therefore a complicated issue that is probably best handled on an individual basis .",
    "( @xmath62 ) the evolutionary sequences presented in this paper do not allow the central star cluster to evolve .",
    "as described in  [ obsevidence ] , the time between cluster formation and the dispersal of the embedding envelope is short , on the order of @xmath97 myr .",
    "however , the dispersal rate is not well known , so we have not made any attempt to place time stamps on the evolutionary sequence presented here .",
    "hydrodynamical models are needed to answer this problem , and several hydrodynamical and semi - analytical studies of super star clusters already exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rate at which the envelope is dispersed could potentially be answered by similar studies of a super star cluster s embedded phase .",
    "( @xmath50 ) this work has concentrated solely on the dust emission and absorption in embedded super star clusters .",
    "inclusion of nebular line emission in the model spectra could be useful if line diagnostics could be identified that break the model degeneracies .",
    "( @xmath20 ) the models do not include an interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) incident on the outside of the dusty envelope .",
    "an isrf would heat the dust on the outside of the envelope and provide an additional component to the starlight visible in the uv / optical / near - ir regime .",
    "this could affect the [ @xmath3-[@xmath8 color used to distinguish between different fractions of clumpy dust .",
    "the heating of the outer envelope could affect the far - ir fluxes as well .",
    "we present seds and colors of embedded sscs created using spherical three - dimensional models . by varying the input parameters according to a series of evolutionary sequences , we have created a suite of models that can be used to constrain the evolutionary state of an embedded super star cluster .",
    "the main conclusions of the study are :        ( @xmath62 ) the infrared sed also varies with sightline in these clumpy models , which has an impact on the near- and mid - infrared colors and magnitudes , the strength of the observed silicate features , and the dust continuum measured at these wavelengths ;    ( @xmath50 ) for the smooth dust distribution models , the evolutionary sequences that begin with mid - infrared obscure envelopes ( a@xmath98 ) are marked by a gradual decline in the silicate absorption features at @xmath0 and @xmath65   and a corresponding increase in the visual and ultraviolet flux as the cluster envelope evolves .",
    "those sequences that begin with infrared - transparent envelopes ( a@xmath99 ) instead have a predominant hot dust component and silicates in emission at early stages that eventually both fade away as the inner envelope radius moves outward .",
    "the clumpy envelope acts to confuse these general trends , making it harder to determine envelope properties .",
    "( @xmath20 ) several diagnostic colors were found to constrain the envelope properties .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "mips [ @xmath1-[@xmath2 color is found to be a good diagnostic of the star formation efficiency , particularly at separating very low and high values ( such as @xmath20% and @xmath31% ) from more moderate values ( between @xmath28% and @xmath30% ) .",
    "the [ @xmath3-[@xmath8 color can be used to determine the fraction of clumpy dust in the envelope for large samples of embedded super star clusters , but not for individual sources ( see  [ colors ] for details ) . in order to determine the r@xmath5 and r@xmath6 values ,",
    "the [ @xmath7-[@xmath4 color can be used for r@xmath5/r@xmath100 . below this value",
