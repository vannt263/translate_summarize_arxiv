    "this transition is driven by natural selection , unlike the secondary mating differentiation mechanisms in allopatry , which are expected to operate by genetic drift and hence to be slower .",

    "<S> modes of speciation have been the subject of a century s debate . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , most speciations are believed to be caused by spatial separation of populations ( _ allopatry _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations  @xcite and models  @xcite , show that speciation can also take place in _ </S>",
    "<S> sympatry_. we discuss a comprehensive model of coupled differentiation in phenotype , mating , and space , showing that spatial segregation can be an induced process following a sympatric differentiation . </S>",
    "<S> this is found to be a generic mechanism of adaptation to heterogeneous environments , for which we propose the term _ diapatric _ speciation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it explains the ubiquitous spatial patching of newly formed species , despite their sympatric origin  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> allopatric speciation occurs in populations extending over a sufficient range in space and time . </S>",
    "<S> if subpopulations become spatially isolated , they can diverge in phenotype by adaptation to different environments as well as by genetic drift . </S>",
    "<S> a similar divergence is possible while the subpopulations maintain a limited spatial contact @xcite , which is commonly referred to as _ </S>",
    "<S> parapatric _ </S>",
    "<S> speciation . pre- or post - mating incompatibilities can develop subsequently , leading to reproductive isolation . neither the primary phenotypic separation nor the secondary reproductive isolation require disruptive selection . </S>",
    "<S> hence , allopatric or classical parapatric speciation may well take too much space and time to account for radiation events and rapid species divergence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in recent years , phylogeographic observations have produced convincing evidence for speciation in sympatry . </S>",
    "<S> reproductive isolation has occurred in cichlid populations in african lakes over a few thousand generations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a salmon population is reported to have separated within only 14 generations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sympatric speciation thus appears to occur rapidly even in small contiguous environments without spatial barriers . in theoretical models </S>",
    "<S> , it is always driven by _ </S>",
    "<S> disruptive selection_. a phenotypic split can be favored , for example , if individuals of similar phenotype compete more strongly than distant ones @xcite . in a sexually reproducing population , however , such splits can only happen if the subpopulations become reproductively isolated so that the birth of hybrids is suppressed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the sympatric scenario can not explain the spatial population structure observed in the phylogeographic studies . </S>",
    "<S> spatial patching of subpopulations appears to be ubiquitous . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the sister species of cichlids tend to organize themselves into neighboring regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another well - documented case are phytophagous insects , which are found to evolve mating assortativity together with specificity to different host plants  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations call for a more comprehensive model that captures the divergence in phenotypic traits , mating , and space as a cooperative dynamical process . </S>",
    "<S> only recently ibm simulations in an extended model space with environmental fitness gradient have been presented @xcite extending previous studies with complete spatial mixing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the model discussed here addresses parapatric speciation , i.e. , generic intermediate cases between sympatry and allopatry . </S>",
    "<S> it affords a detailed analysis of the dynamics , allowing us to identify different primary speciation mechanisms and their conditions of occurence . </S>",
    "<S> ( a concise discussion of classification issues and of the appropriate terminology can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the basic evolutionary forces driving speciation can be captured by a deterministic `` reaction - diffusion '' approach . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the role of stochastic effects as they appear in individual - based models . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we recover the well - known mechanisms of allopatric and sympatric speciation . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are many environments with inhomogeneities on smaller scales in space and time ( such as in the examples quoted above ) , where spatial variations prevent sympatry and diffusive migration prevents allopatry . </S>",
    "<S> adaptative evolution then operates by a new mechanism , for which we propose the term _ </S>",
    "<S> diapatric speciation_. the population reaches a final state of efficient spatial patchiness and phenotypic differentation without hybrids , which is triggered and sustained by assortative mating . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the traditional view of parapatric speciation , where assortative mating takes a merely secondary role in reinforcing an existing boundary between emerging species @xcite . </S>"
