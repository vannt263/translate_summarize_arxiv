    "wind energy , known as the most widely used form of clean and renewable generation resource in power systems , is increasing its penetration around the world .",
    "europe , asia , and north america will have an exponential yearly increase in the amount of added wind power capacity by 2020 @xcite .",
    "the increase in wind energy makes the generation side less controllable due to the intermittent feature of wind . as a consequence ,",
    "building level demand side management ( dsm ) for thermostatic load becomes a crucial part that can be achieved generally through either a price - based signalling control @xcite-@xcite or a non - priced _ direct load control _ ( dlc ) .",
    "compared with pricing mechanism , the operator in dlc can have better understanding of the loads response in order to provide short time scale regulation services @xcite .",
    "dlc approaches on thermostatic loads have been studied extensively during the past decade for difference purposes , including load shifting , load smoothing , and load following .",
    "a primitive investigation on load shifting has been studied with a state queuing model to illustrate the effect of set - point change @xcite .",
    "it is shown that even a simple step change will result in a complicated load profile due to the instantly change of loads status .",
    "taking into account both the appliances duty cycle as well as probabilistic consumer behaviour , a steady state appliances population distribution during an load shifting demand response is analysed in @xcite .",
    "results shows that the steady state distribution exists and may not be as simple as uniform .",
    "more recently , the possibility to integrate dlc into load smoothing or following is investigated .",
    "the notion of packetized dlc is proposed in @xcite to smooth electricity consumption with shortened appliances duty cycle .",
    "load following can also be found in @xcite-@xcite where various of control methods including discrete time directly on / off actuation control , set point shifting , as well as model based predictive control are used .",
    "results in these papers show that loads , by acting as both a positive and negative generation source , is a promising resource to response against the load request from the iso to maintain supply demand balance .    while the study of the dlc itself seems to be comprehensive ,",
    "there are two issues remain to be answered .",
    "the first one is the limitation of regulation provision , namely what is the maximum regulation can be provided by a specific provider given its implicit features such as population of appliances pool , parameters in its own model .",
    "the second one is about the information exchange between the iso and the providers . instead of the one way command - like signalling",
    ", can we design another framework such that the iso can get feedback information from providers ?",
    "if so , how beneficial is it to the real time operation ?",
    "the objective of this paper is to answer these questions by developing a two layer feedback control system .",
    "we focus primarily on smart buildings that are operated by a central operator who has the authority to shift the set point of thermostatic appliances within the building .",
    "consumers are assumed to authorize the operator to control their set point once they provide the allowable set point range .",
    "it will be shown that the operator in the lower feedback layer can design a feedback control law to track the iso regulation signal within a certain ramping rate .",
    "the higher feedback loop is designed between the iso and buildings where the former dispatches real time signals and the latter send back information to characterize their instant - by - instant capability to respond .",
    "we also derive analytically the maximum possible regulation that can be provided from buildings based on two considerations  the capability to provide long term accumulated and short term ( one step ) ramping regulation .",
    "it is further shown that two fundamental parameters determining the capability are the building thermal constant @xmath0 and appliances temperature gain @xmath1 .",
    "large @xmath0 enables the building to provide larger long term , but smaller short term regulation service .",

    "section [ two level feedback system design ] gives the overall design of the two layer feedback system in which we first introduce the lower layer controller with feedback linearization , followed by the investigation of maximum possible regulation provision , and then the higher level feedback design that includes a quadratic program to optimally dispatch real time regulation to individual buildings .",

    "fig.6 is the simulation result with only lower level controller .",
    "we find that both systems can track the regulation signal when it ramps up or down with the design of building level feedback controller , but they differ in the maximum ability of tracking . compared with fig.6 , where individual building regulation signals are proportional to their maximum provision level ( iso does not have knowledge about real time building information , so it dispatches signals proportional to their a prior maximum commitment ) , the signals in fig.5 are determined by solving the @xmath152 .",
    "we find that the consumption trend of red curve and blue curve are different most of the time in fig.5 that fully exploits their tracking capability , while in fig.6 individual building consumptions follow the same trend with proportionality .",
    "the accumulated generation of spinning reserves is reduced when the regulation dispatch is optimized by the @xmath152 , and the distribution of spinning reserve is more concentrated around @xmath203 with smaller variance .",
    "tab.1 shows the statistics of both systems , the total spinning generation is reduced by @xmath204 after optimization .",
    "the standard deviation , maximum , and minimum spinning generation is reduced by @xmath205 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 respectively .",
    "furthermore , at times when the regulation signal ramps up and down at a fast speed , for example at 15 , 30 , 35 , 40 , and 50 minutes , the performance of the two level structured system in fig.5 is better than the system performance without the design .",
    "this is because the required spinning reserves is largely reduced despite the sharp ramping regulation signal .",
    "to sum , the proposed two level feedback framework outperforms the system with only building level controller design .",

    "fig.7(a ) shows the real and estimated value of two sample states , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , these are the two states around the boundary of the comfort band that will affect the change in electricity consumption .",
    "we can see that the estimation error for these two boundary states approach zero after 20 minutes .",
    "fig.7(b ) shows the convergence speed of the norm decay of the error vector @xmath171 for appliances with different duty cycles .",
    "the norm converges to zero after 20 minutes when the duty cycle is 10 minutes , and converges to zero after 35 minutes when the duty cycle is 20 minutes .",
    "this is because smaller duty cycle enables a larger allowable control set , i.e the system has large values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 to prevent from saturation . in fig.7(c ) and fig.7(d ) we compare the distribution of control signals across the allowable control set , it can be seen that the control signal stays further away from saturation for system having smaller duty cycle .",
    "such systems have a larger convergence speed of the error vector .",
    "[ observer_result ]",
    "this paper proposes an innovative two level feedback design system for the real time regulation provision .",
    "the lower level building feedback controller allows the building operator to track a given signal from the iso , and the higher level information feedback from individual buildings to the iso allows the latter to optimally dispatch real time regulation signals to multiple providers by solving a quadratic programming problem such that the cost of spinning reserves is reduced . during the development of the system",
    ", we also derive analytically the building s limitation on both long term and short term regulation provision and provide intuitive explanations that match our theoretical results . to counter the problem with effective measuring",
    ", we also proposed an observer design to reduce the error of state estimation such that the feedback controller can work well .",
    "simulation results indicate that the proposed framework is superior in reducing the amount of real time spinning reserve .",
    "future work will include the modelling of similar two level feedback system but with price based signalling between the operator and the consumers .",
    "such design will fit into problems where consumers do not authorize the operator to directly control their set point .",
    "it is expected that price - based mechanism has looser control compared with the direct load control because consumers can choose their own utility function .",
    "consequently , it enables consumers to obtain different level of desired comfort .",

    "<S> demand side management has gained increasing importance as the penetration of renewable energy grows . </S>",
    "<S> based on a markov jump process modelling of a group of thermostatic loads , this paper proposes a two level feedback system design between the independent system operator ( iso ) and the regulation service provider such that two objectives are achieved : ( 1 ) the iso can optimally dispatch regulation signals to multiple providers in real time in order to reduce the requirement for expensive spinning reserves , and ( 2 ) each regulation provider can control its thermostatic loads to respond the iso signal . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the amount of regulation service that can be provided is implicitly restricted by a few fundamental parameters of the provider itself , such as the allowable set point choice and its thermal constant . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting finding is that the regulation provider s ability to provide a large amount of long term accumulated regulation and short term signal tracking restrict each other . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the performance of the proposed framework . </S>"
