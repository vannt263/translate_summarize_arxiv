    "galaxies are the primary tracers by which astronomers map and measure the universe , so understanding how galaxies form and evolve is a longstanding central goal of astronomy .",
    "the physics of galaxy formation involves a diverse set of processes spanning an enormous dynamic range , from black holes and stellar physics on sub - parsec scales to cosmology and large - scale structure on gigaparsec scales . as a consequence , despite rapidly advancing observations of galaxies across cosmic time , a comprehensive theory for the formation and evolution of galaxies that can explain all their observed properties remains elusive .    as galaxies are essentially collections of stars , understanding the growth of the stellar component of galaxies is of fundamental importance .",
    "recent observations have probed the star formation rates and stellar masses of galaxies out to redshift @xmath8 .",
    "key trends have emerged .",
    "for instance , fairly massive galaxies are in place at early epochs , and galaxies exhibit  downsizing \" in the sense that more massive galaxies form their stars earlier and have lower birthrates today . while some claim that these trends are in conflict with expectations from hierarchical structure formation , they are actually not .",
    "since the most massive galaxies form within the largest mass density peaks , they collapse first and start forming stars earlier than lower - mass systems  @xcite .",
    "the collapse is driven by gravitational instability and strong radiative cooling that ( left unchecked ) grow galaxies very rapidly at early epochs , so that models without strong feedback yield galaxies that are _ too large _ at high redshifts  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note that no confirmed high-@xmath9 galaxy yet observed is too large to be produced in a hierarchical model , and in fact strong feedback appears to be necessary to suppress galaxy formation from the earliest epochs .",
    "the evolution of galaxy stellar masses and star formation rates therefore provide valuable insights into the processes , particularly related to feedback , that drive galaxy formation from the highest redshift until today .",
    "the canonical scenario for galaxy formation posits that galaxies assemble first as rotationally - supported disks cooling out of virial - temperature gas within a dark matter halo  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and then such objects merge to form larger and earlier - type systems  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . naively , one expects then that star - forming disks would be surrounded by hot gaseous halos  @xcite , and that early low - mass objects would tend to be disky while more massive objects would be ellipticals .",
    "recent observations , however , do not clearly support this paradigm .",
    "for instance , star - forming disks and hot ( x - ray emitting ) gaseous halos are rarely if ever found together  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* though see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "observed dynamics of @xmath10 galaxies indicate that larger objects tend to be disky , while smaller ones are dispersion - dominated  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , galaxies appear to be consuming their gas rapidly enough that fuel must be constantly replenished  @xcite , but merger - induced starbursts do not appears to be driving global star formation  @xcite .",
    "hence there is some doubt that the canonical halo / merger - centric view provides the appropriate framework for galaxy formation , despite the wide - ranging successes that models based on this have enjoyed  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "improvements in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations over the past decade have made them a competitive approach towards understanding the physics of galaxy formation in a hierarchical structure formation context .",
    "the complex three - dimensional geometry of large - scale structure is self - consistently evolved together with the baryonic components that make up observable galaxies and the co - evolving intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "these simulations have long suggested that accretion onto galaxies is powered by cold , filamentary streams that connect to the cosmic web on larger scales  @xcite , and that most accreted gas fueling star formation never heats to the virial temperature  @xcite .",
    "gas replenishment from the igm is a natural outcome of this model , and generally occurs smoothly rather than being driven by major mergers  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these simulations provide many insights into how galaxies form and grow , some of which are in common with the traditional scenario , while some differ .",
    "recently , simulations incorporating strong and ubiquitous outflows have had success matching a wide range of data on galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the igm  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outflow models in these simulations were originally tuned to enrich the igm in accord with observations of @xmath11 absorbers  @xcite .",
    "the favoured scalings turn out to be those expected for momentum - conserved winds  @xcite , namely that the wind speed scales with circular ( or escape ) velocity , while the amount of mass ejected per unit star formation ( i.e. the mass loading factor ) scales inversely with it .",
    "this provides sufficiently early igm enrichment by expelling the majority of metals formed in small high - redshift galaxies , while having moderate wind speeds that does not to over - heat the igm  @xcite . in subsequent work",
    "we showed that an outflow model with similar scalings consistently does as well or better than any other outflow model that we have tried at matching a wide range of igm properties .",
    "we note that the actual implementation of this wind model in our simulations has evolved owing to advances in modeling techniques and changes in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "successes include very early ( @xmath12 ) enrichment  @xcite , absorbers at low-@xmath9  ( with the introduction of a physically - motivated igm turbulence model * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the metallicities in intragroup and intracluster gas  @xcite , and the overall cosmic metal distribution  .",
    "examining galaxy properties , we again found that an outflow model following similar scalings was the most successful amongst the ones we tried .",
    "successes included matching the mass - metallicity relation at @xmath13  @xcite , the shape of the present - day stellar mass function  @xcite below @xmath5 , damped ly@xmath14 absorber kinematics  @xcite , and observations of very high-@xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) galaxies  @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that this particular outflow model matches all the data ; in fact , it does not , it simply does better than others attempted , including the oft - used @xcite model .",
    "moreover , the implementation remains highly heuristic , and may be impacted by numerical effects  ( e.g. see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the consistent ( comparative ) success of an outflow model with momentum - driven wind scalings suggests that it captures some essential ingredients required for a successful model of galactic outflows , and motivates a more detailed investigation of the implications of such outflows .",
    "two key predictions from models incorporating outflows with such scalings are that ( i )",
    "the total amount of material ejected from galaxies significantly exceeds that going into stars  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter od08 ) ; and ( ii ) the ejected material often re - accretes onto galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the strong and ubiquitous ejection and re - accretion of material suggest that galaxies are best viewed as evolving within an ecosystem of surrounding intergalactic gas with which they continually exchange mass , energy , and metals .",
    "while the above results are encouraging , these simulations have yet to be comprehensively tested against observations of galaxy evolution from the present epoch back into the early universe .",
    "such a comparison would provide the most stringent test to date of how well these simulations can reproduce the observed universe , and would better highlight the current successes and failures of galaxy evolution simulations .",
    "this series of papers aims to understand how basic galaxy statistics and scaling relations between their stellar , gas , and metal content constrain the physics of galaxy formation . in paper i ( this paper )",
    "we focus on the statistics of and scaling relations between stellar mass and star formation rate . in paper ii ( dav , finlator , & oppenheimer , in prep . )",
    "we will additionally investigate the gas and metal content of galaxies .",
    "the primary goal of these works is to understand and characterise the key physical processes that drive the observable properties of galaxies across cosmic time .    in these papers",
    ", we will demonstrate that for a particular choice of outflow model , namely outflows following scalings as expected for momentum - driven winds , the simulations can reproduce key observations of scaling relations between stars , gas , and metals for large star - forming galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation .",
    "this is a first for cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "however , all simulations we examine here fail to match selected galaxy properties at high and low masses , indicating that additional or different physics is required even for our most successful model . using insights gained from the simulations ,",
    "we show that relations between basic galaxy constituents can be broadly understood through a simple scenario in which inflows are balanced by outflows and star formation .",
    "this contrasts with the canonical halo / merger - centric model of galaxy formation ; in our scenario , the dark matter halo s virial radius and galaxy mergers play a sub - dominant role in the evolution of star - forming systems .",
    "we argue that galactic outflows are the key moderator of the stellar content , star formation rate , and gas and metal evolution in galaxies at all epochs . in turn , observations of these properties provide valuable constraints on the cosmic ecosystem within which galaxies form and grow .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : sims ] we describe our hydrodynamic simulations including our galactic outflow model . in  [ sec : msfrfcn ] we investigate the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions , and explain the three - tier behavior generically seen in wind simulations by invoking differential wind recycling . in ",
    "[ sec : ssfr ] we look at the scaling relation between sfr and @xmath1 and its evolution to high-@xmath9 , emphasizing its connection with the matter accretion rate into halos . in  [ sec : sat ] we further break down these trends in terms of centrals vs. satellite galaxies , and raise some issues regarding observed dwarf galaxies that none of the models reproduce .",
    "finally , we summarise and discuss the broader implications of our work in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our simulations are run with an extended version of the gadget-2  n - body + smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code ( * ? ? ?",

    "our primary runs use the boxsize of @xmath23 on a side with @xmath24 dark matter and @xmath24 gas particles . to expand our dynamic range we also run two additional sets of simulations that are identical except that they have box sizes of @xmath25 and @xmath23 , and have only @xmath26 particles of each species .",
    "the particle masses and gravitational softening lengths are listed in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "an overview of the gadget-2  code can be found in  2 of k09a .",
    "additions to the public version of the code include cooling processes using the primordial abundances as described in @xcite and metal - line cooling as described in @xcite .",
    "star formation is modeled using a subgrid recipe introduced in @xcite where a gas particle above a critical density is modeled as a fraction of cold clouds embedded in a warm ionised medium following @xcite .",
    "star formation ( sf ) follows a schmidt law @xcite with the sf timescale scaled to match the @xmath4 kennicutt law @xcite .",
    "the density threshold for sf is @xmath27 .",
    "we use a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) throughout .",
    "the fraction of mass of the imf going into massive stars , defined here as @xmath28 and assumed to result in type ii supernovae ( sne ) , is @xmath29 ; for reference , a salpeter imf has @xmath30",
    ".    our simulations directly account for metal enrichment from sources including type ii supernovae ( sne ) , type ia sne , and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "gas particles eligible for sf undergo self - enrichment from type ii sne using the instantaneous recycling approximation , where mass , energy , and metallicity are assumed to immediately return to the ism .",
    "type ii sn metal enrichment uses the metallicity - dependent yields calculated from the @xcite sne models .",
    "our prescriptions for feedback , described below , also assume the instantaneous input of energy from o and b stars ( i.e. stars that are part of @xmath31 ) .",
    "we input the type ia sne rates of @xcite , where an instantaneous component is tied to the sfr , and a delayed component is proportional to the stellar mass as described in od08 .",
    "each type ia sn adds @xmath32 ergs of thermal energy and the calculated metal yields of @xcite to surrounding gas ; the mass returned is small compared to that from type ii sne .",
    "agb stellar enrichment occurs on delayed timescales from 30 myrs to 14 gyrs , using a star particle s age and metallicity to calculate mass loss rates and metallicity yields as described in od08 .",
    "agb mass and metal loss is returned to the three nearest surrounding gas particles .",
    "od08 showed that the largest effect of agb stars is to replenish the ism , because a star particle can lose over 30% of its mass over @xmath33 , nearly double the @xmath34 that is recycled instantaneously via type ii sne .",
    "galactic outflows are implemented using a monte carlo approach analogous to star formation .",
    "outflows are directly tied to the sfr , using the relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the _ mass loading factor_. the probabilities for a gas particle to spawn a star particle is calculated as described above , and the probability to be launched in a wind is @xmath36 times that . if the particle is selected to be launched , it is given an additional velocity of @xmath37 in the direction of * v*@xmath38*a * , where * v * and * a * are the particle s instantaneous velocity and acceleration , respectively ; this would create a bipolar outflow for a thin disk , but in practice the outflow has a much larger opening angle .",
    "this subgrid model circumvents our inability to resolve the detailed physics of the ism that generates winds , at the cost of introducing additional parameters .",
    "choices of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 define the  wind model \" .",
    "once a gas particle is launched , its hydrodynamic ( not gravitational ) forces are turned off until either @xmath39 years have passed or , more often , the gas particle has reached 10% of the sf critical density .",
    "this is intended to simulate the formation of hot chimneys extending out of a disk galaxy providing a low resistance avenue for outflows to escape into the igm , which the spherically - averaged sph algorithm at our current resolution is incapable of resolving .",
    "however , explicit decoupling neglects energy losses owing to the initial creation of such channels as well as any drag along their interfaces , and as such can not drive turbulence in the ism .",
    "we note that decoupling has a significant impact on wind propagation ; simulations without such decoupling explored e.g. by @xcite show that decoupling greatly enhances the ability of material to escape a galaxy s ism .",
    "hence decoupling must be regarded as an integral part of the wind models described in this work , having a significant impact on the results , particularly those associated with recycling of wind material ( which would be much more prevalent if the hydrodynamic forces were never turned off ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this decoupling achieves resolution convergence in the cosmic star formation history .",
    "we will later explicitly demonstrate resolution convergence for many of the galaxy properties of interest here .",

    "this does not even account for radiative energy input from massive stars , which can exceed the energy output from supernovae .",
    "these wind models allow us to illustrate how outflows impact the scaling relations of galaxies .",
    "an important difference comes from the wind speed scaling : in the momentum - conserved outflows case , the wind speed is typically around the galaxy escape velocity , and scales with it .",
    "hence in this model , the potential well of the galaxy does not play a governing role in wind dynamics as a function of mass .",
    "this stands in contrast to the canonical model for outflows  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which outflows escape from small galaxies owing to their small potential wells while being recaptured in large galaxies .",
    "if gravity was the only relevant force , this model should show exactly the same escape fraction of outflowing material from galaxies of all masses .",
    "in actuality , hydrodynamic slowing plays an important role  @xcite , and because more massive galaxies live in denser gaseous environments , this retards winds more around more massive galaxies , causing greater return of wind material to these systems  @xcite .    the constant-@xmath36 models ( sw and cw ) behave more like the canonical model for winds , in the sense that at low galaxy masses their ( constant - velocity ) winds can escape the potential well , while at high masses they can not .",
    "one can envision this as an  effective \" mass loading factor that is roughly the input value of 2 at small masses , but drops to zero at large masses  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can view this as rapid recycling of wind material back into galaxies at high masses  @xcite . in any case",
    ", the constant wind speed imparts a feature at a mass scale corresponding to where the assumed wind velocity is comparable to the galaxy escape velocity . because of the different wind speeds in cw and sw , this feature should occur at different masses ( roughly a factor of eight apart in halo mass , given the factor of two difference in wind speeds ) .",
    "hence comparing these two models enables us to identify features in scaling relations that are related to how the effective mass loading factor scales with mass ; this is discussed extensively in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. their figure  4 ) . as we will argue later , it is the scaling of the ( effective ) mass loading factor with @xmath1 that primarily governs most galaxy scaling relations .",
    "our twelve runs are listed in table [ tab : sims ] .",
    "they were run at the university of arizona s sgi cluster , ice , the national center for supercomputing applications intel cluster , abe , and the university of massachusetts xeon cluster , eagle .",
    "each run took between 100,000 and 150,000 cpu hours , although nearly 1 million cpu hours were used when including smaller box sizes and various test runs .",
    "we note that due to technical difficulties , we only have galaxy catalogs for the r24 runs at @xmath97 , and do not have any information regarding satellite galaxies in these runs .",
    "however , all the important trends can be seen from the other runs at the redshifts where the r24 runs are not available .",
    "we emphasize that all these models are heuristic and intended only to explore how these wind scalings impact galaxy properties .",
    "we are not directly advocating any particular physical process , though we are attempting to use physically - motivated recipes .",
    "in particular , the momentum - driven wind scalings can arise from models that only employ supernova energy to drive winds , owing to the interactions of super - heated ism material with surrounding gas  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence the name  momentum - driven \" is only intended to indicate the scalings rather than a detailed physical model .",
    "nevertheless , owing to its prominence in this paper and others , we briefly discuss some issues related to the physics of the momentum - driven scalings wind model .",
    "the basic physical motivation is a model in which radiation pressure drives dust outwards , which couples to the gas to generate an outflow  @xcite .",
    "first , it is important to note that the momentum input required to drive winds at hundreds of km / s with mass loading factors as assumed above significantly exceeds the photon momentum emitted by the stellar populations  ( m. haas & j. schaye , priv .",
    "we show this ratio in table  [ tab : sims ] , and is a factor of 5.2 for our r48n384vzw simulation models , but in this case the physical motivation is supernova energy , so the momentum input is not relevant . ] following @xcite , this is calculated from the luminosity of stars for a solar - metallicity @xmath78  yr old stellar population assuming a @xcite imf , divided by @xmath98 .",
    "the large value indicates that momentum alone , under the assumption of single photon scattering , can not power the outflows in the vzw model .",
    "it is possible that subsequent re - radiation of photons could cause significantly more momentum deposition than what is emitted by the stars if the gas is optically thick to infrared radiation . for an infrared optical depth of @xmath99",
    ", momentum deposition is increased by @xmath100 .",
    "this factor can only be significantly greater than unity in highly dense gas where young stars form .",
    "@xcite computed @xmath99 in simulations of radiation - driven winds from high - resolution disk galaxies , and indeed found that in some cases @xmath99 can approach an order of magnitude , driving an outflow velocity of @xmath101  km / s leaving the disk with mass loading factors of order unity . while this is encouraging , the issue of whether enough momentum is available from stars , and whether it can effectively couple to the dust and in turn to the gas , remains an open question .",
    "another possibility is that supernovae and photons from young stars work together to drive winds  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "invariably , this must be happening at some level , since both processes are energetically comparable .",
    "* figure 2.19 ) showed that the momentum from sne can be an order of magnitude larger than that from stellar radiation at @xmath78  yr after the burst , although it drops rapidly with time .",
    "@xcite showed that for a 300  km / s wind , radiation pressure can yield a mass loading factor up to @xmath102 in the single - scattering regime , which is factors of many less than what our momentum - driven wind scalings require .",
    "hence supernova momentum input would have to dominate overall , particularly at large radii where the optical depth to absorb photons becomes small . despite being driven primarily by supernovae and not radiation pressure ,",
    "the scalings predicted in this scenario continue to follow those expected for momentum - driven winds  @xcite .    in short ,",
    "the momentum - driven wind scalings that we have assumed challenge the available momentum budget , but could plausibly arise from a combination of physical processes .",
    "much work remains to be done to marry large - scale constraints from cosmological simulations with detailed studies of wind expulsion from star - forming regions .",
    "we use skid ( spline kernel interpolative denmax ) to identify galaxies as bound groups of star - forming gas and stars  @xcite .",
    "since we specifically include just star - forming gas , our simulated galaxies only account for gas within the galactic ism and not from the extended halo ; this defines the galaxy s gas mass .",
    "our galaxy stellar mass limit is set to be @xmath103 star particles  @xcite , resulting in the masses listed under @xmath104 in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "we will argue that for the no - wind case the resolution convergence is poorer , and we list approximate masses that show convergence .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we will only consider galaxies with stellar mass @xmath105 in our analysis .",
    "we separate galaxies into central and satellite galaxies by associating each galaxy with a halo .",
    "we identify halos via a spherical overdensity algorithm  @xcite . in brief , we begin at the center of each galaxy and expand out spherically until the mean density enclosed equals that of a virialized halo  @xcite .",
    "we then subsume all galaxies whose centers are within that of a larger galaxy s halo into that larger halo . in this way , each galaxy is a member of one and only one halo . the central galaxy is the largest one that is at the center of the halo , and any other galaxies within that halo are satellites .",

    "* @xmath109 , curves ) .",
    "these were selected as fairly recent determinations of the stellar mass function from some of the deepest available near - infrared observations , though it is far from a complete sample of available data .",
    "the curves represent schechter function best fits , while the data points ( from different samples ) give an indication of the uncertainties .",
    "note that the @xcite data plotted at @xmath110 is actually centered at @xmath111 , but the evolution is not rapid during this period . also , we have scaled all data to a @xcite imf ( as assumed in the simulations ) , by dividing the stellar masses by 1.25 for those quoted using a diet salpeter imf  ( namely , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by 1.8 for those quoted using a salpeter imf  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a @xcite imf which is very similar to chabrier , so we apply no imf correction .",
    "finally , the @xcite data has been corrected to @xmath112 ; all other data shown assumed this value for the hubble constant .",
    "a test of numerical resolution convergence is provided by comparing the solid , dotted , and dashed lines for each model , which are from the r48n384 , r24n256 , and r48n256 series of runs , respectively .",
    "the difference in mass resolution between r48n384 and r48n256 is a factor of 2.4 , while between r48n384 and r24n256 it is 3.3 ; without accounting for this , convergence will appear slightly better at low resolution .",
    "in actuality , for the wind models at every redshift the gsmfs show very good convergence ( modulo some stochastic fluctuations at the massive end ) , and the faint end of the higher - resolution run joins smoothly onto that of the larger - volume run . for the no - wind simulations ,",
    "this is not the case : the higher - resolution run deviates from the lower - resolution run at a @xmath1 that is much larger than the nominal 64 star particle galaxy mass resolution .",
    "the reason can be traced back to resolution convergence for halos , as opposed to galaxies : halos also require approximately 64 particles to robustly host galaxies , and in the no - wind case this corresponds to a much higher @xmath1 than in the wind models where star formation at a given halo mass is much suppressed  @xcite .",
    "hence convergence for the no - wind case differs from the wind runs , and its resolved galaxy mass is higher by roughly an order of magnitude ( as indicated in table  [ tab : sims ] ) .",
    "the low - mass peak of the gsmf is shifted over by roughly the difference in mass resolution between the two models , further indicating that the gsmf here is impacted by resolution effects .",
    "hence the turn - down in the no - wind gsmf at low masses is a numerical artifact , not a prediction . for the wind models",
    ", this turn - down happens below the nominal stellar mass resolution .",
    "the no - wind case ( nw ; blue ) , where resolution - converged , shows the classic behavior that the gsmf well exceeds observations at all masses  ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "this is symptomatic of the overcooling problem  @xcite , in which there are too many baryons locked in stars at all epochs without strong feedback .",
    "we note that this occurs at _ all _ redshifts and masses back to @xmath113  ( and even farther back ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the overcooling problem is not just a late - time phenomenon and must be mitigated in the early universe .",
    "it has long been suggested that galactic outflows could suppress star formation to solve the overcooling problem .",
    "the magnitude of suppression , factors of several even at maximum galaxy formation efficiency around @xmath5 increasing to much larger factors at larger and smaller masses , indicates that outflows must eject a substantial amount of gas from galaxies and/or suppress accretion by adding energy to the surrounding igm . in star - forming galaxies ( typically @xmath114 ) , the dominant energy source is star formation , either from supernovae or young stars .",
    "this motivates all of our wind models having mass loading factors exceeding unity . for concreteness ,",
    "table  [ tab : sims ] shows as its final two columns the global mass fraction of baryons in stars at @xmath4 and ejected in winds by @xmath4 , respectively . for the momentum - conserved run ,",
    "the ratio between the two is roughly 3.5 , i.e. @xmath115 more baryons have been ejected from galaxies than have formed into stars by @xmath4 .",
    "the constant-@xmath36 models have a ratio of approximately 3.8 . that this ratio signficantly exceeds unity is a generic feature of all models that solve overcooling via an ejective feedback mechanism such as galactic outflows .",
    "the exact shape of the @xmath4 gsmf depends sensitively on outflows , albeit in a subtle way . as discussed in @xcite , it is not the overall suppression by ejection that governs the shape , but rather the effectiveness of subsequent re - accretion of ejected material , i.e. recycled wind mode accretion . as shown in @xcite , without wind recycling ,",
    "all gsmfs look fairly similar , and show a steep power law behavior with a faint - end slope comparable to that of the halo mass function . because wind material re - accretes into larger galaxies faster (  differential recycling \" ) , it boosts high - mass galaxy masses relative to low - mass ones , and therefore flattens the faint end of the stellar mass function . at sufficiently small masses ,",
    "the timescale for wind re - accretion exceeds the hubble time , at which point the mass function returns towards tracking the dark matter halo mass function as there is no differential effect from recycling . at sufficiently large masses",
    ", recycling is so fast that it effectively is like having no winds at all .",
    "this creates a three - tier behavior for the gsmf in simulations : it follows the steep dark matter mass function both above and below the mass range where differential recycling operates , and it is flatter within that mass range .",
    "all our wind models display this three - tiered behavior , though it is less evident in some cases . at high masses",
    ", they have a slope similar to that of the no - wind model . in the intermediate mass regime ,",
    "the slope is flatter or even inverted , and finally at low masses once again the gsmf is reverts to being steep .",
    "we note that all models grossly overpredict the massive end of the gsmf compared to observations .",
    "this is because we do not have any feedback mechanism to truncate star formation in massive galaxies , such as feedback from active galactic nuclei  ( agn ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence our first key point is that our current simulations can only reliably probe the regime of star - forming galaxies , which dominate at masses @xmath116  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we show that it is possible to include empirical feedback mechanisms to quench star formation in massive galaxies , without significantly affecting the population of galaxies below @xmath117 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that strong agn activity is not seen in lower - mass galaxies today  ( @xmath118 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the exact transitions between the various gsmf tiers depend strongly on wind model . in the constant-@xmath36 cases ,",
    "the three - tiered behavior is manifested as a bump in the gsmf at high masses at @xmath4 . in the constant wind case ( cw ; red )",
    ", the middle tier covers a small mass range , and differential recycling is so strong that it actually produces an inverted slope of the gsmf within that small mass range .",
    "outside that , the gsmf is quite steep , roughly following the slope of the no - wind case .",
    "the slow - wind case ( sw ; magenta ) follows a similar pattern , but the mass scale of the differential recycling is lower because wind speeds are slower , and hence wind recycling becomes effective at a smaller scale . in neither case",
    "does the gsmf resemble the observed one at @xmath4 even in the regime where quenching feedback is unimportant , although the slow - wind case is not as far off .",
    "the momentum - driven scalings case ( vzw ; green ) produces a more gradual differential recycling curve than the constant-@xmath36 cases  @xcite .",
    "hence the middle tier is not inverted , but merely shallower than the high and low mass ends of the gsmf .",
    "this mimics the behavior exhibited by the observed gsmf .",
    "recent observations by @xcite have conclusively detected an upturn to a steep faint - end slope . in detail",
    ", the vzw simulation is still mildly steeper than observed and the upturn occurs at slightly too high a mass .",
    "if our physical interpretation for the origin of the gsmf is correct , this would imply that the momentum - conserved wind model has a differential recycling curve that is close to , but not quite , correct .",
    "it is worth mentioning that modeling the dynamics of wind recycling is subject to significant numerical difficulties as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* though more so at in higher - mass halos where hot gas is present ) , so the level of discrepancy with data is probably within modeling uncertainties , but more careful simulations are needed to determine this .    the evolution of the gsmf can now be probed to high redshifts thanks to advancing deep near - ir surveys . at the massive end",
    ", the observed gsmf has a less pronounced cutoff at high-@xmath9 . since this truncation is associated with the presence of  red and dead \" galaxies , the relative dearth of such galaxies at @xmath3",
    "explains why the truncation is much less sharp . at @xmath119 ,",
    "the vzw run yields a gsmf at @xmath120 that is in fair agreement with data , although it appears somewhat too steep .",
    "meanwhile , sw overproduces the number of galaxies at these stellar masses similar to the no - wind case .",
    "the constant wind case generally matches well here , although it still shows a bump at @xmath121 that is not seen in the data .",
    "considering all redshift from @xmath7 in toto , the momentum - driven scalings model yields the best match from amongst these models to the population of star - forming galaxies at @xmath122 .",
    "the faint - end slope of the gsmf has been observed to evolve towards being steeper at high redshifts .",
    "our simulations follow this trend qualitatively , but only within the intermediate mass regime where differential recycling flattens ( or inverts ) the gsmf slope at later times . outside of this regime",
    ", the slope always approaches the faint - end halo mass slope of @xmath123 .",
    "for instance , in the vzw run , the intermediate mass regime occurs at @xmath124 , and the slope at @xmath4 is @xmath125 , which is close to the observed slope in that mass range . in the sw case , the intermediate mass regime is narrower , @xmath126 , while in the cw case it is equally narrow but occurs at a mass @xmath127 higher . in both constant-@xmath36 simulations ,",
    "the gsmf slope at @xmath4 is inverted in this regime , i.e. @xmath128 , but at higher redshifts @xmath14 increases .",
    "the general reason for the increase in @xmath14 within the intermediate mass regime is that wind recycling becomes less important at higher redshifts .",
    "this is primarily because there is less time for ejected material to return to galaxies  @xcite .",
    "our simulations , particularly the momentum - conserved case , tend to find median recycling times that are fairly constant at @xmath129  gyr , independent of cosmic epoch  @xcite ; this is partly because wind speeds at a given @xmath1 are higher  @xcite at high-@xmath9 .",
    "hence the features associated with recycling become less prominent , and in fact they are essentially invisible at @xmath3 in the vzw case .",
    "observationally , @xmath14 is seen to evolve as @xmath130  @xcite , where @xmath131 .",
    "effectively , this corresponds to the slope in the mass regime of @xmath122 , which is what can be probed in practice out to high-@xmath9 at this time ; at lower masses , the present - day gsmf becomes steeper , but this can not be reliably traced at high-@xmath9 .",
    "the momentum - driven scalings model matches well at low-@xmath9 ( below @xmath5 ) , but at high-@xmath9 the faint end is quite a bit steeper : e.g. at @xmath13 , @xmath123 in the regime where it is observed to be more like 1.5 or so . hence while the evolutionary trend is qualitatively as observed , there are quantitative discrepancies in the sense that this model has too many small galaxies ( as is the case with all models ) .",
    "this has also been noted at @xmath132 in a comparison of various simulations to mass function observations  @xcite ; all models have too steep a mass function at @xmath133 .",
    "this may indicate that feedback processes in very small systems are not being correctly represented in these models , a point that will be reiterated throughout this paper .",
    "one issue that may explain part of the difference between the simulations and data are observational uncertainties in determinations of stellar masses , which can become significant particularly at high-@xmath9 . to explore this , at @xmath106 we added a gaussian random scatter with @xmath134  dex to each galaxy s stellar mass in the momentum - conserved wind simulation  ( which is a typical observational uncertainty ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and recomputed the stellar mass function .",
    "the result is shown as the dashed cyan line in figure  [ fig : massfcn ] .",
    "because the mass function is steep , more small galaxies get scattered to larger masses than vice versa , and the mass function does becomes slightly shallower ( and in this case , agrees slightly better with observations at the massive end ) .",
    "but this does not go far towards reducing the overproduction of small galaxies in the simulations .",
    "there are , additionally , substantial systematic uncertainties in determining stellar masses from photometric data  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we have not considered such effects here , but it s conceivable that they could dominate over the statistical errors . hence",
    "while this effect should be accounted for when comparing carefully to data , it does not qualitatively alter the faint end discrepancy .",
    "overall , the momentum - driven scalings model does the best job of the models considered in reproducing the observed gsmfs around @xmath5 from @xmath0 .",
    "there are still significant discrepancies at higher and lower masses , so the agreement is only good in the range of @xmath122 .",
    "nevertheless , this is a significant success , a first for cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( that we are aware of ) .",
    "while the discrepancy at high masses is well - known and strongly suggestive of quenching feedback absent in these simulations , the discrepancy at small masses is less certain owing to still substantial observational uncertainties at high-@xmath9 .",
    "upcoming deeper observations should quantify this discrepancy to greater precision , possibly providing insights into the nature of feedback processes in high - redshift dwarf galaxies .",

    "compared to observations at @xmath4  @xcite , none of the models fare well , as they all overproduce the number of star - forming galaxies at higher sfr s .",

    "* ) . even at @xmath133 , the observed ssfr(@xmath1 ) has a negative slope  @xcite , whereas this model predicts a positive slope .",
    "we will see in paper  ii that this is also reflected in the relation between gas fraction and @xmath1 , which has a turnover to low masses that is likewise absent in observations .",
    "this could signify that wind recycling should be more effective in small systems , or perhaps less material should be ejected from these systems in the first place .",
    "just as with the faint end of the high - redshift gsmf , this highlights that even our most successful model has difficulty correctly reproducing observations of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we will return to this point in  [ sec : age ] .",

    "galaxies with high gas fractions at a given @xmath1 lie above the mean ssfr relation , and those with low gas fractions lie below .",
    "this is not surprising since the presence of gas drives star formation based on our assumed star formation law , but it provides an interesting generic prediction ( independent of outflows ) of this class of models where star formation is driven by accretion .",
    "such a trend would not be expected , for example , if mergers drove elevated sfrs at a given @xmath180 ; in that case , it is the gas configuration rather than overall gas content that drives elevated sfrs , as gas is much more concentrated in mergers owing to tidal dissipation  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in paper",

    "-3.2 in    figure  [ fig : ssfrevol ] shows the evolution from @xmath181 of the specific star formation rate at a particular stellar mass of @xmath182 in our four wind models .",
    "this mass is chosen because observations can directly measure ssfr at this mass at all epochs ( with small extrapolations ) , and it is well - resolved by simulations but is expected to be negligibly affected by quenching feedback . in the simulations , this ssfr is computed as the median ssfr within a stellar mass bin of @xmath1830.25  dex around @xmath184 .",
    "most models show a characteristic evolution of the ssfr which is essentially a power law in @xmath185 .",
    "the fundamental physics giving rise to this is gas inflow driven by growth of structure . in the cold accretion paradigm that captures the basic behavior in hydrodynamic simulations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amount of gas inflowing into the star forming region is correlated with the gas inflowing at the halo virial radius , since cold streams efficiently channel material to the center of the halo  @xcite .",
    "feedback processes that strongly impact the surrounding gas to retard infall can cause significant deviations from this  @xcite , but let us set that aside for now to examine the implications of this simplest scenario . the amount of gas entering the virial radius can be estimated by the total mass accretion rate times the baryon fraction .",
    "the total mass accretion rate onto halos has been well measured in simulations  @xcite , and scales with redshift as @xmath186 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath186 is indicated by the dotted line , arbitrarily normalised to the observed @xmath4 ssfr .",
    "the no - wind and slow - wind cases follow this power law essentially at all redshifts .",
    "the no - wind case is easy to understand , since there is no additional physics regulating star formation beyond accretion .",
    "the slow - wind case also follows this because it simply ejects a constant two - thirds of the accreted material .",
    "hence the sfr reduction translates into a similar reduction in @xmath1 , so the ssfr evolution is nearly identical to the no - wind case . in the sw case ,",
    "two additional processes are at work : feedback heats surrounding gas to retard accretion into the ism , which is countered by additional accretion provided by recycled winds .",
    "note that at this stellar mass , about half the @xmath4 accretion is recycled winds  @xcite , and both recycling and heating increase to low redshifts .",
    "the impact of these processes does not appear to be large ( barring a remarkable cancellation ) , as the net effect is only a slight increase in ssfr in the sw model over the no - wind case .",
    "the constant wind case shows a substantial departure from no - winds , with ssfr lower by @xmath187 , increasing at late times .",
    "as discussed previously , this model produces significant heating of surrounding gas , substantially retarding inflow into the ism from the virial radius  @xcite . this effect becomes stronger at low-@xmath9 as feedback energy accumulates in the igm , as evidenced e.g. by a much higher fraction of cosmic gas in the warm - hot intergalactic medium in this model  @xcite . at @xmath182 ,",
    "recycling is rare in this wind model  @xcite , so the net effect is to strongly lower the ssfr relative to the no winds case .",
    "in contrast , the momentum - driven wind scalings model increases the ssfr relative to no winds . in this case , the relationship to no - winds is not so straightforward to understand , because the mass loading factor depends on galaxy mass and epoch .",
    "overall , the amount of energy input in vzw is smaller than in cw .",
    "recyling is dominant at late times at @xmath188 , but at early epochs it is not infrequent .",
    "the net effect is larger suppressions of the ssfr at early epochs , while at late times the wind recycling at this mass causes the ssfr to be higher relative to a simple inflow model extrapolated from high-@xmath9 .",
    "hence the vzw model yields a shallower evolution of ssfr(@xmath9 ) because it suppresses star formation at early epochs and later recycles that material into galaxies .",
    "observations show a very rapid rise from @xmath189 , and then essentially no evolution out to very high redshifts  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this is difficult to reproduce in a simple accretion - driven scenario , and they argued for a rather radical modification to the galaxy formation paradigm in which no stars formed in halos with virial masses less than @xmath190 ( as well as above @xmath191 ) .",
    "this strongly suppresses early star formation until the characteristic mass of star - forming halos exceeds this threshold mass , at which point it reverts to the accretion - driven scaling .",
    "clearly this hypothesis is incorrect today ; there is no evident feature in the galaxy population around halo masses of @xmath192 , unlike at @xmath193 where many transitions occur .",
    "it is also difficult to accomodate at high-@xmath9 , as smaller halos need to form stars to reionise the universe and form observed high-@xmath9 galaxy populations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , while implausible , this scenario correctly emphasizes that some process must suppress high - redshift star formation significantly in order to match current ssfr evolution observations .",
    "the observations are themselves uncertain to some extent , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "for instance , the original @xmath157 data point ( black circle ) was taken from dust - corrected uv - derived star formation rates of star - forming bzk galaxies  @xcite .",
    "recent _ herschel _ data characterizing the infrared continuum of such sources suggests that the extinction corrections were overestimated by up to @xmath172  @xcite ; this modification is shown by the red arrow and circle in figure  [ fig : ssfrevol ] . prior to this correction",
    ", the data exceeded the accretion rate evolution , making it difficult to reconcile this evolution within the cold accretion paradigm .",
    "this prompted @xcite to make the radical suggestion that the imf may evolve with redshift , so that the true sfr s were lower by @xmath194 . if the _ herschel_-derived correction is right , the @xmath157 data point is now consistent with being powered by ongoing accretion , making it viable within the cold accretion paradigm .",
    "@xcite pointed out that there still may be a problem with respect to the momentum - driven scalings model ; this may be particularly true if the corrections at these masses ( which are not directly constrained by _ herschel _ data ) are less than a factor of two  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "but this is no longer a fundamental difficulty , and this level of discrepancy could in principle be alleviated by modifications of the feedback prescription .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that doing high - resolution disk simulations using a momentum - conserved feedback model with somewhat different parameters results in galaxies that are in very good agreement with ( corrected ) ssfr data at @xmath195 .",
    "the slope @xmath196 of the main sequence ( defined by sfr@xmath197 ) is also observed to evolve downwards from being unity at high-@xmath9  @xcite , to @xmath198 at @xmath199  @xcite , to @xmath200 at @xmath201  @xcite down to @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "there is some sensitivity to selection effects , particularly in how one chooses a sample of star - forming galaxies at the massive end ; the preponderance of low - ssfr massive galaxies particularly at low-@xmath9 pulls the slope down depending on how many such systems are included in the fit .",
    "hence it is not straightforward to compare to our models where we do not reproduce large passive galaxies . in general , our momentum - conserved winds case produces slopes of @xmath202 , roughly independently of redshift , and the no - wind case produces a shallower slope . for the constant-@xmath36 models @xmath196",
    "is ill - defined as they show a strong three - tiered behavior .",
    "the trend of the slope becoming more shallow with time is therefore not obviously evident even in our favored model .",
    "while this may be a consequence of the lack of quenching feedback in massive galaxies , we note that the semi - analytic model of @xcite includes agn feedback but still produces a slope around unity for the present - day main sequence .    in summary , the evolution of the specific star formation rate encodes information about the feedback processes that have regulated star formation up to that epoch .",
    "hence this is a critical quantity to measure with upcoming surveys .",
    "the fundamental driver is the gas accretion rate onto halos , which evolves as @xmath186 , but feedback can modify this by either retarding accretion onto the galaxy or adding recycled wind accretion . matching observations that suggest a significant departure from this scaling at @xmath3",
    "requires suppressing star formation at early epochs . of the feedback models examined here , only the momentum - conserved scalings case works in this sense , though it is still well away from the unevolving ssfr seen from @xmath132 .",
    "observations at these epochs remain fairly uncertain  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we await more robust constraints from upcoming surveys .",
    "the equilibrium paradigm for galaxy evolution introduced earlier is appropriate for central galaxies , because cold accretion channels material to the centers of halos .",
    "satellite galaxies , in contrast , must scavenge their fuel from ambient halo gas , and therefore can be impacted by a range of processes related to their surrounding environment . satellite galaxies could thus display a broadly different class of properties than central galaxies , for which environment is not a major driver except through wind recycling . here",
    "we investigate the properties of satellite vs. central galaxies in our simulations , contrasting the statistics we have examined earlier between the satellite and central galaxy populations .",

    "satellite galaxy mass functions are , for the most part , simply scaled - down versions of the central galaxy mass functions .",
    "they display the same features arising from differential wind recycling .",
    "in general , the properties of satellites appear to be established when they are central galaxies in their own halo , and are not dramatically affected by falling into a larger halo .",
    "this is broadly consistent with trends inferred from halo occupation distribution models of galaxy clustering within dark matter halos  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for all models at @xmath4 , central galaxies dominate by number at all resolved masses .",
    "this may be surprising , as it is often assumed that most small galaxies are satellites , and that the fraction of satellites increases strongly to small masses .",
    "the no - wind model does show an increase in satellite fraction to lower masses , but only mildly so .",
    "in contrast , the wind models show a satellite fraction that is approximately constant at one - third of all galaxies for @xmath114 . for @xmath203",
    "the satellite fraction decreases , although it is high again at very large masses  these are satellites in galaxy groups where the halo occupation distribution is steeply rising  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* see their figure  8) based on the conditional luminosity function constrained by the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and recent sams also yield similar trends  @xcite . at @xmath13 , there are even fewer satellite galaxies at a given stellar mass , typically only around 20% of all galaxies for @xmath204 .",
    "hence dwarf galaxies are not typically satellites , but rather central galaxies in small halos .",
    "the relatively constant ( and low ) satellite fraction has a significant implication for galaxy formation .",
    "it means that that whatever physics is responsible for establishing the mass function and other such ensemble - averaged observables must predominantly govern central galaxies , not satellites  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is not possible , for instance , to alter satellite galaxy physics to reconcile the steep faint - end gsmf slope in the constant-@xmath36 or no - wind simulations with observations .",
    "this is even more true at higher redshifts .",

    "@xcite showed that the timescale for star formation in most galaxies is reasonably well approximated by the hubble time less 1  gyr , since none but the largest galaxies ( today ) form stars in the first gyr .",

    "all models show a negative slope in birthrates with @xmath1 , indicative of archaeological downsizing . at small masses",

    "overall , however , star - forming galaxies show generically smooth and fairly constant sfhs over much of cosmic time to @xmath107  @xcite , similar to that inferred for the milky way .",
    "there are a significant number of galaxies with no ongoing star formation ( i.e.  quenched \" ) , predominantly at low masses .",
    "the smaller panels show the fraction of quenched central ( magenta ) and satellite ( cyan ) galaxies as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "there are a few small central galaxies with zero instantaneous sfr s .",
    "it is not clear what these are ; one possibility is that they are actually quenched satellites whose orbits carry them outside the virial radius calculated by our spherical overdensity halo finder , and therefore are identified as centrals .",
    "another possibility is that quenching is partly numerical , since this may impact a satellite galaxy s ability to cool gas from a hot halo .",
    "since they are very few in number , we will leave a detailed investigation of these possibilities for the future .",
    "the satellite quenched fractions become large towards small masses .",
    "below a few@xmath205 , the median ssfr drops to zero for satellites in all models . even above this mass , satellites show lower typical ssfr s than central galaxies , hence environmental processes can affect even large satellite galaxies .",
    "the different wind models ( including no winds ) show only minor differences in terms of quenched satellite fraction , despite significant differences in ssfr .",
    "this indicates that it is not outflows that are responsible for quenching satellites , and instead is some process(es ) related to environment that depends more on the growth of structure common to all models .",
    "possible environmental processes that quench satellites are ram pressure stripping , tidal harrassment , and strangulation ( i.e. cutting off of the gas supply ) .",
    "@xcite showed that , in sph simulations similar to ours , quenching of a galaxy occurs on a @xmath206  gyr timescale after entering another galaxy s halo .",
    "the process is gradual because subhalos retain their identity for quite some time after entering a larger halo , so the satellite does not immediately see the full effect of the hot gas in the larger halo . in the cold accretion paradigm",
    ", the gas cooling along filaments tends to fall to the center of the halo , and hence galaxies that turn into satellites become disconnected from their feeding filaments . but strangulation can not be the entire story , because the gas consumption timescales for these systems are of order a few gyr ( as we will show in paper  ii ) , whereas quenching occurs on a timescale of @xmath207  gyr . hence harrassment and stripping must be playing a role .",
    "unfortunately , while the exact processes that drive satellite quenching are interesting , they are a great numerical challenge to model properly  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the numerical resolution and methodology used here is probably insufficient to make robust quantitative statements .    although there are seen to be a significant number of dwarf galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation , sdss data  @xcite actually indicate a trend opposite to that predicted here , namely a smaller fraction of red satellites ( and centrals ) at smaller masses",
    ". one difference may be that these analyses defined red based on a color cut between the red sequence and blue cloud , which does not straightforwardly correspond to being fully quenched or not ; the observed galaxies may simply have lower specific sfrs . interestingly , a recent semi - analytic model that is more successful than our simulations at matching a wider range of data still suffers from the same discrepancy , showing an upturn in red fraction at low masses  @xcite .",
    "hence the qualitative discrepancy may hint at generic difficulties in modeling environmental effects in satellites within hierarchical models , and bears further investigation .    in summary ,",
    "the fraction of satellite galaxies in our wind models is roughly constant with mass for @xmath114 at around 20 - 30% , declining slightly with redshift .",
    "their mass functions show trends similar to centrals , likely reflecting the fact that these trends are set when satellites were centrals .",
    "satellites are increasingly quenched to smaller masses , reflecting environmental processes that gradually disconnect these galaxies from their feeding cold streams .",
    "high - mass quenching must arise from another source that is currently not included such as agn feedback , but low - mass quenching can be understood as a result of environmental effects that are already included ( at least in principle ) in these types of models .",
    "-0.2 in    -0.5 in    we have seen that below masses of @xmath208 , the wind models show a turn - down in ssfr and birthrate ( and in paper ii we will see a similar turn - down in gas fraction ) , for both satellites and centrals .",
    "this is in contradiction with observations that show no such turn - down .    to investigate this further",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig : agesat ] the mean ( mass - weighted ) stellar ages of galaxies as a function of @xmath1 , for satellites ( red ) and centrals ( blue ) , in our four wind models at @xmath4 .",

    "running medians are shown for centrals ( magenta ) and satellites ( cyan ) .",
    "all models exhibit archaeological downsizing for galaxies at the massive end .",
    "but for the wind models , below some mass the trend reverses , and smaller galaxies begin to be progressively older .",
    "this is opposite to the trend observed by @xcite in a group catalog derived from sdss ( see their figure  4 ) . for the vzw and sw models",
    ", this happens at @xmath209 ; above this mass , the ages are in reasonable agreement with data .",
    "they also show that satellites are slightly older than centrals at a given mass , which is also qualitatively as observed , although @xcite find the median mass - weighted age difference at @xmath210 is @xmath211  gyr ( becoming smaller to higher masses ) while our wind models predict a smaller difference .",
    "the no - wind case shows an archaeological downsizing trend at all masses .",
    "the mass where the turn - down happens is exactly the mass where the specific star formation rate turns over ( figure  [ fig : ssfrsat ] ) .",
    "we argued previously that this owes to wind recycling , in particular the lack of it in the smallest systems .",
    "hence we begin to build a consistent story for the failure of wind models in the dwarf galaxy regime : the smallest galaxies in these models begin forming stars early , and owing to ejection of mass they lose their gas and can not reacquire it as fast as larger galaxies .",
    "this is not because small galaxies are satellites : central galaxies show exactly the same trend , and most small galaxies are centrals anyway .",
    "one possibility is that the simulations do not resolve the ( supposedly ) bursty star formation histories of dwarf galaxies , which could give rise to younger ages .",
    "it is true that our simulations lack the resolution to model internal resonances that can drive gas towards the center of galaxies during interactions , fueling a burst  @xcite .",
    "however , recent data has strongly questioned whether bursts are common in dwarfs .",
    "@xcite used the volume - limited 11hugs sample to show that the burst fraction , defined as having birthrate@xmath212 , is only @xmath213 in dwarfs ( typically @xmath214 ) , comprising @xmath215 of that population s star formation .",
    "these numbers are similar to what is seen for more massive galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in the small panels in figure  [ fig : agesat ] we show the burst ( @xmath216 ) fraction as a function of mass , for centrals ( magenta ) and satellites ( cyan ) .",
    "it is generally quite low , and in our favored vzw model it is mostly independent of mass at @xmath217 for @xmath118 , in both satellites and centrals . in the no wind case ,",
    "the burst fraction rises dramatically at small masses , but mostly in central galaxies not satellites .",
    "the three - tiered shapes of the birthrate curves in the cw and sw model result in odd behaviors in the burst fraction , and result in very low burst fractions for small systems .",
    "the favoured momentum - conserved wind case agrees well with observations of burst fractions , although the fraction of star formation in bursts is @xmath218% which is @xmath219 below that observed .",
    "this model s concordance with data suggests that , contrary to popular wisdom , small dwarfs are not significantly burstier compared to larger star - forming systems .",
    "the higher ages , steep high-@xmath9 gsmf , and lower ssfr s for dwarfs suggest that wind models should suppress early star formation in smaller systems even more than is currently done in the momentum - conserved wind case , and produce a larger reservoir of gas for consumption at later epochs .",
    "this could arise if mass loading factors are larger at early epochs than assumed here , and/or wind speeds are reduced at late times such that these galaxies can reacquire their ejected gas .",
    "this could also arise if the star formation law is different in these systems owing to a less efficient conversion of atomic gas into molecular  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  this would tend to delay star formation , providing a younger , more vigorously star - forming dwarf population today .",
    "investigating this discrepancy further is likely to reveal new physical processes that are important for the evolution of small galaxies at all cosmic epochs .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations are now reaching a maturity level such that they can be informatively compared to observations of galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "this is a new era in this type of modeling , as past such efforts have generally produced quite poor agreement with data , and have been severely limited by dynamic range particularly when evolved to low redshifts . with improvement in both computing power and input physics , simulations can now plausibly reproduce a wider suite of observed relations ( though still far from all ) , which in return can yield insights into the governing physics .",
    "a particularly important new physical aspect has been the incoporation of galactic outflows , originally motivated to explain igm enrichment , and simultaneously having a wide - ranging impact on galaxies stellar , gas , and metal content .",
    "in this paper we present a study of how the stellar content and star formation rates of galaxies are impacted by galactic outflows .",
    "we concentrate on understanding the underlying physical drivers of these properties , and how observations can enlighten us on the way in which these drivers operate in the real universe . to this end",
    "we present some comparisons with observations , showing that including outflows with momentum - conserved scalings provide the best overall match to the ensemble of observations considered in this work , although notable discrepancies remain . given the broader success of this class of models in matching igm ( and other galaxy ) properties , and that these scalings are consistent with those observed for outflows , this adds to the growing body of evidence that strong and ubiquitous outflows with these scalings are an important piece in understanding the overall evolution of galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the stellar component can be broadly understood within the context of a cycle of gas inflow and outflow between galaxies and the igm .",
    "this differs somewhat from the traditional view of galaxy formation in which halos and their mergers drive galaxy evolution .",
    "the cycle of baryons can at its most basic level be analytically represented by a slowly - evolving equilibrium between inflow , outflow , and star formation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : equil ] ) , where the outflows govern how much of the inflowing material turns into stars .",
    "the galaxy mass dependence of the outflow rate thus directly governs e.g. the gsmf , the specific star formation rate of galaxies , and galaxy ages .",
    "a particularly key aspect is the idea of differential wind recycling , in which material ejected returns to galaxies in a mass - dependent manner .",
    "this drives noticeable features in observable properties of galaxies as a function of mass , providing a way to constrain how outflows move material within the cosmic ecosystem surrounding galaxies .",
    "we reiterate that this scenario does not invoke the halo virial radius , environment , or mergers as playing a governing role in star - forming galaxy evolution .",
    "the cold streams feeding star - forming galaxies generally take no notice of the virial radius , are broadly unaffected by environment , and while such streams also carry in galaxies that merge , the mass growth rate in such mergers is sub - dominant  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the virial radius , environment , and mergers seem to play a pivotal role in quenching star formation , and more generally in the evolution of massive halos hosting quiescent galaxies .    with that framework in mind , we summarize the key conclusions of this paper :    * galactic outflows are required to suppress stellar mass growth at all epochs .",
    "the stellar mass function is quite steep and nearly a power law at high redshifts . at lower redshifts it develops a more pronounced three - tier behavior , where the middle tier reflects the steepness of differential ( i.e. mass - dependent ) wind recycling  @xcite , and the higher and lower tiers tend towards the slope of the halo mass function .",
    "the middle tier ( typically just below @xmath5 ) becomes shallower with time owing primarily to wind recycling , which returns ejected material faster to more massive galaxies .",

    "the star formation rate functions show many of the same general features as the gsmf , but the detailed evolution , mass dependence , and dependence on outflows are somewhat different .",
    "comparisons of these models to present - day data are hampered by their lack of quenching feedback in massive galaxies in our models . at @xmath221 where massive quenched galaxies are less common",
    ", momentum - conserved winds produces a good match to the observed star formation rate function derived from h@xmath14 data . * the specific star formation rate s dependence on mass",
    "is governed by how the effective mass loading factor of outflows varies with stellar mass .",
    "the no - wind case shows too little star formation at a given @xmath1 , despite having far too much star formation globally .",
    "the momentum - conserved wind model matches observations well at @xmath222 , but all wind models show too little star formation at the smallest masses .",
    "this may indicate that there should be less mass loading or more wind recycling at the @xmath223 compared to what is currently in these models , or else the conversion of gas into stars is not being modeled properly in low - mass systems . *",
    "the evolution of the ssfr is generally well - described as being driven by cosmic mass accretion into halos , which scales as @xmath186 .",
    "the no - wind and slow - wind cases follow this trend at all redshifts .",
    "observations do so at @xmath6 , but at @xmath3 they depart from this scaling , indicating that small high - redshift galaxies must be significantly suppressed .",
    "the momentum - conserved wind model qualitatively yields this , but not enough to match current high-@xmath9 observations . pinning down",
    "the ssfr evolution at @xmath3 will have a major impact on understanding early galaxy evolution and feedback processes .",

    "the satellites gsmf follows the same trends as that of centrals .",
    "however , there are many more non - star forming satellites than centrals , particularly at lower masses , owing to environmental effects wherein the satellites no longer effectively receive inflow from the igm ; this trend may be contrary to that observed .",

    "the advantages of invoking this particular mechanism are that ( i ) outflows are observed and seem to follow scalings that yield many desirable properties in models ; ( ii ) they concurrently enrich the igm at all cosmic epochs as observed ; ( iii ) they lower the baryon content of halos preferentially to lower masses as observed  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( iv ) they are an ejective feedback mechanism that works in conjunction with the cold accretion paradigm , in which it is difficult to prevent filaments from channeling gas efficiently into galaxies .",
    "there are other ideas to suppress low - mass star formation by regulating it as a function of mass internally within the ism ( i.e. by varying the star formation efficiency as a function of @xmath1 ) , or by preventing material entering the halo from accreting into small galaxies .",
    "but these scenarios must explain igm enrichment separately , and must hide most of the gravitationally - accreted baryons in halos in some undetected form which is becoming increasingly difficult to accomodate  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while attractive , the idea of invoking outflows is not without its difficulties .",
    "for instance , the amount of mass being driven out of these galaxies is large , globally many times the amount of mass forming into stars .",
    "this is a generic result , because some process must suppress stellar masses by such large factors at the low mass end  @xcite ; in our models , this process is galactic outflows , as opposed to ism physics or preventive feedback .",
    "the physical mechanism(s ) that would drive such a sizeable amount of material out of galaxies is unclear .",
    "the canonical idea of driving outflows from overpressurized bubbles in the ism tends to ( when modeled ) create holes by which energy and metals , but little mass , are ejected  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there are difficulties with entraining cold clouds as observed without disrupting them .",
    "the scalings preferred by our current comparisons to data are those expected for radiation - driven winds , but it is not well known how far out the photons momentum can drive dust , and how far out the dust remains coupled to the gas . for instance , @xcite use spectropolarimetry to determine that the dust in m82 is moving outwards much more slowly than the gas , suggesting that the gas and dust are not strongly coupled . furthermore , the momentum budget of typical stellar populations is , under the assumption of single photon scattering , insufficent to drive outflows as appear to be necessary , indicating that supernovae or other sources of energy are still required . without a solid understanding of the dynamics driving outflows , simulations such as the ones presented here can not be considered a complete description of the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "fortunately , observations of outflows across cosmic time are gaining substantial traction  @xcite , providing empirical constraints for models while the theory of outflow propagation develops .",
    "our momentum - conserved winds provides the best match to data on star - forming galaxies of the four models considered here .",
    "but the agreement is only good in the rather narrow mass range from @xmath225 . at larger masses ,",
    "the current models require some additional quenching mechanism perhaps associated with agn  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at smaller masses",
    ", this model produces too vigorous early star formation in dwarfs , resulting in too - old stellar populations , too steep mass functions , and insufficient star formation today  ( a result also seen in many sams , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may indicate that feedback in these dwarf systems evolves in some way not captured by this particular outflow prescription , or else that there is some additional physical process that is important .",
    "it is possible that the star formation law is different in smaller systems to make gas consumption less efficient  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or else that these simulations have too low a density threshold for star formation ( owing to resolution limitations ) such that they do not properly represent star formation in low surface brightness , gas - rich systems  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . more broadly",
    ", none of our simulations can simultaneously reproduce the shallow stellar mass function , archaeological downsizing , and star formation rate downsizing as observed ; this remains a fundamental challenge for galaxy formation models .",
    "even though the concordant mass range of the momentum - conserved wind model is fairly narrow , it is still a significant step forward as it provides physical insights into the processes that govern galaxy evolution at all masses , pinpointing both successes and failures .",
    "and it is worth recognizing that this particular dex in stellar mass happens to be where most of cosmic star formation occurs , so it is a critical mass range for understanding global stellar mass growth .",
    "overall , the general simulation - inspired framework for how inflows and outflows govern galaxy formation is compelling from both an observational and theoretical perspective , and is well - situated within the current hierarchical structure formation paradigm .",
    "this makes it an attractive scenario to pursue both analytically and numerically . in paper",
    "ii we will examine how this framework provides intuition about the gaseous and metal content of galaxies , thereby together covering the primary constituents that determine the observable multi - wavelength properties of galaxies at all cosmic epochs .",
