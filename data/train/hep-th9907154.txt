    "the barrett - crane relativistic model @xcite is an intriguing proposal for addressing the problem of constructing a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the model is related to the covariant , or spin - foam , formulation @xcite of loop quantum gravity @xcite , and has recently received much attention .",
    "barrett and crane have defined this model as a state sum defined over a fixed triangulation @xmath1 of 4d spacetime . here , we show that the @xmath2 limit of the barrett - crane model can be derived from the feynman expansion of a field theory over four copies of the homogeneous space @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , the barrett - crane model is defined as a sum over colorings @xmath4 ( assignments of spins to faces ) of the triangulation @xmath1",
    "@xmath5 = \\sum_{c } a_{bc}(\\delta , c ) , \\label{c1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the barrett - crane amplitude of the colored triangulation @xmath7 . in the feynman expansion @xmath8 } = \\sum_{\\gamma }   { \\lambda^{v[\\gamma]}\\over { \\rm sym}[\\gamma ] } \\ \\ z[\\gamma ] \\label{field}\\ ] ] of the field theory we consider , the feynman graphs @xmath9 turn out to have the structure of a 2-complex . here",
    "$ ] is the action , which depends on a coupling constant @xmath11 , while @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] are the number of vertices and the order of symmetries of @xmath9 .",
    "every triangulation @xmath1 determines a 2-complex @xmath14 : the 2-skeleton of its dual cellular complex .",
    "we show in this paper that the barrett - crane model over the triangulation @xmath1 is precisely the amplitude of the feynman graph @xmath15 : @xmath5 = z[\\gamma(\\delta)].\\ ] ] more remarkably , the single terms of the sum ( [ c1 ] ) match .",
    "in fact , first of all , the space over which our field theory is defined is compact and the feynman integrals are replaced by feynman sums @xmath16= \\sum_{c } \\ \\",
    "a(\\gamma , c ) .",
    "\\label{c}\\ ] ] next , we show that the discrete `` momenta '' @xmath4 in ( [ c ] ) correspond precisely to the colorings @xmath4 of the triangulation in ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "that is , they are spins attached to ( the 2-cells of the 2-complex @xmath15 which are dual to ) the faces of @xmath1 . and , finally , we show that the barrett - crane amplitude is precisely equal to the feynman amplitude of the corresponding `` colored '' 2-complex @xmath17 @xmath18    the feynman expansion of field theory we consider generates many more terms than a barrett - crane model over a fixed triangulation .",
    "the additional summation is precisely what we need in order to address the main difficulty in developing a physical theory of quantum gravity starting from the barrett - crane model ( or from spin foam models in general @xcite ) . in these models , indeed , the choice of a fixed triangulation breaks the full covariance of the theory and unphysically restricts the number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore some sort of `` sum over all triangulations '' is needed on physical grounds .",
    "the difficulty is to choose a precise characterization of the objects over which to sum , and to fix the relative weights .",
    "this is precisely done by the full feynman expansion of our field theory .",
    "therefore , the field theory provides a precise implementation of the loose idea of `` summing over triangulations '' . in detail , one first notices that the barrett - crane amplitude @xmath6 does not depend on the full ( combinatorial ) information contained in the triangulation @xmath1 , but only on a subset of this .",
    "in fact , it depends only on the 2-complex @xmath15 , its dual 2-skeleton .",
    "thus , the barrett - crane state sum ( [ c1 ] ) is actually a sum over all colorings of a fixed 2-complex .",
    "the expansion ( [ field ] ) extends the barrett - crane state sum ( [ c1 ] ) to a sum over colored 2-complexes , and fixes the relative weight of these .",
    "thus , what emerges in the feynman expansion is not a sum over actual _",
    "triangulations _ , as one might have naively expected , but rather a sum over certain different objects : colored 2-complexes @xmath19 @xmath20    now , colored 2-complexes @xmath21 are precisely _ spin foams_. spin foams were derived ( under the name branched colored surfaces ) in describing the dynamics of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "indeed , the covariant formulation of loop quantum gravity yields a partition function which is precisely a sum over spin foams of the form ( [ sf ] ) .",
    "intuitively , a spin foam describes the time evolution of the spin networks , the states of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the idea that quantum spacetime could be described in terms of objects of this kind has been proposed earlier , in particular by baez @xcite and reisenberger @xcite ( see also iwasaki @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "baez has defined and analyzed the general notion of _ spin foam model _ ( and has introduced the term `` spin foam '' ) ; we refer to baez papers @xcite and @xcite for an introduction and a discussion of these models .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the idea of obtaining a `` sum over triangulations '' from a feynman expansion was successfully implemented some time ago , in the context of the matrix models of 2d dimensional quantum gravity , or `` zero dimensional string theory''@xcite . in that context ,",
    "one views a triangulated spacetime as a term in a feynman expansion of the matrix model . here , we essentially show that the same strategy works in 4d : the terms in the barrett - crane state sum can be loosely interpreted as a `` quantized spacetime geometry '' , and we show here that these `` spacetime geometries '' are generated as feynman graphs , as in the 2d quantum gravity models .",
    "the convergence with the 2d matrix models is not accidental , since matrix models are at the root of one of the lines of development that lead to the barrett - crane theory .",
    "indeed , an extension of the matrix models to 3d was obtained by boulatov in @xcite .",
    "boulatov showed that the feynman expansion of a certain field theory over three copies of @xmath22 generates triangulations , colorings and amplitudes of the ponzano - regge formulation of 3d quantum gravity @xcite ( and , taking the @xmath23 deformation of @xmath24 , the amplitudes of the turaev - viro model @xcite ) .",
    "ooguri has extended the boulatov construction to 4d in @xcite .",
    "the ooguri theory is a field theory over 4 copies of @xmath22 .",
    "its feynman expansion determines a state sum for a triangulated 4d spacetime , in which the sum is over the irreducible representations of @xmath22 .",
    "replacing @xmath22 with the quantum group @xmath25 ( @xmath23 root of 1 ) , yields a finite and well defined sum , the ooguri - crane - yetter model @xcite , which was shown by crane , kauffman and yetter @xcite to be triangulation independent , and therefore to be an invariant of the 4-manifold .",
    "the ooguri - crane - yetter invariant can be shown to be the partition function of bf theory @xcite .",
    "as euclidean general relativity can be seen as an @xmath26 bf theory with an added constraint , see e.g.   @xcite , it was then natural to search for a model of quantum euclidean general relativity as a modification of the @xmath27 ooguri - crane - yetter state sum model",
    ". the constraint that reduces bf theory to general relativity has an appealing geometrical interpretation .",
    "barrett and crane realized that this constraint can be implemented within an @xmath27 crane - yetter state sum model by ( appropriately ) restricting the sum to simple representations only .",
    "are labeled by two half integers ( two spins ) @xmath28 .",
    "a representation is simple if @xmath29 .",
    "thus , simple representations are labeled by just one spin @xmath30 . here ,",
    "following group - theory literature conventions , we use the `` color '' @xmath31 , instead of the spin @xmath30 , for labeling the simple representation . ]",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "results in @xcite support the idea that the barrett - crane model is indeed related to quantum general relativity .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that harmonic analysis on the homogeneous space @xmath32 yields precisely the simple representations of @xmath27 @xcite . it was then tempting to conjecture that by suitably restricting the 4d boulatov - ooguri field theory to this homogeneous space one could get ( the @xmath2 limit of ) the barrett - crane model . here",
    "we show that this is indeed the case , with an additional bonus : while for the ponzano - regge and for the ooguri - crane - yetter models the field theory generates a redundant sum over terms all equal to each other by triangulation independence , in the barrett - crane case the additional summation cures the breaking of covariance introduced with the choice of a triangulation , as we have discussed above .",
    "this , in a certain sense , closes a circle , bringing the recent developments back to the original matrix model idea that spacetime can be viewed as a feynman graph of a quantum theory .",
    "the interpretation vividly emphasizes the background independence of these formulations of quantum gravity .",
    "finally , the formalism we develop , naturally suggest another model , different from barrett - crane one .",
    "indeed , in the field theory we consider , @xmath27 invariance can be imposed in two ways : by the left or the right action of @xmath27 on @xmath33 .",
    "these turn out to be inequivalent . the second alternative ( case b , below )",
    "yields the barrett - crane model ( first version ) .",
    "the first alternative ( case a , below ) , is far more natural from the group theoretical point of view .",
    "it yields a different model , somewhat closer to , but distinct from the second version of the barrett - crane model .",
    "we argue in the conclusion that this other model has interesting properties .",
    "in particular , it represents another solution to the problem of quantizing the constraints that transform bf theory into general relativity .    in section",
    "[ sec : def ] we define our field theory , and state our main results in detail . in section [ sec : mode ] we find the mode expansion of the field .",
    "section [ sec : feyn ] studies the feynman expansion for the two theories . in section [ sec : triang ] we discuss the relation between the graphs generated by the feynman expansion and the triangulations .",
    "we also discuss some further variants of the model , in which orientation is taken into account . in section [ sec : disc ] we conclude with some general comments . in the two appendices , we recall some elements of @xmath34 representation theory .",
    "we consider the group @xmath35 and we fix an @xmath36 subgroup @xmath37 of @xmath38 . in particular , we may consider @xmath27 in its fundamental representation and choose a vector @xmath39 in the representation space ; we then let @xmath37 be the @xmath40 subgroup which leaves @xmath39 invariant .",
    "right multiplication by an element of @xmath37 defines an equivalence relation in @xmath38 : @xmath41 if there is @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "the space of the equivalence classes , @xmath33 , is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere @xmath44 .",
    "we denote the elements of @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "note that the invariant normalized measures @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 on @xmath44 , @xmath40 and @xmath27 respectively are related as @xmath49 .",
    "we consider a real field @xmath50 over the cartesian product of four copies of @xmath35 .",
    "we take @xmath51 square integrable with respect to each argument .",
    "we require that @xmath51 is constant along the equivalence classes .",
    "@xmath52 so that @xmath51 is in fact a function over the homogeneous space @xmath53 , which we can write as @xmath54",
    ". we will employ both notations .",
    "we require @xmath51 to be invariant under any permutation @xmath55 of its four arguments @xmath56 ( in section [ sec : triang ] , we will consider alternative symmetry requirements as well . ) finally , we project @xmath51 on its @xmath57 invariant part .",
    "this can be done in two ways .    * * case a. * the natural action of @xmath27 on the right coset @xmath58 is the left action of the group .",
    "thus we define @xmath59 * * case b. * alternatively , we define @xmath60    the two different invariance properties , ( [ casea ] ) and ( [ caseb ] ) define two different theories . in both cases ,",

    "that is , if we represent each of the five fields in the product as a node with 4 legs one for each @xmath62 and connect pair of legs corresponding to the same argument , we obtain ( the one - skeleton of ) a 4-simplex , see fig . [",

    "this completes the definition of our field theory .    in the following sections , we show that the feynman expansion ( [ field ] ) of this field theory is a sum over spin foams @xmath21 as in ( [ sf ] ) .",

    "since this characterization introduces an interesting technology , we mention it here , adapted from @xcite .",
    "+ as we have seen , a 2-complex corresponds to a 4-strand graph . consider a sequence of edges forming a closed loop in the graph , starting with an edge @xmath66 .",
    "label the strands of @xmath66 , say with integers ( 1,2,3 in 3d , and 1,2,3,4 in 4d ) .",
    "the labeling can be carried over to the next edge in the loop , say @xmath172 by noticing that the strands of @xmath172 are naturally paired with the strands of @xmath66 : a strand in @xmath66 and a strand in @xmath172 are paired either if they are the same strand that continues across the vertex , or if they both continue across the vertex into an edge @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the labeling can be carried over the loop . in closing the loop",
    ", we obtain a new labeling of the strands of @xmath66 .",

    "+ in 3d we have the following result @xcite . if , and only if , each cycle ( a loop that bounds a face ) of the 2-complex is even , we can `` thicken '' faces , edges and vertices of the 2-complex , obtaining a 3 manifold with boundaries , whose spine is the 2-complex . if , in addition , each component of the boundary of this manifold is a sphere , we can then fill the sphere with a ball , and obtain a triangulated manifold , whose dual 2-skeleton is the 2-complex .",
    "we are not aware of related results in 4d .",
    "* next , let us now consider the notion of orientation .",
    "the notion of orientability of a manifold can be extended to abstract , @xmath174-dimensional triangulations . in @xmath175 dimensions , an @xmath176-simplex @xmath177 has @xmath178 points ( @xmath179-simplices ) in its boundary .",
    "an orientation of @xmath177 is a choice of an ordering of these @xmath178 points , up to even permutations .",

    "two @xmath176-simplices that share an ( @xmath176 - 1)-simplex have consistent orientation if the shared ( @xmath176 - 1)-simplex inherits opposite orientations from the two @xmath176-simplices it bounds . a triangulation is orientable if it admits a consistent orientations of all its @xmath175-simplices .",
    "clearly , the triangulation of an orientable manifold is orientable .",
    "+ now , the notion of orientability extends to 2-complexes with 4-valent edges and 5-valent vertices .",
    "in fact , notice that in the boundary of an @xmath176-simplex of a triangulation , the ( @xmath176 - 1)-simplices are paired with the points ( the point that does not belong to the ( @xmath176 - 1)-simplex ) .",
    "thus , the ordering of the points corresponds to an ordering of the ( @xmath176 - 1)-simplices .",
    "consequently , we can simply define the orientation of a vertex of a 2-complex as an ordering of its adjacent edges , up to even permutations . in turn",

    "a moment of scrutiny of the vertex shows that the pairing of the strands discussed above ( in defining the parity of the loops ) determines always an odd permutation .",

    "[ more precisely , the intrinsic geometry of a classical tetrahedron in 4d is determined by six numbers ( 4x4 coordinates of the vertices , minus ten dimensions from the poincar group ) , but two of these quantities do not commute as quantum operators and therefore only five quantum numbers fix the state . ] therefore , we can view @xmath198 as a quantum amplitude for a certain geometry of a tetrahedron or , more generally , of an elementary `` chunk '' of space , with a certain volume , and bounded by four elementary surfaces with a certain area .",
