    "galaxy clusters constitute an important cosmological probe , in particular in determining the hubble constant @xmath0 through the combined analysis of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) @xcite and x - ray observations .",

    ", the mean value of @xmath0 estimated from sze and x - ray appears systematically lower than those estimated with other methods : e.g. @xmath2 from the distance to cepheids @xcite , and @xmath3 from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy @xcite .",
    "possible systematic errors in the @xmath0 measurement from the sze have been extensively studied by several authors @xcite ; they have addressed a number of physical sources of possible biases including the finite extension , clumpiness , asphericity , and non - isothermality of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "nevertheless they were not able to identify any systematic error that affects the estimate of @xmath0 by 10 - 15 percent .",
    "therefore it has been generally believed that the reliability of @xmath0 from the sze is dominated by the statistics .",
    "given that , the 10 - 15 percent underestimate bias mentioned above , if real , needs to be explained in terms of additional icm physics beyond the simple models used in previous studies .",
    "recently , @xcite have pointed out that the spectroscopic temperature , @xmath4 , is systematically lower than the emission - weighted temperature , @xmath5 .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) investigated the origin of the discrepancy and found that both the fluctuation of density and temperature and non - isothermality cause the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they also found that the probability density functions ( pdf ) of both density and temperature are well approximated by the log - normal function .",
    "the aim of the paper is to revisit the origin of the bias based on an observable quantity , @xmath4 and the log - normal description for fluctuations of icm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly review the conventional method to estimate @xmath0 from the spherical isothermal @xmath6 modeling of galaxy clusters .",
    "then we describe several possible sources of the systematic bias based on the log - normal description of the fluctuations and the spectroscopic temperature .",
    "we propose an analytical model for the bias in  3 .",
    "non - spherical effects are considered in  4 on the basis of triaxial model clusters which include the log - normal fluctuation and the temperature profile .",
    "section 5 explores the validity of our analytic model for the systematic bias using clusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "appendix a describes the semi - analytic distribution function of the bias of the estimated hubble constant due to the asphericity of clusters .",
    "a conventional estimate of @xmath0 from the sze is based on the assumptions that the gas temperature is isothermal , @xmath7 (= const . ) , and that the gas density follows the spherical @xmath6 model : @xmath8^{-3 \\beta/2 } , \\label{eq : beta - model}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the central density , @xmath10 is the core radius , and @xmath6 is the index characterizing the density profile .",
    "these approximations are insufficient to model the full complexity of real galaxy clusters .",
    "it has been ( implicitly ) assumed that the average over a number of clusters should significantly reduce the resulting error in the estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "while we will quantitatively argue below that this is not the case , we summarize here the commonly adopted estimator for @xmath0 in the spherical isothermal @xmath6 model @xcite .    in this idealistic model , the x - ray surface brightness and @xmath11-parameter of sze at an angle @xmath12 from the center of cluster",

    "note that the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) is written entirely in terms of observable quantities .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) corresponds to the estimate of the core radius along the line - of - sight .",
    "if the cluster is spherically symmetric , it should be equal to the core radius in the plane of the sky . with the assumption , the measured angular core radius , @xmath26 ,",
    "is related to the physical core radius simply by @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the angular diameter distance of the cluster at @xmath19 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) and ( [ eq : rcfit ] ) may be combined to estimate the angular diameter distance to the cluster @xcite : @xmath29 if one obtains @xmath30 for a number of clusters at different redshifts , one can estimate cosmological parameters by fitting to the angular diameter distance vs. redshift relation , @xmath28 . in",
    "what follows , however , we consider the above methodology for the purpose of estimating @xmath0 . thus following @xcite , we introduce the ratio of the estimated to the true value of @xmath0 : @xmath31 equations ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) and ( [ eq : rcfit ] ) provide commonly used estimators for the radius of clusters along and perpendicular to the line - of - sight , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively , but they are model - dependent and ill - defined for generic non - spherical clusters .",
    "we will come back to this issue below (  4 and 5 ) .",
    "note that @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) corresponds to over(under)-estimate the true @xmath0 .",
    "given the approximations underlying the spherical isothermal @xmath6 model , it is not surprising that @xmath36 for a individual cluster deviates from unity .",
    "a more relevant question is whether the average over a number of clusters , @xmath37 , is still systematically larger or smaller than unity .",
    "if such systematic errors exist , can we correct for them by identifying their physical origin ?",
    "this is what we address in the present paper .",
    "in fact there are several previous attempts toward the same goal , mainly utilizing numerically simulated galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "they concluded that departure from the sphericity and the isothermality of clusters results in @xmath38 , but after averaging over a sample the systematic errors are relatively small , @xmath39% .",
    "our analysis below is different from the previous ones in adopting the spectroscopic temperature , @xmath4 , for @xmath40 .",
    "indeed @xmath40 is a somewhat ambiguous quantify for actual clusters ( not isothermal ) .",
    "it has been common in this field to assume that the emission - weighted temperature : @xmath41 is approximately equal to @xmath4 ( the above integration is carried out over the entire cluster volume ) .",
    "thus the previous conclusion is entirely based on the assumption that @xmath42 . recently , however , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that @xmath4 , estimated by fitting the thermal continuum and the emission lines of the x - ray spectrum , is systematically lower than @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore in paper i we found that the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath4 could be explained through an analytic model of the temperature profile and inhomogeneities in the icm .",
    "we will evaluate @xmath36 applying the model and then comparing the numerical simulations in the subsequent sections .",
    "identifying possible systematic errors in the estimate of @xmath0 for realistic clusters is inevitably complicated . in order to address the problem as analytically as possible , we consider spherical clusters that follow a density profile of equation ( [ eq : beta - model ] ) and a polytropic temperature profile but with log - normal density and temperature fluctuations . while the approach in this section is not entirely generic , it is useful in understanding the physical origin of systematic errors .",
    "the present analytic modeling will be tested against numerically generated triaxial cluster samples in  [ sec : numerical ] , and against those from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "our task here is to derive analytic expressions for more general cases , which correspond to equations ( [ eq : sx ] ) to ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) in the case of the isothermal @xmath6 model .",
    "let us consider first the effect of inhomogeneities in icm .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness at the center of the cluster is written as an integral over the line - of - sight : @xmath43 paper i found that the fluctuation fields defined as @xmath44 and @xmath45 are approximately independent and follow the @xmath46-_independent _ log - normal pdf , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the standard deviations of the density and temperature logarithms .",
    "the average of equation ( [ eq : sx0 - 1los ] ) over many independent line - of - sights can then be computed by integrating over the log - normal pdfs .",
    "if we further assume that the cooling function , @xmath18 , is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung ( bolometric ) , @xmath51 , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : sx0 - 1los ] ) as @xmath52 on the contrary , their fluctuations do not affect @xmath24 because the integrand of the @xmath11-parameter is a linear function of both temperature and density .",
    "thus the inhomogeneity effect is well described by the factor : @xmath53 the polytropic temperature profile is expressed as @xmath54^{\\gamma - 1 } , \\label{eq : polytropic}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the central temperature ( at @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 is the polytropic index .",
    "then we obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "therefore , the core radius in this model is written as @xmath60 ^ 2 } .",
    "\\label{eq : rcp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if one attempts to fit the x - ray surface brightness profile under the assumption of the isothermal @xmath6 model , the fitted value of the @xmath6 parameter should be @xmath61 since @xmath62",
    "n(r)^2 \\propto t(r)^{1/2 } n(r)^2",
    "\\propto [ n(r)^{(\\gamma + 3)/4}]^2 $ ] . in addition , the fitted temperature should be equal to the spectroscopic temperature @xmath63 .",
    "thus the estimated core radius is given by equation ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) : @xmath64 ^ 2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the systematic bias in the estimate of the hubble constant in this particular model should be @xmath65 ^ 2 }   \\frac{[g ( \\beta_{\\rm fit}/2)]^2}{g ( \\beta_{\\rm fit } ) } \\cr & = & \\chi_{\\sigma } \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm bremss}(t_0)/t_0 ^ 2}{\\lambda_{\\rm bremss}({t_{\\mathrm{spec}}})/{t_{\\mathrm{spec}}}^2 } \\left[\\frac{g(\\beta(\\gamma+3)/8)}{g(\\beta \\gamma/2)}\\right]^2   \\equiv \\chi_{\\sigma } \\chi_{\\rm t}({t_{\\mathrm{spec}}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath66 that expresses the effect of the temperature structure in the icm",
    ".    it may be more instructive to rewrite equation ( [ eq : fh_polylnisobeta1 ] ) as @xmath67 since @xmath68 was often assumed to be equal to @xmath5 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fh_polylnisobeta2 ] ) makes it clear that the systematic bias in the estimate of @xmath0 results from three major effects ; @xmath69 due to inhomogeneities in the icm , @xmath70 representing the temperature structure assuming that @xmath71 , and finally @xmath72 coming from the difference from the spectroscopic and the emission - weighted temperatures of the icm .    those three factors can be expressed in an approximate but analytic fashion as follows .",
    "if we adopt the log - normal pdf for the density and temperature inhomogeneities in the icm , @xmath73 ( eq.[[eq : chisigma ] ] ) .",
    "as shown in paper i , cosmological hydrodynamic simulations indicate that @xmath74@xmath75 and @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "the second factor can be estimated by using the analytical relation of @xmath55 and @xmath5 in the current model : @xmath80 where we assume that the cluster has a finite extension and @xmath81 for the radius @xmath46 beyond the virial radius of the cluster , @xmath82 , and we define @xmath83   ; 5/2 ; -{r_{\\mathrm{vir}}}^2/r_c^2 ) } { \\,_2 f_1 ( 3/2,3 \\beta [ 1   + ( \\gamma-1)/4 ] ; 5/2 ; -{r_{\\mathrm{vir}}}^2/r_c^2 ) } ,   \\label{eq : tewp_poly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath84 being the hyper - geometric function ( see  3 of paper i ) . just for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the term , @xmath85 , that represents the temperature inhomogeneity because it is relatively small for @xmath86 .",
    "if we further adopt @xmath87 then @xmath88 reduces to @xmath89 ^ 2}{[g(\\beta \\gamma/2)]^2 } \\cr & = &   j(\\beta,\\gamma , r_c/{r_{\\mathrm{vir}}})^{1.5 }   \\frac{[g(\\beta ( \\gamma+3)/8)]^2}{[g(\\beta \\gamma/2)]^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result is plotted in figure [ fig : p ] for typical values of the parameters , and indicates that @xmath70 ranges from 0.8 to 1.0 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "similarly the third factor can be approximated as @xmath92 several studies confirmed the systematic underestimate of the spectroscopic temperature relative to the emission - weighted temperature , @xmath93 from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "if @xmath94 0.8 ( 0.9 ) , for instance , @xmath95 amounts to 0.7 ( 0.85 ) .",
    "so far we have only considered spherical clusters .",
    "asphericity is definitely another important source of error in the estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "the errors are expected to be significantly reduced by averaging over a statistical sample of clusters randomly oriented with respect to our line - of - sight . nevertheless",
    ", if clusters preferentially take either prolate or oblate shapes , for instance , the residual errors may not be entirely negligible .",
    "this is why we address the effect of asphericity on the basis of the triaxial approximation for the cluster icm @xcite .    to investigate quantitatively the combined effects of gas inhomogeneity and asphericity",
    ", we numerically create three sets of cluster samples and perform mock observations of monte - carlo realizations .",
    "the first one is spherical , but include random gas density and temperature fluctuations according to the log - normal distribution .",
    "the second one is triaxial without the fluctuations .",
    "both the first and the second samples assume isothermality ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the third one corresponds to the model described in  3 except for added asphericity ; the log - normal fluctuations , the polytropic temperature structure , and the triaxiality are included .",
    "we call them _ model clusters _ in order to distinguish them from _ simulated clusters _ extracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (  5 ) .",
    "each model cluster is constructed on @xmath97 grid points within 6 @xmath98 cubic region around the center .",
    "we first create spherically symmetric clusters with the gas density profile following equation ( [ eq : beta - model ] ) with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the gas is fiducially isothermal with @xmath102 kev , while we also consider the case of polytropic temperature profile with @xmath103 kev and @xmath104 .",
    "we then add random fluctuations of gas density and temperature according to the @xmath46-independent log - normal distributions .",
    "the x - ray emissivity is computed with spex version 2.0 assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , the energy range of @xmath105 kev and a constant metallicity @xmath106 .",
    "triaxial model clusters are constructed simply by stretching spherical clusters along the three axis directions by a factor of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , respectively .    in mock observations ,",
    "we extract the quantities necessary to compute @xmath110 and @xmath111 via equations ( [ eq : rcisobeta ] ) and ( [ eq : rcfit ] ) in the following manner .",
    "we first fit the projected profiles of @xmath112 with a functional form @xmath113^{-3 \\beta_{\\rm fit } + 1/2}$ ] from @xmath114 to @xmath115 over 1024 random loss toward each cluster . for each los",
    ", we also compute @xmath24 and , unless otherwise stated , use it directly in our analysis .",
    "we will discuss other choices of obtaining @xmath24 in  5.3 .",
    "as will be described later , the gas temperature @xmath68 is obtained by either fitting the mock x - ray spectra or simply using the input temperature , depending on the purpose of the analysis .",
    "we use the template of the spectral energy distribution computed using spex 2.0 assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , the energy range of @xmath116 and a constant metallicity @xmath117 . assuming that @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    ", we calculate @xmath36 for each los .",
    "to quantify the bias due to the projection effect , we also compute the volume - averaged radial profile of the gas density , directly from the grid data within the radius @xmath120 . by fitting the profile to the @xmath6 model ,",
    "we obtain the estimated core radius @xmath121 , which is independent of los .",
    "we will compare the values of @xmath36 using @xmath122 and @xmath123 in what follows .",
    "figure [ fig : imo]a shows the mean and rms values of @xmath36 for spherical clusters with no temperature gradient .",
    "we consider two cases for the log - normal density and temperature fluctuations with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the latter set corresponds to the typical value for the simulated cluster as paper i reported . to present the bias produced solely by gas inhomogeneities , we here adopt for @xmath40 the volume averaged temperature instead of fitting the mock x - ray spectra .",
    "it is evident that the fluctuations in gas density yield @xmath126 ( i.e. overestimating of @xmath0 by @xmath127 ) , while those in gas temperature do not contribute significantly to the bias .",
    "the mean value of @xmath36 is in good agreement with our analytical expectation @xmath69 ( dashed horizontal lines ) .",
    "the bias due to the projection is @xmath128 .    the bias produced by ellipsoidal shapes is displayed in figure [ fig : imo]b for the two sets of the axis ratio ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) .",
    "these sets are the typical value of the simulated cluster .",
    "again , to present the bias solely from asphericity , the gas is assumed to be isothermal without any fluctuations and we adopt @xmath131 in computing @xmath36 .",
    "the average bias is relatively small ( @xmath132 ) and that due to the projection is @xmath133 .",
    "these results indicate that the bias due to asphericity , after averaging over a statistical sample of clusters , is smaller than that from gas inhomogeneity .",
    "figure [ fig : imo]c illustrates the bias in a more realistic case ; we create ellipsoidal clusters with the polytropic temperature profile and fluctuations .",
    "two sets of axis ratio ( @xmath134 and @xmath130 ) are chosen adopting @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively . in this panel ,",
    "we show the values of @xmath36 based on the following three methods , so as to understand clearly the physical origin of the overall bias in the @xmath0 estimation .",
    "the first method ( black symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : imo]c ) corresponds to the most conventional case of using the isothermal @xmath6-model and the spectroscopic temperature @xmath63 . to obtain @xmath63 we fit the mock x - ray spectra from the central ( @xmath137 @xmath138 ) region of each cluster using xspec assuming a single temperature mekal model .",
    "we assume the perfect response , and ignore its effect on the spectral temperature ( paper i ) . clearly , the value of @xmath0 is _ underestimated _ by @xmath139-@xmath140 .",
    "this is in good agreement with our analytical estimation for @xmath141 for a spherical cluster ( solid horizontal lines ) . to obtain @xmath142 , we compute the volume - averaged profile of the density and the temperature . these profile",
    "are fitted to equation ( [ eq : beta - model ] ) and equation ( [ eq : polytropic ] ) taking @xmath9 , @xmath121 , @xmath6 , @xmath55 and @xmath57 as free parameters .",
    "we use the adopted values @xmath143 and @xmath136 to compute @xmath144 .    the second method ( red symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : imo]c ) aims to mimic previous numerical studies of the @xmath0 bias @xcite and adopts the isothermal @xmath6-model and the emission - weighted temperature @xmath145 .",
    "we obtain @xmath5 by directly summing up the temperature of each grid point from the central ( @xmath137 @xmath98 ) region .",
    "also plotted for comparison is an analytical estimate @xmath146 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the values of @xmath144 and @xmath147 are computed as described above . in this case ,",
    "@xmath144 and @xmath147practically cancel each other , and @xmath36 is close to unity , consistent with the previous findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this shows that the absence of the bias in previous studies is simply an artifact of using @xmath5 , which is systematically larger than @xmath63 .    the third method ( blue symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : imo]c ) attempts to eliminate the bias due to the temperature gradient by using the polytropic profile to estimate the core radius @xcite : @xmath148 ^ 2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we adopt @xmath55 and @xmath57 from fitting the volume - averaged temperature profile of the model clusters .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is obtained from equation ( [ eq : betafit ] ) using @xmath149 and @xmath57 .",
    "the value of @xmath36 so obtained should represent the bias arising from sources _ other than _ the spectral fitting and the temperature gradient . given the good agreement with the analytical estimate for @xmath69 ( dashed lines ) ,",
    "we conclude that the bias in this case is dominated by the effect from gas inhomogeneities .    in summary",
    ", there are three major sources for the bias of @xmath0 ; the spectral fitting , the temperature gradient , and local density fluctuations . the former two leads to an _ underestimate _ while the latter an _ overestimate _ of @xmath0 . in every case",
    "studied here , the bias due to asphericity is much smaller than the other three .",
    "we now compare the bias described in the previous section with simulated clusters .",

    "we choose the six massive clusters identified as coma , perseus , virgo , centaurus , a3627 , and hydra .",

    "a detailed description of this procedure is given in paper i.    we perform mock observations over 1024 loss for each simulated cluster in a similar manner to  [ sec : numerical ] except for the following points .",
    "first , we compute @xmath4 and @xmath5 within the virial radius instead of 1 @xmath98 .",
    "second , we use the fitted value of @xmath49 and @xmath50 in calculating @xmath69 of the analytical model",
    ".    .properties of the six simulated clusters . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure [ fig : dist ] displays a set of histograms of @xmath36 for the simulated coma cluster .",
    "the same analysis is done for the other five clusters .",
    "histograms in different colors correspond to the symbols of the same color in figure [ fig : imo]c , and indeed show similar trends for each component of the bias . since the physical length of clusters along",
    "the los is not symmetrically distributed around its mean , the corresponding histograms of @xmath36 are skewed positively . in appendix",
    "a , we compute the distribution for the two extreme cases , the prolate and the oblate ellipsoids , and find that they yield positively and negatively skewed distributions , respectively . indeed this is consistent with the fact that the simulated coma is nearly prolate ( table [ tab : axisratio ] ) .",
    "the ( simple arithmetic ) mean , @xmath37 is plotted in figure [ fig : avestd ] for six simulated clusters .",
    "the quoted error bars indicate 1@xmath159 standard deviation from the mean . except for the simulated virgo cluster",
    ", @xmath37 is below unity , i.e. , @xmath0 is _ underestimated_. it is remarkable that a simple analytical model for systematic effects ( solid , dotted and dashed horizontal lines ) described in  [ sec : analytic ] can reproduce the bias in the simulated clusters .",
    "we have made sure that the bias from other sources is minor ; first , if a cluster has a finite extension and is bounded within the virial radius , the value of @xmath37 becomes smaller by @xmath160 ( open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : avestd ] ) .",
    "second , we compute the axis ratio ( @xmath161 ) of each simulated cluster , basically following the method of @xcite , but using the gas density not the dark matter density . the isodensity surfaces corresponding to the gas densities of @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 [ @xmath167 are shown in figure [ fig : ac ] . after eliminating substructures ,",
    "the axis ratio is calculated by diagonalizing the inertial tensor of each surface",
    ". the averaged axis ratios of the five different density regions ( table [ tab : axisratio ] ) are similar to the typical value adopted in  4 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the spherical approximation itself is not a major source of the bias for the simulated cluster . finally , the bias due to the projection is small ( crosses and pluses in fig .",
    "[ fig : avestd ] ) .",
    "we list in table [ tab : axisratio ] the average values of @xmath123 over 1024 loss relative to @xmath121 .",
    "the ratio is unity within 10 % ( except for virgo that has a relatively large dispersion ) , and basically all consistent with unity within the uncertainty .",
    "it is interesting to emphasize here that the shape of the distribution of @xmath36 reflects the shape of clusters from the perspective of measuring the three - dimensional shape of clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . if all clusters had the same shape , the observation of one cluster toward _ multiple directions _ might correspond to that of _ multiple clusters _ toward each los .",
    "of course , the real shapes vary from cluster to cluster . however ,",
    "if clusters tend to be prolate ( oblate ) preferentially , the distribution of @xmath168 should be skewed positively ( negatively ) as shown in appendix a. therefore , independently of the knowledge of real value of @xmath169 , the statistical information about the shape distribution may be obtained _ in principle _ by the distribution of @xmath168 .",
    "the above results are consistent with the previous results of @xmath170 with @xmath42 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite explored the bias of @xmath171 using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , and reported that @xmath0 is _ overestimated _ by more than a factor of two if one adopts the isothermal @xmath6 model .",
    "this is opposite to our conclusion here , and we found that this should be ascribed to the sensitivity of @xmath172 on the adopted values of @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath173 as explained below .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath24 by fitting the noise - less profile of @xmath174 up to @xmath175 fixing other @xmath6-model parameters from the x - ray profile , while we use directly the projected values of @xmath24 in the simulation data .",
    "the difference in these two methods is apparent in figure 5 ( right panel ) of @xcite ; their fit ( solid line ) was affected largely by the data points at large radii and yielded a value of @xmath24 smaller by @xmath176 than the actual data .",
    "this enhances the value of @xmath172 by more than a factor of two , and indeed accounts for their apparently opposite conclusions .",
    "we have checked that other differences between their analysis and ours ( the use of mass - weighted temperature for @xmath40 and the removal of the cluster central region ) do not affect the results significantly .    as far as the bias in the previous sze observations is concerned , we believe that our method is more relevant to what has been done with the real data , because these observations were not capable of constraining the radial profile of the y - parameter up to large radii with high s / n ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the currently highest angular - resolution observation of the sze ) .",
    "we have further made sure that the effects of the finite spatial resolution of the observations and the central cooling region , which were neglected in our preceding analysis , are minor ; first , we have evaluated @xmath24 by fitting @xmath174 within a radius of 100 @xmath177 and 200 @xmath178 .",
    "these approximately correspond to the typical angular resolution of the sze observation ( @xmath179 1 minute ) at @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath182 are fixed from the x - ray profile .",
    "for the six simulated clusters , the resulting values of @xmath172 differ from our initial analysis ( see fig . [",
    "fig : avestd ] ) by @xmath183 to @xmath184 ( @xmath185 on average ) for @xmath186 , and by @xmath187 to @xmath188 ( @xmath189 on average ) for @xmath190 .",
    "second , we have also performed the fitting separately for the x - ray and sze profiles .",
    "the values of @xmath191 , @xmath6 and @xmath182 are evaluated by fitting @xmath112 with equation ( [ eq : sx ] ) , while that of @xmath24 is obtained by fitting @xmath174 with equation ( [ eq : y ] ) independently of the x - ray profile . as a result ,",
    "the values of @xmath172 differ from those of figure [ fig : avestd ] by @xmath183 and @xmath192 ( @xmath187 on average ) .",
    "note that observationally there are several different ways to evaluate @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath6 and @xmath182 .",
    "a conventional method is to fit the x - ray imaging data @xmath112 first .",
    "then the sz image is fitted to obtain @xmath24 assuming the values of @xmath6 and @xmath182 from the x - ray data .",
    "our analysis procedure adopted here follows the conventional method . while @xcite have determined @xmath193 from the joint fit to the x - ray and sze imaging data ,",
    "the result is almost equivalent to the conventional method since the x - ray imaging data have a much higher s / n than the sze data .",
    "we considered various possible systematic errors of @xmath0 from the combined analysis of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and x - ray observations .",
    "in particular we addressed the validity and limitation of the spherical isothermal @xmath6 model in estimating @xmath0 , which has been used widely as a reasonable approximation after averaging over a number of clusters .",
    "we introduced the ratio of the estimated to the true hubble constant , @xmath194 , to characterize the systematic errors .",
    "we constructed an analytic model for @xmath194 , and identified three important sources for the systematic errors ; density and temperature inhomogeneities in the icm , the temperature profile , and departures from sphericity . except for the non - spherical effect , the most important analytical expression that summarizes",
    "our conclusion is equation ( [ eq : fh_polylnisobeta2 ] ) , or equivalently , @xmath195 in our analytic model discussed in  3 , the inhomogeneity bias , @xmath144 , the non - isothermality bias , @xmath70 , and the temperature bias @xmath95 are given by equations ( [ eq : chisigma ] ) , ( [ eq : chit ] ) , and ( [ eq : spec - ew ] ) , respectively .",
    "while the above model prediction is fairly general , the net value of @xmath172 sensitively depends on the degree of the inhomogeneity and multi - phase temperature structure of real icm .",
    "our simulated cluster sample implies that @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and therefore @xmath199 .",
    "given the result of @xcite , this is certainly indicative , but may need to be interpreted with caution because the result is critically dependent on the reliability of the adopted numerically simulated clusters as representative samples of clusters observed in the real universe .",
    "exactly for this reason , we are attempting more direct ( not statistical ) comparison of our model prediction against observed cluster samples , which will be presented elsewhere hopefully in the near future ( reese et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we thank noriko yamasaki and kazuhisa mitsuda for useful discussions , klaus dolag for providing a set of simulated cluster samples , and erik reese for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for several constructive comments .",
    "the simulations were performed at the data - reservoir at the university of tokyo , and we thank mary inaba and kei hiraki for providing the computational resources . this work is supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research of japanese ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( nos . 14102204 , 15740157 , 16340053 , 18740112 , and 18072002 ) , and by jsps ( japan society for promotion of science ) core - to - core program `` international research network for dark energy '' .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the distribution of @xmath36 due to the asphericity of clusters , by considering the following two extreme cases ; the prolate ( @xmath200 ) and the oblate ( @xmath201 ) ellipsoids . we choose @xmath19-axis as the long ( short ) axis and @xmath202- and @xmath11-axes as the short ( long ) axes for an prolate ( oblate ) ellipsoid .",
    "the direction of the unit vector along the los of an observer , @xmath203 , is defined in terms of the spherical coordinate ( @xmath204 , @xmath205 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sp ] shows a schematic picture of a prolate ellipsoid .    let us define the quantity @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) for the prolate ( oblate ) ellipsoid .",
    "we assume that the gas density follows the _ prolate ( oblate ) _ @xmath6 model : @xmath208^{1/2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath209 is the angle between @xmath19-axis and @xmath210 . because the surface brightness profile is independent of @xmath205 due to the @xmath19-axial symmetry",
    ", one can express @xmath36 as function of @xmath204 .",
    "for an isothermal cluster , the surface brightness averaged over a circle of radius @xmath211 is proportional to @xmath212 averaged over the angle @xmath213 of the circle .",
    "we put @xmath214 where @xmath210 is located on the same plane defined by the los and @xmath19-axis . to compute the averaged surface brightness",

    "we compute @xmath233 numerically for @xmath234 ( prolate ) and @xmath235 ( oblate ) adopting @xmath236 .",
    "we fit @xmath237 from @xmath238 to @xmath239 by with a functional form of the surface brightness profile assuming the spherical beta model @xmath240^{-3 \\beta_{\\mathrm{fit}|{\\theta_{{{\\bf a}}}}}+1/2})$ ] .",
    "thus , we obtain the counter part of @xmath241 , @xmath242 and the fitted value of @xmath6 , @xmath243 . while , @xmath244 is written as @xmath245 the first term of the right - hand side represents the elongation of the radius toward the los .",
    "the second term is the correction to the use of @xmath243 in observation instead of the true @xmath6 .",
    "however , the correction is very small ( within 0.01% error ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the bias of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath204 , @xmath246 the probability of @xmath36 for the random assignment is proportional to the solid angle @xmath247 .",
    "if @xmath248 is a monotonic function , the pdf of @xmath36 is obtained as @xmath249 where @xmath250 .",

    ", @xmath36 is equal to @xmath252 , which corresponds to the case that the los is along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "the pdf diverges at @xmath253 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "equations ( [ eq : rcisobetathetaa ] ) to ( [ eq : pfh ] ) imply that @xmath254 where we ignore the @xmath204-dependence of @xmath255 and @xmath243 .",

    "note , however , its integration over a finite size of @xmath36 does not diverge ( see eq.[[eq : pfh ] ] ) .",
    "this is plotted in the solid histograms , where the bin size @xmath259 is adopted .",
    "the resulting distribution is skewed positively ( negatively ) for the prolate ( oblate ) ellipsoid , which is consistent with the results shown in figure [ fig : dist ] .",
