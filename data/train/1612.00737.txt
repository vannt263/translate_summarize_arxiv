    "a class of nontopological solitons , initially proposed in @xcite and known as q - balls @xcite , has been widely discussed in the literature during the past years .",
    "it is interesting to mention that generalization from the global @xmath0 symmetry to the gauge @xmath0 symmetry was proposed in the paper @xcite , which was published together with @xcite ( in the same issue of the journal ) .",
    "later such a theory was examined in the well - known paper @xcite .",
    "one can also recall papers @xcite , where gauged q - balls gauged q - balls `` gauged q - balls '' . ]",
    "were examined mainly from a theoretical point of view , as well as papers @xcite , where solutions for gauged q - ball were obtained numerically .",
    "stability of such nontopological soliton solutions , in particular , the classical stability , is an important problem .",
    "the well - known classical stability criterion for ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls , which is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the q - ball charge , was derived in @xcite .",
    "one may suppose that analogous classical stability criterion is valid for @xmath0 gauged q - balls . however , there is no any rigorous mathematical proof supporting this hypothesis .    in the present paper",
    "we will try to derive the classical stability criterion for such gauged q - balls . instead of using the approach of @xcite , for the calculations we will apply the vakhitov - kolokolov method @xcite , which was used for derivation of the classical stability criterion for the systems described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( for a more detailed discussion of the stability of localized solutions in the systems described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation , see @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that this method works very well for the case of ordinary one - field and two - field q - balls , but does not provide any information about possible classical stability criterion of @xmath0 gauged q - balls , although all the technical steps of calculations can be performed in this case too .",
    "we will also provide numerical simulations of classical ( in)stabilities in models with different scalar field potentials , supporting the results of analytical considerations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . as a demonstration of the vakhitov - kolokolov method , in section  2 we present the proof of the classical stability criterion for the case of ordinary one - filed and two - field q - balls . in section",
    "3 we make an attempt to derive the classical stability criterion for the case of @xmath0 gauged q - balls and discuss the reasons why this attempt is unsuccessful .",
    "we also present the results of numerical simulations of classical ( in)instabilities of gauged q - balls . in conclusion",
    "we briefly discuss the obtained results .",
    "in this section , we will derive the classical stability criterion for the case of one - field and two - field q - balls .",
    "for the first time , this criterion was derived in @xcite for one - field q - balls and in @xcite for the model with two scalar fields , which was proposed and examined in that paper .",
    "the proof of @xcite was based on examining the properties of the energy functional of the system , while keeping the charge fixed . as was noted in the introduction , instead of using the same approach",
    ", we will apply the vakhitov - kolokolov method @xcite , which was used to obtain the classical stability criterion for the systems described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this method is based on the use of only the linearized equations of motion for the perturbations above the background solution .",
    "we will apply this method to the case of @xmath0 gauged q - balls , but first we will demonstrate how it works in the simpler cases of ordinary one - field and two - field q - balls ( from the mathematical point of view , two - field q - balls are closer to the gauged q - balls than the one - field q - balls , so the explicit examination of this case makes sense ) .",
    "so , let us proceed to the case of one - field q - balls , which we will study in detail .",
    "let us start with the standard action , describing a complex scalar field @xmath3 in the flat ( d+1)-dimensional space - time with the coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; in the form @xmath6 for a q - ball solution , we consider the standard ansatz @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a real function which is supposed to have no nodes ( without loss of generality , we can set @xmath10 for any @xmath11 ) and to satisfy the conditions @xmath12 in this case , the function @xmath9 satisfies the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the charge of a q - ball is defined in the standard way as @xmath15    in order to examine the classical stability of a q - ball , on should consider small perturbations above the background solution and examine the corresponding linearized equations of motion .",
    "the standard ansatz for the perturbations takes the form @xcite @xmath16 note that the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not supposed to be spherically symmetric . from the very beginning , it is convenient to use the notations @xmath19 with these notations , the corresponding linearized equations of motion take the form @xmath20 where the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined as @xmath23 with @xmath24 possible instabilities are described by solutions to equations , with @xmath25 .",
    "using equations and it is possible to show ( see the detailed derivation in appendix  a ) that the following relation fulfills @xmath26 this equation has two obvious solutions : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a real constant .",
    "since we are interested in classical instabilities , below we will consider only the case @xmath28 .",
    "as was noted above , the unstable modes can only have the form @xmath30 where @xmath29 is a real constant and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are real functions . in",
    "what follows , we will consider @xmath33 and use the notations @xmath34 , @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in these notations , the linearized equations of motion",
    "take the form @xmath38 let us introduce the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 and the operator @xmath42 note that we have added @xmath43 to the definition of the operator @xmath40 .",
    "the necessity for this step will become clear later .    in the operator form , the linearized equations of motion for the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 look like @xmath44 where the notation @xmath45 is introduced for convenience .",
    "now let us look at the properties of perturbations , following from the linearized equations of motion .",
    "first , by multiplying equation by @xmath46 , integrating the result over the spatial volume and using the fact that @xmath47 ( see equation ) , we get @xmath48 where @xmath49 relation is simply the consequence of the total charge conservation .",
    "second , there are obvious zero modes ( i.e. , the eigenstates with the zero eigenvalue , not the lowest modes ) of the operator @xmath50 : @xmath51 the existence of the eigenstates @xmath52 , @xmath53 , is the corollary of the fact that @xmath54 , whereas @xmath55 are just the translational modes .",
    "note that since @xmath10 for any @xmath11 , it is the eigenfunction of the lowest eigenstate of the operator @xmath40 with the eigenvalue @xmath56 ( for example , for @xmath57 it corresponds to the @xmath58 level in the spherically symmetric quantum mechanical potential @xmath59 ) , so all the eigenstates of the operator @xmath50 with the zero and negative eigenvalues are defined by the corresponding eigenstates of the operator @xmath39 . to the definition of the operator @xmath40",
    " all eigenvalues of @xmath40 are positive and there are no zero modes of the operator @xmath50 coming from @xmath40 . ] at this point we should impose the following restriction on the spectrum of the operator @xmath39 , which is crucial for the subsequent proof :    * the operator @xmath39 has _ only one _ negative eigenvalue",
    ".    for the one - dimensional case @xmath60 this restriction fulfills automatically .",
    "indeed , the translational mode @xmath61 has only one node , thus there is only one eigenstate with negative eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "however , this is not so for the case @xmath62 .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 the translational modes @xmath55 form the @xmath63 level and it is possible that this level is energetically higher than , say , @xmath58 and @xmath64 levels ( for an example of such situation in atomic physics , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the restriction on the number of eigenstates of @xmath39 with negative eigenvalues seems to be fulfilled at least for the simple scalar field potentials which are usually considered for q - balls .    and",
    "third , from equation it follows that @xmath65 it is clear that if @xmath66 , then there are no unstable modes above the q - ball solution .",
    "so , the question is under which conditions the lowest possible value of @xmath67 is positive , taking into account the extra condition ?",
    "this question leads to the variational problem for the functional @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the lagrange multipliers , the second lagrange multiplier @xmath70 stands for the normalization condition @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a real constant of the corresponding dimension .",
    "the standard variational procedure leads to the equation @xmath73 now we take the orthonormal system of eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath50 , which is supposed to be full , and decompose @xmath74 and @xmath75 in these eigenfunctions .",
    "let us label the lowest eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the operator @xmath50 as @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , where @xmath78 ( as was noted above , we suppose that there is only one such eigenvalue ) , the zero modes @xmath79 correspond to the eigenvalue @xmath80 , all the other modes @xmath81 with @xmath82 are such that @xmath83 .",
    "we also choose @xmath81 such that they are dimensionless and @xmath84 for any @xmath85 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath86 , so the decomposition of @xmath75 takes the form is not necessarily discrete , there may exist a continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "so , the most general form of the decomposition looks like @xmath87 .",
    "however , the existence of the continuous part of the spectrum does not change the proof if @xmath88 .",
    "so , for the sake of simplicity , below we will use the decomposition instead of the more general one . ]",
    "@xmath89 where @xmath90 are the coefficients of the decomposition .",
    "thus , from equation we get @xmath91 multiplying equation by @xmath92 , integrating the result over the spatial volume and using the conditions and @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath93 thus , the sign of @xmath67 is defined by the sign of @xmath70 .",
    "the next step of the proof is to find a minimal value of @xmath70 . to this end , we take equation and substitute and into it .",
    "we get the equation @xmath94 which defines possible values of @xmath70 for which the extra condition is satisfied .",
    "let us define the function @xmath95 it is clear that everywhere except the points @xmath96 , the function @xmath97 is a monotonically growing function . a schematic representation of this function is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally ,",
    "let us discuss the classical stability of gauged q - balls in this model for @xmath98 .",
    "classically stable and unstable gauged q - balls ( of course , with respect to spherically symmetric perturbations ) are marked in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] by the solid and dashed lines respectively .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] that there are stable solutions with @xmath1 and @xmath99 , as well as unstable solutions with @xmath1 and @xmath99 . at least among the obtained solutions ,",
    "classically stable gauged q - balls include only solutions from the family with @xmath100 and the `` gauged q - ball inside q - shell '' solutions .",
    "all other solutions are classically unstable . for example , the gauged q - ball solution , marked by the dot in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , belongs to the family with @xmath101 .",
    "evolution in time of this perturbed gauged q - ball is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , where the scalar field profile is presented at different moments of time .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 for this q - ball .",
    "this explicit example demonstrates that even in the case of spherically symmetric perturbations , there is no connection between the sign of @xmath102 and the classical stability of gauged q - balls in the general case , which supports the analytical results obtained in subsection  3.1 .",
    "thus , the classical stability criterion for nongauged q - balls @xmath1 can not be applied to gauged q - balls in the general case .    )",
    "is marked by the dot in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] . ]",
    "in the present paper , we examined the problem of classical stability of @xmath0 gauged q - balls . for ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls there exists the well - known classical stability criterion @xcite , stating that q - balls with @xmath1 are classically stable if the additional restriction on the number of negative eigenvalues of the corresponding operator ( the operator @xmath39 in our notations ) holds . in principle",
    ", the latter condition usually holds for ordinary q - balls .",
    "so , there arises the question whether this criterion is valid for @xmath0 gauged q - balls .    as a preliminary step",
    ", we presented the derivation of the classical stability criterion for the one - field and two - fields nongauged q - balls .",
    "contrary to the original derivation in @xcite , our method is based on the use of only the linearized equations of motion for the perturbations above the gauged q - ball . in fact , our method is a generalization of the well - known vakhitov - kolokolov method @xcite , which was used to obtain the classical stability criterion for the systems described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this generalized vakhitov - kolokolov approach was applied to the case of @xmath0 gauged q - balls . however , although all the technical steps of calculations can be performed in the same way as those for ordinary q - balls ( especially , for two - field q - balls ) , it is impossible to draw any conclusion about the validity of the classical stability criterion @xmath1 for the case of @xmath0 gauged q - balls .",
    "the problem is that , even in the simple case of spherically symmetric perturbations , the structure of the operator @xmath39 is such that it is very unlikely that it has only one negative eigenvalue , which is crucial for the validity of the classical stability criterion . in such a case",
    "one may conclude that the classical stability criterion @xmath1 , which is valid at least for most of the ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls , can not be applied to @xmath0 gauged q - balls in the general case .    to support the conclusion following from the analytical considerations , we performed numerical simulations of the time evolution of perturbed @xmath0 gauged q - balls for the case of spherically symmetric perturbations .",
    "the results of simulations demonstrate that there exist classically stable @xmath0 gauged q - balls with @xmath99 and , which is much more important , classically unstable @xmath0 gauged q - balls with @xmath1 . at the moment it is not clear whether the @xmath0 gauged q - balls , which are classically stable with respect to spherically symmetric perturbations , remain stable in the case of non - spherically - symmetric perturbations . in any case , the numerical simulations indeed support the conclusion that the standard classical stability criterion for ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls can not be applied to @xmath0 gauged q - balls in the general case .",

    "popov for valuable discussions .",
    "the work was supported by the grant 16 - 12 - 10494 of the russian science foundation .",
    "numerical calculations have been performed on the computational cluster of the theoretical division of inr ras .",
    "we thank g.  rubtsov for maintaining its stability .",
    "let us consider the quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "is defined as @xmath105 . ] from equations and we easily get @xmath106 again , using equations , we get @xmath107 equation was obtained using the fact that @xmath108 . using the obvious relation @xmath109 , from and we obtain @xmath110 substituting equations  into and multiplying the result by @xmath111 , we arrive at @xmath112    equation is fulfilled if one of the following simpler equations fulfills : @xmath113 let us consider the second equation .",
    "equation together with results in @xmath114 according to equation @xmath115 by the definition , the function @xmath116 for any @xmath11 , i.e. , it has no nodes .",
    "that means that @xmath46 is the eigenfunction of the lowest eigenstate ( in the case @xmath57 it corresponds to the @xmath58 level in the spherically symmetric quantum mechanical potential @xmath59 ) , and there are no negative eigenvalues of the operator @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath117 for any @xmath37 . since @xmath118 and @xmath119 , except the trivial solution @xmath120 , @xmath121 , equation has the following solutions : @xmath122 the first solution",
    "obviously does not indicate any instability , whereas the second solution together with equation also leads to @xmath123 .    finally , the only case , which can describe possible unstable modes ( i.e. , those with @xmath25 ) is defined by equation",
    "let us consider the following general form of perturbations above the two - field q - ball : @xmath124 the corresponding linearized equations of motion can be represented as @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 with @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 defined by , , and .",
    "again , as in the one - field case , from equations , we can get are defined as @xmath132 @xmath133 using equations , , we obtain @xmath134 equation was obtained using the fact that @xmath135 . using the obvious relation @xmath136 , from and we obtain @xmath137 substituting equations  into , we arrive at @xmath138 multiplying the latter equation by @xmath111 and using equation , we arrive at @xmath139 using the definition of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , finally we get @xmath142 where @xmath143 since , analogously to the one - field case , @xmath144 for any @xmath37 , nontrivial solutions with @xmath111 should satisfy the condition @xmath145 leading to @xmath27 or @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a real constant .",
    "thus , unstable modes can have only the form , .",
    "here we present a more detailed description of the numerical method used to solve the equations of motion , .",
    "first , we introduce the new variable @xmath146 which maps the infinite space on the unit size sphere . here",
    "@xmath147 is a constant parameter . with this coordinate ,",
    "the boundary conditions , appear to be imposed at the points @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in our simulations , we define the fields on the uniform grid with @xmath150 points which cover this interval .",
    "note that in terms of the physical distance the grid is not uniform .",
    "half of the grid points cover the range @xmath151 $ ] , where the grid is approximately uniform with the spacing varying from @xmath152 to @xmath153 .",
    "the remaining points cover the interval @xmath154 with the spacing @xmath155 for @xmath156 . in our simulations ,",
    "the parameter @xmath147 is chosen to be of the order of twice the q - ball radius , so we have approximately one and the same spacing @xmath157 in the region of the q - ball core .",
    "we use the second - order central finite difference formulas to discretize the derivatives with respect to time @xmath158 ( here @xmath158 is the dimensionless variable corresponding to the physical time @xmath159 ) and radius @xmath160 in the equations of motion for the fields .",
    "outgoing waves leaving the interaction region are removed with the help of the kreiss - oliger filter @xcite .",
    "after each time step @xmath161 we apply the following operator @xmath162 to the field @xmath3 , where @xmath163 is the constant introduced to maintain the stability of this procedure . for solutions which are smooth enough , this procedure modifies the scalar field by the fourth order term , which is smaller than the error of the numerical scheme in the region of the core of the gauged q - ball .    to demonstrate how this operator works ,",
    "let us consider its action ( with the derivative @xmath164 discretized by the second - order central finite difference formula ) on the fourier modes of the field @xmath3 .",
    "we get @xmath165 one can see that the low frequency modes with @xmath166 remain practically intact , their amplitudes appear to be modified by the factor @xmath167 , which is very close to unity .",
    "this is the case of the modes located in the central region @xmath151 $ ] in the physical space , where the grid resolution is high enough . as for the modes @xmath168 ,",
    "the factor in is less than unity in this case and the amplitudes of these modes vanish after @xmath169 time steps . roughly speaking",
    ", such modes correspond to the scalar modes which propagate in the physical space out from the q - ball core and appear in the region of the physical space where the grid is sparse .",
    "this method is similar to the one used in @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned above , the derivatives in the equations of motion are discretized by the second - order central finite difference formulas .",
    "the resulting system of the nonlinear equations of motion is solved by the variant of iterated crank - nicolson method used in @xcite .",
    "namely , for the time step @xmath170 , @xmath171 we make iterations such that in each iteration the gauge field @xmath172 and the terms @xmath173 , @xmath174 in equation and the terms @xmath175 , @xmath176 in equation ( but not the terms with spatial derivatives in both equations ) are calculated using the data obtained in the previous iteration according to the scheme presented in @xcite ( for the first iteration , we use the data from the previous time step for the time derivatives @xmath173 in and @xmath177 , @xmath178 in ) . then , these terms are considered as the coefficients depending only on the spatial coordinate @xmath179 , so",
    "formally we solve the linear equations of motion ( homogeneous for the scalar field @xmath3 and inhomogeneous for the gauge field @xmath172 ) using the implicit crank - nicolson scheme .",
    "after each iteration , we get more accurate results for the fields and more accurate values of the corresponding terms in the equations of motion , which are used for the next iteration .",
    "we find that three iterations are enough to achieve the accuracy of the solution which is better than the accuracy of the discretization .",
    "since the scheme is implicit , it is stable with respect to von neumann stability analysis for more than two iterations @xcite .",
