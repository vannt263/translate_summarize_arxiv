    "<S> we present a new cosmological model that mimics the lambda cold dark matter by using a stealth field . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of field is characterized as not coupling directly to gravity ; however , it is connected to the underlying matter content of the universe model . </S>",
    "<S> as is known , stealth fields do not back - react on the space - time ; however , their mimicry skills show how this field and its self - interaction potential determines the cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show the study of the simplest model that can be developed with the stealth field .    _ </S>",
    "<S> i. introduction_. precise astronomical measurements of the universe indicate that nearly @xmath0 of its content is in the form of dark matter ( dm ) , the key ingredient necessary to explain large scale structure formation , and @xmath1 dark energy ( de ) , the unknown component driving the recent cosmic acceleration . in this context , the best model to describe almost all </S>",
    "<S> the observational data is a mixture of elements from the standard cosmological model plus a cosmological constant , the so - called `` concordance '' @xmath2cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> although successful in fitting the observational data , from a theoretical point of view the model seems too arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is no clue about where this cosmological constant came from , and with it , why its value is so close to the critical energy density , and second , why we live in a very special epoch where the contributions from dm and de are of the same order of magnitude , the well - known `` cosmic coincidence problem '' ( ccp ) .    </S>",
    "<S> physicists have proposed different ways to overcome this dilemma . </S>",
    "<S> the first was to adopt a dynamical cosmological constant , trying to adjust the dynamics of it to alleviate the ccp . </S>",
    "<S> this is the idea behind quintessence @xcite , where a scalar field is responsible for driving the current cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the second was to modify the left - hand side of einstein s equations , trying to explain the presence of a cosmological constant as a non - standard geometric effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the third was to violate the copernican principle , i.e. , by assuming we live in an inhomogeneous universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although some successes have been obtained in each one of these alternatives scenarios , there is so far no clear evidence of a preference compared to the @xmath2cdm model .    </S>",
    "<S> since einstein s field equations link the geometric properties of the universe with its total content , there is a well - known degeneracy between these two components ; dm and de . </S>",
    "<S> this is in fact one good reason to consider unified dark models . </S>",
    "<S> of course the _ simplicity _ of considering a single component acting as both dm and de is also a good reason . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we show that a new class of scalar field model that exhibits a non - trivial response to geometry , dubbed _ stealth _ , which serves as a unified model of the dark sector . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of considering unified scalar field models ( see @xcite for a review ) to describe dm and de emerges as a natural way to alleviate the so - called `` coincidence problem '' , namely , to explain why the energy densities of these two dark components are of the same order of magnitude today . </S>",
    "<S> models of this type have been proposed in the past , assuming the stress energy tensor of the scalar field back - react to the geometry according to einstein s equations . among them </S>",
    "<S> we can mention the model of @xcite ; where a potential @xmath3 is considered , the chaplygin gas @xcite , the generalized chaplygin gas model @xcite , and models with a non - canonical kinetic term called k - essence models @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that in the general theory of relativity gravity is understood as a manifestation of the curvature of space - time and the latter is caused by the presence of matter . </S>",
    "<S> this fundamental principle is codified in the equations proposed by einstein . </S>",
    "<S> so the slightest presence of matter on the right hand side of einstein s equations is sufficient to alter the geometry of space - time . </S>",
    "<S> however , the stealth is a kind of matter that remains present in the space - time without altering or changing its geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the stealth appears only for a scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity , and its origins date back to the improved energy - momentum tensor considered first in @xcite , where the authors showed the possibility of this new tensor becoming the source of the gravitational field ; meanwhile , the dynamic of the scalar field is dictated by the klein - gordon equation .    </S>",
    "<S> the original proposal of the stealth was reported for a three - dimensional btz black hole in @xcite , in higher dimensions in minkowski space - time @xcite and ( anti-)de sitter [ ( a)ds ] space @xcite . also in lifshitz space - time in @xcite , for a four dimensional black hole @xcite , for an ads black hole in lovelock gravity @xcite , in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity for topological black hole @xcite , for a rotating ads black hole in new massive gravity @xcite , and finally for a btz rotating black hole present two solutions in @xcite . lately , as was shown in @xcite , there are stealth fields during the cosmological evolution and some cosmological solutions are given in order to have a lcdm cosmology , in particular those with polynomials and power - law evolution are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> also , the general solutions for de sitter cosmologies and inhomogeneous stealths have been studied , concluding that only for de sitter backgrounds allow a full dependence on the space - time coordinates . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the case of a cosmological model coming from a non - minimal coupling with a stealth scalar field as a unified component describing both dm and de , and thus mimicking the @xmath2cdm model . _ </S>",
    "<S> ii . </S>",
    "<S> stealths as a unified dark model_.    in the present work we study a cosmological model coming from a non - minimal coupling with a stealth scalar field , described by the action : @xmath4.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 is the lagrangian matter . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for @xmath6 the scalar field stress tensor reduces to the usual case of a minimally coupled field . by varying the action ( [ action ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the field equations are written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the stress energy tensor of matter , and @xmath9 is the stress energy tensor of the stealth field @xmath10 given by @xmath11 it is worth noting that for @xmath12 , the variation on @xmath13 produces the stealth stress tensor @xmath9 to get a contribution from the einstein tensor .    </S>",
    "<S> the stealth configuration emerges once we set both sides of eq.([feq ] ) to zero : the left - hand side is the einstein s equation for a universe with a matter content described by @xmath8 , and the right - hand side is the stealth equations @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> once a solution to the right side is found , the stealth obeys the dynamics dictated by the space - time and at the same time it is invisible to it . while on the one hand the existence of gravitational stealth is a fact , and its feature of not having back - reaction on the gravitational field is of interest , the gravitational field equations say very little about their interaction with matter . </S>",
    "<S> there are a few works on this topic ; some remarkable results in that direction are given in @xcite , where the interaction between ordinary matter and stealth is shown and @xcite , where a relation with the axionic field is shown . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is possible to show the ability of the stealth fields to mimic any kind of matter , which is another surprising characteristic of these fields @xcite . as was demonstrated in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> there is a stealth solution in the context of a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time . </S>",
    "<S> now we obtain our cosmological model by coupling @xmath15,\\ ] ] to a perfect fluid with zero pressure , i.e. , the dust case , plus a cosmological constant , and when the scalar field depend only on time .    on the left - hand side of ( [ feq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we use the stress - energy tensor for a perfect fluid as the dm contribution , leading to the usual @xmath2cdm model , where the dm density @xmath16 and the cosmological constant @xmath2 determine the cosmic evolution @xmath17 . at the same time , from the right - hand side of ( [ feq ] ) , the stealth field @xmath10 and its self interacting potential @xmath18 determines completely the cosmic evolution @xmath17 . as a consequence of this  the evolution must be the _ same _ as that of the @xmath2cdm model  the stealth here works as a unifying field simultaneously describing the effects of the action of both dm and de . </S>",
    "<S> we get : @xmath19 and @xmath20    _ iii . </S>",
    "<S> specific stealth realizations _ as is well - known , the @xmath2cdm model is so far the best fit model for a large set of astronomical observations , such as , type ia supernovae ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , growth of structure , etc . @xcite . in this setup </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant @xmath2 drives the current accelerated expansion of the universe , detected for the first time using type ia supernovae @xcite , @xcite . as we mentioned in the introduction , although the stealth field does not back - react to the geometry , the existence of a non - zero coupling @xmath21 enables the stealth to appear dynamically coupled to the matter content . in this section </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the stealth field associated with this cosmological model . in order to give a complete description of the model we are presenting </S>",
    "<S> , we display the features of the @xmath2cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> the friedmann equation is @xmath22 and the stress - energy conservation equation implies @xmath23 where we have assumed explicitly an equation of state @xmath24 for the matter content ( cold dark matter ) . from equation ( [ 8 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the energy density , which evolves as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple model fits several observational probes quite well . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit parameters so far , assuming a curved frw metric , are those from the planck collaboration @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . on the other hand , from the vanishing of the stealth stress - energy tensor , eqs.([eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can read the equivalence relations between the set @xmath32 $ ] for the @xmath2cdm model , and the set @xmath33 $ ] for the stealths . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that an equivalence can be met by proposing the following relation : @xmath34 this means that the self interacting potential is related only algebraically to the cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> using this relation and after some manipulations , the equivalence is complete after we impose @xmath35 = \\kappa \\rho,\\ ] ] as well as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is an integration constant .    </S>",
    "<S> what we have obtained here is a stealth field @xmath10  given by the solution of ( [ key ] )  with self - interaction ( [ potfix ] ) that ( by construction ) _ generates _ an evolution  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17  totally indistinguishable from that obtained from the @xmath2cdm model .    </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence enables us to use cosmological observations to fix the values ( and the uncertainties ) of the model parameters . using ( [ key ] ) in the equation for @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> we get for the hubble function : @xmath39 before testing the model , we have to write it in terms of the redshift @xmath40 . recalling that @xmath41 the relation ( [ key ] ) can be written as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . on the other hand , eq.([heq ] ) can be written as @xmath47 the free parameters to constrain are clearly @xmath21 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no way to constrain @xmath49 based on sets ( [ phiz ] ) and ( [ heq2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we test the model using @xmath50 measurements , we can get a number for @xmath49 just by minimizing the residuals of @xmath51.\\ ] ] in practice we solve differential equation ( [ phiz ] ) numerically with the initial condition @xmath52 , and by making use of ( [ heq2 ] ) to get @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we compute the residuals . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we use observational measurements of @xmath50 extracted from @xcite  consisting of 30 data points  to constrain the free parameters in the model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we must also consider the parameters associated with the stealth potential @xmath18 . given our choice of ( [ potfix ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the potential can be described by just one parameter that is fixed by relation ( [ potfix ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by writing @xmath54 , from ( [ potfix ] ) we find that @xmath55 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , it is not necessary to fit it along with the other three , because it depends on the best fit value of @xmath21 , @xmath49 and should be consistent with the known value of @xmath56 . along these lines , it is clear that our stealth have more free parameters than the original @xmath2cdm model ( the former has four and the latter three ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we just mentioned , the only free parameters that we can fix using ( [ phiz ] ) and ( [ heq2 ] ) are @xmath21 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . after the fit ( assuming the plus sign in @xmath57 ) , we get @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in fig.([pdfz ] ) we show the @xmath61 and @xmath62 c.l . among the free parameters . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fith ] ) we display the data points used to constrain the model along with the best theoretical curve .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the reduced hubble parameter ( @xmath63 ) is the most sensitive parameter in the fit . as we mentioned in the last paragraph </S>",
    "<S> , this parameter essentially controls the amplitude of the theoretical curve displayed in fig.([fith ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast parameters @xmath48 and @xmath21 are not very sensitive to changes , so it was very difficult to find a best fit set based on the @xmath50 data . </S>",
    "<S> a close study of the system of eqs.([phiz ] ) and ( [ heq2 ] ) enables us to understand this behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the use of observational data for each value of @xmath53  instead of using an analytical expression for it  renders these two parameters highly correlated .     </S>",
    "<S> measurements obtained from @xcite . , width=302 ]    _ iv . conclusions _    in this paper we have shown an example of how the stealth can operate during the cosmological evolution describing the @xmath2cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> this example make use of an explicit quadratic potential for the stealth , and opens the possibility of extends this finding using other forms of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also re - write the stealth equations in a way to find explicitly the equivalence between the @xmath2cdm content  non - relativistic matter and a cosmological constant  and the stealth field and its potential . </S>",
    "<S> it was through this philosophy  working with the stealth equivalent of the @xmath2cdm  that we have found the example we studied .    to put our model to the test , considering the special features of the current cosmological model </S>",
    "<S> , we opt not to use an ansatz for the scale factor @xmath17 ; instead , we make use of observational data directly to constrain the free parameters of the stealth . </S>",
    "<S> what we have shown here is the _ observationally _ induced stealth that best describes the @xmath2cdm model . here </S>",
    "<S> , the stealth field with its self - interacting potential enables us to describe both the dark matter and the cosmological constant contributions , thus being a unified scalar field model . the best fit curve  </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the function @xmath53 extracted from ( [ heq2 ] )  together with the data is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fith ] ) , showing the capacity of the stealth to describe the observational data directly .    </S>",
    "<S> although by construction the stealth mimics the evolution of the @xmath2cdm model , we have performed a direct test of the model against observational data , and we have found that in this case the best fit modifies the value for @xmath48 ( instead of the typical @xmath64 , by our value @xmath65 ) at the expense of fixing an extra parameter , @xmath21 , which is absent in the @xmath2cdm model .    finally , we would like to emphasize the importance of understanding the potential role the stealth may play in cosmic evolution . as we have shown , </S>",
    "<S> although stealth does not back - react to the space - time , it can describe both dark contributions at once , accounting for almost 95% of the matter content of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> there is no doubt that we must continue to explore the consequences of the stealth in the recent cosmic evolution as well as in the early ages of the universe . </S>"
