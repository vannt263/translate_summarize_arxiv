    "in 2012 , a higgs boson was discovered at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "its observed properties are consistent with the prediction in the standard model ( sm ) within the current experimental uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "in addition , so far , no report has been delivered to us for discovery of the other new particles .",
    "therefore , it has been found that the sm is a good description for particle physics at the scale of hundred gev , not only in the gauge interactions but also in the sector of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "although the higgs boson has been discovered and its property has turned out to be sm - like , we know nothing about the structure of the higgs sector . in fact , the minimal higgs sector with one isospin doublet scalar field is just an assumption without any theoretical principle .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider a possibility that the higgs sector takes a non - minimal form with additional isospin multiplet scalar fields , such as extra singlet , doublet , triplet and so on .",
    "most of these non - minimal higgs sectors can explain current experimental data as well .",
    "furthermore , these extended higgs sectors are often introduced in the context of new physics models which try to explain the phenomena beyond the sm ; i.e. , neutrino masses , dark matter , and baryogenesis .",
    "therefore , it is very important to experimentally explore the possibility of extended higgs sectors .",
    "we then may be able to discriminate new physics models from the property of the higgs sector .",
    "for example , extended higgs sectors with multi - doublet scalar fields are introduced in supersymmetric extensions of the sm .",
    "they are also motivated to introduce an additional source of cp violation  @xcite , and to realize the strong 1st - order phase transition  @xcite , both of which are required to have successful electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "singlet scalar fields are often introduced in models with the spontaneously broken @xmath4 gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector with a complex triplet scalar field appears in models that can explain neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "tiny neutrino masses can also be explained via the loop - induced effects of extended scalar sectors  @xcite .",
    "extended scalar sectors with a discrete symmetry such as @xmath5 can provide a candidate of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "we here focus on the higgs triplet model ( htm )  @xcite .",
    "its higgs sector is composed of an isospin doublet higgs field with a hypercharge as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electric charge and @xmath8 is the third component of the isospin . ]",
    "@xmath9 and an isospin triplet higgs field with @xmath10 . in this model ,",
    "majorana masses of neutrinos are generated via new yukawa interactions among the left - handed lepton doublets and the higgs triplet field ; @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet field , and @xmath13 is a matrix in the lagrangian for the yukawa interactions .",
    "one of the most characteristic features of the htm is the existence of doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath0 , in addition to the other additional higgs bosons ; i.e. , singly - charged @xmath14 , cp - even @xmath15 and cp - odd @xmath16 higgs bosons .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0 at collider experiments is the direct evidence of the htm .",
    "production of these bosons at collider experiments has been studied in refs .  .",
    "for the decay of @xmath0 , there are three sources ; i.e. , the yukawa interactions with left - handed lepton doublets , electroweak gauge interactions in the gauge - gauge - scalar type , and those in the gauge - scalar - scalar type .",
    "they cause the same - sign dilepton decay @xmath17 , the same - sign diboson decay @xmath18 and the cascade decay @xmath19 , respectively decay occurs via the scalar triple couplings , if there is a large mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , such a situation is severely constrained by electroweak precision measurements  @xcite . ] .",
    "although the dominant decay mode of @xmath0 is determined by parameters in the model , the dilepton decay scenario has been considered as the most promising one for discovery  @xcite , because of its cleanness for the detection at colliders .",
    "it is also quite appealing that the structure of neutrino mass matrix can be directly tested by measuring the dileptonic branching ratios of @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath20  @xcite , because the branching ratios are predominantly determined by the neutrino yukawa couplings . in this scenario ,",
    "a sharp peak in the invariant mass distribution of the same - sign dilepton is the characteristic signal of @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental searches for @xmath0 in the same - sign dilepton events have been performed at lep  @xcite , hera  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the branching ratio of @xmath0 decay into @xmath21 is 100% , the strongest lower bound on the mass of doubly - charged higgs bosons has been obtained as 459  gev at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "current bounds have also been set at around 400  gev in several benchmark points for the structure of the neutrino mass matrix  @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the direct searches for @xmath0 in the diboson decay scenario , where @xmath0 predominantly decay into same - sign w bosons , at the past , current and future collider experiments , such as lep , the lhc with 7 - 8  tev run and 13 - 14  tev run .",
    "the same - sign diboson decay scenario is equally important to the same - sign dilepton decay scenario in the htm .",
    "collider phenomenology for this decay mode has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lower limit on the mass of @xmath0 has been derived by using the same - sign dilepton events collected by atlas collaboration at the lhc with 7  tev and 4.7  fb@xmath3 data  @xcite . up to our knowledge , this is the first analysis for the constraints on @xmath0 in the diboson scenario .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to explain details of the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and to make update on the results by including the qcd correction to the production cross sections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the htm .",
    "after we define the mass eigenstates for the higgs bosons , we derive the yukawa interaction and the gauge interaction for the triplet - like higgs bosons at the tree level . in section iii , we give expressions for the decay rates of @xmath0 in the all three decay modes .",
    "partial decay widths of @xmath0 are evaluated with particular attention to the case of relatively small masses where one or both of the w bosons are forced off - shell .",
    "we then show the phase diagram indicating the main decay mode of @xmath0 .",
    "next , we evaluate the cross section of @xmath0 productions at the lhc in the leading order ( lo ) and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd . in section iv ,",
    "we exhibit constraints on the mass of @xmath0 in the diboson decay scenario at the lep experiments and also at the lhc . at the lep",
    "i experiment , the lower limit on the mass of @xmath0 can be obtained from the total width of the z boson .",
    "we also evaluate the expected number of events for the various final states in the process of @xmath22 at the lep  ii experiment .",
    "we then discuss the mass bound on @xmath0 by using the current lhc limit on the cross section for anomalous production of same - sign dileptons .",
    "section v is devoted to our conclusion . in appendix ,",
    "the cross sections for @xmath0 production at the lhc with various collision energies are collected for reader s convenience .",
    "the scalar sector of the htm is composed of the isospin doublet field @xmath23 with hypercharge @xmath9 and the triplet field @xmath24 with @xmath10 . the most general form of the higgs potential under the gauge symmetry is written as @xmath25\\notag\\\\ & + \\lambda_1(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi)^2 + \\lambda_2\\left[\\text{tr}(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta)\\right]^2 + \\lambda_3\\text{tr}\\left[(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta)^2\\right ] + \\lambda_4(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi)\\text{tr}(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta ) + \\lambda_5\\phi^\\dagger\\delta\\delta^\\dagger\\phi ,   \\label{pot_htm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all the parameters are taken to be real without loss of generality  @xcite .",

    "since the experimental value of the rho parameter is close to unity ; i.e. , @xmath35  @xcite , @xmath12 has to be less than about 3.5  gev at the 95% confidence level  ( cl ) .",
    "mass eigenstates in the doubly - charged states ( @xmath0 ) purely come from @xmath24 ; i.e. , @xmath36 . for the other scalar bosons ,",

    "<S> a direct search for doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath0 is one of the most important probe in the higgs triplet model , which is motivated by generation mechanisms of tiny neutrino masses . </S>",
