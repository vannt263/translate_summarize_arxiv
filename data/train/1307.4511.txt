    "conformation of a spread - out bragg peak ( sobp ) to a tumor is the essence of radiotherapy with proton and ion beams . in a conventional broad - beam system ,",
    "the conformation is achieved with a range compensator.@xcite in national institute of radiological sciences ( nirs ) and some other facilities,@xcite high - density polyethylene ( pe ) has been used for the material of carbon - ion range compensators.@xcite recently , it was revealed that range shifting with pe would cause extra attenuation of carbon ions by 0.45%/cm as compared to water.@xcite its effect to dose , which may be hopefully moderated by secondary - particle contribution , has been long ignored in treatment planning and delivery . in the mean time , it is rather urgent to assess its clinical influence , which is the purpose of this study .    in the standard dosimetry ,",
    "dosimetric difference of medium from water is accounted to fluence correction factor , which is the ratio of dose in water to dose - to - water in the medium , to be determined for specific beams and materials by experiment or monte carlo simulation.@xcite inconveniently , clinical carbon - ion beams are specific to facilities with a wide variety of energies and modulations .",
    "in addition , relative biological effectiveness ( rbe ) varies with depth differently in these beams .",
    "these complexities would naturally demand radical simplification in physical and biological modeling of the pe effect for clinical dose evaluation .",
    "for conventional carbon - ion radiotherapy in nirs , carbon ions are accelerated and extracted from heavy ion medical accelerator in chiba ( himac ) at an energy per nucleon of @xmath0 , 350 , 400 , or 430 mev . a beam - wobbling system composed of a pair of electromagnets and a variable scatterer forms a uniform field of 10 , 15 , or 20 cm in diameter .",
    "one of 13 exchangeable ridge filters forms a sobp of modulation width from 2 to 15 cm in water and a range shifter fills the range gaps between the energies.@xcite scattering perturbation induced by the range modulation and shifting necessitates adaptation of the wobbling condition to retain sufficient field uniformity .",
    "there are currently about 500 clinical carbon - ion beams that can be delivered to patients with field and range customization .    for treatment planning ,",
    "carbon - ion beam data including relative dose @xmath1 and rbe @xmath2 as a function of depth @xmath3 in water were prepared for all combinations of energies and modulations , in which mixing of carbon ions and a wide spectrum of secondary particles was addressed by monte carlo simulation integrated with radiobiology models.@xcite    for a conformal carbon - ion beam , the tumor depth may be represented by mid - sobp depth @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the unmodulated beam range and @xmath6 is the modulation width in water . because depth - dependent analysis may be beyond the intended influence assessment , we simply evaluate doses and rbes at the mid - sobp depth , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , unless noted otherwise .",
    "we model a carbon - ion radiation as a mixture of primary carbon ions and secondary particles , in which the mid - sobp dose is decomposed into respective contributions : @xmath9 for pe range shift @xmath10 , carbon - ion dose @xmath11 will decrease due to extra attenuation of the carbon ions . in the exponential attenuation",
    "model,@xcite the carbon - ion dose will decrease by factor @xmath12 where relative carbon - ion attenuation coefficient @xmath13 was evaluated with the double ratio of nuclear cross section to stopping power for pe to water , @xmath14 , and the carbon - ion attenuation length in water , @xmath15 cm.@xcite    the production of secondary particles will increase inversely with the reduction of the carbon ions , which may also apply to the dose in the first - order approximation .",
    "secondary - particle dose @xmath16 will thus increase by factor @xmath17 for pe range shift @xmath10 .",
    "we define fluence output factor @xmath18 as the dose ratio between with and without pe insertion . in the two - component model",
    ", it is formulated as @xmath19 for pe range shift @xmath20 cm , where @xmath21 is the fluence attenuation coefficient given by @xmath22      the rbe clinically used in nirs was originally defined for an in vitro endpoint , survival fraction @xmath23 for human salivary gland ( hsg ) cells,@xcite as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the linear and quadratic dose coefficients of the hsg - cell survival response for the radiation of interest and @xmath27 is the reference photon dose for the endpoint . in clinical practice ,",
    "carbon - ion radiotherapy doses are prescribed in rbe - weighed dose with extra scaling typically by factor 1.44 to accommodate to historical treatment protocols.@xcite    in the lesion - additivity model,@xcite the rbe of the two - component radiation is given by dose - weighted average @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the rbes for the primary carbon ions and for the secondary particles .",
    "we define rbe output factor @xmath31 as the rbe ratio between with and without pe insertion , @xmath32 which modifies the rbe with pe range shift @xmath10 .",
    "the rbe - weighted dose will be modified by the fluence and rbe output factors or by clinical output factor @xmath33 for pe range shift @xmath20 cm , where @xmath34 is the clinical attenuation coefficient given by @xmath35      in clinical practice , a set of ridge filters are used for a variety of energies . among the energies , while primary - to - secondary rbe ratio @xmath36 may be reasonably constant , dose ratio @xmath37 will vary . due to nuclear interactions ,",
    "carbon - ion dose @xmath11 decreases exponentially with beam range and secondary - particle dose @xmath16 increases inversely in the first - order approximation .",
    "the dose ratio is thus an approximate function of beam range @xmath5 for each modulation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the beam range and dose ratio for reference energy @xmath41 .    for energies",
    "@xmath42 290 , 350 , 400 , and 430 mev , the beam ranges were estimated to be @xmath43 16.3 , 22.2 , 27.6 , and 31.0 cm , respectively , using approximate range  energy relation:@xcite",

    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the depth  dose and depth  rbe curves designed for a ridge filter of 6-cm modulation , for example .",
    "we assumed that the composition of the secondary particles would not severely vary in the sobp or in the base part of the tail , where primary carbon ions should be absent .",
    "this leads to approximations : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where we chose tail - base depth @xmath53 to be at 3 mm deeper than the carbon - ion range .",

    "disagreement between the measured and calculated fluence attenuation coefficients was found to be about 0.1%/cm for the 290-mev beams .",
    "possible reasoning is the following . in the present model ,",
    "the relative increase of the secondary - particle dose @xmath16 was equated with the relative decrease of the carbon - ion dose @xmath11 to correct energy dependence of the dose ratio @xmath37 .",
    "that assumption ignored energy - dependent attenuation of secondary particles . in fact , the water thickness from the pe exit to the mid - sobp depth would be smaller for 290 mev than for 350 mev by about 6 cm .",
    "consequently , the @xmath16 for 290 mev would be actually larger than that expected from 350 mev , which may have moderated fluence attenuation coefficients .",
    "although a similar situation should apply inversely to the 400-mev beams , no significant disagreement was found somehow , which may indicate intrinsic limitations of the two - component model .",
    "in addition , approximations @xmath69 and @xmath70 to deduce @xmath37 and @xmath36 could have been too simplistic for accurate evaluation .",
    "it was in principle possible to evaluate those parameters directly by redoing monte carlo simulation for ridge - filter design in accordance with the two - component model .",
    "however , it would be reasonable to assess the clinical influence of the pe effect that may possibly be overestimated by the simple calculation model .",
    "range compensators are usually concave - shaped with thickness less than a few centimeters in the middle of field .",
    "this implies that the decrease of clinical dose in the core part of a tumor will not be large . in the treatment - planning study ,",
    "the pe effect on tumor dose was about 1% , where two horizontal beams in the sacrum case were of 400 mev and all the other beams were of 290 mev .",
    "considering possible overestimation for the 290-mev beams , the pe effect would likely be even less in reality .",
    "in practical situation , where pe range compensators are always used , variation of the pe effect among patients may also be of the order of 1% , which is normally smaller than dose fluctuation due to limitations of field uniformity and multiple scatting in heterogeneity.@xcite in addition , the present radiobiology model is intrinsically limited in predicting clinical response in the presence of variability of radiosensitivity for dose fractionation , cell and tissue types , and individual patient , which would be much greater than 1% .",
    "we have investigated the dosimetric effect of pe range compensators on tumor dose due to their limited water equivalence in nuclear interactions . in the model calculation ,",
    "the extra carbon - ion attenuation of 0.45%/cm for pe range shift was moderated to 0.2%0.4%/cm in rbe - weighted dose for clinical carbon - ion beams .",
    "attenuation in absorbed dose was 0.1%0.3%/cm , for which the measurements and the calculations agreed with each other within 0.1%/cm . in the treatment - planning study ,",
    "extra attenuation in rbe - weighted dose was typically 1% or less with expected variation of the same order .",
    "therefore , the pe range compensators would not cause serious dose errors in clinical practice of carbon - ion radiotherapy , compared to other perturbation effects involved in treatment planning , beam delivery , and clinical response .",
