    "as geometers , we love to live , in our minds , in a geometric world . but how much of the physical world is geometry ?",
    "many mathematicians , including riemann , hamilton , clifford , tried to describe the physical reality as a geometric structure , and even pondered whether matter could actually be a geometric property of the space .",
    "the first materialization of their idea is einstein s _ general relativity _ , which establishes the connection between the matter fields and geometry , by einstein s equation @xmath1    the mathematical framework of general relativity is _ semi - riemannian _ ( or pseudo - riemannian ) geometry , which is a generalization of riemannian geometry to _ indefinite metrics_.    the predictions of general relativity",
    "were confirmed , and all the tests devised by physicists were passed successfully , proving that general relativity provides an accurate description of the world .",
    "but two big clouds seem to be a menace for this paradise :    1 .   an _ external _ one  the ( apparent ) incompatibility with _ quantum theory _ , which describes other very important properties of the matter 2 .",
    "an _ internal _ one  the occurrence of singularities .",
    "this presentation is about a research program concerning the problem of singularities , and the progress made so far .",
    "this problem comes from physics , but it is purely geometric .      a collapsing star can become a black hole - an object which bends the lightcones so that nothing , not even light , can escape . inside the black hole",
    "there is a singularity .",
    "when this was initially observed from the theoretical description of a collapsing star , it was hoped that this problem can not actually occur , and it is an artifact of the perfect spherical symmetry .",
    "but the singularity theorems show that , under very general assumptions , general relativity implies that such singularities occur with necessity ( penrose and hawking @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that the conditions leading to singularities are more general by christodoulou @xcite , and then even more general , by klainerman and rodnianski @xcite .",
    "it was stated ( @xcite ) that    _ general relativity predicts its own breakdown ! _",
    "let s take the simplest case of singularity in semi - riemannian geometry : the metric becomes degenerate .",
    "then , the inverse of the metric , @xmath2 , which is so necessary for raising indices , and contracting between covariant indices , can not be constructed .",
    "the christoffel symbol involves in its definition the inverse metric @xmath2 .",
    "the riemann curvature needs @xmath2 , because its definition involves contractions .",
    "therefore , we can not construct the levi - civita connection from the koszul formula .",
    "actually , for the case where the signature of the metric is constant , demir kupeli constructed a _",
    "koszul derivative _ , which unfortunately is not connection or covariant derivative , is not unique and is not invariant @xcite .",
    "he used a ( screen ) subbundle of the tangent bundle , which is maximal so that the restriction of the metric to this bundle is non - degenerate .",
    "he then constructed a curvature @xmath3 , depending on the connection .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 turned out to be a tensor field .",
    "to work free from the dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath3 on the screen bundle , kupeli developed a part of his results in the quotient bundle @xmath6 ( we denoted by @xmath7 the subbundle of @xmath8 made at each point @xmath9 of the degenerate vectors from @xmath10 ) .",
    "unfortunately , his result wo nt apply for our case , because we need the metric to change its signature .",
    "as we shall see , by a different approach than kupeli s , we can construct some canonically ( uniquely ) defined invariants like the covariant derivative for an important class of covariant tensors ( and differential forms ) , and the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "this approach will allow us to work also with variable signature . in the case",
    "when the signature is constant , our riemann curvature tensor turns out to be just kupeli s @xmath4 .",
    "we now proceed to an introduction in singular semi - riemannian geometry , and our contribution which is intended to help solving the problems of singularities in general relativity . except for the first section ,",

    "they make the quantity involved in einstein s equation become infinite .",
    "2 .   they seem to block the time evolution , because the cauchy data is partially lost in the singularities",
    ".    therefore , the information seems to no longer be preserved , leading to the _ black hole information paradox _ @xcite .",
    "the problem of singular quantities involved in the evolution equations can be approached by a method used by einstein and rosen @xcite ( for which they credited mayer ) .",
    "they suggested to multiply the riemann and the ricci tensors by a power of @xmath116 , so that all occurrences of @xmath2 in the expression of the ricci and scalar curvatures are replaced by the adjugate matrix of @xmath117 , @xmath118 ( @xcite , p. 74 ) .",
    "another possibility is to use other appropriate quantities to multiply with .",
    "for example , consider the kerr - newman solution of einstein s equations expressed in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xcite , p. 313 :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 is the electric charge , @xmath123 the angular momentum , @xmath12 the mass .",

    "of course , if we would want to solve for the geometry ( _ e.g. _ for the metric ) , we will still obtain infinities , and we may apply the method used by einstein and rosen .    while this method may work in replacing the singular data with smooth values , from geometric viewpoint one would be happier with an invariant theory which allows us to deal properly with such singularities , by relying on smooth fields .",
    "our development of singular semi - riemannian geometry for metric with variable signature presented in the earlier sections makes some steps in this direction , but for the important singularities in general relativity we may need a more powerful tool .",
    "this is because the singularities of interest for relativity are not necessarily of degenerate type ( as we can see from equation ( [ eq_kerr_newman ] ) ) . ) . ]",
    "once the equations are repaired , we need to solve the second problem : finding the correct topology at the singular regions . here",
    "usually the things are ambiguous , because we can not tell which coordinate systems are singular at the singularities and which are not .",
    "this freedom allows us to find a nice topology , which allows us to select globally hyperbolic regions from the maximally extended spacetimes , and to find space - like foliations of these regions .",
    "we will exemplify this method on the standard black hole solutions .",
    "penrose invented a method to map the entire spacetime on a finite region of a piece of paper .",
    "he employed the spherical symmetry of some of the solutions to reduce the number of dimensions to @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "then , he applied a conformal mapping to map for example the minkowski spacetime to a diamond shaped region ( fig . [ diamond ] ) .",
    "very often we represent only half of the diagram , corresponding to @xmath128 .",
    "similar mappings work for other solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "when penrose s coordinates are used , they may reveal that the spacetime can be analytically extended .",
    "figure [ std - schwarzschild ] shows the maximally extended schwarzschild solution , in penrose coordinates .",
    "it seems to imply that the black hole is paired with a white hole , in the past .",
    "sometimes , the analytical continuation leads to an infinite chain of universes similar to ours .",
    "this is the case with the penrose - carter diagram of the electrically charged ( reissner - nordstrm ) black holes ( fig .",
    "[ std - rn ] ) .",
    "the penrose - carter diagrams which describe kerr ( rotating ) black holes are very similar to those for the reissner - nordstrm black holes , except that the symmetry is now axial , and at @xmath129 there is analytical continuation to negative values for @xmath126",
    ".    the maximally extended solution may contain _ cauchy horizons _",
    ", so if we want a good foliation of the spacetime , we need to keep only a globally hyperbolic region of it .",

    "the case of rotating black holes has many common features with the charged black holes , and the penrose - carter diagrams are very similar .",
    "but the analysis is more complicated , because it s symmetry is not spherical , only axial .",
    "the singularity is a ring , and the analytic extension through the ring leads to closed time - like curves ( time machines ) .",

    ", the black holes appear , grow , and possibly evaporate and disappear . there may be primordial black holes , which exist since the beginning of the universe , and black holes which will last until the end of the universe , but they change anyway . in order to have the precise equations of such black holes",
    ", we would need to account for all possible types of matter fields which may exist , and the dynamics would be impossible to be solved anyway .",

    "<S> we report on some advances made in the problem of singularities in general relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> first is introduced the singular semi - riemannian geometry for metrics which can change their signature ( in particular be degenerate ) . </S>",
    "<S> the standard operations like covariant contraction , covariant derivative , and constructions like the riemann curvature are usually prohibited by the fact that the metric is not invertible . </S>",
    "<S> the things become even worse at the points where the signature changes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that we can still do many of these operations , in a different framework which we propose . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the writing of an equivalent form of einstein s equation , which works for degenerate metric too .    </S>",
    "<S> once we make the singularities manageable from mathematical viewpoint , we can extend analytically the black hole solutions and then choose from the maximal extensions globally hyperbolic regions . </S>",
    "<S> then we find space - like foliations for these regions , with the implication that the initial data can be preserved in reasonable situations . </S>",
    "<S> we propose qualitative models of non - primordial and/or evaporating black holes .    </S>",
    "<S> we supplement the material with a brief note reporting on progress made since this talk was given , which shows that we can analytically extend the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm metrics at and beyond the singularities , and the singularities can be made degenerate and handled with the mathematical apparatus we developed .    </S>",
