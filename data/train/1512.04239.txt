    "anais project aims at the study of the annual modulation signal attributed to galactic dark matter particles@xcite with nai(tl ) detectors at the canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc ) , in spain . for many years",
    "the dama / libra experiment , at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso , in italy , has reported the presence of an annual modulation in the detection rate compatible with that expected for a dark matter signal with a very high statistical significance@xcite .",
    "other very sensitive experiments have put stringent limits on the dark matter particles properties , constraining the compatibility scenarios , but comparison is model - dependent .",
    "anais , using the same target than dama / libra , would enable a model independent test of the dama / libra signal . to achieve this goal , anais plans to install 112.5 kg of nai(tl ) detectors at lsc along 2016 in a 3x3 modules configuration .",
    "several prototypes have been operating at the lsc in the last years@xcite , enabling a robust knowledge of the detector performance and background contributions@xcite . in the following",
    ", it will be reported on the main results derived from the anais-25 and anais-37 set - ups : firstly , we will briefly describe the experimental set - up ( section[sec : setup ] ) ; then , it will be highlighted the excellent light collection and triggering at very low energy ( section[sec : detperformance ] ) ; the filtering of photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) events and other anomalous scintillation ( section[sec : filtering ] ) ; and the remarkable background understanding ( section[sec : bck ] ) . finally , prospects for the experiment will be revised ( section[sec : prospects ] ) .",
    "the anais-25 set - up consisted of two cylindrical 12.5 kg mass nai(tl ) crystals grown by alpha spectra ( as ) , and housed in ofhc ( oxygen - free high thermal conductivity ) copper with two synthetic quartz windows allowing for the coupling of the pmts in a second step at the lsc clean room .",
    "we will refer to both modules as d0 and d1 in the following . an aluminized mylar window allowed for calibration at very low energy .",
    "hamamatsu r12669sel2 pmts have been used in most of the results presented in this paper . shielding consisted of 10 cm archaeological lead , 20 cm low activity lead , pvc box tightly closed and continuously flushed with",
    "boil - off nitrogen gas , and active plastic scintillator vetoes placed on top of the shielding .",
    "the anais-37 set - up refers to the enlargment of anais-25 in order to include a new improved module ( d2 ) , 12.5 kg mass , placed in between d0 and d1 .",
    "same pmt model and shielding described above were used ( see figure  [ fig : anais-37 ] ) .",
    "total light collected per unit of energy deposited in different nai(tl ) crystals ( see table  [ tab : yield ] ) has been calculated with the mean pulse area of events corresponding to 22.6kev from a @xmath0cd source and the mean pulse area of single photoelectrons ( phe ) , identified in pulses with a few number of them and averaged to build the single electron response ( ser ) .",
    "an excellent light yield in all the as modules can be reported , pointing at the possibility of further reduction of the anais threshold , already demonstrated to be at 2kevee level in the anais-0 prototype@xcite , consisting of a saint - gobain crystal , 9.6 kg mass , similar to those used by dama - libra .",
    "@lll@ pmt model & nai(tl ) crystal & light collected + & & ( phe / kev ) + ham r12669sel2 / ham r11065sel & anais-0 & @xmath1 / @xmath2 + ham r12669sel2 & d0 & @xmath3 + ham r12669sel2 / ham r11065sel & d1 & @xmath4 / @xmath5 + ham r12669sel2 & d2 & @xmath6 +    [ tab : yield ]    triggering is done at phe level in both pmts in and logical mode ( 200ns window ) for every module and in or logical mode between modules .",
    "energy is estimated through the area of the digitized pulse ( 1.25@xmath7s window at 2gs / s sampling rate ) .",
    "triggering has been checked to be effectively done down to 1kevee by looking at the coincidences between high energy gammas of @xmath8k and @xmath9na in one detector and very low energy depositions in a second one , at 3.2 and 0.9kevee , respectively ( see figure[fig : trigger ] ) .",
    "both lines are used for energy calibration of the detectors combined with periodic external calibrations using a @xmath0cd source .",
    "very strong tools to discriminate scintillation events stemming from the nai(tl ) bulk crystal from other kind of spurious events , having mainly the origin in the pmts , are being developed .",
    "background below 10kevee in nai(tl ) detectors is strongly dominated by them .",
    "anais applies filtering protocols and evaluates the corresponding acceptance efficiencies by studying populations of events at very low energy attributable to bulk nai(tl ) scintillation , both , from @xmath8k and @xmath9na identified coincidence events , and @xmath0cd calibration events .",
    "we have checked that very few of those anomalous events are passing the filtering by measuring with a blank module ( without crystal ) and applying the same data analysis procedures .",
    "low energy background spectra for d0 , d1 and d2 modules , after filtering and correcting by the corresponding efficiency , are shown in figure[fig : bkgle ]",
    ". however , our efficiencies for acceptance of bulk events seem to be underestimated between 1 and 2kevee and we are working on a better estimate .",
    "a successful background model was developed for anais-0 prototype@xcite , serving as starting point for the building of the background model of the as modules .",
    "main issues affecting backgrounds in the dark matter region of interest ( roi ) in previous prototypes were the internal contaminations in potassium and @xmath10pb .",
    "the main goal of the anais-25 set - up was to determine the potassium content of d0 and d1 modules .",
    "for that , the study of the coincidences between the two modules was used and a result for the @xmath8k activity of 1.25@xmath110.11mbq / kg ( equivalent to 41.7@xmath113.7ppb natural potassium ) , one order of magnitude smaller than that of anais-0 , was derived @xcite .",
    "results of anais-37 set - up have provided more information on the @xmath10pb and potassium content of d0 , d1 and d2 modules ( see table  [ tab : contaminants ] ) and very promising upper limits on @xmath12u and @xmath13th levels , being work still in progress .",
    "@lll@ isotope & nai(tl ) module & activity + & & ( mbq / kg ) + & d0 & @xmath14 + @xmath8k & d1 & @xmath15 + & d2 & @xmath16 + @xmath10pb & d0 / d1 & @xmath17 + & d2 & @xmath18 +    [ tab : contaminants ]        contaminations in the nai crystal bulk , as well as those from pmts and other detector components determined by hpge spectrometry have been included in the simulation using geant4 package and following a similar approach to that presented in@xcite . in particular , in the crystal bulk",
    "have been simulated : @xmath8k , @xmath10pb , cosmogenic isotopes of short lifetime as well as @xmath19i , @xmath20h , and the isotopes from the @xmath12u and @xmath13th chains at the level of previous prototypes .",
    "figure[fig : bkgsim ] shows a preliminary estimate of the different background contributions up to 100kevee in d2 .",
    "although cosmogenically activated isotopes contribution@xcite can be clearly identified in d2 data ( see figure[fig : bkgle ] ) because it is still decaying , the background level at low energy has significantly improved with respect to previous detectors and further improvement is expected in next prototype ( d3 ) , presently under construction at as . moreover ,",
    "a large rejection of the @xmath8k contribution in the roi could be achieved by vetoing those events by the detection of the associated high energy gamma in a liquid scintillator surrounding the detectors .",
    "we are working in the evaluation of the possibilities of such a system and its feasibility in the context of the anais project .",
    "discovery potential of anais3x3 is high , as shown in figure[fig : prospects ] , even in a very conservative background scenario : assuming 100 kg of nai(tl ) , 5years of data taking and the background already achieved , 90%c.l .",
    "positive signal in 90% of the carried out experiments would be obtained for most of the dama - libra singled - out dark matter parameter space@xcite .",
