    "since the early beginnings of quantum mechanics , the problem of particle propagation in classical forbidden regions has been the subject of both theoretical and experimental investigations . over the years , several non - relativistic approaches based in cutoff wave initial conditions _  _ have been introduced in the literature in order to investigate the time - dependent features of wave evolution in evanescent media .",
    "some of these theoretical models were inspired in the pioneering work of sommerfeld and brillouin @xcite , while others @xcite were based in the seminal work of moshinsky @xcite , who a few decades ago started a fundamental discussion on the non - relativistic and relativistic transient effects .",
    "these models represent important steps towards the clarification of the dynamics in classical forbidden regions , and a renewed motivation to explore this problem has been recently stimulated by the issue of superluminal velocities in photon @xcite and microwave @xcite tunneling .",
    "hence , it is clear that a full relativistic approach to describe the wave evolution in evanescent media is needed .",
    "nevertheless , this has become a complex problem due to the lack of exact analytical solutions to relativistic wave equations with appropriate initial conditions . among the few works in the field ,",
    "deutch and low @xcite have provided a lucid description of barrier penetration of an initial state given by a cutoff gaussian wavepacket , based on a one - dimensional klein - gordon equation .",
    "although no exact relativistic solutions were obtained , the issues of einstein causality and superluminal phenomena were rigorously discussed using approximate solutions .    in this paper we consider a model based on the klein - gordon equation , as in the work of deutch and low @xcite , for a potential step barrier and cutoff plane wave initial conditions .",
    "we obtain an exact analytic solution to the problem along the potential region and study the main features of wave evolution , in particular the regime of transient effects at early times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the shutter problem , and present the analytical derivation for the solution to a relativistic wave equation for a step potential barrier .",
    "section 3 deals with a numerical example for the solution along the internal region of the potential , and the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present the summary and conclusions .",
    "to investigate the time evolution of cutoff plane wave in a classical forbidden region , let us consider a classical field @xmath3 satisfying a one - dimensional klein - gordon equation with a variable potential @xmath4 , as in the model of deutch and low @xcite ,    @xmath5    in our case , @xmath6 is given by a step potential barrier ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , and the initial condition at @xmath9 corresponds to a plane wave shutter @xcite ( see figure [ fshutter ] ) , given by ,    @xmath10    the simplicity of our quasi - monochromatic initial state ( [ conref ] ) , allows a closed analytical solution of the problem .",
    "it differs from that of reference @xcite , where a cutoff gaussian wavepacket initial condition was considered .",
    "note that condition ( [ conref ] ) comes from the fact that for @xmath11 , the solution for the left side of the shutter @xcite is given by @xmath12-{\\rm exp}% [ -ik_r(x+ct)]$ ] , for @xmath13 , and zero for @xmath14 .    to obtain the solution for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we shall proceed along the same lines as in our recent work @xcite .",
    "we begin by laplace transforming the equation ( [ step ] ) using the standard definition    @xmath16    with the initial condition given by equation ( [ conref ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "one gets a pair of differential equations corresponding to the regions @xmath14 and @xmath13 . in order to obtain the transmitted wave function",
    ", one must consider the matching conditions for the wave function and its derivative at @xmath17 .",
    "the laplace transformed solution reads ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 corresponds to the relativistic energy @xmath21 given in reciprocal units of length .",
    "the time dependent solution for @xmath14 is readily obtained by performing the inverse laplace transform of equation  ( [ steplap ] ) using the bromwich integral formula ,    @xmath22    where the integration path is taken along a straight line @xmath23 parallel to the imaginary axis in the complex @xmath24plane .",
    "the real parameter @xmath25 can be chosen arbitrarily as long as all singularities remain to the left - hand side of @xmath26 .",
    "the integral ( [ bromwich1 ] ) expressed in this form , is difficult to manipulate since the integrand ( [ steplap ] ) has branch points at @xmath27 . to surmount this difficulty ,",
    "let us introduce the change of variable , @xmath28 , which allows to eliminate the branch points .",
    "thus , @xmath29 , and as a consequence , the bromwich integral may be written as ,    @xmath30    where the new integrand @xmath31 is given by ,    @xmath32/2\\}.   \\label{integrand}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the branch points go into an essential singularity at @xmath33 and two simple poles @xmath34 , where we defined @xmath35 .",
    "the integration in equation ( [ brom2 ] ) is performed along a straight line @xmath36 parallel to the real axis cutting the positive imaginary axis at @xmath37 .",
    "we proceed to evaluate the above integral by considering a closed bromwich integration contour ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , and cauchy s residue theorem . for @xmath38",
    "we close the integration path @xmath36 from above , by a large semicircle @xmath39 of radius @xmath40 , forming a closed contour @xmath41 .",
    "the contribution along @xmath42 vanishes as @xmath43 , and since there are no poles enclosed inside @xmath44 @xmath45 for @xmath38 . for the case @xmath46 we close the integration path from below with a large semicircle @xmath42 .",
    "the closed contour @xmath47 contains three small circles @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 enclosing the essential singularity at @xmath33 and the simple poles at @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",

    "the contour integration for @xmath56 requires a more elaborate calculation , since involves an essential singularity at @xmath33 . for this case",
    ", we introduce the change of variable given by @xmath57 , thus the integral now becomes    @xmath58}{\\omega ^2(\\omega -\\omega _ { + } ) ( \\omega -\\omega _ { -})}d\\omega ,   \\label{c0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 . to carry out the integration ,",
    "first let us separate the integrand into partial fractions , and substitute the well known formula for the bessel generating function ,    @xmath60    and the series expansion ,    @xmath61    the resulting integrals can be evaluated by means of the residue theorem .",
    "for the case of an essential singularity , the residue may be determined by computing explicitly the coefficient corresponding to @xmath62 from the series expansion and their products . in that case ,",

    "the other parameters are defined as : @xmath69 ^{1/2},$ ] @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from equation ( [ stepfinal ] ) we see that the solution obeys einstein causality , i.e. no propagation faster than the speed of light , @xmath2 , is detected along the barrier region . in other words ,",
    "an observer located at an arbitrary position @xmath72 inside the barrier must wait a time @xmath73 before detecting the arrival of the signal .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us now consider the asymptotic behavior of @xmath74 for the cases @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "from the solution we have just discussed , one may recover the free propagation solution in the limit @xmath75 .",
    "this corresponds to let the variables @xmath78 @xmath79 . to illustrate the limit process in equation ( [ stepfinal ] ) ,",
    "let us rewrite the solution by using equation ( [ relation ] ) , namely , @xmath80",

    "it can be shown that the second series also vanishes , by replacing the bessel functions by their asymptotic values for small values of the argument @xmath85 ,    @xmath86    therefore , one obtains the solution for the free propagation case ,    @xmath87    note that the free case solution rises from zero only after a time @xmath88 fulfilling relativistic causality , and then oscillates periodically thereafter .    in the case of the long - time limit @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 . from the asymptotic expansion of @xmath67 for large values of the argument @xmath85 ,    @xmath92 , \\label{aslong}\\ ] ]    and therefore @xmath93 .",
    "one can see from equation ( [ simplif ] ) that the series in @xmath94 vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "if we rewrite @xmath95 by means of equation ( [ relation ] ) , the exponential term is canceled and the remaining series vanishes .",
    "consequently , @xmath96goes into the stationary solution @xmath97 given by ,    @xmath98    the asymptotic behavior near the relativistic cutoff , is obtained when @xmath99 in equation ( [ stepfinal ] ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath100 , which allows us to substitute the asymptotic expansion ( [ bessmall ] ) in @xmath94 ( equation ( [ simplif ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the series of equation ( [ simplif ] ) goes into an exponential function , which cancels exactly with the exponential term , and as a result the solution @xmath101 goes like @xmath102 . from similar considerations on @xmath103 ,",
    "an identical expression is obtained and the approximate behavior of @xmath74 near the cutoff is given by ,    @xmath104    where for exactly the value @xmath105 , the above expression goes to zero fulfilling relativistic causality .",
    "in order to exemplify the evolution of the solution given by equation ( [ stepfinal ] ) along the evanescent region , we decided to study the properties of @xmath106 as a function of time @xmath107 and the position @xmath108 .",
    "the parameters for the system considered in all the cases for the present study are : barrier height @xmath109 @xmath110 , incidence energy @xmath111 @xmath112 ( @xmath113 @xmath110 ) .",
    "the first case corresponds to the spatial evolution of @xmath106 along the dispersive region . in figure",
    "[ birth ] we show at early times the birth of the main wavefront as a function of the position , for increasing values of time : @xmath114 @xmath115 , @xmath116 @xmath115 and @xmath117 @xmath115 .",
    "the solution rises as time goes on , and at @xmath118 , @xmath106 has already crossed over the stationary solution @xmath119 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the inset of figure [ birth ] shows the crossover of @xmath120 at later time @xmath121 @xmath115 .",
    "this behavior is relevant since it indicates that the relativistic solution fluctuates around @xmath122 , before reaching its asymptotic regime . at the inset",
    ", we can also observe how the solution evanesces within a finite depth given approximately by @xmath123 @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the _ penetration length _ of the stationary solution @xmath126 ( equation ( [ stationary ] ) ) .",
    "we find that beyond @xmath0 the solution exhibits a small maxima , corresponding to the birth of a forerunner . in figure [ earlyt1 ]",
    "we depict the spatial evolution of @xmath106 ( solid line ) for a fixed value of @xmath127 @xmath115 .",
    "as can be seen in this example , the main part of the wave rapidly evanesces in the potential region for small values of the position .",
    "however , from approximately @xmath0  onwards , the solution exhibits an oscillatory behavior before reaching the relativistic cutoff at @xmath128 @xmath124 , corresponding to the earliest arrival of the signal at a point located within the potential . the stationary solution @xmath119 ( dashed line ) is also included for comparison .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity of the oscillatory structure in figure [ earlyt1 ] , to the well known sommerfeld precursor @xcite , which is one of the essential features of wave propagation in dispersive media . despite the fact that sommerfeld s approach is quite different from ours , the similarities go beyond the numerical results .",
    "for instance , their asymptotic analysis showed that the wave function is governed by a first order bessel function near the relativistic cutoff .",
    "our analysis reproduces such behavior , which is given by equation ( [ bessel2 ] ) . for comparison , the value of the bessel function @xmath129 modulated by the prefactor @xmath130 , is also included in figure [ earlyt1 ] ( dotted line ) .",
    "note that if we define the frequency of the oscillations of the precursor in terms of the distance between successive zeros of @xmath129 , one sees from the definition of the argument @xmath85  that the value of the frequency depends only on the position @xmath108  and the potential @xmath81  that characterizes the medium i.e. the precursor frequency is independent of the incidence energy .    in figure [ earlyt2 ]",
    "we show @xmath106 ( solid line ) as a function of the position @xmath108 , at a subsequent time @xmath131 @xmath115 .",
    "we can see that the solution reaches its stationary value @xmath119 ( dashed line ) for small values of @xmath108 ; nevertheless , near the relativistic cutoff at @xmath132 @xmath124 ,  the precursor exhibits a rich oscillatory structure .",
    "the inset of figure [ earlyt2 ] illustrates the forerunner near the cutoff , and shows that the asymptotic behavior is dictated by the bessel function of equation ( [ bessel2 ] ) ( dotted line ) .",
    "up to here we have illustrated the spatial behavior of @xmath106 , and some interesting features of the time evolution . in order to fully explore the relevant features of the time evolution , in figure [ diffraction ]",
    "we plot @xmath106 as a function of time at different positions : @xmath133 @xmath124  , @xmath134 @xmath124 and @xmath135 @xmath124 . for all the curves depicted , as soon as @xmath136 the solution is different from zero along the internal region , fulfilling relativistic causality .",
    "as can be seen , the solution rises from zero at @xmath88 and grows monotonically towards a maximum value , from which it starts to oscillate thereafter , forming a pattern very similar to the diffraction in time phenomenon @xcite . *  * the concept of diffraction in time was originally introduced by moshinsky @xcite while discussing the shutter problem for the free particle schrdinger equation .",
    "he observed a time - dependent oscillatory regime of the probability density near the semiclassical wavefront that he named diffraction in time , in analogy to the well known fresnel optical diffraction .",
    "it is interesting to note the resemblance of the oscillatory pattern in figure [ diffraction ] , to the diffraction in time phenomenon observed in the free propagation case @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the low - energy regime ( @xmath137 ) the solution ( [ stepfinal ] ) can be rewritten in a more concise form by using equation ( [ relation ] ) , namely , @xmath138 ,   \\label{flommel}\\ ] ] where @xmath139  and @xmath140  are the lommel functions of two variables @xcite , widely used in connection with optical diffraction @xcite .",
    "the resemblance to diffraction phenomena suggests that there exists a more profound link ; however , the physical implications of the striking mathematical similarities found above deserves further study .",
    "it is important to mention that the transient effect depicted in figure [ diffraction ] is observed in the low - energy regime i.e. @xmath141 ; this condition is satisfied in the present example , where the effect was observed for values of the ratio *  * @xmath142*. * moreover , we only observed the phenomenon in the regime of small values of the position @xmath108 where the solution decays in the potential region i.e. @xmath143 . from values greater than @xmath144 the solution enters into a different oscillatory regime , and the diffraction - type pattern begins to disappear . in figure [ nodiff ]",
    "we illustrate the inhibition of the diffraction - type pattern for a fixed value of the position @xmath145 @xmath124 .",
    "clearly , it fades out and is replaced by a series of oscillations , which register the fast crossing of the precursor at @xmath145 @xmath124 ,  and the remaining forerunners .",
    "there is another interesting feature in the time evolution of @xmath120 that can be appreciated in figure [ peakshift ] , in which we plot @xmath106 as a function of time in the main peak region .",
    "surprisingly , the maximum peak of the wave appears on @xmath146 nm  ( dotted line ) earlier than the peak at @xmath147 nm  ( dashed line ) and @xmath148 nm(solid line ) .",
    "this relative _ time shift _ of the wave peak is an apparent violation of relativistic causality , and can be interpreted as a non - causal behavior .",
    "this comes from the fact that we are comparing the maximum wave peak at different positions .",
    "however , we observe that the wavefront always fulfills einstein causality , and no signal travels faster than @xmath2 in the dispersive region . therefore , the observed shift of the main peak may be interpreted as a reshaping of the wave and not as a genuine violation of relativity .",
    "it is interesting to mention that we have observed a similar non - causal behavior in the probability density along a classical forbidden region of a rectangular potential barrier , within a non - relativistic framework .",
    "moreover , some authors have also reported non - causal phenomena in electromagnetic evanescent modes @xcite .",
    "the possibility of describing the wave evolution from the transient to the stationary regime , offers a clear advantage over the asymptotic methods of solution available in the literature , for which the short and intermediate transient regimes are inaccessible . in what follows",
    ", we shall discuss the new features in the dynamical process of evanescent waves observed in the previous section .",
    "the buildup of @xmath149 exhibits a very interesting behavior ; the solution instead of just grow monotonically towards the stationary solution latexmath:[$%    asymptotic regime , as it is shown by the series of curves of @xmath149 versus @xmath108 at different times ( see figure [ birth ] ) . the effect of these fluctuations in a plot of @xmath149 versus @xmath107 ( @xmath108 fixed ) is manifested as a series of oscillations similar to a diffraction in time pattern , see figure [ diffraction ] .",
    "the inset of figure [ birth ] shows that beyond a certain distance , an interesting structure of the wave appears ; this is the birth of the sommerfeld - type forerunner which travels along the potential region , as illustrated in figures [ earlyt1 ] and [ earlyt2 ] ; the head of this signal propagates at the speed of light and can reproduced by the first order bessel function @xmath129 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the birth of the forerunner is an important event since its propagation at longer times becomes the dominant process ; this is also the case in the context of different relativistic and non - relativistic approaches , where the characterization of the forerunners has been recently emphasized .    at early times and for small values of the position",
    ", the main front of the wave decays exponentially along the potential . as time goes on , the dynamics is dominated by the propagation of the forerunners since the main front rapidly reaches its asymptotic value without propagation .",
    "thus , one may speak of two regimes , which as discussed in the previous section , are characterized by @xmath0  where @xmath1  is the penetration length .",
    "if we choose a position @xmath151 and wait for the main wavefront , instead of detecting its arrival we would only register the fast crossing of the precursor ( see figure [ nodiff ] ) .",
    "the absence of main wavefront propagation in the evanescent region is in agreement with a series of works @xcite , which have questioned the existence of semiclassical wavefront propagation proposed by stevens @xcite and supported by moretti @xcite .",
    "another important result of this work is the non - causal peakshift exhibited in figure [ peakshift ] .",
    "the non - causal behavior observed here is a consequence of the reshaping of the wave ; reshaping effects have also been observed in the context of wavepacket evolution within both relativistic @xcite and non - relativistic @xcite approaches .",
    "the role of this effects and the issue of non - causal behavior has been recently discussed by deutch and low @xcite for the case of gaussian wavepacket evolution in the transmitted region of a potential barrier , based on approximate solutions to the klein - gordon equation .",
    "although the barrier and the step potential are different systems , both exhibit an evanescent region ; hence , we believe that the non - causal behavior observed in reference @xcite could be related to a reshaping process occurring inside the barrier , similar to the reshaping observed in the step discussed in our model . however , in order to investigate such a reshaping inside the barrier , the solution of the klein - gordon equation is required for the internal region . in this respect",
    ", the analytical techniques used in this work may provide a suitable method of solution to tackle this fundamental problem ; nevertheless , this not an easy task since the extension of our model to the case of a barrier of finite width involves more complicated analytical properties of the solution due to the presence of resonances .",
    "we have derived an exact analytical solution to a klein - gordon equation for a step potential barrier , using a cutoff plane wave initial condition . to our knowledge , this is the first model which allows a closed solution for the description of relativistic transient effects in a classical forbidden region .",
    "the main features of the spatial and time evolution along the evanescent region can be summarized in the following points : ( i ) we found a regime where the solution is exponentially suppressed and thus , decays as a function of @xmath108 along the potential .",
    "this main part of the wave does not propagate along the structure .",
    "the regime is characterized by a region extending from @xmath17 to @xmath152 , where @xmath125 is the penetration length of the stationary solution ( [ stationary ] ) .",
    "however , from @xmath152 onwards , the solution exhibits an oscillating pattern near the relativistic cutoff , traveling at the speed of light , @xmath2 which can be identified as a sommerfeld - type precursor .",
    "also , within the finite depth @xmath153 , we found in the low - energy situation that the time evolution of @xmath154 references ----------"
