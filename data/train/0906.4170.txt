    "vesicles are fluid droplets enclosed by a fluid lipid membrane .",
    "typically , vesicles have sizes of the order of 100 nanometers to 10 micrometers , whereas the thickness of the membrane is only of the order of a nanometer .",
    "therefore , the membrane can often be regarded as a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "vesicle shapes and fluctuations are then governed by the curvature elasticity .",
    "this description has been very successful to explain vesicles behavior in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of fluid vesicles in shear flow has attracted much attention recently @xcite .",
    "aspherical vesicles under shear can be found in different dynamical phases , depending on the viscosities @xmath8 and @xmath9 of inner and outer fluids , respectively , the membrane viscosity @xmath10 , the bending rigidity @xmath11 , the shear rate @xmath12 , the membrane area , and enclosed volume .",
    "as long as shape relaxation times of the vesicle are small compared to the time scale set by the shear rate @xmath12 , the vesicle is always close to its equilibrium shape . under these conditions ,",
    "vesicles can be found either in tank - treading ( tt ) motion , or  if the viscosity contrast @xmath13 exceeds a critical value  in a tumbling ( tb ) motion . in the tank - treading regime ,",
    "the vesicle shape and orientation are stationary in time , but the membrane rotates around the vesicle s center of mass in the same direction as the rotational part of the shear flow . here , the orientation is characterized by the inclination angle @xmath14 with respect to the flow direction . in the tumbling regime ,",
    "the long axis of the vesicle performs a periodic rotation .",
    "keller and skalak @xcite developed a theory for fluid vesicles with fixed ellipsoidal shape and different viscosity contrasts , which is able to explain the observed experiments . in recent years , computer simulations @xcite have shown that the keller - skalak ( ks ) theory provides indeed a very good description of tank - treading and tumbling .",
    "however , the vesicle dynamics is far less understood when the shear rate is large enough that the vesicle can not relax into its equilibrium shape .",
    "only recently , it was shown that a third dynamical regime can appear under these conditions , the swinging ( sw ) regime @xcite  also called the trembling @xcite or vacillating - breathing regime @xcite . in the swinging state , oscillations of shape and inclination angle together",
    "determine the vesicle dynamics .",
    "swinging vesicles were first observed experimentally in ref .  @xcite . with increasing shear rate , a transition from tumbling to swinging motion was found .",
    "a perturbation theory for quasi - spherical vesicles to lowest order in the deviation from the spherical shape predicted swinging for a range of viscosity contrasts @xcite ; however , since the shear rate appears only as basic ( inverse ) time scale in this approach , the experimental results could not be explained .",
    "therefore , higher - order expansions for quasi - spherical vesicles @xcite and a generalized keller - skalak ( ks ) theory for ellipsoidal vesicles @xcite have been developed , which are able to predict phase transitions with varying shear rate and thereby to explain the experiments of ref .",

    "the dynamics in the tt , tb , and sw phases has been studied mainly for single vesicles in an unbounded fluid . however , in particular due to its physiological importance , it is of high interest to study the dynamical behavior of vesicles under shear in the presence of walls . in this case",
    ", vesicles are repelled from a wall due to a hydrodynamic lift force @xmath15 .",
    "the hydrodynamic lift force plays an important role in circulatory systems of vertebrates .",
    "since the lift force pushes red blood cells to the center of a blood vessel , where the flow velocity is largest , it increases the efficiency of oxygen transport . on the other hand ,",
    "white blood cells move along the vessel walls in order to find defects in the vascular endothelium @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by special ligands , which are located at the outside of white blood cells and bind to receptors on the vessel wall to resist the hydrodynamic lift force @xcite .",
    "the existence of a hydrodynamic lift force was first reported by poiseuille in 1836 @xcite , who observed this effect on blood cells . in recent years",
    ", the hydrodynamic lift force was studied intensively , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "abkarian et al .",
    "@xcite observed the unbinding of a heavy vesicle , which was pulled by gravity towards a wall , with increasing shear rate . for vesicles which are not in direct contact with the wall , only studies in three dimensions with equal viscosities of inside and outside fluids exist .",
    "both , boundary - integral simulations @xcite as well as theoretical studies @xcite show that the lift force decays with a power law @xmath16 with increasing distance between the vesicle s center of mass and the wall . for vesicles in two dimensions ,",
    "there are only theoretical and numerical studies which focus on adhering vesicles bound to the wall by a short - ranged attractive potential @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of a two - dimensional ( @xmath17d ) vesicle as a function of viscosity contrast @xmath18 and shear rate @xmath19 , both in the bulk and near a wall .",
    "the advantage of simulations of a vesicle in two dimensions is ( i ) the reduced numerical effort of hydrodynamics simulations , which allows for larger system sizes , longer accessible time scales , and better statistics , and ( ii ) the simpler form of the equations of the ks theory , where no integrals remain in the geometric factors  unlike in the @xmath20d version ( see app .  [ sec : ks_derivation ] ) .",
    "this facilitates a detailed comparison of the results of theory and simulations . using a mesoscopic hydrodynamics approach ,",
    "we first show that the sw mode also exists in two dimensions , and determine the dynamical phase diagram .",
    "the simulation results are compared with the predictions of a generalized ks theory .",

    "moreover , we investigate the effect of a wall on the tt - tb behavior . for comparison with the results of mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulations , we also determine @xmath15 and the inclination angle @xmath14 by the boundary - integral method for tank - treading vesicles with @xmath21 .",
    "in a @xmath17d vesicle , the perimeter @xmath22 and the enclosed area @xmath23 are kept constant ( analogously to the constant membrane surface and the enclosed volume of @xmath20d vesicles ) .",
    "it is useful to combine these two parameters into a dimensionless quantity , the reduced area @xmath24 here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the radii of circles with the same @xmath22 and @xmath23 as those of the vesicle , respectively .",
