    "the possibility that degenerate relativistic quark matter becomes a color superconductor at low temperatures has been considered for the past two decades . as the seminal papers @xcite noted , the quark - quark interaction in the color antitriplet channel is attractive and drives a cooper pairing instability in the system , even in the limit of high densities where the fermi energy of the quarks dominates over the one - gluon exchange interaction energy .",
    "work in the intervening period has concentrated on the mean field approach , strictly valid only in the weak coupling limit ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . as the density is lowered , nonperturbative effects arising from self - couplings of the gluon field prevail , finally leading to a confinement transition into hadronic matter .",
    "strong coupling effects can modify the equilibrium order parameter from the weak coupling prediction , as effects of spin fluctuation exchange do in superfluid @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "the resultant change in the color - superconducting phase can also affect the breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the properties of the color superconductivity such as the pairing gap and the critical temperature , @xmath1 , have yet to be derived in the strong coupling regime in a rigorous way .",
    "in this paper we examine color superconductors by means of a general ginzburg - landau approach , which permits us to determine the coarse grained features of such systems at temperatures just below @xmath1 , for arbitrary qcd coupling constant , @xmath2 .",
    "this approach , pioneered by anderson and brinkman @xcite and mermin and stare @xcite in the context of superfluid @xmath0he , reveals the most energetically favorable phase just below @xmath1 , in terms of the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic potential to fourth order in the pairing gap .",
    "the first application of the general ginzburg - landau theory was made by bailin and love @xcite to quark pairing with one flavor and total angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "here we shall consider more general cooper pairing between @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 quarks with @xmath7 .",
    "we complement this approach by deriving the parameters controlling the fourth order terms from the weak coupling gap equation .",
    "previous work @xcite has systematically investigated such pairing at zero temperature ; the present study provides a systematic elucidation of the equilibrium properties near @xmath8 .    the zero - temperature pairing gap and hence @xmath8 is predicted to be @xmath9 10100 mev for baryon chemical potentials @xmath9 1 gev @xcite .",
    "this prediction relies on extrapolation from weak coupling into the low density , nonperturbative regime , by incorporating into the bcs gap equations effective interactions modeled after instanton - mediated interactions , in such a way as to reproduce constituent quark masses .",
    "application of the wilson renormalization group to analysis of the stability of a fermi liquid against cooper pairing @xcite suggests that four - fermion couplings , induced between two particles with zero total momentum by one - gluon exchange or by instantons , grow logarithmically with momentum as higher modes are successively integrated out closer to the fermi surface ; the scattering amplitudes eventually reach a singularity  a landau pole  in a way dependent on the number of flavors involved in the pairing . for two flavors ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) ,",
    "both gluon and instanton - induced interactions play a role in opening an energy gap in the isoscalar , color - antitriplet channel with zero total angular momentum ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "pairing in this channel partially breaks baryon number symmetry and global color rotational invariance , but restores chiral symmetry . for three flavors ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , on the other hand , a color - flavor locked state @xcite arises in the @xmath7 channel mainly from the gluon - induced interactions when the strange quark mass is sufficiently small .",
    "this state is invariant under simultaneous exchange of color and flavor , but not under single exchange of color or flavor ; chiral symmetry as well as baryon number symmetry and global color rotational invariance are broken . in the high density regime where the interactions are dominated by one - gluon exchange , the color magnetic ( transverse ) force , which is screened only dynamically by landau damping of its mediators @xcite , is sufficiently long ranged to alter the dependence of the pairing gap on the qcd coupling constant @xmath2 from the bcs result .",
    "this fact was first noted by son @xcite using a renormalization group method and an approximate solution to the relevant gap equation .    as in prior papers ,",
    "we focus on the equilibrium properties of an ultrarelativistic color superconductor that is _ homogeneous _ , in the sense that the real gluon field vanishes everywhere and the order parameter is everywhere continuous in magnitude and orientation ; we denote such a state as _ superfluid quark matter_. such homogeneity is similar to that in superfluid @xmath0he and superfluid neutron matter , as noted by bailin and love @xcite , because in both cases breaking of the global @xmath10 gauge symmetry is accompanied by global symmetry breaking associated with the internal degrees of freedom . in superfluid",
    "quark matter , the possible order parameters are generally _ anisotropic _ in color space ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a situation analogous to superfluid @xmath0he in which , as seen experimentally , the anisotropy lies in spin space @xcite .",
    "we first restrict ourselves to the case , normally assumed in earlier investigations , in which the chemical potentials of different color and flavor quarks are equal .",
    "we obtain the thermodynamic potential difference between the superfluid and normal phases near @xmath8 from the ginzburg - landau approach .",
    "the terms of second and fourth order in the pairing gap are constrained by invariances of the grand canonical hamiltonian and by the structure of the order parameters , assumed here to be antisymmetric in color and flavor space .",
    "we then identify the degenerate sets of order parameters corresponding to local energy minima as isoscalar color - antitriplet and color - flavor locked states , and determine their condensation energies .",
    "we draw the resultant equilibrium phase diagram near @xmath8 in the space of parameters characterizing the fourth order terms .",
    "we find that in the limit of weak coupling , the isoscalar , color - antitriplet phase is less favorable than the color - flavor locked phase near @xmath8 .    in general",
    ", determination of the ginzburg - landau parameters requires inclusion of strong coupling effects . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", we anchor the general ginzburg - landau approach by deriving the parameters from the relevant weak coupling gap equations at finite temperature @xcite , including the infrared structure of the gluon propagator as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the latter behavior determines the @xmath2 dependence of the pairing gap in the weak coupling limit .",
    "debye screening of the electric gluons and landau damping of the magnetic gluons , calculated with one - gluon exchange as modified by a normal medium , provide effective infrared cutoffs of the respective scattering amplitudes .",
    "motivated by the fact that deconfined quark matter must be in an overall color singlet state , we also consider the equilibrium properties of superfluid quark matter under the condition that it is color - charge neutral . in normal",
    "quark matter , in which global color rotational invariance is ensured by qcd interactions , the constraint of color neutrality leads to equality of the chemical potentials for quarks of different colors ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "superfluid quark matter , on the other hand , generally has a preferred direction in color space . such violation of color rotational invariance together with the requirement of overall color neutrality leads to differences in the chemical potential between colors , in a way dependent on the degree of anisotropy of the order parameters in color space .",
    "this disparity in chemical potentials in turn alters the pairing gap , a feature seen in the general ginzburg - landau analysis . beyond the usual terms of second and fourth order in the pairing gap , color neutrality adds terms dependent on the chemical potential differences between colors .",
    "such extra terms , which act in the isoscalar , color - antitriplet channel , do not remove the degeneracy of the order - parameter sets occurring for equal color chemical potentials and renormalize the coefficients of the fourth order terms so as to reduce the pairing gap . in order to estimate the influence of color neutrality on the gap in the weak coupling limit , we incorporate color chemical potential differences in the gap equation , and find that in the weak coupling limit , such differences do not significantly modify the gap .",
    "although it does not affect the color - flavor - locked phase , the constraint of color neutrality can appreciably raise the free energy of the isoscalar , color - antitriplet phase in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we base our calculations in the weak coupling limit on the field - theoretical description of an ordinary superconductor as advanced by nambu @xcite and eliashberg @xcite , who reformulated the original bcs problem in terms of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "such a formalism is useful when the interactions are nonlocal in time , as are the color magnetic interactions in the relativistic plasma .",
    "this tool was generalized to a relativistic regime by others in earlier investigations ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we focus in this paper on a system in flavor equilibrium , with no chemical potential differences between flavors ( as long as the electrical charge of the quarks is neglected ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy of the superfluid is invariant under rotations of the equilibrium states in flavor space .",
    "the influence of the possible flavor chemical potential differences on the phase diagram , examined by others in earlier investigations @xcite , resolves this degeneracy .",
    "such differences may also give rise to an inhomogeneous phase in which the pairing gap varies periodically in ordinary space .",
    "the conditions determining the chemical potential differences between flavors depend , however , sensitively on the extent to which the system is out of flavor equilibrium .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of this paper . by applying general ginzburg - landau theory to the @xmath7 , color and flavor antisymmetric pairing states of superfluid quark matter",
    ", we elucidate the phase diagram near @xmath1 in the space of the parameters controlling the fourth order terms in the pairing gap .",
    "we find that the phase diagram contains an isoscalar color - antitriplet phase and a color - flavor locked phase , both reached by a second order phase transition , as well as a region of ginzburg - landau parameters for which the transition to the superfluid phase is of first order .",
    "the detailed structure of the superfluid phase in this regime depends on the nature of the sixth order terms in the expansion . in the limit of weak coupling ,",
    "the color - flavor locked phase is more favorable than the isoscalar color - antitriplet phase .",
    "we also expand the general ginzburg - landau approach and the nambu - eliashberg formalism to incorporate differences in the chemical potential between colors , required to preserve color - charge neutrality of the system .",
    "we find that the color neutrality constraint in the presence of anisotropy of the order parameters in color space tends to suppress the gap .",
    "color superconductivity in quark matter becomes an astrophysically interesting problem if neutron star interiors are sufficiently dense that they contain quark matter cores @xcite .",
    "generally , a quark superfluid in a neutron star would not be electrically neutral since each quark has fractional electric charge ; rather it would coexist with electrons ( and muons ) in such a way as to ensure electric neutrality in the system . due to the dually charged nature of the quarks , macroscopic manifestations of both color and electromagnetic superconductivity such as meissner effects , generation of london fields , and vortex formation",
