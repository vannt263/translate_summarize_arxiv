    "the hot , massive population i wolf - rayet stars are the evolved descendents of o - type stars .",
    "wr stars live on the verge of exploding as supernovae ( even hypernovae ) , thus providing vitally important information about the very final stages of massive star evolution , possibly leading to gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the extremely luminous ( @xmath0 ) and hot ( @xmath1 ) hydrostatic cores of wr stars drive fast dense winds : average mass - loss rates @xmath2 and terminal velocities @xmath3 .",
    "there are three evolutionary - successive wr phases : wn , wc ( carbon - rich , dust - producing class we are going to discuss here ) , and wo .",
    "even though present - epoch dust production output for all galactic wc stars is @xmath4 of the total galactic rate @xcite , the dust - generating wc stars are regarded as outstanding for three main reasons : ( i ) the absolute rate of dust production is extraordinarily high , reaching @xmath5 @xcite in some stars .",
    "( ii ) the dust is formed in a hot , extremely hostile environment , posing a formidable theoretical problem .",
    "( iii ) in the early ( age@xmath61 gyr ) universe , wr stars could be very common , but unique sources of dust , along with subsequent dust - generating sn events , since wr stars evolve much more rapidly than any lower - mass stars , commonly associated with dust production in the ` modern ' universe .",
    "it is not clear how much ( and what kind of ) dust can be produced in a sn explosion @xcite .",
    "however , it is quite clear that the copious amounts of the carbon - rich dust produced in the wc winds may survive for at least @xmath7 years @xcite , thus effectively reaching ( and enriching ) the ism .",
    "two basic processes of dust formation prevail among the wc stars :    \\(i ) ` single ' channel : constant , sustained formation in single wc stars , only of the coolest ( wc9,10 and some wc8 ) subtypes .",
    "the ir emission excess , arising from re - radiation of stellar uv photons by the hot dust and superposed on an underlying hotter stellar emission component , is in the form of @xmath6black - body radiation at @xmath8 from a shell with inner critical diameter @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) ( see zubko 1998 and references therein ) . presumably , the winds of hotter single wc stars are too rarified to form dust at a distance where the uv radiation has dropped sufficiently to allow dust formation to occur . in any case , even in cool wc stars , a smooth wind flow will not form dust ; clumping is required for efficient grain growth @xcite .",
    "apparently , it can not be excluded that the ` single ' channel might ultimately involve a binary companion and thus a strong wind - wind collision zone to facilitate the dust formation    \\(ii ) ` binary ' channel : episodic formation in binary wc + o systems with eccentric orbits , and almost constant dust formation in wc+o binaries with @xmath6circular orbits ( ` pinwheel nebulae ' : see @xcite ) . the key factor here is the compression by wind - wind collision involving h - rich material from the o - star and the c - rich wc wind .",
    "this allows dust formation to occur , which is dramatically enhanced at each periastron passage . among the some 7 systems in which episodic dust formation has been detected so far @xcite ,",
    "all have ( confirmed or suspected ) long periods of several years , with no preference for hot- or cool - type wc stars .",
    "presumably , the dust is formed relatively far downstream along the shock interface , where the temperature has fallen sufficiently from the initially extremely high values of @xmath11 .",
    "the shock cone wraps around the weaker - wind o - star , so that ir dust emission should arise in a preferred direction far beyond the o - star , as seen from the wr star .",
    "hot ( @xmath12 k ) circumstellar wr dust was only recently spatially resolved around some wc+o binaries @xcite .",
    "all the above - cited near - ir observations have targeted the hottest dust only .",
    "the apparent sub - arcsecond sizes of the barely resolved hot dust regions made next to impossible any direct application of quantitative models . the first mid - ir ( @xmath13 ) images of the spatially - resolved dust cloud around wr112 @xcite provided data on : ( a ) the temperature profile in the envelope , proving that , as anticipated , the temperature follows a thermal equilibrium profile ; ( b ) the characteristic size and chemical composition of the dust grains , finding amorphous carbon as a main constituent of dust particles of a @xmath14 characteristic size ; ( c ) the absolute rates of dust formation , up to @xmath15 .",
    "unusually large , sub - micron , dust partilcles were found in independent surveys @xcite .",
    "the long - period , colliding - wind binaries wr 137 and wr 140 can be used as textbook examples of the ` binary ' channel of dust production .",
    "wr140 : this long - period ( p=7.93 y ) , highly eccentric ( e=0.881 : @xcite ) binary serves as a prototype for studies of wind - wind collision phenomena in massive binaries .",
    "its repeatable , giant near - ir outbursts @xcite are related to periastron passages , i.e. the intervals when the o star companion ploughs through the densest regions of the wr wind .",
    "additional compression of the wr outflow in the wind - wind collision zone allows the shocked gas to cool rather quickly , thus creating favorable conditions for condensation of dust which eventually leaves the system . indeed , after the 2001 periastron passage monnier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) detected slowly [ out]moving clumps of dust .",
    "the recent vlba ( s. dougherty , these proceedings ) , ukirt ( p. williams , these proceedings ) and iota3 @xcite imaging helped to establish a relation between the 2001 dust ejecta and the wind - wind collision zone wrapped around the o star .",
    "our high - quality @xmath16 images obtained with michelle / gemini - north in november , december 2003 show concentric dust arcs around wr140 which can be unequivocally linked with the 1993 and 2001 dust formation episodes ( fig .",
    "1 ) . combined with the independently acquired near - ir images",
    ", these data may allow one to confirm the preliminary conclusions about the properties of dust in wr 140 , i.e. the presence of fairly large dust grains with a characteristic size @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the massive long - period binary wr 137 was recognised as a periodically variable ir source by williams et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and included in the category of dust - producing wr+o binaries @xcite .",
    "thirteen years after the 1984 dust - production maximum , alarmed by the rising near - ir flux @xcite , we took h , k images with nicmos2/hst @xcite to find that , roughly one year after the 1996 periastron passage the system ejected a @xmath60.25 \" dust cloud at p.a.@xmath18 and a bright clump at p.a.@xmath19 , right along the plane corresponding to orientation of the equatorially - enhanced wind of the wr component @xcite .",
    "taking the @xmath16 images in 2003 ( fig .",
    "1 ) we find that the dust clouds continue to expand along the directions outlined by the 1997/1998 nicmos2 images , with the main outburst going se .",
    "there is no doubt that the equatorially - enhanced mass loss in the wr component plays a leading role in shaping the outcoming dust cloud .",
    "finishing our mid - ir survey of the wr ` dustars ' in 2004 , we find a spectacular dust envelope around wr48a ( fig .",
    "this presumably binary system underwent a major dust - formation outburst in 1979 followed by relatively small secondary outbursts in 1990 and 1994 @xcite .",
    "can the bright knots in fig .",
    "2 be related to the secondary events ? if not , then what else can influence the dust production rate at the particular ( and repeatable from orbit to orbit ) orbital phases ?    comparing the second - epoch image of wr112 ( fig .",
    "3 ) taken on july 2004 to the image from may 2001 @xcite , we find clear signs of slow expansion of the broken dust spiral .",
    "the rate of expansion allows us to estimate the distance to wr112 : @xmath20 , assuming @xmath21 .",
    "we re - inforce our previous conclusion that dust may survive in the hostile environment of the wr wind for a long time , up to @xmath22 years .",
    "six other ` dustars ' : wr 76 , wr 80 , wr 95 , wr 98a , wr 106 and wr 121 - were not resolved in the @xmath23 images taken with trecs / gemini - south .",
    "we use the excellent sky coverage of 2mass to conduct a galaxy - wide census of wr stars , adding to the 227 sources listed in @xcite all the recently discovered galatic center objects ( see the compilation in @xcite ) . working with the j - h vs. h - k diagrams of appropriately de - reddened sources and combining them with the k vs. j - k distributions",
    ", we were able to isolate the known population of wr ` dustars ' @xcite and find one new dust - producing source , wr102e .",
    "overall , there is no statistically significant difference between the known binary and presumably single wr ` dustars ' : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , while @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "slightly bluer color indices of the binaries can be explained by the presence of a luminous , hot companion ."
