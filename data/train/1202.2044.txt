    "it is generally agreed that all systems in the nature are described by appropriately formulated quantum theory .",
    "therefore , the fact that some systems , usually of macroscopic size , can be described by radically different theory , namely the classical physics , requires an explanation .",
    "clarifying the meaning in which the behavior described by the classical physics emerges from the quantum substrate is one of the main topics of the theory of quantum to classical relation ( qcr ) .",
    "multifarious aspects of the problem of qcr have been analyzed since the early formulations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the relevant literature on the topic is vast and we shall single out as illustrative examples only few reviews : the relevance of qcr to the notorious problem of quantum measurement is often discussed in the papers collected in @xcite and in @xcite which contains references to the more recent developments . some of the more formal mathematical aspects of qcr are treated in @xcite .",
    "dynamical aspects of qcr have been intensively discussed within the framework of the correspondence principle and the semi - classical methods for classically chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "putative physical mechanisms and the appropriate ontological considerations underlying qcr are discussed from different points of view for example in @xcite . during the last couple of decades detailed experimental studies of the problems related to qcr",
    "have been performed ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it has been realized many times that quantum and classical systems are related by some sort of coarse - graining .",
    "the coarse - graining enters differently in different theories of qcr , and is not always equally strongly emphasized . in the theories of decoherences",
    "@xcite the emphasis is on the influence of the environment , but the description of the environment must be coarse - grained to fulfill the desired decoherence effects . on the other hand , authors like @xcite and @xcite , to mention just a few representatives of the approach from two different periods and background ,",
    "emphasize the primary role of the coarse - graining , associated with limited precision of the devices used to observe the quantum system .",
    "in this paper we shall analyze the role of an appropriate coarse - graining for the emergence of a class of classical hamiltonian systems characterized by the spherical phase space .",
    "the points of the phase space are parameterized by the spherical angles @xmath0 or by the cartesian coordinates @xmath1 constrained by @xmath2 and the classical hamiltonian is a smooth function of @xmath3 .",
    "our goal is to show how the classical systems on the sphere can be derived from the quantum spin of size @xmath4 , i.e.  quantum systems with @xmath5 dynamical algebra and @xmath6-dimensional hilbert space of states .",
    "we shall see that the derivation of the classical system is done in two independent steps , both of which are necessary .",
    "the first step consist of an appropriate coarse - graining which introduces the classical phase space .",
    "classical like hamiltonian system is then defined on this phase space by appropriately constraining the quantum schrdinger evolution .",
    "the second step is the macroscopic limit applied on this coarse - grained and constrained system . as the result",
    "the coarse - grained and constrained system becomes indistinguishable from a classical system on the sphere .",
    "the same ideas have been recently utilized to study the appearance of a classical system of nonlinear oscillators from the corresponding quantum system @xcite .",
    "the two examples suggest formulation of a general procedure which shall be briefly discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we recapitulate the geometric hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics and of constrained quantum dynamics , with the special emphasis on the system with @xmath5 dynamical algebra , i.e.  the quantum spin .",
    "this representation is used in sec .",
    "iii to construct the classical model with the same dynamical algebra .",
    "section iv discusses the appearance of the classical system from the macro - limit of the coarse - grained and constrained quantum system . in sec .",
    "v we summarize our presentation .",
    "investigations of the relations between classical and quantum mechanics are facilitated if both theories are expressed using similar mathematical language .",
    "geometric hamiltonian formulation [ 16 - 25 ] and the geometric theory of coherent states @xcite are two such representations of quantum mechanics which are formulated in terms of mathematical objects typical for classical hamiltonian mechanics . in this section",
    "we shall briefly recapitulate the geometric hamiltonian formulation for the case of a quantum system with finite - dimensional hilbert space since this will be the main tool of our analyzes .",
    "in particular we shall summarize recently introduced description of constrained quantum systems @xcite within this formalism .",
    "group - theoretical and geometric treatment of the generalized coherent states , as it was introduced by perelomov @xcite , shall be used when needed without prior recapitulation .",
    "schrdinger dynamical equation on a separable and complete hilbert space @xmath7 generates a hamiltonian dynamical system on an appropriate symplectic manifold . the symplectic structure , which is needed for the hamiltonian formulation of the schrdinger dynamics , is provided by the imaginary part of the unitary scalar product on @xmath7 .",
    "in fact the hilbert space @xmath7 is viewed as a real manifold @xmath8 with a complex structure , given by a linear operator @xmath9 such that @xmath10 . if @xmath7 is finite @xmath11dimensional then @xmath12 , but in general @xmath8 is an infinite dimensional euclid manifold . in what follows",
    "we shall consider only the finite - dimensional hilbert spaces since the irreducible representations of the spin @xmath4 , i.e.the @xmath5 algebra , are of finite dimension : @xmath13 .",
    "real coordinates @xmath14 of a point @xmath15 are introduced using expansion coefficients @xmath16 in some basis @xmath17 of @xmath7 as follows    [ e : psi ] @xmath18    the real manifold @xmath19 has riemannian and symplectic structure .",
    "since @xmath8 is real it is natural to decompose the unitary scalar product on @xmath7 into it s real and imaginary parts @xmath20 it follows that @xmath21 is riemannian metric on @xmath8 and that @xmath22 is symplectic form on @xmath8 .",
    "thus the manifold @xmath8 associated with the hilbert space @xmath23 can be viewed as a phase space of a hamiltonian dynamical system , additionally equipped with the riemannian metric which reflects its quantum origin . a vector from @xmath7 , associated with a pure quantum state , is represented by the corresponding point in the phase space @xmath8 .",
    "we shall denote the point from @xmath8 associated with the vector @xmath24 by @xmath25 .    in the coordinates",
    "@xmath14 the riemannian and the symplectic structures of @xmath8 are given by @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are zero and unit matrices of dimension equal to the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "thus , coordinates @xmath14 represent canonical coordinates of a hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "consequently , the poisson bracket between two functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 on @xmath8 corresponding to the symplectic form @xmath22 is in the canonical coordinate @xmath14 representation given by @xmath32    a one parameter family of unitary transformations on @xmath7 generated by a self - adjoined operator @xmath33 is represented on @xmath8 by a flow generated by the hamiltonian vector field @xmath34 with the hamilton s function given by @xmath35 thus , quantum observables @xmath36 are represented by functions of the form @xmath37 . such and only such hamiltonian flows with the hamilton s function of the form ( 6 ) generate also isometries of the riemannian metric @xmath21 .",
    "more general hamiltonian flows on @xmath8 , corresponding to the hamilton s function which are not of the form ( 6 ) , do not generate isometries and do not have the physical interpretation of quantum observables .",
    "it can be seen easily that @xmath38\\rangle.\\ ] ] in the remaining text we will take @xmath39 . the schrdinger evolution equation",
    "@xmath40 is equivalent to the hamilton s equations on @xmath8 @xmath41 in the canonical coordinates @xmath14 the schrdinger evolution is given by @xmath42    we have constructed the hamiltonian dynamical system corresponding to the schrdinger evolution equation on @xmath23 .",
    "in fact phase invariance and arbitrary normalization of the quantum states imply that the proper space of pure quantum states is not the hilbert space used to formulate the schrdinger equation , but the projective hilbert space .",
    "this also is a khler manifold and can be used as a phase space of a geometrical hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , we shall continue to use the formulation in which points of the quantum phase space are identified with the vectors from @xmath7 since it is sufficient for our main purpose .",
    "the hamiltonian framework for quantum dynamics enables one to describe the evolution of a dynamical system generated by the schrdinger equation with quite general additional constraints @xcite .",
    "suppose that the evolution given by the hamiltonian @xmath43 is further constrained onto a submanifold @xmath44 of @xmath8 given by a set of @xmath45 independent functional equations @xmath46 equations of motion of the constrained system are in general obtained using the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "in the hamiltonian form , developed by dirac @xcite , the method assumes that the dynamics on @xmath44 is determined by the following set of differential equations @xmath47 that should be solved together with the equations of the constraints ( [ e : constr ] ) . for notational convenience",
    "we do not indicate in the gradient @xmath48 that it is defined on @xmath49 .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath50 are functions on @xmath49 that are to be determined from the following , so called compatibility , conditions @xmath51 on the constrained manifold @xmath44 .",
    "we shall not go into the details of the standard dirac s procedure that emphasizes the distinction between the first and the second class constraints . in order to apply the standard procedure",
    ", the constraints have to be regular .",
    "a set of constraints is irregular if there is at least one such that the derivative of the constraint with respect to at least one of the coordinates is zero in at least one point on the constrained manifold .",
    "otherwise the constraints are regular . in our case of finite - dimensional @xmath8 constraints",
    "are regular if for all @xmath52 @xmath53 for all @xmath54 and everywhere on the constrained manifold @xmath44 .",
    "if this is not satisfied the dirac s classification into the first and the second class is blurred and the straightforward application of dirac s recipe is not possible . it will turn out that the case of interest here involves precisely irregular constraints that must be described in the most convenient way .",
    "however , if the constrained manifold is symplectic then the dirac s procedure of constructing the constrained system and reducing it on the constrained manifold can be bypassed .",
    "in fact , the result of the procedure is known to be a hamiltonian system defined on the constrained manifold .",
    "the hamilton s function of the reduced constrained system is just the original hamiltonian evaluated at the constrained manifold @xcite .",
    "the phase space of the classical system is the sphere denoted @xmath44 , of some radius @xmath4 .",
    "pure states of the classical system are the points of the sphere , parameterized by the spherical angles @xmath0 , or equivalently by the corresponding vector @xmath55 of fixed length @xmath56 , or by the points of the complex plane @xmath57 .",
    "the symplectic structure of the classical phase space is expressed , for example , in terms of @xmath58 by @xmath59 the real coordinates @xmath60 given by @xmath61 are the canonical coordinates with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "the basic variables @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 form the @xmath5 algebra @xmath66 ( and cyclic permutations ) with respect to the poisson bracket induced by ( 15 ) .",
    "thus , the dynamical algebra of the classical system is the @xmath5 algebra .",
    "the hamilton function of the classical system is not necessarily an element of the @xmath5 algebra but is assumed to be expressible as a simple function of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the quantum system with the same dynamical algebra is the quantum spin .",
    "cartesian coordinates @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 of the spin operator @xmath70 satisfy the @xmath5 commutation relations : @xmath71=i\\hat j_z$ ] ( and cyclic permutations ) .",
    "the hilbert space of the spin of size @xmath4 is the space of @xmath6-dimensional irreducible @xmath5 representation .",
    "@xmath5 coherent states @xmath72 can be defined as the quantum states that minimize the total quantum fluctuation of @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 is the coherent state iff @xmath75 this is the main property of the coherent states for our purposes .",
    "alternatively , the coherent states are defined as the eigenstates corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of the operator @xmath76 the set of coherent states is parameterized by the points of the two - dimensional spherical submanifold @xmath44 of the @xmath77-dimensional quantum phase space @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore each coherent state satisfies : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 .",
    "thus the coherent states are in a one - to - one relation with the points of the phase space of the classical system .",
    "a classical pure state @xmath0 does not make a distinction between pure quantum states such that the average of the vector operator @xmath70 is a vector collinear with @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we define an equivalence relation on @xmath8 ( i.e. on @xmath7 ) as follows : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a positive scalar",
    ". the two quantum states are equivalent if they give collinear expectation vectors @xmath83 .",
    "each equivalence class of quantum pure states @xmath84 $ ] contains one and only one coherent state , i.e.  an @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "the partition of @xmath8 by the equivalence relation @xmath87 represents the coarse - grained description of the space of quantum pure states .",
    "the coarse - grained quantum states , i.e.  the coherent states , are parameterized by the classical pure states .",
    "schrdinger evolution equation for @xmath88 , or its hamiltonian form for @xmath89 , does not preserve the equivalence classes of quantum states ( 19 ) and the manifold of coherent states is not invariant . on the other hand , the system with the same hamiltonian and additional constraints introduced in such a way that the manifold of coherent states is invariant also preserves the equivalence classes of quantum states .",
    "this constrained hamiltonian system when restricted on the manifold of coherent states generates by definition the dynamics of the coarse - grained reduced quantum system .",
    "the constrained evolution of the quantum system with the corresponding total hamiltonian preserves small the total quantum fluctuation of @xmath70 for all times , which is the crucial property in the analyzes of its macro - limit .",
    "it is our goal in this subsection to construct the constrained hamiltonian evolution such that the manifold of coherent states is preserved . due to the unique representation of the equivalence classes by coherent states",
    "this condition on the evolution also implies that the coarse - grained states , i.e.  the equivalence classes , evolve as a single unit .",
    "the manifold of coherent states @xmath44 is uniquely determined by the total quantum fluctuation of the basic operators @xmath90 which is minimal if and only if the state is a coherent state .",
    "thus , the constraint @xmath91 determines the sphere of coherent states .",
    "the evolution of the coarse - grained system is defined to be the constrained hamiltonian evolution with the given hamiltonian @xmath92 and the constraint ( 20 ) .",
    "the master constraint that we want to fulfill is given by the function ( 20 ) , but that constraint is not regular because it is equivalent with @xmath93 .",
    "similarly to the case of oscillators treated in @xcite , the application of dirac s procedure with this constraint as the initial primary one is not straightforward , and would imply an additional number of secondary constraints .",
    "however , since the constrained manifold @xmath44 is known to be symplectic , the constrained system reduced on @xmath44 is hamiltonian with the hamilton s function given simply by @xmath94 .",
    "alternatively , one could obtain the constrained evolution equations on the full space @xmath8 , using an appropriate form of the primary constraints and then reduce the constrained system on the constrained manifold .",
    "following the idea presented in @xcite , one should replaced the irregular primary constraint ( 20 ) by a more effective equivalent primary constraint , formulated using the equivalence of states .",
    "the primary constraint that should be imposed would require that the average of the hamiltonian @xmath92 is equal to its average in the equivalent coherent state @xmath95 @xmath96 the lagrange multiplier in the total hamiltonian @xmath97 is simply @xmath98 and thus the total hamiltonian is @xmath99 as already stated , the restriction of the evolution of the resulting constrained system onto the constrained manifold of coherent states is guided simply by the hamiltonian @xmath100 .    in summary ,",
    "the hamilton s function of the coarse - grained and reduced system is just the @xmath101 .",
    "the states of the coarse - grained system are equivalence classes represented by the coherent states .",
    "the quantum constrained dynamics preserves the equivalence classes and the total quantum fluctuation remain minimal ( but nonzero ) throughout the evolution . of course , the coarse - grained system is not classical .",
    "the coherent states have nonzero overlap and the quantum fluctuations are , although minimal , nonzero .",
    "for example , if the quantum hamiltonian is a nonlinear expression in terms of the basic operators @xmath90 its expectation @xmath102 is different from @xmath103 where @xmath104 is of the same form as @xmath105 . due to the constraint dynamics of the coarse - grained model , the total quantum fluctuations are minimal and",
    "the difference between those two expressions is all the time bounded by terms of the leading order @xmath106 .",
    "the difference becomes arbitrary small as @xmath4 becomes sufficiently large .",
    "macro - limit of the coarse - grained system is discussed in the next section .",
    "notice that the reduced constrained hamilton s function @xmath107 is a valid hamiltonian for any hermitian operator @xmath36 , while the hamilton s function of the classical model must be a function of the expectations of the basic operators @xmath108 .",
    "sometimes the hamiltonian of a quantum system is a sum of terms linear in the dynamical algebra generators and a small perturbation containing some nonlinear terms . in such cases",
    "the manifold of coherent states of the dynamical algebra is approximately invariant over some finite time .",
    "this fact has been used ( see for example @xcite or more recent @xcite ) to propose and study an approximation of the exact quantum dynamics , from some coherent state or a mixture of such , by the equations of classical hamiltonian form with the hamilton s function given by @xmath109 . in our approach",
    "the reduced constrained hamiltonian equations of the coarse - grained system appear as the evolution equations of the equivalence classes of the quantum states .",
    "the equations are the evolution equations of the coarse - grained quantum system whatever the form of the hamilton s operator is .",
    "in this section we want to demonstrate that for sufficiently large @xmath4 the states of the coarse - grained system and their evolution display properties of a classical system .",
    "in particular we shall show that for sufficiently large @xmath4 : ( a ) the coarse - grained system appears to be in one and only one classical state ; ( b ) the state of the coarse - grained system can be determined without measurable disturbance ; ( c ) the evolution of the coarse - grained system is such that the property ( a ) is valid for all times , or in other words , ratios @xmath110 @xmath111 remain arbitrary small during the evolution ; ( d ) the evolutions of the coarse - grained system and of the classical model become indistinguishable .",
    "as the consequence of these properties the reduced constrained system with sufficiently large @xmath4 is the same as the classical model for all observational devices with arbitrary but finite accuracy .",
    "the properties ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are based on the fact that the overlap between the coherent states @xmath112 becomes arbitrary small for sufficiently large @xmath4 , where @xmath113 is the angle between directions @xmath0 and @xmath114 correspondong to @xmath74 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "thus , for an observation with arbitrary but finite accuracy , different coherent states appear as orthogonal .",
    "the property ( a ) is in fact the same as the near orthogonality of the coherent states for large @xmath4 . to demonstrate the property ( b ) consider the measurement in the overcomplete basis given by the coherent states . upon such measurement the representative of the coarse - grained state @xmath72",
    "is transformed into @xmath116 which is approximately equal to @xmath72 due to near orthogonality of the coherent states for large @xmath4 .",
    "thus , disturbance of the states of the reduced system with sufficiently large @xmath4 by the measurement of classical properties is negligibly small .",
    "evolution of the reduced system is defined precisely such that the dispersions @xmath117 @xmath111 remain small , and thus the ratios @xmath118 are arbitrarily small for sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath119 where @xmath120 is an arbitrary polynomial expression .",
    "thus , the evolution of the coarse - grained and reduced system with large @xmath4 and the hamiltonian @xmath121 is indistinguishable from the classical evolution generated by the hamilton s function @xmath122 .",
    "we can conclude that the reduced constrained system for large @xmath4 displays all typical properties of a classical hamiltonian system in all physically possible observations .",
    "if the hamiltonian of the quantum system is a nonlinear expression of the basic operators of the dynamical algebra then the schrdinger evolution with the hamiltonian @xmath123 , the evolution of the reduced constrained system by the hamiltonian @xmath124 ( 22 ) , and the evolution of the classical model with the hamiltonian @xmath125 , starting from the same coherent state , are all different . however , when the spin size @xmath4 increases the difference between the evolution of the coarse - grained and reduced system and of the classical model decreases .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large @xmath4 the differences become negligible over arbitrary large periods of time . these facts are illustrated in this section using as an example the following hamiltonian : @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 23 ) appears as the most convenient form of the two mode bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the constrained system reduced on @xmath44 is a hamiltonian system on @xmath44 with the hamilton s function given by @xmath109 . to express it as a function of the canonical coordinates",
    "@xmath129 of @xmath44 we need the appropriate expectations of linear and quadratic operators in terms of @xmath129 .",
    "the relevant formulas are given by : @xmath130 and @xmath131 the last term in ( 25 ) , proportional to @xmath106 represent the quantum correction to the expectation of the nonlinear operator @xmath132 .",
    "the hamilton s function @xmath133 of the constrained system reduced on @xmath44 is given by @xmath134.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hamilton s function of the classical model is obtained by assuming that the last term in square brackets in ( 26 ) is in fact equal to zero , i.e.  @xmath135 .",

    "time series @xmath140 are shown .",

    "parameters are @xmath141 and the initial state is the coherent state @xmath142 .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the evolution of the average @xmath143 generated by the constrained system ( 26 ) and by the classical model ( 27 ) . the initial state for the constrained system is the coherent state @xmath144 implying @xmath145 . the main conclusion of fig .",
    "1 is that the constrained and the classical evolutions become indistinguishable as @xmath4 becomes sufficiently large .",
    "we would now like to compare the coarse - graining whose fundamental role is analyzed in this paper with two different types of coarse - graining commonly used in the studies of micro - macro transition .",
    "we consider the coarse - graining ( a ) in the mean field type approach to the appearance of macro - properties and ( b ) motivated by the finite precision of the measuring instruments .",
    "let us first discuss the coarse - graining of the type ( a ) .",
    "typical example is the treatment of macroscopic magnetization defined as the average of the spin components over an ensemble of spins : @xmath146 @xmath111 .",
    "all states of the ensemble which give the same average of the large spin @xmath147 components are considered equivalent . however , the large spin is a quantum system which can be in states corresponding to superpositions of macroscopically distinct eigenvalues of its observables .",
    "no classical behavior is implied by the coarse - graining that replaced the ensemble of spins by the single large spin @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the coarse - graining that treats as indistingushable the eigenstates of an observable with nearby eigenvalues also does not introduce the classical behavior .",
    "thus the coarse - graining of type ( a ) or of type ( b ) although justified are not crucial for the explanation of the emergence of classical systems .    to summarize",
    ", we have analyzed the conditions for the emergence of a classical hamiltonian dynamical system on the sphere from the quantum spin .",
    "the main condition behind the classical appearance is that only a limited set of averages of quantum observables is distinguished in the classical system .",
    "this naturally leads to the corresponding equivalence relation among the quantum states .",
    "the equivalence relation represent a type of coarse - graining , such that in each equivalence class there is one and only one state with minimal total quantum fluctuation , i.e.  the corresponding coherent state .",
    "if the equivalence classes or their representatives are to be identified with states of the appropriate classical system then they must evolve as single units .",
    "this leads to the constrained hamiltonian dynamics which preserves the manifold of coherent states .",
    "for an observer with sufficiently limited observational accuracy the constrained system reduced on the manifold of coherent states displays all characteristic properties of a classical system . the upper limit on the observational accuracy with which the system appears as classical can be increased as the size of the spin @xmath4 is increased but is ultimately limited by the physical nature of possible observational devices .    in the reference",
    "@xcite we have applied the same ideas and methods to explain the emergence of the classical system of oscillators from the corresponding quantum system .",
    "the important difference , of ultimately geometrical origin , between the system of oscillators and the spin is in the form of the equivalence relation i.e.  the form of the coarse - graining .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases the role of the coarse - graining is the same .",
    "the two examples of the oscillators and the spin suggest a general explanation of the emergence of classical models from quantum systems with the same dynamical lie algebra .",
