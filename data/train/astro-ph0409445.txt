    "recent cosmological observations have provided strong evidence that a dark - energy component , such as the cosmological constant , comprises as much as 70 per cent of the total energy density of the universe ( @xcite ) . characterizing the nature of the dark energy and its possible",
    "evolution has become a central goal of empirical work in cosmology .",
    "galaxy surveys measure the clustering statistics of galaxies as a function of scale and redshift .",
    "the galaxy power spectrum can be compared to the cmb power spectrum to constrain the growth of structure .",
    "however the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum depends on the biasing of the particular galaxy sample ; one therefore needs to exercise care in using the full power spectrum for cosmological inferences ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum has been regarded as more robust to biasing effects .",
    "the baryon oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum are imprints from acoustic oscillations in the early universe , prior to recombination .",
    "the same physics produces the dramatic peaks and troughs seen in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "their physical scale is set by the sound horizon at recombination , which has been determined accurately from cmb data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the baryon oscillations in the matter and galaxy power spectra are much weaker features because the dark matter which dominates the mass density did not participate in the acoustic oscillations .",
    "the oscillations are at the level of a few tens of a percent variation about the smoothed power spectrum . with a survey of sufficient size",
    ", these features can be measured accurately .",
    "since the physical length scale of the baryon oscillations is known from the cmb measurement of the sound horizon , a measurement of their apparent size in redshift or angle space leads to a measurement of purely geometric quantities : the hubble parameter and the angular diameter distance , respectively .",
    "we will be concerned with the relation between physical size and angular diameter distance : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath2 is the measured angular scale .",
    "this relation can be used for a statistical quantity as well ; for the power spectrum it means that a measurement of an angular wavenumber @xmath3 and its relation to the physical wavenumber @xmath4 yields @xmath5 .",
    "we describe in the next section how @xmath1 constrains models of dark energy .",
    "to measure baryon oscillations , many authors have considered galaxy surveys over different redshift ranges ( @xcite ) . for spectroscopic redshift surveys ,",
    "the tangential and radial components are considered separately since the latter is subject to redshift distortions .",
    "current redshift surveys can map large enough volumes at redshifts well below 0.5 .",
    "it is a great advantage to probe higher redshifts since additional baryon oscillations can then be measured within the linear regime of clustering ( the linear regime extends to smaller physical scales at high redshifts ) . with future redshift surveys , such as the proposed kaos survey ,",
    "such a measurement would be possible .",
    "multi - color imaging surveys are already in progress , e.g. the sdss , the cfh legacy survey , and deeper surveys are proposed for the future , e.g. panstarrs , lsst , snap and others .",
    "these surveys offer the possibility of photometric redshifts as crude redshift estimators . with the sdss providing a large sample of relatively nearby galaxies , and the hubble deep fields and the goods survey providing deep samples of galaxies beyond @xmath6 , many multi - color samples of galaxies",
    "have been studied and used to estimate photometric redshifts . with good",
    "photometry in 45 optical filters , it is expected that a statistical accuracy characterized by an rms of @xmath7 in @xmath8 is achievable for galaxies below @xmath6 . for special samples such as the large red galaxy ( lrg ) sample of the sdss",
    ", one can do significantly better .",
    "similarly it is expected that with more filters and experience with estimating photo-@xmath9 s , the accuracy will improve and extend to higher redshifts .",
    "this is an area of ongoing study ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the accuracy of photometric redshifts determines the bin width in redshift within which angular power spectra can be measured and regarded as being independent of neighboring bins ( i.e. the overlap in the galaxy distribution between neighboring bins is small ) .",
    "this is important because wide bins would cause the baryon wiggle features to be smeared out .",
    "following @xcite we will assume that @xmath10 in @xmath8 .",
    "note that this is not a very stringent requirement ; at @xmath6 , it means the rms error in the photometric redshift is below @xmath11 .",
    "given a large number @xmath12 of galaxies with photo-@xmath9 s , the mean redshift is measured accurately since the error in it is suppressed by @xmath13 , which can be very small even per redshift bin for surveys of several 100 or 1000 square degrees .",
    "however , when the photo-@xmath9 s are estimated in terms of a probability distribution over redshift per galaxy , often the result is bi - modal or worse .",
    "thus there are sometimes large errors in the estimated photo-@xmath9 , and for certain redshift ranges they lead to systematic biases .",
    "while calibration with spectroscopic redshifts of some fraction of the galaxies can be used to limit such a bias , we will explore the sensitivity of our dark - energy constraints to possible biases in the mean bin redshift .",
    "our focus will be on the question : can subtle effects in the biasing of galaxies compromise the dark - energy constraints obtained from them ?",
    "we will use the bispectrum , the fourier transform of the three - point function , as an independent measure of the biasing of galaxies .",
    "the idea of using the bispectrum in addition to the power spectrum on large scales to constrain both the amplitude of the mass power spectrum and bias has been suggested and implemented ( @xcite ) . in this study",
    "we will examine whether it can help constrain a possibly redshift dependent bias that could mimic effects of the cosmological model we are trying to constrain .",
    "we will also compute the gain in signal to noise that the bispectrum provides .",
    "we will use perturbation theory , valid in the weakly nonlinear regime of clustering .",
    "the expansion history of the universe is given by the scale factor @xmath14 in a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "for cosmological purposes , dark energy is associated with a density field , possibly weakly evolving over cosmic time , that affects the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath15 .",
    "the expansion rate at late cosmic times depends on contributions from the density of non - relativistic matter , @xmath16 ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and the dark - energy density , @xmath17 .",
    "our notation is such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the present day values in units of the critical density , @xmath18 .",
    "the dark - energy formalism introduces a new , time - dependent density described by the dark - energy equation of state : @xmath19 this density component is allowed to have an arbitrary time dependence ; it must be constrained by theory and observation . due to lack of compelling theoretical models for the dark energy ,",
    "it is typical to introduce a parameterization for @xmath20 to be determined empirically .",
    "we follow @xcite and parameterize the equation of state as @xmath21 note that setting @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , corresponds to the equation of state for a cosmological constant .",
    "we assume a flat universe throughout this paper .",

    "the ( comoving ) distance , @xmath26 , from an observer at redshift zero to a source at scale factor @xmath27 is given by : @xmath28 hence , given a cosmological standard ruler , such as the length scale associated with one of the peaks of baryon - induced oscillations in the power spectrum at a given redshift , one may obtain dark - energy constraints via constraints on the distance function .",
    "dark energy that has negative pressure , i.e. , @xmath29 as observed today , leads to repulsive gravity and therefore does not cluster significantly .",
    "true , we are interested in clustering on large scales in this paper , yet spatial fluctuations in the dark energy are not expected to be significant below the present horizon scale ( @xcite ) , which we do not approach .",
    "we thus treat dark energy as a function only of epoch .",
    "however , since the expansion rate is altered , time - dependent dark energy does modify the redshift evolution of mass clustering . in linear theory ,",
    "all fourier modes of the mass density perturbation , @xmath30 ( relative to the average @xmath31 ) , grow independently and at the same rate , so @xmath32 defines the growth factor , @xmath33 .",
    "the growth factor is obtained by solving the linearized perturbation equation : @xmath34 , where the dot denotes derivative with respect to physical time .",
    "this equation can be manipulated to obtain a differential equation for the growth factor or , alternatively , the growth rate relative to that for a flat , matter - dominated universe , @xmath35 ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath36        \\frac{1}{a } \\frac{{\\rmn{d}}g}{{\\rmn{d}}a }      = \\frac{3}{2 } \\left [ w(a ) - 1 \\right ] \\omega_\\rmn{de}(a ) \\frac{g}{a^2}.\\ ] ] the dark - energy density parameter at epoch @xmath37 is denoted @xmath38 , and is obtained from the relations @xmath39",
    "@xmath40    we restrict our attention to the quasi - linear regime and expand the matter density contrast perturbatively as ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath41    we suppose a biasing prescription to obtain the galaxy density contrast from the matter density : @xmath42    we allow for primordial tilt and run in the linear power spectrum by introducing the spectral index , @xmath43 , and run , @xmath44 , parameters defined at @xmath45 , as in @xcite : @xmath46 for @xmath47 , we use the transfer function of @xcite that includes baryon oscillations . we determine @xmath48 by cmb normalization using the relation @xmath49 ^ 2        \\omega_\\rmn{m}^{-2 }        \\left ( \\frac{k_0 ^ 3}{2 \\pi^2 } \\right)^{-1}.\\ ] ] that is , the normalization is determined by normalizing the density perturbation amplitude at @xmath45 from the primordial curvature fluctuation contrast , @xmath50 .",

    "we have explored the prospects for obtaining interesting dark - energy constraints from the angular galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "the use of the bispectrum adds some new information , though the signal - to - noise is significantly smaller than that of the power spectrum .",
    "however , its value lies in making dark - energy constraints robust against biasing features that can not be measured with the power spectrum alone .",
    "we have shown that using the configuration dependence of the bispectrum , even a nonlinear , redshift - dependent bias characterized by 20 parameters in our study , can be measured and marginalized over .",
    "the dark - energy constraints we obtain are weaker than those expected from type ia supernovae or weak lensing .",
    "an ambitious spectroscopic survey could also do better by using three dimensional information ( e.g. seo & eisenstein 2003 ; linder 2003 ) .",
    "however it is worth emphasising that our requirements of a multi - color imaging survey place no additional burdens over what is needed for weak lensing . surveys such as the cfh legacy survey are already in progress , and several larger surveys are planned for the future .",
    "we have made conservative choices of redshift binning and the maximum redshift used , to ensure that photometric redshift uncertainties would be well below the requirements .",
    "thus we believe that , at the very least , the angular galaxy statistics would provide a useful independent check on dark - energy constraints from imaging surveys . as discussed below , it is possible to improve the constraints to levels competitive with the methods mentioned above by increasing survey area , depth and quality of photometric redshifts .",
    "high redshift ( @xmath80 ) galaxies are important to obtain the parameter constraints at the level advertised here .",
    "this is true for several reasons .",
    "the linear regime extends to smaller scales at higher redshifts because nonlinear evolution progresses to larger scales over time .",
    "this is evident from fig  [ fig : peaks ] , which demonstrates that , at higher redshifts , a greater number of the baryon - induced peaks lie in the linear region .",
    "the three dimensional nonlinear scale , @xmath81 , is a factor of two smaller at @xmath82 than at @xmath83 .",
    "further , the two - dimensional nonlinear scale , @xmath84 , depends not only on @xmath81 , but also on the angular diameter distance , which for @xmath82 is a factor of 3 larger than at @xmath83 . for ongoing and future deep imaging surveys",
    "the number density of galaxies in these higher redshifts bins is larger .",
    "this is helpful in that we can select special classes of galaxies with useful properties , such as the luminous red galaxies studied from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "even if they are a small fraction of the galaxy population , the shot noise contribution is not likely to be a limiting factor as discussed above and by seo & eisenstein ( 2003 ) .",
    "since we wish to learn about the time dependence of the dark - energy equation of state , it is important to sample our statistics over a wide enough range in redshift . in particular , for the equation of state we have used , which is linear in the scale factor , the degeneracy between @xmath85 and @xmath86 is broken by sampling galaxies over several redshift bins across a range of redshifts .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_f_sky ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift_scaling ] , where the marginalized 1-@xmath87 constraints for the dark - energy parameters are plotted as a function of survey redshift depth .",
    "the constraints from a survey that extends to @xmath88 are twice as good as one that goes to @xmath89 .",
    "-@xmath85 plane for different values of the maximum redshift bin used for the analysis .",
    "the right panel shows constraints for different survey areas , given by the values of the sky fraction , @xmath73 . ]    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : z_f_sky ] shows the dependence of dark - energy constraints on survey area .",
    "while the errors do not scale simply with @xmath73 due to the use of cmb priors , there is a significant improvement with every factor of two in sky coverage . using fig .",
    "[ fig : z_f_sky ] , our fiducial values can be scaled to a range of survey depths and areas .",
    "the ability to use the deep imaging capability of future surveys to go well beyond @xmath90 will depend in part on the accuracy of the photometric redshifts . with low enough scatter in these and even a very small sub - sample of spectroscopic redshifts for calibration",
    ", the methods we have explored can provide much better constraints on dark - energy models , especially models with a larger component of the dark - energy density at higher redshifts . as discussed by seo & eisenstein ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the requirements on photometric redshift scatter are not severe : an rms of @xmath91 in @xmath8 is adequate .",
    "here we have further checked that residual biases in the mean redshift of each bin do not significantly degrade dark - energy constraints ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : z_mean_scaling ] ) .",
    "hence it is not unreasonable to hope that the innermost contour of fig .",
    "[ fig : z_f_sky ] , corresponding to the highest redshift bin at @xmath92 , will be achievable for a high quality survey .",
    "in addition , a smaller rms in the photometric redshifts will mean that we can use effectively smaller redshift bins to improve the constraints .",
    "a rigorous analysis of redshift binning would require the use of cross - spectra and their covariances ; alternatively , the galaxy distribution could be treated as three dimensional , with large errors in the redshift coordinate ( seo & eisenstein 2003 ) .    besides the baryon oscillation features , dark - energy parameters affect the overall shape and amplitude of the angular power spectrum and bispectrum . to separate the effects of the oscillations , we calculated galaxy fisher matrices using the `` no - wiggles '' transfer function of @xcite .",
    "if we use just the galaxy clustering information , the constraints for the no - wiggles case are about twice as large . with cmb priors ,",
    "the effect is smaller as the cmb enables the amplitude of the spectra to also provide information .",
    "we do still have a standard ruler in the no - wiggles case : the peak in the power spectrum corresponding to matter - radiation equality ( @xcite ) .",
    "the physical length scale of this ruler is set at decoupling by @xmath93 , which can be well constrained by the cmb .",
    "hence the broad shape of the power spectrum adds information on angular diameter distances .",
    "the amplitude depends on the bias parameter and the growth factor , which is sensitive to the dark energy . using both the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum with the cmb , the scalar amplitude @xmath53 , the two bias parameters , @xmath94 , and the power spectrum amplitude in each redshift bin , are constrained sufficiently well .",
    "we have tested our choices of fiducial bias parameters and the quasi - linear regime .",
    "we repeated our analysis by setting @xmath84 to half the value used , and find that it leads to a 611 per cent degradation in the dark - energy constraints for galaxy plus cmb information .",
    "thus our results are not very sensitive to the choice of cutoff of the quasi - linear regime and the neglect of non - gaussian contributions to the covariances .",
    "since one of the goals of our formalism is to allow for a nontrivial biasing of the galaxies , we also performed our analysis with @xmath95 as the fiducial value , thus allowing for a nonlinear term in the biasing .",
    "it led to improved constraints on most parameters due to a larger impact of adding bispectrum information , e.g. the 1-@xmath87 uncertainty in the dark - energy parameters was lower by 10 per cent .",
    "more importantly , we find that @xmath71 can be measured sufficiently well for a wide range of fiducial values , so that an effectively nonlinear , scale - dependent bias can be consistently incorporated in our analysis .",
    "this validates our conclusion that bias and dark - energy constraints can be simultaneously obtained by using the bispectrum .",
    "an alternate approach to galaxy biasing and other properties is to use the halo model , which may also enable us to probe smaller scales , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the analytical models for the bispectrum need to checked and calibrated with @xmath12-body simulations .",
    "a large number of independent realizations would be needed since the covariances in the bispectra need to be accurately measured as well .",

    "<S> baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum have been studied as a way of probing dark - energy models . </S>",
    "<S> while most studies have focused on spectroscopic surveys at high redshift , large multi - color imaging surveys have already been planned for the near future . in view of this , we study the prospects for measuring baryonic oscillations from angular statistics of galaxies binned using photometric redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we use the galaxy bispectrum in addition to the power spectrum ; this allows us to measure and marginalize over possibly complex galaxy bias mechanisms to get robust cosmological constraints . in our parameter estimation </S>",
    "<S> we allow for a weakly nonlinear biasing scheme that may evolve with redshift by two bias parameters in each of ten redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a multi - color imaging survey that probes redshifts beyond one can give interesting constraints on dark - energy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the shape of the primordial power spectrum can be measured to better accuracy than with the cmb alone . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the impact of survey depth , area , and calibration errors in the photometric redshifts on dark - energy constraints .    </S>",
