    "<S> in landau gauge qcd the infrared behavior of the propagator of transverse gluons can be analytically determined to be a power law from dyson  schwinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> this propagator clearly shows positivity violation , indicating the absence of the transverse gluons from the physical spectrum , _ i.e. _ gluon confinement . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analytic structure for the gluon propagator is proposed capturing all important features . </S>",
    "<S> we provide arguments that the landau gauge quark propagator possesses a singularity on the real timelike axis . </S>",
    "<S> for this propagator we find a positive definite schwinger function .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard model of particle physics consists of gauge field theories . </S>",
    "<S> these have been postulated on the basis of symmetries and their elementary excitations do not reflect the observed particle spectrum . in the quantum formulation of these theories , especially in poincar - covariant gauges , an intricate problem is posed by the separation of physical and unphysical degrees of freedom .    in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in linear covariant gauges </S>",
    "<S> , the electromagnetic field can be decomposed into transverse , longitudinal and timelike photons , however , only transverse polarizations are observed . from a purely mathematical point of view , this can be understood from the representations of the poincar group for massless states : massless particles have only two possible polarizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent contradiction is resolved by the fact that timelike and longitudinal photons cancel exactly in the @xmath0-matrix @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the states of quantum gauge field theories in covariant gauges necessarily constitute an indefinite metric space </S>",
    "<S> . in covariant gauge qed one thus has to sacrifice the principle of positivity of the representation space .    in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in linear covariant gauges , the cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom in the @xmath0-matrix is substantially complicated by the self - interaction of the gauge fields and by the ghost fields that are necessarily present in the quantum formulation of these theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to order @xmath1 in perturbation theory , one obtains amplitudes for the scattering of two transverse gluons into one transverse and one longitudinal gluon . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the same order , a ghost loop appears and cancels the various gluon loops , and scattering of transverse to longitudinal gluons does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to prove this cancellation to all orders in perturbation theory on the basis of the brs @xcite symmetry of the covariantly gauge fixed theory . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry can be represented by gauge transformations with the ghost field as a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the ghost fields , being scalar , anti - commuting fields , are necessarily in the unphysical part of the representation space . in covariant gauge qcd , </S>",
    "<S> the physical ( and thus positive definite ) part of the state space is conjectured to be the set of brs singlets @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> gauge fixed qcd is invariant under transformations related to the ghost number , and employing such transformations , one can show that brs non - singlets occur in quartets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a brs - quartet consists of two parent and two daughter states of respectively opposite ghost numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the latter states are brs - exact and thus brs - closed because the brs transformation is nilpotent . </S>",
    "<S> the brs daughters are orthogonal to all other states in the positive definite subspace and therefore do not contribute to physical @xmath0-matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> the parent states belong to the indefinite metric part of the representation space and are expected to violate positivity .    </S>",
    "<S> the kugo  ojima confinement scenario @xcite describes a mechanism by which the positive semi - definite , physical state space contains only colorless states . </S>",
    "<S> colored states are not brs singlets and therefore do not appear in @xmath0-matrix elements : they are confined . </S>",
    "<S> thus an investigation of ( non-)positivity of transverse gluons and quarks allows us to understand confinement via the brs quartet mechanism in more detail .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present analytic properties of the gluon and quark propagators in landau gauge qcd as they result from non - perturbative calculations ( more details can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm previous results @xcite on positivity violation for the gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a parameterization of the gluon propagator that is analytic throughout the complex @xmath2 plane except on the real timelike axis and which decreases to zero in every direction of the complex @xmath2 plane . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior satisfies the usual axioms of local quantum field theory @xcite ( except positivity ) . for the quark propagator </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze several general constraints , lattice data @xcite , and solutions of the coupled quark - gluon - ghost dyson  schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> none of these contradict positivity of the quark propagator .    </S>",
    "<S> within the framework of a euclidean quantum field theory ( used in the following ) , positivity is formulated in terms of the osterwalder  schrader axiom of reflection positivity @xcite . in the special case of a two point correlation function , @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the condition of reflection positivity can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a complex valued test function with support in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> after a three - dimensional fourier transformation , this condition can be given in terms of the schwinger function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a scalar function extracted from the corresponding two - point function .    </S>",
    "<S> the elementary two - point functions of qcd are the ghost , gluon , and quark propagators . in landau gauge </S>",
    "<S> these renormalized momentum - space propagators @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 can be generically written as @xmath12 note that the quark propagator @xmath11 is decomposed into scalar and vector parts , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> violation of reflection positivity can be studied by calculating eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ schwinger ] ) with @xmath15 for the transverse gluons and @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> ( the ghost propagator violates reflection positivity by the way ghosts are introduced in faddeev  popov quantization . )    </S>",
    "<S> the coupled set of dses ( for recent reviews see _ e.g. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) for the ghost and gluon propagators can be solved analytically for @xmath16 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one finds simple power laws for the gluon and ghost dressing functions @xmath17 such that the product @xmath18 goes to a constant in the infrared : there is an infrared fixed point for the running coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the exponent @xmath19 is in the range @xmath20 , depending on details of the truncation of the set of dses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we use a self - consistent truncation scheme @xcite which neglects the effects of the four - gluon interaction and employs _ anstze _ for the ghost - gluon , quark - gluon , and three - gluon vertices such that two important constraints are fulfilled : the running coupling , @xmath21 , is independent of the renormalization point , and the anomalous dimensions of the propagators are reproduced at one - loop level for large momenta . in this particular truncation </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 @xcite is an irrational number , and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> infrared dominance of the gauge fixing part of the qcd action @xcite implies infrared dominance of ghosts in the dses which , in turn , can be used to show @xcite that @xmath24 depends only weakly on the dressing of the ghost - gluon vertex and not at all on other vertex functions . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the same infrared behavior of the propagators has been found using the method of exact renormalization group equations @xcite .    for quenched qcd , the gluon propagator , </S>",
    "<S> as it results from numerical solution of the coupled dses for the gluon and ghost propagators , agrees very well with recent lattice data @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ xx1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the unquenched dse gluon propagator is significantly suppressed in the intermediate momentum region , where screening effects of @xmath25 pairs becomes important . for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 the infrared behavior </S>",
    "<S> is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g - power ] ) .     and the fit ( ) are shown . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding running coupling can be accurately represented by @xcite @xmath28 \\ , , \\hspace*{3 mm }   \\label{fitb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the landau pole at spacelike @xmath30 is canceled , _ </S>",
    "<S> c.f . </S>",
    "<S> _ ref .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the expression ( [ fitb ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is analytic in the complex @xmath2 plane except on the real timelike axis ( @xmath31 ) where the logarithm produces a cut .    </S>",
    "<S> since the infrared exponent , @xmath19 , is an irrational number , one knows that the corresponding gluon propagator possesses a cut on the negative real axis as well . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to fit the dse solution for the gluon propagator without introducing further singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to the gluon renormalization function with the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 mev , is in good agreement with the dse solution . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 is a normalization parameter , and @xmath36 is the one - loop value for the anomalous dimension of the gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity across the cut in @xmath37 vanishes for @xmath38 , diverges to @xmath39 at @xmath40 on both sides and drops to zero for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> additional parameterizations have been explored in ref .  @xcite .    the corresponding schwinger function , @xmath42 , based on the fit , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fitii ] ) , is compared to the dse solution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ xx2 ] . to enable a logarithmic scale </S>",
    "<S> , the absolute value is displayed . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 has a zero for @xmath43 and is negative for larger euclidean times . </S>",
    "<S> _ i.e. _ we clearly observe positivity violations in the dse gluon propagator and the agreement of the numerical schwinger function with the fourier transformed fit is also excellent . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial property for positivity violation in the gluon propagator is that it vanishes for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the relation @xmath45 which implies that the gluon propagator in coordinate space , @xmath46 , is trivially zero or necessarily contains positive as well as negative contributions .        in expression ( [ fitii ] ) , the overall magnitude , @xmath35 , is arbitrary because of renormalization properties ( it is determined via the choice of the renormalization scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared exponent , @xmath19 , is determined from the infrared analysis of the dses , and the one - loop value is used for the gluon anomalous dimension , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have found a parameterization of the gluon propagator which has effectively only one parameter , the scale @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this and the relatively simple analytic structure gives us confidence that we have succeeded in uncovering the important features of the landau gauge gluon propagator .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the analytic structure of the quark propagator . in the dse studies of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it has been assumed that the non - abelian part of the quark - gluon vertex can be factored out from the tensor structure . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is then given by the curtis  </S>",
    "<S> pennington vertex @xcite which , by construction , is multiplicatively renormalizable and satisfies the abelian ward  </S>",
    "<S> takahashi identity of qed . in this particular case one has a term @xmath49 in the vertex . </S>",
    "<S> for the present discussion it is important to note that the exact quark - gluon vertex ( which satisfies the more complicated slavnov  taylor identity of qcd ) , and future improved approximations to it , will almost certainly also exhibit such a quark - gluon coupling proportional to the sum of quark momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling , being effectively scalar , is not invariant under chiral transformations in contrast to the leading @xmath50 part of the vertex . </S>",
    "<S> however , the term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltab ] ) only appears once chiral symmetry is broken dynamically and is thus consistent with the chiral ward identities . </S>",
    "<S> its existence provides a significant self - consistent enhancement of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the quark dse , which is necessary to produce an acceptable value of the chiral condensate @xcite . quite independently of the form of the gluon propagator , the resulting quark propagator respects positivity if the term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltab ] ) is included in the quark - gluon vertex @xcite , as evidenced by the schwinger functions in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ xx3 ] ( solid and dashed curves ) . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we also see that positivity is violated if only the bare quark - gluon vertex is used ( dotted curve ) , in agreement with previous work employing this approximation  @xcite .        a single real pole on the negative momentum axis results in a pure exponential decay of the corresponding schwinger function . </S>",
    "<S> this is not what is observed in @xmath51 for small times where there is some curvature ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ xx3 ] ) . to give an acceptable reproduction of @xmath51 , analytic parameterizations of </S>",
    "<S> the quark propagator must contain additional sub - dominant structure . </S>",
    "<S> by fourier transforming combinations of functions with cuts and poles at timelike momenta we have determined three simple sources for such curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant singularity may be accompanied by additional real singularities at larger mass scales , or by complex conjugate singularities with a larger real part of the mass , or it may be the starting point of a branch cut on the negative real momentum axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course such a list is by no means exhaustive .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have used various general requirements , lattice data @xcite , and the dse solutions @xcite to constrain these various parametric forms . </S>",
    "<S> such analysis leads to an important conclusion : in all parameterizations , the dominant singularity must occur on ( or _ very _ close to ) the real , timelike half - axis at a scale @xmath52 to @xmath53  mev , the lower estimate coming when lattice data are used for the fit , the upper estimate for fits to the dse solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this scale may relate to a constituent quark mass .    whilst this result is robust , our current methods are not able to accurately determine the nature of the dominant singularity or reliably constrain the additional sub - dominant structures . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the regular infrared behavior of quark propagator found in the dse and lattice calculations makes determining its detailed analytic properties very difficult without explicitly probing the timelike momentum half - plane . </S>",
    "<S> a more conclusive analysis of the structure of the quark propagator would result from direct solution of the dses over an appropriate region of the complex momentum plane .    to summarize : we have proposed the relatively simple function , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fitii ] ) , to describe the full ( non - perturbative ) landau gauge gluon renormalization function for all complex values of momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding gluon propagator agrees well with dse solutions and lattice data for spacelike momenta , it is positivity violating , and it is analytic everywhere except for a cut on the negative real @xmath2 half - axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus it implies that in landau gauge qcd , the confinement of transverse gluons is related to the violation of osterwalder  </S>",
    "<S> schrader reflection positivity . </S>",
    "<S> we have also provided evidence that the schwinger functions related to the quark propagator are positive definite , and consequently quark confinement is not manifest at the level of the propagator . </S>",
    "<S> a number of relatively simple parameterizations have been suggested for this propagator in terms of real and complex conjugate poles and branch cuts . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the dominant singularity is real and occurs at a scale @xmath54 to @xmath53  mev . </S>"
