    "the interplay between disorder and interaction in correlated electron materials still remains far from complete understanding @xcite in spite of major progress achieved in disordered but non - interacting electron systems.@xcite on the theoretical side , the main obstacle is the non - perturbative character of the most interesting phenomena , e.g. , alloy - band splitting , anderson localization , or the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition.@xcite on the experimental side , the main problem is that both the amount of disorder and the strength of the interaction are not well controlled and not easily tunable in real condensed matter systems .",
    "the idea of a quantum simulator,@xcite where a complicated quantum many - body system is simulated by another quantum but perhaps simpler system working as a quantum computer , is very attractive .",
    "regarding the interplay between disorder and interaction , experiments with ultracold fermionic or bosonic atoms in optical lattices@xcite are very promising steps toward creating such a quantum simulator and , therefore , are capable of shedding light into this unsettled problem",
    ".    disorder in ultracold gases can be simulated in different ways : ( i ) by using an optical speckle laser,@xcite ( ii ) by superimposing two laser beams with incommensurate frequencies,@xcite or ( iii ) by loading two atomic species , where only one is mobile , into an optical lattice.@xcite the latter simulates a binary - alloy distribution of the on - site energies .",
    "effects of interactions in optical lattices are controlled by tuning the on - site potential depths and/or the magnetic field around a feshbach resonance.@xcite recently developed momentum resolved radio frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy,@xcite on the other hand , is an adequate probing technique of correlated and disordered systems .",
    "this technique is similar to the well - known angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments,@xcite which were performed for alloys in solid - state physics .",
    "rf spectroscopy probes the spectral function and , thereby , the single - particle green s function of the many - body system .",
    "strongly correlated fermions in three dimensions are successfully described within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite this mean - field theory is fully non - perturbative and in combination with density functional theory it is capable of describing properties of real solid - state systems.@xcite an extension of dmft , which includes disorder effects , was performed both , in analogy to the well - known coherent potential approximation ( cpa),@xcite and within a fully stochastic approach to incorporate effects of anderson localization.@xcite since the latter approach is computationally very expensive if one treats correlation effects on a rigorous level and keeps sufficiently large ensembles of disorder realizations , the typical medium theory ( tmt- ) dmft was developed.@xcite here the geometrically averaged local density of states ( ldos ) is used as an order parameter for anderson localization .",
    "tmt - dmft was successfully applied to the non - interacting@xcite and to the interacting@xcite electron systems with disorder .    by construction ,",
    "tmt - dmft is only capable of describing effects of strong localization due to disorder , i.e. , effects caused by fluctuations of the wave - function amplitudes . since tmt - dmft determines the typical ldos , i.e. the most probable value of the ldos , all non - local phase interference effects are missed . to improve the theory such that weak - localization effects in the many - particle wave function are kept",
    ", one should combine a fully stochastic approach with dmft.@xcite in this way one can readopt the original point of view of anderson @xcite and use the full probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the ldos as an order parameter for the anderson transition within dmft .",
    "recently , also the periodic anderson model with disorder was investigated by means of the statistical dmft.@xcite therein , a novel electronic griffith s phase , characterized by non - fermi - liq uid behavior , was established as a precursor of a disorder - driven metal - insulator transition . for non - interacting disordered systems such a stochastic theory , named local distribution ( ld ) approach , was effectively used in an analytical approach@xcite and recently implemented numerically.@xcite    the aims of this paper are to apply the statistical dmft@xcite to interacting and disordered fermions and to extend the method to a level not reached so far .",
    "the theory is applied to correlated fermions on a lattice with binary - alloy type of disorder .",
    "this problem has recently been addressed within dmft combined with cpa to deal with disorder.@xcite it was shown , in particular , that new types of alloy - mott or alloy - charge transfer insulators can appear and that the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition can occur at non - integer particle densities.@xcite here we revisit this model and show that anderson localization significantly extends the picture . in order to make the statistical dmft method computationally feasible",
    "the dmft part is solved approximately within modified perturbation theory ( mpt),@xcite which ( in contrast to , e.g. the slave boson mean - field theory@xcite ) provides a reliable interpolation scheme between the weakly and strongly interacting regimes.@xcite however , a quantitative analysis of the above mentioned griffiths phase is limited by mpt , as this impurity solver does not reproduce the exponentially small low - energy scale for strong interactions .",

    "we have investigated the binary alloy disordered hubbard model within statistical dmft , using mpt as an impurity solver .",
    "this method treats disorder and interaction on equal footing and in a non - perturbative way .",
    "the scheme reduces to the local distribution approach for non - interacting systems and to a standard dmft - mpt scheme in the pure case . applying the statistical dmft",
    ", we were able to compute the full probability distribution function of the local density of states , and therefore , localization effects have been studied in a more rigorous way and in more detail than in a typical medium theory combined with dmft . as a result , the paramagnetic ground state phase diagram was obtained .",
    "it consists of a disordered metallic phase , an anderson - mott insulator , and a band insulator . for non - integer particle density @xmath146",
    "a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition is obtained even when anderson localization effects are taken into account .    in future work",
    ", the method will be generalized to finite temperatures .",
    "it can also be extended to the hypercubic lattice . from the methodical point of view",
    ", it would be desirable to use impurity solvers that are superior or complementary to mpt .",
