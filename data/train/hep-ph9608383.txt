    "the large production cross section of bottom quark pairs ( @xmath7 ) at polarized hadron colliders @xcite coupled with the relatively long lifetime of the @xmath8-quark , implies that detailed experimental study of the properties of the @xmath8-quark at those facilities could also be very useful . since the ckm mixing angle",
    "@xmath9 is close to one , the @xmath8 quark couples rather readily to the virtual top quark in loop diagrams .",
    "now the top quark is so heavy ( @xmath10 gev ) @xcite that the @xmath8-quark becomes very sensitive to electroweak radiative corrections as these corrections often tend to grow with the virtual quark mass @xcite .",
    "precision studies of the @xmath8 s are thus very useful in testing the standard model ( sm ) and in searching for new physics .    in the hadronic environment , while the production cross sections are high , a quantitative understanding of the effects of qcd can be a very difficult challenge .",
    "for this reason , in testing the sm and in searching for clues of new physics , it is perhaps better to focus on observables that tend to be robust to qcd corrections .",
    "for that reason , in general , the production cross section is not a good observable .",
    "we propose to focus instead on signatures of parity violation in @xmath8-quark production since qcd corrections can not generate parity violation .",
    "parity violating asymmetries that are ratios of cross - sections should be less sensitive to qcd corrections as well as to the uncertainties in the parton distribution functions .",
    "furthermore , in study of parity violation , one may be able to make use of polarized incident @xmath11 beams @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on one type of parity violating observable , that is the forward - backward asymmetry . in its differential form",
    ", it is defined as : @xmath12 where the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the forward and the backward hemispheres respectively .    for the reactions of interest to us , i.e. @xmath15 or @xmath16 , we consider two sources of contributions to such a parity violating observable .",
    "these are the chromo - anapole form factor of the @xmath17 vertex ( note @xmath18 ) and the tree level electroweak process @xmath19 . the latter contribution ( @xmath20 exchange )",
    "is significant only when the invariant mass ( @xmath21 ) of the @xmath7 pair is close to the @xmath20 mass ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it can be removed , if necessary , by imposing an appropriate cut on the @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the chromo - anapole form factor is a very important contributor to the parity violating signal and consequently it is our primary focus .",
    "recently , several suggestions have been made to study parity violation asymmetries in polarized hadron collisions for ( 1 ) the production of one jet , two jets , and two jet plus photon in the sm @xcite ; ( 2 ) the production of @xmath23 and @xmath20 in the sm ; and ( 3 ) the inclusive production of one jet with a new handed interaction between subconstituents of quarks .",
    "these works primarily deal with interference of electroweak and strong interactions on light quarks .    in this letter , we present the first study on parity violation generated from one loop weak corrections to bottom quark pair production at polarized hadron colliders .",
    "the key difference with the works in refs .",
    "is , as alluded to in the opening paragraph , that the @xmath7 pair in the final state in our study is a very sensitive tool of the effects of the top quark which in turn is sensitive to non - standard effects .",
    "specifically , we will evaluate the forward - backward asymmetry in the bottom quark pair production at polarized @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders in the standard model and in a two higgs doublet model to examine the effects of parity violation from the interactions of @xmath7 with spin-1 and spin-0 fields .",
    "let us write the @xmath17 vertex as @xmath24 where @xmath25the strong coupling , @xmath26the su(3 ) matrices , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the dirac spinors of @xmath8 and @xmath29 with outgoing momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the momentum of the gluon .",
    "at the tree level @xmath33 . the 1-loop vertex function can be expressed as @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( p_1-p_2)^\\mu [ c(k^2 ) - d(k^2 ) \\gamma_5 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( p_1+p_2)^\\mu [ e(k^2 ) - f(k^2 ) \\gamma_5 ]    \\label{eq : ff1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] current conservation demands that @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath32 and @xmath37 in the @xmath7 center of mass ( cm ) frame . applying the gordon identities we can re - write @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40the chromo - charge ; @xmath41 , @xmath42the anomalous chromo - magnetic moment ; @xmath43 , @xmath44chromo - anapole moment ; @xmath45 , and @xmath46the chromo - electric dipole moment . in the sm ,",
    "the dominant one loop weak corrections that contribute to the chromo - anapole moment arise from diagrams with the @xmath47 and its goldstone counterpart , the @xmath48 . in many extensions of the sm , @xmath49 in models which contain more than one doublets of higgs ,",
    "there are charged higgs bosons ( @xmath50 ) contributing to the chromo - anapole form factor of fermions at the one - loop order . as is well known the simplest of such extensions",
    "consists of two higgs doublets @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath52 with vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "after symmetry breaking , there remain five physical higgs bosons @xcite : a pair of singly charged higgs bosons @xmath55 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath56 ( heavier ) and @xmath57 ( lighter ) , and a neutral cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath58 .",
    "the ratio of the two vevs is usually expressed as @xmath59 .    in our analysis , we have considered such a two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) with the yukawa interactions of model ii @xcite , which is required in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) .",
    "@xcite in this model , one doublet ( @xmath51 ) couples to down - type quarks and charged leptons while the other ( @xmath52 ) couples to up - type quarks and neutrinos .",
    "the one loop weak corrections from diagrams with the @xmath47 , the @xmath48 and the @xmath60 , yield dominant contribution to the b quark anapole moment from the virtual top quark in the loop . in our calculations of these corrections",
    "we will set @xmath61 and also we will ignore cp violating effects . we have employed the t  hooft  feynman gauge for loop calculations with @xmath62 .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath7 production is primarily driven by @xmath63 which is related to the chromo - anapole form factor @xmath64 via @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in fig .  1 we present @xmath63 coming separately from diagrams with the @xmath66 , the @xmath67 and the @xmath20 as well as the total contribution in the sm .",
    "as an illustration of a beyond the sm effect , we also show @xmath63 for thdm for @xmath68 gev and various values of @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath20 boson exchange contribution to the @xmath8-chromo - anapole moment is very small since the coupling product @xmath70 is very small .",
    "the form factor @xmath63 is enhanced near @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , due to the @xmath73 threshold which appears in diagrams with charged boson ( @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath23 or @xmath50 ) exchanges . since @xmath76",
    ", its value is expected to grow with @xmath21 . from fig .  1 we see that numerically this increase sets in for @xmath77 gev .    in the thdm , the form factor @xmath78 gets an additional contribution , @xmath79 , from the charged higgs boson .",
    "clearly @xmath80 is a function of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , being proportional to @xmath83 ^ 2\\}$ ] .",
    "therefore , it has the same sign as @xmath84 for @xmath85 , but has an opposite sign for @xmath86 .",
    "thus the effects of parity violation are enhanced in the thdm if @xmath82 is less than @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the @xmath80 vanishes and the total @xmath78 becomes that of the sm .",
    "let us define the cross section for the sub - process , @xmath89 , in each helicity state of quarks in the initial state as @xmath90 where @xmath91 represents a right - handed ( @xmath92 ) or a left - handed ( @xmath93 ) helicity of the quark and the antiquark .",

    "\\1 ) in our calculations we have retained only the parity violating effects originating from @xmath146 . in principle , gluon fusion , i.e. @xmath147 , can also contribute to parity violation due to electroweak corrections @xcite .",
    "however , dimensional reasoning indicates that such contributions are probably small at lower energy , at least for @xmath148 . in any case",
    ", it is very unlikely that the contribution to the forward backward asymmetry from such a source will cancel away the @xmath100 contribution for all values of @xmath21 .",
    "\\2 ) it would clearly be extremely interesting to consider these parity violating effects in other extensions of the sm ; in particular in the mssm .",
    "as we noted before , in mssm , there will be additional loop contributions not contained in a thdm that could enhance the asymmetry @xcite .",
    "to summarize , at a hadron collider with polarized @xmath0 and @xmath149 gev ( e.g.  rhic ) , parity violation in @xmath7 production will be dominated by @xmath19 . in polarized @xmath113 collisions with @xmath150 gev and enough integrated luminosity , it might be possible to observe parity violation signals from sm weak corrections in @xmath7 production . in the thdm with model ii yukawa interactions , the chromo - anapole form factor of the bottom quark generated from leading weak corrections is enhanced for @xmath69 close to one .",
    "it is enhanced by the factor @xmath151 for @xmath69 less than one .",
    "therefore , the signal of parity violation in @xmath7 production is greatly enhanced for @xmath152 and @xmath81 less than about 300 gev .",
    "production @xcite , is greatly enhanced for @xmath153 . in ref .",
