    "quantum teleportation deals with the transfer of information from one remote location to another without physical transport of the information or measurement on either side to confirm and verify the information content [ 1 ] .",
    "it rests on the quantum correlations for which there are no classical analogues .",
    "bennett and coworkers proposed a theoretical scheme in 1993 using the celebrated bohm - aharanov - einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair and demonstrated the transfer of two bits of information without classical communication with a probability of 1/4 and with classical communication ( with speeds less than that of light in vacuum ) with probability 3/4 [ 2,3 ] .",
    "transfer of the information content of a spin 1/2 particle was thus shown in theory _ with certainty _ and with _ no intermediate observer monitoring / controlling _ the process .",
    "many experiments [ 4 - 10 ] have been performed subsequently which provide partial experimental support for this concept .",
    "a number of remarkable theoretical concepts and schemes have also been invented for single and multi - particle teleportation [ 11 - 18 ] .",
    "the original epr pair which is maximally entangled and played the role of the carrier of information has been supplemented with less - than - maximally - entangled ( with respect to epr pair ) three and four - particle correlated states [ 19 - 22 ] .    some of the difficulties associated with multi - particle teleportation using correlated states are    1 .   maximum entanglement in the same sense as in the case of epr pair can not be achieved under experimental conditions at present .",
    "three or four - particle correlated states often require additional measurement(s ) ( charlie ) as an intermediate step as opposed to a pair of particles .",
    "the use of three - particle maximally entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states for the teleportation of a single particle as quantum carrier and projection basis leads to failure of the process even in theory since four out of eight ghz states have zero projections for the single - particle leading to null results .",
    "this means that it will be impossible for the receiver to reconstruct the unknown state sent by the sender [ 13 ] .",
    "unitary transformations of the ghz states which are robust with respect to tracing of one of the particles and which obviate the need for an intermediate observer have not been examined carefully .",
    "it must be mentioned that bell states are merely unitary transformations from other two - particle states , which , however play a vital role in information processing .",
    "they are different from an unentangled or partially entangled state by a unitary transformation or two .",
    "therefore it is necessary to identify proper , genuinely entangled states for multiparticle teleportation which has not been done in a systematic manner until now .",
    "the extent of correlation between particles which is a direct measure of entanglement is not defined uniformly for multiparticle systems , as against a clear - cut definition for two particle systems [ 23 - 25 ] .    in this article",
    "we address all of the above problems and propose schemes for both optics experiments and using quantum gates .",
    "this article is organized as follows : + ( a ) in section ii different complete set(s ) of orthonormal entangled projection basis of three - particles is ( are ) proposed by using a unitary transformation of ghz basis .",
    "it is shown that in this new basis the observer charlie is not needed and direct teleportation results instead of controlled process .",
    "correlation coefficients are proposed as a measurement criterion for entanglement of multiple paticles using standard ursell - mayer type expansion based on the principles of many body statistical mechanics .",
    "in addition to this , three - particle ghz basis has been used as _ quantum carrier _ as well as _",
    "projection basis _ for single particle teleportation .",
    "+ ( b ) in section iii two different sets of genuinely entangled four - particle states are proposed for the teleportation of an arbitrary two - particle state . the generalization of the same for @xmath0-particle system is also suggested in detail .",
    "+ ( c ) in section iv teleportation using quantum gates and three and four qubit computational bases is described with the appropriate quantum circuit .",
    "this is followed by conclusion .",
    "if we use ghz basis as a quantum channel to teleport unknown information encoded in a single particle then the basis set given by eq . 1 can be used as projection basis and it obviates the earlier difficulties of missing elements of basis set ( when ghz basis functions are used as a projection basis ) .    in this scheme , the single - particle information is with alice , given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "the other three outcomes require one unitary transformation as given in table iii .",

    "our protocol also overcomes earlier difficulties such as getting null results in four out of eight projections performed by alice so that the receiver would never be able to recover the unknown state in four such cases .",
    "gorbachev and trubilko [ 13 ] have shown that , by using a basis which consists of the direct product of a single - particle state with a two - particle entangled state , the teleportation of an arbitrary epr pair can be realized . in their scheme",
