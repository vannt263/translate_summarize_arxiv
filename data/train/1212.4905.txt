    "star formation rate ( sfr ) is one of the most important properties to characterise the growth of a galaxy , and the star formation history of the universe provides us with a fundamental insight into galaxy evolution .",
    "several surveys have been conducted to reveal the star formation activity in the distant universe by making use of various indicators such as ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity , nebular emissions such as h@xmath0and [ oii](@xmath1 ) , and infrared ( ir ) radiation .",
    "these have been used to estimate sfr of galaxies over a wide range of redshifts ; e.g. , uv : @xcite , nebular lines : @xcite , ir : @xcite .",
    "such surveys have revealed that the redshift range @xmath1013 is an essential and intriguing era for the study of galaxy formation and evolution , since star formation rate density ( sfrd ) in the universe gradually increases toward @xmath11 from @xmath126 , has a peak at @xmath1312 , and decreases sharply from @xmath14 toward @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the h@xmath0  luminosity is widely used to derive the star formation activity of galaxies at @xmath16 , but other emission - lines at the bluer end of the galaxy spectral energy distribution , such as the [ oii ]  line , are also sufficiently bright to be widely used and can be employed up to @xmath17 , after being calibrated relative to h@xmath0 . the h@xmath0  emission line is a robust star formation indicator which has been well - calibrated with data in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is significantly less affected by dust extinction than bluer emission lines , such as [ oii ] .",
    "however , the h@xmath0  line is redshifted into near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths for galaxies at @xmath18 , while the [ oii ]  line can be observed with an optical instrument until @xmath19 , and thus many studies / surveys of star - forming galaxies at @xmath18 rely on [ oii ]  luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , while [ oii]luminosity is in general correlated with the star formation activity , it is also dependent on the metal abundance and the ionization state of nebular gas .",
    "the indirect relation with the star formation activity complicates the estimation of sfr from [ oii ]  luminosity . nevertheless , it is empirically calibrated and extensively utilised as a important sfr indicator for galaxies at @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to better relate the [ oii ]  luminosity of a galaxy to its sfr , one can study the ratio of [ oii ]  to h@xmath0  luminosities in local star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , it is not obvious that these calibrations can be blindly applied for galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate their validity at earlier epochs in the universe by studying higher redshift galaxies directly .",
    "according to recent studies , the [ oii]/h@xmath0  ratio of galaxies up to @xmath21 is on average consistent with that of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the [ oii]/h@xmath0  ratio for star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 by using wide - field , deep imaging with two narrow - band filters which can catch h@xmath0  and [ oii ]  emission from @xmath2 galaxies simultaneously .",
    "this study finds relatively little evolution in the line ratio when compared to lower redshift .",
    "however , the detection of both emission lines for galaxies at @xmath22 is limited to relatively luminous galaxies with h@xmath0  luminosity larger than @xmath23 erg  s@xmath4 ( i.e. , sfr @xmath24 10 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 ) , and little is known about the line ratio and nature of the more numerous fainter star - forming galaxies .",
    "fortunately , the [ oii ]  data obtained with the subaru telescope can reach significantly lower luminosities in [ oii]and , using a stacking analysis , the [ oii]/h@xmath0  line ratio can now be studied down to galaxies with significantly lower sfrs .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the data used in this paper are described in   [ sec;data ] . the stacking analysis procedure and the results from the stacked images",
    "are shown in   [ sec;stacking ] . in   [ sec;discussions ] , we show the ratios of h@xmath0  to [ oii ]  luminosities for galaxies at @xmath2 , and compare them with those of local galaxies .",
    "we then discuss their implications with respect to the evolution in dust extinction and metallicity of [ oii]-selected galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in   [ sec;conclusions ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are presented in the ab system , and we adopt cosmological parameters of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the bulk of the data used in this paper have been obtained as part of the high redshift emission line survey ( hizels ) targeting h@xmath0@xcite , and as part of a matched [ oii]follow - up survey @xcite .",
    "the details of the data are described in two papers by @xcite , and therefore we only summarise them briefly here .",
    "( red solid line ) and nb921 ( blue dotted line ) narrow - band filters as a function of redshift which corresponds to the wavelengths where h@xmath0 and [ oii ]  lines are detectable , respectively .",
    "the lower panel shows the bias of observed line ratio of h@xmath0/[oii ]  as a function of redshift , which is caused by the slight differences of filter profiles .",
    "the grey region shows the 1@xmath28 dispersion . since the profile of the nb921 filter is slightly broader , the h@xmath0/[oii ]",
    "ratio can be underestimated for galaxies at the edge of the redshift range where the nb filters can catch the emission lines . however , since most of the galaxies selected with the nb filters are expected to be located at redshifts near the peak of filter profile , it is likely that the difference of filter profiles , which we correct for by 3% , does not significantly influence the measurement of the line ratio . ]",
    "we use two narrow - band imaging datasets to obtain our samples of galaxies at @xmath2 in two distinct square degree areas : the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds : * ? ? ?",

    "they include 188 h@xmath0emitters in the uds down to an h@xmath0  flux of @xmath38 erg  s@xmath4  @xmath39 ( which corresponds to an h@xmath0  luminosity @xmath40(l@xmath41/erg  s@xmath4)=41.78 if the galaxies are at @xmath2 ) and 325 h@xmath0  emitters down to @xmath42 erg  s@xmath4  @xmath39 ( @xmath40(l@xmath41/erg  s@xmath4)=41.56 ) in the cosmos field , respectively .",

    "the redshift coverage for [ oii]lines detected by nb921 filter is a slightly wider than that by nb@xmath29filter .",
    "it is possible that this difference causes us to underestimate the h@xmath0  luminosity for [ oii ]  emitters at redshifts corresponding to the edge of nb@xmath29  filter where the transmission is lower than that of nb921 .",
    "to quantitatively evaluate how accurately the h@xmath0/[oii ]  line ratio can be measured by the two narrow - band images and how this effect may influence the results of the stacking analysis , a simulation was conducted following @xcite ( see  4.5 of their paper for more details ) . in summary",
    ", we make a sample of galaxies at @xmath101.401.52 with intrinsic line ratios between 0 and 2.0 , where the distribution of [ oii ]  luminosity that galaxies have is based on the [ oii ]  luminosity function , and then investigate the measured h@xmath0/[oii]line ratios with the two nb filters .",
    "figure  [ fig;filters ] also shows the result of the simulation : the bias ( i.e. , the difference between a measured h@xmath0/[oii ]  and an input h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio ) is distributed around unity in most of the range of the filter profile , although in the edge of the profile the observed line ratio is biased towards lower values .",
    "however , we make sure that the average value of bias is fairly close to unity . because we focus on the average ratio of h@xmath0/[oii ]  by a stacking analysis in this paper , the slight difference of filter profile",
    "has only a small effect on the results over the whole investigated range of [ oii ]  luminosity . to further quantify this",
    ", we investigate the bias values for galaxies with a given range of _ observed _ [ oii ]  luminosity similar to luminosity bins shown in table [ tbl;oii ] ; we find that the [ oii]-selected galaxies have a redshift distribution peaking at @xmath56 and with most sources having redshifts where the filter response is high , leading to an average value of the bias of @xmath370.97 in all bins , namely close to unity again .",
    "thus , although the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio can be underestimated by 3% ( which we correct for ) , we conclude that the difference of the profiles in the two nb filters gives no significant influence on the results we find in this paper .",
    "stellar masses are estimated by an sed - fitting method for h@xmath0  and [ oii]emitters at @xmath2 in both fields consistently ( sobral et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the details of the procedure in the sed - fitting are described in @xcite .",
    "the sed templates are created with the stellar population synthesis model by @xcite and @xcite under the assumption of a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and a range of exponentially declining star formation histories .",
    "in addition , the dust extinction law of @xcite is used in the sed - fitting . note that we have confirmed that the mass estimates are robust against the contribution of emission lines to the broad - band photometry , as they are based to fits to @xmath57 photometric bands and hence line contamination in one or two bands does not have a strong influence . among [ oii ]  emitters , stellar masses are derived for 2708 ( 99.0%  of the sample ) and 706",
    "( 98.3% ) [ oii ]  emitters in the uds and cosmos field , respectively .",

    "this mass cut is made in order to maximise the number of [ oii ]  emitters included in the sample , but without picking up many lower mass galaxies for which the survey becomes incomplete .",

    "this redshift range is chosen so that the galaxies have small enough apparent angular sizes that most of their light is included in the fibre whilst guaranteeing that the sensitivity is still very high .",
    "an aperture correction on the emission line luminosities is still required , since the spectroscopic measurements are done with 3-diameter fibres . the fractional flux loss from the fibre",
    "is estimated from the ratio of total mass to fibre mass according to the same procedure adopted in @xcite .",
    "moreover , note that the sdss spectrophotometric calibration takes account of any wavelength dependence of the seeing , so the emission line flux ratios are also unaffected by this @xcite .    by applying our selection criteria ,",

    "we are aware that the sdss spectroscopic sample is magnitude - limited , i.e.  roughly mass - limited . however , as described in ",
    "[ sec;stellarmass ] , the criterion of @xmath40(m@xmath60/m@xmath3)@xmath629.5 is applied to both the sdss sample and the [ oii ]  emitter samples at @xmath2 so that high completeness is kept above the mass limit for both samples ; this was another factor driving our choice of redshift range for the sdss sample .",
    "after applying our mass limit we obtain our sdss sample , which contains 7271 galaxies .",
    "the sdss sample is used to compare the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios of [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 with those of local galaxies at @xmath9=0.070.1 in   [ sec;stacking ] and [ sec;discussions ] .",
    "we therefore must assure that both samples are fully comparable and that differences between them are not arising from a different distribution in e.g. stellar mass . since correlations between sfr and stellar mass have been claimed at @xmath63 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is possible that [ oii ]  luminosity as well as h@xmath0  luminosity and metallicity are also correlated with stellar mass for the @xmath2 [ oii ]  emitter samples .",
    "we thus use the sdss sample to construct a sample of local galaxies with a similar distribution of mass to that of [ oii]emitters at @xmath2 in order to reduce any mass - dependent bias on this study and so allow a robust comparison .",

    "we note that @xcite show that small colour - corrections in ( @xmath34nb@xmath29 ) colour are required to trace the underlying continuum level and estimate emission line flux correctly , simply because the nb@xmath29  filter is not in the centre of the @xmath34-band .",
    "we thus performed the correction using the ( @xmath67 ) colour according to @xcite .",
    "the psf in the original nb@xmath29  image has a fwhm of @xmath68 , while that in the @xmath34 image has fwhm of @xmath69 .",

    "images are created by the subtraction of the @xmath34 image from the nb@xmath29  image .",
    "the individual ( nb@xmath29@xmath34 ) images are averaged together to make the stacked ( nb@xmath29@xmath34 ) image for each sample .",
    "the photometry is calculated at the centre of the stacked image with various apertures ranging from 2.0  up to 6.0  diameter .",
    "we note that the photometry with 4.8  diameter aperture is found to recover the total flux of the emission line on the stacked image , and then the ( nb@xmath29@xmath34 ) colour is converted into an emission line flux .",
    "tuned aperture sizes could in principle be dependent on the emission line flux , but we do not find the significant dependence between the size and the luminosity .",
    "thus , we use a common aperture with 4.8  diameter to measure the total fluxes in all samples .",
    "we also note that both h@xmath0  and [ nii ]  emission lines can contribute to this emission flux , but no information of [ nii ]  flux for individual emitters is available .",
    "therefore , we corrected for the contribution of [ nii ]  flux by assuming that [ nii]/h@xmath0  ratio of the emitters is 0.22 @xcite .",
    "the [ nii]/h@xmath0  ratio is known as a indicator of metallicity , and thus it is probably dependent on the stellar mass .",
    "indeed , we find for the sdss galaxies that the [ nii]/h@xmath0line ratio correlates with stellar mass more strongly than with h@xmath0  or [ oii ]  luminosities .",
    "our samples include the emitters with a wide range of stellar mass , but the median stellar mass in each sample only varies by a factor of four , from @xmath70m@xmath3  to @xmath71m@xmath3 .",
    "according to the mass  metallicity relation that @xcite have found for star - forming galaxies at @xmath72 , these median stellar masses correspond to the [ nii]/h@xmath0  ratios of 0.140.25 , which are comparable to or slightly lower than the value we assumed .",
    "even if the lowest ratio of [ nii]/h@xmath0=0.14 is used instead , the h@xmath0  luminosities would be increased by only a factor of 1.07 .",
    "it should be noted that the assumption of constant typical value of [ nii]/h@xmath0  is reasonable , since average h@xmath0luminosities are derived in this study ( see also figure [ fig;haha ] ) .",
    "contamination in the [ oii ]  emitter samples would lead to the h@xmath0fluxes measured on the stacked images being underestimated , since the images without h@xmath0  flux for the contaminants are also stacked . although the bulk of the contaminants are removed using spectroscopic and photometric redshifts and colour cuts (  [ sec;sample ] ) , some contamination will remain . using",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed nb921 emitters , and accounting as best as possible for biases in the selection of spectroscopic targets , the residual rate of the contamination is estimated to be around 15@xmath737% .",
    "more specifically , it is found that the @xmath2 [ oii ]  emitter sample could include @xmath74% contaminations at @xmath75 and @xmath76% ones at @xmath77 ( most of which are galaxies with a strong balmer/4000break at @xmath47 ) .",
    "we have also found that there is no clear trend of the contamination rate with emission line flux .",
    "thus , a correction for our best - estimate of the contamination , 15% , is applied to the stacked fluxes for the [ oii ]  emitter samples in an attempt to account for this .",
    "agns may be included in our emitter samples as contaminants .",

    "the stacking analysis was conducted firstly for h@xmath0  emitter samples .",
    "the analysis for galaxies with h@xmath0  emission detected individually enables us to check our stacking analysis by comparing our results with individually measured h@xmath0  luminosities .",

    "the good agreement shows that our procedure in the stacking analysis recovers well the average of actual individual measurements .",

    "the h@xmath0  luminosity is estimated from the stacked nb@xmath29   @xmath34 image with a 4.8aperture (  [ sec;method ] ) , and the [ oii ]  luminosity is a median value of individual [ oii ]  luminosities of emitters in the sample which are derived from nb921 imaging .",

    "there is a clear positive correlation between the mean [ oii ]  and h@xmath0  luminosities , with almost constant luminosity ratio for [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 .",
    "this fact suggests that the [ oii]luminosity can be easily calibrated as a sfr indicator for galaxies with sfrs down to 1.4 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 , even at @xmath22 .",
    "the distribution of local galaxies extracted from the sdss sample is also shown in the figures , and the median h@xmath0  luminosities are plotted in each [ oii ]  luminosity bin . for @xmath2 [ oii ]  emitters with a given [ oii ]  luminosity , h@xmath0  luminosities are on average lower than those of local galaxies , implying that the ratio of h@xmath0  to [ oii ]  is different between local galaxies and [ oii]emitters at @xmath2 . to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference in h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio",
    ", we compare the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios of [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 with those of local galaxies , calculate how significantly the [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 deviate towards a lower value from the local galaxies in each luminosity bin , and then combine these in quadrature ( using equal weighting ) to give a total offset significance .",
    "we find that there is an overall difference in the line ratio which is significant at the 2.8@xmath28 level .",
    "the systematic offset is intriguing .",
    "it is unlikely that the offset is caused by a difference in stellar mass , since the mass distributions of the two sample are matched to each other (  [ sec;sdsssample ] ) .",
    "possible systematic effects that might drive the offset are discussed in the next sub - section , but are unlikely to be able to account for all of the difference , suggesting a small but genuine cosmic evolution of the mean h@xmath0  to [ oii ]  ratio .      one possible cause of bias towards low h@xmath0  luminosities for [ oii]emitters at @xmath2 with a given [ oii ]  luminosity is contamination in the [ oii ]  emitter samples from emitters at different redshifts which are not removed by our spectroscopic redshift , photometric redshift and colour - colour selection cuts .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec;method ] , a correction for the contamination , 15% , has already been applied to the stacked fluxes .",
    "if the upper limit to the contamination of 22%  is the true contamination , then the calculated h@xmath0  luminosities for the [ oii]emitters can be also underestimated by @xmath377% .",
    "another possibility is that the contribution of [ nii ]  emission is lower than what we assume in this paper as discussed in ",
    "[ sec;method ] .",
    "this effect can result in the underestimation of h@xmath0  luminosity by @xmath377% at most . finally , there is a bias caused by the difference of profile of the two narrow - band filters (  [ sec;nbprofiles ] ) which can lead to the h@xmath0  luminosities being underestimated in the wings of the filter profile .",
    "our simulations have led us to apply a @xmath373% correction factor for this , but these simulations assume a uniform redshift distribution for the [ oii ]  emitters across the redshifts probed . if large - scale structure causes the [ oii ]  emitters to be clustered at the low or high redshift end of the filter coverage , the true correction factor could potentially be a few percent higher .    in order for the h@xmath0  luminosities at @xmath2 to be comparable to those of galaxies at @xmath61 for a given [ oii ]  luminosity , all of the effects that might potentially cause an underestimation of h@xmath0  luminosities would have to be at or above their maximal combined values of @xmath78% .",
    "thus , it is likely that the offset of h@xmath0  luminosities for galaxies with a given [ oii ]  luminosity is real , and the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios of [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 seem to be shifted towards lower values than those of the local galaxies to some extent . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the implication of the different h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio in the properties of galaxies .",
    "/[oii ]  ratios for the sdss sample as a function of the h@xmath0/h@xmath79  ratio .",

    "( d ) same as the lower left panel , but as a function of h@xmath0/h@xmath79 , i.e ,  dust extinction , where the best fitted function shown in the upper right panel is used . ]",
    "as discussed by @xcite , h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios can be dependent on both dust extinction and metallicity , because the two factors both influence the [ oii ]  luminosity more than the h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "therefore , before discussing the line ratios found in the previous section ( figure [ fig;oiiha ] ) , the sdss sample with matched mass distribution is used to evaluate how the two factors of dust extinction and metallicity relate to the ratio of h@xmath0/[oii ]  and to understand which factors are main driver of the difference in the line ratio between [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 and galaxies at @xmath61 .",
    "the balmer decrement of h@xmath0/h@xmath79  is an indicator of dust extinction , while the ratio of [ nii]/h@xmath0 , the so - called n2 index , offers a rough estimator of metallicity .",
    "the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios for the sdss sample described in  [ sec;sdsssample ] are plotted as a function of h@xmath0/h@xmath79  and [ nii]/h@xmath0  in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] , where a polynomial function of the fourth degree is fitted to the data .",
    "the figure implies that the ratio of h@xmath0  to [ oii ]  is dependent on both factors in the sense that it increases with higher dust extinction and higher metal abundance .",
    "it is natural to expect that the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios are sensitive to dust , since a large amount of dust prevents more [ oii ]  emissions at rest - frame 3727  from escaping from the star - forming regions in a galaxy than h@xmath0  emissions at rest - frame 6563 . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath0/[oii ]  line ratio is also dependent on the metallicity as shown in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] .",
    "according to the metallicities estimated from the mass - metallicity relations that recent studies have suggested , the figure suggests that the difference in metallicity between star - forming galaxies at @xmath72 and @xmath61 could account for an offset of @xmath64(h@xmath0/[oii])@xmath80dex .    in reality ,",
    "dust attenuation and metallicity are likely to be correlated . to investigate the independent effect of metallicity on the line ratio , figure [ fig;dustmetal ] also shows the offsets of h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio from the best fitted polynomial function shown in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] , as a function of [ nii]/h@xmath0 , i.e ,  metallicity .",
    "a weak correlation is seen in the sense that the offset of @xmath64(h@xmath0/[oii ] ) gets larger with increasing [ nii]/h@xmath0 , although the dispersion is large . at fixed dust attenuation ,",
    "the difference in metallicity between star - forming galaxies at @xmath72 and @xmath61 suggests an offset of at most @xmath81dex in the mean value of @xmath64(h@xmath0/[oii ] ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that the metallicity is not the major factor on the offset of the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio .",
    "the same suggestion is also obtained with larger sample of sdss data by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , figure [ fig;dustmetal ] shows the offsets of h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio from the best fitted polynomial function shown in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] , as a function of h@xmath0/h@xmath79 .",
    "this figure suggests that the offset is larger with higher dust extinction and the dependence of the offset on the dust extinction seems to be stronger than the dependence seen in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] for metallicity , although dispersion is still large .",
    "this may suggest that dust extinction is the more important factor in changing the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio .      , but the ratio of h@xmath0  to [ oii ]  as a function of [ oii ]  luminosity .",
    "the flux ratios are corrected by 3% for the bias caused by the difference of profile of the two narrow - band filters (  [ sec;nbprofiles ] ) and by 15% for the possible contamination to be included in the sample (  [ sec;method ] ) .",
    "the dotted lines show the ratio of h@xmath0  to [ oii ]  in the case of each dust attenuation in h@xmath0  which is derived from the best - fitted polynomial function shown in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] . ]",
    "the average h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios are plotted in figure [ fig;oiiharatio ] as a function of [ oii ]  luminosity .",
    "we find that they shift slightly towards a lower value at @xmath5 significance than those of galaxies at @xmath61 . according to the results of figure [ fig;dustmetal ] , the ratio of h@xmath0/[oii ]  @xmath82 implies that the typical [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 are not dusty , metal - rich galaxies .",
    "moreover , it is unlikely that the metallicities of the [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 deviate significantly from the mass - metallicity relation that @xcite have found for galaxies at @xmath72 .",
    "that is , it seems that metallicity is not a main cause of the difference in the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio , although we can not completely rule out the possibility that the observed line ratios are in part dependent on the metallicity , as suggested by figure [ fig;dustmetal ] .",
    "we thus discuss the line ratios in terms of the dust extinction .",
    "the lines in figure [ fig;oiiharatio ] show the h@xmath0/[oii]line ratio under the assumption that the ratios are changed due to the amount of dust which is expressed as an attenuation in h@xmath0 , @xmath6(the best - fitted polynomial function shown in figure [ fig;dustmetal ] ) . in this case , all of the h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios for the [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 are distributed around the line corresponding to @xmath6@xmath370.35 , suggesting that [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 are likely to be less subject to dust extinction .",
    "this result is not surprising at all , since [ oii ]  emissions at rest - frame 3727  should be sensitive to dust extinction .",
    "although this is within expectations , it is important to directly confirm with nebular emissions that typical [ oii ]  emitters are on average a less dusty population over the wide range of the luminosity down to @xmath83 erg  s@xmath4 , i.e , sfr=1.4 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 @xcite at high redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , figure [ fig;oiiharatio ] suggests that local galaxies selected based on [ oii ]  luminosity tend to be more subject to dust attenuation compared with [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 .",
    "however , the amounts of dust attenuation are less than a(h@xmath0)=1 ( which is a typical value for h@xmath0  emitters ) in almost all bins of [ oii ]  luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have found that h@xmath0  emitters at @xmath2 shows the average h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratios consistent with those of the local galaxies with a(h@xmath0)@xmath371 .",
    "thus , [ oii ]  emitters are likely to have smaller amount of dust extinction on average than h@xmath0  emitters at both redshifts of @xmath15 and 1.47 , and more interestingly , typical [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 seem to be less dusty than those in the local universe .",
    "recent [ oii ]  emission surveys at @xmath20 have found that there are [ oii ]  emitters with red colours comparable to red sequence on the colour  magnitude diagram .",
    "however , the fact that [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath22 typically show little dust attenuation implies that the red [ oii ]  emitters are likely to be passive galaxies with agn activity in the core of galaxy , not dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "indeed , we confirm that mean h@xmath0/[oii ]  line ratios for [ oii ]  emitters with ( @xmath84)@xmath622.2 are comparable to those for blue [ oii ]  emitters by conducting the stacking analysis in the same manner as described above for the samples classified by the colours .",
    "these results support the similar conclusion on the population of red [ oii ]  emitters found in the galaxy cluster @xmath85 @xcite as well as those in lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the result we have found in this paper highlights that surveys of star formation activity based on only [ oii ]  emissions might result in the underestimation to some extent , because [ oii ]  emission surveys tend to be biased toward less dusty galaxies and therefore will miss the most dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "we investigate the mean relation between h@xmath0  and [ oii ]  luminosities for [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 in the uds and cosmos fields using a stacking analysis which enables us to examine the h@xmath0  luminosity of galaxies at @xmath2 even if the individual galaxies are too faint to detect both h@xmath0  and [ oii ]  emission lines simultaneously .",
    "the [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 are selected with the nb921 narrow - band data taken with suprime - cam on subaru telescope , while the h@xmath0  luminosities are measured on the stacked nb@xmath29  narrow - band data taken with wfcam on ukirt .",
    "we find that on average there is positive correlation between h@xmath0  and [ oii ]  luminosities for not only bright galaxies but also faint ones with [ oii ]  luminosity down to @xmath83 erg s@xmath4 , i.e , sfr=1.4 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 .",
    "the trend that galaxies with higher [ oii]luminosities have higher h@xmath0  luminosities is consistent with that of the local galaxies , suggesting that [ oii ]  luminosities can be used as an indicator of sfr even at the high redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "however , we have to use the [ oii ]  luminosities with caution to estimate sfrs at @xmath2 based on the relation calibrated with local galaxies .",
    "this is because [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 show observed h@xmath0/[oii]line ratios corresponding to @xmath6@xmath370.35 and are less subject to dust attenuation than the local galaxies selected based on [ oii]luminosity .",
    "therefore , [ oii]-selected emitters at @xmath2 are biased toward less dusty populations .",
    "the use of dust - correction relations derived with h@xmath0  emitter samples may cause us to overestimate the amount of dust extinction and hence the dust - corrected sfr . at the same time , surveys of star formation activity based on [ oii ]  emissions may miss populations of dusty starburst galaxies .    on the other hand , we note a caveat to our interpretation of the results in terms of dust extinction only , because the h@xmath0/[oii ]  line ratio is also dependent on the metallicity .",
    "hence the discrepancy of the line ratio between [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 and local galaxies @xmath61 may be explained in terms of metallicity difference .",
    "therefore , the possibility that the low h@xmath0/[oii ]  ratio is not only due to the lower dust extinction , but also the lower metallicities of [ oii ]  emitters at @xmath2 than local galaxies , can not be completely ruled out . to distinguish the two factors of dust extinction and metallicity completely , we require deep spectroscopy to obtain the nebular emissions from the individual or stacked spectra .",
