    "in solid phases , phonons are collective , elementary vibrations in harmonic lattices and as such play a prominent role for physical transport phenomena aplenty @xcite , of which the transport of heat is a most prominent one . in harmonic lattices",
    "these phonons constitute nondecaying , stable propagating waves obeying a dispersion relation for angular frequency @xmath0 and corresponding wavenumber @xmath1 .",
    "this in turn implies that these phonons possess strictly infinite mean free paths ( mfps ) .",
    "consequently , heat transport in harmonic lattices is ballistic @xcite and thus no temperature gradient can be sustained ( breakdown of fourier s law ) .    generally , however , everyday solid materials are far from being perfect harmonic lattices .",
    "therefore , the phonon concept bears no firm basis _",
    "away _ from its underlying ( effective ) harmonic approximation . as pointed out by peierls long ago @xcite , such anharmonicity is essential for umklapp scattering  an indispensable process for a finite , size - independent thermal conductivity @xmath2 in three dimensional ( 3d ) materials .",
    "phenomenologically @xcite , the thermal conductivity is approximated in terms of a wave - number - dependent phonon mfp @xmath3 ; i.e. @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the specific heat of the phonon mode and @xmath6 its phonon group velocity .",
    "principally , we encounter the dilemma that the rigorous existence of a phonon excitation in a nonlinear lattice is self - contradictory to the very existence of a finite mfp . particularly , this concept of a nonlinear or anharmonic phonon may cause considerable unease when dealing with strong nonlinear interaction forces and/or high temperatures where thermal excitations no longer predominantly dwell the harmonic well regions of corresponding interaction potentials .",
    "moreover , the observed breakdown of fourier s law with superdiffusive heat transport in systems of low dimensions @xcite with a thermal conductivity diverging with increasing length of the sample necessitates that some mfps must diverge .",
    "one method addressing the issue is the so termed renormalized phonon picture @xcite .",
    "in essence , this approach uses an effective harmonic approximation of the nonlinear interaction forces via a temperature - renormalized phonon dispersion .",
    "such renormalized phonon theory , however , neither determines the phonon mfp nor a phonon relaxation time ( or , likewise , a phonon lifetime ) .",
    "the problem of finite mfps and corresponding relaxation times thus remains open .",
    "one possibility addressing the missing link consists in combining approximate boltzmann transport theory for heat transport with a single mode relaxation time approximation @xcite .",
    "in fact , while this phenomenological scheme is commonly adopted nowadays , its regime of validity has never been justified from first principles @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the present state of the art is that the physical value for this thermal mfp @xmath7 is evaluated _ indirectly _ only : its evaluation involves both a characteristic relaxation time or lifetime scale @xmath8 and as well a characteristic scale for the phonon speed @xmath9 , yielding @xmath10 .",
    "thus , this mfp is not uniquely given in the sense that various time scales come to mind ; namely , the so termed phonon lifetime ( as obtained from lorentzian fit ) in prior phonon quasiparticle studies in the reciprocal lattice space @xcite , a phonon collision time or transport relaxation time ( notably being not equivalent with the phonon lifetime ) as obtained from a peierls ",
    "boltzmann approach are just but a few @xcite . likewise , the _ a priori _ choice for the speed scale taken as the group velocity is also empirical .",
    " consequently , a direct , molecular dynamics ( md ) based visualization rendering this much sought - after , physically descriptive and useful phonon mfp is highly desirable .    here",
    ", we put forward an experiment - inspired theoretical scheme for propagating anharmonic phonons ( a - phs ) when ubiquitous nonlinear interaction forces are ruling the lattice dynamics .",
    "our main objective is to significantly advance an a - ph concept that simultaneously solves the following challenges : ( i ) the concept can be evaluated by md simulations and additionally allows for the visualization of the physical existence of the a - ph s together with their mfps , ( ii ) the concept is manifest nonperturbative in the strength of lattice nonlinearities , and additionally , ( iii ) the concept is neither restricted to low temperature nor to low frequencies .",
    "to elucidate whether a phonon picture still holds in strongly nonlinear solids we use a `` tuning fork experiment '' as sketched with fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) . here , a tuning fork operating at small driving strength and at a fixed frequency @xmath11 is placed in front of a crystalline , nonlinear lattice slab held at a temperature @xmath12 .",
    "this driving source will generate sound that propagates along the slab . for a phonon picture to hold up",
    ", it is then required that the propagating disturbance physically causes a collective , attenuated plane wave - like response . for the mfp to exist",
    ", the spatially dependent wave amplitude preferably is required to exhibit an exponential decay with a single scale vs increasing spatial spread .",
    "if so , this renders the sought - after mfp for a - ph s in a nonlinear lattice .",
    "the a - ph may still hold up , however , even if the attenuation of the propagating wave occurs non - exponentially , i.e. , when exhibiting multiple spatial scales , see below .    the driving source triggering the thermal phonons must be set sufficiently small so that no nonlinear , non - phonon - like excitations become excited .",
    "this implies that the triggered response of the tuning fork occurs solely within its linear regime , i.e. , the output signal occurs at the same ( driving ) frequency only @xcite .    to realize this stylized experiment , we start with the lattice being held at thermal equilibrium .",
    "we next apply an time - dependent external weak force @xmath13 , see in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) , to the first particle and measure the resulting long time response occurring at all the remaining particles . for the a - ph concept to make sense",
    "this collective response must assume the form of a propagating plane wave , i.e. , the thermally averaged velocity @xmath14 of the @xmath15-th particle is required to read for @xmath16 : @xmath17 with the phase obeying @xmath18 in the expression , @xmath19 denotes the statistical average under the influence of the driving force .",
    "this so parameterized excited motion defines an effective phonon with a frequency @xmath11 that precisely matches the input driving frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath20 , plays the role of the wavenumber @xmath1 . with the amplitude",
    "@xmath21 assumed to decay exponentially as @xmath22 its decay length @xmath7 provides the searched mfp for this a - ph .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we first formulate the concept for one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattices .",
    "the scheme can readily be generalized to higher dimensions and complex materials by applying forces to atoms lying on a chosen lattice plane that trigger either longitudinal or transverse waves which propagate perpendicular to the plane , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : high_d ] .",
    "the 1d lattice hamiltonian assumes the general dimensionless form @xcite : @xmath23}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the momentum and displacement from the equilibrium position for the @xmath15-th particle ( with unit mass ) , respectively , @xmath26 is the inter - particle potential and @xmath27 denotes a possibly present on - site potential . following the common approach we employ the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the role of finite temperature @xmath12 enters by using a canonical ensemble with the unperturbed distribution reading , @xmath28}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the inverse temperature and @xmath30 the canonical partition function .    following the spirit of the `` tuning fork experiment ''",
    ", we then apply a weak single ",

    "therefore , the total hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath32    we can then calculate the thermally averaged velocity at each site @xmath15 using canonical linear response theory @xcite , yielding : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the canonical ensemble average .    for @xmath13 , the excited motion can equivalently be cast into the form of eq . , which involves the fourier transformed susceptibility , i.e. , @xmath35 , \\label{eq : r}\\ ] ] where the susceptibility @xmath36 reads @xmath37    this appealing result allows one to assign the existence of an a - ph and its corresponding mfp : ( i ) an a - ph exists with a wavenumber @xmath38 if and only if the linear relationship in is fulfilled and ( ii ) possesses a unique mfp @xmath39 when @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "importantly , the phonon response amplitude @xmath41 and its phase @xmath42 now both attain a dependence on temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the wavevector is given by @xmath43 .",
    "this very form considerably simplifies the numerical efforts as compared to directly studying the excited waves via the md method , i.e. , one finds the whole frequency - resolved phonon properties at once .    as an expectation , this so introduced a - ph concept should be naturally consistent with the normal phonon in harmonic lattices .",
    "such a fact can be readily tested analytically without invoking the linear response theory , which we demonstrate below . following this",
    ", we give a brief extension of our method to the more general three dimensional case and then move on to the application of our method .      for a harmonic lattice with potentials @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45 , we expect to observe from our method that the mfps are infinite with the wavenumber @xmath1 satisfying @xmath46    to see this , we apply periodic boundary conditions to the lattice so that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . with a periodic driving force",

    "the third column is obtained by cyclically shifting the first column by two elements , and so on . in the formula ,",
    "@xmath66 are the two roots of the quadratic equation @xmath67",
    ". therefore , @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 which can be verified by substitution .    for @xmath70",

    "the plane wave nature also implies the excited waves have infinite mfps .",
    "note that the derivation above is exact and beyond a linear response .",
    "however , it can be shown that applying and to the harmonic lattice will give exactly the same result in and , due to the fact that for harmonic lattices all higher order response terms are actually zero and only the linear response term is present .      in order to generalize our method to higher dimensional cases , we must apply a periodic driving force at the same frequency to each particles in a plane .",
    "taking the three dimensional ( 3d ) case as example , if we want to study the wave propagation along the direction @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the primitive vectors in the reciprocal lattice , we first choose a plane with miller indices @xmath78 , denoted as @xmath79 , being orthogonal to the direction @xmath80 .",
    "then , we apply forces to all particles in this plane . to trigger longitudinal waves , we apply out - of - plane forces that are perpendicular to the plane . to trigger transverse waves ,",
    "we apply in - plane forces .",
    "with such an setup , can be easily generalized to read @xmath81 where @xmath82 means particle @xmath83 is in plane @xmath79 and @xmath84 or @xmath85 which specifies whether the direction of the force and velocity is out - of - plane ( @xmath86 ) or in - plane ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "we now identically set @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the number of particles in that plane ) for all @xmath89 ; then can be simplified to read @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the average velocity for all particles in the plane @xmath79 .",
    "we can further take an average for all particles in the same lattice plane , denoted as @xmath92 , which has the same miller index ( so that it is parallel to @xmath79 ) but contains the @xmath15-th particle .",
    "therefore , we obtain for the average velocity for that very plane the result @xmath93 from this result we can infer whether an anharmonic phonon with a wavevector pointed towards the same direction of @xmath80 exists or not , by following the same reasoning used for one dimensional lattices .    note that the derivation is independent of the form of the hamiltonian @xmath94 .",
    "so the method is equally applicable to study wave transport in inhomogeneous lattices , such as junctions formed by different materials .",
    "we will apply our concept to three archetype 1d nonlinear lattices of varying complexity . before we move on to study these models in detail ,",
    "we first describe the numerical details used to detect the anharmonic phonons .",

    "<S> guided by a stylized experiment we develop a self - consistent anharmonic phonon concept for nonlinear lattices which allows for explicit `` visualization . '' </S>",
    "<S> the idea uses a small external driving force which excites the front particles in a nonlinear lattice slab and subsequently one monitors the excited wave evolution using molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a simultaneous , direct determination of the existence of the phonon mean free path with its corresponding anharmonic phonon wavenumber as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the concept for the mean free path is very distinct from known prior approaches : the latter evaluate the mean free path only indirectly , via using both , a scale for the phonon relaxation time and yet another one for the phonon velocity . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the concept here is neither limited to small lattice nonlinearities nor to small frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is tested for three strongly nonlinear lattices of timely current interest which either exhibit normal or anomalous heat transport . </S>"
