    "indirect dark matter ( dm ) searches aim at seeing an excess in cosmic rays from the annihilation or decay of dm in the galactic halo  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , magic @xcite or veritas @xcite now start to constrain viable dm models and next generation instruments like the planned cta @xcite will be able to dig quite a bit into the underlying parameter space of particle physics models , in a way complementary to both direct dm detection and searches at the cern lhc @xcite",
    ".    very often , indirect searches focus on _ secondary photons _ from the fragmentation of annihilation products , mostly via @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting spectrum is rather model - independent and would manifest itself as a broad bump - like excess over the expected background at energies considerably lower than the dm mass @xmath1 . convincingly claiming",
    "a dm detection based on the observation of such a feature - less signal will generically be difficult .    in many models , however , _",
    "pronounced spectral features _ are expected at the kinematic endpoint @xmath2 include monochromatic gamma - ray lines @xcite , sharp steps or cut - offs @xcite as well as pronounced bumps @xcite .",
    "the type and strength of these features are intricately linked to the particle nature of dm ; a detection would thus not only allow a convincing discrimination from astrophysical backgrounds but also to determine important dm model parameters ( in particular , but not necessarily limited to , the value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "so far , only line - signals have explicitly been searched for  @xcite  despite the fact that they are loop - suppressed and thus generically subdominant compared to other spectral signatures @xcite .    here , we present a general method to search for such features and show that these , indeed , help significantly to discriminate dm signals from astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "this allows us to derive very competitive ( projected ) limits on both the annihilation rate and nature of dm , which we believe will be very useful for dm searches .",
    "the defining aspect of the above - mentioned spectral features in the dm - induced gamma - ray emission is an abrupt change of the flux as function of energy ; in the extreme cases of gamma - ray lines or cut - offs , _ e.g. _ , the corresponding energy range would simply be given by the energy resolution @xmath3 of the instrument .",
    "the basic idea that we will adopt here , following traditional gamma - ray line searches  @xcite , is therefore to concentrate the search for spectral features on a small sliding energy window @xmath4 $ ] , with @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "an important advantage of using small values for @xmath8 is that gamma - ray fluxes with astrophysical origin can often be very well described by a simple power - law . in that case",
    ", a corresponding fit to the data allows an effective determination of the background at the statistical limit , greatly reducing uncertainties related to astrophysical sources .    for deriving constraints on spectral features within the sliding energy window , we will use a binned profile likelihood method  @xcite . to this end , we split @xmath9 $ ] in many energy bins @xmath10 and define a likelihood function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the expected ( observed ) count number in bin @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the poisson probability distribution with mean @xmath16 . introducing the background normalization @xmath17 , its spectral slope @xmath18 and the normalization of the dm signal @xmath19",

    "our main assumption here is that the astrophysical background _ locally _ takes the form of a power law .",
    "obviously , this approximation can break down in case of large window sizes @xmath8 , depending on the collected statistics and , to first order , on the intrinsic curvature of the background flux @xmath29 : a change in the spectral index by @xmath30 , e.g. , implies roughly @xmath31 at the transition point ; @xmath32 could , however , also be affected by systematic uncertainties in @xmath33 .",

    "let us now derive values for the tolerable window size @xmath34 in presence of maximal background curvatures @xmath55 .",
    "using mock data sets with @xmath56 , we compare average dm limits ( on the dm models introduced below ) obtained when using the power - law ansatz for the background with the limits obtained when incorporating a ( fixed ) curvature @xmath32 in the background fit . in fig .",

    "the most striking spectral signature , in terms of a possible discrimination from a power - law background , is a _ gamma - ray line _ at @xmath84 ( @xmath85 $ ] ) , which would result from the direct annihilation of dm into @xmath86 ( @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) @xcite .",
    "generically , for thermal cross sections of dm in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , the annihilation rate is expected to be of the order of @xmath89 , but in some cases much stronger line signals are possible @xcite .",
    "as an example for a step - like feature we use the gamma - ray spectrum @xcite expected from annihilating _ kaluza - klein ( kk ) dm _ in models of universal extra dimensions @xcite . in the minimal version of these models ,",

    "its total gamma - ray annihilation spectrum @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 ) at high energies is dominated by final state radiation ( fsr ) off lepton final states and turns out to be essentially independent of @xmath93 and other model parameters .",
    "pronounced bump - like features at @xmath94 may arise from internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) in the annihilation of _ neutralino dm _",
    "while these spectra are in general highly model - dependent , we follow here a simplified approach by defining two spectral templates @xmath91 ( which we take to be independent of @xmath1 ) by referring to neutralino benchmark models introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", bm3 is a typical example for a neutralino in the stau co - annihilation region , where photon emission from virtual sleptons greatly enhances @xmath91 ; bm4 refers to a situation in which ib from @xmath95 final states dominates .",
    "we note that the sommerfeld effect could strongly enhance these features , in particular in the case of bm4 , in the same way as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for line signals .    .",
    "dashed lines show the same spectra , smeared with a gaussian of width @xmath96 to give a rough indication of how well a detector with such an energy resolution would in principle be able to discriminate these models from astrophysical ( power - law ) backgrounds , as well as from each other . ]        in tab .",
    "[ tab : dm ] , we shortly summarize the properties of the dm benchmark models described above , including for completeness the actual dm mass and total annihilation rate needed to obtain the observed relic density for thermally produced dm .",
    "note , however , that we essentially treat these values as free parameters in our analysis and that we are rather interested in the spectral shape of the annihilation signal , represented by @xmath91 ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmspectra ] we show these spectra for a direct comparison .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : cs ] we show our results for the expected @xmath97 upper limits ( thick lines ) on the above dm models as well as the variance of these limits among the @xmath98 mock data sets that we created for this analysis .",
    "we find that in particular ib features in the spectrum ( right panel ) have the potential to constrain the annihilation rate at least down to values typically expected for thermal production , @xmath99 , already for modest assumptions about the dm distribution ( we verified that nfw and einasto profiles give similar results ) .",
    "this is very competitive compared to the best current limits from acts that only rely on secondary photons @xcite  though we would like to stress that these limits provide rather complementary information on the dm nature and can thus usually not easily be compared .    for the case of not too strongly pronounced endpoint features ( like line signals in most models or the step for kaluza - klein dm ) ,",
    "secondary photons will usually be more powerful in constraining the total annihilation rate @xmath77 ; from the point of view of indirect dm searches , however , the _ detection _ of the kinematic cutoff will be much more interesting than the detection of secondary photons since it allows to draw firmer conclusions about the dm origin of the signal and even to determine important parameters like @xmath1 . for models with very large ib contributions like bm3 ,",
    "on the other hand , we find that our method provides even stronger _ limits _ on @xmath77 than what was obtained by the hess analysis of the galactic center region assuming annihilation into @xmath100 @xcite .    in case of an adiabatically compressed profile our limits could improve by two orders of magnitude , as demonstrated for gamma - ray lines in the left panel ; under such conditions",
    ", one could even hope to constrain models with very small annihilation rates like bm3 ( recall that the annihilation rate for bm4 is anyway affected by the sommerfeld enhancement @xcite and thus likely considerably larger than what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] ) . as shown in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] , the future cta should be able to place limits about one order of magnitude stronger than currently possible , and the proposed dma could further improve these by another factor of ten .",
    ", the statistics actually become so good that a spectrum with @xmath101 curvature starts to deviate significantly from a power - law background already for rather small sliding energy windows . in order to obtain reasonable limits",
    ", we therefore included @xmath102 as a free parameter in the fit to allow for energy windows somewhat larger than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : windowsize ] . ]",
    "when probing a specific dm model , the corresponding @xmath50 is a good measure for the level on which spectral artefacts in the energy reconstruction of the instrument must be understood . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] ( thin lines ) , most of our derived limits correspond to moderate @xmath50 values of at least a few percent ( except for iact3 ) , which should be well in reach of current instruments .",
    "limits on gamma - ray lines as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] are usually derived _ neglecting _ any secondary gamma - ray component from dm annihilation  @xcite ; this approximation , however , breaks down for very small branching ratio into lines since part of the secondary component will leak into the sliding energy window . assuming a dominant annihilation into @xmath103 final states",
    ", we find that for branching ratios into gamma - ray lines smaller than @xmath104 , the presence of the secondary flux begins to alter the derived gamma - ray line limits significantly .",
    "this renders a naive application of standard line - search results on dm models with generic @xmath105 branching ratios into gamma - ray lines questionable  @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] show the projected _ sensitivity _ to see a @xmath28 signal in the iact2 scenario ( neglecting systematics and trial factors ) .",
    "such an observation should of course be cross - checked by the non - observation of the same signature in control regions without large dm induced fluxes .",
    "a more detailed analysis for detectional prospects is beyond the scope of the present work and left for a subsequent publication  @xcite .",
    "gamma rays from dm annihilation often exhibit pronounced spectral features near photon energies close to the dm particles mass . here",
    ", we have shown that methods from gamma - ray line searches , which greatly reduce the uncertainties related to astrophysical background fluxes , can successfully be extended to look for such spectral features ; this provides a probe of the dm nature that is complementary to dm searches relying only on the rather model - independent spectrum from secondary photons .",
    "while these kind of features may generically be considered even more relevant for the _ detection _ of dm signals , because they would provide rather unambiguous evidence for the dm nature of the signal as well as allow to determine important parameters like the dm mass , we have demonstrated here that including the spectral information may even significantly improve _ limits _ on dm signals ; steps or bump - like ib features can , in fact , be much more important in this respect than lines .",
    "we stress that while we have considered constraints for iact observations of the galactic center region , the presented method is much more general and can be applied to both other targets and other instruments ; we thus expect it to be useful for a wide range of applications in indirect dm searches .",
    "an obvious extension of the approach presented here , finally , is to apply it to the detection rather than exclusion of dm signals , as well as to the _ discrimination _ of models @xcite .",

    "<S> gamma rays from the annihilation of dark matter particles in the galactic halo provide a particularly promising means of indirectly detecting dark matter . here , we demonstrate that pronounced spectral features at energies near the dark matter particles mass , which are a generic prediction for most models , can significantly improve the sensitivity of gamma - ray telescopes to dark matter signals . </S>",
    "<S> we derive projected limits on such features ( including the traditionally looked - for line signals ) and show that they can be much more efficient in constraining the nature of dark matter than the model - independent broad spectral features expected at lower energies . </S>"
