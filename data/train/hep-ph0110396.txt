    "one of the major objectives of run  2 at the tevatron is to search for the higgs boson in the mass range of @xmath1 to @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "global analyses of lep1 electroweak data have considerably narrowed down the sm higgs boson mass  @xcite , and prefer a low mass higgs boson . at tevatron energy ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the dominant mechanism of sm higgs boson production is @xmath5 with a cross section ranging from @xmath6 for @xmath7 to @xmath8 for @xmath9 . for @xmath10",

    "form @xmath13 , the @xmath14 decay mode becomes dominant , and the detection of the higgs boson is promising via this mode .",
    "the detection via @xmath15 decay mode has not been thoroughly studied and may be on the borderline  @xcite . in the usual scenario ,",
    "the best way to observe the signal of the sm higgs boson for @xmath10 is the production of @xmath16 via @xmath17 and the subsequent decay @xmath18 , where the background can be controlled using appropriate cuts .",
    "however , if @xmath18 is not the dominant decay ( as in the scenario we shall propose ) , this signal may be significantly lowered , making the detection in this channel very difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath19 coupling is significantly enhanced , higgs boson production through gluon fusion may be large enough to detect a signal via the @xmath15 decay mode for the low mass region ( @xmath10 ) , or the signal in the @xmath20 decay mode could be large enough to detect in the higher mass range ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the object of this work is to explore an alternative scenario in which the @xmath19 coupling is significantly enhanced , and how that alters the higgs boson search strategy at tevatron run  2 due to the changes of the relative importance of its various production and decay modes .    in the minimal sm",
    "the higgs boson has a small coupling to two gluons , generated only at one - loop level , a fact that makes its discovery difficult on hadron colliders . in extensions to the sm various higgs - like scalars",

    "we point out that appropriate new physics can generate an enhancement to this coupling even if mechanism of electroweak breaking is left intact .",
    "the additional interactions present in such models are _ not required _ in order to explain ew breaking , but they can not be excluded either .",
    "such scenarios must be taken into consideration because they have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "such an enhancement arises if the higgs boson mixes with a @xmath0 bound state .",
    "such a state is not formed in the minimal sm because the top quarks would decay before the strong interaction could bind it system are small .",
    "approximating the qcd effects by a coulomb potential , we would find a bound state whose revolution time  @xcite is @xmath21 . because the top quarks constituting the bound state have a decay width @xmath22 , the would - be bound state decays before even one revolution . ]",

    "the exchange of a new gauge boson would generate a large contribution to the @xmath26 coupling unless suppressed by @xmath27 . ]",
    "we denote by @xmath28 a hypothetical @xmath0 bound state that mixes with the higgs boson . in spectral notation",
    "referring to the @xmath0 system this state must be a  @xmath29 state ( to ensure even parity and zero spin . )",
    "such a bound state must be held together by new interactions , whose strength , @xmath30 , must be much larger than @xmath31 to form a bound state at all .",
    "they must act only on the third family ( otherwise they would have already been detected in processes such as @xmath32 at the tevatron . )",
    "the dangerous place is the @xmath26 vertex , where one loop corrections , due to the exchange of the new gauge bosons might have a large effect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrections ] . at the tevatron",
    ", only the @xmath0 production cross section will be affected .",
    "this cross section is known with a @xmath33 precision , and the effect is , so we would prefer a new interaction effective at scales much above  @xmath34 .    in this paper",
    "our goal is not to build a specific model .",
    "nevertheless we point out that the new interactions , being chiral , will be very different from a scaled - up copy of qcd .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that the standard way of calculating quarkonium decays , nonrelativistic qcd  @xcite , is not applicable here ( the size of the nrqcd operators are determined by qcd dynamics . )",
    "we ll do a potential model calculation instead .",
    "we use a yukawa potential to model the @xmath0 interaction and argue that the strength of the yukawa potential will be related to @xmath30 , and that the screening length  @xmath35 is related to @xmath36 .",

    "[ sec : mixing ] we work out the general formalism of the mixing between a light higgs @xmath11 and the @xmath28 , and show that , with the exception of a small part of the parameter space , the gluonic branching ratio of the higgs is determined directly by the gluonic branching ratio of the @xmath28 and also by the masses of the @xmath11 and @xmath28 ( and is _ independent _ of any mixing parameters . )",

    "we find that , in order for a  @xmath29 state to form and not to have a too wide @xmath37 width , the interaction strength is restricted to be between @xmath38 , while the screening mass can still exceed @xmath39 .",
    "however , in such a case the binding of the @xmath40 states is so deep that their masses become negative .",

    "nuclear physics is witness that strong interactions , even nonchiral , may generate very strong @xmath41 couplings .",
    "a spin - orbit interaction that binds states with negative values of @xmath41 stronger , can lead to a situation when the only bound state that is formed is @xmath42 , as we show in a numerical example .",
    "we do not think that a one - loop calculation of the relative strengths of the spin independent and the @xmath41 terms in the potential is reliable , so that we handle this ratio as an unknown input parameter . )",
    "effects and/or relativistic corrections may also induce a mixing between the higgs boson and the @xmath43 state . at tree level",
    "such mixing is absent and the interaction is repulsive in the singlet and attractive in the triplet channel which does not allow the formation of a @xmath43 state .",
    "this conclusion may be incorrect though when higher orders are incorporated . ]    in sec .",
    "[ sec : modif ] we argue that the presence of such mixing can lead to the enhancement of final states with two gluons from higgs decay in lepton colliders .",
    "a large @xmath44 branching ratio can lead to a _ decrease _ of the @xmath18 signal , dominant in the minimal sm , and this can adversely affect higgs searches in @xmath45 colliders . on hadron colliders",

    "( [ eq : br ] ) we see that the term containing the parameter @xmath75 plays only a minor role ( disregarding the exceptional case when a cancellation occurs in the denominator ) , and this fact justifies the approximation in the last line .",

    "both of these cases are hardly conceivable .",
    "most probably , the mixing will be large enough for the unity in the denominator of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : br ] ) to dominate . in that case , the observed higgs branching ratio is _ independent _ of the mixing angles , @xmath83 .",
    "the physical reason for this is that both @xmath44 and @xmath18 are dominated by the decay through mixing , @xmath84 .",
    "we estimate the properties and decay widths of the @xmath28 particle in a potential model with a yukawa potential .",
    "this particular framework is not necessarily realized in nature but we remind ourselves that all we want is an existence proof for a situation where this @xmath28 might exist .",
    "the advantages of such a potential are : ( 1 ) it has two parameters , both of which can be reasonably closely related to parameters of the underlying theory ( a new gauge coupling @xmath30 and a new symmetry breaking scale @xmath85 ) , and ( 2 ) that the introduction of @xmath86 coupling allows for a low lying @xmath29 state , while all other states become heavy or nonexistent .",
    "we use such a potential model to calculate the toponium spectrum , to restrict the new coupling strength and screening mass , and to find the decay widths of the @xmath28 .",
    "especially , we use the usual potential model expression that relates the decay rate @xmath87 to the derivative of the radial wave function at the origin . to find these quantities we need to calculate the wave function of a particle moving in a yukawa potential .",

    "the first shell with only s - wave states feels a different , weaker potential with @xmath100 .",
    "if the potential is dominated by the spin - orbit interaction , the binding energy of the @xmath40 states can be made small . because the screening parameter is also affected by the new @xmath101 ( while the screening mass @xmath102 remains unchanged ) ,",

    "[ sec : modif ]    we have shown an example when the mixing of the standard model higgs boson with a new heavy scalar introduces significant changes in the couplings of the higgs , most notably leading to a sizable , perhaps dominant , higgs - gluon interaction . in the higgs mass region",
    "@xmath104 that we are considering , this changes the relative importance of the various production channels as well as the decay modes .",
    "this alters the strategy needed to discover the higgs boson in a significant way , both at the hadron and lepton colliders .    in future leptonic colliders",
    "the environment is favorably clean for the detection of the higgs .",
    "the  gold plated \" mode @xmath105 followed by the higgs decay @xmath106 seems to be the easiest to see .",
    "the mixing discussed in this paper would increase the @xmath107 plus two gluon jets final state .",
    "a large @xmath108 branching ratio arises if the new scalar @xmath28 dominantly decays into two gluons .",
    "this would diminish the @xmath109 signal so that the higgs might be missed altogether in searches for a standard higgs .",
    "this is also important for the lep2 data with the search restricted to @xmath110 two @xmath111-jets .    at tevatron",
    "run  2 , the most promising mode for the sm higgs boson in the mass range @xmath112 is @xmath113 .",
    "however , in our scenario , the dominant decay mode of @xmath11 may be @xmath44 , thus reducing the @xmath18 branching ratio .",

    "the higgs production in the mode @xmath5 will be greatly enhanced in this scenario .",

    "the mode @xmath117 was a borderline case in the sm",
    ". with the enhanced @xmath5 production rate of our scenario , the signal in this mode may be observable if the @xmath118 detection efficiency and the missing @xmath119 resolution can be improved in the upgraded cdf and d0 detectors .    in the sm , @xmath120",
    ", while @xmath121 for @xmath122 . in our scenario , the higgs branching ratio to two photons will be increased , and so will be the @xmath123 production cross section .",
    "thus , the two photon mode may be detectable at tevatron run  2 .",
    "a similar enhancement will occur for the two photon mode at the lhc .    while in most of this paper we discussed the case of a light higgs boson , it is worthwhile to point out that in the case of a heavy higgs ( @xmath124 , when the dominant decay is @xmath125 ) the qcd background is less severe on hadronic colliders",
    ". then gluon fusion is the dominant process in the standard model , @xmath47 , providing an excellent signature .",
    "this signal will be greatly enhanced in the proposed scenario .",
    "we have presented a scenario in which the coupling of the sm higgs boson to two gluons can be greatly enhanced due to mixing with a scalar @xmath0 bound state ( bound by new strong interactions ) .",
    "we have presented a potential model in which such a scenario may be realized .",
    "such a scenario has major implications for the higgs search at tevatron run  2 in the mass range of @xmath126 .",
    "production and decay channels are both affected .",
    "the @xmath114 final state at tevatron run  2 will be suppressed , because the @xmath18 branching ratio is suppressed . the @xmath20 mode will be enhanced due to an increase in the @xmath127 production cross section , so that this mode will be effective even for a higgs mass range lower than @xmath128 . because higgs production via @xmath5 mode is enhanced , the @xmath15 and perhaps also the @xmath129 final states may be detectable .",
    "finally , we point out that lep2 may have missed the higgs boson because the dominant final states were @xmath130 instead of @xmath109 .    after the completion of this paper another work was published  @xcite , which discusses a similar effect on the gluonic couplings of the higgs boson .",
