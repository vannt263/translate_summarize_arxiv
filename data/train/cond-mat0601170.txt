    "electromagnetic waves are in general described by an expression such as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 stands for the global phase signal definition of monochromatic forward propagating waves",
    ". both choices of phase signal ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) are allowed and both can be founded in several theoretical approaches of the x - ray diffraction phenomenon in crystals .",
    "physically measurable quantities are invariant regarding two distinct and independent choices : one is the choice on how to describe the forward propagating x - ray wave , represented here by the options @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; and the other is the choice of origin for the spatial position @xmath8 . in the literature of x - ray diffraction ( see for instance refs .  ) these two distinct choices have been of particular relevance for deriving important mathematical expressions , such as those of the structure factor of a crystal unit cell and of the atomic form factor . whatever is the chosen option , @xmath3 ,",
    "it can be compensated by the choice of origin so that the expressions are obtained in their standardized format without showing any dependence to the phase signal option .",
    "this standard procedure links the choice of origin to the choice of phase signal , which is unreal since both choices are independent from each other .",
    "the real fact is that the available expressions are in agreement with only one value of @xmath9 for each given choice of origin .",
    "consequently , the propagating waves in the medium must be described according to the implicitly undertaken choices , otherwise measurable features such as the positioning of standing wavefields formed inside crystals undergoing diffraction   as well as invariant phase values accessible via @xmath10-beam diffraction experiments @xcite   will be affected by conflicting definition of the global phase signal .    , regarding an arbitrary choice of origin at @xmath11 , is given in terms of incident @xmath12 and scattered @xmath13 wavevectors since @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as demonstrated in eq .",
    "( [ phasediff ] ) . for sake of simplicity in analyzing the dependence with the global phase signal @xmath9",
    ", the origin is chosen very far from the charge - density distribution @xmath16 , to asssure that @xmath17 would have the same signal , in our case positive , for any point @xmath18 where @xmath19.,width=307 ]    in this work the conflicting points are demonstrated and commonly used expressions in x - ray crystallography are generalized for any preference of signal choice @xmath9 .",
    "signal shifts owing to geometrical factors are avoided by choosing the origin further way from the diffracting volume .",
    "the consequences only on the choice of @xmath9 is then exploited and discussed in the rest of the paper . moreover , to facilitate part of the demonstration , an adaptation of the stokes relations for bragg reflection in perfect low - absorbing crystals is presented .",
    "as depicted in fig .",
    "1 , the scattered wave @xmath20 towards direction @xmath13 depends on the relative phase between the rays from the origin @xmath11 and from the electron density at any given position @xmath8 , as for instance at @xmath18 . in the wavefront @xmath21 , @xmath22}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 } = \\delta{\\bm d}_oe^{i\\varphi}.\\ ] ] since the origin has been chosen outside the electron density distribution @xmath16 , there is no scattering at the origin , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "also , the origin was chosen in a such way to guarantee that @xmath25 to all positions inside the volume where @xmath19 , hence    @xmath26 and    @xmath27    the choice - of - origin phase @xmath28 , is common to all elements of volume @xmath29 at any instant of time , and can be conveniently chosen to provide @xmath30 . if @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the scattering amplitude of a single electron ) , the total scattered wave by the volume v is    @xmath33    in x - ray crystallography , the structure factor @xmath34 corresponds to the total scattered wave from an unit cell , which is @xmath35  ( @xmath36 is the unit cell volume ) .",
    "therefore , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ scatwave ] ) that    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the diffraction vector of reflection h , and @xmath40 is the atomic form factor @xcite of the atom at the position @xmath41 in the unit cell .",
    "the step from eq .",
    "( [ scatwave ] ) to eq .",

    "a comparable reflection coefficient at all depths is assumed , i.e. @xmath73 do not depend on @xmath45 .",
    "all dependence with depth is accounted for @xmath74 , which is a smooth function with very small variation over the lattice period .",
    "the standing wavefield is therefore @xmath75 whose time - average intensity at any depth is proportional to    @xmath76    providing antinodes ( maxima of intensity ) at @xmath77 for every integer value of @xmath78 .    for sake of simplicity , a single atomic layer per lattice plane period",

    "reflection intensities only provide @xmath131 as experimental data input for @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ rhoc2eqn ] ) .",
    "then , what phase @xmath63 should be assigned to the structure factor @xmath132 of each crystal reflection ?    for decades , great effort has been dedicated in developing and improving methods to estimate reflection phases , but since these are relative choice - of - origin values , the estimable quantities are in fact the differences among reflection phases , better known as phase invariants @xcite . for instance , consider three reflections @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 whose diffraction vectors fulfill the condition @xmath136 . hence , in the structure factor ratio @xmath137 the triple phase @xmath138 is invariant regarding the choice of origin in fig .  1 .    three - beam diffraction experiments  @xcite are sensitive to @xmath139 .",
    "in azimuthal scan mode , the diffracted intensity of reflection @xmath133 is modulated by the excitation of the reflection @xmath134 during the crystal rotation @xmath140 around @xmath141 .",

    "although the signal of @xmath146 changes with @xmath9 , the invariance of @xmath147 is assured by the cosine , an even function .",
    "however , both angles must stand for the same choice of @xmath9 in eqs .",
    "( [ sfactor ] ) and ( [ phdeqn ] ) .",
    "otherwise , the experimental determination of @xmath139 by @xmath140-scan data analysis would be compromised .",
    "besides the signal of @xmath139 , its modulus will also change with @xmath9 when the @xmath148 and @xmath149 corrections @xcite of the atomic form factor the so - called anomalous scattering corrections   are taken into account . according to the structure factor expression in eq .",
    "( [ sfactor ] ) @xmath150 and then @xmath151 and @xmath152 when @xmath153 .",
    "it is unacceptable since these inequalities would imply in different diffracted beam intensities for each possible choice of wave representation , @xmath7 or @xmath6 .",
    "to avoid such artificial fact , the @xmath149 correction must bear its depence with @xmath9 , so that @xmath154",
    "structure factor , dynamical phase shift , phase invariants , and complex atomic form factor are values susceptible to the choice of global phase signal , as explicitly demonstrated here .",
    "when a measurable quantity depends on more than one of these values , they must be calculated for the same choice of phase signal .",
    "recursive equations based on stokes relations are applied for calculating the reflectivity of low - absorbing crystals with a finite number of lattice planes .",
    "these recursive equations are extremely simple and , yet , capable of describing important features of the diffraction phenomenon such as kinematical diffraction ( thin crystals ) , primary extinction ( maximum reflectivity equal to 1 ) , intrinsic width of bragg reflections in either kinematical or dynamical diffraction regimes , and the phase shift of the diffracted waves across the reflection domain .",
