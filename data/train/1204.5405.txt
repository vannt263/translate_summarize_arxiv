    "understanding ground states of interacting quantum systems is one of the central defining challenges of condensed matter physics . on the one hand ,",
    "quantum field theory is a powerful and general framework for studies of low - energy properties of complex , strongly correlated and entangled quantum matter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this continuum approach has potential pitfalls due to its generality , and limitations due to its insensitivity to lattice scale physics , making it important to also carry out direct studies of microscopic lattice hamiltonians .",
    "a fruitful direction is to combine the advantages of both methods by analyzing data from unbiased numerical investigations of lattice hamiltonians with quantum field theoretic predictions of emergent low energy properties .",
    "such connections between the two approaches can have significant synergistic effects in advancing our understanding of quantum many - body phenomena  as they have had and continue to have in classical statistical mechanics , especially in studies of thermal phase transitions @xcite .",
    "computational many - body research faces important challenges since the quantum models of interest are often beyond the reach of existing algorithms .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) and 3d frustrated quantum spin systems and fermion systems are the main groups of difficult systems , since they suffer from the infamous `` sign problem '' in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the sign problem arises when the weight function in the configuration space constructed using the euclidean path integral or other mappings to an effective statistical - mechanics problem is not positive definite , hence invalidating the interpretation of the weights as a probability distribution for importance sampling .",
    "the approach we advocate and review here is to construct particular `` designer hamiltonians '' , which host interesting ground states and quantum phase transitions but still are amenable to large - scale qmc studies without sign problems ( i.e. , they are designed and `` de - signed '' to be practically useful ) .",
    "a common misconception is that interesting designer hamiltonians should not exist  if a model is sign - problem free it must be trivial or uninteresting . in this article , we will review some recent counter - examples to this pessimistic view , from the area of quantum magnetism .",
    "moreover , advances in qmc methods @xcite have made it possible to truly approach the low - energy limit of many important models without any approximations ( beyond controllable statistical errors ) , and to compute quantities of current interest in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory , e.g. , the fidelity @xcite , the geometric tensor @xcite , and the entanglement entropy @xcite . we will briefly address some of these technical developments as well .",
    "we first make some further remarks on field theory and the philosophy of the synergistic use of designer hamiltonians , and then outline the topics covered in this review .",
    "the natural starting point for theoretical models of condensed matter systems are microscopic hamiltonians",
    ". an effective field theoretic description of a given hamiltonian is constructed based on a combination of insights and assumptions on the properties of the hamiltonian that control the long distance physics according to the renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "these properties most famously include symmetry and dimensionality , but more subtle effects like the nature of the topological defects also play an important role .",
    "the fixed points of the field theory control the long distance physics .",
    "the rg approach may result in flows to a previously known fixed point , or to some fixed point whose properties are not known .",
    "the rg itself often relies on approximations that are not easy to justify , and , if the flow is to some unknown state , it is challenging to characterize it .",
    "often to control the rg flows , analytic expansions around some special simplifying limits are considered .",
    "well known examples are the @xmath4 expansion around the upper critical dimension and the @xmath5 expansion in the number of components @xmath1 ( spin components , flavors of fermions , etc . )",
    "the extrapolation to the @xmath4 or @xmath1 of interest is often problematic , however , because only low - order expansions are feasible in practice  or worse still , the expansion may not converge at the value of @xmath4 or @xmath1 of primary interest .",
    "one example of the above approach of deriving effective field theories from microscopic hamiltonians by a limiting expansion is the @xmath6-dimensional nonlinear @xmath7-model description of interacting quantum spins in @xmath8 dimensions , which was derived by haldane in the semi - classical limit of large spin @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "another example  central to this review article  is the non - compact cp@xmath10 description of the intriguing nel to valence - bond solid ( vbs ) `` deconfined '' quantum - critical point in 2d su(@xmath1 ) quantum magnets , which can be justified in the large-@xmath1 limit @xcite . whether or not the theory remains correct down to small @xmath1 , in particular @xmath11 , remains a challenging question .    in view of the uncertainties with analytic methods highlighted above ,",
    "it is important to test the predictions of field theories in some unbiased way , starting from a microscopic description of the system or phenomenon of interest .",
    "in some cases there are exact solutions , e.g. , the bethe ansatz solution of the @xmath12 heisenberg chain @xcite has been crucial for testing the non - linear @xmath7-model description of this class of critical spin chains .",
    "the exact aklt state @xcite for a special version of the @xmath13 chain was similarly important in confirming haldane s conjecture of the qualitative differences between half - odd integer and integer spins @xcite .",
    "exact solutions are rare , however , and mostly limited to 1d models .",
    "another , more general approach is to study hamiltonians numerically .",
    "exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian is possible only for very small systems ; currently up to @xmath14 @xmath12 spins @xcite .",
    "white s density matrix renormalization ( dmrg ) scheme @xcite and related approaches based on matrix - product states @xcite have enabled more detailed studies of the low - energy physics of 1d systems , including also `` ladders '' of several coupled chains @xcite .",
    "qmc studies are also competitive in 1d in the absence of sign problems @xcite .",
    "while there has been some progress for 2d systems with dmrg @xcite and tensor - product @xcite states , which are higher - dimensional generalizations of the matrix - product states generated in dmrg @xcite , in general these methods have not yet reached the point where one can obtain unbiased results for generic nontrivial models .",
    "there are encouraging developments , however , of calculations addressing challenging systems and approaching the level of accuracy where definite conclusions can be drawn @xcite .    presently , however , the only numerical approach with which one can routinely reach sufficiently large 2d and 3d lattices in a completely unbiased way is qmc simulations @xcite ; but , as already noted , they are restricted to systems free from sign problems .",
    "the class of models for which the sign problem is either absent or evadable still contains a vast range of hamiltonians with non - trivial and interesting ground states and quantum phase transitions . to study low - energy emergent properties ,",
    "the interactions do not necessarily have to correspond in detail to any particular real material  although some times that is also possible @xcite .",
    "the idea is to design a sign - problem free hamiltonian in such a way that it contains a particular macroscopic ( low - energy ) phenomenon of interest  so that universal physics is captured .",
    "bench - mark results obtained from such designer hamiltonians , representing various physical phenomena in a prototypical manner , can be very useful experimentally . here",
    "our main focus will be on the theory side . with unbiased large - scale qmc simulations , one can test field theories proposed to capture specific classes of quantum many - body states or quantum phase transitions .",
    "moreover , explorations of designer hamiltonians can also serve as `` experiments '' for discovering novel phenomena , and , thereby , stimulate further theoretical developments .",
    "a designer hamiltonian corresponds to an effective classical statistical - mechanics problem ( with a real action ) , which arises out of the construction of the sampling space in the qmc scheme implemented . in some cases quantum phenomena in @xmath8 dimensions",
    "can be studied using monte carlo simulations with the simplest generalization to a classical model with the same global symmetries in @xmath15 dimensions @xcite ( e.g. , the thermal phase transition of the 2d classical ising model is in the same universality class as the quantum phase transition of the transverse - field ising chain @xcite ) .",
    "often , however , the effective classical model resulting from the construction of a qmc configuration space , in a complete treatment of a given a quantum hamiltonian , has unusual degrees of freedom and interactions , unanticipated in the study of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the naive mapping with just @xmath16 can then miss important and intriguing phenomena special to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "thus , in our view the approach of directly studying quantum mechanical designer hamiltonians is an important direction in forming an unbiased picture of quantum criticality and emergent phenomena .      in this review",
    ", we will focus on some recent examples where it has been possible to study quantum phase transitions in detail by qmc simulations and to make quantitative comparisons of extracted universal quantities with field theoretic results .",
    "we also discuss other fascinating quantum phenomena , e.g. , emergent gauge fields and entanglement , where qmc studies are playing a critical role in establishing benchmarks and gaining insights that are hard or impossible to extract from the field theories .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] with some further discussion and an outlook on future prospects and challenges .",
    "there is a wide range of qmc methods available for studies of different classes of lattice models @xcite . in this review",
    "we focus on spin models , and therefore restrict the discussion to the types of methods most suitable for them .",
    "these methods are also often well suited for studies of bosons , where a substantial body of work has been carried out in the past several years , stimulated by ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . for fermions , there are alternative approaches , based upon auxiliary fields decoupling the interactions and subsequent analytical tracing - out of the fermions @xcite .",
    "these methods have a much less severe fermion sign problem ( in some cases completely avoiding it , e.g. , for particle - hole symmetric systems)with the exception of 1d systems , where the methods discussed here also work well ( since the signs from anticommutation normally do not appear in this geometry ) . we will only give a brief non - techical overview of qmc methods here , with references to more detailed accounts .",
    "solving many - body quantum mechanical problems on a computer is _ generally _ exponentially hard ( in computing time versus system size ) with known algorithms .",
    "the statistical mechanics of a @xmath8-dimensional quantum hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of some classical variables @xmath18 in @xmath15 dimensions , i.e. , the partition function ( @xmath19 ) or the normalization ( @xmath20 ) can be cast into the form @xmath21 systems of interest can , for practical , known ways of transforming into this form , have both positive and negative weights @xmath22 , invalidating the usual interpretation of @xmath23 as a probability distribution in monte carlo simulations .",
    "formally , this difficulty can be side - stepped by not including the sign in the probability , using @xmath24 , and compensating for this by weighting observables with the sign ; @xmath25 the problem here is that the numerator and denominator in the last expression both approach zero exponentially in system size and inverse temperature , and , hence , resolving the ratio within statistical noise is exponentially hard . the advantage of importance sampling ( time speed - up from exponential to polynomial scaling ) is then lost .",
    "this predicament is the qmc sign problem @xcite .    here , we consider classes of quantum hamiltonians for which it is possible to choose a basis in which all the @xmath26 .",
    "these sign - problem free models can generally be simulated in polynomial time by importance sampling , allowing access to large system sizes ( with the exception of `` glassy '' systems and other systems where even classical monte carlo simulations scale exponentially ) . in some cases ,",
    "sign problems that appear intractable at first - sight can be solved in more sophisticated ways , e.g. , in the meron algorithm @xcite . here",
    "we implicitly consider cases where the `` de - signing '' is essentially automatic , being a direct consequence of the non - positivity of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian .      in _ finite - temperature _ methods , the goal is to compute thermal averages @xmath27 where @xmath28 . as an alternative to studying the ground state in the limit of @xmath29 , in a _ ground - state projector _",

    ", one can use the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath38 or a high power of the hamiltonian ; @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 gives the same rate of convergence for the two choices of projectors for a given system size @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from a taylor expansion of the time evolution operator , which for large @xmath41 is dominated by powers of the order @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ground state energy .",

    "in practice , @xmath20 and @xmath19 schemes for a given model are often very similar . in both cases ,",
    "the exponential operator can be treated with path - integral methods ",
    "world lines in discrete @xcite or continuous @xcite imaginary time  starting from a product of `` time slice '' evolution operators , @xmath46 complete sets of states are then inserted between the exponentials ( and the trace is further taken at @xmath19 ) .",

    "( [ za1 ] ) and ( [ za2 ] ) is essentially only in the boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction ; periodic for @xmath19 ( due to the trace being taken ) and dictated by the nature of the trial state in @xmath20 projections .",

    "there is no sign problem in these approaches for spin systems with non - positive definite off - diagonal matrix elements ( for a properly chosen trial state in the case of the @xmath20 approach ) . for bipartite antiferromagnetic interactions a sublattice rotation can accomplish this , or , equivalently",

    "beyond disordered spin models , various manifestations of the `` dirty boson '' problem remain intriguing and challenging @xcite , and provide excellent examples of the indispensable role of qmc studies of designer hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "an example is the extended hardcore bose - hubbard model with random frustrated interactions on a 3d cubic lattice .",
    "qmc simulations have been instrumental in discovering that glassiness can coexist with superfluidity , and that quantum fluctuations and random frustration are both crucial ingredients needed to stabilize a `` superglass '' state @xcite .",
    "in addition to extensive disorder , single - impurity problems are also interesting and important",
    ". effects of a single missing or added spin have been investigated with qmc in the 2d and 3d nel states @xcite and at conventional quantum - critical points in dimerized models @xcite .",
    "qmc studies have also been done on vacancies in the vbs state of the 2d @xmath128-@xmath129 model @xcite , where one can observe a vortex in the order parameter , and at the su(@xmath0 ) and su(@xmath111 ) critical points @xcite , where impurities provide an interesting way to probe the anomalously large corrections to scaling in these systems .",
    "impurities in 1d chains ( with open edges ) have also been studied @xcite .    in general , impurities and disorder in interacting quantum systems present rich opportunities for further exploring exotic states and phase transitions .",
    "synergistic combinations of low - energy field theories , rg schemes for impurities @xcite and disorder @xcite , and qmc studies of designer hamiltonians will be needed to make progress here .",
    "a recent development on the methods front is the adaptation of qmc algorithms such as those discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] to non - equilibrium setups @xcite . by studying time evolution out of a non - equilibrium state in imaginary time",
    ", standard sign - problem free systems can be analyzed in novel ways .",
    "for instance , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the dynamic scaling properties when quenching to a quantum - critical point is the same in real and imaginary time , and that such protocols are useful for extracting the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "moreover , the fidelity and full geometric tensor , which characterize the geometrical properties of the state space , can be accessed this way .",
    "one can anticipate many fruitful applications of this unconventional qmc approach , which gives access to dynamics beyond the commonly used numerical analytic continuation of qmc - computed equilibrium imaginary - timecorrelation functions @xcite .",
