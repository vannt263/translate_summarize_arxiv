    "the subtleties of appropriately defining the speed of light pulses in dispersive media have been investigated for over a century .",
    "although a careful classical analysis was performed early in the twentieth century ( see , for example , the papers collected in reference @xcite ) , recent observations of anomalously slow @xcite and anomalously fast @xcite speeds of light have returned studies of light propagation to the pages of contemporary physics journals , and a recent review so - called superluminal propagation is contained in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the scattering of single spontaneously emitted photons and develop a simple fully - quantized microscopic model of light propagation in a dielectric medium .",
    "we also compare this quantized model to a simple microscopic classical model of scattering from charged oscillators .",
    "although our models are limited to the simplest case of weak scattering in linear dielectrics , they serve as a basis for understanding propagation in more complex media at the quantum level .",
    "classical pulses can be understood as the superposition of the incident field with fields re - radiated by the atoms of the medium .",
    "this point of view has been articulated clearly by feynman @xcite , with recent elaborations by sherwood @xcite and milonni @xcite .",
    "the re - radiated fields are phase - shifted and attenuated relative to the incident field , and the leading edges of all fields propagate at the vacuum speed of light @xmath0 .",
    "we identify quantum mechanical quantities that have a striking quantitative parallel in the complex analytic signal describing fields in the classical model .",
    "although the state vector describing the system has no absolute overall phase , the scattering - induced phase shift of the classical field is manifested in the description of the quantum field as well as in the probability amplitude for atoms subsequently excited by the field .",
    "the pulse re - shaping of classical fields that leads to group delays is also evident in our quantum model , and results in delays that are equivalent in the classical and quantum models .",
    "all delays are clearly due to the superposition of quantum effects that propagate at the vacuum speed of light @xmath0 , in spite of the appearance of delays that seemingly imply so - called superluminal velocities .",
    "the parallels between classical and quantum scattered fields facilitate the understanding of delays of single photons in terms of classical concepts .",
    "the classical medium we consider consists of charged point particles attached to their equilibrium positions by linear restoring forces .",
    "this model is considered in undergraduate textbooks @xcite .",
    "the classical medium has an index of refraction which for a dilute collection of scatterers depends linearly on the density of the scatterers , and the index of refraction determines the phase and group velocities of radiation in the medium .",
    "our quantum system consists of a set of two - level atoms at fixed positions interacting with the quantized modes of a one - dimensional multimode optical cavity .",
    "an initially excited atom spontaneously emits radiation into the modes of the cavity ( a photon ) ; the radiation is scattered by a second atom ; and a third atom serves as a detector .",
    "we find an analytical expression describing the excitation of the detector atom , and an expression for the expectation value of the space- and time - dependent electromagnetic field intensity .",
    "we then identify an exact quantum analog to the complex analytic signal of a classical field .",
    "the scattering - induced time delays in the quantum mechanical quantities thus have direct parallels in classical delays .",
    "we also find a simple , unambiguous , and causal interpretation at the quantum level of a superluminal velocity that occurs in the region of anomalous dispersion very near to an atomic resonance .",
    "we note that the results obtained analytically in this paper may also be observed using straightforward numerical techniques like those used in references @xcite .",
    "our work bears a particularly close relationship to the numerical work reported in @xcite , in which quantum interference effects are observed in the scattering of single - photon wavepackets .",

    "the delay in the arrival of a point of constant phase on the far side of the medium ( compared to a wave traveling in vacuum ) is determined by the phase velocity @xmath3 .",
    "this delay is given by @xmath4 the delay in the arrival of the peak of a modulation envelope of a quasi - monochromatic pulse is determined by the group velocity @xmath5 , and is given by @xmath6    for pulses that are not sufficiently monochromatic , the simple concepts of phase and group velocity are inadequate to characterize all of the effects of pulse - reshaping as the field propagates .",
    "several other velocities and delays have been developed ( see , for example , references @xcite ) and in this paper we focus on a delay determined by the `` temporal center of gravity '' of the field intensity of a pulse at a fixed position @xmath7 `` downstream '' from the dielectric , i.e. , @xmath8 this is closely related to concepts used to define the centrovelocity in @xcite .",
    "for quasi - monochromatic pulses far from resonance this delay is equivalent to the group delay , but in general it is necessary to calculate explicitly the field @xmath9 in order to determine @xmath10 . for the spontaneously emitted pulses with lorentzian spectrums that are considered in this paper we will show that the `` temporal - center - of - gravity '' delay happens to be equal to twice the group delay .    in order to find classical expressions for the index of refraction and absorption we follow the development outlined by feynman @xcite .",
