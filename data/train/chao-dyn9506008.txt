    "present research on quantum chaos focuses mainly on what berry @xcite has called quantum chaology , namely `` the study of semiclassical , but nonclassical , behavior characteristic of systems whose classical motion exhibits chaos . ''",
    "we pursue a different approach , which seeks to identify intrinsically chaotic features within quantum dynamics .",
    "a straightforward application of this approach , which attempts to generalize the classical notion of sensitivity to initial conditions , fails immediately , for two reasons : first , there is no quantum analogue of the classical phase - space trajectories in terms of which sensitivity to initial conditions is defined and , second , the unitarity of linear schrdinger evolution precludes sensitivity to initial conditions in the quantum dynamics of state vectors .",
    "a classical hamiltonian system has , however , in addition to its description in terms of trajectories governed by the hamilton equations of motion , an equivalent description in terms of liouville probability densities governed by the liouville equation . because it conserves phase - space volumes , the linear liouville equation shares with the schrdinger equation a lack of sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "again , in berry s words @xcite , `` the fact that this equation is linear and yet preserves the chaos of the trajectories disposes of the argument that the linearity of the schrdinger equation is responsible for the absence of chaos in quantum mechanics . ''",
    "we have recently established a criterion for classical chaos in terms of liouville probability densities @xcite , which we call _ hypersensitivity to perturbation _ and which has a straightforward quantum analogue @xcite .",
    "hypersensitivity to perturbation for a quantum system is defined in purely quantum terms , not in the semiclassical domain .",
    "though quantum systems show no sensitivity to initial conditions , due to unitarity , they do show what one might call sensitivity to parameters in the hamiltonian , as has been demonstrated for the quantum kicked top by peres @xcite .",
    "our approach to quantum chaos could be viewed as a generalization of peres s work : whereas peres compares the time evolution of the same initial hilbert - space vector for two slightly different parameter values in the kicked - top hamiltonian , we study the distribution of hilbert - space vectors arising from the many possible ways in which the hamiltonian time evolution can be perturbed through interaction with an environment . our approach , however , is embedded in a broader information - theoretic framework @xcite that is quite different from the viewpoint expressed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present numerical evidence that hypersensitivity to perturbation is present in a variety of quantum maps .",
    "we make no attempt to develop a general theory of quantum hypersensitivity to perturbation ; rather , our attitude in this paper is exploratory : by investigating numerically the perturbed dynamics of several quantum systems , we seek to determine whether hypersensitivity to perturbation provides a criterion for distinguishing regular from chaotic dynamics in quantum systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sechyp ] defines hypersensitivity to perturbation and reviews the main results for classical hamiltonian systems .",
    "section  [ sectop ] introduces the model of the quantum kicked top interacting with a perturbing environment .",
    "section  [ secgen ] explains how hypersensitivity to perturbation can be related to the distribution of vectors in hilbert space ; sec .",
    "[ secres ] contains numerical results for the quantum kicked top . in sec .",

    "section  [ conc ] concludes with brief discussion .",
    "hypersensitivity to perturbation , in either classical or quantum mechanics , is defined in terms of information and entropy .",
    "the entropy @xmath0 of an isolated physical system ( gibbs entropy for a classical system , von neumann entropy for a quantum system ) does not change under hamiltonian time evolution .",
    "if the time evolution of the system is perturbed through interaction with an incompletely known environment @xmath1 , however , averaging over the perturbation typically leads to an entropy increase @xmath2 .",
    "the increase of the system entropy can be limited to an amount @xmath3 , the _ tolerable entropy increase _ , by obtaining , from the environment , information about the perturbation .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the minimum information about the environment needed , on the average , to keep the system entropy below the tolerable level @xmath3 .",
    "a formal definition of the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is given below .",
    "entropy and information acquire physical content in the presence of a heat reservoir at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "if all energy in the form of heat is ultimately exchanged with the heat reservoir , then each bit of entropy , i.e. , each bit of _ missing information _ about the system state , reduces by the amount @xmath6 the energy that can be extracted from the system in the form of useful work .",
    "the connection between _ acquired _ information and work is provided by landauer s principle @xcite , according to which not only each bit of missing information , but also each bit of acquired information , has a free - energy cost of @xmath6 .",
    "this cost , the _ landauer erasure cost _ , is payed when the acquired information is erased .",
    "acquired information can be quantified by algorithmic information @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to define hypersensitivity to perturbation .",
    "we say that a system is hypersensitive to perturbation if the information @xmath7 required to reduce the system entropy from @xmath8 to @xmath9 is large compared to the entropy reduction @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 the information @xmath4 purchases a reduction @xmath12 in system entropy , which is equivalent to an increase in the useful work that can be extracted from the system ; hypersensitivity to perturbation means that the landauer erasure cost of the information is much larger than the increase in available work .",
    "hypersensitivity to perturbation means that the inequality  ( [ eqhyp ] ) holds for almost all values of @xmath3 .",
    "the inequality  ( [ eqhyp ] ) tends always to hold , however , for sufficiently small values of @xmath13 .",
    "the reason is that for these small values of @xmath3 , one is gathering enough information from the perturbing environment to track a particular system state whose entropy is nearly equal to the initial system entropy . in other words , one is essentially tracking a particular realization of the perturbation among all possible realizations .",
    "thus , for small values of @xmath3 , the information @xmath4 becomes a property of the perturbation ; it is the information needed to specify a particular realization of the perturbation .",
    "the important regime for assessing hypersensitivity to perturbation is where @xmath3 is fairly close to @xmath8 , and it is in this regime that one can hope that @xmath4 reveals something about the system dynamics , rather than properties of the perturbation .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that a large class of classically chaotic systems shows _ exponential hypersensitivity to perturbation _ , which is characterized by an exponential growth with time of the ratio ( [ eqhyp ] ) between information and entropy reduction , for a broad range of values of @xmath3 below @xmath8",
    ". the exponential rate of growth is determined by the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the classical dynamics . in preliminary work",
    "@xcite we have applied the notion of hypersensitivity to perturbation to quantum systems and , through numerical simulations , have shown that hypersensitivity to perturbation seems to distinguish regular from chaotic quantum dynamics .",
    "the present paper contains a more detailed treatment of hypersensitivity to perturbation , including numerical evidence for a range of prototypic quantum systems .    to define the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 rigorously in the quantum case , consider a quantum system @xmath14 coupled to an environment @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the total system @xmath15 is initially in a product state @xmath16 combining a pure system state @xmath17 with a mixed environment state @xmath18 .",
    "the initial von neumann entropy @xmath0 of the system is zero . after evolving for a time @xmath19 under the action of the total hamiltonian @xmath20 ,",
    "the total system is described by a density operator @xmath21 , which is generally not a product state .",
    "the state @xmath22 of the system @xmath23 alone at time @xmath19 is then obtained by tracing over the environment , @xmath24 the increase in system entropy due to tracing over the environment is given by @xmath25    now suppose a measurement is performed on the environment @xmath1 .",
    "the most general measurement is described by a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xcite .",
    "we assume for convenience that the measurement is described by a povm that has a discrete set of possible outcomes @xmath26 with probabilities @xmath27 . for each measurement outcome @xmath26 , we denote by @xmath28 the system state conditional on the measurement outcome @xmath26 ; the conditional system states obey the relation ( for a justification , see appendix a ) @xmath29 we further define the system entropy conditional on measurement outcome @xmath26 , @xmath30 the average conditional entropy @xmath31 and the average information @xmath32 actually @xmath33 is a lower bound to the average algorithmic information needed to specify the measurement outcome @xmath26 .",
    "one of us has shown @xcite , however , that the minimum average algorithmic information can be bounded above by @xmath34 , so that @xmath33 is an excellent approximation to the minimum average algorithmic information .    the minimum amount of information about the perturbing environment to keep the system entropy from increasing by more than the tolerable amount @xmath3 can now be defined as @xmath35 where the infimum is taken over all environment measurements for which the average conditional entropy increase @xmath36 does not exceed @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", @xmath4 is the information about the environment it takes to reduce the entropy increase of the system from @xmath2 ( the increase due to averaging over the perturbation ) down to @xmath3 ; i.e. , @xmath4 is the minimum information about the environment needed to purchase a reduction @xmath37 in system entropy .",
