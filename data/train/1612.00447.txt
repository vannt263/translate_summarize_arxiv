    "three main methods of estimating the merger fraction are : counting close pairs of galaxies , assuming that they will subsequently merge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "higher gas fractions might lead the formation of massive ( @xmath20m@xmath4 ) clumps by gravitational fragmentation of dynamically unstable gas @xcite .",
    "the typical rotation velocities of these systems are @xmath21 kms@xmath14 , so very similar to local galaxies @xcite , but the typical velocity dispersion values range from 50 to 100 kms@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this means a circular velocity to velocity dispersion ratio ( v@xmath22 ) range from 1 to 10 at @xmath23 @xcite . by comparison , the milky way and other similar thin disks galaxies at low-@xmath17 have v@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the gas dynamics of high-@xmath17 galaxies are not just dominated by ordered rotation or random motions , but by a contribution from both .",
    "if the structural properties of galaxy disks have varied over cosmic time , we would expect to see evidence in kinematic scaling relations .",
    "for example , one potential evidence would be an evolution of the tully - fisher relationship @xcite , which describes the interdependence of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies by studying the evolution of the stellar luminosity ( m@xmath25 ) versus circular velocity .",
    "it traces a simple means of the build - up of galaxy disks at different epochs .",
    "since the @xmath26-band luminosity is sensitive to recent star formation , attempts have also been made to measure the evolution of the stellar mass ( m@xmath27 ) tully - fisher relation which reflects the relation between the past - average star - formation history and halo mass .",
    "in particular , hydrodynamic models suggest that the zero - point of the stellar mass tully - fisher relationship should evolve by @xmath281.1 dex at fixed circular velocity between @xmath29 @xcite . at a given rotational velocity ,",
    "the stellar mass in a high-@xmath17 disk galaxy should be smaller than a low-@xmath17 disk galaxy as star - formation builds it up .",
    "substantial efforts have been made in order to measure the tully - fisher relationship at redshift @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have measured a stellar - mass tfr zero - point evolution of @xmath120.41@xmath130.08 dex for rotationally supported galaxies defined with v/@xmath30@xmath313 from the ` kmos redshift one spectroscopic survey ' ( kross ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , they measure no significant offset in the absolute rest - frame @xmath32-band tfr ( m@xmath33-tfr ) over the same period . this excess of @xmath32-band luminosity at fixed stellar mass measured from the high-@xmath17 galaxies could be explained by considering their higher sfrs in comparison with their local universe counterparts at same stellar mass .",
    "the excess of light that comes from young stars decreases the mass - to - light ratio in high-@xmath17 galaxies decoupling the evolution of both , the m@xmath33-tfr and the m@xmath34-tfr .",
    "if the tully - fisher relationship evolves with redshift , then it would be expected that the galaxy size - velocity relation also evolves @xcite . in a @xmath35cdm cosmology",
    ", the sizes of galaxy disks and their rotational velocities should be proportional to their parent dark matter halos , and since the halos are denser at high-@xmath17 for a fixed circular velocity , then disk sizes should scale inversely with hubble time @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the size - velocity relation has been observed @xcite , but increasing the number statistics should be helpful in order to overcome random errors due to different methods and conversions of size measurements .",
    "a third potential observational tool to constrain galaxy evolution models is the measure of the chemical abundance within galaxies using a simple disk model .",
    "if the gas accretion in high - redshift galaxies is via accretion of pristine gas from the igm along filaments onto the galaxy disk at 1020kpc from the galaxy centre , then the inner disks of galaxies should be enriched by star - formation and supernovae whilst the outer - disk is continually diluted by pristine material , leaving strong negative abundance gradients @xcite .",
    "this gradient would flatten if the igm gas is redistributed , e.g.  via merger interactions .",
    "to chart the evolution of star - forming galaxies with cosmic time , we exploit the panoramic ( degree - scale ) high-@xmath1 emission line survey ( hizels ) .",

    "this survey provides a large luminosity - limited sample of homogeneously selected h@xmath0 emitters at the cosmic star - formation density peak epoch , and provides a powerful resource for studying the properties of starburst galaxies and the star - forming galaxies that shows a tight dependence of sfr on stellar mass , the so - called ` main - sequence ' of star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "most of the hizels galaxies will likely evolve into @xmath2l@xmath38 galaxies by @xmath16 @xcite , but are seen at a time when they are assembling most of their stellar mass , and thus are seen at a critical stage in their evolutionary history .    in this paper , we present adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy with sinfoni , yielding @xmath39 resolution ( @xmath2kpc scale ) , of eleven star - forming galaxies selected from the hizels survey in three redshift slices , @xmath400.8 , 1.47 and 2.23 @xcite . the hizels survey is based on observations obtained using the wide field camera ( wfcam ) on the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ; @xcite ) .",

    "this is in concordance with previous observations of galaxies at @xmath512 @xcite . assuming that the dynamics of the underlying mass distribution are coupled to the measured kinematics of the ionized gas , then these observed high-@xmath17 galaxies are consistent with highly turbulent systems .",
    "although a ratio of v@xmath50/@xmath30 = 0.4 has been used to crudely differentiate rotating systems from mergers @xcite , more detailed kinematic modelling is essential to reliably distinguish these two populations .",
    "we therefore attempt to model the two - dimensional velocity field by first identifying the dynamical centre and the kinematic major axis .",
    "we follow @xcite to construct two - dimensional models with an input rotation curve following an arctan function ( v(r)=@xmath52v@xmath53arctan(r / r@xmath54 ) ) , where v@xmath53 is the asymptotic rotational velocity and r@xmath54 is the effective radius at which the rotation curve turns over @xcite .",

    "this technique has been well calibrated and tested at low redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whilst at high redshift it has been used to determine the strength of deviations of the observed velocity and dispersion maps from an ideal rotating disk @xcite . briefly , kinemetry proceeds to analyse the two dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion maps using azimuthal kinematic profiles in an outward series of best fitting elliptical rings . the kinematic profile as a function of angle",
