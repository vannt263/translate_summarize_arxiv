    "the  region luminosity function ( lf ) is an important diagnostic of star formation properties in galaxies .",
    "it is a fairly straightforward parameter to determine for nearby galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt , edgar , & hodge 1989 ; banfi etal .",
    "1993 ; rozas , beckman , & knapen 1996a ; thilker etal .",
    "2002 ) , and is usually presented in the differential form as a power law : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of nebulae with h@xmath6  luminosities in the range @xmath7 to @xmath8 . occasionally , the cumulative lf  is given , but we note that the differential form is a more powerful diagnostic of the underlying properties ( cioffi & shull 1991 ) .    in an earlier paper ( oey & clarke 1998 , hereafter paper  i ) , we modeled the behavior of the lf , and identified ways in which it can be used to examine the current properties of massive star formation and recent ( @xmath9 myr ) star formation history .",
    "we assumed a power - law distribution in @xmath10 , the number of ionizing stars per object : @xmath11 we then performed monte carlo simulations , in which we draw @xmath10 from this distribution , and also draw the individual stellar masses from a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "these models showed that reported variations of the measured slope @xmath12 ( equation  [ eqhlf ] ) in different environments _ do not require varying @xmath13 _ , the slope of the @xmath10 distribution ( equation  [ n * ] ) , but rather , can be explained by variations in the star formation history and the upper cutoff in the @xmath10 distribution .",
    "an important feature is that stochastic effects for objects with small @xmath10 cause a flattening in the lfbelow a certain luminosity @xmath14 .",
    "sparse clusters subject to this effect are termed `` unsaturated '' with respect to the imf , and clusters with higher @xmath10 we call `` saturated '' .",
    "we identified @xmath14 with the h@xmath6  luminosity associated with the most massive star in the imf , although we refer readers to paper  i for a complete discussion .",
    "a basic test on the nature of the lf  is its relation to the size distribution of the  regions .",
    "although the lfhas empirically been described by a power law , the corresponding size distribution has been described by an exponential law ( van den bergh 1981 ; hodge 1983 , 1987 ) . as discussed above , paper  i found that the slope breaks and other features in the lf  are nevertheless best explained by a simple power law in @xmath10 ( equation  [ n * ] of paper  i ) .",
    "therefore we should naively expect the size distribution to also follow a power - law distribution . in  2 below",
    ", we examine whether observations of the  region size distribution are consistent with a simple power - law relationship .",
    "another test on the nature of the lf  addresses its evolutionary properties .",
    "the models constructed in paper  i included the evolution of the lf  resulting from a single burst creation scenario . in figure  [ figmod ] , we show representative zero - age and 7 myr models ( figures  2@xmath12 and @xmath15 of paper  i ) . the zero - age model shows the flattening below @xmath14 . as time goes by , the entire lf  shifts to lower @xmath7 .",
    "however , when considering a fixed range of @xmath7 , this can result in an apparent elimination of the slope break in strongly evolved populations , due to the differential fading effect .",
    "if this model turns out to be correct , it would then be possible to distinguish , for example , between an older nebular population where high - luminosity objects were created in a single burst , and continuous creation of low - luminosity  regions .",
    "paper  i applied these results to observations of arm and interarm regions of grand design spiral galaxies , suggesting that arm populations represent the current burst of star formation , while interarm objects represent an aged population remaining in the wake of the spiral density waves .",
    "observations in the literature sometimes suggest that interarm populations show a slightly steeper lf  than the arm populations ( e.g. , kennicutt etal .  1989 ; rand 1992 ) . this phenomenon can be explained by the two - slope structure in the zero - age models , which will cause a slope measurement to be flatter when fitted over @xmath7 below @xmath14 ( see figure  [ figmod ] ) . in contrast , the evolved populations show the intrinsic slope of the high-@xmath7 regime .",
    "figure  5 of paper  i shows that this interpretation of evolution between the arm and interarm  regions is consistent , in all cases , with available observations of six grand design spiral galaxies .",
    "observations of the lf  in the literature to date have been subjectively and coarsely binned into the arm and interarm categories .",
    "a more powerful test of this evolutionary scenario would be to rebin the  regions more quantitatively into regions corresponding to fixed age ranges behind the leading edge of the spiral arms , as inferred from the spiral arm pattern speeds",
    ". we might then be able to examine the competing contributions in interarm regions , of aging nebular populations versus bona fide interarm star formation .",
    "these are our motivations for carrying out the studies described in  3 . as an important by - product of this study",
    ", we developed a technique that compares nebular positions with spatial isochrones for the spiral density waves .",
    "this offers a new method for locating the corotation resonances in spiral galaxies , and is described in  4 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the conventional parameterization of the  region size distribution as an exponential ( e.g. , van den bergh 1981 ; hodge 1983 , 1987 ) is intuitively at odds with the power - law form of the lf .",
    "since the lf s behavior appears to be fairly well - understood ( e.g. , paper  i ) , it is important to reexamine the size distribution within the same framework , since they are physically related . in particular , we might also expect the size distribution to follow a power law of the form , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the nebular radius .",
    "this has indeed been suggested for some galaxies ( e.g. , pleuss , heller , & fricke 2000 ) .",
    "since the nebular h@xmath6  luminosity @xmath7 is integrated from the nebular volume emission , we should expect @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the differential size distribution should be : @xmath20 hence we find that the slopes @xmath12 and @xmath21 of the lf  and size distribution , respectively , are related as @xmath22 . for the usual value @xmath23 found for the high - luminosity , `` saturated ''  regions , we therefore predict a corresponding size distribution having @xmath24 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a turnover in the lf  caused by stochastic effects for `` unsaturated '' objects occurs at a luminosity @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath14 is associated with the most massive stars in the imf , their strmgren radius @xmath25 should be a corresponding inflection point in the size distribution .",
    "this flattening at small @xmath17 can mimic an exponential distribution .",
    "for the most massive stars , stellar atmosphere models suggest @xmath26 to 38.5 ( schaerer & de koter 1997 ; vacca , garmany , & shull 1996 ; panagia 1973 ) , implying @xmath27 pc for a density of @xmath28 .",
    "this estimate for @xmath25 should be taken as an upper limit , since the density is likely to be higher in the actual , central star forming area .",
    "we can now compare observations of the  region size distribution to our predictions for slope @xmath24 , with a flattening in @xmath17 below @xmath29 .",
    "we refitted the nebular diameter distributions with power laws for a number of galaxies in the literature . since size determinations can be sensitive to different methods , and thus to ensure relatively consistent comparisons , we used data from only two groups of investigators : the iac  hertfordshire collaboration ( knapen et al .",
    "1993 ; rozas et al .",
    "1996b ; knapen 1998 ) , and youngblood & hunter ( 1999 ) .",

    "1999 ) and petit s group ( e.g. , petit 1993 , 1996 , 1998 ) have contributed many studies of  region size distributions ; however , their target galaxies generally do not offer enough objects to adequately sample the nebular size distribution at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the nebular diameter .",
    "likewise , we include only the three galaxies from the youngblood & hunter ( 1999 ) sample that provide adequate sampling in this regime .",
    "figure  [ sizedist ] shows the size distributions for the nine galaxies listed in table  [ sizeref ] .",
    "we fitted power law slopes for @xmath32 , with the bins weighted by @xmath33 .",
    "the iac  hertfordshire galaxies are grand design spirals and the youngblood & hunter galaxies are magellanic irregulars .",
    "both these sets of galaxies have lfs extending to high luminosities , consistent with no upper cutoff in luminosity .",
    "our fits to the size distributions therefore should not be influenced by possible truncation at the upper end of the lf .",
    "it appears that the region diameter distributions shown in figure  [ sizedist ] are consistent with power laws in the given regime .",
    "objects with smaller diameters show a flattening in the size distribution , qualitatively consistent with the flattening in the lf  for statistically unsaturated objects .",

    "while consistent functional forms are expected for the size distribution and lf , further confirmation of the empirical power law for the former is desireable , with attention to systematic uncertainties in size determinations .",
    "based on paper  i , we approximate that the  regions found along the leading edge of spiral arms represent the youngest , zero - age population of objects",
    ".  regions behind the leading edge therefore represent a somewhat older population remaining in the wake of the spiral density wave .",
    "if the galactic rotation curve and spiral arm pattern speed are known , it is in principle possible to estimate the ages of objects based on their location with respect to the leading edges of the spiral arms .",
    "this would also assume that the velocities of the  regions do not deviate significantly from the galactic rotation curve during the passage of the density wave .",
    "we have developed a code that computes spatial isochrones from the rotation curve , given the current locus of the spiral arms .",

    "the adopted corotation radius is shown with the black dashed line , and the inner and outer lindblad resonances are shown in the solid and dotted black lines , respectively , assuming @xmath37 spiral arms for these galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , it appears that the isochrone spatial separation that is sensitive to the nebular evolutionary timescale is of order the spatial scatter of the objects along the spiral density wave .",
    "figures  [ isochrones]@xmath38 show that the best - defined arms are enclosed within the 12 to + 12 myr isochrones , but show a spatial scatter that precludes further distinction .",
    "ngc 6951 is an exception ( figure  [ isochrones]@xmath39 ) , showing larger separation between the isochrones that also corresponds to the nebular spatial distribution .",
    "figures  [ m51hlf ]  6 show the lf  for sub - groups of  regions binned within isochrones for 12 to + 12 myr ( panels @xmath12 ) ; 0 to 24 myr ( panels @xmath21 ) , and 12 to 36 myr ( panels @xmath15 ) . as discussed above from paper  i , the lf  naturally shows a break in slope below the high - luminosity power - law tail , that is caused primarily by the transition to unsaturated stellar clusters dominated by small - number statistics . for older nebular populations , this slope transition at @xmath14",
    "is expected to shift toward lower luminosities , while the high - luminosity power - law slope remains the same ( figure  [ figmod ] above ; paper  i ) .",
    "the vertical dotted line in these figures shows the luminosity bin where we estimate @xmath14 to occur for the youngest binning ; this value is plotted for reference , and remains constant between the three lf  subsets for each galaxy .",
    "it is apparent in figures  [ m51hlf ]  6 that the location of @xmath14 is essentially indistinguishable between the three subsets .",
    "the transition point generally appears to be more ambiguous in the oldest binnings ( panels @xmath15 ) as compared to the youngest ( panels @xmath12 ) , but more galaxies must be examined to determine whether that pattern is real .",
    "if so , then it would be consistent with a greater contribution from evolved populations ( paper  i ) .",
    "the ambiguities again reflect our discussion above , that the isochrones for these galaxies are insensitive to aging effects , since the spatial scatter is of order the separation for isochrones over the nebular evolution time scale .",
    "a number of other factors probably also contribute to the insensitivity of the isochrones to aging effects .",
    "first , the models in paper  i ( e.g. , figure  [ figmod ] above ) assumed the instantaneous creation of all objects in the lf , whereas triggering by the spiral density wave most likely has a finite timescale . since most  regions recombine on timescales of @xmath9 myr , we would not expect any significant population to be visible at 24 myr .",
    "for the most part , this is consistent with the fairly negligible h@xmath6  emission at the 24 myr isochrone for most of the arms in m51 , m100 , and ngc 157 .",
    "ngc 6951 shows spatially more extensive star formation , with  regions also seen along the 24 myr isochrone ; this therefore implies an extended timescale for star formation at any given location .",
    "an extended star - formation timescale is also equivalent to a spatial scatter for objects of any given age , as mentioned above .",
    "for the lfs , this will blur the distinction between the youngest subset and next - to - youngest .",
    "it may also be that the luminosity fading of the  regions is even faster than our extreme model in paper  i ( see paper  i , figure  2@xmath40 ) .",
    "another factor that affects the quantitative comparison to the lf  evolution is the uncertainty in identifying and fitting the locus of the zero - age density wave .",
    "finally , our simple analytic description for the rotation curve and pattern speed are idealized forms that do not describe the details of the gas kinematics ( see  4 below ) , which also affect the location of the spatial isochrones .",
    "thus , our test of the evolutionary features in the lf  for these galaxies is inconclusive , though an upper limit on the evolutionary effects is indicated . for most of the galaxies , the spatial isochrones do not offer the necessary separation to isolate populations of  regions triggered in the arm density waves .",
    "we now describe our analysis of spatial isochrones , which offer some interesting insights on spiral arm kinematics .    while measurements of rotation curves are fairly straightforward , historically it has been much more difficult to estimate the spiral density wave pattern speed , or equivalently , to determine the location of the corotation radius .",
    "several methods for determining the corotation radius or pattern speed have been proposed in the past .",
    "the earliest proposal was based on lin s ( 1970 ) conjecture that organized , two - armed spiral patterns exist only within the corotation circle , and that arms become more fragmented outside .",
    "shu , stachnik , & yost ( 1971 ) were among the first to apply this conjecture to physical galaxies , placing the corotation where the distribution of  regions is seen to end .",
    "tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) developed an approach for pattern speed determination based on measurement of surface brightness and velocity distributions of luminosity density tracers , assuming continuity in the tracer .",
    "canzian s ( 1993 ) method for determining corotation relies on the qualitative difference in the residual velocity field inside versus outside of corotation .",
    "elmegreen , elmegreen , & seiden ( 1989 ) identified resonances through breaks in spiral arms , and cepa & beckman ( 1990 ) utilized the radial star formation efficiency .",
    "elmegreen , wilcots & pisano ( 1998 ) determined corotation from the transition of the inward to outward streaming gas velocity .",
    "finally , clemens & alexander ( 2001 ) used high - resolution spectroscopic data to find signatures of the pre- and post - shock gas across the spiral arms ; this information determines the shock velocity , and hence , the pattern speed . in what follows ,",
    "we explore a new approach that uses the nebular spatial distribution to constrain the corotation radius .    for a galaxy with a flat rotation curve , the corotation radius @xmath3 is related to the angular pattern speed @xmath41 as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the circular velocity . assuming that star formation is triggered by spiral density waves ,",
    "the locus of the youngest  regions essentially indicates the location of the density wave . as the nebulae age",
    ", their positions will be determined by both the spiral arm pattern speed and the galaxy s rotation curve .",
    "it is therefore possible to determine spatial isochrones for a given galaxy , that represent the positions of objects that all formed simultaneously within a density wave .",
    "our code computes spatial isochrones , given an initial locus for the spiral arm pattern .",
    "the  region positions are deprojected and converted to polar coordinates , and we fit the spiral pattern at the arm s leading edge , using a polynomial function .",
    "we then compute spatial isochrones from the locus of the spiral arm pattern , rotation curve , and putative corotation radius .",
    "we assume a flat rotation curve , except for the innermost regions @xmath44 , where we assume @xmath45 ( table  [ params ] ) .",

    "this greatly limits the ability to obtain clear quantitative constraints on lf  evolutionary parameters as related to the density wave passage . the observed rate of evolution , however , does set limits on the importance of this process in producing the observed arm - interarm variation in the lf .    we are pleased to acknowledge useful discussions with ron allen and blaise canzian , and also comments from the anonymous referee .",

    "<S> we investigate the relationship of the  region luminosity function ( lf ) to the  region size distribution and density wave triggering in grand - design spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the differential nebular size distribution is described by a power law of slope @xmath0 , with flattening at radii below @xmath1 pc . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the conventional exponential description , but it is physically and quantitatively consistent with the typical observed value of @xmath2 for the lf  slope .    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an interactive code that computes spatial isochrones for the evolving loci of spiral density waves in disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this allows comparison of the nebular spatial distribution with the spatial isochrones for simple rotation curve parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our comparisons for four grand - design galaxies suggest that the corotation radius @xmath3 coincides with the outer ends of the star - forming arms . </S>",
    "<S> this value for @xmath3 yields the best spatial correspondence between the  regions and the isochrones , and also appears to yield a coincidence between the inner lindblad resonance with the radial onset of star formation in the arms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , _ we suggest that isochrones offer a new , simple , and effective technique for determining @xmath3 , _ and thus the spiral pattern speed . </S>",
    "<S> however , application of the isochrones also demonstrates that evolution of the nebular population is difficult to spatially isolate in these galaxies . </S>"
