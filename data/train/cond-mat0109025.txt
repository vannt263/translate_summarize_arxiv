    "attention has also been focused on several related models from the point of view of the applicability of the fourier law for heat flux in one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "although the main interest in these specific contexts is in the case of an arbitrary ratio of the masses of the piston and a gas particle , the equal - mass case being a singular one in some sense , the analytical tractability of the latter makes it a valuable  theoretical laboratory \" from which much can be learnt .",
    "in particular , it offers a model in which ( i ) one can pass to the thermodynamic limit in a rigorous manner , and ( ii ) the effect of recollisions can be _ completely and exactly _ taken into account .",
    "the renewed interest in the model prompts us to revisit it and extend its analysis .",
    "we focus on the motion of the central particle ( which we shall refer to as the  piston \" for brevity ) .",
    "a brief recapitulation of the relevant results from earlier work is given in section ii . in section iii",
    "we compute and study the stationary velocity autocorrelation function @xmath0 of the piston in the homogeneous case , when the gases on either side of the piston are in the same macroscopic state ( i.e. , equal densities and arbitrary but identical velocity distributions ) , to amend and extend earlier results .",
    "the explicit expressions obtained for certain archetypical velocity distributions help us analyze the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0 to determine exactly when a power - law decay may be expected , and when the latter is a @xmath1 tail . turning to the inhomogeneous system with different macroscopic states on either side of the piston , in section",
    "iv we determine its effective diffusion coefficient from the asymptotic behavior of the variance of its position , as well as the leading behavior of the other moments about the mean . finally , in section v we show that there is an appealing and direct interpretation of the effective noise to which the many - particle interactions reduce in the thermodynamic limit as far as one - particle dynamics is concerned , and thus of the stochastic process represented by the position of any particle in the system .",

    "it is easily shown that their _ difference _",
    "@xmath208 , which can take on any integer value , has a time - dependent distribution given by @xmath209 it is _ this _ distribution that holds the key to understanding the structure of the one - particle distributions in the problem under consideration .",

    "the latter is @xmath220 when @xmath221 , and @xmath222 when @xmath223 .",

    "similarly , in the same given state the piston can only be hit by a right particle with a velocity in the range @xmath233 , and it follows that @xmath234 since it is the _ magnitude _ of the relative velocity that appears in the mean collision rate .",
    "this explains the genesis and form of the argument of the bessel functions in eq .",

    "the extra factors involving @xmath235 and @xmath236 that appear in the expression for @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) are just the jacobians that arise when we transform from the distribution of @xmath218 to that of @xmath22 . finally ,",
    "although the piston _ can _ have successive left collisions or right collisions in the general case , unlike what happens in the case of the dichotomic velocity distribution , the remarkable fact is that their contribution to the probability distributions seems to vanish in the system at hand .",
    "the number of ` right ' collisions minus the number of ` left ' collisions only takes on the values @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 even in the general case , presumably as a consequence of the smearing out implied by the averaging and the thermodynamic limit . likewise , for the @xmath181th particle from the piston , the difference between the number of times the particle has occupied a right trajectory and the number of times it has occupied a left trajectory up to any time @xmath60 predominantly takes on the values @xmath237 and @xmath238 in this limit .",
    "the central value @xmath237 of this difference is in fact a consequence of its initial ordering , that is not altered by the collisions .",
    "the foregoing provides an understanding of the structure of the terms ( other than the contribution due to the initial state ) in eq .",
    "( [ bthparticle ] ) .    in conclusion , we see that the motion of any particle in the system may be regarded , in the thermodynamic limit , as being driven by two independent poisson pulse processes representing the effects of the gases on the left and right of the central particle .",
