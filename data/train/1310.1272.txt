    "the topological he - mckellar - wilkens ( hmw ) phase introduced in 1993 by x.g .",
    "he and b.h.j .",
    "mckellar @xcite and in 1994 by m.  wilkens @xcite was never tested since its theoretical discovery .",
    "we have recently published such a test @xcite using our lithium atom interferometer . in a companion paper @xcite quoted here as hmwi",
    ", we have recalled the theory of this topological phase and its relations with the aharonov - bohm @xcite and aharonov - casher phases @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed the effects of phase dispersion on interferometer signals and we have considered in detail the phase shifts induced by electric and magnetic fields , namely the dynamical phase shifts due to the stark and zeeman hamiltonian and the topological phase shift due to the aharonov - casher effect . the present paper is devoted to a detailed presentation of the experiment , of its results and of the analysis of the stray effects which have complicated the test of the hmw phase .    in the following sections , we first describe the experiment , the data recording procedure and the interferometer signals ( section [ expset ] ) .",
    "then , we discuss the effects of the electric fields ( section [ elec ] ) and of the magnetic fields ( section [ mag ] ) .",
    "section [ data ] presents the data set for the hmw phase measurement and the raw results .",
    "the model describing the stray effects due to phase shift dispersion , introduced in hmwi and developed in the appendix ( section [ app ] ) , is tested thanks to numerous and sensitive measurements of the fringe phase and visibility ( section [ test ] ) .",
    "thanks to this model , we have been able to reject most of the stray effects and to measure the hmw phase , as detailed in section [ hmwm ] .",
    "a conclusion ( section [ conc ] ) summarizes what we have learnt from this experiment , recalls the open questions ( in particular a phase shift presently not understood ) and discusses how to improve this experiment .",
    "in this part , we briefly describe our atom interferometer and , with greater details , the interaction region used to observe the hmw effect .",
    "we also describe the compensator coil used to produce a magnetic field gradient opposite to the one due to the hmw interaction region .",
    "finally , we explain our data recording procedure which rejects the interferometer phase drifts .      our separated arm atom interferometer ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , has been previously described @xcite . here , we present only its main features and some recent improvements . the atomic source is a supersonic beam of lithium seeded in argon , with a mean velocity @xmath1 m / s .",
    "once collimated by two @xmath2 @xmath3 m wide slits , this beam has a transverse velocity distribution with a width comparable to the recoil velocity of lithium , @xmath4 cm / s .",
    "this beam is then diffracted by three quasi - resonant laser standing waves in the bragg regime : the present experiment uses first order diffraction , with only two diffracted beams of orders @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) .",
    "we thus get a mach - zehnder atom interferometer with two output beams carrying complementary interference signals .",
    "one output beam is selected by a slit and its intensity @xmath8 , measured by a surface ionization detector , is given by :    @xmath9\\ ] ]    @xmath10 is the mean intensity and @xmath11 the fringe visibility .",
    "the phase is the sum of the phase @xmath12 due to perturbations and the phase @xmath13 due to the diffraction process : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the laser wavevector and @xmath16 the @xmath17-position of mirror m@xmath18 .",
    "the choice of the laser frequency , at about @xmath19 ghz on the blue side of the @xmath20s@xmath21 - @xmath20p@xmath22 transition of @xmath23li , and the @xmath24% natural abundance of @xmath23li ensure that the interferometer signal is almost purely due to this isotope @xcite . to record interference fringes",
    ", we sweep the phase @xmath13 by varying @xmath25 with a piezoelectric actuator .",
    "we measure the variations of @xmath25 with a michelson interferometer @xcite .",
    "intense signals , with a mean intensity @xmath26 atoms / s and a high fringe visibility @xmath27% provide a large phase sensitivity , with a practically achieved value @xmath28 mrad@xmath29 .",
    "a hmw phase is induced when an atom propagates in crossed electric and magnetic fields , both transverse to the atom velocity .",
    "our experimental arrangement is inspired by the ideas of h. wei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the electric fields are horizontal , in the interferometer plane , and opposite on the two interferometer arms , while the common magnetic field is vertical and as homogeneous as possible .",
    "the electric fields are produced by a double capacitor with a septum @xcite located between the interferometer arms ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each of the two capacitors is similar to the one we used for the measurement of the electric polarizability of lithium @xcite .",
    "outer electrodes are made of polished @xmath30 mm - thick glass plates with evaporated aluminium electrodes .",
    "a central high - voltage electrode of length @xmath31 mm is separated from two @xmath30 mm - long grounded guard electrodes by @xmath32 mm - wide gaps : these gaps withstand a voltage larger than @xmath32 kv .",
    "the septum is a @xmath33 @xmath3 m thick aluminium foil .",
    "the capacitors are assembled by gluing together the electrodes and the glass spacers ( thickness @xmath34 mm ) with epotex 301 glue ( epoxy technologies ) .",
    "the septum must remain well stretched , even if the capacitor temperature varies . with some advice given by a. cronin , we have acquired the know - how to glue a pre - stretched septum on the electrode - spacer assembly heated near @xmath35c and , due to differential thermal expansion ,",
    "the septum is fully stretched when the assembly has cooled down @xcite .",
    "the capacitors are as symmetric as possible and they are powered by slightly different voltages issued from the same power supply , with an adjustable voltage ratio thanks to potentiometers .",
    "this arrangement minimizes stark phase noise due to voltage fluctuations of the power supply .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the calculated @xmath36-variation of the electric field @xmath37-component , which is relevant for the hmw phase .",
    "@xmath37 is calculated at the septum surface whereas the atom - septum mean distance is near @xmath38 @xmath3 m but the associated correction is very small @xcite .    the capacitors assembly is inserted in a brass support on which we have coiled @xmath39 mm - diameter enameled copper wires to produce the vertical magnetic field needed for the hmw phase .",
    "we use two rectangular coils , located below and above the interferometer plane , each coil being made of @xmath19 layers and each layer of @xmath40 windings , glued together and to the brass support with a high thermal conductivity glue ( stycast 2850 ft ) . a @xmath19-mm internal diameter copper pipe",
    "is also glued on the brass support at mid - distance between the two coils and with a @xmath41 @xmath42/s flow of tap water ( a low flow rate chosen to minimize vibrations ) , the temperature rise is about @xmath43 k / w .",
    "usually , we apply a current @xmath8 in the coils @xmath44% of the time so that the maximum current @xmath45 a induces a @xmath46 w mean joule power and a temperature rise near @xmath47 k. in figure [ fig2 ] , we have plotted the calculated @xmath36-variation of the magnetic field @xmath48-component which is the one relevant for the hmw phase . as discussed in hmwi , a zeeman phase shift appears if the magnetic field modulus @xmath49 is different on the two interferometer arms , and we have minimized this difference by careful coiling and design of the connection wires geometry .",
    "the hmw interaction region is placed just ahead the second laser standing wave , where the distance between the center of the interferometer arms is largest , close to @xmath50 @xmath3 m . in order not to induce vibrations of the standing wave mirrors ,",
    "the interaction region is suspended from the top of the vacuum chamber .",
    "initial adjustments of the rotation around the horizontal @xmath36-axis and the vertical @xmath51-axis are performed with optical methods .",
    "rotation around @xmath51-axis as well as translation in the @xmath17-direction can be operated under vacuum , and the ultimate tunings are done with the atom interferometer running .",
    "after optimization of the interferometer signal , the mean intensity @xmath10 and the fringe visibility @xmath11 are not modified by the presence of the septum between the two arms .",
    "the magnetic field produced by the hmw coil was measured with a 3d hall probe and compared to the field calculations , showing a good agreement .",
    "concerning the electric field , calibration measurements using the atom interferometer ( described in part [ elec1 ] ) yield an accurate knowledge of each capacitor geometry needed for electric field calculations . with the electric and magnetic field components @xmath37 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath36",
    ", we can calculate the integral @xmath52 and thanks to the very accurate knowledge of the electric polarizability of lithium atom @xcite , we can predict the slope of the hmw phase as a function of @xmath53 product :    @xmath54    where the error bar is due to the uncertainty on the geometrical parameters of the capacitors and of the hmw coil .      in spite of our efforts ,",
    "the magnetic field of the hmw coil is slightly different on the two interferometer arms , with a mean relative difference @xmath55 .",
    "this difference is most probably due to a bad centering of the septum in the hmw coil , with a distance between the coil symmetry plane and the septum of the order of @xmath56 @xmath3 m . for @xmath57 a , the induced zeeman phase shift is equal to @xmath58 rad for the @xmath59 sublevels .",
    "we compensate these phase shifts thanks to a supplementary coil producing an opposite magnetic field gradient along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "this so - called compensator coil is made of @xmath60 turns of copper wire on a @xmath33 mm - diameter aluminium cylinder .",
    "it is located at mid - distance between the first and second laser standing waves , with a mean distance between the compensator coil and the interferometer arms near @xmath47 mm .",
    "this coil is cooled by conduction through its support and temperature rise limits its current @xmath61 to @xmath30 a , if applied only @xmath44% of the time .",
    "then , the magnetic field seen by the atoms is below @xmath62 t , a range for which zeeman effect is linear .      in our previous experiments",
    "@xcite , we deduced the effect of a perturbation by comparing fringe signals successively recorded with and without this perturbation",
    ". the phase measured in the absence of perturbation , which should be constant , drifts with time , typically by several tens of mrad over the few minutes needed for recording a high - quality fringe signal .",
    "these drifts are not linear in time and they are due to minute distortions of the rail supporting the standing wave mirrors .",
    "their magnitude is due to the high sensitivity of the diffraction phase @xmath63 to the mirror positions , with @xmath64 rad/@xmath3 m for m@xmath65 or m@xmath66 and @xmath67 rad/@xmath3 m for m@xmath68 . they were the main limitation of our phase shift measurements . for the present experiment ,",
    "we have almost canceled the sensitivity to these drifts by applying several field configurations during each fringe recording : a field configuration is defined by the @xmath69 values , where @xmath70 is the capacitor mean voltage and @xmath8 the current in the hmw coil ( this current is accompanied by a current @xmath61 in the compensator coil , as explained below ) .",
    "we have used either 4 configurations , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath69 and @xmath73 or 6 configurations , by adding @xmath74 and ( @xmath75 to this list .",
    "a typical fringe recording with @xmath41 configurations is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "a fit of the different fringe signal systems is made using equation ( [ a0 ] ) , where the fringe systems of all configurations share the same value of the diffraction phase @xmath63 .",
    "we thus get the mean intensity @xmath76 , the fringe phase @xmath77 and the fringe visibility @xmath78 for each field configuration . in this way",
    ", we deduce the effects of the application of the electromagnetic field corresponding to each configuration .",
    "@xmath10 is independent of the field configuration , but the visibility and the phase are both modified .",
    "we define a relative visibility and a fringe phase shift for each field configuration by :    @xmath79    @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the fringe relative visibility and phase shift with the electric field only . @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the fringe relative visibility and phase shift with the magnetic field only and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the fringe relative visibility and phase shift with the electric and magnetic fields applied simultaneously . a fringe scan such as shown in figure [ fig3 ] lasts about @xmath46 s , a duration sufficiently small to ensure quasi - linearity of the interferometer phase drift with time ( an exactly linear phase drift only alters @xmath63 and leaves the results of eqs . ( [ a1 ] ) unchanged )",
    "the error bars are about @xmath19% on the relative visibility and @xmath33 mrad on the induced phase shifts .",
    "we repeat about @xmath50 successive fringe scans , taking care that the fringe scan period and the field configuration period are not commensurate , in order to avoid any possible bias in the fits .",
    "the error bars on the averages of such a scan series are near @xmath86% for the relative visibility and near @xmath87 mrad for the phase shifts , small enough to detect fine perturbations of the interference fringe signals and to understand systematic effects .",
    "during calibration measurements , we applied a voltage @xmath70 to one capacitor only , the other one being grounded .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] presents typical results for the fringe visibility @xmath88 and the induced phase shift @xmath89 as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "these measurements were fitted using equations ( 19 - 20 ) and ( 31 ) of hmwi , which yields the value of the parallel speed ratio @xmath91 and the values of the stark phase shifts induced by each capacitor for the mean atom velocity : @xmath92 rad / v@xmath20 and @xmath93 rad / v@xmath20 . using the very accurate theoretical value @xcite of lithium atom electric polarizability @xmath94",
    ", we may deduce the geometrical parameter @xmath95 for both capacitors ( @xmath96 is the capacitor effective length and @xmath97 the plate spacing @xcite ) .",
    "the effective length is the same for both capacitors with a good accuracy , @xmath98 mm , so that these experiments provide measurements of the mean values of the capacitor spacings @xmath99 mm and @xmath100 mm .",
    "when we apply electric fields to both capacitors , with the voltage ratio tuned to cancel the stark phase shift @xmath81 , we observe a residual phase shift due to imperfect tuning : @xmath81 is small and approximately proportional to @xmath90 , but with large fluctuations of the measured value ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we have observed that @xmath81 drifts with time when the interaction region temperature varies : this behavior can be explained by a delay of the expansion of one capacitor with respect to the other one , delay due to the low thermal conductivity of glass . for @xmath101",
    "v , the stark phase induced on each interferometer arm can reach @xmath102 rad .",
    "then , a typical deviation for @xmath81 of @xmath103 rad from its mean value corresponds to a @xmath104 relative variation of the geometrical parameter @xmath95 of one capacitor with respect to the other one .",
    "this variation is somewhat larger than expected for a simple thermal expansion effect with a temperature variation smaller than @xmath47k .",
    "the conclusion is that , because of dispersion and drift , the residual stark phase shift @xmath81 does not carry much useful information .    in the experiments with 6 field configurations",
    ", we can measure the difference of the stark phase shifts for opposite @xmath70 values , with an error bar close to @xmath32 mrad .",

    ". the fitted @xmath112-value , @xmath113 mrad is not explained by eq .",
    "( [ ex0 ] ) but its presence might be due to the use of different power supplies , one per polarity , to produce opposite voltages . the fitted slope @xmath114 mrad / v can be explained by a difference of the mean contact potentials @xmath115 mv :",
    "we may conclude that contact potentials play a very minor role in our experiment and this idea will be supported by further results .",
    "we now discuss the measurements of the relative visibility @xmath116 .",
    "the residual stark phase shift @xmath117 is sufficiently small to neglect any effect of the velocity dispersion on the visibility .",
    "the relative visibility showed highly dependent of the standing wave mirrors alignment .",
    "therefore the collected data for @xmath116 was partitioned into 7 different sets : within a given set , this interferometer alignment is identical for all the data points .",
    "[ fig7 ] presents two of these data sets .",
    "all the sets exhibit different behaviors , but are well independently fitted using the following equation :    @xmath118    as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the relative visibility can become larger than @xmath32 , a result apparently surprising .",
    "this happens when phase dispersions which exist when no interaction is applied , are partially canceled by the phase dispersion due to the application of the electric fields .",
    "the pre - existing phase dispersions originate from the zeeman phase shifts due to the inhomogeneity of the laboratory magnetic field when @xmath119 and from the diffraction phase which presents a spatial dispersion because of an imperfect alignment of the laser standing wave mirrors m@xmath18 .",
    "the application of the electric fields induces an aharonov - casher phase shift and a stark phase shift : the aharonov - casher phase shift is dispersed because of its dependence with the @xmath120 sublevel and the stark phase shift is dispersed because of capacitors defects .",
    "we must describe all these effects , in order to explain the behavior of @xmath116 . assuming a balanced hyperfine population i.e. @xmath121 ( @xmath122 is defined in appendix a of hmwi ) , we use equations ( 23 ) , ( 42 ) and ( 46 - 47 ) of hmwi to evaluate @xmath123 :    @xmath124 \\frac{\\mathcal{v}_{b0}}{\\mathcal{v}_0 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\mbox{with   } \\frac{\\mathcal{v}_{b0}}{\\mathcal{v}_0 } & = & \\frac{1 + \\cos\\left(j_0\\right ) + 2 \\cos\\left(j_0/2\\right)}{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath125 is the dispersion of the diffraction phase and @xmath126 is the visibility modified by the inhomogeneity of the laboratory magnetic field .",

    "the analysis of the experiment revealed more complex than expected , because of stray phases .",
    "the complexity of the signal is due to several factors :    * the signal is the sum of the contributions of 8 sublevels which are not exactly in phase because of the zeeman phase shifts due to the slightly different values of the magnetic field on the two interferometer arms ; * we have built a compensator coil to produce an opposite gradient of the magnetic field at another place in the interferometer . the use of this compensator has been very fruitful as it has enabled us to apply substantially higher fields with a limited loss of fringe visibility .",
    "however the compensator produces a low field , so that it can correct only the part of the phase shifts due to linear zeeman effect ; * the weights of the various @xmath305 sublevels are functions of the laser frequency and power density in the standing waves used for atom diffraction .",
    "we had to control these parameters rather tightly in order to keep these weights almost equal and constant ; * the main phase shifts ( diffraction phase shift , stark and zeeman phase shifts ) present a dispersion with the atomic trajectory described in our calculations by the @xmath51-coordinate . in the presence of several dispersed phase shifts ,",
    "the visibility of the contribution of a given sublevel to the total fringe signal is better or worse , depending if the dispersions of the different phase shifts subtract or add their effects .",

    "are the main possibilities :    * reduction of stray effects by a better construction of the hmw interaction region .",
    "the present construction has two main defects : the difference of the capacitor thicknesses varies with the @xmath51-coordinate and the septum does not coincide with the symmetry plane of the hmw coils .",
    "the construction of capacitors with a better controlled geometry is probably possible but quite difficult , because of the need of using a stretched septum .",
    "a better centering of the septum with respect to the hmw coils is probably rather easy and this would reduce substantially the zeeman phase shifts which are the largest source of complication . *",
    "reduction of stray effects by optical pumping of the atomic beam .",
    "if all the atoms are in one @xmath120 sublevel only , the signal is no more an average on the hyperfine sublevels populations .",

    "this arrangement , which should reduce most of the stray phase shifts , is feasible with minor modifications of our setup and experiments are in progress .",
