    "the first simple difference between dysphonic and healthy voices is shown in fig.[fig : esempio01 ] , where the time evolution of the amplitude of a microphone - registered sound is represented .",
    "the upper panel could be interpreted as a highly noisy time series , but careful investigations reveal that this is not the case : applying a simple low - pass filter would only introduce a distortion bigger than the original noise level .",
    "some of the noise - like structures belong to the time series and one has to be able to correctly identify what is worth keeping and what has to be eliminated during the correction procedure .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", this paper relies on the theory of dynamical systems and deterministic chaos ; the former implies that the time evolution is defined in some phase space , the latter offers a striking explanation for irregular behaviour and anomalies in systems which do not seem to be inherently stochastic .",
    "even very simple chaotic dynamical systems can exhibit strongly irregular time evolution without random inputs .",
    "consider for a moment a purely deterministic system .",
    "once its present state is fixed , the states at all future times are determined as well .",
    "thus it will be important to establish a vector space , the so - called _ phase space _",
    ", for the system such that specifying a point in this space specifies the state of the system , and vice versa .",
    "this implies that we can study the dynamics of the system by studying the dynamics of the corresponding phase space points .",
    "unfortunately what we observe in an experiment is not a phase space object but a time series , most likely only a scalar sequence of measurements .",
    "we therefore have to convert the observations into state vectors : this is the problem of _ phase space reconstruction _ which is technically solved by the method of delays or related constructions @xcite .",
    "most commonly , the time series is a sequence of scalar measurements of some quantity which depends on the current state of the system , considered at multiples of a fixed sampling time : @xmath0 namely we look at the system through some measurement function @xmath1 and make observations only up to some random fluctuations @xmath2 , the measurement noise .",
    "delay reonstruction _ in @xmath3 dimensions is then formed by the vectors @xmath4 , given as @xmath5 the time difference in number of samples @xmath6 or in time units @xmath7 between adjacent components of the delay vectors is referred to as the _ lag _ or _ delay time_.    a number of embedding theorems are concerned with the question under which circumstances and to what extent the geometrical object formed by the vectors @xmath4 is equivalent to the original trajectory @xmath8 .",
    "here equivalent means that they can be mapped onto each other by a uniquely invertible smooth map and , under quite general circumstances the attractor formed by @xmath4 is equivalent to the attractor in the unknown space in which the original system is living if the dimension @xmath3 of the delay coordinate space is sufficiently large .",
    "human voices form an aperiodic and highly nonstationary signal .",
    "a sentence can be decomposed in subunits , called phonemes , which can be considered as different types of dynamics .",
    "careful investigation of time and length scales shows that the sound wave characterizing a single phoneme ( duration between 50 and 200 ms ) has a characteristic profile ( _ pitch _ ) of about 5 - 15 ms .",
    "a kind of phase angle on this highly nontrivial oscillation will then identify the instantaneous amplitude .",
    "thus a delay reconstruction should allow us to identify the actual phoneme and the phase inside it .",
    "looking at the eq.[eq : embedd ] one realizes that at least two parameters are involved in the delay reconstruction from a scalar time series , namely @xmath3 and @xmath6 . some recipes for an optimal tuning of them are available at the moment , but an adequate theory is still missing ; in any case , a good tool is represented by the _ recurrence plot _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this method was used for the first time to study recurrencies and nonstationary behaviour occurring in dynamical systems .",
    "it allows to identify system properties that can not be observed using other linear and nonlinear approaches and it is especially useful for analysis of nonstationary systems with high dimensional and/or noisy dynamics .",
    "recurrence plots are constructed on the basis of mutual distances between point belonging to the same trajectory . in the plane of indices",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 a dot is printed whenever the delay vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 fulfill the relation @xmath13 .",
    "so a recurrence plot depends also on the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the fig.[fig : recurrence ] proves that our delay vectors really represent meaningful states , where the line structure shows the approximate periodicity inside the phonemes and the number of intraphoneme neighbours .",
    "the distance between two consecutive lines indicates the duration of the basic structure ( _ pitch _ ) inside a phoneme .",
    "we can see from fig.[fig : recurrence ] that this involves approximately 200 points .",
    "considering that the sentence has been sampled at a 22,05 khz rate , this implies a profile of about 9 ms . in order to correctly identify such a structure , in the delay reconstruction of eq.[eq : embedd ] ,",
    "the product @xmath15 ( the so - called _ time window _ ) has to be bigger than 200 .",
    "a more detailed insight into the role of this two parameters is given in ref .",
    "noise reduction means that one tries to decompose a time series into two components , one containing the signal , the other random fluctuations .",
    "implicitly we always assume that the data represents an additive superposition of two different components which have to be distinguishable through some objective criterion .",
    "the classical statistical tool for obtaining this distinction is the power spectrum .",
    "random noise has a flat , or at least a broad , spectrum , whereas periodic or quasi - periodic signals have sharp spectral lines .",
    "after both components have been identified in the spectrum , a wiener filter can be used to separate the time series accordingly .",
    "this approach fails for our purposes here because the undesirable part of the signal is not what is usually considered to be noise .",
    "it is very strongly correlated to the clean part of the signal , indeed it is part of the signal .",
    "even if parts of the spectrum can be clearly associated with the signal , a separation into signal and noise fails for most parts of the frequency domain .",
    "the filter we use has been proposed in @xcite and arises from the chaotic deterministic systems field , where the determinism yields a criterion to distinguish the signal and the noise ( which is supposed not to be deterministic ) .",
    "let the time evolution of the signal be deterministic with an unknown map @xmath16 .",
    "all that we have knowledge of are noisy measurements of this signal :    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the scalar time series we can measure , @xmath19 the clean signal and @xmath2 the superimposed noise . in order to obtain an estimate @xmath20 for the value of @xmath21 we form delay vectors @xmath22 and determine those which are close to @xmath23 .",
    "the average value of @xmath24 is then used as a cleaned value @xmath20 :    @xmath25    here @xmath26 denotes the number of elements of the neighbourhood @xmath27 of radius @xmath14 around the point @xmath23 , which is never empty , no matter how small a value of @xmath14 we choose : it always contains at least @xmath23 .",
    "this is good to know since we have to make some choice of @xmath14 when we use this algorithm .",
    "it is guaranteed that if we choose @xmath14 too small the worst thing that can happen is that the only neighbour found is @xmath23 itself .",
    "this , however , yields the estimate @xmath28 which just means that no correction is made at all .    to get an impression of how the local projective noise reduction scheme works , assume that one has to eliminate noise from music stored on an old - fashioned long playing record , induced by scratches on the black disc",
    "the task becomes almost trivial if one can make use of several samples of this lp .",
    "when playing them synchronously , the signal part of the different tracks i d identical , whereas the noise part is independent : as a consequence of that , already a simple averaging would enhance the sound quality . in deterministic chaotic signals , this redundancy is stored in the past : similar initial conditions will behave in a similar way , at least for short periods . in human voice signals there is no need to suppose a chaotic behavior , since every phoneme is made up of pitches in an almost periodic fashion .",
    "this means that every logical unit provides all the redundancy required for its filtering .",
    "how can we make sure that all we do is to reduce noise without distorting the signal ?",
    "in fig.[fig : esempio01 ] two typical time series , one related to a healthy voice , the other to a sick one , are compared . in the lower panel we can see the recurrence of structures of length approximately 9 ms inside a phoneme , in total agreement with the recurrence plot analysis .",
    "the person who has spoken this sentence is absolutely healthy and the corresponding signal looks very clean .",
    "the same repetition is not that clear in the upper panel , where a patient affected by a t1a glottis cancer was asked to say the same group of words in the same environmental conditions , namely in a professional quiet room .",
    "the signal looks very noisy , but listening to it one perceives only the sick voice and no indication of noise , at least of what one usually means saying noise .",
    "spectral analyses show the same result : the vocal disorder reveals itself as a noisy signal , but the nature of this noise is not the conventional one .",
    "it is not addivite and it is correlated with the other sub - part of the sentence one would like to isolate . in @xcite",
    "it is shown how some of the complexities observed in disordered voices are not caused by random external input to the vocal apparatus , but by the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of vocal fold movement .",
    "normal phonation corresponds to an essentially synchronized motion of all vibratory modes .",
    "a change of parameters such as muscle tension or localised vocal fold lesions may lead to a desynchronization of certain modes resulting in the appearance of these new features that look like noise .",
    "the distinction of the signal in a deterministic part and in a stochastic component is then not possible .",
    "nevertheless one would still like to extract the main structure from the signal , suppressing the noise - like features .",
    "for this purpose the previously described filter is worth applying to correct the disorders : if we choose suitably the involved parameters we are able to identify the structures inside a phoneme and to perform an average of them via eq.[eq : filtro ] .",
    "every point belonging to a structure is replaced by a local average of similar points coming from different structures ( this is done searching for neighbours in the embedding space ) .",
    "the resulting signal does not show just an exact repetition of these parts because the averaging procedure acts only locally and the points involved in the computation varies from structure to structure .",
    "also in a normal signal , in fact , the repetitions are not perfect .",
    "one has then to be careful when choosing the @xmath14 : a too big value would result in a drastic averaging and the resulting signal would sound too artificial . on the other hand",
    "a small value of @xmath14 is not able to perform any correction . in fig.[fig : esempio02 ] we show what happens when using the filter with a _ good _ set of parameters : the main shape of the sub - structures is preserved , but the noise - like features are attenuated .",
    "the meaning of good here is the following : the recurrence plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : recurrence ] shows that the system generating the time series we are analyzing really possesses dynamical regimes . since we want to be able to distinguish between different states , the vectors @xmath4 of the delay reconstruction has to comprise all the points belonging to a pitch .",
    "so the product @xmath15 of the lag and the embedding dimension has to be approximately 200 in the example depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : recurrence ] . a choice of a big @xmath3 results on big computational efforts ; on the other hand a big @xmath6 produces worse results .",
    "we refer again to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is used for the neighbourood relations between vectors in the embedding space .",
    "we draw a point in @xmath29 on the recurrence plot if @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath14 has to be bigger than the noise level . a good way to tune",
    "it is through the recurrence plot : whit a small @xmath14 we get almost no recurrences , a very big @xmath14 is such that the relation @xmath13 is fulfilled from almost all the vector pairs .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath14 is mirrored on a recurrence plot where the lines are as long as possible , as thin as possible and all the recurrences belong to lines .",
    "if we tune the parameters according to this recipe , the filtered signal sounds more _ normal _ than the original , even if some characteristic aspect of the voice has been lost . in the horizontal axis of fig.[fig : esempio02 ] we report the index of the time series in order to show the number of points involved in the filtering procedure .",
    "every structure lasts 80 points ; in a space of such a dimensionality , the vector having these elements as components is represented as a single point .",
    "the four structures of fig.[fig : esempio02 ] are neighbours because the involved sequences of points are approximately the same . as shown in @xcite , it is not necessary to consider such a big space , but one can skip some intermediate point , taking care to cover the full structure in any case .",
    "we are dealing with three categories of subjects : ( i ) patients affected by t1a glottis cancer , a tumour confined to the glottis region with mobility of the vocal cords ( ii ) healthy patients and ( iii ) patients under medical treatment , operated via endoscopic laser or traditional lancet technique .",
    "the sentence spoken by all of them is the italian word _ aiuole _",
    "( flower - beds ) , since it contains a lot of vowels : patients suffering from dysphonia need a great effort in saying this word .    to classify the sentences we make use of the feature space introduced in @xcite , whose components are special quantities extracted from the time series : spectral factor , pseudo - entropy , pseudo - correlation dimension , first zero - crossing of the autocorrelation function , first lyapunov exponent , prediction error , jitter , shimmer , peaks in the phoneme transition , residual noise .",
    "it is not necessary here to go into details , one has just to know that this space represents the proper object where a good classification of vocal pathologies is feasible .    in fig.[fig :",
    "corr4 ] we see a projection of the feature space onto the spectral factor and the pseudo - entropy dimensions ; we can see how healthy and sick patients populate different regions and which are the results of the medical treatments performed on four patients ( indicated by a bold cross ) .",
    "unfortunately we do nt have samples from the same treated people before the surgical operation , so that it is not possible to link the four cases directly to the pre - operatory phase .",
    "the dotted lines link the points before the filtering to the points after the attenuation of the noise - like features .",
    "we can force the algorithm to perform a stronger filtering of the dysphonic time series ( as explained in the appendix , this is possible increasing the number of iteration of the correction routine ) , but one has always to be careful : in order to get a better value of some components of the feature space , one has to come to a compromise with some other quantities and the best answer comes , as usual in these cases , from a direct listening of the time series ( after the convertion in a _",
    ".wav _ format ) .",
    "the results shown in fig.[fig : corr4 ] have been obtained with the following set of parameters : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the variance of the original data .",
    "dysphonic patients , in the ( spectral factor , pseudo - entropy ) plane , are spread around the average point ( 5,1.8 ) ; the centre of mass of the healthy cluster is ( 35,0.5 ) .",
    "the surgical treatment produces an average correction located in ( 20,0.6 ) .",
    "our software moves the centre of mass of sick patients to ( 15,0.7 ) . in getting these results the value of @xmath3 and @xmath6",
    "is not so crucial , provided that @xmath34 , being @xmath35 the extension of a pitch .",
    "the program is more sensitive to the choice of @xmath14 , in the following way : the length of the dotted line of fig.[fig : corr4 ] is somehow proportional to the value of @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately the angle is not constant : this means that up to a certain value of @xmath14 all the corrections act along the same direction , beyond that threshold they start to deteriorate the voice . in the extreme case of @xmath14 as big as the full embedding space , the averaging procedure performed by eq .",
    "[ eq : filtro ] would destroy almost completely the signal ( producing a pseudo - entropy and a spectral factor close to zero ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the program to the choice of @xmath14 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : correps ] .",
    "there we have filtered one sample with 8 different values of the neighbourood size .",
    "the original position is the one with the biggest value of the pseudo - entropy .",
    "@xmath14 is increasing along the direction indicated by the arrow and only for two values of it the corrected point lies in the healthy region .",
    "for the last three corrections the neighbourood size was absolutely too big .",
    "the other samples behave in a qualitatively similar way .",
    "to summarize , we have proposed a procedure to correct numerically some kind of vocal disorders .",
    "the main ingredients are the theory of dynamical systems , the delay reconstruction from a scalar measurement , the method of recurrence plot and a nonlinear noise reduction scheme .",
    "we also make use of a feature space in order to visualize the results of the filtering procedure . a detailed description of how the idea has been implemented is also provided in appendix .",
    "we have discussed the meaning , implications , methodology and mathematical background of the most relevant parameters and the sensitivity of the program to their choice .",
    "the software corrections perform an improvement on the voice quality that is comparable to what a surgical operation is able to do .",
