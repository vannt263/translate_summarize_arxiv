    "a great deal of work has been done recently to embed the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) into a brane construction @xcite .",
    "this research is part of the effort , initiated in @xcite , to build a fully realistic four dimensional vacuum out of string theory .",
    "while the original models were formulated in the framework of the heterotic string , the most recent efforts were formulated for type ii strings in order to take advantage of the recent work on moduli stabilization using fluxes .",
    "such brane constructions naturally lead to extra anomalous @xmath3 s in the four dimensional low - energy theory and , in turn , to the presence of possible heavy @xmath4 particles in the spectrum .",
    "these particles should be among the early findings of lhc and besides for the above cited models they are also a prediction of many other theoretical models of the unification of forces ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is then of some interest to know if these @xmath4 particles contribute to the cancelation of the gauge anomaly in the way predicted from string theory or not . in @xcite",
    "some of the present authors have studied a supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in which the anomaly is canceled _  la _ green - schwarz .",
    "the model is only string - inspired and is not the low - energy sector of some brane construction .",
    "the reason of this choice rests in our curiosity to explore the phenomenology of these models keeping a high degree of flexibility , while avoiding the intricacies and uncertainties connected with a string theory construction . for previous work along these lines we refer to @xcite-@xcite . in this work",
    "we perform a consistency check of our model @xcite by evaluating the thermal relic density and comparing it against the wmap data .",
    "the cancelation of the @xmath0 anomaly in our model requires the introduction of an extra complex scalar field whose supersymmetric partner is called the stckelino .",
    "we will see in the following that if the latter is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) its interactions are such to define it as an xwimp ( i.e. a weakly interacting particle with couplings at least one order of magnitude less than the standard weak interactions ) : in fact it will also turn out to be a cold relic .",
    "if the stckelino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , its relic density turns out to be too high with respect to the experimental data .",
    "this is why , following @xcite , we favor a next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) with a mass close to the lsp .",
    "we show that an interesting scenario arises also for three particle coannihilation processes . in these two cases ,",
    "the model is consistent with the experimental data .",
    "moreover in the three particle case we find configurations in which the lsp and the nlsp do not need to be nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "in this case the mass gap between the two can be of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "this is the plan of the paper : in section 2 we describe our model . in section 3 and 4",
    "we find the lsp and study the stckelino interactions .",
    "finally in section 5 we compute the relic density .",
    "section 6 is a summary of our results .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss our theoretical framework .",
    "we assume an extension of the mssm with an additional abelian vector multiplet @xmath6 with arbitrary charges .",
    "the anomalies are canceled with the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism and with the generalized chern - simons ( gcs ) terms .",
    "all the details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "all the mssm fields are charged under the additional vector multiplet @xmath6 , with charges which are given in table  [ qtable ] , where @xmath7 are the left handed quarks and leptons respectively while @xmath8 are the right handed up and down quarks and the electrically charged leptons .",

    "all the anomalies that involve only the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 factors vanish identically .",
    "however , triangles with @xmath0 in the external legs in general are potentially anomalous .",

    "several scenarios can be considered for the nlsp .",
    "we can split them into two major classes : one in which the nlsp is either a pure bino or a pure wino , and thus a coannihilation with a third mssm particle is needed in order to recover the wmap result , and one in which the nlsp is a generic mssm neutralino with a non - negligible bino and/or wino component . in both classes in order to have effective coannihilations , the nlsp ( and eventually the other mssm particle involved in the coannihilation process ) must be almost degenerate in mass . furthermore , in the most common applications , the cross sections for the annihilations of the the lsp and the nlsp and that of the coannihilations between the lsp and nslp are roughly of the same order of magnitude . in our case this last condition will be stretched and the cross section we are going to discuss will differ for some orders of magnitude .",
