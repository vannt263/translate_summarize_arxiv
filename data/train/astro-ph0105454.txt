    "our understanding of the cosmic history of galaxy clusters is slowly maturing due to an ever growing series of observations including faint spectroscopic data ( especially those obtained at the keck and vlt observatories ) , deep optical and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging from the ground and in space , morphological data from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and constraints on the evolution of the intracluster medium ( icm ) from rosat , asca , and xmm . when such observations are applied to complete , objectively derived catalogs of clusters , the constraints placed on cluster formation and evolution scenarios can become quite confined .",
    "cluster evolution is inherently complex both because clusters are not closed systems and because the 3 main mass components ( dark matter , icm , and galaxies ) evolve differently . as a consequence ,",
    "different cluster parameters evolve on different timescales depending on the thermal and dissipative properties of the mass component(s ) which most strongly control each cluster parameter .    the properties of clusters at redshifts as low as @xmath21 ( lookback times of @xmath22 the present age of the universe ) already exhibit significant departures from their current epoch counterparts .",
    "the broad - band color distribution of the early - type galaxy population show significant bluing ; the observed trend is consistent with passive stellar evolution and a relatively well synchronized initial starburst epochs occurring at @xmath23 ( aragn - salamanca 1993 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1995 ; ellis 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , the relative abundance and the spectral characteristics of the disk galaxies in clusters appear to have evolved significantly over the last third of a hubble time ( dressler 1997 ; poggianti 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , the infall and processing of disk galaxies in clusters appears to continue right up to the present day ( adami et al .",
    "however , even at @xmath21 the properties of cluster galaxies are noticeably different from those in the surrounding field .    at redshifts of @xmath24 ,",
    "the study of massive clusters provides particularly important constraints on the physical processes that dominate the formation of their member galaxies ( and on cosmological parameters ) because the amplitude of evolutionary effects and the differences between competing theories are quite large ( bower , kodama , & terlevich 1998 ) . the observations of clusters at @xmath25 that exist today are limited to a handful of clusters , largely because so few systems are known .",
    "while new distant cluster surveys will remedy this lack of targets ( gladders 2000 ; postman 2001 ; gonzales 2001 ) , several intriguing observations of existing systems already suggest that the @xmath26 epoch is one at which clusters and their member galaxies exhibit significant differences from their descendants at @xmath27 .",
    "for example , there is evidence that a significant fraction of the early type galaxies in ms-1054 ( @xmath28 ) are merging  something that is not seen in the vast majority of current epoch cluster ellipticals  and which results in a significant increase in the scatter in their color  magnitude relation relative to what is observed at @xmath29 ( van dokkum 2000 ) .",
    "the fraction of cluster galaxies with evidence for active star formation is also significantly higher at @xmath30 ( @xmath31% ) than the fraction at the current epoch or even @xmath32 ( postman , lubin , & oke 1998 ) . at the same time , the global properties of the icm seem well established even by @xmath33 as there appears to be little evolution observed in the @xmath34 relation out to these redshifts ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; donahue 1998 ) , although the fraction of clusters with asymmetric x - ray gas and asymmetric galaxy surface density distributions increases noticeably ( lubin & postman 1996 ; gioia 1999 ) .",
    "it is quite important , therefore , to conduct statistically complete spectroscopic and photometric surveys of many @xmath26 clusters , covering as broad a range in global cluster properties as possible , in order to understand the breadth of the physics associated with cluster galaxy formation and evolution and , in particular , how the cluster environment modifies the path of galaxy evolution .",
    "focusing solely on one component of the cluster population ( ellipticals ) will only reveal part of the story and may even result in a biased interpretation of the timescales for galaxy formation ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) . in 1995 , we began an extensive spectroscopic and imaging program to study nine candidate clusters of galaxies at @xmath35 ( oke , postman & lubin 1998 ; hereafter paper i ) in an attempt to establish an evolutionary reference sample of clusters analogous to the morphs survey performed at @xmath36 ( smail 1997 ) .",
    "our sole spectroscopic target selection criterion is the galaxy s @xmath37-band magnitude .",
    "no color selection is applied in order to assure that a broad range of cluster galaxy types are included in the survey .",
    "the clusters themselves span a relatively broad range in x - ray luminosity and richness .    in this paper , we present our measurements and interpretations of the kinematic and spectrophotometric properties of the galaxies in the clusters  ( @xmath38 ) ,  ( @xmath39 ) , and ( @xmath40 )  the three most massive systems in our survey .",
    "is of particular interest because its comoving spatial separation from the better known cluster  is about 15 mpc and their cosmologically corrected radial velocity separation is 4350 .",
    "lubin ( 2000 ) provide extensive observational evidence that suggests  and  are indeed two members of a rich supercluster .",
    "some of the spectrophotometric and kinematic results for  have already been published ( postman , lubin , & oke 1998 ; hereafter paper ii ) along with a study of the morphological properties of its galaxy population ( lubin 1998 ; hereafter paper iii ) . here",
    "we provide both new and improved constraints on the cluster mass estimates , on the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function , and on the spectral characteristics , star formation rates , and stellar population ages of galaxies for all three of the above clusters in this paper . a separate paper ( lubin 2001 ) will present results on the morphological make - up of the cluster galaxies and on the relationship between galaxy morphology and local density in these clusters .    a brief summary of the observations is presented in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "our measurements of the cluster masses and mass - to - light ratios are presented in  [ sec : mtl ] and our constraints on the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function ( using both our cluster and field samples ) are included in  [ sec : lfevol ] .",

    "analyses of the star formation rates , stellar population ages , and an improved estimate of the fraction of active galaxies in these clusters are contained in  [ sec : emlsfr ] and the correlation of these properties with clustocentric radius is described in  [ sec : clstruc ] .",

    "the photometric and spectroscopic observations of , , and  were conducted using the low resolution imaging spectrograph at the w. m. keck observatory ( oke 1995 ) .",
    "we provide a brief description of the observations below but refer the reader to paper i for the full details and to paper ii for the specifics on observations of .",
    "broadband @xmath46 images of  and  were acquired during a series of observing runs spread over a 3 year period ( march 1994 through august 1997 ) and were obtained under photometric conditions .",
    "we use the sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) source detection and classification package to generate object positions , classifications , and aperture photometry from the reduced images .",
    "this differs from our work in paper ii where we used the focas ( valdes 1982 ) package .",
    "the aperture photometry from sextractor is more accurate than that from focas because sextractor employs pixel masks to exclude light from sources surrounding the object being photometered .",
    "we have also reprocessed the image data from  through the sextractor package to enable consistent comparisons with the clusters and .",
    "the sextractor detection parameters were set to match the focas parameters described in paper i. the fwhm of the psf in the images is @xmath47 for , , and , respectively .",
    "a fixed aperture diameter of 6.0@xmath48 was used to compute the aperture photometry .",
    "this diameter corresponds to projected metric radii of 21.7 65 kpc and 22.965 kpc at @xmath49 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this aperture choice is consistent with that used for faint galaxy photometry in other intermediate redshift cluster analyses ( _ e.g. _ , aragn - salamanca 1993 , smail , ellis & fitchett 1994 , barger 1996 ) .",
    "the number of objects detected and measured is 4952 , 3905 , and 6322 in , , and , respectively .",
    "not all objects are detected in all four passbands partly because , in some cases , small positional offsets exist between the various filter images whenever the data were obtained on separate observing runs .",
    "the number of objects detected refers to only those objects that are detected in _ at least _ two of the four bands .",
    "spectroscopic target selection , however , is based solely on an object s @xmath50band magnitude ( see  [ sec : spec ] below ) .",
    "we also note that all spectroscopically confirmed cluster members are detected in at least 3 of the four passbands so the choice to catalog objects in the above way does not hinder our study of the cluster galaxy populations .",
    "each object is assigned a keck identification number ( based on its location in a declination - ordered catalog ) for convenient referencing .",
    "there is a very bright star ( v @xmath51 10.3 ) in the southern part of the  and objects within @xmath52 of the star are not photometrically analyzed or classified .",
    "all @xmath46 magnitudes have been converted to absolute ab magnitudes using the relations given in paper i. models show that the relation between ab magnitude and log @xmath53 , where @xmath53 is the observed effective frequency of each broadband filter , is nearly linear with a small curvature that changes sign when proceeding from hot to cool stellar populations .",
    "we have , thus , chosen to characterize the observed broadband energy distributions by the slope , hereafter referred to as the slope @xmath54 , of a linear least squares fit to the measured ab magnitude as a function of log @xmath53 .",
    "the slope @xmath54 provides a more robust indicator of the overall broadband sed than any individual color measure such as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 .",
    "the slope @xmath54 of the cluster and field galaxies are shown as a function of @xmath37 magnitude in figure  [ figcc ] for the , , and  fields .",
    "spectroscopically confirmed cluster members are indicated by the filled symbols .",
    "the distributions in slope @xmath54 are very similar for both cluster and field galaxies ; there is only a hint of the red color ridge normally seen in similar plots of clusters at redshifts near 0.5 .",
    "the lack of a strong red envelope is a consequence of the rest wavelengths of the optical bands used and the relatively young age of the cluster galaxies .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this result is provided in  [ sec : redenv ] .",
    "spectra were obtained using several slit masks ( 7 for , 6 for ) for galaxies in the range @xmath58 ( the precise magnitude limits are 23.45 for  and 23.60 for ) .",
    "the bright limit was imposed to avoid saturating the detector .",
    "the galaxies observed spectroscopically are distributed over a @xmath59 region centered on each cluster . using the procedures described in paper i , we succeeded in obtaining redshifts for 88% of the objects observed .",
    "table 1 summarizes the yields and figure  [ figzcomp ] shows our redshift success rate as a function of @xmath37 magnitude . failure to measure a redshift is mostly due to insufficient signal - to - noise ratio , but occasionally we do encounter good s / n spectra with no identifiable features",
    ". some of the latter spectra may be very low redshift objects without significant absorption or emission features redwards of 5000  in the rest frame . in",
    "there is one qso or agn , keck # 3933 , with a redshift of 1.0750 . in , keck # 1339",
    "is the sole qso at a redshift of 2.4970 .",
    "tables 2 , 3 , and 4 provide the key photometric and spectroscopic parameters for all galaxies with measured redshifts for the survey fields centered on , , and .",
    "the keck object identification number is given in column 1 and if the number is preceeded by an asterisk then the galaxy is considered to be a member of the cluster ( see  [ sec : mtl ] for details ) .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxy in each case is denoted by a double asterisk .",
    "we note that the identification numbers used in paper ii for  differ from those in table 3 because we used different object detection software .",
    "the absolute ab magnitudes in our 4 passbands , @xmath60 , are given in columns 2 through 5 .",
    "geocentric redshifts and our measure of the redshift quality ( see paper i ) are given in columns 6 and 7 .",
    "the slope @xmath54 ( defined above in units of ab mag per unit interval of log @xmath53 ) is listed in column 8 .",
    "the contents of the remaining columns are described in subsequent sections .",
    "as in paper ii , we derive cluster masses based on three popular virial theorem mass estimators : the traditional pairwise mass estimator , m@xmath61 , the projected mass estimator , m@xmath62 ( bahcall & tremaine 1981 ; heisler , tremaine , & bahcall 1985 ) , and the ring - wise mass estimator , m@xmath63 ( carlberg 1996 ) .",
    "the mathematical definitions of these estimators are given in equations 2  6 in paper ii .",
    "each estimator has its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the m@xmath61 estimate does not require one to specify a cluster center .",
    "however m@xmath62 and m@xmath63 , which do require a center to be defined , tend to be much more robust against interlopers .",
    "the radial cluster velocity dispersion , a necessary parameter in virial mass estimation , is accurately determined from the redshifts for @xmath64 cluster members in each system .",
    "velocity dispersions are computed by first defining a broad redshift range , typically @xmath65 , in which to conduct the calculations .",
    "this range is manually chosen to be centered on the approximate redshift of the cluster .",
    "we then compute the bi - weight mean and dispersion of the velocity distribution ( beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) and identify the galaxy with the largest deviation from the mean .",
    "velocity offsets from the mean are taken to be @xmath66 which corrects for cosmological and relativistic effects . in the case of bi - weight statistics",
    ", @xmath67 is the median of the distribution .",
    "if the galaxy with the largest velocity deviation differs from the bi - weight median by either more than 3@xmath68 or by more than 3500 km s@xmath42 , it is excluded , and the computations are redone .",
    "the procedure continues until no further galaxies satisfy the above criteria .",
    "the 3500 km s@xmath42 limit is based on extensive data available for low @xmath69 clusters .",
    "for example , 95% of the galaxies within the central 4.665 mpc region of the coma cluster and with @xmath70 km s@xmath42 lie within @xmath71 km s@xmath42 of the mean coma redshift .",
    "this clipping procedure is conservative and does not impose a gaussian distribution on the final redshift distribution ( see _ e.g. , _ cl0023 + 0423 in paper ii ) .",
    "figure  [ figvdisp ] shows histograms of the velocity offsets relative to the mean cluster redshifts for the three clusters .",
    "the derived kinematic parameters , including the mean @xmath69 , dispersion , and mass estimates , are provided in table 5 . for each cluster , we give the results using all available redshift data ( no radius limit ) , as well as the results for those galaxies within the central 385 and 77065 kpc regions . the radially limited results are used to derive central mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios .",
    "the results for  were originally published in paper ii , but we include them here for convenience .",
    "the derived masses within the central 77065 kpc regions of these 3 clusters are all in excess of @xmath465 m@xmath5 ( for the m@xmath61 estimator ) and the projected and ring - wise mass estimators yield central values @xmath7265 m@xmath5 . each of the clusters has also been detected in x - rays by rosat ( castander 1994 ) , providing further evidence that these clusters have developed deep potential wells .",
    "the @xmath73 kev x - ray luminosities are @xmath7465 erg s@xmath42 , @xmath7565 erg s@xmath42 , and @xmath76 4.09 @xmath7765 erg s@xmath42 ( 3@xmath68 upper limit ) for , , and , respectively",
    ". however , based on the local @xmath78 relation ( edge & stewart 1991 ) , these x - ray luminosities are low for the derived velocity dispersions .",
    "similar trends have been seen in other studies of intermediate redshift ( @xmath79 ) clusters ( couch 1991 ; holden 1997 ; gioia 1999 ) suggesting that these systems are dynamically young and , consequently , the relationship between the temperature of their x - ray emitting icm and their total gravitational mass is still undergoing significant evolution .    the central @xmath80 mass - to - light ratios , in solar units , for these clusters are given in table 6 using the projected mass estimate , @xmath81 , from table 5 .",
    "the errors shown include the formal uncertainties in both the mass and luminosity estimates but do not include any systematic error estimates .",
    "the cluster luminosities are computed as described in  3.2 of paper ii .",
    "the m / l values in table 6 are based on a non - evolving cluster luminosity function .",
    "if we assume that @xmath82 evolves as @xmath83 ( lilly 1995 ; see also  [ sec : lfevol ] ) , the m / l ratios increase by about 10% , relative to the non - evolving calculation .",
    "the dependence on the evolution of @xmath82 is through the correction applied to the total luminosity for the assumed missing faint end of the cluster luminosity function ( see equation 8 in paper ii ) .",
    "systematic errors in the m / l ratios can be significant , however , because virial equilibrium may not be fully achieved [ small ( 1998 ) have shown worst case overestimates in the virial mass by a factor of 2 can occur for marginally bound systems ] and because the background subtraction is performed statistically , which can be problematic at high redshifts as the light from foreground sources dominates .",
    "we minimize this latter effect by confining the luminosity computation to galaxies with apparent magnitudes spanning the range defined by the spectroscopically confirmed members . a correction must still be applied to this luminosity sum , however , to reflect an integration to a common fiducial absolute luminosity , taken to be @xmath84 + 5log@xmath8565 in this case .",
    "the central m / l ratios for these three distant clusters are consistent , in mean and scatter , with those seen in their local counterparts ( girardi 2000 ) covering a range of @xmath8665 , a range inconsistent with an @xmath87 cosmology ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , significant evolution in the m / l ratio on cluster scales is easily masked by the above systematic errors .",
    "a more robust measurement of the m / l ratios for these 3 clusters requires substantially more spectroscopic and morphological data than is presently available .",
    "the 321 galaxies in these 3 fields with redshifts in the range @xmath89 allow us to accurately constrain the evolution of the rest ab @xmath15-band galaxy luminosity function over the last @xmath90 of a hubble time .",
    "the @xmath15-band is chosen , as in paper ii , to eliminate or minimize any extrapolation in the calculation of a rest - frame absolute luminosity .",
    "we relate apparent and absolute magnitude using the formalism of equations 6 , 9 , and 10 in gunn & oke ( 1975 ) .",
    "this relation becomes :    @xmath91\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is given in equation 9 of gunn & oke ( 1975 ) .",
    "the best - fit stellar evolution model to the observed @xmath46 ab magnitudes ( see  [ sec : modcompare ] ) is then used to calculate the absolute magnitude at the rest @xmath15 wavelength from the above expression . the absolute magnitude in this band",
    "is hereafter referred to as @xmath93 . for redshifts of @xmath94",
    "the redshifted @xmath15 filter position is within the observed wavelength range , and an interpolation of the best - fit evolutionary model can be made .",
    "above @xmath2 the rest - frame @xmath15 filter wavelength is above the observed @xmath95 band , and an extrapolation is necessary .",
    "this is done using the best - fit evolutionary model and extrapolating to the appropriate frequency .",
    "however , 90% of the galaxies in our @xmath16 sample lie below @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty in the resulting absolute ab can be estimated from the uncertainty in the fit of the observations to the model .",
    "the luminosity function is computed in three redshift bins : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . because the latter bin contains the cluster members , we explicitly compute the field and cluster luminosity functions separately for the @xmath98 interval .",
    "each galaxy is weighted by the inverse of @xmath99 to account for malmquist bias and by the inverse of the selection function ( shown as the dashed curve in figure  [ figzcomp ] ) to account for the objects for which no redshift was measured .",
    "the latter correction assumes that the unmeasured galaxies have the same redshift distribution as a function of apparent @xmath37 magnitude as those that do have measured redshifts .",
    "a maximum likelihood method is then used to find the best fit schechter form luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "because our redshift survey extends only 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the characteristic magnitude , @xmath100 , we constrain the faint end slope of the luminosity function to have a value of @xmath101 ( marzke 1998 ) . figure  [ figlffit ] shows the observations and the best fits for the field galaxy luminosity functions in the three redshift bins .",
    "the best - fit @xmath100 values ( 65 = 1 ) and other relevant details about each redshift bin are provided in table 7 .    the evolution of the @xmath15-band luminosity function is shown in figure  [ figlfevol ] . in this figure",
    "we plot the best fit values of @xmath100 as a function of redshift .",
    "the horizontal errors are just set by the width of each bin in redshift space .",
    "two simple models for the evolution of the characteristic magnitude are shown .",
    "our data are consistent with an evolution of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "such evolution is consistent with that reported for blue field galaxies over the range @xmath104 ( lilly 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath100 derived for the cluster members is 0.3 mag brighter than that for field galaxies in the range @xmath98 .",
    "this is expected because the cluster sample includes many luminous early type galaxies which are rarely found in low density environments .",
    "the cluster @xmath100 at @xmath105 is approximately 0.7 mag brighter than that derived for clusters at @xmath106 ( colless 1989 ; lumsden 1997 ; valotto 1997 ; rauzy 1998 ) .",
    "in order to derive constraints on the  ages \" of the galaxies in our survey , we use the 1996 stellar evolution models of bruzual & charlot ( hereafter bc96 ; see bruzual & charlot 1993 ) because absolute energy distributions can be generated over a broad wavelength range , extending far below the lyman limit , with a spectral resolution of 20 , only a factor 2 lower than our observed spectra ( see bruzual & charlot 1993 for details ) .",
    "the bc96 models can have different metal abundances and we have used those with metallicities of @xmath107 ( solar ) and @xmath108 ( 0.2 solar ) .",
    "the simplest models are ssp models where there is a single instantaneous burst of star formation at time @xmath109 .",
    "one can also easily generate models where the star formation rate falls exponentially with time .",
    "we have used such models with time constants ranging from 0.2 to 20.0 gyr .",
    "we will refer to these as tau0.2 , etc .",
    "unless otherwise noted , models used have solar metallicity . models with low metal abundance are listed as tau0.6(0040 ) , for example .    because the models produce absolute energy distributions , it is possible to duplicate almost any measurement that is performed on the observational data .",
    "the exception is the measurement of emission line intensities where additional assumptions and calculations , discussed in  [ sec : emeqw ] , are required .",
    "any specific model is characterized by the details of the star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of the time and the age .",
    "a second model parameter is the mean chemical composition .",
    "clearly , there are a large number of possible models , even without varying the chemical composition , and many of them could fit a set of observations for a single galaxy given the measurement uncertainties .",
    "we , therefore , consider only two classes of models . for ssp models",
    "there is only one parameter and that is the age ( in gyr ) after the initial burst of star formation at time @xmath109 . for the tau models there are two parameters , the @xmath110-folding time for decay of the sfr after @xmath109 and the age after @xmath109 . as described in paper ii",
    ", any model can be used to generate the expected @xmath46 ab magnitudes once the redshift is specified .",
    "the most striking characteristic of the models is the change in the slope @xmath54 , defined in  [ sec : img ] , as a function of the age .",
    "for example , figure  [ figff ] shows the slope @xmath54 as a function of the logarithm of the model age in gyr for the ssp model and a series of tau models with different time constants , all computed for a redshift of 0.90 .    over most of the range in @xmath54",
    "the age derived from the absolute energy distribution depends strongly on the choice of model . at large values of @xmath54 ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "the models are very similar and essentially independent of the decay time as long as the decay time constant is less than 0.6 gyr .",
    "we , thus , need to further restrict the range of models that are used .",
    "in one extreme scenario , we could specify that the sfr @xmath110-folding decay time is constant , say 0.6 gyr , for all galaxies .",
    "in this case , all the fitted models lie along one of the curves in figure  [ figff ] .",
    "consequently , the derived ages will vary from 0.1 gyr to many gyr because the observed slopes @xmath54 take on values spanning nearly the total range plotted in figure  [ figff ] .",
    "this was the basis for the modeling done in paper ii .",
    "a somewhat more realistic scenario is to assume that all galaxies ( in a given cluster ) have the same age and the star formation decay rate is variable . in this case , for clusters at @xmath69=0.9 , the fitted models fall along a horizontal line of the appropriate age in figure  [ figff ] .",
    "the derived time constants will range from 0.2 gyr , or less , up to values of 20 gyr corresponding essentially to a constant star formation rate with time .",
    "one should note that there is a region where slope @xmath54 is small and the ages are greater than 0.1 gyr where no tau model will fit .",
    "objects observed in this region must have experienced a recent , large burst of star formation the consequences of which are dominating the observed fluxes .",
    "the fits of the model broadband photometry to the observations are done using the maximum likelihood technique described in paper ii .",
    "for constant age models , the fitting procedure yields a decay rate and a goodness of fit indicator .",
    "furthermore , the age of all galaxies is assumed to be the time elapsed since the universe was 1.05 gyr old ( for @xmath112 , @xmath44 , @xmath113 this corresponds to @xmath114 ) .",
    "the best fit @xmath110-folding times ( in gyr ) are listed in column 9 in tables 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "if an acceptable fit is not possible for @xmath115 gyr , the timescale is simply listed as  long \" . for consistency with paper",
    "ii , where we compared our data only to constant tau models , we also provide ( in column 11 ) the age derived from fitting our broadband bvri data to the @xmath116 family of models ( referred to as the `` color age '' in paper ii ) .",
    "the features in a galaxy s spectrum are age - dependent .",
    "in particular , the metal lines are weak in young hot objects and rapidly strengthen as the stellar population becomes old .",
    "the balmer lines are fairly weak for young hot objects , rapidly increase to a maximum when a - type stars dominate at ages of about 1 gyr , and then rapidly become weak thereafter .",
    "an important diagnostic of the age and metallicity of a galaxy can thus be gleaned from classification of its spectrum .",
    "our spectral classifications are based on the line strengths of various metal and balmer absorption features .",
    "we do not use equivalent widths as a classification parameter because they tend to have large errors .",
    "we do not use emission features in the classification and , thus , differ from the approach used by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who use the widths of the [ oii ] and h@xmath117 lines as their primary discriminants .",
    "we opt to use a _ visual _ spectral classification scheme because the experienced eye can assess the strengths of all the key features simultaneously and , at the same time , judge the level of noise ( including complications such as poor night sky line subtraction ) .",
    "our spectral classes are defined as follows :    * type _ `` a '' _ objects have spectra which are dominated by balmer lines , lack any g - band absorption , and have a caii k line strength which is no more than 25% of the strength of the h + h@xmath118 line ; * type _",

    "the unshaded histograms show the distributions for field galaxies in the range @xmath124 .",
    "the mean slope @xmath54 value shows the expected qualitative correlation with the spectral type increasing from @xmath125 for class _ a _ to @xmath126 for class _ k_. in other words , the older , more metal rich galaxies tend to be , on average , redder .",
    "k _ type galaxies also tend to be significantly brighter ( by 0.7 - 1 mag ) than _ a _ type galaxies , a trend most likely attributed to the dominance of massive elliptical galaxies in the _ k _ spectral class .",

    "the @xmath127 and [ oiii ] regions are also observed for the majority of objects with @xmath128 , but at values of @xmath69 above 0.8 the signal is low and the night - sky emission bands are very strong . in a few low redshift galaxies the @xmath129 region is observed .",

    "the correction is typically 3 to 8 .",
    "we validate our line intensity measurements by comparing line ratios to previously published work .",

    "kennicutt ( 1992 ) has measured these ratios in nearby , mostly late - type galaxies using large apertures and small telescopes .",
    "his better data give ratios of 2.40 and 1.48 , respectively .",
    "these lines have been measured by van zee ( 1998 ) in many hii regions over the whole surfaces of a variety of spiral galaxies . after removing their corrections for reddening ,",

    "although we have measured eight absorption lines in the galaxy spectra , they are not all equally useful . among the metal lines ,",
    "the @xmath141 feature is in a spectral region where any continuum choice is rather arbitrary .",
    "the feature is strong in the redder objects but it is superposed on the balmer h9 line , which will be relevant for bluer galaxies .",
    "the caii h line is superposed on h@xmath118 .",

    "is always suspect since it may be partially or completely filled with emission .",
    "h@xmath117 should be reliable .",
    "h8 is in a crowded spectral region where a continuum is very hard to estimate .",
    "the rest equivalent widths of the @xmath1203835 feature , caii k and the g - band are plotted against the continuum slope @xmath54 in figure  [ figd ] for cluster members . in this figure , and in subsequent similar ones , cluster members in the three clusters , , and  are indicated by open circles , filled circles , and filled squares , respectively .",
    "the errors in the highest s / n equivalent width measurements of the @xmath141 line , the caii k line , h@xmath117 , and the g - band are , respectively , 1.8 , 1.6 , 3.0 , and 2.3 .",
    "the mean equivalent widths as a function of slope @xmath54 for the sub - sample of red and blue galaxies with the best spectra are given in table 8 .    to compare the absorption - line data with the models it is desirable to use models with approximately the same spectral resolution as the observations .",
    "the bc96 model spectra have a resolution or binning size of 20  which is twice as large as the spectral resolution of our observations making direct comparisons with the data difficult .",
    "the 1993 bruzual & charlot ( bc93 ) models , on the other hand , have a resolution of 10  and are , thus , ideal for comparisons with observational data .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of the bruzual & charlot 1993 and 1996 models with the bandpasses optimized for the 1996 models shows that the absorption equivalent widths are larger for the 1996 models by factors that vary from 1.27 to 1.69 depending on the line being measured .",
    "that the factor varies from line to line strongly suggests that the mismatched spectral resolution is indeed at least part of the source of the discrepancy .",
    "further evidence in support of this explanation comes from the excellent agreement between the equivalent widths obtained from a very high s / n spectrum of ngc 4889 in the coma cluster and the bc93 solar metallicity models .",
    "we therefore make comparisons of observed and measured line equivalent widths using the bc93 models .",
    "the line strengths from the bc93 solar metallicity tau0.3 , tau0.6 , and tau1.0 models , all with an age of 4.8 gyr which is close to that expected for cluster galaxies at @xmath142 , are shown in figure  [ figd ] as the solid curves .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the bc93 equivalent widths are in very good agreement with the corresponding values for our distant cluster galaxies .",
    "the conventional 4000  discontinuity measure , d , is not particularly useful for the analysis of young stellar systems ( like those in distant , late - type galaxies ) because it does not enable one to discriminate between spectra that are dominated by metal - line absorption from cool stars and by spectra dominated by the high balmer lines and the balmer jump in a - type stars .",
    "furthermore , the measurement d does not remove the overall color of the object that depends on both the spectral energy distribution and on the wavelength response of the detector ( because our spectra are not flux calibrated ) .",
    "we prefer instead to use the @xmath143 parameter ( first proposed in paper ii ) . for the present analysis , we define two slightly modified jump parameters , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "continuum points are computed by first establishing the mean slope of the spectrum in the rest - frame spectral range 4050 - 4650 , which is usually much better exposed than the region below 3700 .",
    "points near h@xmath117 ( 4075  to 4125 ) and the g - band and h@xmath119 ( 4280  to 4350 ) are excluded from the calculations .",
    "the level of this continuum is normalized to match the mean ab flux in the range 4000 to 4280 .",
    "this normalized continuum level and the measured slope are then used to extrapolate a continuum in the 3750 to 3980  and 3400 to 3700  regions .",
    "figure  [ figjmpdemo ] provides a schematic description of the jump definitions .",
    "the jump @xmath144 is defined as the difference of the average flux ( expressed in ab magnitudes ) measured from 3400 to 3700  and the defined continuum at the central wavelength of this band ( 3550 ) .",
    "the jump @xmath145 is defined as the difference of the average flux ( again in ab magnitudes ) in the range 3750 to 3980  and the defined continuum at the central wavelength of 3865 .",
    "@xmath145 is very similar to the conventional jump d except that the continuum slope has been removed .",
    "it essentially measures the strength of the discontinuity at 4000  caused by metal and late balmer series absorption lines .",
    "@xmath144 measures the balmer jump produced by hydrogen absorption plus any metal - line blanketing in the 3400 to 3700region . since both @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    "depend on an extrapolation of the continuum that is defined above 4000 , they are subject to systematic errors caused by loss of light due to refraction and absolute calibration errors in the blue relative to the red spectral region .",
    "this effect should be small for @xmath145 but can be large for @xmath144 .",
    "subject to these systematic errors , the ratio of @xmath145 to @xmath144 is a measure of the relative importance of the balmer jump and the 4000  break . if the 4000  break is large , both @xmath145 and @xmath144 will be close to unity .",
    "if the balmer jump dominates , @xmath145 will be less than half of @xmath144 .",
    "the measured values of @xmath145 and @xmath144 are given in columns 15 and 16 in tables 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "errors have been estimated in the same manner as those for the equivalent widths .",
    "the typical errors in @xmath145 and @xmath144 are 0.10 mag and 0.13 mag , respectively .    the observed values of @xmath145 and @xmath144 are plotted against the observed slope @xmath54 for members of the three clusters in figure  [ figjujl ] .",
    "representative error bars are shown .",
    "the large open diamonds show the mean jump values in four slope @xmath54 bins for the highest quality spectra only .",
    "these mean values are consistent with the full data distribution , indicating that no serious systematic errors are introduced into the jump estimates at lower signal - to - noise levels .",
    "the solid curve shows the jump values predicted by our constant age scenario models .",
    "the dashed curve shows the predictions from a solar metallicity tau0.6 model .",
    "the small discontinuity in the constant age model predictions at small slope @xmath54 values appears to be caused by some difference in the tau5.0 , tau10.0 , and tau20.0 models or in our interpretation of the models .",
    "the solar metallicity models do a reasonable job of reproducing the observed correlation between @xmath145 and the slope @xmath54 .",
    "there is no significant observed correlation between @xmath144 and the slope @xmath54 .",
    "this is , in part , due to the fact that @xmath144 is affected both by the balmer jump and the 4000  break which tend to evolve in a manner which minimizes the change in @xmath144 .",
    "furthermore , the absolute values of @xmath144 are subject to large systematic errors ( more than @xmath145 ) , and the difference between the observations and models is not significant when these errors are taken into account .      to obtain rough constraints on the metallicities of the galaxies in our survey ,",
    "we must rely on comparisons with the bc96 models as the bc93 models do not include non - solar models . in the following , we therefore use the measured bc96 equivalent widths scaled to correct for the spectral resolution difference between the bc96 models and lris data .",
    "the vectors drawn in figures  [ figd ] and  [ figjujl ] show how the reddest models shift when the metallicity is changed from solar to 0.2 solar .",
    "the shift that is shown is typical when the slope @xmath54 is greater than 6 . at small @xmath54 ,",
    "the shift is smaller because the metal lines have diminished in strength .",
    "the observed caii k and the@xmath1203835 features show excellent consistency with the solar metallicity models .",
    "the g - band measurements would be fitted better with slightly sub - solar metallicity models .",
    "the uncertainties , however , are too large to be definitive .",
    "the j@xmath146 data suggest that a metallicity slightly less than solar would fit the data best .",
    "for j@xmath147 the fits of the models to the observations are all poor .",
    "this may indicate that a substantial amount of the blue light from the galaxy is being lost at the slit .",
    "corrections for reddening will change the slope @xmath54 but not the jumps or equivalent widths .",
    "the horizontal arrows on the representative error bars in the above figures show how the data points would shift if a 0.2 mag de - reddening correction were applied .",
    "a reddening of 0.2 mag in @xmath55 corresponds to a change in slope @xmath54 of 1.7 .",
    "such a reddening correction would not significantly alter the fits to the models . a much larger reddening correction , however , would make the fits of the equivalent widths unacceptable .",
    "the absolute ab magnitudes of the galaxies in the rest b band , @xmath93 , have been calculated as described in  2.2.2 of paper ii and are listed in column 18 of tables 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "figure  [ figr ] shows @xmath93 plotted against the redshift @xmath69 .",

    "one of the striking features of the galaxies in our three samples is the large spread in the color of the cluster members , as measured by the slope @xmath54 .",
    "this is dramatically demonstrated in figure  [ figs ] . as in figure",
    "[ figcc ] , there is almost no sign of the red color ridge that is often seen in clusters at @xmath166 ( oke , gunn , & hoessel 1996 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 , hereafter sed98 ) although there are still quite a number of red galaxies in the samples .",
    "the visibility of the red ridge at @xmath14 is a bit more prominent when a near - infrared color is used , as the cm diagrams of sed98 demonstrate .",
    "all of the objects in the @xmath14 clusters with slope @xmath54 greater than 13 to 14 correspond to the central concentration of red galaxies . in",
    "( @xmath49 ) the galaxies populating the red ridge have @xmath54 greater than 11 .",
    "the broad color distribution of cluster galaxies at @xmath24 is compatible with the evolution predicted from our family of tau models .",
    "this is demonstrated by the curves in figure  [ figs ] which show how the @xmath54 slope of galaxies evolves with redshift .",
    "the nine curves from bottom to top correspond to the bc96 tau20.0 , tau10.0 , tau5.0 , tau2.0 , tau1.5 , tau1.0 , tau0.8 , tau0.6 , and tau0.2 families of models .",
    "specifically , the model spectra are allowed to age by times that are calculated assuming @xmath149 , @xmath167 , and by assuming that star formation commenced 1.05 gyr after the universe began . as can be seen ,",
    "all of the objects at @xmath69=0.9 with values of @xmath54 between 7 and 19 have collapsed into a much narrower range from 11 to 12.5 by @xmath69=0.5 , corresponding to a range in @xmath56 or @xmath57 of 0.1 mag .",
    "the red ridge is , thus , predicted to contain a much larger fraction of the galaxies in a cluster at @xmath166 than at @xmath14 , making the envelope much more prominent at the lower redshifts .",
    "this is clearly what is seen in our the results and those from sed98 .",
    "the bluest objects at @xmath69=0.9 remain very blue by @xmath69=0.5 , however .",
    "the set of models shown in figure  [ figs ] encompass nearly all the galaxies seen at all redshifts .",
    "there are a few objects that are even bluer than our most extreme model .",
    "these are presumably objects where there has been a recent very strong burst of star formation .",
    "in paper ii we demonstrated the strong evolution in the fraction of active galaxies , defined to be those galaxies with [ oii ] rest equivalent widths greater than 15 , in the field and in clusters at @xmath168 relative to what is seen at the present epoch .",
    "we now provide an improved constraint by including the results from and . in total",
    "there are 345 galaxies with redshifts and 25 additional galaxies without redshifts but that have sufficiently high s / n spectra that we can be fairly sure there are no emission lines .",
    "ten objects with low redshifts have strong @xmath127 and [ oiii ] but [ oii ] lies bluewards of the observed spectral range . for field galaxies with @xmath169 ,",
    "65% are active . for field galaxies with @xmath170 ,",
    "the fraction is 79% . for roughly the same range in redshift , hammer ( 1997 )",
    "find quite comparable values of 65% and 90% . within the central 1.5 65 mpc regions of our three distant clusters ,",
    "the fraction of active galaxies is 45% .",
    "this is substantially higher than the 10 to 20% active galaxy component seen in the centers of @xmath171 clusters ( balogh 1997 ) but significantly lower than the active fraction in the surrounding field .",
    "we must examine whether or not our @xmath50band selection criterion biases our estimate of the active galaxy fraction .",
    "the [ oii ] line redshifts into the @xmath37 passband at @xmath172 and redshifts out of the @xmath37 passband at @xmath173 .",
    "hence , one could imagine that selecting targets for spectroscopy based solely on the object s @xmath50band magnitude might potentially bias the sample in favor of objects with strong [ oii ] emission near the survey magnitude limit and , consequently , cause the active fractions to be overestimated .",
    "our selection criterion , however , does not appear to have a significant effect .",
    "we demonstrate this in two ways .",
    "first , the lower plot in figure  [ figo2vsmag ] shows the [ oii ] equivalent width as a function of the galaxy @xmath50band apparent magnitude . there is no preference for galaxies with equivalent widths greater than 15  to lie near the survey magnitude limit .",
    "second , the upper plot in figure  [ figo2vsmag ] shows the @xmath56 color distributions for the 91 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members ( in all three clusters ) and for all 1239 objects without spectroscopic observations that have @xmath37 magnitudes in the _ same _ range as the confirmed cluster galaxies .",
    "a kolmogrov - smirnov test test indicates that these two distributions are only marginally inconsistent - the hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent population is rejected at the 90% confidence level .",
    "this is less than a 2@xmath68 difference .",
    "the source of this small difference is a red tail ( @xmath174 ) in the @xmath56 distribution in the objects without spectra .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figdd ] ( see below ) , there is a rough correlation between [ oii ] equivalent width and galaxy color .",
    "if the objects that were not targeted for spectroscopy were preferentially low [ oii ] emitters , one might expect the distribution of @xmath56 colors in the unmeasured sample to contain a higher fraction of red objects than the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the objects with @xmath174 comprise @xmath175% of all unobserved objects .",
    "however , these reddest objects are distributed relatively uniformly across the imaged areas and are not clustered about the centers of the clusters .",
    "it is thus unlikely that they are all cluster members .",
    "only 10% of the spectroscopically unmeasured objects that lie within 50065 kpc of the cluster centers are redder than @xmath176 .",
    "a conservative limit to the amplitude of any systematic error in our active fraction would thus be about a @xmath177% overestimate .",
    "the actual systematic error is likely to be significantly smaller .",
    "we conclude that our estimates of the active fractions in the field and in the clusters are , thus , not strongly biased by our spectroscopic target selection process .",
    "star formation in galaxies manifests itself in the rest optical bandpass in two important ways .",
    "first , star formation leads to the formation of hii regions which , in turn , generate emission lines and , in particular , the [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , and balmer lines .",
    "second , star formation generates a population of hot stars that make the observed energy distributions of the galaxies blue .",
    "the slope @xmath54 parameter and the emission line equivalent widths are quantitative measures of star formation . specifically , the slope @xmath54 measures the importance of young stars in the spectrum .",
    "the equivalent width is the ratio of the star formation rate during the last few million years to the continuum generated by the main sequence over the total history of the galaxy .",
    "the rest equivalent widths of the [ oii ] line as a function of the overall spectral energy distribution as represented by the slope @xmath54 are displayed in figure  [ figdd ] for spectroscopically confirmed members of the clusters , , and .",
    "qualitatively , the results are as expected : galaxies with strong emission are blue ( small @xmath54 ) while objects with very little emission are red ( large @xmath54 ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath54  [ oii ] ew relationships for the constant age ( 4.8 gyr ) and the tau0.6 models are shown as well for @xmath1 .",
    "for the constant tau models , the sensitivity of the relation to the adopted decay rate of star formation is small , largely because the presence of hot stars and [ oii ] emission are somewhat coupled .",
    "in fact , the curves for tau = 0.2 to tau = 3.0 are almost identical .",
    "the models fit the majority of these observations quite well suggesting that the constant age scenario ( with variable star formation decay rates ) is , on average , a plausible hypothesis .",
    "the constant tau models also provide a good fit .",
    "galaxies which lie to the upper right of the curves are presumably those systems that have undergone a recent burst of star formation .",
    "there is no indication that the relation between [ oii ] ew and the slope @xmath54 in cluster galaxies differs from that in field galaxies .",
    "this is as expected since the relationship is controlled largely by the amount of star formation within a given galaxy and not by larger scale environmental conditions .",
    "we compute model h@xmath131 intensities and rest equivalent widths by assuming case b conditions ( no lyman - line photons escape the nebula but are converted into l@xmath151 or 2-photon plus high level hydrogen line emission ) in the ionized gas and use the ionizing flux indicated by the bc96 models in the 230 to 912  range .",
    "it is assumed that there is no 2-photon emission .",
    "no reddening corrections are made .",
    "detailed calculations of the i([oii])/i ( h@xmath131 ) and i([oiii])/i(h@xmath131 ) ratios have been made for example by mccall , rybski , and shields ( 1985 ) .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1991 ) and olofsson ( 1997 ) have concentrated on the combined ratio ( i([oii ] ) + i([oiii]))/i(h@xmath131 ) .",
    "these show that at near - solar oxygen abundances , the i([oii])/i(h@xmath131 ) and ( i([oii ] ) + i([oiii]))/i(h@xmath131 ) ratios are near a maximum and there is only a small dependence on the oxygen abundance .",
    "a factor 10 in abundance difference only produces a factor 1.6 in the intensity ratio .",
    "our observed average ratios i([oii])/i ( h@xmath131 ) and i([oiii])/i(h@xmath131 ) are best fitted with models with about twice the solar o / h ratio .",
    "the uncertainty in this number is , however , probably at least a factor 2 .",

    "no allowance has been made for foreground reddening .",
    "if the reddening corresponds to @xmath184 then the sfr increases by approximately a factor 2.2 .",
    "the sfr estimates are given in column 17 in tables 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "where possible , the [ oii ] line has been used ; however , in low redshift cases where [ oii ] is not observed , the h@xmath131 and [ oiii ] lines are employed with the [ oiii ] result being given twice the weight of the h@xmath131 result since the former line is on average twice as strong as the latter while the continuum uncertainties are comparable .",
    "the sfr increases slowly with increasing redshift up to @xmath33 and exhibits a dramatic increase with redshift above @xmath33 .",
    "this behavior , shown in figure  [ figsfrvsz ] , is largely a consequence of an increasing _ upper _ envelope to the sfr with increasing redshift coupled with the loss of intrinsically low luminosity galaxies at higher @xmath69 due to the survey flux limit . in order to make a less biased study of the sfr across a large range in redshift and absolute luminosity , it is necessary to normalize the sfr value .",
    "ideally , the best normalization would be to divide the sfr by the galaxy mass .",
    "unfortunately , galaxy mass information is not available for this sample .",
    "the next best normalizing factor would be the absolute k@xmath185band luminosity .",
    "this would work well if the mass - to - light ratio using the k@xmath185 luminosity was nearly constant .",
    "the bruzual and charlot models show that this is approximately the case only for a fairly narrow range of models in age and decay time tau .",
    "kelson ( 1997 ) and van dokkum ( 1998 ) find that the v and i band mass - to - light ratios of the early type cluster galaxies have evolved passively since at least @xmath186 .",
    "k@xmath185 photometry is only available for the subset of our galaxies which lie within the wfpc2 imaging survey region . to derive k@xmath185 photometry for the full sample here",
    ", it would be necessary to make extrapolations of our bvri data to k@xmath185 using the best fit stellar population models .",
    "a preferred approach would be to use our @xmath187 photometry , which is derived ( mostly ) by interpolation and , hence , constrained directly by our observations .",
    "we can then use the bruzual and charlot models and our fits of the observations to these models to determine whether using @xmath188 and a normalized star formation rate defined as    @xmath189    is an acceptable surrogate for a k@xmath185 based normalization .",
    "using our constant age , variable tau model fits , we calculate the value of @xmath190 using model @xmath191 colors for objects in the  field .",
    "we then calculate a normalized star formation rate sfrk@xmath185 as defined in the equation above but with @xmath190 .",
    "a linear @xmath190 versus @xmath188 relation provides a very good fit to the data but the scatter is @xmath192 . the sfrn ",
    "sfrk@xmath185 relation is also linear with a scatter of about @xmath193 .",
    "the rare very blue galaxies with @xmath194 lie significantly beyond this scatter .",
    "had we used constant tau models and allowed the galaxy age to vary , we still would get good linear relations but the scatter would be somewhat larger . for statistical purposes , therefore , it appears that using @xmath188 to normalize the sfr is an adequate alternative to a k@xmath185 based normalization .",
    "we note that the equivalent width of the [ oii ] line is approximately proportional to sfrn : ew[oii ] @xmath51 27.6@xmath195sfrn .",
    "a further question is how nearly the luminosity calculated from the @xmath196 magnitude is proportional to the mass .",
    "again , using the bruzual and charlot models , it is possible to investigate this for the range of models and ages which are relevant . at a given redshift",
    "it is found that it does represent the mass with a scatter of @xmath197 .",
    "it does however change systematically with redshift . between @xmath198 and",
    "@xmath199 @xmath190 brightens by 0.53 mag and is linear with @xmath69 .",
    "this is because in our constant age models the galaxies get younger as redshift increases .",
    "in a constant tau scenario this effect is not present because there is a range of ages at each redshift .    to investigate how the star formation rate , the normalized star formation rate ( sfrn ) , and the [ oii ] line equivalent width change with galaxy luminosity and redshift , we have chosen to generate averages in bins corresponding to approximately 0.1 in @xmath69 and 1 magnitude in luminosity .",
    "the luminosity bins allow for the expected evolution in luminosity with redshift .",
    "the sfrn results are listed in table 10 and all three sfr indicators are plotted in figure  [ figsfrn_vs_abb ] .",
    "there are two general trends : ( 1 ) at a given luminosity , both the [ oii ] ew and the sfrn increase as @xmath69 increases ; ( 2 ) at a given redshift , both the [ oii ] ew and the sfrn decrease as the luminosity increases .",
    "the remarkable aspect of this latter trend is the uniformity of the nearly linear decline in sfrn with increasing abb luminosity for galaxies with @xmath200 .",
    "this result implies that , on average , the sfr is effectively independent of galaxy luminosity over the range @xmath12 .",
    "this is explicitly demonstrated in the upper plot of figure  [ figsfrn_vs_abb ] .",
    "sullivan ( 2000 ) find a similarly weak dependence of [ oii ] equivalent width on galaxy luminosity at @xmath106 .",
    "the increase in sfrn with redshift , at a fixed abb luminosity , is consistent with the predictions of our bc model fits .",
    "naturally , their are important differences between galaxies with different spectral and photometric characteristics .",
    "for example , one expects the sfrn to be dependent on the color of the galaxy , being larger for galaxies which are bluer .",
    "since the equivalent width of [ oii ] is approximately proportional to sfrn , the result is very much like that in figure  [ figdd ] . in the clusters in particular , for slope @xmath201 ,",
    "the average sfrn is 0.20 while for @xmath202 , every object has sfrn @xmath203 .",
    "red objects have very little star formation while in blue objects the star formation rate is high .",
    "one obtains a similar result from the spectral classifications .",
    "the average values of sfrn are 1.56 , 0.79 , 0.61 , and 0.25 , respectively , for spectral classes _  a \" _ , _  a+k\"_,_k+a \" _ , and_k\"_.",
    "cluster formation is believed to involve both a significant amount of infall of the surrounding field galaxies into the cluster s potential as well as environmental processing of the cluster members as they undergo ram pressure stripping , tidal disruption , and merging .",
    "this hypothesis predicts that there should be correlations between the spectral properties of the cluster members and their clustocentric distance .",
    "the amplitude of the correlations tell us something about the fraction of cluster members which have been recently accreted and/or the degree to which environmental processes alter the galaxy characteristics .",
    "figure  [ figsrad ] shows the distribution of galaxy spectral class as a function of the comoving clustocentric distance .",
    "galaxies of spectral class _  k \" _ appear to be somewhat more centrally concentrated than the bluer galaxies of spectral classes _  a \" _ and _  a@xmath204k\"_. the difference , however , is not significant in our current sample . a ks test yields a 42% probability that galaxies with spectral class _  k \" _ are drawn from the same spatial distribution as those with spectral classes _  a \" _ or _ ",
    "a@xmath204k\"_. however , the factor of @xmath205 decline in the fraction of _  k\"_-type galaxies as the clustocentric radius increases from 25065 kpc to 1.565 mpc is significant .",
    "we can also look at the values of the sfr and sfrn as functions of the projected distance of a galaxy from the cluster center .",
    "the data are shown in figure  [ figsfrn ] .",
    "the data for the three clusters are shown on the left side of the figure .",
    "on the right side , for comparison , are the sfr and sfrn values for field galaxies in the redshift range @xmath206 . for comoving clustocentric radii less than 165 mpc ,",
    "a large majority of the cluster objects have low sfrn relative to their field galaxy counterparts . at large distances",
    "there are very few low sfrn objects .",
    "the few high sfrn objects projected near the center of the cluster could be outliers in the distribution , recently infalling galaxies , or foreground and background objects , although their redshifts are consistent with their being cluster members .",
    "a comparison of the cluster galaxies at large distances and field galaxies shows them to be quite similar , although the cluster numbers are quite small .",
    "similar results have been produced for clusters and field galaxies with redshifts from 0.18 to 0.55 by balogh ( 1997 ) , morris ( 1998 ) , balogh ( 1998 ) , and balogh ( 1999 ) .",
    "they find the same suppression of the sfr in clusters relative to the field at the same redshifts .",
    "they suggest that this is caused by ram pressure or tidal stripping of the gas from galaxies as they first fall into the cluster potential or pass near the cluster center .",
    "balogh ( 1998 ) find that even in the outer regions of the clusters the sfr is less than in the field whereas our data suggest that they are much the same .",
    "this may be an evolutionary effect in which the process of suppression of the sfr in clusters has proceeded further at @xmath166 than at the much earlier time corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "larger surveys , sampling systems with a broad range in icm properties , are needed to fully understand the nature of the observed trends .",
    "extensive data from a joint hst / keck imaging and spectroscopic survey of 9 distant clusters has provided a wealth of observational constraints on galaxy and cluster evolution . in this paper , we have focused on the properties of the galaxies in and around the 3 most massive clusters in our survey :  ( @xmath38 ) ,  ( @xmath39 ) , and  ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "our most important results are summarized below .    *",
    "the central velocity dispersions of the clusters are accurately measured from the redshifts of @xmath20720 to 40 member galaxies .",
    "the dispersions lie in the range 900  1300 and the resulting kinematic mass estimates are @xmath20865 m@xmath5 ( see table 5 and figure  [ figvdisp ] ) .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosities of these clusters are : log@xmath209 for , log@xmath210 for , and log@xmath211 for ( the uncertainties in the logarithm of the bolometric luminosity are about @xmath212 ) .",
    "these values are low for the derived velocity dispersions of these clusters .",
    "for example , the low-@xmath69 @xmath213 relation ( donahue 1998 ) would predict our clusters should have kinetic icm temperatures in the range 5  10 kev , suggesting bolometric x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath214 erg s@xmath42 ( based on the @xmath215 relation from mushotsky & scharf 1997 ) . specifically , the predicted bolometric luminosities based on the mushotsky & scharf results and then @xmath216 as the independent variable . ] are log@xmath217 = 45.0 , 45.4 , and 44.7 for , , and , respectively  about an order of magnitude larger than what is actually observed ( the factor can lie in the range 3 to 60 , depending on the cluster , due to the error in the observed quantity ) . however , this is not uncommon in optically selected clusters at @xmath168 ( see holden 1997 ) .",
    "possible explanations for this may include an enhanced population of optically rich , x - ray faint clusters at @xmath218 , more efficient detection of galaxy - rich clusters in which the dynamical state of the icm is still evolving when selecting clusters in optical passbands , and a higher fraction of clusters at @xmath105 in which the infall of field galaxies is still a significant process . *",
    "the cluster m / l ratios are consistent with those derived for their low-@xmath69 counterparts , lying comfortably between 100  500 ( see table 6 ) .",
    "the systematic errors associated with determining these ratios prevent any conclusive statements about evolution of the m / l ratios",
    ". however , large m / l ( @xmath219 ) ratios , expected if @xmath220 on cluster scales , are strongly ( @xmath221% c.l . ) rejected . * the rest - frame b - band characteristic magnitude of the integrated field galaxy luminosity function evolves with redshift roughly as @xmath222 where @xmath103 ( see table 7 and figures  [ figlffit ] and  [ figlfevol ] ) . caution is recommended in the interpretation of this observation as we do not have a sufficient number of objects to subdivide our analysis by galaxy color or spectral class .",
    "it is well known that the local lf is a strong function of color ( blanton 2001 ) and evolution of the lf has already been shown to be color dependent ( lilly 1995 ) .",
    "we note , however , the our observations of the brightest cluster galaxies show that their rest - frame b - band luminosity evolves with redshift in a very similar fashion .",
    "the tau0.2 model predicts an increase in bcg luminosity which is nearly identical to the simple lf evolution with @xmath223 ; the tau1.0 model for bcg evolution is nearly identical to the @xmath224 scenario",
    ". the observed evolution of the absolute bcg magnitudes is best fit by solar metallicity models with @xmath225 .",
    "our data also suggest that the @xmath100 in clusters has dimmed by about 0.7 mag between @xmath105 and the current epoch .",
    "* the mean spectral characteristics of the cluster galaxies , such as the metal - line equivalent widths , @xmath145 jump parameter , and derived ( normalized ) star formation rates , are well correlated with their broadband photometric properties , such as the slope @xmath54 value ( see table 8 and figures  [ figsptypevsb ] ,  [ figd ] ,  [ figjujl ] , and  [ figdd ] ) .",
    "these correlations are a straight forward consequence of the star formation process ",
    "galaxies with active star forming regions have spectra with oxygen line emission and balmer absorption .",
    "these same galaxies have blue seds as a consequence of their young stellar population .",
    "similarly , the light from older galaxies , which typically have strong metal - line absorption features , is dominated by a red stellar population .",
    "these correlations are also observed in field galaxies . *",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric properties of the cluster galaxies are well fit by the bruzual - charlot solar metallicity , constant - age ( 4.8 gyr at @xmath14 ) , variable tau models .",
    "models with sub - solar metallicity are not strongly rejected so long as long as the metallicity is at least 0.2 of solar . a significant amount of dust extinction at @xmath142",
    "is not likely  the observations can be fit acceptably by the solar metallicity models so long as e@xmath226 mag . *",
    "all the clusters host a significant early - type galaxy population , although an envelope of red elliptical - like galaxies , so prominent in many @xmath227 clusters , is only weakly detected at these redshifts ( see figures  [ figcc ] and  [ figs ] ) . indeed , many of the spectroscopically confirmed cluster members are blue ( slope @xmath228 , @xmath229 ) and some remarkably so ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "these observations are consistent with the predictions from coeval tau models : the intrinsic scatter in the logarithmic slope of the ( optical ) spectral energy distributions of the redder cluster members is expected to decrease by a factor @xmath231 between @xmath14 and @xmath166 and by a further factor of @xmath231 between @xmath166 and the current epoch .",
    "we note that the contrast of the red elliptical sequence is enhanced significantly if a nir passband is combined with an optical passband in the definition of the cm diagram ( gladders & yee 2000 ) .",
    "* the average i([oii])/i(h@xmath131 ) ratio is very similar to that found in nearby galaxies while the average i([oiii])/i(h@xmath131 ) is somewhat higher .",
    "these ratios are best fit by models with a metallicity of twice solar , although the uncertainty is at least a factor 2 . * a star formation rate , sfrn , normalized to the galaxy s luminosity at the rest @xmath15 wavelength ,",
    "is found to increase as the redshift increases and decrease as the luminosity increases ( see table 10 and figure  [ figsfrn_vs_abb ] ) .",
    "in addition , models show that , on average , the sfrn is predicted to be roughly proportional to the sfr per unit mass our sample of galaxies .",
    "the sfr and sfrn are correlated with galaxy color and spectral classification - redder galaxies exhibit , on average , weaker star formation activity and stronger metal line absorption .",
    "one remarkable aspect of these results is the uniformity of the decline of sfrn with luminosity over a large range of abb magnitude and redshift .",
    "this implies that the average sfr per galaxy in this sample is nearly independent of galaxy redshift and luminosity in the ranges @xmath232 and @xmath12 . * for field galaxies with @xmath169",
    ", 65% are active ( [ oii ] equivalent width greater than 15 ) . for field galaxies with @xmath170 ,",
    "the fraction is 79% . within the central 1.5 65 mpc regions of our three distant clusters ,",
    "the fraction of active galaxies is 45% .",
    "this is substantially higher than the 10 to 20% active galaxy component seen in the centers of @xmath171 clusters but is lower than that seen in the field at redshifts comparable with those of our distant clusters . within the central comoving cluster distance of 1.065 mpc a large fraction of the cluster galaxies",
    "have low values of sfrn ( relative to field galaxies at similar redshifts ) and have spectra which exhibit strong caii k , @xmath1203835 and g - band absorption but exhibit little or no h@xmath119 absorption . above 1.065 mpc ,",
    "on the other hand , the average sfrn in cluster galaxies is nearly as high as that in field galaxies in the same redshift range .",
    "the smooth melding of the star forming properties of galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters with that in galaxies in the general field ( see figure  [ figsfrn ] ) coupled with the lower overall fraction of active galaxies in the cluster cores can be understood if a ) the accretion of field galaxies by the clusters is a significant process at these intermediate redshifts and/or b ) if the volume containing the majority of gas - poor cluster members ( due to environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping ) evolves with time . in the latter case , we would conclude that at @xmath105 the effects of cluster induced gas stripping have been largely confined to the central 165 mpc region whereas at @xmath29 the effects of these processes encompass a significantly larger volume about the cluster center ( balogh 1998 ) .",
    "* we detect a factor of @xmath205 decline in the fraction of _",
    " k\"_-type galaxies as the clustocentric radius increases from 25065 kpc to 1.565 mpc ( see figure  [ figsrad ] ) .",
    "this is further evidence in support of the importance of environmental effects in cluster cores on star formation activity in galaxies .",

    "<S> new photometric and spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the directions of three distant clusters are presented as part of our on - going high - redshift cluster survey . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters are cl1324 + 3011 at @xmath0 , cl1604 + 4304 at @xmath1 , and cl1604 + 4321 at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have spectroscopically confirmed cluster membership for 20 to 40 galaxies in each system and have also obtained spectra for over 280 field galaxies spanning the range @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> kinematic estimates of the mass within the central 77065 kpc of each cluster are in excess of @xmath4 65 m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed x - ray luminosities in these clusters are at least a factor of 3 smaller than those observed in clusters with similar velocity dispersions at @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> these clusters contain a significant population of elliptical - like galaxies , although these galaxies are not nearly as dominant as in massive clusters at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a large population of blue cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> defining an active galaxy as one in which the rest equivalent width of [ oii ] is greater than 15 , the fraction of active cluster galaxies , within the central 1.0 65 mpc , is 45% . in the field population </S>",
    "<S> , we find that 65% of the galaxies with redshifts between @xmath8 and @xmath9 are active , while the fraction is 79% for field galaxies at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rate normalized by the rest ab @xmath11band magnitude , sfrn , increases as the redshift increases at a given evolving luminosity . at a given redshift </S>",
    "<S> , however , sfrn decreases linearly with increasing luminosity indicating a remarkable insensitivity of the star formation rate to the intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy over the range @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> cluster galaxies in the central 165 mpc regions exhibit depressed star formation rates and contain a larger fraction of galaxies with _  k \" _ type spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rates in galaxies lying between @xmath1365 mpc from the cluster centers , however , are in good agreement with that in galaxies in the general field at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic and photometric properties of the cluster galaxies are well fit by bruzual - charlot solar metallicity , constant - age ( 4.8 gyr at @xmath14 ) , variable tau models . </S>",
    "<S> metallicities in these clusters must be at least 0.2 of solar , and a significant amount of dust extinction is unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> we are able to measure significant evolution in the @xmath15-band luminosity function over the range @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic luminosity increases by a factor of 3 with increasing redshift over this range . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with an analysis of the luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies in these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the bcgs are typically twice as luminous as their current epoch counterparts .    </S>",
