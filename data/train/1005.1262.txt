    "since their first observation in solid state superconductors @xcite and liquid @xmath0he @xcite arrays of quantized vortices have been one of the key features of systems exhibiting frictionless flow .",
    "more recently the observation of vortex lattices in gaseous bose - einstein condensates @xcite has led to an re - newed interest in these systems , as ultracold atomic gases are highly configurable systems and allow for investigation of the lattices under a wide range of external parameters . since",
    "then a large number of theoretical and experimental studies have been undertaken , which , for example , have examined the equilibrium properties of vortex lattices in different external potentials @xcite or the dynamical properties of vortices lattices when disturbed @xcite . at the same time new ideas for applications in quantum information @xcite and precision measurement @xcite have been developed .",
    "the geometry of a vortex lattice is determined by the condition to minimize the energy of the overall system under the provision of fixed angular momentum .",
    "it therefore depends on the interaction energy between the velocity fields of the vortices , which is a logarithmic function of the distance between , and the underlying external potential . for bose - einstein condensates carrying large angular momentum in isotropic harmonic traps",
    "this leads to the formation of a triangular abrikosov lattices of vortices with winding number one  @xcite . for trap geometries that are not simply connected , such as a toroidal shapes",
    ", the system can also responds by forming persistent currents with higher winding numbers @xcite .",
    "other trap geometries and parameters , such as anisotropic traps @xcite or optical lattices @xcite , no longer support an abrikosov lattice , but instead form zigzag or linear , and square lattices respectively .",
    "while vortices and vortex lattices are interesting to study on their own merits @xcite , it has been suggested that they can be used in quantum information applications through encoding of information into the winding number @xcite .",
    "these numbers are so - called geometrical quantum numbers , which have the advantage of not suffering from any energetic instabilities and which are stable as long as the vortex cores are part of the system . transferring the atoms into superposition states of these quantum numbers",
    "can be done either by optical methods @xcite , or by making use of anisotropic external potentials @xcite . however , due to the very dense energy spectrum of atomic superfluid systems it is a very difficult task to separate out exactly two flow states @xcite . since the vortex - vortex interaction is dependent on both magnitude and direction of rotation , however , one can in principle imagine a setup for a superfluid quantum computer analogous to the linear ion - trap model of cirac and zoller @xcite . in order to facilitate control and addressing of the individual vortex qubits",
    "it therefore would be preferable to reduce the number of nearest neighbours from six in the abrikosov lattice , to , say , two in a linear crystal .",
    "it is known by today that two systems with which this can be achieved are waveguides @xcite and anisotropic traps @xcite .",
    "here we consider the latter systems at medium rotation and with a small numbers of vortices . for currently typical experimental non - linearities it was recently found that even relatively small anisotropies , @xmath1 , lead to the vortices forming a linear crystals with equal spacing between them @xcite .",
    "however , the inhomogeneity of the background gas leads to a finite velocity of the vortex lattice within the cloud @xcite , which in the limit of large vorticity cancels out the external rotation @xcite . for systems of medium vorticity in an anisotropic trap it is obvious that the linear shape of the crystal can not be maintained during these dynamics and we will show here that this results in excitations within the background cloud which can be described by a standard hydrodynamics approach @xcite . more surprisingly , we also find that the excitations are oscillatory and do not destroy the ordering of the vortex lattice , even in the situation when the external rotation is switched off .    in the following",
    "we will first briefly introduce our model and then examine the dynamics of the linear vortex lattices as a function of anisotropy by integrating the underlying gross - pitaevskii equation for time scales of several hundred milliseconds .",
    "we determine the characteristic excitation frequencies of the vortex lattice and compare them to the known frequencies for anisotropic condensates . finally , we remark on the stability of the vortices themselves .",
    "to simulate the dynamics of the vortices we consider a two - dimensional model of bose condensed gas of particles of mass @xmath2 in a harmonic trap , @xmath3 , where the anisotropy is determined by the aspect ratio , @xmath4 .",
    "the trap is rotating around the @xmath5-axis and we assume that a strong potential suppresses all relevant dynamics in this direction . for small , but non - negligible anisotropies ( @xmath6 for typical experimental systems ) , the ground state for medium rotation frequencies is given by a single line of vortices along the weak axis of the trap @xcite . in the case of an odd number of vortices , one vortex will be located at the centre of the trap and the others will be symmetrically arranged around it . for an even number the same symmetry exists , however without the central vortex . furthermore the vortex spacing remains roughly even along the soft axis due to the slow variation of the condensate density .    for large rotational frequencies the condensate s efforts to distribute the vorticity as uniformly as possible lead to a self - consistent solid body rotation which cancels out the overall rotations of the lattice in the co - rotating frame .",
    "@xcite . in the region of medium vorticity ,",
    "however , in which only a few vortices are present , the concept of a diffused vorticity can not be applied and the vortex lattice will try to carry out rotation in the co - moving frame .",
    "it is not surprising that in anisotropic traps this will lead to a dynamics that will have a feedback onto the density distribution of the atomic cloud .    in the following",
    "we will consider these dynamics as a function of the trap anisotropy for the case of @xmath7rb and currently realistic trapping frequencies .",
    "all our simulations are done by numerically integrating the gross - pitaevskii equation using a fft / split - operator method .",
    "the hamiltonian for a bose - einstein condensate in an anisotropic trap and under rotation is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of atoms and @xmath10 is the frequency with which the trap rotates around the @xmath5-axis . as usual , for stability reasons @xmath10 is restricted to values smaller than the trapping frequency of the soft axis of the condensate .",
    "the two dimensional interaction strength is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 nm being the three dimensional scattering length for @xmath7rb in the @xmath13 state .",
    "we are interested in studying the behaviour of a ground state lattice as a function of time .",
    "while the behaviour of the condensate as a whole can be studied using a hydrodynamics approach in the thomas - fermi limit @xcite , the dynamics of the vortices themselves require an approach that is able to resolve the dynamics on the length scale of the healing length , such as the gross - pitaevskii equation . to have a clean initial state we therefore first find the ground state of the hamiltonian   by a numerical relaxation method and",
    "then integrate this state in time while maintaining the rotation .",

    "the centre vortex can be seen to remain stationary , while the other four vortices periodically oscillate away from their initial position .",
    "the dashed lines in the density plot indicate the range of movement in the @xmath17-direction for each of the vortices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2p5y ] ) . ]    the results of the numerical integration for a crystal of five vortices in a trap of aspect ratio @xmath18 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2p5x ] .",
    "the upper half shows the starting configuration and the lower half displays the positions of the individual vortices as a function of time along the soft direction of the trap . the detailed displacement in the tight direction of the trap is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2p5y ] and its range is indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2p5x ] .",
    "there are four immediate observations one can make from looking at these results : ( i ) the trajectories in both directions are symmetric for the pairs of vortices that are at equal distance from the centre of the trap .",
    "the central vortex remains stationary at all times ; ( ii ) while the oscillation amplitudes for the two inner and the two out vortices are different , they are in phase with each other during the whole evolution ; ( iii ) the vortex motion is periodic and in particular the direction of rotation of the lattice reverses regularly and ( iv ) the paths of the vortices never cross and the linear ordering is maintained at all times .",
    "closer examination shows that the trajectories of the two vortices on the right hand side and the two vortices on the left hand side follow the exact same pattern and are only different by a constant factor in their amplitude .",
    "this applies to the motion in the @xmath16 as well as in the @xmath17 direction and shows that the distance between neighbouring pairs of vortices is the same at any point in time .",
    "we have calculated these dynamics for different aspect ratios and found the behaviour consistently . as an example fig .",

    "all system parameters are the same as in the @xmath20 case and all observations made apply here as well with reduced amplitude . in the @xmath17-direction",
    "the movement is on the order of @xmath21 m ( not shown ) . ]    to better understand this pattern , we show in table [ tab : comparison ] the dominating oscillation frequencies for the vortex oscillations in three different traps .",
    "for all anisotropies we find two dominating frequencies , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and in the soft direction the lower frequency has a larger amplitude whereas in the tight direction the opposite is true . for increasing anisotropy the lower frequency decreases , whereas the higher frequency increases .",
    "this can clearly not be explained by straightforward oscillations in the harmonic potential , but indicates that the non - linearity of the sample plays a significant role .",
    "at the same time , it is also clear that the oscillation does not originate from a simply stationary vortex crystal inside an oscillating background cloud , as the cloud would be stationary in the co - rotating frame .",
    "however , we will show in the following that both factors are playing an important role .",
    ".[tab : comparison ] frequencies dominating the oscillation of the vortex lattice from the numerical integration of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and oscillation frequencies from the hydrodynamic model for the background cloud ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) for different values of the anisotropy . for comparison the trapping frequencies",
    "are shown as well . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us describe the dynamics of the background cloud using a hydrodynamic formalism and assume that the excitation of it are triggered and driven by the motion of the vortices .",
    "in fact , we assume that the rotation of the vortices leads to an infinitesimal rotation of the whole cloud and solve the classical hydrodynamical equations from there .",
    "this scenario was recently investigated by lobo and castin in order to find the scissors mode of a rotating condensate with vortices @xcite .",
    "the density profile , @xmath26 , and the velocity field , @xmath27 , of a condensate in a rotating anisotropic trap in the thomas - fermi limit in the co - rotating frame can be described by the equations of classical hydrodynamics as @xmath28 because we have chosen the ground state with a stationary linear vortex lattice as the initial condition for the cloud , the condensate is characterised by @xmath29 for the velocity field and by the thomas - fermi solution for the density @xmath30\\;.\\ ] ] we assume that the rotation of the vortex lattice , and therefore the change in the associated flow , leads to a small , initial disturbance that corresponds to a rotation of the whole system with respect to the trap .",
    "it can be described by a small angle , @xmath31 , from which the initial conditions for the linear perturbations to the above equations are given as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the subsequent dynamical evolution can then be calculated using the time - dependent polynomial ansatz @xmath34\\\\    \\delta\\bf{v}&=\\delta b(t)\\bf{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a symmetric and @xmath36 is a general @xmath37 matrix and the chemical potential enters via the evolution of the number @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of these equations shows an oscillation pattern which again is dominated by two main frequencies , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and which we have tabulated in table [ tab : comparison ] .    while these are not , and were not expected to be , a perfect match for the lattice oscillation frequencies , they are closer in value and in particular show the same trend of increase and decrease .",
    "this shows that the oscillations of the lattice excite and drive oscillations within the background cloud , which in turn feeds back onto the lattice dynamics to create the continuous and periodic behaviour .",
    "this is also demonstrated in the fact that that the amplitude of the lattice oscillations is significantly larger than the amplitudes of the cloud . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillations ] we show that the oscillation angle of the lattice cloud is clearly much larger than the one for the background cloud , which in fact stays very close to its initial distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the whole dynamics is highly predictable and in particular the order of the vortices is maintained throughout .     [ upper panel ] and @xmath39 [ lower panel ] .",
    "the full white line indicates the tilted axis of the vortex crystal and the broken white line the horizontal starting position .",
    "the oscillation of amplitude of the background cloud is too small to be visible in this plot . ]",
    "it is interesting to investigate the robustness of the order of the vortex lattice under even stronger perturbations of the background cloud and we will therefore in the following investigate the dynamics of the cloud in the absence of external rotation . from the results above",
    "it should be clear that the background flow will be strongly disturbed by the now non - rotating trapping potential and one might expect the linear vortex crystal to break up into a random pattern .",
    "as the system is finite , it is clear , though , that after some evolution the linear form has to be re - assumed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonrot ] we show an example of the time evolution of a cloud with initially five vortices aligned along the soft axis ( a ) and an aspect ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "the vortex crystal can be seen to rotate against the cloud , still maintaining its linear shape after @xmath40 s ( b ) . after a further @xmath41 s the linear geometry",
    "is slightly disturbed when the vortices are passing through the narrow direction of the condensate ( c ) , but they finally assume the linear shape again after about @xmath42 s ( d ) .",
    "as for the case of maintained trap rotation , the outer most pair of vortices follows a symmetrical path , as do the inner pair of vortices .",
    "however once the narrow section is passed the pairs on each side have changed their order for the first time(see fig .",
    "[ fig : l_2_5_norot ] ) and this process will be repeated over and over again during the ensuing evolution .",
    "the vortices also regularly form a linear crystal again ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : l_2_5_norot](d ) ) , however not necessarily along the horizontal axis .",
    "this behaviour persists for higher ratios of the anisotropy , until the condensate itself decays too fast , due to the anisotropic barrier it runs into , to be able to define a clear vortex crystal .",
    "for which the rotation has been switched off .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the initial linear crystal at @xmath43 s and the subsequent panels show the times @xmath40 s ( b ) , @xmath44 s ( c ) and @xmath45 s ( d ) .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the disturbed crystal as outer vortices pass the narrow direction of the condensate as they rotate around the central vortex and panel ( d ) shows the reformation of the linear crystal . at this time",
    "the left and right pairs of vortices have rotated around the central vortex , and the inner and outer vortices on each side have swapped position .",
    "the phase plots show that the charge of the vortices is maintained throughout the time evolution . ]",
    "-direction for @xmath46 and for @xmath14 .",
    "the values for the initially outer pair of vortices are given by the full line and the inner pair of vortices by the broken .",
    "it can be seen that the paths remain symmetrical for the respective pairs , however they switch positions periodically . ]",
    "let us finally briefly comment on the stability of vortices in the lattice . as the systems we investigate are not rotationally symmetric , they do not need to conserve angular momentum and it is possible for the vortices to reverse their direction of flow @xcite .",
    "however , this tunneling between different rotational states is suppressed at larger interaction strengths and as all our simulations are carried out in the thomas - fermi limit , we have checked that all vortices keep their initial rotational direction throughout the simulations . to demonstrate this for one example",
    ", we show the phase distributions for the case of the non - rotating cloud in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_2_5_norot ] .",
    "we have numerically investigated the dynamics of a linear vortex lattice in an anisotropic , two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate .",
    "starting from the ground state of the gross - pitaevskii equation , we have found that the vortices retain an ordered structure both in the presence and absence of rotation for time - scales on the order of 1 s. if the rotation of the cloud is maintained , the vortex lattice remains linear and only carries out well defined oscillations within the background cloud . with increased anisotropy oscillation amplitude decreases until finally the crystal does not move within the cloud .",
    "this allows for the use of the vortex lattices in applications such as , for example , in quantum information . in the absence of rotation we found that the outer vortices circle around the central vortex , periodically reversing their order and the lattice and linear crystals",
    "are periodically reformed for not too large anisotropies .",
    "once these get too strong , the background cloud gets too distorted to still talk about a well defined vortex lattice ."
