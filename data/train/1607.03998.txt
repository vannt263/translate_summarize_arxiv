    "spectral measure_. the precise meaning of the `` rough initial conditions / data '' are specified as follows .",

    "the rough initial data refers to any signed borel measure @xmath21 such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "it is easy to see that condition is equivalent to the condition that the solution to the homogeneous equation ",
    "@xmath27 defined in below  exists for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the comparison principle refers to the property that if two initial conditions are comparable , then the corresponding solutions to the stochastic partial differential equations are also comparable . for any borel measure @xmath21 on @xmath30 , `` @xmath31 '' has its obvious meaning that @xmath21 is a nonnegative measure and `` @xmath32 '' refers to the fact that @xmath31 and @xmath21 is nonvanishing , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 be two solutions starting from two measures @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we say that satisfies the _ weak comparison principle _ if @xmath38 a.s . for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 whenever @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , we say that satisfies the _ strong comparison principle _ if @xmath40 for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 a.s .",
    "whenever @xmath41 .",
    "note that when @xmath16 , it is relatively easier to establish the weak comparison principle since the solution can be approximated by its regularized version , which admits a feynman - kac formula ; see @xcite .",
    "most strong comparison principles are obtained through mueller s original work @xcite , where he proved the case when @xmath42 , @xmath2 is the space - time white noise , @xmath43 ( for all @xmath44 ) , and the initial data is a bounded function . in @xcite , shiga studied the same equation as that in @xcite except that @xmath3 is assumed to be lipschitz and there can be a drift term . by using concentration of measure arguments for",
    "discrete directed polymers in gaussian environments , flores established in @xcite the strict positivity of solution to 1-d pam with dirac delta initial data .",
    "following arguments by mueller and shiga , chen and kim extended these results in @xcite to allow both fractional laplace operators and rough initial data .",
    "recently , by using paracontrolled distributions , gubinelli and perkowski gave an intrinsic proof of the strict positivity ; see @xcite .",
    "their proof does not depend on the details of noise , though they require the initial data to be a function that is strict positive anywhere .",
    "when @xmath45 , in order to study a random field solution , the noise has to have some color in space .",
    "equation has been much studied since the introduction by dawson and salehi @xcite as a model for the growth of a population in a random environment . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that if the initial condition is a bounded function , and under some integrability condition on @xmath6 , now called _",
    "dalang s _ condition , i.e. , @xmath46 there is a unique random field solution to equation .",
    "this equation has been extensively studied ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "recently , chen and kim showed that dalang s condition also guarantees an @xmath47-continuous random field solution starting from rough initial conditions ; see @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "comparison principle in this setting is much less known , though people believe that it is true . in @xcite , tessitore and zabczyk proved the strict positivity for the case when @xmath6 belongs to @xmath48 for some @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , this condition excludes the important riesz kernel case , i.e. , @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , we will show that under dalang s condition , if @xmath52 , then the solution @xmath9 starting from any nonnegative rough initial data is a.s .",
    "nonnegative for any @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , if the nonnegative rough initial data is nonvanishing and @xmath19 satisfies @xmath53$,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we are able to establish the strict positivity of @xmath9 through the following small - ball probability estimate : @xmath54 similar small - ball probabilities in various settings can be found in @xcite .",
    "these nonnegativity statements can be translated into comparison statements by considering @xmath55 .",
    "condition is natural since in a recent paper @xcite , it is shown that dalang s condition alone can not guarantee the existence of a continuous version of the solution",
    ". there might be solutions that behave so badly that they may hit zero .",
    "whether this phenomenon does happen is still not clear to us and it is left for future exploration . for the moment , we are content with this slightly strong condition .",
    "indeed , if the initial condition is a bounded function , sanz - sol and sarr @xcite showed that condition guarantees that the solution is a.s .",
    "hlder continuous with order @xmath12 in space and @xmath13 in time for any small @xmath14 . in this paper",
    ", we have extended this result for rough initial conditions .",
    "the space - time white noise case is proved in @xcite .    in all these studies ,",
    "the moment bounds / formulas play an important role .",
    "the upper bounds for the second moments under dalang s condition for rough initial conditions is obtained in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we extend this bound to obtain similar upper bounds for all @xmath56-th moments , @xmath10 . using these moments upper bounds",
    ", we establish the ( weak ) comparison principle , whose property is assumed in @xcite in order to obtain some nontrivial lower bounds for the second moments .",
    "note when @xmath16 , the @xmath56-th moment admits a feynman - kac representation , which has been exploited to study the intermittency phenomenon in @xcite .",
    "the solution to is understood as the mild form @xmath57 where @xmath27 is the solution to the homogeneous equation @xmath58 and @xmath59    we will prove seven theorems listed as follows :    [ t : wcomp ] assume that @xmath19 satisfies dalang s condition .",

    "continuous , then @xmath64    if @xmath52 , then @xmath65 is the unique solution to starting from @xmath66 .",
