    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are bright flashes of radiation with a spectral energy peaking in the @xmath0-ray band ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "their duration ranges from fractions of a second to a few minutes and produce directed fluxes of relativistic material with kinetic luminosities exceeding @xmath1 . in order to produce such high luminosities , and observed milli - second variability in flux , it is common and reasonable to invoke the presence of a compact object ( such as a neutron star , ns , or a black hole , bh ) as part of the grb production mechanism at the level of the central engine . to date , despite the lack of definitive direct evidence , it is generally thought that grbs are the result of cataclysmic events involving nss ( perhaps magnetized ) or bhs and violent , so - called hypercritical accretion which produces a violent episode of energy release that is subsequently transformed into electromagnetic radiation ( see piran 2004 ; nakar 2007 ; lee & ramirez - ruiz 2007 ; gehrels et al .",
    "2009 for comprehensive reviews ) .    from grb afterglow observations that cover the range from x - rays to radio , it was possible to locate the origin of this sources at cosmological distances ( see van paradijs et al .",
    "2000 for an initial review ) .",
    "short grbs are typically located at @xmath2 1 meanwhile , long grbs are located at @xmath3 or more , and compete with quasars for the most distant objects observed . on the whole , the hosts of sgrbs , and by extension the progenitors , are not drawn from the same parent population of long grbs .",
    "sgrbs appear to be more diffusely positioned around galaxies , and their associated hosts contain a generally older population of stars ( lee & ramirez - ruiz 2007 , berger 2011 ) .",
    "observations also show that long grbs can sometimes be associated with a sn ( with no h lines , i.e. type ib or ic ) taking place at the same time and at the same place .",
    "the observation of grb980425 in conjunction with one of the most unusual sne ever seen ( sn1998bw , galama et al .",
    "1998b ) was the first of this kind , but not the last .",
    "further , the host properties , and the locations of the bursts within them , provide strong evidence that they are related to vigorous star formation , strengthening the link with the death of massive stars ( fruchter et al .",
    "2006 , levesque 2013 ) .",
    "the review by woosley & bloom ( 2006 ) shows the existing evidence for the link of long grb at low redshift with type ic sne , and the progenitor mechanisms currently explored .",
    "woosley ( 1993 ) proposed the collapsar model to explain the formation of a grb , from a pre - supernova star in which the shutdown of nuclear reactions in the core leads to collapse and the formation of a black hole , rather than a neutron star .",
    "the accretion of the infalling material would form an accretion disk , releasing energy to power the burst .",
    "two main variants on this model may occur .",
    "in the first , the fe core is massive enough to induce a direct collapse of the core into a bh , while in the second an intermediate stage produces a proto - neutron star first , which later collapses after enough matter has been accreted onto its surface ( typically this would take a few seconds ) .",
    "two key ingredients , presumably associated to the progenitor , make this a relatively rare occurrence ( as they must , considering that the rate of core - collapse sne far exceeds the observed grb rate ) : rotation , and the lack of a hydrogen envelope .",
    "the first is necessary in order to ensure that a large fraction of the available energy is released in a disk close to the black hole through accretion , rather than simply be swallowed whole by the bh ( in something akin to bondi accretion ) .",
    "evolutionary models for rapidly rotating stars ( woosley & heger 2006 ) show that the core is able to retain enough angular momentum to make this a possibility depending on the mass loss history and the presence ( or lack ) of magnetic fields coupling the envelope to the inner regions .",
    "the second is required in order for the relativistic jet that is launched at the center of the star to perforate it , break out , and eventually lead to high energy emission far from the stellar surface , which we observe as a grb .",
    "the envelope may either have been lost through interaction with a binary companion , or , if efficient mixing occurs throughout the star , the giant phase may be avoided altogether keeping the radius relatively small ( yoon & langer 2005 , woosley & heger 2006 ) . once a centrifugally supported disk forms",
    ", the temperature will be high enough that neutrino emission becomes the main cooling mechanism , as pointed out in the context of supernovae by chevalier ( 1989 ) and houck & chevalier ( 1991 ) , allowing accretion to proceed at extremely high rates with the attending energy release . in principle",
    "the burst itself may be powered by a combination of neutrinos themselves , or magnetic mechanisms that tap the rotation in the disk and/or the black hole .",
    "macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) carried out a the first detailed numerical study of the collapsar , and further explored jet production , propagation and breakout from the star for a variety of configurations ( macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 , zhang , woosley & macfadyen 2003 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the explosion eventually does launch the stellar envelope outward and produces an extremely energetic event , leading to the observed hypernovae .",
    "an important point is that the amount of angular momentum in the star is crucial for grb production ( lee & ramirez - ruiz 2006 ) .",
    "too much of it results in an accretion disk that forms far from the black hole .",
    "the temperatures and densities are then not high enough for efficient cooling through neutrinos , and hypercritical accretion can not proceed .",
    "too little of it leads to quasi - spherical accretion , where the mass accretion rate can be extremely large but with near zero efficiency for the conversion of gravitational binding energy into thermal energy through shocks ( and subsequently radiation ) .",
    "a critical assessment of the outcome of collapsing cores has recently been given by dessart et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "much effort has been applied to explore the behavior of these systems in two dimensions , assuming azimuthal symmetry ( e.g. , proga et al .",
    "2003 , fujimoto et al .",
    "2006 , nagataki et al .",
    "2007 , nagataki 2009 , lpez - cmara et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 , sekiguchi & shibata 2011 )",
    ". however , relatively little work has been done in three dimensions , thus neglecting the potentially important role of the self ",
    "gravity of the infalling gas , and generic instabilities in 3d .",
    "the first study we are aware of was that carried out by rockefeller , fryer & li ( 2006 ) , and based on a @xmath4 rotating pop iii star .",
    "they observed the formation of instabilities within the disk , mainly as spiral waves , which contribute to angular momentum transport .",
    "more recently , taylor , miller & podsiadlowski ( 2010 ) , considered a very rapidly rotating progenitor , formed from the merger of two he stars .",
    "they also saw the development of instabilities in the disk and based on the observed energy release concluded that some of their models are indeed capable of producing a grb .",
    "we note that all of these models consider that the black hole is motionless at the origin of coordinates , which is a good approximation if the disk mass is negligible ( which may not be the case ) or if the infalling layers do not show strong asymmetries in their mass distribution .",
    "in this paper we focus on the dynamical effects in three dimensions , coming essentially from the self - gravity of the infalling gas and cooling , which occur during the initial stages of the collapse of a rotating polytropic envelope onto a central black hole in the context of the collapsar model . rather than make use of a very complex equation of state , we consider generic solutions with simplified cooling ( assumed to be through neutrinos ) .",
    "in particular , we pay special attention to the comparison between the cooling and dynamical time scales in order to gauge their effect on the formation of structure and the evolution of the mass accretion and energy losses .",
    "section  2 deals with our setup and input physics , section  3 presents our results , and our conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "in the context of the collapsar model , we studied the collapse and accretion of @xmath5 rotating polytropic envelopes with adiabatic index @xmath6 onto a @xmath7 bh fixed at the center of the mass distribution . in this section",
    "we will present the relevant details of the initial conditions and physical processes taken into account in our simulations which were carried out with gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ; springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) , which we have modified in order to include the necessary physics to account for accretion and cooling in this context .",
    "the polytropic envelope was constructed by solving the lane - emden equation for hydrostatic equilibrium ( see shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , from which we obtained radial profiles for the density and internal energy of @xmath8 polytropic stars with central density @xmath9 and @xmath6 . from the density profile we mapped a 3d particle distribution with",
    "an accept / reject montecarlo procedure . to account for the bh",
    ", we removed the innermost @xmath7 from this 3d polytropic star and concentrated it in a @xmath7 sink particle placed at the center of the distribution , leaving the remaining mass unaffected , now with inner radius @xmath10 . in table  [ table1 ] we show the total mass of the system @xmath11 , as well as the initial outer and inner radii of the polytropic envelope ( @xmath12 and @xmath10 respectively ) . from these quantities",
    "we can obtain a characteristic time scale @xmath13 from which all physical units are scaled in the code .",
    ".envelope and total system masses , along with the characteristic time scale @xmath14 and the outer and inner radius of the envelope . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we will first discuss the general features of the accretion process , such as the bh mass accretion rate @xmath15 , the evolution of the bh mass @xmath16 , and the energy loss rate @xmath17 , defined by the cooling times from table[table3 ] .",
    "these quantities will give us information on the general changes in the behavior of the system when implementing different cooling schemes .",
    "then we will study in detail some specific models , in order to look for a relation between these quantities s behavior and the disk s specific properties , or the cooling time scale itself .",
    "given that the polytropic envelope is intrinsically located at a distance @xmath18 from the bh at @xmath19 , the accretion will not begin until the innermost material reaches the center of the distribution .",
    "the time the envelope takes to reach the bh is affected by the gas pressure which , in the case of being negligible , would translate into a free - fall time of the envelope @xmath20 . in reality",
    ", gas pressure will make the envelope reach the bh at a slightly earlier time , @xmath21 .",
    "figure  7 shows the accreted mass as a function of time for all different models . in every case",
    ", accretion begins at a time @xmath22 depending on the cooling scheme .",
    "the more efficient the cooling , the more @xmath23 and the accreted mass increase . at the bottom panel of figure  [ mbh ]",
    "we can see the slowly cooled envelopes ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 & @xmath26 ) which resemble the adiabatic one ( red line ) the most .",
    "all these models show a smooth increase in the accreted mass for at least the first @xmath27 seconds .",
    "models @xmath25 and @xmath26 have an abrupt increase in the accreted mass after @xmath27 and @xmath28 s respectively . in the top panel , we can see the cooled envelopes with higher cooling efficiency ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 & @xmath31 ) which resemble the isothermal envelope ( red line ) the most .",
    "efficiently cooled models show abrupt changes in the accreted mass and considerably higher accreted mass than the slowly cooled ones .",
    "models with high cooling efficiency ( as well as the isothermal one ) are terminated at earlier times because of the computational demands imposed by an increasingly shorter time step in the final stages .",
    "special care was taken in order to keep the gas from cooling below @xmath32 , by imposing a threshold in the cooling subroutine so that the energy was lost only for gas with @xmath33  k.    figure  8 shows the evolution of the accretion mass rate for all models , whose first peak at @xmath34  s is due to the accretion of infalling material with low angular momentum . as material reaches the bh , a shock is formed and propagates outwards",
    ". if no cooling is enabled , the evolution is adiabatic , which will slow down the infalling material and prevent some of it from being accreted .",
    "meanwhile , with finite cooling , the shocked material is able to lose energy , and the shock is slowed down faster than in the adiabatic envelope .",
    "this translates into a higher accretion rate shown as a peak at @xmath35 s in figure  8 ( more distinguishable in the bottom panel ) .",
    "if the shock is strong enough to slow down the infalling material , the accretion rate will be diminished considerably .",
    "this , together with the exhaustion of low angular momentum material , translates into a decrease in the accretion rate , shown at times @xmath36 in figure  8 .",
    "this does nt seem to hold for models @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath37iso which show strong variations in @xmath38 after @xmath39  s. once the shock has passed through the whole envelope , material will settle around the bh and form an accretion disk , whose thickness decreases with increasing cooling efficiency , as expected . from this point on , material from the disk will be able to fall onto the bh if angular momentum transport occurs . this can be seen in the bottom panel of figure  8 around @xmath40  s , when the accretion rate has decreased by nearly one order of magnitude with respect to the initial peak .    as we can see from figure  [ mdot ] ,",
    "the slowly cooled models show smaller variations in the accretion rate @xmath41 than the more efficiently cooled ones . such variations must be due to a change in the way material is transported within the disk . particularly , model @xmath30 ( blue line in the top panel of figure  [ mdot ] ) shows several peaks in @xmath41 at times @xmath42  s. some quasi - periodic pattern may be present in the accretion rate of model @xmath30 , and it will be studied carefully below .",
    "models implemented with our cooling prescription will be loosing energy each time step at a rate @xmath43 .",
    "this cooling rate depends on the internal energy @xmath44 , at the position @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , energy losses wo nt be uniform throughout time and/or space .",
    "considering the contribution from each sph particle , we can obtain the total energy loss rate @xmath46 at a given time @xmath47 .",
    "energy loss rates @xmath48 ( i.e. , neutrino luminosities ) for different cooling efficiencies are showed in the bottom panel of figure  [ lum ] .",
    "the maximum @xmath48 is obtained for the model with higher cooling efficiency , reaching up to @xmath49 .",
    "the total energy lost @xmath50 is shown in the top panel of figure  [ lum ] , with a maximum value @xmath51 erg that is also reached by the most efficiently cooled model , in only @xmath52 .    as the cooling efficiency increases ,",
    "the changes in the energy loss rates @xmath48 become more drastic . by comparing figures  [ mdot ] and [ lum ]",
    ", we see that such abrupt changes coincide in time with intense increases in the accretion rates .",
    "given that a rapid increase in the energy loss rate @xmath48 is only possible if there is an increase in the internal energy ( @xmath53 ) , some mechanism must be causing the increase in the local internal energy @xmath54 . as these intense variations on both @xmath41 and @xmath48 appear as the cooling efficiency",
    "is improved , it seems logical to assume that the formation of structure within the accretion disk is triggering these variations .",
    "therefore , we study in detail the formation of structures , such as spiral arms , in order to look for a coincidence of structure formation events with the intense increases in both the accretion rate and the energy loss rate .    based on the obtained energy loss rates @xmath48 from our different models , and the assumption that the neutrino cooling would have a cooling time scale @xmath55 ranging within the cooling times @xmath56 explored here , we can expect to obtain neutrino luminosities @xmath57 ranging between @xmath58 ( depending on the local temperature and density conditions ) when a realistic neutrino prescription is used . an efficient neutrino cooling will be restricted to regions with really high temperatures ( @xmath59 k ) and densities ( @xmath60 ) , and this cooling mechanism wo nt be efficient during the initial collapse of the envelope , when the bulk of the gas has not yet reached the bh .",
    "this may affect the energy loss rates significantly at earlier times .",
    "moreover , here we do not consider the possibility of energy deposition from the cooling mechanism itself , which will be important for neutrino cooling at regions of high density ( @xmath61 ) when the opacity due to neutrons and @xmath62 particles becomes important ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "this may diminish the neutrino luminosity and could also prevent the material from cooling down so efficiently .      in order to look for characteristic time",
    "scales for the gas in the accretion disk , we performed fourier transforms of the time series for @xmath41 , @xmath48 and the cylindrical radial component of the momentum @xmath63 .",
    "any characteristic time scale occurring in them will appear as a peak in the fourier transform amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "figures  [ fou_1 ] and [ fou_2 ] show the fourier transforms for @xmath48 ( red line ) , @xmath41 ( blue line ) and @xmath63 ( black line ) for all models ( except @xmath48 for the adiabatic and isothermal models ) as a function of inverse frequency @xmath65 ( in seconds ) .",
    "figure  [ fou_1 ] shows that there is a transition in the peaks in @xmath64 for @xmath41 appearing at @xmath66  s when the cooling efficiency @xmath37 increases .",
    "these two peaks in @xmath41 also appear in @xmath48 for models @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but the peak at @xmath67  s is not that clear for model @xmath26 .",
    "the transform for @xmath48 also shows less intense peaks at time scales shorter than 0.02  s and longer than 0.001  s.    there are more characteristic time scales appearing on the cylindrical radial component of the momentum @xmath63 , and they become clearer on models with more efficient cooling than @xmath25 , with characteristic time scales ranging from @xmath68 to @xmath69  s. this range partly coincides with that associated to the epicyclic frequency due to the bh , which varies approximately from 0.001 to 0.1 seconds along the disk .",
    "there also seems to be an intense radial oscillation in the disk , seen in the transform for model @xmath29,with period @xmath70  s , as well as another oscillation of smaller intensity with period @xmath71  s. models with higher cooling efficiency also show the presence of a characteristic period in the range @xmath72  s.    comparing figures  [ fou_2 ] and [ fou_1 ] we can see that increasing the cooling efficiency increases the number of peaks appearing at higher frequencies ( smaller characteristic time scales ) in the fourier transforms .",
    "this coincides with the increase of variations in @xmath41 and @xmath48 seen when increasing the cooling efficiency .",
    "we note that only the more efficiently cooled models show significant variations on time scales shorter than 10 milliseconds , and as stated in the previous sections , these variations seem to be produced by the formation of instabilities in the disk",
    ".      if the formation of patterns in the disk is responsible for the rapid variations in both @xmath41 and @xmath48 , we must start by looking for instabilities that may gave rise to the formation of such structures .",
    "this can be done by looking for regions where local gravitational instability arises because of the high density and/or low pressure ( internal energy ) .",
    "this may be observable in density and/or internal energy maps in the disk plane .",
    "moreover , the appearance of any asymmetric structures in the disk could alter the angular momentum distribution and transport .",
    "spiral arms and high - density gas clumps can alter the gravitational interaction between the disk and the black hole and lead to the transport of angular momentum across the disk , independently of the presence of any viscous mechanism ( such as the magneto - rotational instability , mri ) .    in order to characterize nonaxisymmetric instabilities",
    ", we performed a one - dimensional fourier transform of the azimuthal distribution of mass @xmath73r\\ dr$ ] , as in the work of zurek & benz ( 1986 ) , defining the amplitude of the @xmath74-th mode by : @xmath75 the power in each mode , @xmath76 , will give us information about the presence of over - dense structures with @xmath77 azimuthal symmetry in the disk .",
    "therefore , the relative power @xmath78 will give us information on the intensity of @xmath74 spiral arms compared to the integrated disk mass @xmath79 , at time @xmath47 . by plotting the evolution in time of such relative powers @xmath80 we can study the evolution of the disk and look for the formation and disruption of spiral arms forming at the disk .",
    "such spiral structures should also be observable in density maps at the @xmath81 plane or , more appropriately , in the surface density , @xmath82 , maps as over - dense regions .",
    "nevertheless , in order to obtain quantitative information about the formation of structure in our simulations , we have found it more useful to study the evolution of the toomre parameter in the disk ( toomre 1964 ) , which provides insight on the conditions under which the accretion disk around the bh becomes unstable .",
    "the toomre parameter is given by : @xmath83 where , @xmath84 is the epicyclic frequency of motion for material in the disk , obtained from first order perturbations and subject to the effective potential @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the surface density of the disk , and @xmath87 is the local sound speed . by evaluating the toomre parameter @xmath88 throughout the disk",
    ", we should be able to notice the formation of any spiral structures , as a region with @xmath88 lower than the average value , given the higher surface density caused by its collapse .",
    "considering that we are only using @xmath88 as a parameter to visualize collapsing regions with significantly higher density and/or lower temperature , we will consider an approximation to the epicyclic frequency which neglects the contribution of the disk to the gravitational potential . the epicyclic frequency of a gas particle orbiting a bh with a pw potential is given by : @xmath89    this approximation will translate in values for @xmath90 that are 1.5 to 3.5 times smaller than those obtained directly from the simulation data , because of the self - gravity of the disk , but it will be significantly simpler to evaluate them uniformly thus . in the next section section we will study the morphology of some models individually , in order to obtain information on the importance of structure formation for the variability in the mass accretion and energy loss rates .",
    "we will focus on the models with @xmath91  s , which show the most significant variability .",
    "@xmath26 * model *    as with model @xmath25 , this model , with @xmath92 s , shows an abrupt change in both the accretion rate and the energy loss rate , but at an earlier time , @xmath93 s ( figure  [ fig : mlb134 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it also suggests there should be a structure formation event producing such variations . in figure",
    "[ fig : fourierb134 ] we see the evolution in time of the relative power @xmath80 for the modes @xmath94 , and there is an intense structure formation event starting at @xmath95 s , shown in every fourier mode in figure  [ fig : fourierb134 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath96 mode seems to be the most intense of all , and therefore , we expect to observe two spiral arms on the toomre parameter plots at @xmath93 s when it reaches its maximum .",

    "last panel from figure  [ fig : toomre1b134 ] shows the appearance of two spiral arms at @xmath93 s. these spiral arms are disrupted at @xmath99 s , but they are followed by the appearance of another two spiral arms on the following toomre parameter maps .",
    "this is also visible on the fourier mode @xmath96 showing strong variations at such times .",

    "this increase is also shown in the fourier modes in figure  [ fig : fourierb134 ] as strong variations in modes @xmath101 .",
    "there seems to be a relationship between the time of the first structure formation event and the cooling time , but the formation of structures should also depend on the amount of mass contained in the disk .",
    "as increasing the cooling efficiency allows more material to be accreted during the initial collapse , the disk s mass can be considerably reduced and therefore , the first structure formation event could be delayed due to the fact that the disk does not have enough material to become unstable until enough cooling has taken place .     for model @xmath26 at times @xmath102 .",

    "s all fourier modes reach a maximum value @xmath138 , which is not attained by less efficiently cooled models .",
    "this means that the mass ratio between the spiral structures and the disk s mass is greater than in previous models , which can be due to the fact that the bh has accreted a significantly greater amount of mass from the disk ( more than twice the mass accreted with respect to less efficiently cooled models ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : toomre2b0134 ] and [ fig : toomre3b0134 ] show the evolution of the toomre parameter @xmath97 at times @xmath139 , and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "as can be seen from both figures , @xmath97 reaches higher values within the disk , probably because the surface density is considerably lower after the rapid bh mass accretion .",
    "nevertheless , all regions ranging from green to blue have @xmath141 and it is clear that there are intense spiral structures and clumps forming in the disk .",
    "these clumps can be observed as early as @xmath129 s. in order to better appreciate the presence of instabilities in the disk ( regions with @xmath142 ) , we fixed a lower limit on the toomre parameter at 0.02 so that all regions with @xmath142 will have a color between blue and green ( @xmath97 reaches values as low as @xmath143 ) .",

    "we have further included a simplified prescription for cooling based on realistic emission rates expected at the given densities and temperatures within a collapsar , with which we can study scenarios ranging from adiabatic to isothermal , with the aim of identifying and characterizing the morphology and the variations in structure induced within the disk as a result of the energy losses to neutrinos . with these caveats , which we discuss further below , we find global features which are likely to be present in real collapsing stellar cores and are relevant for the dynamics and energy release leading to the production of cosmological grbs from massive stars .",
    "@xmath153 the most important parameter governing the energy release in the collapse of a stellar core in the context of a collapsar is the rotation rate . if it is too low , the gas will flow essentially in radial fashion , and accrete onto the central black hole releasing very little of its energy ( akin to bondi flow ) .",
    "if it is too high , the disk will form at a radius that may be too large for efficient cooling to kick in ( recall the sensitive dependence on neutrino emissivity on temperature ) , and the accretion efficiency may be too low to provide sufficient energy .",
    "it is the combination of placing shocked matter in centrifugal support as close to the bh as possible ( and hence deep in the potential well ) , but not allowing it to fall in , that is critical for a successful event . in 2d",
    ", this has been characterized before ( lee & ramirez - ruiz 2006 , lpez - cmara et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) , and it is plainly important in 3d as well . in this sense , modeling the black hole through the pseudo potential of paczynski & wiita ( 1980 ) is the most important ingredient as far as gravitational effects are concerned , which is why we have adopted it in the present work . of course ,",
    "considering a rotating bh may change the quantitative results somewhat , but not the qualitative nature of this conclusion .",
    "@xmath153 increasing the cooling efficiency induces more profuse and intense structure formation which in turn produces strong variations both in the mass accretion rate and the energy losses .",
    "the duration and intensity of these variations is related with the intensity and lifetime of the collapsed structures , whether they are spiral arms or clumps .",
    "structures with a toomre parameter @xmath154 and high relative power @xmath80 contain considerable amounts of gas within compact regions , and can therefore be accreted quickly , leading to large variations in @xmath41 and @xmath48 .",
    "the frequency of these variations ( and structure formation ) increases with rising cooling efficiency , as observed in the fourier power spectra of @xmath41 and @xmath48 s .",
    "@xmath153 the spiral structures that form are clearly transient in nature , forming and disappearing within a few orbital periods .",
    "their relative power is particularly strong in the lowest azimuthal modes , @xmath119 at modest cooling , when @xmath155 and rapidly spreads to higher modes , @xmath156 for increasing cooling efficiency , when @xmath157 .",
    "@xmath153 the spiral structure and gas clumps in the disk not only induce intense variations ( with different durations ) in both @xmath41 and @xmath48 , but are also significant enough to break the symmetry in gravitational interaction between the disk and the black hole .",
    "this can be seen in figures  [ fou_1 ] and [ fou_2 ] where the fourier transforms of the radial momentum component @xmath63 of the disk are shown . as cooling becomes more efficient , greater power is seen at higher frequencies ( shorter time scales ) in @xmath63 .",
    "such characteristic frequencies are easily noticeable just by looking the time series of the components of momentum @xmath158 and @xmath159 separately , where one can identify a `` periodic '' oscillation of the accretion disk . by forcing the bh to remain fixed at the origin during the simulations , we can not here give a full account of this effect , but clearly these oscillations could have important consequences for the overall dynamics of the flow and are further discussed below .",
    "@xmath153 the integrated energy losses obtained range from 1 to 2000 foe ( @xmath160 to @xmath161 erg ) for adiabatic to isothermal models .",
    "now , this is only what would count as `` neutrino '' energy release .",
    "the integrated accretion energy @xmath162 ranges from @xmath161 to @xmath163 erg .",
    "both of these indicate that as expected , the available power to drive a grb is present in the system . how it eventually manages to do so is a different matter , but , more to the point here , it is clear that the time variations imprinted on the outflow are dependent on the initial mechanism driving it .",
    "this is in way akin to the argument presented in carballido & lee ( 2011 ) , where temporal variability in local shearing box simulations for different neutrino cooling prescriptions , when integrated over the entire disk on a large scale , produces a different and characteristic power spectrum which is the underlying shape upon which further processes are superimposed , each adding its typical signature layer of behavior .",
    "@xmath153 the formation and destruction of accretion structures , in particular arms and clumps , is not only transient , but recurrent in an orderly fashion .",
    "inspection of figures  [ mdot ] and [ lum ] , where the mass accretion rates and energy release are plotted , shows that for greater efficiency , the interval between enhancements in @xmath41 and @xmath48 is smaller .",
    "the disk is draining of matter in the process as well , of course , and so each subsequent episode is of lesser intensity .",
    "but the trend appears to be clear : as structure forms , the disruption of azimuthal symmetry allows for a degree of angular momentum transport through the dense spiral arms ( or even clumps ) , leading to an accretion episode .",
    "having suppressed this structure , a second cooling interval must elapse before new condensations form and allow the process to repeat , indicating a correlation between the time elapsed between accretion ( or luminosity ) spikes and the cooling time itself . for decreasing cooling times",
    "the disk is being depleted ever faster and so the trend becomes increasingly difficult to see ( note the accretion rate and luminosity are plotted in a logarithmic scale ) .",
    "@xmath153 given our cooling implementation , eq .",
    "( [ cooling ] ) , the internal energy per unit mass of the accretion disk @xmath164 is directly related to the energy loss rate @xmath165 by : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the internal energy of the particle @xmath168 and @xmath169 is the mass of the accretion disk at time @xmath47 .",
    "thus , @xmath170 contains information on both the energy loss rate and the accretion rate ( determining the disk s remaining mass ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath170 as a function of the normalized time @xmath171 , shows some intrinsic properties of this particular cooling scenario .",
    "figure [ umass ] shows the normalized internal energy per unit mass @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) as a function of @xmath174 for all simulations with our cooling prescription , eq .",
    "[ cooling ] .",
    "all models show the initial decrease in @xmath175 due to the cooling and collapse of the envelope , followed by an intense increase from the outward shock produced by the heated material reaching its centrifugal barrier near the black hole .",
    "both of these events take place at times @xmath176 and therefore , models with @xmath177 will start accreting and will have formed an accretion disk at times @xmath178 . meanwhile models with @xmath179 will form an accretion disk only after several cooling times have elapsed .",
    "models displaying such scenarios are intrinsically different , and hence we do not expect to observe similar behavior when comparing them",
    ". models with @xmath177 display an increase in @xmath175 at a time @xmath180 , which corresponds to the structure formation event previously noted in models @xmath181 ,",
    "@xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the exception to this trend is model @xmath184 , which shows no significant increase in @xmath175 and no structure formation event at such times .",
    "the exception can be explained by considering the minimum azimuthally averaged sound speed in the disk @xmath185 , from which we can estimate an upper limit for the time , @xmath186 , it would take a pressure perturbation to transfer its information throughout a disk of size @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , this perturbation could be induced precisely by cooling .",
    "thus , if the cooling time scale is smaller than this perturbation time scale @xmath187 , there is a region within the disk where any significant drop in pressure ( brought about by a reduction in the internal energy ) , could not be immediately compensated by hydrodynamical processes and it could experience a collapse if the pressure drop is strong enough .",
    "on the other hand , if the cooling time scale is significantly higher than @xmath187 , any drop in pressure will be quickly accounted for , and softened , by hydrodynamical processes before the gas gets cool enough to undergo collapse .",
    "this is the case in model @xmath184 which , at all times , satisfies @xmath188 , as seen on figure [ cs_t ] where the evolution of @xmath189 vs @xmath174 is plotted .",
    "hence , we do not expect to see any structure formation event from this model as long as the the condition @xmath190 is not satisfied .",
    "@xmath153 first , a more detailed implementation of neutrino cooling is likely to lead to more realistic results .",
    "particularly , this refers to the fact that we have assumed a uniform cooling efficiency throughout the flow , @xmath37 . as the temperature dependence of cooling is significant",
    ", the outer regions will not emit as copiously as the inner disk , leading to different behavior .",
    "we believe this is one of the two most important points which would require addressing .",
    "@xmath153 we have alluded to the second above already , namely , that the gravitational interaction between the disk and the black hole does not always allow one to assume that the latter is always lying at the origin . rather , it will oscillate with the disk , as in a binary .",
    "this has two important consequences : first , the accretion rate will be modified somewhat , as clumps and spiral arms will not be disrupted / accreted in the same way , and second , the site of accretion , and potential jet driving through the envelope , will be in continuous motion within the disk and stellar envelope .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this is effect is clearly necessary , and it may have far - reaching consequences , as the common assumption has been that the energy deposition driving a relativistic outflow leading to breakout sits motionless at the center of the star .",
    "@xmath153 although the pw pseudo potential , as mentioned above , captures the most essentially feature of general relativity for accretion purposes , a full relativistic treatment of the problem is desirable .",
    "in particular , not only the effects of a spinning ( kerr ) black hole , but of the field produced by the flow itself , which , as we have seen , can in some cases produce a significant pull on the central object .",
    "@xmath153 finally , a proper treatment of neutrinos should consider the effects of neutrino transport and energy deposition .",
    "since the emitted neutrinos could be able to deposit a significant amount of energy in the gas at high density regions ( @xmath191 ) due to inelastic scattering off free nucleons and @xmath62 particles , and because of neutrino opacity effects even in the elastic scattering regime , some of the structure formation we see may be inhibited , or limited , preventing the formation of the densest features .",
    "the rich behavior seen here , and characterized for the first time in 3d , clearly shows that using only 2d studies of the collapse of stellar cores is insufficient to explain all of the behavior and variability , even qualitatively , that is likely to occur in such systems . as we already know that only a small fraction of collapsing massive stars will produce a grb , it is relevant in the sense of identifying precisely which conditions will lead to one in the evolution of the star .",
    "preliminary work on the first two topics , in particular the disk - bh interaction , leads us to believe that these may be significant for the behavior and evolution of collapsar disks , and they will be the subject of future work .",
