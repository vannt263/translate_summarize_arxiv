    "the design and characterization of strategies for controlling quantum dynamics is vital to a broad spectrum of applications within contemporary physics and engineering .",
    "these range from traditional coherent - control settings like high - resolution nuclear  @xcite and molecular spectroscopy  @xcite , to a variety of tasks motivated by the rapidly growing field of quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ability to counteract decoherence effects that unavoidably arise in the dynamics of a real - world quantum system coupled to its surrounding environment is a prerequisite for scalable realizations of quantum information processing ( qip ) , as actively pursued through a variety of proposed device technologies  @xcite .",
    "active decoupling techniques offer a conceptually simple yet powerful control - theoretic setting for quantum - dynamical engineering of both closed - system ( unitary ) and open - system ( non - unitary ) evolutions .",
    "inspired by the idea of _ coherent averaging _ of interactions by means of tailored pulse sequences in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy  @xcite , decoupling protocols consist of repetitive sequences of control operations ( typically drawn from a finite repertoire ) , whose net effect is to coherently modify the natural target dynamics to a desired one . in practice , a critical decoupling task is the selective removal of unwanted couplings between subsystems of a fully or partially controllable composite quantum system .",
    "historically , a prototype example is the elimination of unwanted phase evolution in interacting spin systems via trains of @xmath0-pulses ( the so - called hahn - echo and carr - purcell sequences  @xcite ) . for open quantum systems",
    ", this line of reasoning motivates the question of whether removing the coupling between the system of interest and its environment may be feasible by a control action restricted to the former only .",
    "such a question was addressed in  @xcite for the paradigmatic case of a single qubit coupled to a bosonic reservoir , establishing the possibility of decoherence suppression in the limit of rapid spin flipping via the echo sequence mentioned above .",
    "the study of dynamical decoupling as a general strategy for quantum coherent and error control has since then attracted a growing interest from the point of view of both model - independent decoupling design and optimization , and the application to specific physical systems .",
    "representative contributions include the extension to arbitrary finite - dimensional systems via dynamical - algebraic  @xcite , geometric  @xcite , and linear - algebraic  @xcite formulations ; the construction of fault - tolerant eulerian  @xcite and concatenated decoupling protocols  @xcite , as well as efficient combinatorial schemes  @xcite ; the connection with quantum zeno physics  @xcite ; proposed applications to the compensation of specific decoherence mechanisms ( notably , magnetic state decoherence  @xcite and 1/@xmath1 noise  @xcite ) and/or the removal of unwanted evolution within trapped - ion  @xcite and solid - state quantum computing architectures  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical advances have been paralleled by steady experimental progress .",
    "beginning with a proof - of - principle demonstration of decoherence suppression in a single - photon polarization interferometer  @xcite , dynamical decoupling techniques have been implemented alone and in conjunction with quantum error correction within liquid - state nmr qip  @xcite , and have inspired charge - based  @xcite and flux - based  @xcite echo experiments in superconducting qubits .",
    "recently , dynamic decoherence control of a solid - state nuclear quadrupole qubit has been reported  @xcite .",
    "all the formulations of dynamical decoupling mentioned so far share the feature of involving purely _ deterministic _ control actions . in the simplest",
    "setting , these are arbitrarily strong , effectively instantaneous rotations ( so - called _ bang - bang controls _ ) chosen from a discrete group @xmath2 .",
    "decoupling according to @xmath2 is then accomplished by sequentially cycling the control propagator through _ all _ the elements of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 denotes the separation between consecutive control operations , this translates into a minimal averaging time scale @xmath4 , of length proportional to the size @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "the exploration of decoupling schemes incorporating _",
    "stochastic _ control actions was only recently undertaken .",
    "a general control - theoretic framework was introduced by viola and knill in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , based on the idea of seeking faster convergence ( with respect to an appropriately defined metric ) by _ randomly sampling _ rather than systematically implementing control operations from @xmath2 .",
    "based on general lower bounds for pure - state error probabilities , the analysis of  @xcite indicated that random schemes could outperform their cyclic counterpart in situations where a large number of elementary control operations is required or , even for small control groups , when the interactions to be removed vary themselves in time over time scales long compared to @xmath3 but short compared to @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , it also suggested that advantageous features of pure cyclic and random methods could be enhanced by appropriately merging protocols within a hybrid design .",
    "the usefulness of randomization in the context of actively suppressing _ coherent _ errors due to residual static interactions was meanwhile independently demonstrated by the so - called _ pauli random error correction method _ ( parec ) , followed by the more recent _ embedded dynamical decoupling method _  both due to kern and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "both protocols may be conceptually understood as following from randomization over the pauli group @xmath8 , used alone or , respectively , in conjunction with a second set of deterministic control operations .",
    "our goal in this work is twofold : first , to develop a quantitative understanding of _ typical _ randomized control performance for both _ coherent and decoherent phase errors _ , beginning from the simplest scenario of a single qubit already investigated in detail in the deterministic case  @xcite ; second , to clarify the _ physical _ picture underlying random control , by devoting , in particular , special attention to elucidate the control action and requirements in rotating frames associated with different dynamical representations .",
    "the fact that the controlled dynamics remains exactly solvable in the bang - bang ( bb ) limit makes the single - qubit pure - dephasing setting an ideal test - bed for these purposes . from a general standpoint ,",
    "since spin - flip decoupling corresponds to averaging over the smallest ( nontrivial ) group @xmath9 , with @xmath10  @xcite , this system is not yet expected to show the full advantage of the random approach .",
    "remarkably , however , control scenarios can still be identified , where randomized protocols indeed represent the most suitable choice .",
    "the content of the paper is organized as follows . after laying out the relevant system and control settings in sect .",
    "ii , we begin the comparison between cyclic and randomized protocols by studying the task of phase refocusing in a qubit evolving unitarily in sect .",
    "control of decoherence from purely dephasing semiclassical and quantum environments is investigated in the main part of the paper , sects .",
    "iv and v. we focus on the relevant situations of decoherence due to random telegraph noise and to a fully quantum bosonic bath , respectively . both exact analytical and numerical results for the controlled decoherence process are presented in the latter case .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their significance from the broader perspective of constructively exploiting randomness in physical systems in sect .",
    "vi , by also pointing to some directions for future research .",
    "additional technical considerations are included in a separate appendix .",
    "our target system @xmath11 is a single qubit , living on a state space @xmath12 .",
    "the influence of the surrounding environment may be formally accounted for by two main modifications to the isolated qubit dynamics .",
    "first , @xmath11 may couple to effectively _ classical _ degrees of freedom , whose net effect may be modeled through a deterministic or random time - dependent modification of the system parameters . additionally , @xmath11 may couple to a _",
    "quantum _ environment @xmath13 , that is , a second quantum system defined on a state space @xmath14 with which @xmath11 may become entangled in the course of the evolution . for the present purposes , @xmath13 will be schematized as a bosonic reservoir consisting of independent harmonic modes .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the identity operator on @xmath16 , respectively . throughout the paper",
    ", we will consider different dynamical scenarios , corresponding to special cases of the following total drift hamiltonian on @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 here , we set @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote pauli spin matrices , and canonical creation and annihilation bosonic operators of the @xmath25th environmental mode with frequency @xmath26 , respectively . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real and complex functions that account for an effectively time - dependent frequency of the system and its coupling to the @xmath25th reservoir mode , respectively .",
    "we shall write @xmath29 for an appropriate choice of central values @xmath30 , @xmath31 and modulation functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the adimensional parameter @xmath34 is introduced for notational convenience , allowing to include ( @xmath35 ) or not ( @xmath36 ) the coupling to @xmath13 as desired .",
    "physically , because @xmath37 and @xmath38 commute at all times , the above hamiltonian describes a _ purely decohering _ coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath13 , which does not entail energy exchange . while in general dissipation might also occur , focusing on pure decoherence is typically justified for sufficiently short time scales  @xcite and , as we shall see , has the advantage of making exact solutions available as benchmarks .",
    "control is introduced by adjoining a classical controller acting on @xmath11 , that is by adding a time - dependent term to the above target hamiltonian , @xmath39 in our case , @xmath40 will be designed so as to implement appropriate sequences of bb pulses .",
    "this may be accomplished by starting from a rotating radiofrequency field ( or , upon invoking the rotating wave approximation , by a linearly - polarized oscillating field ) , described by the following amplitude- and phase - modulated hamiltonian : @xmath41 \\sigma_x +   \\sin[\\omega t + \\varphi_j ( t ) ] \\sigma_y \\hspace*{-.5mm}\\big ) \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath42\\:.\\ ] ] here , @xmath43 denotes the heaviside step function ( defined as @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are positive parameters , and @xmath50 denotes the instants at which the pulses are applied . if the carrier frequency is tuned on resonance with the central frequency , @xmath51 , and the phase @xmath52 for each @xmath53 , the above hamiltonian schematizes a train of _ identical _ control pulses of amplitude @xmath48 and duration @xmath49 in the physical frame . under the bb requirement of impulsive switching ( @xmath54 ) with unbounded strength ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "it is legitimate to neglect @xmath56 ( including possible off - resonant effects ) within each pulse , effectively leading to qubit rotations about the @xmath57-axis . in particular",
    ", a @xmath0 rotation corresponds to @xmath58 ( see also appendix a ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we shall focus on using trains of bb @xmath0-pulses to effectively achieve a net evolution characterized by the identity operator ( the so - called _ no - op _ gate ) .",
    "this requires averaging unwanted ( coherent or decoherent ) @xmath59 evolution generated by either @xmath37 or @xmath38 or both , by subjecting the system to repeated spin - flips . in group - theoretic terms",
    "such protocols have , as mentioned , a transparent interpretation as implementing an average over the group @xmath60 , represented on @xmath61 as @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "the quantum operation effecting such group averaging is the projector @xmath63 on the space of operators commuting with @xmath64 , leading to @xmath65 essentially , in _ cyclic _ decoupling schemes based on @xmath2 the above symmetrization is accomplished through a _ time _ average of the effective hamiltonian determining the evolution over a cycle , @xmath7 ; in _ random _ schemes , it emerges from an _ ensemble _ average over different control histories , taken with respect to the uniform probability measure over @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "neither deterministic nor stochastic sequences of @xmath0 pulses achieve an exact implementation of @xmath67 for a fully generic hamiltonian as in eqs .",
    "( [ drift0])-([drift ] ) , except in the ideal limit of arbitrarily fast control where the separation between pulses approaches zero .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to compare the performance attainable by different control sequences for realistic control rates . in this paper",

    "a quantitative comparison between deterministic and randomized control for the most elementary target system , consisting of a single ( isolated or open ) qubit , was developed in different frames .",
    "the main conclusions emerging from this study may be summarized as follows .",
    "first , it is always possible to identify conditions under which purely random or hybrid schemes succeed at achieving the desired level of dynamical control .",
    "frame considerations play an important role in specifying such conditions , satisfactory performance in a given frame being ultimately determined by a hierarchy of time scales associated with all the dynamical components in the relevant hamiltonian .",
    "while all protocols become essentially equivalent in the limit of arbitrarily fast control , the behavior for finite pulse separation is rich and rather sensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics . as a drawback of pure random design , ensemble average tends to introduce , in general , additional phase damping , which may be however circumvented by combining determinism and randomness within a hybrid design .",
    "second , for time - independent control settings in this simple system , it was always possible to identify a deterministic protocol with best performance .",
    "while deterministic schemes ensuring accurate averaging of a known interaction always exist in principle  @xcite , such a conclusion remains to be verified under more general circumstances , in particular access to a _ restricted _ set of control operations .",
    "the hybrid protocol proved superior to the pure random schemes , as well as to standard asymmetric schemes in certain situations .",
    "third , for time - varying systems , randomized protocols typically allow for enhanced stability against parameter variations , which may severely hamper the performance of deterministic schemes .",
    "pure random design tends to perform better than hybrid in this respect , both choices , however , improving over purely cyclic controls under appropriate conditions .",
    "overall , hybrid design emerges as a preferred strategy for merging advantageous features from different protocols , thereby allowing to better compromise between conflicting needs .      from a conceptual standpoint , it is intriguing to realize that complete suppression of decoherence remains possible , in principle , by purposefully introducing a probabilistic component in the underlying control , and perhaps surprising to identify cases where this leads to improved efficiency over pure deterministic methods .    in a broader context",
    ", however , it is worth mentioning that the philosophy of recognizing a beneficial role of randomness in physical processes has a long history . within nmr , the stochastic averaging of intermolecular interactions in gases and isotropic liquids due to random translational and re - orientational motions",
    "may be thought of as a naturally occurring random self - decoupling process  @xcite .",
    "in spectroscopic applications of so - called stochastic nmr and stochastic magnetic - resonance imaging  @xcite , spin excitation via trains of weak rf pulses randomly modulated in amplitude , phase , and/or frequency are used to enhance decoupling efficiencies over a broader frequency bandwidth than attainable otherwise . even more generally , the phenomenon of stochastic resonance  @xcite is paradigmatic in terms of pointing to a constructive role of noise in the transmission of physical signals . within qip ,",
    "strategies aimed at taking advantage of noise and/or stochasticity have been considered in contexts ranging from quantum games  @xcite , to quantum walks  @xcite , dissipation - assisted quantum computation  @xcite , as well as specific coherent - control  @xcite and quantum simulation  @xcite scenarios . yet another suggestive example is offered by the work of prosen and nidari , who have shown how static perturbations characterizing faulty gates may enhance the stability of quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "more recently , as mentioned , both pure random  @xcite and hybrid  @xcite active compensation schemes for static coherent errors have been proposed . while it is important to stress that none of the above applications stem from a general _ control - theoretic framework _ as developed in  @xcite , it is still rewarding to fit such different examples within a unifying perspective .    our present analysis should be regarded as a first step toward a better understanding and exploitation of the possibilities afforded by randomization for coherent and decoherent error control . as such",
    ", it should be expanded in several directions , including more realistic control systems and settings , and fault - tolerance considerations . while we plan to report on that elsewhere , it is our hope that our work will stimulate fresh perspectives on further probing the interplay between the field of coherent quantum control and the world of randomness .",

    "the control hamiltonian is designed according to the intended modification of the target dynamics in a desired frame . throughout this work",

    ", this requires the use of _ identical @xmath0-pulses in the physical frame_. this condition may be relaxed at the expense of no longer refocusing the unitary evolution .",
