    "our study is motivated by solving the conditional density function of the states of certain nonlinear filtering .",
    "the conditional density function satisfies a linear parabolic pde , which comes from the robust duncan - mortensen - zakai equation after some exponential transformation , see @xcite , @xcite . we need to solve this equation in @xmath0 , since the states lived in the whole space , where @xmath1 is the number of the states .",
    "moreover , the real - time solution is expected in the filtering problems , so it is natural to adopt the spectral methods . among the existing literature ,",
    "the hermite and laguerre spectral methods are the commonly used approaches based on orthogonal polynomials in infinite interval , referring to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although the hermite spectral method ( hsm ) appears to be a natural choice , it is not commonly used as chebyshev and fourier spectral method , due to its poor resolution ( see @xcite ) and the lack of fast algorithm for the transformation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is shown in @xcite that an appropriately chosen scaling factor could greatly improve the resolution",
    ". some further investigations on the scaling factor can be found in @xcite and also in chapter 7 , @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently a guideline of choosing the suitable scaling factors for gaussian / super - gaussian functions is described in @xcite , as well as the application of hsm to 1-dim forward kolmogorov equation .    nevertheless , the number of the states is generally greater than one . taking the target tracking problem in 3-dim as an example , there are at least six states involved in this system ( three for position , three for velocity ) .",
    "that is , we need to solve a linear parabolic pde in @xmath2 . naively , if we implement the spectral method with tensor product formulation and assume the first @xmath3 modes need to be computed in each direction , then the total amount of the computation is @xmath4 . even if with moderately small @xmath3 , it is still not within the reasonable computing capacity .",
    "this is the so - called  curse of dimensionality \" .",
    "an efficient tool to reduce this effect is the sparse grids approximations from smolyak s algorithm @xcite , which is based on a hierarchy of one - dimensional quadrature .",
    "it has a potential to obtain higher rates of convergence than many existing methods , under certain regularity conditions .",
    "for example , the convergence rate of monte carlo simulations are @xmath5 with @xmath3 sample points , while the sparse grids from @xcite achieves @xmath6 , under the condition that the function has bounded mix derivatives of order @xmath7 .",
    "the studies of sparse grids start from the basis functions in the physical spaces : piecewise linear multiscale bases @xcite , wavelets @xcite , @xcite . in the recent one decade , the hyperbolic cross ( hc ) approximation in the frequency space",
    "has also been investigated with various basis functions : fourier series @xcite , @xcite , polynomial approximations generated from the chebyshev - gauss - lobatto points @xcite , jacobi polynomials @xcite .",
    "although the regular hyperbolic cross ( rhc ) approximation reduces the effect of the  curse of dimensionality \" in some degree , the convergence rate is still deteriorated slowly with the dimension increasing ( noting the term @xmath8 in the previous paragraph ) . to completely break the  curse of dimensionality \" , the optimized hyperbolic cross ( ohc ) approximation is introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the convergence rate of the ohc approximation with @xmath9 ( see definition in ) with fourier series is of @xmath10 in our notation , where the dimension enters the constant in front .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to establish the error estimate for the hc approximations with the generalized hermite functions in the weighted korobov spaces @xmath11 , see . in particular , we obtain the following results for the rhc / ohc approximation with the generalized hermite functions .",

    "the error estimates in appropriate weighted korobov spaces are investigated under various conditions ( cf .",
    "conditions @xmath31-@xmath32 in section 3 ) .",
    "there also exist rich literatures of the applications of sparse grids algorithm to solve equations .",
    "it has already been successfully applied to problems from the integral equations @xcite , to interpolation and approximation @xcite , to the stochastic differential equations @xcite , @xcite , to high dimensional integration problems from physics and finance @xcite , and to the solutions to elliptic pdes , @xcite , @xcite . as to the parabolic pdes ,",
    "they are treated with a wavelet - based sparse grid discretization in @xcite .",
    "besides the finite element approaches , they are also handled with finite differences on sparse grids @xcite and finite volumn schemes @xcite .",
