    "when the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction energy @xmath0 is larger than their kinetic energy , electrons in the bloch band are `` dressed '' by phonons . if phonon frequencies are very low , the local lattice deformation traps the electron even in a perfect crystal lattice .",
    "this _ self - trapping _",
    "phenomenon was predicted by landau @xcite .",
    "it has been studied in greater detail by pekar @xcite , frhlich @xcite , feynman @xcite , devreese @xcite and other authors in the effective mass approximation , which leads to the so - called _ large _ or _ continuous _ polaron .",
    "the large polaron propagates through the lattice as a free electron but with an enhanced effective mass .    in the strong - coupling regime ,",
    "@xmath1 the finite bandwidth @xmath2 becomes important , so that the effective mass approximation can not be applied .",
    "the electron is called a _ small _ or _ lattice _ polaron in this regime .",
    "the self - trapping is never `` complete '' , that is any polaron can tunnel through the lattice . only in the extreme _",
    "limit , when the phonon frequencies tend to zero , the self - trapping is complete , and the polaron motion is no longer translationally continuous .",
    "the main features of the small polaron were understood by tjablikov @xcite , yamashita and kurosava @xcite , sewell @xcite , holstein @xcite and his school @xcite , lang and firsov @xcite , eagles @xcite , and others and described in several review papers and textbooks @xcite .",
    "an exponential reduction of the bandwidth at large values of @xmath3 and phonon side - bands are among those features .",
    "the lattice deformation also strongly affects the interaction between electrons . at large distances polarons",
    "repel each other in ionic crystals , but their coulomb repulsion is substantially reduced due to the ion polarization .",
    "nevertheless two @xmath4 polarons can be bound into a @xmath5 bipolaron by an exchange interaction even with no additional e - ph interaction but the frhlich one @xcite .",
    "when a short - range deformation potential and molecular - type ( i.e. jahn - teller @xcite ) e - ph interactions are taken into account together with the frhlich interaction @xcite , they can overcome the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the resulting interaction becomes attractive at a short distance of about a lattice constant .",
    "then two small polarons easily form a bound state , i.e. a @xmath6 bipolaron , because their band is narrow . consideration of particular lattice structures shows that small bipolarons are mobile even when the electron - phonon coupling is strong and the bipolaron binding energy is large @xcite .",
    "hence the polaronic fermi liquid transforms into a bose liquid of double - charged carriers in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the bose - liquid is stable because bipolarons repel each other @xcite .",
    "here we encounter a novel electronic state of matter , a charged bose liquid , qualitatively different from the normal fermi - liquid and from the bcs superfluid .",
    "experimental evidence for an exceptionally strong electron - phonon interaction in high temperature superconductors is now overwhelming . as we discussed in detail elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the extension of the bcs theory towards the strong interaction between electrons and ion vibrations describes the phenomenon naturally .",
    "high temperature superconductivity exists in the crossover region of the electron - phonon interaction strength from the bcs - like to bipolaronic superconductivity as was predicted before @xcite , and explored in greater detail by many authors after the discovery @xcite .",
    "small polarons with their phonon side - bands and attractive correlations are quite feasible also in molecular nanowires and quantum dots ( mqd ) used as the `` transmission lines '' @xcite and active molecular elements @xcite in molecular - scale electronics @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated that the low - bias conductance of molecules is dominated by resonant tunneling through coupled electronic and vibration levels @xcite .",
    "conductance peaks due to electron - vibron interactions has been seen in c@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "different aspects of the electron - phonon / vibron ( e - ph ) interaction effect on the tunneling through molecules and quantum dots ( qd ) have been studied by several authors @xcite . in particular , glazman and shekhter , and later wingreen _ et",
    "al._@xcite presented the exact resonant - tunneling transmission probability fully taking into account the e - ph interaction on a nondegenerate resonant site .",
    "phonons produced transmission side - bands but did not affect the integral transmission probability .",
    "li , chen and zhou @xcite studied the conductance of a double degenerate ( due to spin ) quantum dot with coulomb repulsion and the e - ph interaction .",
    "their numerical results also showed the side - band peaks and the main peak related to the coulomb repulsion , which was decreased by the e - ph interaction .",
    "kang @xcite studied the boson ( vibron ) assisted transport through a double - degenerate qd coupled to two _ superconducting _ leads and found multiple peaks in the i - v curves , which originated from the singular bcs density of states and the phonon side - bands .    while a correlated transport through mesoscopic systems with repulsive electron - electron interactions received considerable interest in the past , and continues to be the focus of intense investigations @xcite , much less has been known about a role of attractive correlations in mqd .",
    "recently we have proposed a negative@xmath8 hubbard model of a @xmath9-fold degenerate quantum dot @xcite .",
    "we argued that the _ attractive _ electron correlations caused by a strong electron - phonon ( vibron ) interaction in the molecule , and/or by the valence fluctuations provide a molecular switching effect , when the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics show two branches with high and low current for the same voltage .",
    "the effect was observed in a few experimental studies with complex @xcite and simple molecules @xcite .",
    "here we review the analytical theory of a _ correlated _ transport through a degenerate molecule quantum dot ( mqd ) fully taking into account both coulomb and e - ph interactions @xcite .",
    "we show that the phonon side - bands significantly modify the switching behavior of the i - v curves in comparison with the negative-@xmath10 hubbard model @xcite . nevertheless , the switching effect is robust .",
    "it shows up when the effective interaction of polarons is attractive and the state of the dot is multiply degenerate , @xmath11 .",
    "employing the canonical polaron formalism with a generic `` frhlich - coulomb '' hamiltonian , allows us explicitly calculate the effective attraction of small polarons @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian includes the infinite - range coulomb , @xmath12 and electron - phonon interactions .",
