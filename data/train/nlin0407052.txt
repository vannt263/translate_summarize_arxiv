    "the idea of using chaos to design analog secure communication systems and digital ciphers has provoked a great deal of research efforts since the early 1990s @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , security analysis of various proposed chaotic cryptosystems also attracts increasing attention , and some chaotic cryptosystems have been found insecure @xcite .",
    "most analog chaos - based secure communication systems are based on chaos synchronization technique @xcite , where the receiver ( response or slave ) chaotic system synchronizes with the transmitter ( drive or master ) system via a signal transmitted over a public channel .",
    "after the chaos synchronization is achieved , the plain - signal can be recovered in different ways corresponding to different structures of the encryption algorithms . according to the method used for encrypting the plain - signal , there are four common types of chaos synchronization - based encryption structures @xcite : chaotic masking , chaotic switching ( or chaotic shift keying - csk ) , chaotic modulation and inverse system approach . since",
    "many early chaos - based secure communication systems are found insecure against various attacking methods , some countermeasures have been proposed in the hope of enhancing the security : 1 ) using more complex dynamical systems , such as hyperchaotic systems or multiple cascaded heterogeneous chaotic systems @xcite ; 2 ) adding traditional ciphers into the whole cryptosystem @xcite ; 3 ) introducing a discrete - time impulsive signal instead of a continuous signal to realize synchronization @xcite . the first countermeasure has been found not secure enough against some attacks @xcite , and some security defects of the second have also been reported @xcite , but the last one has not yet been broken to date .    in @xcite , as a new way to enhance the security of chaos - based secure communications , a new synchronization method was proposed for multiple discrete - time dynamical systems driven by a common random signal .",
    "dynamical systems synchronized in this way work in intermittent chaotic states , i.e. , alternatively switching between chaotic and periodic regimes . in @xcite , this new synchronization method was used to construct a new secure communication scheme , in which the two synchronized intermittently - chaotic systems generate the same pseudo - random keystream .",
    "the pseudo - random keystream is then used for encrypting the plaintext at the transmitter end , and for decrypting the ciphertext at the receiver , via a piecewise linear encryption / decryption function originally used in @xcite .",
    "the core of this secure communication scheme is the key - generation process based on the two discrete - time intermittently - chaotic systems . in @xcite",
    ", it was claimed that the key - generation process is very sensitive to the mismatch of the secret key so it is very secure against attacks . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this secure communication scheme is the first and the only one based on intermittent chaos , and it has not been cryptanalyzed before .",
    "this paper analyzes the security of the above - referred secure communication scheme , and reveals some of its security defects : 1 ) some secret parameters ( i.e. , sub - keys ) can be eliminated or directly estimated from the ciphertext , so that the available key - space is drastically reduced ; 2 ) the decryption is largely insensitive to the mismatch of the secret key ; 3 ) the chaos - based key - generation process is insecure against known / chosen - plaintext attacks .",
    "the first two defects mean that this communication scheme is not secure enough against brute - force attacks , and the third defect means that an attacker can easily break the cryptosystem by approximately estimating the secret key once he has a chance to get access to a fragment of the generated keystream .",
    "it is not clear , at this stage , whether or not intermittent chaos is always unsuitable for designing secure chaotic cryptosystems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , a brief introduction to the secure communication scheme under study",
    "is given . in sec .",
    "[ section : cryptanalysis ] , cryptanalysis is shown in detail along with experimental verification .",
    "the last section concludes the paper .",
    "the secure communication system proposed in @xcite is described as follows .    _",
    "the transmitter system _ is @xmath0 and _ the receiver system _ is @xmath1 where @xmath2 are positive parameters .",
    "the synchronization between these two discrete - time dynamical systems is realized via a common driving signal , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a random telegraph signal ( rts ) given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 is noise introduced by the channel during the transmission of @xmath4 ( note that @xmath6 may be different at the sender and the receiver ends ) . to facilitate the following descriptions , without loss of generality , assume @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "then , a typical value of @xmath9 is @xmath10 , which is the middle value of the interval @xmath11 $ ] , is wrong , since @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , under the assumption that noise @xmath6 has zero - mean and symmetric distribution @xcite , the best value of @xmath9 should naturally be the middle value of @xmath11 $ ] . ] .    in the above secure communication scheme , the rts signal @xmath4 randomly switches the dynamics of the two discrete - time maps ( [ equation : transmittersystem ] ) and ( [ equation : receiversystem ] ) by changing the value of one control parameter , @xmath14 . according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.ii ) , when @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are set to make the two maps chaotic for @xmath18 , increasing @xmath14 will cause the maps to go into the periodic regime . thus , by choosing the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 properly , the two synchronized systems can be configured to work in the chaotic regime for @xmath21 and in the periodic regime for @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "that is , the two maps are not fully chaotic , but _ intermittently chaotic _ , under the control of the random signal @xmath14 . in this case",
    ", the two systems can reach synchronization after a limited number of iterations if @xmath23 is not too large @xcite . according to our experiments",
    ", @xmath24 is required when @xmath25 ( the default values used in @xcite ) .    _",
    "the encryption procedure _ is composed of two processes : the key - generation process and the encryption process .",
    "similarly , _ the decryption procedure _ is composed of the key - generation process and the decryption process .",
    "both procedures can be described as follows .    * _ the key - generation process _ : the transmitter and the receiver generate two pseudo - random keystreams , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . * assuming the plain - signal is @xmath28 and the transmitted cipher - signal is @xmath29 , _ the encryption procedure _ is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a piecewise linear encryption function originally used in @xcite : @xmath32 as mentioned in @xcite , @xmath33 can be replaced by other encryption functions . * assuming the received cipher - signal is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the noise introduced in the transmission channel , and the recovered plain - signal is @xmath36 , _ the decryption procedure _ is @xmath37 .    _",
    "the secret key _ of the key - generation process is @xmath38 and _ the secret key _ of the encryption function ( [ equation : nshiftcipher ] ) is @xmath39 .",
    "_ an enhanced key - generation process _ was also proposed to improve the security of the generated key - stream : use @xmath40 different systems instead of a single one at both ends , and take the maximal value of the outputs of all @xmath41 systems at each time instant to determine @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "before starting to analyze the security of the above - referred secure communication scheme , some security guidelines are reviewed .",
    "following the well - known kerckhoffs principle in cryptology @xcite , the security of a cryptosystem should rely on the secret key only , which means that an attacker knows all details about the cryptosystem except for the secret key .",
    "for this secure communication scheme to be analyzed , the following assumptions are made :    * the attacker does not know the secret keys @xmath38 and @xmath39 . *",
    "the attacker exactly knows eqs .",
    "( [ equation : transmittersystem ] ) to ( [ equation : nshiftcipher ] ) ; * the attacker has full control on the channel over which the cipher - signals @xmath44 and the common driving signals @xmath45 are transmitted , where  full control \" means that the attacker not only can passively observe the transmitted signals but also can actively change the transmitted signals @xmath29 and @xmath4 .",
    "actually , in some special scenarios , it is possible for an attacker to get some useful information or even intentionally choose some information from the transmitter and/or the receiver . as a result , from the cryptographical point of view , to provide a high level of security",
    ", a cryptosystem should be secure enough against all the following four attacks ( listed from the hardest to the easiest ) :    * _ the ciphertext - only attack _ - the attacker can only get ciphertexts and other publicly - transmitted information ( such as the common driving signal in the scheme under discussion ) ; * _ the known - plaintext attack _ - in addition to some basic information , the attacker can get some plaintexts and the corresponding ciphertexts ; * _ the chosen - plaintext attack _ - in addition to some basic information , the attacker can choose some plaintexts and get the corresponding ciphertexts ; * _ the chosen - ciphertext attack _ - in addition to some basic information , the attacker can choose some ciphertexts and get the corresponding plaintexts .",
    "the last two attacks , which seem to seldom occur in practice , are feasible in some real applications ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1 ) and has become much more common in today s networked world . in the following ,",
    "it will be pointed out that the secure communication system under study is not secure enough against the first three attacks .",
    "this paper imposes a simple assumption , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , to make the discussion of cryptanalysis easier .",
    "note that removing the two noise signals has no influence on the security analysis of the studied scheme .",
    "also , @xmath6 and @xmath35 can be directly removed in some applications , for example , when the whole system is constructed digitally in computers and the transmission channels are digital storage media ( such as floppy disks , hard disks , cds , flash - memory disks , etc . ) or networks completely digitized with some error - correction mechanisms .",
    "in addition , one generally simulates secure communication schemes via some mathematical softwares , such as matlab@xmath48 , where no channel errors occur .",
    "the simplest attack to a cryptosystem is known as the brute - force attack consisting of exhaustively searching all possible keys .",
    "the complexity of such a simple attack is determined by the size of the key space , i.e. , the number of all valid keys . from the cryptographical point of view",
    ", the size of the key space should not be smaller than @xmath49 to provide a high level of security @xcite . in this section",
    ", it is to point out that the studied communication system is not secure enough since its key space is not sufficiently large , which is caused by the key space reduction and low sensitivity of decryption to the secret key .",
    "the secret key of the key - generation process @xmath38 can be immediately reduced to @xmath50 by rewriting the chaotic equation as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 in addition , as stated in @xcite , this secure communication scheme is not sensitive to @xmath9 .",
    "actually , @xmath9 depends only on the distribution of the noise signal @xmath6 and under most conditions @xmath53 can work well .",
    "therefore , from the cryptographical point of view , @xmath9 should not be included in the secret key .",
    "thus , the secret key of the key - generation process is reduced to @xmath54 .",
    "the secret key of the encryption function ( [ equation : nshiftcipher ] ) was claimed to be @xmath39 in @xcite .",
    "since the range of the cipher - signal @xmath29 is @xmath55 $ ] , one can set @xmath56 be the maximum of @xmath57 in a long period of time .",
    "this means that @xmath56 can be removed and the secret key is further reduced to @xmath58 only .    in the following",
    ", only @xmath59 will be used as the secret parameters of the secure communication scheme for further analysis .      in @xcite ,",
    "some experiments were reported to show that the secure communication scheme is very sensitive to parameter mismatch : even a small difference of order @xmath60 in @xmath15 , @xmath61 or @xmath62 will cause a relatively large decryption error ( see fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) .",
    "assuming such a sensitivity holds equally for all the four secret parameters @xmath54 , one can see that the size of the key space of the key - generation process will not be less than @xmath63 , which is cryptographically large .",
    "however , our numerical study shows that the data given in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite are wrong , so they reached a false conclusion on the sensitivity to the secret key in decryption .",
    "in fact , we found that the sensitivity is mainly dependent on the values of @xmath23 and @xmath64 , and that this sensitivity is too weak to provide a high level of security when @xmath64 is not too large ( @xmath64 has to be as large as @xmath65 as discussed below ) .    at first , let us revisit the case experimentally studied in sec .",
    "iii - c of @xcite , where the key shown in the caption of fig .",
    "5 of @xcite should be 1.0 , not 5.0 .",

    ", we assume that the plain - signal is sampled at a frequency of 100 hz .",
    "when the decryption key is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the relative parameter mismatch may be very small in practice , the relative mismatch is more suitable for analysis than its absolute counterpart .",
    "] , the decrypted plain - signal @xmath36 and its spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : mt_mt2_sint_3 ] ( for comparison , the waveform and spectrum of @xmath28 are also plotted ) .",
    "one can see that the plain - signal is decrypted with only a little intermittent noise , which means that the sensitivity of the encryption scheme to the parameter mismatch is very weak .",
    "further experiments show that with a larger @xmath72 it is still possible to approximately recover the plain - signal @xmath28 , at least in the frequency domain ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : mt_mt2_sint_0 ] for the decryption plain - signal @xmath36 when @xmath73 ) .",
    "what does @xmath73 mean ?",
    "it means that even a secret key satisfying @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be used to approximately recover the sinusoidal signal . to observe the relationship between the recovery errors and the value of @xmath72 , defining the decryption error ratio ( in power energy ) as @xmath78 , 17 different values of @xmath72",

    "[ figure : per_delta ] .",
    "the results imply that any key satisfying @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be used to approximately recover the sinusoidal signal . roughly speaking",
    ", the closer the key to the real key , the smaller the recovery errors will incline to be .",
    "clearly , this will cause fatal collapse of the key space and so dramatically reduce the security of the scheme .",
    "thus , one question arises : how can one explain such an undesirable insensitivity ?     and the decrypted signal @xmath36 , and their relative power spectra , when @xmath71 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . ]     and its relative power spectrum , when @xmath69 , @xmath73 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . ]    , when @xmath83 and @xmath84 . _",
    "_ ]    in our opinion , the reason behind this interesting phenomenon should be attributed to the fact that the involved dynamical systems show chaotic behaviors with a probability less than @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath85 , the periodic behavior will dominate the evolution of @xmath86 , therefore @xmath86 will not be so sensitive to parameter mismatch in an average sense , as expected in a fully chaotic regime .",
    "observing the difference between @xmath43 and @xmath42 , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : kt12_3 ] , the above explanation can be understood conceptually .",
    "( top ) and @xmath87 ( bottom ) , when @xmath71 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . ]",
    "next , let us find out how the sensitivity changes as @xmath23 increases . following the above qualitative explanation on the low sensitivity of the decryption error for @xmath83 , it can be expected that the chaotic behavior occurs more and more frequently as @xmath23 increases , so that the decryption error will become more and more sensitive to parameter mismatch .",
    "taking @xmath88 as an example , experiments show that the decryption error when @xmath71 is similar to the case when @xmath83 and @xmath73 ( see figs .",
    "[ figure : mt_mt2_sint_3_p7 ] and [ figure : kt12_3_p7 ] for the experimental results and compare them with figs .",

    "it is clear that even for the maximal value of @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath90 , the sensitivity of the decryption error to parameter mismatch is not sufficiently high .",
    "to avoid such an insensitivity , one has to ensure the dynamical system evolves in the chaotic regime in all time , i.e. , to set @xmath91 .",
    "however , in this case the synchronization will become absolutely impossible @xcite .",
    "this seems to imply that the proposed secure communication scheme based on intermittent chaos is _ always _ insecure from the cryptographical point of view @xcite .",

    "[ figure : kt12_3 ] and [ figure : kt12_3_p7 ] is that the difference between @xmath43 and @xmath42 is significantly magnified by the encryption function ( [ equation : nshiftcipher ] ) . by rewriting the @xmath64-fold encryption function as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 one can easily find that such a magnification is mainly determined by the multiplication factor @xmath64 : the larger the @xmath64 is ,",
    "the larger the magnification will be .",
    "this suggests that the sensitivity of @xmath86 is improved by using a larger value of @xmath64 .",
    "however , @xmath64 has to be very large to increase the sensitivity to an acceptable level of security since the magnification spreading rate here is linear .",
    "for example , when @xmath83 , to make the actual sensitivity be in the order of @xmath60 , as reported in @xcite , @xmath99 is required . figs .",

    "this result actually implies :    * the decryption is largely insensitive not only to the mismatch of the secret key of the key - generation process , but also to the secret key of the encryption function ( [ equation : nshiftcipher ] ) , so brute - force attacks to the whole chaotic cryptosystem are quite easy . *",

    "this implies that _ the breaking of the secret parameters from a fragment of @xmath86 is always possible , independent of the sensitivity of @xmath86 to the parameter mismatch_. in other words , _ the key - generation process is always insecure against known / chosen - plaintext attacks_. one can see that this result agrees with the similar result obtained in the last subsection  _ the security of the studied secure communication scheme is ensured by the encryption function @xmath33 ( not by the chaos - based key - generation process)_. once again , it discourages the use of intermittent chaos in cryptography .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the security of the enhanced key - generation process proposed in @xcite against known / chosen - plaintext attacks .",
    "assume @xmath154 different dynamical systems are used to generate the keystream @xmath86 : @xmath155 , where @xmath156 apparently , in the enhanced key - generation process , the number of secret parameters will increase to be @xmath157 and the return map will be distorted to some extent .",
    "unfortunately , it is found that such an enhancement is not as secure as expected against return - map - based attacks . as an example , let @xmath158 and the parameters be @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the return map from 10,000 samples is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure : returnmap_enhancedscheme]a . compared with fig .",
    "[ figure : returnmap]a , although one can not find the shape of all the 8 branches corresponding to 8 different equations , two of them can still be clearly seen , as shown by dot - dashed lines ( which are local edges of the return map ) .",
    "two exposed branches belong to the first dynamical sub - system : @xmath163 and @xmath164 . using the method discussed above",
    ", one can easily get an estimation of the 4 secret parameters @xmath165 .",
    "this method can be further generalized to break even more parameters : the several dots marked by the arrow actually expose another branch , @xmath166 , which belongs to the second sub - system and is shown by a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ figure : returnmap_enhancedscheme]a .",
    "since no point is available near the @xmath124-intercept of this branch , the simple estimation method is disabled , but numerical algorithms can still be used to get the values of @xmath167 by using only three different points .",
    "now , about half of the secret parameters are broken with the return - map - based cryptanalysis .",
    "although it seems very difficult to break other secret parameters in a similar way , the breaking of partial parameters still reduces the security of the enhanced key - generation process quite significantly .        to frustrate the above partial attack , one may change @xmath155 to other functions . in fig .",
    "[ figure : returnmap_enhancedscheme]b , the return map corresponding to the mean function @xmath168 is shown .",
    "it can be seen that the return map is further distorted and the edges become much more ambiguous . however , there are still some visible curves ( marked with arrows ) hidden in the noise - like return map .",
    "it is not clear whether or not these visible curves can be used to break some secret parameters . from a conservative point of view",
    ", the risk always exists , so a good mixing function has to be found to remove any visible information in the @xmath169 return map .",
    "we have tested many simple functions and their combinations , and found that it really is a difficult task .",
    "considering the non - uniform distribution of @xmath86 over the defining interval ( see fig . 3 of @xcite )",
    ", it is guessed that only iterative chaotic maps with a good mixing property @xcite can smooth the distribution of @xmath86 and then effectively remove the visible curves . in fig .",
    "[ figure : returnmap_enhancedscheme]c , the 24-fold skew - tent map is used to generate the keystream : @xmath170 , where @xmath171 one can see that the resulting return map becomes much more mixed .",
    "although in such a way the key - generation process can be dramatically enhanced , _",
    "the enhancement is caused by the fully - chaotic tent map @xmath172 with a good mixing feature , not by the two intermittent chaotic systems themselves_. this , for the third time , makes the use of intermittent chaos in cryptography questionable .",
    "this paper has carefully studied the security of a secure communication scheme published in @xcite , which is based on intermittent chaotic systems driven by a common random signal .",
    "it is found that the key space of the studied scheme can be drastically reduced , and that the decryption is insensitive to the mismatch of the secret key , which means that the scheme can be easily broken by inexpensive brute - force attacks .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the core of this secure communication scheme  the key - generation process ",
    "is not secure against known / chosen - plaintext attacks : if an attacker can get access to a fragment of the generated keystream , he can easily estimate the secret key with sufficient accuracy and thus break the entire cryptosystem .",
    "the security of an enhanced key - generation process proposed in @xcite has also been discussed . at present , it is still not clear whether or not the existence of periodic regimes in intermittent chaotic systems always brings negative influence on the design of secure chaotic cryptosystems .",
