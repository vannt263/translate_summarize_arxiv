    "understanding the assembly history of massive spheroidal galaxies is a key issue for galaxy formation models .",

    "the possibility of mergers of evolved sub - units ( `` dry mergers '' ) has been introduced ( van dokkum et al . 2005 ; faber et al .",

    "the heart of the problem are the masses of the objects : a large fraction of present day massive galaxies already assembled at @xmath13 would be extremely challenging for the standard view of a merging - driven growth . measurements of clustering amplitudes are a unique tool to estimate halo masses at high @xmath14 , but complete samples comprising at least several hundreds of sources are necessary .",

    ". however , redshift estimates can be obtained from photometric data , taking advantage of the spitzer infrared array camera ( irac ) survey which covers an extensive portion of the mips field ( lacy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the main irac survey has covered an area of 3.8 square degrees in the four channels centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath23 m , reaching a @xmath39% completeness level respectively at @xmath40 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42jy ( fig .",

    "investigations of the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of prototype sources such as m  82 , arp  220 , and mkn  231 ( the latter with mid - ir luminosity probably powered by the presence of an agn ) shows that the tightest constraints on the redshifts of very distant galaxies with intense star - formation come from the 8@xmath44 m irac channel , since such sources are expected to be very weak at shorter wavelengths ( see also yan et al .",
    "therefore , in the following we will only consider data from the 8@xmath2 m channel .",
    "we have looked for the 8@xmath2 m counterparts to mips sources over the 2.85 square degrees region @xmath45 ra(2000 ) @xmath46 and 58.6@xmath47 dec @xmath48 , for which both 8@xmath23 m and @xmath35-band observations are available . in this area",

    "we identified as the counterpart to a mips source the irac source with a positional separation less than a suitably chosen radius .",
    "as mentioned in  2.1 , the positional accuracies for both mips and irac sources with @xmath49 is @xmath50 , so that we expect a rms positional difference due to astrometric errors of @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the irac astrometry is based on 2mass , while that of the 24@xmath23 m sources is related to sdss .",
    "although both systems are very accurate , a small systematic offset may be present .    tackling the problem from a more pragmatic point of view , we considered the distribution of the residuals @xmath52 , @xmath53 between the positions of all 24@xmath23 m and 8@xmath23 m pairs with separations @xmath54 and @xmath55 less than @xmath56",
    ". the distribution of residuals shows a strong concentration of points near @xmath57 and @xmath58 arcsec , values which can be taken as the mean positional offsets between the 24@xmath23 m and 8@xmath23 m reference frames .",

    "in fact , indications that optically faint _ spitzer _ sources with @xmath305mjy are agn dominated have been reported ( houck et al . 2005 ; weedman et al .",
    "2006 ) . comparing the redshift dependencies of the @xmath306 flux ratios corresponding to the seds of well - known galaxies such as arp  220 ( starburst galaxy ) and of mkn  231 ( obscured agn ) we find that , over the redshift range of interest here , starburst galaxies are expected to have @xmath307 and agn - dominated sources @xmath308 . adopting this criterion",
    ", we find that in our sample the latter sources dominate for @xmath309mjy , while starburst galaxies prevail at fainter fluxes comprising @xmath310 of the sample .",
    "no significant difference in the clustering properties of the two sub - populations was detected .",
    "our optically faint sources that , as argued above , are most likely at @xmath292 , comprise @xmath311 of the complete @xmath277mjy sample .",
    "this fraction is remarkably close to the prediction by silva et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2005 ) .",
    "these authors pointed out that the physically grounded evolutionary model for massive spheroidal galaxies by granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) implies that the active star - forming phase of these objects had to show up in @xmath7 m mips surveys and estimated that they constitute @xmath31210% of all sources brighter than @xmath313mjy and cover the redshift range 1.52.6 ( with a tail extending up to @xmath261 ; cfr . figure  27 of silva et al . 2004 ) . at the flux limit ( @xmath314jy ) of the @xmath7 m mips survey of the chandra deep field south ,",
    "the model predicts a surface density of @xmath315 for sources at @xmath316 ( @xmath317 of the total surface density of sources brighter than that flux limit ) , in nice agreement with the observational determinations by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and caputi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , yielding fractions of 24% and 28% ( corresponding to surface densities of @xmath318@xmath319 .",
    "the photometric ( radio , sub - mm , mid - ir , optical ) properties of our sources are all consistent with their interpretation in terms of massive star - forming proto - spheroidal galaxies . the granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model features a tight connection between star - formation activity and growth of the active nucleus hosted by the galaxy .",
    "it thus naturally accounts for the indications of a dominant agn contribution for @xmath320mjy .",
    "according to this model , most sources have high , but not extreme , star - formation rates ( sfrs ) , @xmath287 , well below the peak sfr reached during their evolution .",
    "this is because during the most active star - forming phases the optical depth of the interstellar medium is very high even at rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath304 m .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 m selection preferentially singles out sources in the phase when the effect of feedbacks has begun to damp the sfr , at the same time substantially decreasing the optical depth . in this phase , the active nucleus is approaching its maximum luminosity and shows up , for a short time , at the brightest flux levels , as is indeed observed .",
    "the median galactic halo mass , estimated from the model , is @xmath288 , sensibly lower than that accounting for the clustering properties .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the lifetime of the starburst phase of these haloes is shorter ( by a factor @xmath321 ) than the hubble time , so that starburst galaxies work as beacons signalling the presence of larger haloes , typically hosting @xmath321 galactic haloes with @xmath288 , out of which only one is bright enough at @xmath7 m to meet the observational selection .",
    "once we account for this lifetime effect , the comoving density of proto - spheroidal galaxies at @xmath322 matches that of @xmath288 haloes in the same epoch , and is substantially higher than what predicted by most semi - analytic models for galaxy formation .",
