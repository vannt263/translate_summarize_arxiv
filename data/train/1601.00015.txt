    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a powerful framework based on exploiting symmetries and controlled expansions for problems with a natural separation of energy or distance scales .",
    "efts are particularly important in qcd and nuclear physics .",
    "an effective theory of qcd , ideally suited to jet applications , is soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "recently , first steps were taken to extend scet and describe jet evolution in strongly - interacting matter  @xcite by introducing a transverse momentum exchange glauber gluon mode between the collinear partons and the medium quasi - particles .",
    "the newly constructed theory , called soft - collinear effective theory with glauber gluons ( @xmath2 ) , was used to derive all @xmath7 @xmath8 medium - induced splitting kernels and discuss higher order @xmath9 corrections to the medium - modified jet substructure  @xcite .",
    "these medium - induced splitting kernel are the universal key ingredients in the evaluation of a wide variety of hadronic and jet observables in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the theoretical advances reported here allowed us for the first time to go beyond the traditional energy loss approximation to parton propagation in matter and to unify the treatment of vacuum and medium - induced parton showers  @xcite .",
    "they provide quantitative control over the uncertainties associated with the implementation of the in - medium modification of hadron production cross sections and help accurately constrain the coupling between the jet and the medium .",
    "elementary parton branching is the essential steps in the formation of a parton shower .",
    "it was demonstrated that in the ambiance of dense qcd matter full splitting functions are equal to the sum of the vacuum ones and the corresponding in - medium contribution : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the momentum fraction carried by the daughter parton , @xmath12 is the transverse momentum relative to the parent parton , and @xmath13 collectively describes the medium properties .",
    "the splitting functions factorize from the hard scattering process and are gauge invariant .",
    "they govern the evolution of parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) in the medium . here , we are interested in final - state interactions and the generalized dglap evolution equations for ffs in the medium are written down as follows  @xcite @xmath14\\ , , \\label{eq : map10 } \\\\",

    "at leading order , the jet energy function associated with parton @xmath21 with the collinear momentum @xmath22 splitting into @xmath23 and @xmath24 can then be written as follows , @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the collinear parton splitting functions . here , @xmath27 is the measurement function associated with the jet energy function . since the splitting functions are directs sums of their vacuum and medium - induced components eq .",
