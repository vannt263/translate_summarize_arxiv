    "<S> in a recent inelastic neutron scattering experiment in the pseudogap state of the high temperature superconductor @xmath0 an unusual ` vertical ' dispersion of the spin excitations with a large in - plane anisotropy was observed . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the spin susceptibility of the singlet @xmath1-density wave , the triplet @xmath1-density wave , as well as the more common spin density wave orders with hopping anisotropies . from numerical calculations within the framework of random phase approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we find nearly vertical dispersion relations for spin excitations with anisotropic incommensurability at low energy @xmath2 , which are reminiscent of the experiments . at very high energy @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we also find energy - dependent incommensurability . </S>",
    "<S> although there are some important difference between the three cases , unpolarized neutron measurements can not discriminate between these alternate possibilities ; the vertical dispersion , however , is a distinct feature of all three density wave states in contrast to the superconducting state , which shows an hour - glass shape dispersion . </S>"
