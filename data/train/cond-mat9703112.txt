    "anderson localization @xcite can be also studied in quasiperiodic systems via the harper s equation , which also describes electrons in a square lattice with an added strong magnetic field @xcite , superconducting networks @xcite , etc .",
    "this model presents a very useful alternative to the study of one  dimensional ( @xmath2 ) disordered systems , since apart from localization it can also display metallic behavior associated with ballistic motion and critical behavior ( mobility edge ) with ordinary diffusion @xcite , somehow mimicing more realistic three  dimensional ( @xmath3 ) disordered systems . in this paper",
    "we report results which relate to the problem of what happens to the electronic eigenstates and the corresponding quantum dynamics of two electrons moving in a quasiperiodic potential in which the interaction between them is taken into account .",
    "the study of two hubbard interacting particles ( thip ) localized by a random potential has been pioneered by shepelyansky @xcite .",
    "this author and also @xcite produced very interesting analytical and numerical work within the anderson - hubbard model , which showed weakening of anderson localization , which is known always to be caused by disorder in @xmath2 , due to the effect of the two particle interaction .",
    "this lead to an enhanced propagation effect of the interacting electron pair on scales larger than the single  particle localization length .",
    "the phenomenon of propagation enhancement due to the interaction was also displayed in disordered mesoscopic rings threaded by magnetic flux by showing a pairing effect via a few @xmath4periodic , instead of @xmath5periodic , eigenstates @xcite .",
    "however , a previous diagonalization study for @xmath2 disordered system @xcite revealed that a few states in the main band show a weak propagation enhancement while states with two locally paired electrons are , usually , even more localized in the presence of the interaction .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out that for large positive @xmath0 stronger localization occurs when compared to the non  interacting case . in a recent work @xcite , it is clearly demonstrated by a tranfer matrix study that no propagation enhancement is possible for thip in an infinite disordered chain at @xmath6 .",
    "these , rather conflicting results can be partially understood by the fact that most works , apart from the direct exact diagonalization or dynamical approaches , rely on a mapping of the thip problem to a superimposed banded random matrix ensemble ( sbrme ) .",
    "it was suggested that if the interaction is expressed in the non  interacting localized basis a random band matrix with additional disorder in the matrix diagonal appears ( sbrme ) and the enhancement of the pair localization length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the one  particle localization length , is easily obtained @xcite .",
    "however , the reduction to a sbrme relies on a questionable assumption about chaoticity of the non  interacting localized states within @xmath8 , so that the relevant matrix model could be probably different @xcite .",
    "moreover , since in the one  particle localized basis the interaction is relevant only when the two particles are localized around positions close to each other , the obtained localization weakening might vanish for an infinite chain @xcite .",
    "it must be also pointed out that since in most of the previous works only the localized case with finite @xmath8 is considered it could be reasonable to expect more dramatic pairing effects for extended non  interacting eigenstates which are always overlapping .",
    "the model considered in this paper allows to study the fate of extended and critical one  electron states in the presence of hubbard interaction .",
    "we find a kind of pairing effect for the two particle states in the metallic and the critical regimes with the simultaneous appearance of localized pairing states in the gaps and the created subband due to the interaction @xcite .",
    "these localized states reduce the corresponding thip dynamics although it remains similar in nature to the non  interacting case in all three regimes .",
    "however , we obtain a weak enhancement of propagation in the localized regime when the interaction is switched on , as in disordered systems , but even stronger localization is shown to occur for larger @xmath0 .    in sections ii ,",
    "iii we introduce the harper - hubbard model and consider by diagonalization methods two interacting electrons moving in a tight binding quasiperiodic potential of strength @xmath9 , for various values of the local electron ",

    "it is known @xcite that there are extended states for @xmath10 , a mobility edge for @xmath11 and a finite one ",
    "electron localization length @xmath12 independent of energy for @xmath13 . in section",
    "iv we present our results from the numerical diagonalization of the corresponding two interacting electrons harper  hubbard equation , by showing explicitly extended pairing states in the metallic case @xmath10 or multifractal pairing states at the mobility edge @xmath14 .",
    "we do not find extended or multifractal pairing states for the insulator but a weak propagation enhancement with the simultaneous appearance of localized pairing states @xcite . in section",
    "v we address the question of the electron localization dynamics in the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "the time evolution of a quantum wave packet in the presence of interactions shows ballistic motion for @xmath15 , diffusion for @xmath16 and ceases to expand for @xmath13 as for the non  interacting metallic , critical and localized regimes , respectively @xcite . in the presence of the interaction a decreasing @xmath0dependent electron velocity and diffusion coefficient due to the appearance of localized states",
    "is obtained for the metallic and the critical regimes , respectively . in the localized regime",
    "larger localization length is found for small @xmath0 although for higher @xmath0 stronger localization occurs , in agreement with previous results on the anderson - hubbard model @xcite . finally , in section vi we discuss our results and present the conclusions which arise from the present study",
    "the harper - hubbard tight binding equation for two interacting particles is @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the creation and destruction operators for the electron at site @xmath20 with spin @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the potential at site @xmath20 , with @xmath23 an irrational number usually chosen as the golden mean @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath0 is the strength of the local hubbard interaction between the two electrons .",
    "the hilbert space can be conveniently divided into one singlet subspace with total spin @xmath25 and three triplet subspaces with total spin @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the three triplet subspaces are energy degenerate and since they permit no double occupation the triplet states are not affected by the hubbard interaction . in a chain of @xmath28 sites",
    "the singlet subspace is spaned in the basis of @xmath29 spatially symmetric wave functions @xmath30 which are antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the spins and permit double occupancy .",
    "we carried out exact diagonalization of @xmath31 in the singlet subspace where the hubbard interaction is relevant and found out all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for finite @xmath28 sites with various @xmath9 s and @xmath0 s . in order to measure the degree of localization for the interacting electrons we calculate the one  particle spatial extent @xmath32 in the @xmath33th two",
    " electron wave function via @xcite @xmath34 with mean positions @xmath35 of the electrons @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the normalized coefficient of the wave function in the basis of eq .",
    "( [ bas ] ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that in the way @xmath39 is defined it can estimate the spatial extend of each electron averaged over the second electron and is related to a quantity known as the participation ratio @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 should correspond to the true localization length if the wave functions decay exponentially .",
    "another important quantity used in this study is the mean value of the distance between the two electrons in the chain which can be calculated for each two  particle wave function via @xmath40 the distance @xmath41 measures the correlation between the two electrons so that a small @xmath42 defines a pairing two  electron eigenstate , which can be either delocalized in the metallic regime , multifractal in the critical regime or localized mostly in the insulating regime @xmath13 .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix for fibonacci number chain lengths @xmath28 , e.g. @xmath43 if the rational approximant of @xmath44 is @xmath45 , so that the potential is periodic with period @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we plot @xmath46 and @xmath42 versus the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath47 for the @xmath2 pure @xmath48 case with interaction @xmath49 .",
    "the striking characteristic is a band of @xmath28 states , out of the total of @xmath50 two  particle states , which have extremely small distance @xmath42 starting from the energy @xmath1 where @xmath42 is presisely zero ( see fig .",
    "these pairing states have one sharp peak at the diagonal line of the plane where @xmath51 which implies that the particles always stay very close to each other . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) we plot some characteristic such wave function amplitudes in the plane of the two  electron coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 where the non  zero amplitudes appear in or very close to the diagonal line",
    ".    extended pairing states due to the interaction but having a finite width @xmath42 are also seen in fig . 2 for the ballistic case @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "these states are identified from fig .",
    "2(a ) by plotting in fig .",
    "2(b ) , ( c ) only some states which have small @xmath42 .",
    "the extended pairing states in the metallic regime ( @xmath10 ) have their number progressively reduced when increasing @xmath9 towards @xmath56 .",
    "3(a ) accounts for the critical case @xmath16 where still a few pairing states are seen , such as in fig .",
    "3(b ) , with a displayed kind of multifractality along the diagonal @xcite .",
    "however , apart from extended or multifractal pairing states we also obtain another kind of localized pairing states which occur in pairs of almost identical energies and similar amplitude distributions . in fig .",
    "3(c ) one such state is shown where a double peaked structure is displayed along the diagonal having small @xmath42 and misleadingly large @xmath46 due to our definition of @xmath46 , since such pairing states are strongly localized in two spatial positions along the diagonal .",
    "the localized pairing states correspond to a physical picture of localization due to mott @xcite and they are more frequently encountered in the insulating @xmath57 regime .",
    "they involve tunneling transitions between the two particle localized states spaced at a distance proportional to @xmath8 apart , having energies that differ by very small amounts . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we demonstrate @xmath46 and @xmath42 in the critical regime @xmath14 with a higher value of the interaction strength @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , ( c )",
    "we show two multifractal pairing states . in the plot of fig .",
    "5 we show @xmath46 and @xmath42 for the insulating regime @xmath59 with localized pairing states having two maxima ( fig .",
    "5(b ) , ( c ) ) and no extended or multifractal pairing states survive in this case .",
    "we find that localized two  particle states due to the interaction also appear in the metallic and the critical regimes .",
    "these pairing states have small @xmath42 and are located either in the gaps or in the subband created by the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "they are identified from fig .",

    "the localized pairing states due to the effect of the interaction @xmath0 are clearly seen .",
    "it must be emphasised that localized pairing states are found for @xmath10 only in the presence of finite interaction ( @xmath60 ) and the results described in this section did not change qualitatively by varying the system size .",
    "the study of the wave packet dynamics provides a global information for the changes due to the interaction of all the relevant wave functions .",
    "if we put two electrons at the same initial site , e.g. the chain center @xmath61 at @xmath62 , the mean square displacement @xmath63 for each electron at subsequent times @xmath64 can be calculated from all the singlet eigensolutions of eq .",
    "( 1 ) from the variance @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes quantum average and the factor of @xmath37 in the denominator transforms @xmath67 to correspond to one electron , in order to agree with previous one  electron dynamics for @xmath68 . for the adopted initial condition , in which the two electrons are at the same site , only the singlet states with additional on  site energy due to @xmath0 are allowed .",
    "alternatively , we have integrated the corresponding two  dimensional equations of motion using a runge - kutta algorithm , in order to obtain results for much longer chains of @xmath69 .",
    "7(a ) shows the obtained @xmath63 for @xmath70 where is seen that the ballistic motion @xmath71 , remains valid also for finite @xmath0 but with a reduced velocity .",
    "in the critical case @xmath14 diffusion with @xmath72 is obtained in fig .",
    "7(b ) reducing in magnitude by increasing @xmath0 , although a tendency for more enhanced propagation is seen when @xmath58 . for the insulator in fig .",
    "7(c ) @xmath63 shows many oscillations and asymptotically reaches larger values for finite @xmath73 when compared to @xmath68 , which indicates the familiar weakening of localization due to the interaction @xcite .",
    "however , for very large @xmath74 the relevant wave functions for the dynamical process lie mostly in the subband created above the main band , which corresponds to localized pairing states having much shorter localization lengths , and as a result the mean square displacement becomes very short ( fig .",
    "7(c ) ) indicating a localizing effect of the interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , a decrease of the degree of localization due to the interaction is demonstrated in the localized regime for not too large @xmath0 , in agreement with the original reported tendency .",
    "it must be mentioned that our definition of eq .",
    "( 6 ) focuses on the properties of one interacting electron and is different from both @xmath75 and @xmath76 introduced @xcite to examine coherent propagation of two electrons .",
    "our results diplayed in fig .",
    "8 for the metallic , critical and the localized cases show a similar behavior of the electron ( @xmath77 ) and pair ( @xmath78 ) propagation as well as for the squared pair size ( @xmath79 ) . from these results since the obtained propagation behavior in the diagonal and its vertical are similar no coherent pair propagation can be concluded although a kind of weak pairing can be seen for the metal and the insulator where @xmath80 but no such effect at the critical point where @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , in the insulating regime for @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "8(c ) ) we note that @xmath77 is below @xmath78 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the interacting electron problem in the periodic @xmath82 case can be mapped onto an equation for a single electron moving in a two dimensional lattice with a line of impurities of energy @xmath0 along the diagonal . the impurities naturally lead to @xmath28 resonance states at energies starting from @xmath1 as seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , having amplitude only on the impurity sites along the lattice diagonal . in this way",
    "extended pairing states naturally appear , for example , precisely at @xmath1 a two  particle pairing state can be found exactly ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) having a constant amplitude on the diagonal and zero elsewhere .",
    "it is very well known that such resonance extended states can also appear at certain energies in non  interacting @xmath2 chains with distributed large segments of identical impurities @xcite .",
    "the quasiperiodicity in addition to the interaction also permits such an exact mapping to a single electron equation moving in a two dimensional lattice with a symmetric potential @xmath83 at the coordinate @xmath84 , which denote the positions of the two electrons , in addition to the line of impurities @xmath85 along the diagonal .",
    "in analogy with the one  dimensional large impurity case where additional small perturbations are known to allow the survival of a weak resonant effect at certain energies , remnant of the extended states in the absence of perturbation @xcite , we similarly obtain a kind of pairing states having finite but small distance between the two electrons . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate by exact diagonalization of the thip hamiltonian in a finite quasiperiodic harper s chain such two  particle extended or multifractal pairing states due to the interaction for the metal and at the critical point . in these regimes",
    "we also find localized pairing states due to the interaction in the gaps or the created subband , also according to the mott resonance theory of localization . in the localized regime @xmath57",
    "we find mostly localized pairing states with short localization lengths .    in disordered systems",
    "previous attempts to consider the electron - electron interactions are based on perturbation theories @xcite or more rigorous solutions for special cases @xcite . in this paper by a numerical diagonalization study the interaction between two electrons a novel pairing effect for certain delocalized states is found which occurs via extended or multifractal pairing states .",
    "localized pairing states are also found due to the interaction in all regimes @xcite .",
    "our results are confirmed for both repulsive and attractive on - site hubbard interactions and is probably worth noting that in the case of an attractive interaction ( @xmath0 negative ) the subband created by the interaction lies below the band bottom of the non - interacting case so that the ground state is always a localized pairing state for the metal and the insulator .",
    "the localized pairing states might also affect physical quantities since they can decrease the velocity and the diffusion coefficient in the metalic and the critical regimes .",
    "moreover , in the corresponding dynamics we demonstrate a tendency for weakening of localization in the insulating @xmath13 regime for small @xmath0 but even stronger localization for higher @xmath0 .",
