    "recently phenomena involving interactions of hadrons in small - size configurations have been intensively discussed both in relation with the phenomenon of color transparency and vector meson electroproduction observed at hera energies .",
    "there is also a deep relation between presence of the weakly interacting small size configurations in hadrons and phenomenon of cross section fluctuations in the interactions of the hadrons which manifests itself in the inelastic coherent diffraction processes : @xmath3 , see ref.@xcite . in this paper , we focus on the systematic derivation of the formulae for the interaction of the color singlet @xmath4 pair having a small transverse size with a hadron target .",
    "then , we use these formulae to calculate the probability of the distribution for the interaction of a photon and a pion with a target for small interaction cross sections .",
    "although some of equations deduced in the paper existed before no derivations with analysis of their accuracy has been presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we consider the virtual forward compton amplitude in the small-@xmath5 region where it is dominated by the photon - gluon scattering subprocess .",
    "we outline there a derivation of the basic formula expressing the total cross section @xmath6 as a convolution of the gluon distribution amplitude @xmath7 and the @xmath8 scattering cross section . in section 3 , we write down the @xmath8 cross section in terms of the @xmath9 light - cone wave functions of the virtual photons . in the next section ,",
    "we calculate the cross section distribution @xmath10 for the virtual photon . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the quark - hadron duality interplay between the perturbative free - quark results and contributions due to low - lying resonances . finally , in section 6",
    ", we calculate the cross section distribution for the pion @xmath11 in the small cross section limit where it is governed by @xmath9 configurations having small spatial size .",
    "basing on qcd evolution equation we evaluate also the functional dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath0 and on the incident energy .",
    "let us consider a particular contribution into the @xmath13 cross section corresponding to a transformation of the virtual photon when @xmath14 converts into a @xmath15 pair with quarks having a large relative transverse momentum .",
    "usually , this contribution is written as a convolution of the infinite momentum frame wave function of the target with the pqcd calculable coefficient function describing the short - distance propagation of the particles between two virtual photon vertices .",
    "our aim is to express the relevant coefficient function in terms of the light - cone wave functions of the virtual photons as viewed from the reference frame where the target is at rest .",
    "the contribution we are interested in is given by the sum of diagrams shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the lower blob corresponds to the gluon distribution in the target .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the gluon momentum @xmath16 in terms of the sudakov variables @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are light - like momenta related to @xmath20 by @xmath21 @xmath22 for our goals , the most interesting region is that of small values of the bjorken parameter : @xmath23 , where we may safely approximate @xmath24 .    in the @xmath25 integral , the region @xmath26 corresponds to the next - order @xmath27 correction , so we will take into account only the contribution of the region @xmath28",
    ". this corresponds to the leading @xmath29 approximation in which the @xmath30 corrections are neglected . in this kinematical region ,",
    "the contribution of the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 can be considerably simplified .",
    "the essential region of integration is @xmath31 note that @xmath32 of the @xmath33 state produced by @xmath14 .",
    "hence , @xmath34 is the essential region of integration over @xmath35 .",
    "it is convenient to write the propagator @xmath36 of the exchanged gluon in the light - cone gauge @xmath37 , in which @xmath38 it can be shown ( @xmath39 @xcite ) that in our case the @xmath40 part of the propagator dominates . using eq.([eq:1.5 ] ) , the dominant part of the gluon propagator can be further simplified : @xmath41    in other words , it is sufficient to take into account only the longitudinal polarization of the exchanged gluons .",
    "indeed , let us estimate the contribution due to exchange of a transversely polarized gluon : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the imaginary part of the amplitude of the @xmath14 scattering off a gluon given by the lowest - order feynman diagrams and @xmath44 is that for the gluon scattering off a target @xmath45 .",
    "using the fact that , at high energies , the feynman amplitude of processes due to exchange by two elementary fermions tends to constant @xcite we obtain : @xmath46 in this estimate we use also scaling over @xmath47 in the box diagram .",
    "the amplitude due to the exchange by two vector particles increases like @xmath48 , and we have @xmath49 here @xmath50 , since , according to the qcd evolution equations , the deep inelastic amplitudes increase with energy in region of applicability of the perturbative qcd .    as a result of this power counting estimate",
    "we obtain : @xmath51 here , we substituted @xmath52 . thus ,",
    "due to the presence of the factor @xmath35 in eq.([eq:1.8 ] ) , in the leading @xmath53 approximation , the contribution due to the exchange of a transversely polarized gluon is negligible compared to the contribution of the longitudinal polarization specified by eq.([eq:1.6 ] ) .",
    "we use here the observation that in qcd the power @xmath54 characterizing the energy dependence of the amplitude is the same for scattering of transversely and longitudinally polarized gluons .    using the gluon propagator in the form given by eq.([eq:1.6 ] ) , we get the following expression for the total contribution of the diagrams shown in fig . 1 : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the sum of the box diagrams describing the @xmath57 scattering and @xmath58 is the amplitude of the gluon scattering off the target @xmath45 .    using the dominance of the longitudinal gluon polarization ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) and incorporating eq.([eq:1.1 ] )",
    "we can rewrite eq.([eq:1.9 ] ) as @xmath59    now we will use the fact that @xmath60 since the box diagram contains no gluons and , therefore , the ward identities in this approximation are the same as in an abelian gauge theory ( @xmath61 are the color indices ) . from eq.([eq:1.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) it follows that @xmath62 and @xmath63 it is useful to define the cross section of @xmath14 scattering off a gluon @xmath64 averaged over the gluon color : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the invariant mass of the produced @xmath67 system : @xmath68 .",
    "thus , @xmath69 in the leading @xmath70 approximation , we can substitute @xmath71 by @xmath72 . comparing our result with the qcd - improved parton model expression for",
    "the production of heavy quarks ( see @xmath73 @xcite ) , we observe that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the gluon distribution in a target @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath79 is the mass of the produced @xmath4 pair , which is typically of the order of @xmath80 .",

    ", higher - order @xmath2 corrections may change @xmath47 by some numerical factor .",
    "this scale - fixing ambiguity is a usual feature of the leading @xmath82-approximation .",
    "now let us express @xmath83 in terms of the light - cone wave functions of the virtual photon . to this end",
    ", we write down the four - momenta @xmath84 of quark ( antiquark ) in the box in terms of the light - cone variables @xmath85 with @xmath86 and take the integral over @xmath87 by residue . introducing the lowest - order perturbative @xmath88 light - cone wave functions of the virtual photon @xcite @xmath89 we obtain the following expression for the sum of the box diagrams : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath92 , @xmath93 being the gell - mann matrices of the @xmath94 group in the fundamental representation .",

    "since the gluon density increases when @xmath5 decreases , @xmath100 slowly increases with decrease of @xmath5 @xcite . for @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "it is instructive to represent @xmath104 in the form @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is the cross section for the interaction of a colorless small transverse size @xmath67-pair with the target @xmath45 : @xmath107 this expression was obtained originally in @xcite . as usual",
    ", @xmath108 is the number of colors , and the casimir operator of the @xmath109 group in the fundamental representation can be easily calculated : @xmath110 combining all the numbers together , we finally obtain : @xmath111 \\alpha_{s}(\\lambda / b^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq:1.27}\\ ] ] here @xmath112 .",
    "this formula describes the essence of the color transparency ( ct ) phenomenon ( @xmath113 . discussion in @xcite ) : @xmath114 configuration of a small spatial size has a small interaction cross section .",
    "however , for sufficiently small @xmath5 , the interaction becomes strong due to the formation of the soft gluon field . in this respect ,",
    "eq.([eq:1.23 ] ) predicts the interaction of a small size configuration which is qualitatively different from that of the models of f. low @xcite and j. gunion and d.soper @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath115 is proportional to the gluon distribution in eq.([eq:1.24 ] ) increasing in the small-@xmath5 region , has important experimental consequences , @xmath116 it makes it possible to observe the small - size quark configurations at hera in the electroproduction of vector mesons at small @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , eq.([eq:1.23 ] ) can be inferred from a formula derived in ref .",
    "@xcite within a model approximation to qcd . using some simple tricks ,",
    "one can also obtain eq.([eq:1.23 ] ) from a formula obtained in @xcite within the leading @xmath117 approximation of @xmath118 combined with some bold assumptions concerning the parton model structure .    using ( [ eq:1.19 ] ) , we can calculate distribution over cross section for the fast photon or pion projectible for small @xmath0 ( @xmath39@xcite ) .",
    "in the previous section we have derived eq.([eq:1.23 ] ) which expresses the @xmath104 cross section in terms of the light - cone wave functions of the virtual photon @xmath14 .",
    "this formula gives us the possibility to calculate another useful quantity - distribution over cross section    @xmath120 . by definition , the differential probability that the virtual photon @xmath14 interacts with the target @xmath45 with the cross section @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the experimentally observable total cross section in terms of @xmath121 is given by @xmath122    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been suggested to represent the cross section @xmath0 in terms of the eigenstates of the @xmath123-matrix . in the case of small @xmath0 , as a result of color screening and asymptotic freedom , the scattering state is a @xmath4 pair .",
    "so , the contribution of small @xmath0 has the form of eq.([eq:1.25 ] ) . using eq.([eq:1.24 ] )",
    ", we can write : @xmath124 let us define @xmath125 where @xmath126 is given by eqs.([eq:1.20 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.21 ] ) .",
    "it is implied here that the functional dependence of @xmath127 on @xmath0 in eq.([eq:2.3 ] ) should be calculated from eq.([eq:1.24 ] ) .",
    "now , we can rewrite eq.([eq:2.2 ] ) in the form of eq.([eq:2.1 ] ) . though our derivation is applicable for the interactions with small @xmath0 , eq.([eq:2.1 ] )",
    "has a more general nature .",
    "in fact , it has been understood long ago @xcite that many features of the interaction of a fast projectile can be described in terms of distribution over cross section .",
    "an important advantage of such a quantity is that it accurately takes into account diffractive processes .",
    "some properties of @xmath121 have been discussed in detail in . however , for our purposes , it is sufficient to consider @xmath128 in the limit @xmath129 .    in general , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) predicts a rather involved dependence of @xmath121 on @xmath130 at small @xmath0 .",
    "however , this dependence can be easily calculated using qcd evolution equations",
    ". the distinctive feature of eq.([eq:2.3 ] ) is that @xmath131",
    "the perturbative version of the virtual photon wave function @xmath132 ( 3.1 ) can be written through a dispersion integral @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the wave function of a non - interacting @xmath88-pair with invariant mass @xmath135 .",
    "the interaction between the quarks modifies the virtual photon wave function @xmath136 , and the dispersion representation @xmath137 for the `` exact '' wave function @xmath138 is in terms of the modified spectral density @xmath139 in which , instead of the free - quark approximation @xmath140 , one has a sum over resonances , the @xmath141-meson being the dominant feature in the low-@xmath135 region : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the magnitude of the @xmath141-state projection onto the electromagnetic current . at large @xmath135 ,",
    "the resonances are wide , and their sum rapidly approaches the free - quark value , @xmath144 one has a perfect quark - hadron duality behaviour of @xmath139 coincides with that of @xmath140 , the dispersion integral in eq.([eq : disp2 ] ) has the same convergence properties as that in eq.([eq : disp ] ) , @xmath145 , no subtractions are needed in eq.([eq : disp2 ] ) . ] . for sufficiently large @xmath47",
    ", the dispersion integral ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) is dominated by higher states , and the free - quark approximation is completely justified .",
    "decreasing @xmath47 , one would observe mismatch between the free - quark calculation and the dispersion integral over the resonances .",
    "such a situation is well known from qcd sum rules : the difference between the resonance and free - quark spectra is described by power corrections @xmath146 .",
    "the usual procedure is to approximate the higher states by the free - quark contribution ( `` first resonance plus continuum '' model ) @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the effective threshold for higher resonances in the @xmath141-channel and then fix its value by the requirement of the best agreement between the two sides of the resulting sum rule @xmath149 after fixing @xmath148 from the magnitude of the power corrections @xmath150 , one can take the limit @xmath151 to get the local duality relation @xmath152 in other words , the @xmath141-meson wave function in such an approach is dual to the free - quark wave functions integrated over the duality interval @xmath153 .    for the forward virtual compton amplitude , the dispersion representation can be applied both for the initial and `` final '' virtual photon .",
    "however , taking only the @xmath141-meson contribution in the dispersion integral for the final state , one naturally obtains the amplitude for the @xmath154 transition considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , picking out the @xmath141-meson contribution in both dispersion integrals one would get the amplitude for the @xmath155 scattering . this idea can be also used to study the pion diffractive electroproduction and the pion diffractive scattering .",
    "to analyze the pion scattering , we substitute the electromagnetic current by the axial current in the original amplitude , @xmath144 simply add @xmath157 in the current vertices . for massless quarks , the final result has the same structure as that for the vector current .",
    "of course , the @xmath88-pair wave function would have an extra @xmath157 , and the vertex factor analogous to that in eq.(5.2 ) is @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the 4-momentum associated with the axial current .",
    "the projection of a single - pion state onto the axial current is specified by the @xmath160 decay constant @xmath161 : @xmath162 hence , we should extract the amplitude @xmath163 corresponding to the longitudinal polarization of the axial current . again , the transition from the virtual amplitude for the currents to that involving the pion can be understood in terms of the dispersion representation and quark - hadron duality .",
    "in other words , below the effective higher state threshold @xmath164 , one should substitute the free - quark contribution by that due to the pion pole : @xmath165 the local duality prescription gives a correctly normalized wave function provided that @xmath166 .",
    "of course , one can use a pion wave function different from that given by the local duality .",
    "however , the duality considerations justify the use of the effective two - body wave function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the actual calculation consists of the same steps as those leading to eq.([eq:1.25 ] ) . for a small - size configuration , we get the following contribution @xmath167 into the scattering cross section : @xmath168 effectively , the vertex @xmath169 is substituted by the pion wave function . rewriting @xmath167 as @xmath170",
    "we obtain : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is given by eq.([eq:1.27 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath173 is determined by the pion wave function at the origin of the impact parameter space , or , what is the same , by the integral of the momentum wave function @xmath174 over all transverse momenta @xmath175 .",
    "this integral formally gives the pion distribution amplitude @xmath176 however , in qcd ( and in any theory with dimensionless coupling constant ) , this integral diverges .",
    "the standard procedure is to supplement the integral with some renormalization prescription characterized by a cut - off parameter @xmath177 , @xmath144 @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , the fourier transformation from the momentum to the impact parameter space @xmath179 for small @xmath127 can also be treated as a particular cut - off prescription with @xmath180 playing the role of the renormalization parameter @xmath177 . in the @xmath181 limit",
    ", one encounters the singular @xmath182 terms .",
    "it is exactly the logarithms which generate the evolution of the pion distribution amplitude .",
    "summing the logarithms by the renormalization group methods gives , for small @xmath127 : @xmath183 where @xmath184 are the eigenfunctions of the evolution kernel ( @xmath185 being the gegenbauer polynomials ) , the anomalous dimensions @xmath186 are its eigenvalues and @xmath187 is the one - loop qcd @xmath188-function coefficient .",
    "the @xmath189-parameter characterizes the effective onset of the perturbative evolution .",
    "the coefficients @xmath190 are the gegenbauer moments of the pion wave function at this scale .",
    "note that the anomalous dimension of the axial current vanishes ( @xmath191 ) and all other @xmath186 s are positive . hence , after the renormalization group improvement , the limit @xmath181 is well - defined in this case and @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "the absolute normalization of the pion wave function for @xmath194 is fixed by the matrix element of the axial current : @xmath195 or in the impact parameter space ( see eq.([eq:1.21 ] ) @xmath196    in other words , for the pion , the singular @xmath197 terms sum into harmless @xmath198 factors vanishing in the @xmath181 limit . as a result",
    ", the @xmath199-dependence of the pion wave function @xmath200 in the formal @xmath181 limit always assumes its asymptotic form @xmath201 , irrespectively of its shape at the scale @xmath189 .",
    "it is natural to expect that @xmath189 is related to the scale characterizing the magnitude of the nonperturbative momentum distribution in the pion .",
    "the momentum scale @xmath202 suggested by the local duality is rather large , and there may exist a transitional region of distances @xmath203 small compared to the pion size but not small enough to produce sizable perturbative evolution effects . in this case , one can try the @xmath199-dependences of @xmath200 different from the asymptotic form .",
    "in fact , the integral @xmath204 is rather insensitive to the evolution effects .",
    "if we take the asymptotic wave function ( [ psiasy ] ) then @xmath205    assuming that , at the scale @xmath206 , the @xmath199-dependence of the pion wave function corresponds to the chernyak - zhitnitsky @xcite ansatz @xmath207 we obtain @xmath208 thus , in this case the evolution would decrease the integral @xmath209 by @xmath210% when @xmath127 changes from @xmath189 to @xmath211 .",
    "taking the asymptotic result , we get : @xmath212    distribution @xmath213 was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of the soft diffractive processes for @xmath214 , see solid curves in fig.2 . in the limit @xmath215",
    ", we can compare this result with eq.([eq:4.13 ] ) .",
    "the applicability region of this equation is restricted by several conditions .",
    "first , @xmath216 should be small enough so that the average longitudinal distances in the scattering process @xmath217 are larger than the nucleon size , which corresponds to @xmath218 . furthermore , the virtualities in the process should be large enough so that one can apply pqcd which corresponds to the requirement @xmath219 . in our analysis",
    "we also neglect the @xmath127-dependence of the wave function of the @xmath4 component at large @xmath127 ( this is a higher twist effect ) , which restricts consideration to @xmath220 . in the numerical calculation",
    ", we use the grv parameterization @xcite since it describes well the parton distributions down to @xmath221 .",
    "we present results both for the leading and next - to - leading order grv parameterizations , see dashed curves in fig.2 .",
    "difference between lo and nlo results illustrates range of uncertainties of the current analysis .",
    "one can see that the results of our calculations are in qualitative agreement with the phenomenological results of @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of our results is a substantial energy dependence of @xmath222 on the incident energy due to a fast increase of @xmath223 with the decrease of @xmath5 , see fig.3 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the probability of point - like configurations in hadrons decreases with the increase of energy .",
    "further diffractive data ( preferably at higher energies ) are necessary to get better information about @xmath1 .",
    "since the existence of configurations with small spatial size has been confirmed experimentally in the energy dependence and absolute value of cross section of electroproduction of vector mesons , we consider the above result as a reflection of soft matching between nonperturbative and pqcd regimes .",
    "in this paper , we applied a pqcd approach to describe the basic features of the high - energy interactions of a small - size @xmath9 configurations with a hadron target .",
    "this interaction is proportional to the gluon distribution function @xmath7 of the target and , hence , the cross section is enhanced in the small-@xmath5 region .",
    "the @xmath9 configuration can be described by the wave functions whose particular form is determined by the projection of the initial particle ( @xmath224 or @xmath225 ) onto the @xmath9 component . for small @xmath0 , we calculated the cross section distribution @xmath11 for the pion and demonstrated that it is rather insensitive to the specific form of the pion distribution amplitude .",
