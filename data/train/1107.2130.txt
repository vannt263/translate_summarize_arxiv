    "the hagedorn conjecture that the density of hadrons in the spectrum grows exponentially with the mass of the hadron is now more than 45 years old @xcite .",
    "it has played an influential role in the development of particle physics with implications ranging from qcd thermodynamics @xcite to string theory @xcite . at a practical level",
    ", it is invoked in present day analysis of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions in the context of resonance gas models @xcite .",
    "given the significance of the hagedorn spectrum , it is important to ascertain whether the conjecture is , in fact , correct .    over the years",
    ", several theoretical arguments have been developed in support of hagedorn conjecture beyond hagedorn s phenomenological motivations .",
    "one argument is that one expects highly excited mesons in qcd to form flux tubes @xcite and the dynamics of long flux tubes are naturally stringlike . since string theories are known to have hagedorn spectra @xcite it is natural to assume that hagedorn spectra exist for mesons , too .",
    "there is a number of other theoretical reasons to believe that qcd has a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "for example , an explicit calculation of the spectrum in qcd with adjoint fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions indicates a hagedorn spectrum @xcite as does a semi - classical analysis of @xmath1 super yang - mills using gauge gravity duality @xcite .",
    "these arguments are quite powerful .",
    "however , they suffer from important limitations .",
    "the first argument is based on an important dynamical assumption , namely that the dynamics really is dominated by stringlike degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter two arguments are based on theories which differ in fundamental ways from qcd .",
    "they both have fermion field content different from qcd , and in one case , a different space - time dimension .",
    "recently , an indirect argument for a hagedorn spectrum was developed for qcd in 3 + 1 dimensions with the correct fermion field content @xcite using properties of a matrix of point - to - point correlation functions of composite operators .    while the argument of refs .",
    "@xcite avoids some of the problems of the other approaches , it shares with them a common limitation : it is based  either implicitly or explicitly  on large @xmath0 qcd rather than qcd with @xmath2 .",
    "consider , for example , the argument based on the dynamics of flux tubes .",
    "it is well known that flux tubes break thereby spoiling their pure stringlike dynamics  and the natural connection to a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "however , it has also long been known that the rate of flux tube breaking is proportional to the length of the flux tube and inversely proportional to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the large @xmath0 limit , flux tubes are arbitrarily long lived and can have simple stringlike dynamics and a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "the analysis based on gauge - gravity duality @xmath3 super yang - mills requires large @xmath0 in its construction and the treatment of qcd with adjoint fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions explicitly uses large @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the analysis in  @xcite depends critically on the large @xmath0 limit in numerous ways .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit of qcd is a reasonable caricature of the real world with @xmath2 for many phenomena .",
    "however , it is not always so .",
    "for example , in the large @xmath0 limit , the @xmath4 meson becomes degenerate with the pion @xcite , while in the real world it is more massive than the nucleon .",
    "another example is the nature of the qcd phase transition at zero chemical potential which is first order at large @xmath0 @xcite but is only a cross - over at @xmath2 and realistic quark masses .",
    "moreover , the existence of a hagedorn spectrum depends on the behavior of the spectrum in a limit  the limit of large masses  and one might worry that the large @xmath0 limit and the large mass limits do not commute . if that is true , the fact that qcd has a hagedorn spectrum at large @xmath0 need not tell us anything about the asymptotically high spectrum for finite @xmath0 .",
    "so , it is important to see if one can verify the hagedorn conjecture without reliance on theoretical tools valid only in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit was introduced into the problem to simplify the quite complicated theoretical problem of describing hadronic physics .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask whether one can establish the hagedorn spectrum  or at least provide solid support for it  from experimental data alone and thus bypass the complicated theoretical issues which prompted the large @xmath0 analysis in the first place .",
    "traditionally , the hagedorn spectrum was specified in terms of a density of hadron states ( perhaps limited to some particular class of hadrons ) as a function of mass , @xmath5 , whose definition requires some type of smearing . the number of hadronic degrees of freedom with mass between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where a hadron of intrinsic angular momentum @xmath9 is counted as having @xmath10 degrees of freedom .",
    "the hagedorn spectrum was one for which this density asymptotes at large @xmath6 to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the parameter known as the hagedorn temperature and @xmath13 is a subexponential function which asymptotes to a power law at large @xmath6 .",
    "however , as noted by dienes and cudell @xcite and broniowski and florkowski @xcite , a more useful quantity in analyzing the data than @xmath5 is the so - called accumulated spectrum : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spin of the @xmath16 meson and @xmath17 is the heavyside step function . thus @xmath18 represents the total number of hadronic degrees of freedom ( perhaps restricted to some class of hadron ) with mass below @xmath6 .",
    "the hagedorn conjecture can be stated that at large @xmath6 , @xmath18 asymptotes to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a subexponential function satisfying @xmath21 .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is useful to ask which hadrons ought to be included in an analysis . as noted above",
    ", theoretical arguments suggest that at large @xmath0 both mesons and glueballs ought to have hagedorn spectra with the same @xmath12 . however , it is by no means clear that these theoretical arguments justify a hagedorn spectrum for baryons  even at large @xmath0 .",
    "attempts to fit the baryons by a hagedorn spectrum yielded a different hagedorn temperature than for mesons @xcite and the underlying origin of this is not well understood .",
    "accordingly , we will restrict our attention to hadrons with meson quantum numbers . note that if glueballs exist , they have the same quantum numbers as flavor neutral mesons and , except in the theoretical world of large @xmath0 , mix with them .",
    "thus , there is no unambiguous way to separate glueballs from mesons in any analysis .",
    "for this reason when we refer to mesons here we mean hadrons with meson quantum numbers including any possible states with large glueball content .",
    "for concreteness we will only consider nonstrange mesons .",
    "we do this for practical reasons : one expects qualitatively similar behavior for both strange and nonstrange mesons  indeed precisely the same behavior in the flavor su(3 ) limit  however , the strange quark mass will displace strange mesons relative to nonstrange ones and thus may influence attempts to extract a hagedorn temperature from the data .",
    "however , to ensure that the conclusions we reach are not an artifact of the restriction to non - strange mesons only , in section  ( [ all ] ) we extend the analysis made for non - strange mesons to all hadrons including baryons . as we show in that section , the inclusion of all hadrons in the analysis does not alter any of the qualitative conclusions .    at first sight",
    ", it appears to be a simple matter to test the hagedorn conjecture .",
    "note that @xmath22 where the arrow indicates the behavior at large @xmath6 .",
    "however , the hagedorn conjecture is that @xmath18 asymptotes to @xmath23 at large @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , if one defines @xmath24 according to @xmath25 then the hagedorn conjecture is equivalent to the statement that @xmath26 asymptotes at large @xmath6 to a constant value  which we can identify as the hagedorn temperature . note that if the hagedorn conjecture is correct , then @xmath26 asymptotes to the hagedorn temperature at large mass regardless of the form of the subexponential prefactor .",
    "so , in principle all that is needed to verify the conjecture is to find the empirical @xmath18 at arbitrarily large @xmath6 and verify that @xmath24 does indeed asymptote .    unfortunately this is not practical . to see why consider the plot in figure  [ empiricalall ] of @xmath18 for nonstrange mesons based on meson masses from the 2010 report of particle data group @xcite",
    "up to approximately 2.3 gev , @xmath18 appears to be growing essentially exponentially  the data fluctuate around a simple exponential fit with fluctuations whose relative size becomes small with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with what one expects from a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "however , above 2.35  gev , @xmath18 bends sharply away from the exponential .",
    "there is a natural explanation for this : as energies of reactions increase allowing access to higher mass resonances , it becomes increasingly difficult to identify resonances in the typically quite complicated , many - channel partial - wave analysis needed .",
    "thus , the lack of reported high mass resonances does not necessarily indicate that they are not present , but only that they can not be extracted from the scattering data .",
    "this means that we can not use empirical spectrum at extremely high masses to verify the hagedorn conjecture with an arbitrarily high level of confidence .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior below 2.3 gev looks to be consistent with the hagedorn conjecture and provides at least moderately strong evidence for it .",
    "indeed , the quality of this data has been considered as providing evidence for exponential growth in @xmath18 @xcite . to make the consistency with hagedorn conjecture a bit more clear , it is useful to plot @xmath24 as defined in  ( [ theffdef ] ) for masses below 2.3 gev .",
    "this is done in figure  [ theff ] . while it is not completely certain from the data within the range considered that @xmath24 is really approaching an asymptotic value , it seems quite plausible that if we had reliable data available above 2.3 gev , @xmath24 would asymptote to a value near 360 mev .",
    "however , despite this apparent evidence for the hagedorn conjecture seen in this data , as will be discussed in this paper , the evidence for the hagedorn conjecture from the meson spectral data is actually quite weak , if there is at all .",
    "( as defined in  ( [ theffdef ] ) ) plotted against @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed line is a constant at 360 mev and is included to guide the eye .",
    "the meson masses are taken from the 2010 report of particle data group@xcite .",
    ", width=268 ]    before proceeding , it is important to note that the `` data '' on meson masses included in figure  [ theff ] are not really data .",
    "rather the masses are the results of model - dependent fits .",
    "model dependence occurs because the hadrons are resonances with non - vanishing widths rather than particles and these resonant structures exist on top of non - resonant backgrounds . since we do not have theoretical control of these backgrounds ,",
    "they must be modeled , and how they are modeled can affect the properties of the resonances including the mass .",
    "of course , if the widths are small and the resonances well separated , then ambiguities due to this model dependence are small and properties of the resonances can be extracted with relatively small uncertainties . however , if the resonances are broad and overlapping this is not the case , and the properties of a resonance can not be pinned down with much certainty from the data  including the critical property of whether or not the resonance exists . ultimately , it is precisely this kind of difficulty in extracting resonance properties from scattering data which limits us to relatively low masses in our studies of @xmath18 .",
    "the fact that the masses used in constructing figure  [ theff ] are based on model - dependent fits presents both practical and theoretical difficulties . at a practical level",
    "it raises the question of how to deal with uncertainties in the extracted hadron masses .",
    "the extracted masses have estimated uncertainties @xcite ; however , these estimates include uncertainties due to the model dependence as well as statistical uncertainties and it is not clear how these should be handled",
    ". fortunately , if the data are in the regime where @xmath6 is large enough so that hagedorn exponential growth is dominant , @xmath24 should be very insensitive to these uncertainties .",
    "a crude estimate is that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the typical uncertainty in the extracted mass .",
    "if we assume that the spectrum is in the hagedorn regime by @xmath29 gev and take the typical uncertainty to be around 50 mev , then  ( [ uncert ] ) suggests an uncertainty in @xmath30 of order of 1 mev .",
    "this is quite small on the scale of @xmath31 and can be neglected unless one requires an exceptionally accurate extraction of @xmath12 from the data .",
    "however , as will be shown in detail in this paper , the data are clearly not sufficiently good to demonstrate that the spectrum is in the hagedorn regime by @xmath29 gev , and thus it is pointless to attempt a very accurate extraction of @xmath12 .",
    "given this situation we will neglect the uncertainties in the meson masses in all of our analysis .",
    "there is also a theoretical issue .",
    "since the hagedorn spectrum depends sensitively on the properties of mesonic resonances  namely the existence of the meson and the value of its mass  for high mass resonances , and since these appear to be intrinsically ambiguous with the ambiguity growing with mass , one might worry that the ambiguity due to model dependence renders the question of whether or not a hagedorn spectrum exists for qcd ( for finite @xmath0 ) ill - posed as a matter of principle .",
    "fortunately , as a mathematical proposition this is not the case . in principle , _ if _ one could fully solve qcd , one could compute the correlation function and then analytically continue it for unphysical values of the momenta including complex values .",
    "the analytic structure of these correlators contains enough information to answer whether a hagedorn spectrum exists in principle .    to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the two - point correlation function for a local composite operator with scalar quantum numbers .",
    "this is a function of one variable , @xmath32 .",
    "the analytic structure for @xmath33 , the correlator , can be quite complicated with multiple cuts associated with @xmath34-pion thresholds . however , we know that the `` physical sheet '' only has singularities along the real axis for @xmath35 . the strength of this singularity is the spectral function for the correlator up to an overall factor .",
    "narrow resonances are associated with regions in @xmath32 where the spectral function is large and sharply peaked .",
    "if all we know is information from the physical sheet , we can identify resonances only by some model - dependent fit .",
    "of course , narrow resonance properties can be determined with little ambiguity .",
    "however , fits to broad resonance will be highly model dependent .",
    "suppose , though , one could fully solve the theory including its full analytic structure .",
    "thus , by hypothesis , we would have access to unphysical riemann sheets as well as the physical one .",
    "there can be poles on the unphysical sheets .",
    "moreover , provided that the poles are close to the real axis , their existence greatly constrains the behavior of the spectral function on the physical sheet .",
    "the real part of the pole largely fixes the position in @xmath32 where the spectral function peaks _ i.e. _ , the mass of the resonance  and the imaginary part similarly fixes the width .",
    "of course , if the poles are not close to the axis , their effect on the pole on the spectral function is far more subtle . in that case",
    ", the pole does _ not _ fix the spectral strength to be a bump centered on the value of the real part with a width determined by an imaginary part .",
    "given this situation it is natural to _ define _ the resonance mass to be the real part of the associated pole on a non - physical sheet in the appropriate correlator ( or scattering amplitude ) .",
    "where there is little ambiguity in the resonance mass as seen from the physical sheet , this prescription reproduces that value ( to within the scale of the ambiguity ) . where the ambiguity is large , this prescription resolves the ambiguity in a well - defined manner . from this perspective , the question of whether qcd has a hagedorn spectrum is well posed .",
    "does @xmath18 grow exponentially where @xmath6 corresponds to the pole position on an unphysical sheet ?",
    "unfortunately , the definition given above  while making the question well defined in a formal sense  does not aid us in the practical matter of answering the question from scattering data , which by definition , is only directly sensitive to the behavior of the physical sheet .",
    "all that we can do is to look at the mesons whose masses can be determined with relatively small ambiguity and see how these behave and from this attempt to extrapolate to the full function .    with this clarification in mind , let us turn to the question of whether the data below 2.3 gev should be taken as strongly supporting the hagedorn conjecture .",
    "the first hint that something may be problematic lies in the fact that the apparent value of @xmath12in the range of 360 mev  is quite high compared to the value of @xmath36 mev extracted by hagedorn @xcite from hadron - hadron scattering data . while values of approximately this size @xcite and nearly as large @xcite have been seen in fits to the hadron spectrum ,",
    "historically most fits have given much smaller values much more consistent with hagedorn s original value .",
    "for example , a recent extraction by cleymans and d. worku @xcite gives a hagedorn temperature of 174 mev .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , the differences in the extracted values in the various fits depend sensitively on the functional form of the prefactor to the exponential and the choice of function typically used historically drops off as @xmath6 increases and thus biases the fitted hagedorn temperature towards smaller values . note also that the small value of  @xcite is based on a fit including baryons , which  as noted earlier  has little justification .",
    "the large value observed here might be seen as being in tension with the standard picture of hagedorn .",
    "there is another potential problem with the large apparent value of the hagedorn temperature seen in this spectral data .",
    "lattice calculation at relatively large @xmath0 estimates the hagedorn temperature from a thermodynamic treatment of the metastable hadronic phase above the deconfinement transition ( which is first order at large @xmath0 ) and finds a hagedorn temperature which is only slightly larger than @xmath37 @xcite . to the extent that the large @xmath0 world is similar to the world of @xmath2",
    ", one would expect that the hagedorn temperature at @xmath2 would also be slightly above @xmath37 .",
    "however , the hagedorn temperature extracted from the spectrum here appears to be approximately double the @xmath37 .",
    "given the potential problems associated with the apparently large hagedorn temperature seen in the meson data , it is useful to ask in detail the extent to which the meson spectral data can be interpreted as strong evidence for hagedorn conjecture .",
    "three reasons for caution will be discussed in this paper .",
    "the first is simply that the rapid increase of @xmath18 with @xmath6 seen in the data below 2.3  gev is well described by simple quark models based on quark - antiquark potentials lacking gluonic degrees of freedom . while broniowski @xcite previously noted that quark models can describe the rapid rise in @xmath18 , in this paper we observe that even though these models have mesons with arbitrarily high masses , they do not have hagedorn spectra .",
    "this shows explicitly that the behavior seen in the data does not necessarily imply a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "a second reason concerns a more detailed analysis of the data .",
    "the region over which the data look to be qualitatively exponential is actually rather small and we show that it is possible to qualitatively reproduce the data with a variety of function forms for the prefactor @xmath20 .",
    "as has been noted elsewhere @xcite , different reasonable forms yield quite different values of the hagedorn temperature indicating that the hagedorn temperature is not well determined from the data . however , as is stressed in this paper , if the data were dominated by exponential growth over many e - foldings , the value of @xmath12 would be insensitive to the form of the prefactor .",
    "the fact that it is not implies that the limited data available are not sufficient to conclude that the data are exponential .",
    "indeed , it is possible to reproduce the data quite well with an infinite hagedorn temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , spectrum without exponential growth and thus inconsistent with the hagedorn conjecture .",
    "moreover , this can be done in a natural way with a simple power law and does not involve mocking up an exponential by multiple power laws .    in principle , one could avoid the uncertainty in the hagedorn temperature if one knew the precise form of the prefactor @xmath20 from an underlying model . there have been attempts to determine the prefactor from the statistical bootstrap model @xcite or a string model @xcite . however , the issue under consideration here is not how to extract @xmath12 from the data .",
    "rather , it is whether the data are sufficiently dominated by the exponential growth so that by themselves they provide strong evidence for the hagedorn conjecture .",
    "a third reason is associated with the behavior of the spectrum in various channels associated with fixed meson quantum numbers . consistency between a hagedorn spectrum and the successful regge phenomenology requires that the channel with the most hadrons grows exponentially with a growth characterized by a hagedorn temperature equal to that of the whole set .",
    "however , if one looks at a channel - by - channel basis the data are not consistent with this scenario .",
    "this suggests that the available data are not in a regime dominated by hagedorn behavior .",
    "rather , the behavior observed is consistent with the possibility that much of the rapid increase seen in @xmath18 is due to the opening of new channels with increasing @xmath6 rather than the exponential growth within the channels .",
    "while it is easy to see that the effect of opening new channels can by itself only lead to power law growth in @xmath18 , it can also lead to a rapid growth which can be mistaken for exponential growth over a limited range .",
    "for more than four decades quark models  quantum mechanical models based on potentials between quarks  have played an important phenomenological role in describing hadrons .",
    "one of the great ironies in modern physics is that while the quark model was a critical step in the development of the ideas leading to qcd , its connection to qcd remains quite obscure .",
    "the principle reason for this obscurity is that while qcd has both quarks and gluons as dynamical degrees of freedom , quark models only have quarks .",
    "to the extent that quark models do a phenomenologically adequate job for many purposes , the main effects of the gluon dynamics is somehow encoded in the parameters of the model .",
    "accordingly , quark models have important intrinsic limitations : effects which probe gluodynamics in detail can not be described by simple quark models .",
    "clearly there exist important phenomena in hadronic physics that simple quark models can not describe .",
    "an example of this are mesons with `` exotic '' quantum numbers  namely those whose quantum numbers can not be obtained in simple quark models with only quark - antiquark degrees of freedom  such as mesons with @xmath38 . in quark model language such states are referred to as `` hybrid mesons '' and are associated with excitations of `` valence gluons '' ; models based on a flux tube predict such states .",
    "it is known that such states exist and are narrow in large @xmath0 qcd @xcite .",
    "the particle data group @xcite includes two exotic @xmath39 mesons with @xmath38 among the well - established mesons .",
    "there is good reason to believe that the physics associated with the hagedorn spectrum is precisely the kind of gluon - dominated dynamics that simple quark models are incapable of describing .",
    "consider for example the notion that a hagedorn spectrum arises from the dynamics of long flux tubes acting like strings . in that case , the dynamical degrees of freedom ",
    "the oscillations of the flux tubes  are associated with the gluon rather than quark degrees of freedom ; the flux tubes are gluonic in nature .",
    "similarly the indirect argument of  @xcite is based on a matrix of correlation functions of an exponentially large number of operators which differ only in their gluonic content .    if it is indeed the case that simple quark models are not capable of giving rise to a hagedorn spectrum , and if such models _ are _ capable of describing accurately the rapid rise seen in @xmath18 for meson masses below 2300 mev , it follows logically that this rapid rise in @xmath18 need not imply a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "as will be shown in this section , there do indeed exist quark models which describe the rapid rise in @xmath18 seen in the empirical data and do not have a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "thus , we conclude that the data does not , by itself , provide strong evidence for a hagedorn spectrum .    for concreteness",
    ", we will illustrate this point by considering in some detail the classic `` relativized '' quark model of godfrey and isgur @xcite ; we shall refer to this as the gi model , which is particularly easy to analyze .",
    "let us start looking at the behavior of @xmath18 for this model .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ gi ] along with the empirical curve using data from the particle data group .",
    "while it is clear that in detail , the gi model does not precisely reproduce the empirical spectrum , it does have the same qualitative behavior : @xmath18 rises quite rapidly with @xmath6 in a fashion which looks to be consistent with a spectrum asymptoting at large @xmath6 to one with an exponential growth .",
    "there is nothing particularly special about this model from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ others ] the qualitative behavior for @xmath18 seen in the gi model is also present in other more recent quark models @xcite .",
    "based only on the data in these plots , it would be quite hard to argue that the empirical data seem to be clearly that of a hagedorn spectrum while those of the quark models are not .     for the gi quark model @xcite ( left figure ) and for the the empirical spectrum using data taken from the particle data group @xcite ( right figure ) .",

    "the dynamical degrees of freedom in the model are fully characterized by the positions and conjugate momenta of the quark and antiquark and the spin degrees of freedom of the two .",
    "the dynamics is fully specified in some reference frame by a hamiltonian in terms of these degrees of freedom .",
    "3 .   the dynamics of the center of mass motion decouples from the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the internal dynamics is specified by the spins and the position and momenta associated with the relative degrees of freedom and the spin .",
    "the mass of the meson is identified as the energy of the system at zero center of mass momentum .",
    "4 .   in the limit where @xmath40 ( the magnitude of the relative momentum ) and @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the magnitude of the relative position , and @xmath43 is a parameter identified as the string tension ) are characteristically larger than all other quantities in the problem except the energy , the hamiltonian , is independent of spin and only depends on @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "[ lim ]    criterion [ lim ] is particularly important .",
    "it tells us that highly excited states in such models are dominated by the physics of ultrarelativistic quarks moving in a confining potential .",
    "thus in this regime the hamiltonian asymptotes to a function of the form @xmath44 .",
    "the detailed form of @xmath45 plays no role in what follows  the critical issue is the parametric dependence .",
    "clearly the gi model fulfills these criteria .    since the hamiltonian is asymptotically fixed by @xmath44 at high energy , it is sufficient to use this form to compute @xmath18 in the asymptotically high mass regime . moreover , in this regime it is legitimate to use the weyl , semi - classical formula to obtain @xmath18 : @xmath46 where @xmath17 represents a unit step function , and the constant depends on the details of @xmath44 .",
    "the important point is that while @xmath47 grows quite rapidly with @xmath6 , it grows like a power law@xmath48and not an exponential .",
    "thus quark models of this type including the gi model do not have hagedorn spectra . since the gi model does have a rapidly increasing @xmath18 below 2.3 gev which is qualitatively similar to what is seen for the empirical data , it is apparent that this type of qualitative behavior is not by itself strong evidence that the underlying system possesses a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "in the previous section we showed that quark models which lack hagedorn spectra produced rapidly increasing @xmath18 of a form which was qualitatively similar to that seen in the empirical data below 2.3 gev . as suggested above that implies that the qualitative behavior seen in @xmath18 is not strong evidence for a hagedorn spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that quark models have parameters and in one way or another these are chosen to _",
    "fit _ the hadronic data .",
    "given this situation , one might wonder whether the data might really naturally suggest a hagedorn spectrum with an exponential growth of @xmath18 but because the data exists only over a limited domain in @xmath6 and has large fluctuations , this exponential behavior is mocked up well by the non - exponential spectrum of the quark model via the fitting of parameters . in this section ,",
    "we test the plausibility of this scenario .    of course , it _ is _ rather easy to mock up an exponential growth over a limited domain by functions which grow only as power laws .",
    "for example , consider the function @xmath49 . over the domain @xmath50 , where @xmath51 increases by more than a factor of 50",
    ", @xmath52 reproduces @xmath53 with quite high accuracy ; the error at the top to the domain is still under 0.3% . on the other hand , a function of the form of @xmath52 which just happens to reproduce the first 11 terms of the taylor series of an exponential in almost any circumstance looks to be unnatural ",

    "nevertheless it is instructive to look at the empirical spectrum in some detail .",
    "one possible way to proceed is to attempt to fit the empirical @xmath18 with various `` reasonable '' functional forms using `` reasonable '' fitting schemes .",
    "one condition on a functional form being reasonable is that it should have few parameters so that it is unlikely able to mock up the wrong exponential behavior by parameter fitting . if @xmath18 really is naturally exponential over a sufficiently large range , one should find that it is difficult to get a `` reasonable '' fit of the data unless the functional form is @xmath54 where @xmath20 is a subexponential form .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath12 extracted should be fairly similar in all reasonably good fits to reasonable forms of @xmath20 .",
    "if , on the other hand , one finds that various good fits to reasonable functional form yield radically different values of @xmath12 one would be forced to conclude that the available data do not , by themselves , naturally suggest an exponential behavior characterized by a fixed hagedorn temperature .",

    "similarly , if there are reasonably good fits to the data using only reasonable functional forms which grow slower than exponentially , one would again be forced to conclude that the data by itself does not naturally suggest exponential behavior .    before proceeding",

    "this difficulty of quantifying the quality of the fit has at its origin in the fact that the hagedorn conjecture is a statement about the spectrum at arbitrarily large mass and we have no real theoretical control on how rapidly the spectrum should approach its asymptotic form and thus no way to quantify the size of any systematic errors in the fit . despite this",

    "various fits with different prefactors give radically different hagedorn temperatures .",
    "moreover , a two parameter fit with a single power law explains the data at least as well as a two - parameter fit containing exponentials .",
    "the real lesson appears to be that the data available for @xmath18 are simply not good enough to decide whether the growth is likely to be exponential at large mass .",
    "in the previous two sections we demonstrated that the data for mesons with masses less than 2300 mev , while consistent with @xmath18 growing exponentially , are also consistent with subexponential growth including the sort one might expect from a quark model . in this section , we show that if one looks at the data in more detail , the available data appear to be in a regime inconsistent with hagedorn behavior in which growth of @xmath18 is dominated by an exponential over many e - folds .    to see why , let us start by noting that mesons with various combinations of angular momentum , parity , charge conjugation and isospin are included in @xmath18 .",
    "it is helpful to decompose @xmath18 in terms of the various angular momentum - parity - charge conjugation - isospin channels which contribute @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents a particular spin - parity - isospin channel and @xmath78 is the accumulated spectrum for mesons restricted to that channel .",

    "as noted in the introduction , there are strong theoretical arguments for the existence of a hagedorn spectrum for mesons ( and glueballs ) separately from baryons .",
    "since these arguments do not directly apply to the baryon spectrum , it seems that the most sensible way to test the hagedorn conjecture is via a study of mesons only .",
    "this logic is reinforced by the empirical evidence that the rate of growth in the number of hadrons appears to be qualitatively different for mesons and baryons @xcite since this implies that a combined analysis might give misleading results .",
    "this is particularly true , given the existence of a threshold effect  the baryon spectrum does not start until nearly 1 gev which may further distort a combined analysis . given these circumstances the best test of hagedorn s conjecture is presumably for the meson spectrum as was done here .    there is a possible objection to this procedure .",
    "one might worry that hagedorn s conjecture only holds when _ all _ hadrons including baryons are included ; after all hagedorn s original analysis included all hadrons .",

    "one can trivially exclude the possibility that the hagedorn conjecture is true for all hadrons but holds for neither the baryon spectrum nor meson spectrum separately .    despite this",
    ", one might nevertheless ask the question of whether the analysis done for mesons would yield qualitatively different results when applied to the spectrum of all hadrons . one possible advantage to doing such a combined analysis",

    "in particular , the data are available over too limited a range to demonstrate convincingly that the data is in a regime dominated by exponential growth .        in figure  [ allhadrons",
    "] we have plotted the accumulated spectrum .",
    "let us note that the significant bend from the straight line in the logarithmic plot ( representing exponential growth ) occurs already at @xmath96 2.0 gev .",
    "as noted earlier , such a bend is easily explainable by an increasing difficulty of extraction of high - lying states properties . given this ,",
    "our analysis of all hadrons must be limited to an even smaller region of masses ( 1.0 - 2.0 gev ) than the analysis of only non - strange mesons ( 1.0 - 2.3 gev ) , where the bend is observed at a somewhat higher mass .",
    "thus , the analysis in this section will not only be limited to a smaller region of masses than done for meson in sections  [ empiricalspectrum ] and [ channel ] , but also is likely to be distorted by the presence of various types of particles ( strange , charmed , baryons , mesons ,  ) .",
    "the most obvious effect is the baryonic threshold around 1 gev and their much faster growth rate .",
    "the fits to the accumulated spectrum of all hadrons were done as they were in section  [ empiricalspectrum ] and are summarized in table [ allhadronfourfits ] and in figure  [ allhadronfits ] .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar to the case of non - strange mesons only .",
    "once again , one can not definitively favor any of the fits based on direct comparisons with the data ; all of them reproduce the data well enough so that discrepancies can easily be accounted for by the limited range of data and their uncertainties .",
    "however , the various fits lead to hagedorn temperatures which differ greatly : ranging from 180 mev to 390 mev . a difference by more than a factor of two _ in an exponent",
    "_ is a large difference indeed and suggests that the data is over too small a range to conclude the behavior is exponential . the fact that a pure power law fit describes the data as well as any of the exponential fits reinforces this point . using the same argument as in the section  [ empiricalspectrum ] ,",

    "indeed , this kind of evidence appeared sufficiently compelling for the authors of  @xcite to indicate a regime of validity of the hagedorn hypothesis as seen in the data with an upper bound of approximately 2.3 gev .",

    "had the spectrum actually been in the hagedorn regime in which the growth in the number of mesons with @xmath6 was dominated by exponential growth over many e - foldings , the hagedorn temperature extracted from different fits should be roughly the same for any reasonable form of the prefactor to the exponential .",

    "consequently , the hagedorn temperature for this fit is qualitatively similar to the pure exponential .",

    ", one can easily imagine that that the qualitative behavior favoring this fits  the fact that a logarithmic plot of @xmath18 curves downward could be an artifact . as discussed in the introduction , as @xmath6 increases it becomes increasingly difficult to extract resonances from the scattering data .",
    "thus , it is plausible that with increasing @xmath6 an increasing fraction of resonances is missed in the analysis of the scattering data .",
    "this would have the effect of causing an artificial bend downward in the logarithmic plot of @xmath18 and would artificially improve the quality of the fits with high  or infinite  hagedorn temperatures .",
    "given these concerns , we are quite reluctant to argue that the spectral data disfavor exponential growth unless there is a very high hagedorn temperature . at the same time , the available data clearly do _ not _ favor exponential growth with a low hagedorn temperature .",
    "indeed , our overall conclusion is simply that the quality of the spectral data and its limited range appears to be inadequate for drawing any conclusions about the nature of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath18 .    in the introduction",
    ", stress was placed on the importance of using empirical data on the spectrum to establish the hagedorn hypothesis for qcd in the physical world with @xmath2 .",

    "however , it is by no means clear how these large @xmath0 arguments can be extended to finite @xmath0 .",
