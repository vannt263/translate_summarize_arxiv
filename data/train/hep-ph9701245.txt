    "in planning for the next linear collider @xcite , it is important that one in addition to the electron - positron mode also considers the electron - electron mode @xcite .",
    "one reason for this is that one can produce states not readily accessible in the annihilation channel .",
    "another reason is that polarization of the electron beams will be readily available .",
    "the initial state consisting of two electrons is also a very clean state , there is no background from annihilation processes    when the higgs particle is discovered and its mass has been measured , one will want to explore other properties of this particle .",
    "one of these is whether it is a scalar or a pseudoscalar .",
    "the higgs predicted by the standard model is a scalar particle .",
    "however , certain extensions of the standard model allow for more than one higgs particle",
    ". we can have both scalar and pseudoscalar higgs particles in these models .",
    "this is the case in the mssm @xcite .",
    "when a possible candidate for the higgs is observed , it is therefore of the utmost importance to determine its properties , and in particular its @xmath0 .    the possibility of disentangling the @xmath0 of the higgs particle in the electron - electron mode will here be considered .",
    "this question has already been considered for the bjorken process , where distributions in polar angle provide an easy resolution @xcite .",
    "also , azimuthal and energy distributions can be used for an independent determination of the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the tree level diagrams for the process @xmath5 are those where the higgs particle ( scalar or pseudoscalar ) is produced via the fusion of two @xmath6 particles .",
    "there are two diagrams at the tree level because of identical electrons in the final state . for",
    "the @xmath7 coupling one can take @xcite @xmath8 here , distributions which are obtained when all outgoing leptons are detected will be considered .",
    "the more favoured production via @xmath9 fusion will therefore not be discussed in this paper .",
    "one expects the higgs to be light .",
    "therefore , in the numerical calculations , a higgs mass of 135  gev has been used .",
    "this value is consistent with a large number of models .",
    "the two electrons in the final state will be distinguished according to which has the higher energy , thus @xmath10 .",
    "the angles between the final state and the initial state electrons are denoted @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 since the process contains three particles in the final state , the incoming and outgoing particles will not all lie in the same plane .",
    "but the two momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 will determine a plane , and similarly for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the angle between these two planes will be denoted @xmath18 , @xmath19 , thus @xmath20 for pure states of positive helicity and @xmath21 for pure states of negative helicity .",
    "the four - fold differential cross section @xmath22 is calculated in both the scalar and the pseudoscalar case .",
    "the variable @xmath23 is the ( positive ) energy difference between the two final - state electrons , thus @xmath24 .",
    "this fully differential cross section is not easily studied experimentally , and therefore only cross sections obtained by integrating over two or three of the variables will be considered . in the extreme forward directions",
    "the electrons will be difficult to detect .",
    "therefore , a cut on the polar angles @xmath25 is imposed in such a way that @xmath26 , whenever an integration over these variables is performed .      the azimuthal distribution @xmath27 has been determined by numerical integration , and is shown in figure 1 for two different beam energies ( 150  gev and 250  gev ) and at various polarizations for both scalar and pseudoscalar higgs . for the unpolarized case the distributions are rather similar for a @xmath0-odd and a @xmath0-even higgs at a beam energy of 150  gev .",
    "at a higher energy , @xmath28=250  gev , one can see a distinct difference between the two cases .",
    "this difference can be enhanced by turning on electron polarization . in the case of opposite polarizations ( 100% )",
    ", one sees that the @xmath0-even distribution behaves like @xmath29 while the @xmath0-odd distribution behaves more like @xmath30 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath31 has its origin in interference between transverse @xmath6-particles with parallel and orthogonal linear polarizations , whereas a term proportional to @xmath32 will arise from interference between scalar and transversely polarized vector bosons @xcite . in the more realistic case of 85% electron",
    "polarization one can get nearly the same effect as by increasing the beam energy to around 250  gev .      from purely kinematical considerations",
    "one can show that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the corresponding higgs mass .",
    "a new variable , the `` scaled energy difference '' , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , is therefore introduced .",
    "the @xmath37-distribution @xmath38 is shown in figure 2 . as can be seen from the plots , the distributions are rather similar in both the @xmath0-even and the @xmath0-odd case .",
    "a minor gain can be obtained from polarizing the beams , but probably too small to be useful in determining the @xmath0 of the higgs .",
    "finally , the two - dimensional polar angle distribution @xmath39 is considered .",
    "representative plots are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the plots are made for the unpolarized case only .",
    "little can be gained by using electron polarization when considering this distribution .",
    "the @xmath0-odd distribution totally changes nature as one increases the beam energy from 100  gev to 200  gev .",
    "the @xmath0-odd and @xmath0-even distributions are easier to distinguish from each other at the lower beam energies . as the beam energy increases , they both peak in the forward region where @xmath40 .",
    "but the production occuring in the forward region for @xmath41 is still an order of magnitude lower than what is the case for @xmath42 .",
    "among the three different distributions presented here , the azimuthal distribution and the polar angle distribution are those that contain the clearest signatures of the @xmath0 of the higgs . the azimuthal distribution can be made quite distinct if beam polarization is available , in particular if the two beams are oppositely polarized . also , one gets better separation at higher energies .    for the two - dimensional polar angle distribution , the difference between @xmath43 and @xmath41 is most striking at lower energies . in the @xmath0-even case ,",
    "the scattered electrons are forward peaked . as the beam energy increases , the distributions",
    "get more forward peaked . in the @xmath0-odd case",
    ", there is a qualitative change from low to higher energies . at low energies ( or heavy higgs )",
    "the electrons tend to be scattered out to large angles , @xmath44 , whereas at higher energies the distributions peak _ near _ the forward direction . _",
    "_    it is a pleasure to thank my collaborators c.  a.  be and per osland for helpful discussions and suggestions along the way .",
    "i will also thank i.  f.  ginzburg for addressing the question of the origin of the different azimuthal distributions .",
