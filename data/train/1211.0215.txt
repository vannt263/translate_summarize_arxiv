    "symmetric informationally - complete positive operator - valued measures ( sics ) @xcite represent a general form of measurement in quantum theory . as the more familiar projective measurements are associated to an orthonormal basis in hilbert space , a sic is associated to an over - complete set of @xmath0 unit vectors in @xmath1 such that the absolute value of the scalar product between any distinct two is always constant , i.e. @xmath2 @xmath3 sics have practical applications in quantum state tomography @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , classical high precision radar @xcite and classical speech recognition @xcite .",
    "a significant amount of work is aimed towards proving their existence in all dimensions although no general proof is currently known .",
    "numerical studies have successfully found sics when @xmath4 @xcite and analytical solutions have been published for 20 of these dimensions ( see references in @xcite plus recent solutions for @xmath5 in @xcite and @xmath6 in @xcite ) .",
    "such results promote the belief that sics can always be found , but the current solutions are rather dimension - dependent and do not provide an overall coherent picture .",
    "all known sics are group covariant , meaning they can be obtained from the action of a group on a single fiducial vector .",
    "the vast majority of sics are covariant with respect to the weyl - heisenberg ( wh ) group and if the dimension is a prime , it has been shown this is the only possible group @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only consider such sics .",
    "there are a few curious properties of sics that are not yet understood , but clearly hint at an underlying mathematical structure",
    ". this scenario could support suggestions that sics should play a deeper role in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the most well - known of these properties is the conjecture of zauner symmetry , which states that every sic vector is an eigenvector of a certain order three unitary matrix @xcite .",
    "another property stems from current sic solutions ; in a preferred basis , the components of the sic vectors are expressed as nested radicals .",
    "such complex numbers are quite exceptional and arise because the galois group of the polynomial equation one must solve is solvable @xcite .",
    "however , it is a third observation that we shall focus on in this paper , namely the connection between sics and algebraic curves in dimension 3 .",
    "the wh group appears naturally in the theory of elliptic curves @xcite , suggesting this might be an advantageous framework for the study of sics .",
    "furthermore , there is a very close connection between elliptic curves and linear dependencies among sic vectors in dimension 3 , first noted by lane hughston @xcite .",
    "this leads to the hesse configuration in the complex projective plane  a particular structure well - known in algebraic geometry .",
    "we aim to explore this special connection , looking for analogous linear dependencies in higher dimensions .",
    "it was our hope that another configuration in complex projective space might reveal some new structure behind sics and broaden the areas from which they can be studied .",
    "this did not turn out quite as planned for all the sics we looked at but we do see similarities for certain sics in dimension 8 , which could signal another connection to elliptic curves .",
    "no sets of @xmath7 linearly dependent sic vectors exist for @xmath8 , 5 or 7 , but we do find them again when @xmath9 , 9 and 12however , in these latter cases the linear dependencies are not uniquely tied to sics .",
    "additionally , we found an unexpected method of generating 2- and 3-dimensional sics from the linear dependencies among vectors in 6- and 9-dimensional sics , respectively",
    ". we do nt know whether this can be generalised to all dimensions divisible by 3 .",
    "we observe that the reverse of our problem  to show that there exists an open set of fiducials giving rise to wh orbits without linear dependencies  has been considered for signal processing purposes and has been solved in prime dimensions @xcite and more recently in all finite dimension @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we review some basic facts about the weyl - heisenberg and clifford groups , and explain notations and terminology used in the rest of the paper .",
    "section 3 introduces the hesse configuration and linear dependencies in sics in dimension 3 .",
    "section 4 proves that linear dependencies can always be found in wh orbits when the fiducial vector is an eigenvector of an order 3 unitary matrix . in dimensions divisible by 3 and dimensions equal to 8 mod 9",
    ", these wh orbits include sics .",
    "in section 5 , we give numerical results from our computer search for dependencies in dimensions 4 to 9 .",
    "we focus specifically on data relating to the sic case in dimensions 6 and 9 . in section 6 , we prove the sets of linearly dependent vectors in dimension 6 contain 2-dimensional sics and show that sets in dimension 9 contain 3-dimensional sics .",
    "we do not have data for dimension 12 or higher , so do not know whether this pattern continues for all dimensions divisible by 3 .",
    "in which case , this could open a new avenue for a sic existence proof .",
    "section 7 turns away from sics altogether and proves that linear dependencies will always arise in wh orbits with a fiducial vector invariant under a unitary matrix whose order is a non - trivial divisor of @xmath7 in dimensions where @xmath7 is a product of distinct prime numbers .",
    "we give an example of this using linear dependencies in even dimensions .",
    "section 8 relates our results to a recent representation of the clifford group @xcite .",
    "section 9 summarises our results and points at some possible clues for the sic existence problem .",
    "in this section we review some basic facts about the weyl - heisenberg ( wh ) and clifford groups which will be needed in the sequel . for more details see ( for example ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 be the standard basis in dimension @xmath7 .",
    "define the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath13 where addition of ket - labels is mod @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "the weyl - heisenberg displacement operators are then defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 . with this definition @xmath18 where the symplectic form @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath21 we then have @xmath22 and @xmath23 (",
    "note that if @xmath7 is even @xmath24 and @xmath25 implies @xmath26 ) .",
    "we define the weyl - heisenberg group to consist of all operators of the form @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the set @xmath31 equipped with arithmetic modulo @xmath32 ) .    in many situations",
    "the phase factor in the first of equations ( [ eq : dprd ] ) is not important .",
    "it is accordingly convenient to introduce the notation @xmath33 to signify that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are equal up to a phase .",
    "we then have @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 . neglecting phases in this way",
    "the wh group reduces to the @xmath0 operators @xmath39 ( in more technical language these facts can be expressed by the statement that the collineation group is @xmath40 ) .",
    "similarly , if we ignore phases then the orbit of a vector @xmath41 under the wh group reduces to the set @xmath42 ( in more technical language this set is the orbit of @xmath41 considered as an element of @xmath43 under the action of the collineation group ) . in the sequel , by an abuse of terminology",
    ", we shall refer to this set as the wh orbit of @xmath41 .",
    "the symplectic group @xmath44 consists of all matrices @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( mod @xmath32 ) . to each such matrix",
    "there corresponds a unitary @xmath51 , unique up to a phase , such that @xmath52 if @xmath47 is relatively prime to @xmath32 we have the explicit formula @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the multiplicative inverse of @xmath47 ( mod @xmath32 ) and @xmath55 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "if @xmath47 is not relatively prime to @xmath32 we use the fact  @xcite that @xmath56 has the decomposition @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 both are relatively prime to @xmath32 so that @xmath60 , @xmath61 can be calculated using equation  ( [ eq : ufdef ] ) .",
    "@xmath51 is then given by @xmath62 up to an arbitrary phase .",
    "we shall refer to unitaries of the form @xmath63 as symplectic unitaries .",
    "the clifford group then consists of all products @xmath64 .",
    "we have @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction it turns out that every known wh sic fiducial vector is an eigenvector of a canonical order @xmath67 clifford unitary and , conversely , that in every dimension where an exhaustive search has been made every canonical order @xmath67 clifford unitary has a sic fiducial vector as one of its eigenvectors  @xcite . in these statements",
    "the term `` canonical order @xmath67 clifford unitary '' refers to a unitary of the form @xmath68 where @xmath37 is arbitrary and @xmath69 is any element of @xmath44 with the property @xmath70 if @xmath71 one needs to impose the additional requirement that @xmath72 .",
    "it is then guaranteed that , with a suitable choice of the phase @xmath55 , @xmath73 is order @xmath67 .",
    "the matrix @xmath69 is always conjugate  @xcite , either to the zauner matrix @xmath74 or its square or , in the case of dimensions @xmath75 with @xmath76 , to the matrix @xmath77 in this paper we will confine ourselves to the case of fiducials which are eigenvectors of @xmath78 .",
    "choosing the phase in equation  ( [ eq : ufdef ] ) to be @xmath79 one finds  @xcite that the eigenvalues of @xmath78 are @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "we denote the three corresponding eigenspaces as @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , and give their dimensions in table 1 .",
    ".multiplicities of the eigenvalues of @xmath78 for different dimensions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next we define three new operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 as follows .",
    "@xmath86 note that @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the same linear span .",
    "we will prove that @xmath89 implies @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and that @xmath92 implies @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "from that one can prove that the span is 2-dimensional .",
    "the following properties of @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be derived straightforwardly from their definitions : @xmath95 @xmath96 moreover , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are rank-3 projection operators , and they are orthogonal to each other .",
    "one can also verify the following commutation relations between @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 these equations tell us how @xmath102 and @xmath85 permute the eigenspaces of @xmath100 . for example , if @xmath103 is an eigenvector of @xmath100 with eigenvalue @xmath104 , then @xmath105 , so @xmath106 is an eigenvector of @xmath100 with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "the full action of @xmath107 and @xmath85 on the eigenspaces of @xmath100 is described in figure 2 ( @xmath108 commutes with @xmath100 so it simply leaves the eigenspaces invariant ) .",

    "let @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 be non - zero eigenvectors of @xmath109 belonging to the eigenspaces @xmath122 , @xmath114 , @xmath116 , @xmath111 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "except for @xmath117 , the rest of them are unique up to a scalar , because the corresponding eigenspaces are 1-dimensional .",
    "as seen from the diagram , we have @xmath123 .",
    "we are going to prove that @xmath124 , so that @xmath90 for any @xmath89 .",
    "suppose otherwise , that @xmath125 .",
    "it has to be the case that @xmath126 ( for any choice of @xmath117 ) , because otherwise @xmath127 will be a non - zero vector in @xmath113 , which is 1-dimensional , which implies @xmath128 for some non - zero @xmath46 , and therefore @xmath129 , contradicting the assumption that @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath130 is a non - zero vector in @xmath116 , which is 1-dimensional , we must also have @xmath131 for some non - zero @xmath47 , and therefore @xmath132 so from the assumption that @xmath125 , we have obtained @xmath133 , which implies @xmath134 , which means that @xmath135 is orthogonal to the 4-dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath110 , @xmath114 and @xmath116 .",
    "this contradicts @xmath98 being a rank-3 projection operator .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath136 , and that @xmath90 for any @xmath89 .",
    "the identity @xmath91 immediately follows from @xmath137 .",

    "@xmath141 is not proportional to @xmath103 because @xmath141 lies in @xmath112 and @xmath103 lies in @xmath115 .",
    "therefore @xmath103 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath141 indeed fully span a 2-dimensional subspace .",
    "it s a similar argument to show that @xmath144 , which implies @xmath145 and @xmath146 for any @xmath92 .",
    "we can thus explain the occurrence of the @xmath147-dimensional sics one finds when @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , one ca nt explain the @xmath67-dimensional sics one finds when @xmath148 in the same way .",
    "if one uses the construction described in the proof of theorem  4 when @xmath148 one obtains 9 vectors which do not belong to a @xmath67-dimensional subspace and for which the overlaps are not constant ( they actually take two different values ) .",
    "the construction also fails to produce sics in dimensions @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we summarise the situation in table  5 , which shows the dimensionality of the subspace spanned by the @xmath0 vectors obtained using the construction of theorem  4 as a function of the eigenspace from which @xmath41 is chosen .",
    "nevertheless , the fact remains that if , in dimension @xmath151 , instead of arbitrarily choosing a vector in @xmath115 or @xmath83 as in theorem  4 , one starts from an arbitrarily chosen fiducial vector @xmath41 in the zauner subspace ( not necessarily a sic fiducial ) , then one always does find @xmath67-dimensional sics among the normal vectors to the linearly dependent sets generated by @xmath41 .",
    "if this phenomenon repeated in higher dimensions it would open up the intriguing possibility that one might be able to get a proof of sic existence in this way .",

    "we have been focussing so far on the zauner unitary because , along with its conjugates , it is the symplectic unitary which appears to be relevant to the sic existence problem .",
    "however , there are many other symplectic unitaries which give rise to linear dependencies , as we now show .    before proceeding",
    "further we need to take account of a subtlety which is important in even dimensions .",
    "suppose @xmath7 is even , so that @xmath154 .",
    "given @xmath155 let @xmath156 be @xmath69 reduced mod @xmath7 .",

    "2 .   the @xmath7-order of @xmath69 to be the order of @xmath157 considered as an element of @xmath158 .",

    "we showed that @xmath188 for some @xmath179 .",
    "for that value of @xmath179 the vectors @xmath189 are linearly dependent , implying that the vectors @xmath190 are linearly dependent .    as an illustration of this theorem",

    "the situation is more interesting if the dimension is a square number , @xmath273 . for this case",
    "it has recently been shown that there exists a choice of basis in which the entire clifford group is represented by monomial matrices , i.e. by permutation matrices in which the unit entries have been replaced by phase factors @xcite .",

    "moreover , one sees by inspection that the vector @xmath284 is left invariant by the full symplectic group whenever @xmath7 is odd . in this sense",
    "the monomial basis is a distant cousin of the ` special sic ' in three dimensions  or perhaps of the mub in three dimensions .",

    "since the wh group contains @xmath7 diagonal elements ( namely the elements of the subgroup generated by @xmath275 and @xmath276 ) this means that the wh orbit generated from a fiducial vector in @xmath290 contains @xmath7 vectors confined to a subspace orthogonal to one of the vectors in the monomial basis .",
    "since the entire wh group is given by monomial matrices the orbit can be divided into @xmath7 such linearly dependent sets , spanning @xmath7 subspaces each orthogonal to a vector in the monomial basis . in particular this",
    "applies to the known sics in these dimensions .",
    "a similar argument applies if @xmath291 .",
    "we consider the symplectic matrix @xmath292 after adjusting the arbitrary phase so that @xmath293 and so that the largest eigenspace corresponds to the eigenvalue 1 , we find that @xmath294 has two diagonal non - zero elements , one equal to 1 and the other equal to @xmath295 .",
    "following the same logic as above we see that every wh orbit that includes a fiducial invariant under @xmath294 must be divided into @xmath7 linearly dependent sets of @xmath7 vectors orthogonal to one of the vectors in the monomial basis",
    ".    variants of this argument can be used also if the dimension is @xmath296 , where @xmath179 is any integer . in this case",
    "the hilbert space splits into a direct sum of @xmath297 copies of a @xmath179-dimensional hilbert space , and there exists a representation of the clifford group in which every group element acts within and permutes these subspaces @xcite .",
    "this representation is @xmath179-nomial , in the sense that it is given by a permutation matrix of size @xmath297 in which the unit entries have been replaced by matrices of size @xmath179 .",
    "for instance , one finds in dimension eight that any vector in the smallest eigenspace of the zauner unitary has two zero entries , and again there will be linear dependencies in a wh orbit arising from a fiducial in this eigenspace .",
    "a sic fiducial does in fact exist in this eigenspace @xcite .",
    "the hesse configuration singles out ` special sics ' in dimension 3 by the higher number of linear dependencies among their vectors .",
    "we searched for similar patterns in higher dimensions through exhaustive numerical searches for sets of @xmath7 linearly dependent vectors in sics in dimensions @xmath8 to 8 and partial searches in dimensions @xmath148 and 12 . in dimension 8",
    ", the sics with fiducials in the smallest subspace of the zauner unitary , @xmath83 , also stand out for exhibiting a higher number of linear dependencies than other wh orbits with a fiducial vector from the same subspace .",
    "this could extend the dimension 3 connection between elliptic curves and sics ( which gives rise to the hesse configuration ) to dimension 8 and , as sic fiducials always lie in @xmath83 for dimensions equal to 8 mod 9 , possibly to an infinite family of dimensions .    in the dimensions we looked at , sets of @xmath7 sic vectors",
    "are usually linearly independent .",
    "we proved that it is always possible to find dependencies in sics for dimensions divisible by 3 ( where the sic fiducials sit in @xmath112 ) and for dimensions equal to 8 mod 9 ( where the sic fiducials sit in @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , this dependency structure in dimensions divisible by 3 also occurs for any wh orbit when the fiducial vector is taken from @xmath112 and so is not a property uniquely tied to sics .",
    "we also proved that linear dependencies will arise for wh orbits whose fiducial vector is in @xmath112 for dimensions @xmath298 ; wh orbits whose fiducial vector is in @xmath115 for dimensions @xmath298 and @xmath299 ; and wh orbits whose fiducial vector is in @xmath83 for all dimensions .",
    "these theorems do not account for all the linear dependencies ; our numerical results often revealed a higher number of linearly dependent sets of vectors than the theorems predict .",
    "looking in detail at linear dependencies in dimension 6 revealed some surprising structure .",
    "firstly , the normal vectors ( i.e. the vectors orthogonal to each 5-dimensional subspace spanned by 6 linearly dependent vectors ) collect into orthogonal sets of 4 when the hw orbit is a sic .",
    "when the orbit is not a sic , these normal vectors lose their orthogonality pattern .",
    "secondly , the normal vectors of dependencies from both sics and non - sics form 30 2-dimensional sics .",
    "this repeats in dimension 9 , where some of the normal vectors form 3-dimensional sics .",
    "we did not find 4-dimensional sics from normal vectors in dimension 12 , but our search was not exhaustive and we can not rule out their existence either .",
    "we also proved a number of theorems for linear dependencies using unitaries other than the zauner unitary .",
    "our results represent the beginning of a theory for when linear dependencies occur in wh orbits .",
    "this is of interest in itself .",
    "also , just possibly , they may contain an important clue for the sic existence problem .",
    "ib and kb thank markus grassl for taking an interest in this problem when we visited singapore , and especially for drawing our attention to the linear dependencies in the `` odd '' sic in eight dimensions .",
