    "charm spectroscopy has revived since 2000 .",
    "many new excited charmed baryon states have been discovered by cleo , babar , belle and fermilab .",
    "masses of ground states as well as many of their excitations are known experimentally with rather good precision .",
    "however charmed baryons have narrow widths and non of their spin or parity are measured except the @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the assignments listed in the pdg book almost are based on quark model@xcite . theoretically , the study of heavy baryons has a long story@xcite .",
    "heavy baryons provide a laboratory to study the dynamics of the light quarks in the environment of heavy quark , such as their chiral symmetry@xcite .",
    "the studies of heavy baryons also help us to understand the nonperturbative qcd@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it really is an ideal place for studying the dynamics of diquark .",
    "the concept of diquark appeared soon after the original papers on quarks@xcite .",
    "it was used to calculate the hadron properties . in heavy quark",
    "effective theory , two light quarks often refer to as diquark , which is treated as particle in parallel with quark itself .",
    "there are several phenomenal manifestations of diquark : the @xmath2 mass difference , the isospin @xmath3 rule , the structure function ratio of neutron to proton , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in this diquark picture ,",
    "charmed baryons are composed of one diquark and one charm quark .",
    "selem and wilczek@xcite have generalized the famous chew - frautschi formula by considering diquark and quark connected by a relativistic string with constant tension @xmath4 and rotating with angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the string is responsible for the color confinement and is also called as loaded flux tube if the two ends get masses . in the limit of zero diquark and quark masses ,",
    "the usual chew - frautschi relationship @xmath6 appears .",
    "they have investigated the @xmath7 spectrum and concluded that  large @xmath5 spectroscopy would give convincing evidence for energetically significant diquark correlations \" @xcite . in hadrons containing one heavy quark ,",
    "diquark ought to be a better approximation than in hadrons containing only light quarks . however selem and wilczek have given only a short discussion on the @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "in this paper , we accept the diquark concept and use their relativistic string model to study the charmed baryon spectroscopy .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce firstly the diquarks and the string model in section [ model ] .",
    "we give our analysis of the doublets and give the quantum number assignments based on diquark assumption .",
    "numerical results are showed in section [ numerical ] . in the end summary and discussion",
    "are given .",
    "the single - charmed baryons composed of one diquark and one charm quark . in literatures , there are two kinds of diquarks : the good diquark with spin zero and the bad diquark with spin one .",
    "the good diquark is more favorable energetically than the bad one , which is indicated by both the one - gluon exchange and instanton calculations . in @xmath9 , the good",
    "diquark has flavor - spin symmetry @xmath10 while the bad diquark @xmath11 . to give a color singlet state , both kinds of diquark have the same color symmetry @xmath12 . in the following we use the @xmath13 $ ] to denote a good diquark , while @xmath14 the bad and @xmath15 to denote either @xmath16 quark or @xmath17 quark .    in this diquark picture",
    ", @xmath8 has a @xmath18 $ ] component , while @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 . for @xmath23 , either kind of diquarks , good or bad , can be formed .",
    "heavy baryons always have been obtained by continuum production@xcite .",
    "so , the lowest baryons discovered are more likely to be ground states .",
    "these are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "three doublets @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 would also be states with @xmath29 , if they are composed of bad diquark and charm quark .",
    "and we assign the doublets @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the good diquark with spin zero has no spin interaction with the charm quark .",
    "so , the lowest energy is a singlet .",
    "only the @xmath33 coupling may make the energy split@xcite : @xmath34)=\\mathcal{k}_{[qq^\\prime]}2\\vec{l}\\cdot \\vec{s_c},\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath35 depends on the diquark and charm quark masses .",
    "this interaction splits baryon with orbital angular momentum l to baryons with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "and the parity is @xmath38 . for the bad diquark ,",
    "the spin - spin interaction is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spin of the bad diquark , and the coefficient @xmath41 depends on the diquark and charm quark masses .",
    "this spin - spin interaction also lead to a doublet in the spectrum .",
    "since in our assignments , there is no @xmath42 multiplet of bad diquark and for simplicity , we will not discuss the splitting caused by @xmath33 coupling for baryons containing bad diquark .",
    "we have relation @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to deduce the mass difference of a doublet .",
    "for example , when @xmath45 , @xmath46 , they are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being @xmath50 or @xmath51 . taking a doublet as input , we can obtain the @xmath49 and @xmath52 .",
    "and it is not the masses of the doublet , but this @xmath52 which enter into the string model .      in 1960",
    "chew and frautschi conjectured that the strongly interacting particles fall into families where the regge trajectory functions were straight lines : @xmath53 with the same constant @xmath54 for all the trajectories .",
    "the straight - line regge trajectories with @xmath55 zero were later understood as arising from massless endpoints on rotating relativistic strings at speed of light transversely .",
    "a non - zero values of @xmath55 may include zero - point energy for string vibrations and loaded endpoints .    in selem and wilczek s model@xcite ,",
    "the two ends of the string have masses @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , with constant string tension @xmath4 .",
    "the rotaing angular momentum is @xmath5 with angular velocity @xmath58 . if the diquark and charm quark are away from the center of rotation at distances @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the energy of the system is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the usual lorentz factor : @xmath63 the angular momentum can be written as : @xmath64 furthermore , we have formula relating the tension and the angular velocity : @xmath65    from equation ( [ eq : t ] ) , we see that @xmath66 can be replaced by @xmath67 , @xmath62 and @xmath68 . solving the equations ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : t ] )",
    ", we can express the @xmath62 by @xmath68 and @xmath67 : @xmath69 now , we have two equations , ( [ eq : e ] ) and([eq : l ] ) , and 6 parameters , @xmath70 , @xmath5 , @xmath56 , @xmath71 , @xmath4 and @xmath58 .",
    "these equations are more useful than the chew - frautschi formula for they make us able to extract the diquark masses .    for very light mass , it appears that @xmath72 as @xmath73 and the chew - frautschi relationship is recovered as @xmath74 . for other cases , such as",
    "the first corrections at small masses see ref.@xcite . a reduced formula has being used to study the charmed meson spectroscopy@xcite.in this paper we will solve the equations numerically .",
    "we chose @xmath32 doublet as input to solve the equations ( [ eq : e ] ) and ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "firstly , we take the @xmath76 and @xmath4 as free parameters to get the diquark mass .",
    "the string tension @xmath4 is universal for baryons with the same components .",
    "then we use these three parameters to give energy predictions for @xmath77 .",
    "and we find that the @xmath4 is almost equal for @xmath8 and @xmath23 if we choose the value which give a linear regge trajectory @xmath78 or linear @xmath79 .",
    "the last relation was given by selem and wilczek , which can be obtained by expanding the right hands of equations ( [ eq : e ] ) and ( [ eq : l ] ) in @xmath80 for terms of light diquark and in @xmath81 for terms of charm quark . the results are listed in table [ tab : lambda ] and [ tab : xi ] .",
    "the two kinds trajectories are both linear since the energies for @xmath82 at @xmath83 form a arithmetic progression and with small common difference .",
    "we plot the two kinds trajectories with @xmath84 @xmath85 for example , on figure [ fig : el ] and [ fig : eml ] .     for @xmath8 and @xmath23 with @xmath86 @xmath85 and @xmath87 .",
