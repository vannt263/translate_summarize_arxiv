    "most elements heavier than he are produced by stellar evolution and then distributed into interstellar space . understanding the chemical composition of distant galaxies is therefore crucial to understanding the star formation and feedback processes central to galaxy evolution .",
    "absorption lines of dla and sub - dla absorbers in the spectra of background quasars provide the most sensitive tools to measure the heavy element content of distant galaxies .",
    "the dlas have neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath1 @xmath2 , and the sub - dlas have @xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "the dlas and sub - dlas dominate the neutral gas content of galaxies , and constitute most of the h  i available for star formation at redshifts @xmath4 [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "dlas observed toward grb afterglows also offer an excellent probe of the physical and chemical conditions in distant galaxies [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "besides neutral hydrogen , dlas and sub - dlas also show a number of other elements ranging from c to zn .",
    "the abundances of these elements provide very sensitive indicators of the chemical evolution of galaxies [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "since different elements are produced by stars of different masses , the measurements of element abundances as a function of time give information about the history of formation of stars of different masses in galaxies .",
    "the quality of the atomic data directly affect the accuracy of the element abundances and physical properties of galaxies that are estimated from the measurements of absorption lines .",
    "the most commonly used atomic data reference for the analysis of absorption lines in dlas and sub - dlas is @xcite [ see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a need to improve beyond the oscillator strengths of @xcite .",
    "this is because morton ( 2003 ) lists large uncertainties for the oscillator strengths of some important transitions .",
    "[ these uncertainty values are listed on the nist atomic spectra database @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , for some transitions , @xcite lists no oscillator strengths at all . in some cases , the nist database assigns low accuracy grades even for more recent values obtained since @xcite .",
    "such shortcomings in atomic data limit our ability to interpret the spectra of high - redshift galaxies , potentially leading to erroneous inferences about their chemical enrichment and star formation history .    with the goal of producing new reliable atomic data for commonly used astrophysical ions ,",
    "we have started a collaborative study combining atomic physics , plasma simulations , and observational spectroscopy .",
    "the goals of this study are to examine the quality of available atomic data , to improve the accuracy of the atomic data with low reported accuracies , to incorporate these new atomic data into cloudy ( our widely utilized plasma simulation code ) , and to study the effect of the revised cloudy code on the analysis of absorption lines in dlas and sub - dlas . in a recent study ( kisielius et al .",
    "2014 ) , we examined the atomic data for the key ion . here",
    "we focus on the ion , which also plays a very important role in studies of dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "refractory elements such as fe , si , or mg condense in the form of solid dust grains in the interstellar medium . on the other hand , volatile elements such as n , o , p , s , ar , zn do not condense appreciably on interstellar dust grains .",
    "the gas - phase abundances of such weakly depleted elements can therefore give their total ( gas + solid phase ) abundances .",
    "for observations of dlas and sub - dlas , weak , unsaturated lines of the elements n , o , p , or ar are often not accessible in ground - based spectroscopy , which makes it difficult to measure their column densities reliably . moreover , the abundance of n appears to be complicated by nucleosynthetic differences between primary and secondary n production [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the two elements that have emerged as the most useful for dla / sub - dla studies are s and zn . having discussed the atomic data for s in @xcite , we now turn to zn .",
    "zn is especially interesting because it tracks fe closely in galactic stars ( for [ fe / h ] @xmath5 ) .",
    "especially important among the zn ions is , which is the dominant ion in dlas .",
    "a key advantage of is that it has two weak absorption lines in a relatively narrow wavelength region at @xmath6 , that are often unsaturated and hence allow accurate column density determinations .",
    "moreover , these lines often lie outside the lyman-@xmath7 forest , and therefore allow unambiguous identifications and measurements free of blends .",
    "this has made zn the most commonly used metallicity indicator for dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "starting from the early work of @xcite and @xcite , zn has been observed in @xmath8 dlas and @xmath9 sub - dlas at redshifts ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "zn has also been used as a metallicity indicator in studies of the milky way interstellar gas .",
    "for all of these reasons , accurate atomic data for transitions are very important .",
    "@xcite lists the oscillator strengths of 0.501 and 0.246 for the @xmath12 lines , respectively , but there are no estimates of the uncertainties in these values in the nist database .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the metallicity introduced by the uncertainty in the oscillator strengths could be far larger than those often quoted from the measurement uncertainties in high - resolution data ( typically @xmath13 dex ) .",
    "has additional absorption lines at 923.98 , 938.71 , 949.46 , 984.14 , and 986.52  , but they are listed in morton ( 2003 ) without any oscillator strength estimates .",
    "there is quite a generous amount of either experimental or theoretical studies considering the transition wavelengths , radiative transitions or scattering processes in the ion , see , e.g. , experimental works of @xcite .",
    "multiconfiguration hartree - fock calculations were reported by @xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation adopting transformed radial orbitals was used by @xcite to calculate oscillator strengths of astrophysically important lines in and ions .",
    "their calculations which included core - polarization effects produced oscillator strengths which agreed quite well with previously published semiempirical values .",
    "recently @xcite have presented a pivotal study of oscillator strengths for the .",
    "they have investigated the 4s4p resonance line oscillator strengths in the ion using extensive configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations .",
    "they studied the influence of core - polarization , electron - correlation in the core , core - core correlation effects in resulting oscillator strengths using civ3 computer code which deals with relativistic effects in breit - pauli approximation .",
    "their determined oscillator strength values , @xmath14 for the @xmath15 line and @xmath16 for the @xmath17 line lie about @xmath18 higher than the recent experimental values obtained by @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical @xmath21 values of @xcite are in good agreement with relativistic many - body perturbation theory calculation results of @xcite , which are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for these lines .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite have considered only 4s ",
    "4p lines , therefore their data are not enough for a comprehensive modeling calculations and can not be employed in our investigation .",
    "very recently @xcite published new calculations of atomic data for the ion .",
    "their calculations were performed using two different semi - empirical methods , the weakest bound electron potential model theory ( wbepmt)and the quantum defect orbital theory ( qdot ) .",
    "they employed numerical coulomb approximation wave functions and numerical non - relativistic hartree - fock wave functions to determine the necessary parameters . as a result ,",
    "the real multi - particle system was transformed to a simple one - particle system . in the wbepmt case ,",
    "the effective parameters ( nuclear charge @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) were derived from the experimental energy data or from other existing calculations for the mean radius @xmath27 .",
    "one can have a reasonable doubt if these @xmath27 values , derived from the different sources , are really coherent and consistent .",
    "unfortunately , their suitability for the 4s electrons is very questionable as their wavefunctions significantly overlap with those of other electrons . as a result ,",
    "the results from these two different approximations differ quite significantly one from another even if they both are semi - empirical and based on the same experimental data .",
    "several works have considered electron - impact excitation parameters for the ion .",
    "scattering parameters for some transitions in this ion were determined by @xcite by employing r - matrix methods in the @xmath28-coupling approximation . @xcite",
    "have applied a fully relativistic distorted - wave theory to study the electron - impact excitation of the @xmath29 resonance transitions in singly - charged metal ions with one valence electron , including zn@xmath30 ions .",
    "unfortunately , the above - mentioned studies did not produce atomic data sets suitable for spectral modeling where the complete and consistent data are required .    in order to assess the accuracy of the zn ii atomic data",
    ", we performed new calculations of the oscillator strengths for all electric dipole , magnetic dipole , and electric quadrupole transitions .",
    "section 2 describes our new calculations and how they compare with previous estimates .",
    "section 3 outlines the inclusion of these calculations into cloudy and gives a few examples of applications .",
    "finally , section 4 summarizes our results and their implications for abundance studies of dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "our calculations are performed by employing hartree - fock radial orbitals ( hfro ) .",
    "the relativistic corrections are included in the breit - pauli approximation .",
    "we determine spectral parameters for four even configurations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and for three odd configurations @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . the configuration @xmath37 levels lie in an energy range which is significantly wider compared to the purpose of this work .",
    "for that reason we determine only the lowest levels of this configuration arising from the @xmath38 and @xmath39 electrons bound into @xmath40 term . the electron - correlation effects are included in the configuration interaction ( ci ) approximation by adopting the basis of transformed radial orbitals ( tro ) described by @xcite .    at the first step , we solve the hf equations for the ground configuration using the code of @xcite .",
    "next , we determine solutions of hf equations @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 orbitals in a frozen - core potential . this basis of hfro is complemented with transformed radial orbitals @xmath45 , which are introduced to describe virtual electron excitations from adjusted ( investigated ) configurations .",
    "the tro are obtained by a way of transformation :    @xmath46    the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are introduced to ensure the maximum of the mean energy corrections determined in the second - order perturbation theory ( pt ) ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "the factor @xmath49 ensures the normalization of the tros , which are determined for the electrons with the principal quantum number values @xmath50 and for all allowed values of the orbital quantum number @xmath51 .",
    "the set of admixed configurations is generated from the adjusted configurations by introducing one - electron and two - electron excitations from the 3p , 3d , 4s , 4p , 4d , and 5s shells to all available states in the basis of determined radial orbitals .",
    "this leads to a huge set of admixed configurations and , consequently , to large hamiltonian matrices . in order to reduce the size of the hamiltonian matrices to be diagonalized",
    ", we need to determine the most significant configurations . as a selection criterion , we use the averaged weights @xmath52 of the admixed configurations",
    "@xmath53 in the ci wavefunction expansion of the adjusted configuration @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 describes all possible intermediate momenta , which bound the non - relativistic configurations @xmath57 and @xmath58 into @xmath28 multiplet .",
    "these averaged weights are determined in the second - order pt .",
    "we select only those configurations which have their weights larger than some selection criterion @xmath59 .",
    "more details on configuration selection procedure are given by @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind restrictions of our computer system , we can perform our spectroscopic data generation for @xmath60 .",
    "the main limiting factor is the size @xmath61 of the electrostatic interaction operator @xmath62 which depends on the number of configuration state functions ( csf ) having the same total momenta @xmath28 .",
    "we have performed two other similar test calculations with the value of @xmath59 increased by a factor of two ( ci@xmath63 ) and by a factor of ten ( ci@xmath64 ) . in the further description we present the parameters of these three calculations separated by a slash . in that way",
    "we can demonstrate the convergence of our calculated results .",
    "for the four even configurations investigated , we have selected the most important @xmath65 non - relativistic configurations , including adjusted ones , which give rise to @xmath66 configuration state functions ( csf ) . here",
    "we apply csf reduction by moving the shells of virtually excited electrons to the beginning of active shells , as it was described in detail by @xcite .",
    "this procedure reduces the number of csfs to @xmath67 .",
    "using this basis , the size of the largest @xmath62 matrix is @xmath68 .",
    "for the three odd configurations investigated , we have selected @xmath69 most important configurations , including the adjusted ones .",
    "these configurations make @xmath70 csfs , which in turn are further reduced by the csf - reduction procedure to @xmath71 . adopting this base",
    ", the size of largest @xmath62 matrix reaches @xmath72 .",
    "the hamiltonian eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are determined adopting this reduced configuration basis .",
    "further , the determined ci wavefunctions are employed to calculate electron transition parameters .",
    "the m1 and e2 radiative transition data are produced for transitions among the levels of the same - parity configurations , and the e1 , m2 , and e3 transition parameters are produced for the radiative transitions among the levels of the different - parity configurations .",
    "the significance of the radiative transitions of higher multipole order , such as m2 or e3 , for the radiative lifetimes of some levels was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "following the methods of @xcite , we also produce electron - impact excitation collision strengths in the plane - wave born approximation",
    ". the most inclusive description of the adopted approach is given by @xcite , whereas its application for data production and their accuracy analysis is given by @xcite .    to perform our calculations ,",

    "one of the motivations behind our interest in the atomic data stems from the somewhat surprising results obtained from observations of lines in dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "we now describe these results and discuss the implications of our revised atomic data for the evolution of dlas/ sub - dlas .",

    "surprisingly , dlas at @xmath120 evolve little if at all , with metallicities far below the predictions of models based on the cosmic star formation history [ e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the dla global mean metallicity shows some evolution at high z , but seems to reach only about @xmath121 of the solar level by @xmath122 .",
    "these results appear to contradict the near - solar mass - weighted mean metallicity at @xmath119 predicted by most models and observed in nearby galaxies .",
    "equally surprising , a significant fraction of sub - dlas appear to be highly metal - rich ( near - solar or super - solar ) , even at redshifts @xmath123 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the super - solar metallicities observed in many sub - dlas ( a large fraction of which are derived from zn ) are particularly striking , because no local counterparts to such systems are known among normal galaxies .    given these surprising results , it is natural to ask to what extent the results are affected by ionization of the absorbing gas .",
    "ionization corrections are likely to be especially important for sub - dlas and low-@xmath124 dlas .",
    "cloudy calculations using existing atomic data suggest that the low-@xmath125 sub - dlas can be significantly ionized , but give relatively small ionization corrections to the abundances ( @xmath126_{total } -[x\\,ii /[h\\,i]}$ ] ) over the range of ionization parameters ( @xmath127 , where @xmath128 denotes the flux of radiation with h@xmath129 13.6 ev and @xmath130 denotes the total gas density ) allowed by observed ratios such as / , / , or / [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .    to illustrate the effect of ionization , we now show the cloudy photoionization modeling calculations for a few illustrative absorbers .",
