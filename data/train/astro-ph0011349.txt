    "ic4846 ( png027.6@xmath409.6 ) is a compact planetary nebula ( pn ) whose morphology has not been studied in detail yet .",
    "the only available information on its structure is provided by the vla 6 cm continuum observations by kwok ( 1985 , see also aaquist & kwok 1990 ) , showing several knots embedded in a faint elongated structure of @xmath1 3@xmath52 arcsec@xmath6 in size .",
    "the h@xmath7 surface brightness ( @xmath8 , acker et al . 1992 ) suggests that ic4846 has a high electron density .",
    "this is corroborated by the small [ s  ii]@xmath96717,@xmath96731 doublet ratio ( barker 1978 ; acker et al .",
    "1992 ) which reaches the limiting ratio for high electron density ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) .",
    "both its small angular size and high density indicate that ic4846 is a young pn .",
    "the line intensity ratios ( acker et al . 1992 ) point to a moderate excitation ( [ n  ii]@xmath96583/h@xmath12 , [ o  iii]@xmath94959/h@xmath13 , and very faint he  ii @xmath94686 ) .",
    "_ iue _ low - resolution uv spectra of the central star show a strong p - cygni profile in the n  v line with a terminal velocity of @xmath1 1300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the occurrence of a strong stellar wind in the central stars of pne is indicative of their early evolutionary stage ( cerruti - sola & perinotto 1985 ) .",
    "the shaping processes of pne occur early in their formation .",
    "therefore , the signatures of these processes in the nebula are more recent and more likely to have withstood the fast nebular evolution in young pne .",
    "this turns the observations of young pne of chief importance in the understanding of their formation mechanisms .",
    "accordingly , ic4846 was included in our observational program of compact young pne ( see miranda 1999 and references therein ) , and narrow  band h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] images and long  slit high  resolution spectra were obtained to study its structure and internal kinematics .",
    "the results reported in this paper evidence the existence of bipolar , precessing collimated outflows in ic4846 .",
    "direct images of ic4846 were obtained in 1997 july 24 with the nordic optical telescope ( not ) at roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma .",
    "the detector was a loral 15 @xmath14 m ccd at the hirac camera providing a plate scale of 0.11 arcsecpixel@xmath2 .",
    "the filters were h@xmath0 ( @xmath15 6563  , fwhm @xmath1 10  ) , and [ n  ii ] ( @xmath15 6584  , fwhm @xmath1 10  ) .",
    "exposure times were 900s in each case .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath1 1 arcsec .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and flat  fielded following standard procedures within midas package .",
    "long  slit echelle spectra of ic4846 were taken with the iacub spectrograph at the not in 1998 august 2 .",
    "the detector was a thompson 19 @xmath14 m ccd with 1024@xmath51024 pixels .",
    "a filter was used to isolate the h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]@xmath96583 emission lines in the 9@xmath16 echelle order .",
    "a thorium  argon spectrum was taken after each object spectrum for wavelength calibration purposes .",
    "exposure time was 1800s for each spectrum .",
    "the observed position angles ( pas ) were 11@xmath17 , 30@xmath17 , 54@xmath17 , and 140@xmath17 with the slit centered on the object .",
    "the dispersion was 2.5   mm@xmath2 , and the achieved spectral resolution ( fwhm ) @xmath1 7.5 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath1 1.5 arcsec .",
    "absolute errors in the radial velocity are @xmath18 1.5 kms@xmath2 , whereas relative errors ( within each long - slit spectrum ) are @xmath18 0.5 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures for long  slit spectroscopy within the iraf and midas packages .",
    "thereafter the [ n  ii]@xmath96583 emission line will be referred to as the [ n  ii ] line .",
    "figures  1 and 2 present grey  scale and contour maps , respectively , of ic4846 in the light of [ n  ii ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "the morphology of ic4846 , resolved in these images for the first time , displays a great wealth of structures . at the lowest intensity levels ,",
    "the appearance of the nebula is elliptical with two bipolar features protruding at pa @xmath1 54@xmath17 .",
    "these features , denoted a1a2 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , are curved filaments enhanced in [ n  ii ] . a second , inner ellipse , observed in h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] at intermediate intensity levels , can be recognized with its major axis at pa @xmath1 11@xmath17 .",
    "two compact knots , b1b2 , are observed at the tips of this inner ellipse .",
    "the innermost regions of ic4846 are dominated in [ n  ii ] at the highest intensity levels by two bright structures , c1c2 , which are not clearly distinguished in the h@xmath0 image .",
    "an additional attached circular shell with a size of @xmath1 10@xmath19 can also be identified in the h@xmath0 image .    in order to emphasize the different structures of ic4846 described before",
    ", we have obtained deconvolved images using the lucy - richardson algorithm as implemented in the midas package . deconvolved h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] images to a resolution of @xmath1 0.5 arcsec ( obtained with 30 iterations )",
    "are also presented in fig .  2 .",
    "these images clearly show the structural richness of the nebula .",
    "in particular , the curvature and filamentary appearance of a1a2 can easily be recognized as well as the compactness of b1b2 .",
    "c1c2 appear as point ",
    "symmetric structures elongated perpendicular to the radial direction from the center . in h@xmath0 the inner regions appear as an arc with an asymmetric intensity distribution .",
    "we note that the inner regions of the nebula resemble the morphology observed at 6 cm ( kwok 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , the inner shell presents a very low ellipticity .",
    "figure  3 shows position  velocity ( pv ) contour maps of the high resolution long  slit spectra of the [ n  ii ] emission line at pas 11@xmath17 , 54@xmath17 and 140@xmath17 .",
    "the spectrum at pa 30@xmath17 is similar to that at pa 11@xmath17 and is not shown here .",
    "the bipolar features a1a2 , b1b2 and c1c2 can be identified in the pv maps with point - symmetric pairs of components .",
    "we also note that no _ closed _ velocity ellipse can be identified in the pv maps of the [ n  ii ] emission line , which could be expected from the elliptical structures observed in the images . the h@xmath0 spectra ( not shown here )",
    "are dominated by emission from the inner regions .",
    "these regions show a tilt in the pv maps similar to the tilt of c1c2 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "a1a2 are clearly distinguished because of their high radial velocity .",
    "b1b2 seem to be present , too , although the h@xmath0 line is not useful for a detailed kinematic study owing its large thermal width .    a [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratio map",
    "is also presented in fig  1 .",
    "a1a2 and b1b2 are highlighted due to their relatively strong [ n  ii ] emission .",
    "c1c2 can also be recognized , although the line ratio seems to have lower values . a quantitative estimate of [ n",
    "ii]/h@xmath0 should be worked out using the long - slit spectra in order to single out both spatially and kinematically the different components .",
    "pv maps of the [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratio for pas 11@xmath17 and 54@xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    ". a mean value of [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 in the nebula of @xmath1 0.06 is obtained , similar to that obtained by acker et al .",
    "the three pairs present enhanced [ n  ii ] emission , with mean [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 values of @xmath1 0.8 ( a1a2 ) , @xmath1 0.15 ( b1b2 ) , and @xmath1 0.2 ( c1c2 ) , which are a factor 2.5 to 13 higher than the mean ratio in the nebula .",
    "furthermore , peak values of this ratio up to @xmath1 1.5 are found in a1a2 , and up to @xmath1 0.3 in b1b2 and c1c2 .",
    "common to all three pairs is that [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 peaks at larger distances from the center than the [ n  ii ] emission peaks ( see also fig .  1 ) .",
    "table  1 lists different parameters of the bipolar pairs as deduced from the [ n  ii ] images and long  slit spectra . in order to deduce systemic velocities ,",
    "we have first considered the centroid of each bipolar pair as representative of its own systemic velocity .",
    "the systemic velocity obtained for each pair is listed in table  1 .",
    "secondly , we have obtained the centroid velocity of the [ n  ii ] emission line as representative of the systemic velocity of the whole nebula . in order to avoid the contribution of the bipolar pairs",
    ", the centroid velocity was obtained from the middle point of the spatially integrated emission at 10% level of the intensity peak .",
    "we obtain v@xmath20(centroid ) @xmath1 168 kms@xmath2 and note that an identical value is obtained if the middle point is considered at 5% or 15% levels of the intensity peak .",
    "the values for v@xmath20(centroid ) , v@xmath20(b1b2 ) and v@xmath20(c1c2 ) agree within the absolute errors with the value quoted by bianchi ( 1992 ) and durand et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the systemic velocity of ic4846 .",
    "the systemic velocity of b1b2 and c1c2 are almost identical to each other ; both are slightly blueshifted ( @xmath1 3.5 kms@xmath2 ) with respect to the centroid velocity . in the case of a1a2",
    ", its systemic velocity is noticeably blueshifted by @xmath1 10 kms@xmath2 with respect to the centroid velocity .",
    "we will discuss in  4 possible interpretations for these systemic velocity shifts . in the following , radial velocities of each pair",
    "will be quoted with respect to its own systemic velocity .",
    "ic4846 displays three pairs of structures , a1a2 , b1b2 , and c1c2 , which are highly evocative of collimated outflows .",
    "we describe as follows the properties of these components .",
    "a1a2 appear detached and off - axis ( @xmath21(pa ) @xmath1 43@xmath17 ) with respect to the major axis of the inner ellipse .",
    "their orientation changes by @xmath1 5@xmath1710@xmath17 .",
    "a1a2 can be traced along @xmath1 6 arcsec , which represents a considerable fraction of the total nebular size .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath1 1 arcsec is obtained for their lateral size .",
    "the radial velocity systematically varies along a1a2 : a minimum velocity of @xmath1 @xmath18 36 kms@xmath2 is observed at the minimum angular distance ; the velocity then steadily increases with the distance up to @xmath1 @xmath18 52 kms@xmath2 ; finally , it slightly decreases at the tips of the features .",
    "the velocity width is small as compared with the velocity difference between a1 and a2 ( see table  1 ) , which implies a high degree of collimation .",
    "according to their properties , a1a2 are highly suggestive of a precessing bipolar jet .",
    "b1b2 present a rather moderate radial velocity and the velocity width is small and comparable to that of a1a2 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the small velocity width and the compactness indicate that b1b2 are highly collimated outflows .",
    "the radial velocity of c1c2 does not depend on the pa ( fig .  3 , table  1 ) , although some small variations ( @xmath1 7 kms@xmath2 ) within c1c2 are observed .",
    "possible interpretations of this pair will be discussed in  4 .",
    "the observations of ic4846 have disclosed a complex structure composed of three different elements : ( 1 ) two apparent elongated shells with different orientations , ( 2 ) an attached circular shell and ( 3 ) three pairs of point - symmetric components at different orientations with typical properties of collimated outflows . in the following we discuss about the nature , models and possible interpretations of these components .",
    "as already mentioned , there is no kinematic evidence for the elliptical shells in the pv maps of the [ n  ii ] line , although the extended emission observed in the pv maps may be related to these shells .",
    "we also note that the major axis of the outer ellipse is only defined by a1a2 .",
    "in fact , without a1a2 the outer ellipse could not be recognized .",
    "images at higher resolution would be necessary to elucidate the precise geometry of these shells . while a1a2 and b1b2 can be interpreted as precessing bipolar outflows , the interpretation of the pair c1c2 is somewhat difficult .",
    "its kinematic properties and the elongation perpendicular to the radial direction suggest that c1c2 could represent collimated ejections in which the orientation of the ejection axis has remarkably changed over the ejection time .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out that c1c2 represents a ring - like structure containing two bright opposite regions .",
    "the attached circular shell probably represents a previous slow wind ejected by the agb progenitor of ic4846 .",
    "it is similar to other attached shells observed in pne and its formation may be related to the dynamics of ionization fronts ( see mellema 1995 and references therein ) .    in the scenario that a1a2",
    "are precessing bipolar jets , we can obtain estimates for the inclination angle and velocity by assuming that the expansion velocity is constant and that the variation of the radial velocity is due to a systematic change of the angle between the observer and the precessing jet along a precession cone with aperture angle @xmath1 5@xmath1710@xmath17 .",
    "the observed minimum and maximum radial velocities are assumed to be related to the far and rear side of the precession cone , respectively . using the model for a biconical flow described by miranda & solf ( 1992 )",
    ", we obtain an inclination angle for the precession axis of @xmath1 13@xmath1726@xmath17 with respect to the plane of the sky , and a velocity of @xmath1 100190 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the ( mean ) kinematic age is @xmath1 200@xmath5d(kpc ) yr , where d is the distance to ic4846 , which is extremely uncertain with published values between 2 and 11 kpc ( see acker et al .",
    "the images also show that a1a2 protrude from the circular shell .",
    "this result , the increase of the [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratio at larger distances and the decrease of the radial velocity at the tips of a1a2 suggest an interaction between the jet fronts and the circular shell , in a similar way to that reported in , e.g. , ngc6891 ( guerrero et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize the extraordinary similarity between ic4846 and the well - known pn ngc6543 ( see miranda & solf 1992 and reed et al .",
    "the following structural components are common to these two pne ( we will use for ngc6543 the nomenclature of miranda & solf 1992 ) :    1 .   _ basic elongated shell(s ) . _ in ngc6543 two shells",
    "are observed , an outer bipolar shell with a bright ring between the lobes and an inner elliptical one . in ic4846 two elongated shells",
    "are suggested by the images ( but see above ) .",
    "the possible existence of an equatorial ring should be confirmed by new data .",
    "2 .   _ bipolar knots at the tips of the shell . _",
    "the knots ff in ngc6543 correspond to b1b2 in ic4846 .",
    "_ precessing bipolar jets . _",
    "the bipolar jets jj in ngc6543 correspond to a1a2 in ic4846 .",
    "the similarity between jj and a1a2 is extraordinary . both appear off - axis with respect to the orientation of the basic shell and are curved , with a change of orientation of 5@xmath1710@xmath17 .",
    "the radial velocity presents an identical variation along the jets with a steady increase up to a maximum radial velocity and a small decrease at their tips .",
    "finally , an expansion velocity of @xmath1 100200 kms@xmath2 is obtained in both cases .",
    "4 .   _ point - symmetric components perpendicular to the radial direction . _",
    "c1c2 in ic4846 could correspond to dd in ngc6543 .",
    "there are some differences between both objects , but these are most likely attributable to different orientations , ages and distances .",
    "whatever these differences , the conspicuous kinematic and structural similarities lead us to conclude that ngc6543 and ic4846 have shared a similar formation history .",
    "an interesting result in ic4846 is the systemic velocity shifts among the different components and the centroid of the nebula . in the case of b1b2 and c1c2 , the shifts are only slightly larger than the relative errors and we can not conclude whether they are real . in the case of a1a2 , however , the shift is noticeable and we consider it real . both the remarkable spatial and velocity symmetry observed in a1a2 exclude that this shift may be ascribed to different ejection velocity , changes ( deceleration ) in the velocity in one of the components of the pair , different ejection angle or a combination of the three .",
    "a more plausible explanation is that the systemic velocity of a1a2 is indeed intrinsically different from that of the other components and , in particular , from that of the emission centroid .",
    "similar shifts in the systemic velocity of collimated outflows and shell have been recently reported in the pn hu2 - 1 ( miranda et al .",
    "furthermore , both pne share the presence of two systems of collimated outflows at different orientations , one of them projected along the nebular major axis and one off - axis , suggesting a parallel formation history .",
    "moreover , inspection of the kinematic data of ngc6543 ( see miranda & solf 1992 ) suggests that a difference of @xmath22 7 kms@xmath2 could exist between the systemic velocity of jj and the systemic velocity of the nebula as defined by the rest of components . in the case of hu2 - 1 ,",
    "the shifts of systemic velocity have been interpreted as a direct evidence of orbital motion of the ejection source in a binary central star ( miranda et al .",
    "the velocity shifts detected in ic4846 fit also into this framework . if a1a2 are ejected from a star in a binary system , the space velocity of the a1a2 will contain an additional velocity component due to the orbital motion , besides to the component due to the own ejection velocity .",
    "accordingly , the systemic velocity of a1a2 will be shifted from that of the emission centroid of the nebula ( see miranda et al . 2000 for details ) .",
    "we note that the same would apply to b1b2 and c1c2 if their observed velocity shifts were real .",
    "the systemic velocity shift of a1a2 ( 10 kms@xmath2 ) is very similar to that found in hu2 - 1 ( 8 kms@xmath2 ) and in ngc6543 ( 7 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "consequently , the orbital parameters of their binary central stars should be rather similar as well , with an orbital separation @xmath3 30 au and an orbital period @xmath3 100 yr , thus linking the central stars of these nebulae to symbiotic stars .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the central star of ic4846 , similarly to that of hu2 - 1 and ngc6543 , is a binary star in which mass transfer from a red giant leads to the formation of an accretion disk about a secondary ( mastrodemos & morris 1998 , 1999 ) , from which collimated ejections may be generated .",
    "narrow  band imaging and high  resolution spectroscopy of the pn ic4846 in the [ n  ii]@xmath96583 and h@xmath0 lines have revealed a complex structure similar in many respects to that of ngc6543 .",
    "the most remarkable components in ic4846 are three pairs of point - symmetric structures oriented at different directions .",
    "two ( and probably the three ) pairs represent collimated bipolar outflows . the kinematics and morphology of the pair observed at pa  54@xmath17 ( a1a2 )",
    "are highly suggestive of a precessing jet moving at @xmath1 100200 kms@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the velocity shift between their systemic velocity and that of the nebula can be interpreted as a result of orbital motion of the ejection source in a binary central star .",
    "this kind of systemic velocity differences has also been observed in hu2 - 1 and could be present in ngc6543 .",
    "thus , the formation of ic4846 ( and hu2 - 1 and ngc6543 ) could be related to physical processes in the own evolution of interacting binary stars .",
